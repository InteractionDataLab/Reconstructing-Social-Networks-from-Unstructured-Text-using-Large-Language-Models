UC_Davis,2013,Team:UC Davis#Notebook#Week 8_-_-_TEXT.html," tomorrow. In addition, we ran several different PCR reactions involving our TAL repressors and pSB3K3 . We decided to lower the template concentration for the TAL repressors in order to address the issue of streakiness. In addition, we ran a single reaction with no polymerase to see if there would still be streakiness without the polymerases. The streakiness was still present in all of the lanes, except the lane with no polymerase. This leads us to believe that there might be nonspecific annealing during PCR. We also chose to amplify pSB3K3 with Taq and Pfu instead of Phusion polymerase. Each of these tubes had an annealing temperature at 64, 60, or 55 degrees C. We also began the initial modeling of our construct with MATLAB and continued updating our wiki.

Today we had a NorCal iGEM team meetup here at Davis, where we met up with UC Berkeley, Stanford-Brown, and UCSF to discuss our projects in further detail. We each received valuable feedback on our projects and ended the day with a round of bowling. After everyone had left, we headed back to the lab. We decided to combine all of the PCR reactions that had worked for the two TAL repressors, run them in a gel, and then purify the final product. We also did a PCR clean up on the pSB3K3 PCR product and checked on the Tecan and realized additional time was needed to finish the run.
8/15/13
We are still waiting for our oligos to come in for further Golden Gate Assembly. We measured the DNA concentrations for our two Golden Gate-ready TAL repressors and analyzed some of the data involving BBa_K750000 and BBa_K598010 from the Tecan. The data seemed to show that the presence of arabinose or theophylline did not have a significant effect on overall fluorescence. We believe that DH10B may have heightened expression of AraC that results in greater repression of GFP. For most of the day, we either worked on modeling or updating the Wiki. We hope to start doing Golden Gate Assembly tomorrow.
8/16/13
We received the oligos necessary for Golden Gate Assembly, but realized that the larger oligos were delivered in amounts of 200 nanograms. We decided that we should amplify the products, so we ordered more primers for further PCR of these oligos. We hope to get them by Wednesday at the latest. We continued updating the Wiki and designed primers for sequencing"

Dr. Paula Turkon
Dr. Paula Turkon has a complex hydroponic setup on the other side of Ithaca, on South Hill at Ithaca College. She thought that teaching students about sustainability through the installation and upkeep of a hydroponic system at the university would not only be a valuable learning experience in sustainability but also provide an introduction into a growing practice for more controlled food production. She explained to us how here set-up worked, and how Ithaca College’s cafeteria actively used the herbs produced hydroponically in meals for students. To monitor the hydroponic s a variety of factors are checked, including pH, water quality, and conductivity. However, oxidative stress is not taken into account, meaning OxyPonics would be a novel implementation.
When asked about struggles of hydroponic farming, Dr. Turkon mentioned that cost is one of the biggest issues and causes of failure for hydroponic farms. She said if our product could increase profit margins, it would help the hydroponic industry grow. Since OxyPonics would increase plant yield, we believe there is tangible need for our product. Additionally, OyxPonics would need to priced affordably. We addressed this issue by instead of creating an entirely new hydroponic set-up, creating components such as a rail system and dialysis rings that could be adapted and and installed into existing hydroponic set-ups.
Next, a point Dr. Turkon made clear is that personally she did not have much of a technical background and many she knew in the hydroponic industry were the same. Our team worked hard to make OxyPonics utilization intuitive and easy. The user interface additionally features data in visual form so that it is easy to grasp, and overall data analysis that one can interact with quite naturally.

Dr. Miguel A. Pineros
Dr. Miguel Pineros, a professor at the School of Integrative Plant Science at Cornell, was enthusiastic about our project and approach. As we toured his greenhouse experiments where he had his own hydroponic set-ups, he excitedly told us that “most of where interesting science happens is at the interface of different sciences,” referring to how we were combining synthetic biology with plant sciences - two fields which typically do not interact in academia.

The BPA degradation products 1,2-Bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)-2-propanol and 2,2-Bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)-1-propanol were identified via MS-MS (m/z: 243 / 225 / 211 / 135) and only occured in cultivations with E. coli expressing BisdA and BisdB together. Sasaki et al. (2005) reported the same MS-MS results for 1,2-Bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)-2-propanol and 2,2-Bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)-1-propanol when degrading BPA with S. bisphenolicum AO1 as we observed in our BPA degradation experiments.
We could also identify the BPA degradation products when working with E. coli TOP10 and MACH1 (data not shown) but because we want to fuse BisdA and BisdB to S-layer proteins which we express in E. coli KRX the characterizations of <partinfo>K123000</partinfo> and <partinfo>K123001</partinfo> were carried out in this strain.
Modelling of intracellular bisphenol A degradation
The modelling was done with the software Berkeley Madonna using the common fourth-order Runge-Kutta method to solve the equations. The model was fitted to the measured data shown above by the function ""curve fit"" in Berkeley Madonna to calculate the parameters, constants etc.
To model the BPA degradation by E. coli carrying BioBricks for BPA degradation (<partinfo>K123000</partinfo> and <partinfo>K123001</partinfo>) the cell growth has to be described first to calculate a specific BPA degradation rate per cell. The observed growth of E. coli on (our) LB medium was diauxic with two different growth phases. Cell growth is a first-order reaction and is mathematically described as

BostonU,2014,Team:BostonU#HumanPractices_-_-_TEXT.html," by BDAC. In October, we will   have a final NEGEM meeting. Each team will give a formal presentation,   representative of how they will present at the iGEM Giant Jamboree. This will be an   opportunity to give final advice about the project and how to present it. We will also   have time to show off our Wiki pages and make any last minute changes before the   wiki freeze.
Google Glass
Throughout the summer we met up with students from the Wellesley HCI Lab to teach them about biological concepts and lab protocols and to learn about their projects. In past collaborations with Wellesley, our iGEM teams have mostly used their surface projects. This year, the Wellesley lab had a new technology project, the Google Glass. Our team felt that the Google Glass could have practical applications to the wetlab. We thought it would be an ideal tool for doing hands-free checklists for protocols, so we worked with the Wellesley HCI Lab this summer to incorporate our protocols into the Glass platform. They were able to upload our miniprep and transformation protocols on the Google Glass, which allowed us to see the protocol step by step without carrying around our notebooks.
Alan using the Google Glass in the Wellesley HCI Computer lab
While we tested the Glass miniprep protocol over the course of a few weeks, we discovered some pros and cons to using the Glass in the lab. The pros of using Glass: (1) it allowed us to go through a protocol without a printed paper copy, (2) it allowed us to take photos of our plates and tubes as we worked, and (3) it was lightweight and easy to wear. The cons of using Glass: (1) it heated up after 10-15 minutes of constant use, causing us to remove the Glass and thus preventing us from finishing a 45-minute protocol in one sitting, (2) we had to touch the side of the Glass with our gloved hands to progress through protocols, and (3) it didn't always respond to our motions when taking pictures. With these results in mind, we decided not to integrate Glass into the Chimera workflow. While Glass is not a part of our current workflow, we believe it could eventually become a very useful tool in the wetlab.
We were also able to provide a “client prospective” for the Wellesley HCI Lab's projects. Since they are developing software for use in the lab, we helped them decide which features would be most useful and improvements that could make their products more appealing.

Introduction to the off-target model
Our project involves employing Cas13a for detecting antibiotic resistance genes. Cas13a acts like a detective that can signal the presence of specific RNA sequences. Its target description is provided by a specific single guide RNA sequence, denoted as the crRNA, that is positioned (loaded) within the protein. Cas13a is activated when the loaded crRNA pairs with a complementary (target) sequence. The crRNA is therefore essential in directing Cas13a towards a predefined target. Besides specific target recognition, proteins from the CRISPR-Cas family may also exhibit off-target activity. While offering possibilities to target related variants of antibiotic resistance genes, this off-target activity could also compromise the reliability of a Cas13a-based detection system. We address this problem by employing a recently proposed kinetic model ( Klein et al. 2017 ) to describe the off-target effects of our detection system for a given crRNA. As such, we are able to rank potential crRNAs - derived from our motif finding algorithm - by their reliability. In addition, these modelling efforts revealed a design flaw in one of the crRNAs, guiding the labteam towards the right crRNA sequences to utilize in our experiments.
The kinetic model we used was designed for proteins similar to Cas9, and required adjustment, as Cas13a has interesting properties that the model was not developed for. Cas13a has a seed region central to the spacer ( Abudayyeh et al. 2016 ), while other Cas protein variants, including Cas9, have a 3’-end seed ( Semenova et al. 2011 ). In addition, for Cas13a, a protospacer flanking site (PFS) – a nucleotide 3’ to the target that should not be guanine - is important, rather than a protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) - a nucleotide sequence next to the non-target strand of for example Cas9 ( Shmakov et al. 2015 ). This can attributed to the fact that Cas13a detects single strand RNA sequences, rather than double stranded DNA sequences. As a result, we set the model’s energy associated to PAM-binding to 0. The process of target binding with a central seed region is illustrated in Figure 1 below.

Applications for molecular beacons
Molecular beacons can be applied to a wide range of biological and diagnostical studies. Whenever there is a specific nucleic acid which is supposed to be detected they can be utilized. Molecular beacons are used for the detection and distinction of retroviral DNA from different types of HIV, for instance ( Marras et al., 2006 ). Even for indentification of proteins which interact with DNA or RNA they are useful. In sum, there are a lot of opportunities to apply molecular beacons ( Antony & Subramaniam, 2001 ):
Detection of PCR amplification products
Mutational analysis
Genotyping and allele discrimination
Clinical diagnosis
Oligonucleotide degradation studies
Analysis of DNA/RNA hybridization
Realtime visualization of hybridization in cells
Analysis of triplex DNA formation
Protein/DNA interaction
Enzymatic assays
Biosensors

Modeling: Phylogenetic Trees
Phylogenetic analysis requires little pre-existing literature in order to construct a predictive evolutionary model, because a phylogeny’s strength of prediction is based on analysis of biological sequences, data that is now readily available. This method of modeling is favorable for novel bacteriocin research because of the limited literature available for these bacteriocins.
The hybrid bacteriocin lacticin Q-lacticin Z was successfully created by University of Southern Denmark’s 2016 iGEM team [1]. Because these class II lacticin bacteriocins have been hybridized before, we hypothesize that the lacticin bacteriocin, lacticin Z, will have a greater affinity for hybridization with another bacteriocin that is evolutionarily similar to itself. Through the reconstruction of a phylogenetic tree and through review of past literature, we determined two bacteriocins that are suitable for hybridization: aureocin A53 and epidermicin NI01.
Summary of Results
We created a phylogenetic tree with relative divergence times using 93 chosen bacteriocin protein sequences, with the majority of the sequences belonging to class II bacteriocins—the same class as lacticin Z. The bacteriocins were then grouped into clades on the basis of similar divergence times (≥ 0.17) to the outgroup, a class of bacteriocins known as colicins. Out of the 17 clades produced, for each clade, we then reviewed past literature in order to see if there was a correlation between divergence time and conservation of bacteriocin function, especially for clades close to lacticin Z, a statement that would support our hypothesis of hybridization.
We found that 8 out of the 17 bacteriocin clades (47%) had some form of conserved function and mode of action, including the clade that contained lacticin Z. These eight clades were groups from either class I, class IIa, or class IId. Supporting the correlation between bacteriocin functionality and sequence homology, especially in the classes mentioned, was the fact that all but one of these 8 clades had a divergence time less than or equal to 0.04. Furthermore, nearly all class I bacteriocins analyzed belonged to one"

Error prone PCR for the low level mutation frequency for LDH is unsucessfull while the rest shows positive results after gel electrophoresis.
Week 4
Wet Lab:
As the error-prone PCR products only contains the RBS and the mutant gene, we assemble the gene into an expression device. First, we ligated our PCR products in front of pLac and transformed it into DH5a. This step allows us to separate the PCR products as every fragment carries different mutations. For each mutation rate, only 8 colonies are picked for overnight culture.We continued on our LDH and LDP projects. We digested and ligated the mutants to a double terminator. It was very labourous as there are 24 samples in total. We then picked the colonies for overnight cuture. Plasmid extraction is carried out the next day and sent for sequencing. We listed down the mutations that have occured to check whether a missense mutation or a frameshift mutation have occured. Those that has frameshift occuring nearing the N-teminal of the gene is discared.
Moreover, we also constructed a reporter device for our RBS mutagenesis charecterisation. This will be used as the template for site directed mutaganesis on the RBS sequence. At the same time, 36 primers were orders for the the site directed mutagenesis of RBS.

Week 1
Wet Lab:
After sequence verification, we digested and ligated the expression construct of mutant LDP and LDH from pSB1A2 to pHG101. The ligation product is transformed into the E. Coli strain WM3064, reason for this step can be found here . We picked one colony for each mutant for overnight culture. After that we conjugated our expression construct of mutant LDP and LDH in pHG101 into S. Oneidensis.
On the other hand, site directed mutagenesis of the RBS is carried out upon arrival of our 36 primers. The PCR products are then directly transformed into DH5a. 29 out of 36 grew colonies(some has only one colony). For those that didn't grow, transformations was carried out agian.
Only one colony was picked from each of the 36 plates and inoculated in LB for overnight culture. Picture on the left shows colonies carrying the reporter with the 5th base pair of RBS substituted from A to T"

Screen shot of Ribo Key & Lock Generator in TU Delft 2009’s wiki page
Abstract: TU Delft 2009 wanted to build an improved cell to cell communication system.  They wanted to construct an E.coli strain that can pass GFP signals through conjugation only once. When “initiator cells” which contains the “signal plasmid” for the communication system, is added to a cell culture, the initiator cells (donor cells) conjugate with other cells “non-initiator” cells in the culture. During the conjugation, the signal plasmid is transferred to the recipient cells. The signal plasmid encodes for an entry exclusion protein, an endonuclease, and GFP. It has a restriction site of the endonuclease. The entry exclusion protein prevents backward conjugation, the endonuclease and the restriction site can reset the cell back to off state, and finally GFP can a reporter to visualize where the signal is.  The expression of endonuclease should be delayed because cells, which just received the signal plasmid, require time to conjugate and pass down the signal plasmid to the recipient cells. TU Delft 2009 tried to solve this problem by introducing a delay device.  The riboregulator system was used for their RNA-based delay system. By having another level of regulation between the reception of signal and expression of self-destructing protein (e.g. endonuclease), Delft 2009 believed that there could be delayed expression of the self-destructing protein. TU Delft 2009 also designed an algorithm called Ribo Key & Lock Generator that can generate sequences for lock and key riboregulators when RBS sequence is used as an input.

Project Experiments
Proteorhodopsin was characterized using four assays: a growth assay, a cytotoxicity assay, an ATP/ADP ratio assay, and a 24 hour pH measurement assay . The protein requires retinal to fold correctly and imbed itself into the cellular membrane and also requires light to activate the proton pump.  We decided to test 4 experimental groups: an active culture induced with beta-carotene and light, one induced with light without beta-carotene, one induced with beta-carotene without light, and the last exposed to neither light nor beta-carotene . The cultures with beta-carotene were given 20uM of beta-carotene. Groups induced with light were incubated exposed to a 200W equivalent LED bulb, which was measured to output .34mW at 520nm perfectly suitable to power proteorhodopsin. Groups not induced with light were wrapped in aluminum-foil to prevent exposure.
Our NOX expression system was characterized in a dissolved oxygen assay to measure the impact that the H2O forming NOX had on a sample of aerated PBS. Several attempts were also made to his-tag purify the protein and confirm its presence using SDS-PAGE.
General Growth Curve
A growth assay was conducted comparing control BL21 E. coli to E. coli transformed with NOX and E. coli transformed with Proteorhodopsin + Blh expression plasmids, BBa_K2182003  and BBa_K2182002 respectively. The main goal of this assay was to compare the metabolic stress of the plasmids and see whether or not the plasmids caused a significant decrease in the growth rate of the chassis bacteria. Cultures were grown with agitation in 2 mL of LB broth at 37 degrees celsius and diluted to an OD600 of 0.1 at the start of analysis. OD600 was taken at 20 minute intervals  for the first 5.5 hours,  with an additional time-point taken at 10 hours.

Microfluidic Modules
We dedicated this section for our microfluidic chip designs as a way of highlighting the potential for open-source community based module sharing. In the world of microfluidics, form begets function thus the heart of any functional chip is the circuit layout itself. The process of designing and testing chips for proper function is a very time consuming and laborious task so our future goal is to aid teams and researchers with the ability to tweak already existing designs to fit their need rather than starting from scratch. We would like to invite iGEM teams as well as established laboratories working with microfluidics to host their designs for the world to tweak and share. A large part of the scientific community is moving toward more open-source research and our hope is to establish a free-to-access repository of modules leveraging web-hosting infrastructure like GitHub already in place for the distribution of a wide variety of digital media. Below are some of the designs we produced along the way:

The resulting liquid became yellow in color after 1 minute incubation at room temp. This module can be used as a protocol validation tool for troubleshooting every aspect of microfluidic chip master mold production.

RNA Strand Displacement In Vitro
Previously:
In 2011, Lulu Qian and Erik Winfree, researchers at Caltech, published a paper entitled ""Scaling Up Digital Circuit Computation with DNA Strand Displacement Cascades."" This paper demonstrated how scalable logic circuits based on DNA strand displacement are capable of processes as complicated as the square root function. See our motivation page for more details.
MIT iGEM 2012:
Before our team attempted to bring the mechanism of strand displacement into an in vivo context, we first decided to assay strand displacement in vitro using RNA. We used 2'-O-methylated RNA strands, which had not been shown to undergo strand displacement in vitro. Before creating our own constructs, we adapted sequences from the Qian/Winfree paper to RNA.
MIT iGEM Foundational Experiment:
Figure A shows a foundational in vitro RNA strand displacement experiment that was performed on a plate reader. The negative control, in black, is a well that received only an annealed reporter complex. The bottom strand of this complex is the gate strand, T*-S6*, with the 3' end tagged with the ROX fluorophore. The top strand of the complex is the output strand, S6. This is complementary to the S6* domain of the gate strand. The 5' end is tagged with the Iowa Black RQ quencher, which absorbs the ROX fluorescence; thus, when the two strands of the reporter are annealed, no fluorescence should be observed.  The positive control, in red, is the input strand, T-S6, annealed to the gate strand, T*-S6* tagged with ROX. This is what we would expect the product of a strand displacement reaction to look like. We can see that in the experimental well, when the input is present, it can bind to the exposed T* domain of the reporter and displace the output strand, yielding a fluorescent complex and a waste strand.

Edinburgh_UG,2017,Team:Edinburgh UG#Description_-_-_TEXT.html,"                 This highlights how site-specific recombinase could be superior to alternative genetic engineering methods                 in terms of organismal flexibility.
SSR performs novel function unachievable in other genetic engineering systems
SSR, unlike other genetic engineering systems, can make dynamic changes to genetic constructs. It is capable                 of catalyzing not only excision, but also integration, translocation, and inversion, which are highly inefficient                 and difficult, if not impossible, to perform using other genetic engineering systems. These special properties                 have allowed researchers to build novel devices with applications ranging from studying brain function through                 tagging individual neurons , to speeding up bone healing by gene therapy.
More importantly, the existence of many orthogonal site-specific recombinases means that multiple genetic engineering                 can occur in parallel without affecting each other. They have been employed in efficient genetic assembly ,                 as well as the creation of a six-input biological logic gate .                 In our project, we also demonstrated the utility of multiple orthogonal systems through gene randomiser,                 logic gates, and pulse generator .
SSR complements other genetic engineering technology
Although SSR itself is already a powerful genetic tool, its functionality can be greatly expanded when used in                 conjunction with tools such as CRISPR/Cas9. One of the major inconveniences of using SSR is the need to introduce                 a target site into the genome of the organism; this could be easily solved by CRISPR/Cas9, which induces                 homology-directed repair (HDR) to integrate transgene into the host genome. On the other hand, CRISPR/Cas9                 may not be the best tool when fine spatiotemporal control is required; SSR would be more suitable in this                 case.
It is therefore not surprising that researchers are already using SSR and CRISPR/Cas9 together in experiments.                 They are already used in applications such as engineering stem cells [5], speeding up vaccine development                 [6], studying cancer mechanism [7] and parasite infection [8], and more.
SSR technology is not fully exploited
While researchers have benefitted enormously from the development of a few recombinases (Cre and FLP being the                 prime examples), we realise that the potential of SSR in genetic engineering is yet to be fully exploited                 because of the limited choices of well-characterized recombinases. The activity of recombinases varies between                 in vitro and in vivo conditions, between organisms, and even between tissue types. For example, Cre recombinase                 is shown to be toxic in mouse lungs and hearts. The limited choices of recombinases and their incomprehensive                 testing put"
Aachen,2014,Team:Aachen#Collaborations#Freiburg_-_-_TEXT.html," matrix patterns from polypropylen foil. The masks can be used to cover the plates from the top or from the bottom.
AcCELLoMatrix masks
These masks can be placed on top or beneath 384-well plates to facilitate localized illumination of wells.
AcCELLoMatrix Reader App
After mask have been designed and the information was encoded into the well plate by selectively illuminating the cells, how do you get it out again? We made an app for that: the AcCELLoMatrix Reader for Windows Phone 8.
We designed the app to be easy to use: A user can simply open the app
Usage of AcCELLoMatrix Reader
(1) Start the app and read through some brief instructions (2). Then start scanning and aim for a datamatrix in the wild (3). As soon as a datamatrix is detected in the preprocessed frames (4, small rectangle) by the ZXing algorithm, the decoded text is displayed to the user (5).
While the apps frontend is designed to be very minimalistic, there's actually going on a lot in the backend. Visual data coming from the camera feed has to be processed and fed into the ZXing decoding algorithm.
Activity diagram of the app
After the app was started and the scanning initiated by the user, a loop is initiated. Filters are applied to camera preview frames and the result is fed into the decoding algorithm. As soon as a datamatrix is detected, the loop is interrupted and the result presented to the user.
Outlook
Due to the circumstance that this collaboration was started relatively late, we have not been able to test the decoding of real AcCELLoMatrixes. But we are confident, that with some threshold adjustments to the AcCELLoMatrixes Reader app and maybe the hole-size of the polypropylen masks, the coding and decoding of short text information in the genetic state of mammalian cells in a 384-well plate is perfectly possible.

What is Snake35?
This year, iGEM Waterloo has chosen a foundational advance project. These types of projects focus on the technology and processes involved in synthetic biology, which are not very well-known to the general public. In contrast to other types of projects, foundational advance projects do not usually focus on a single application, such as curing a disease. Furthermore, they tend to have less popular buzzwords for the general public. As such, it can be difficult to explain the idea and purpose of our foundational advance project to the general public.
After consulting iGEM Imperial 2016’s Visualization: A Guide for Synthetic Biologists , we decided a great way to convey the information from our project would be to create a visual, interactive game! We’ve called it Snake35.
Instructions
What makes Snake35 different than classic Snake? Well for starters, your objective is no longer just to make the biggest, baddest snake of all time. Our point-based version requires you to match a CFP block next to a YFP block in order to excite it. For every YFP in the excited, fluorescing state, you receive a point. However, if you have a YFP that isn’t beside CFP, it stays dark (deactivated) and you don’t receive a point. Get the highest score and give yourself a pat on the back!
In our game, you must assemble a blue block next to a dim yellow block in order to score points. The result of successfully doing so causes the yellow block to fluoresce which is analogous to our FRET experiment. This game demonstrates how you must organize the proteins in a specific arrangement to observe fluorescence of YFP. However, if you have a Sup35 in between a YFP and a CFP, the YFP will not fluoresce as the arrangement is not correct.
Testing Snake35
During the Waterloo Faculty of Science Open House, our booth had a table where we displayed and presented Snake35. Kids got the chance to play the game and learn about the foundational concepts of FRET. Our game received lots of positive feedback from kids and parents alike which proves that our demonstration tool was very effective in conveying the information we wanted!

When running the gibson optimization module, the program will ask the user for a melting temperature and a salt concentration.  The recommended gibson assembly temperature is 48C from NEB, while the standard salt concentration for a gibson reaction is around 0.05M, or 50mM.  The user can tune either parameter to their specifications, however, note a high salt concentration and/or low melting temperature input can result in primers being more than several degrees apart in melting temperature.  The melting temperature of the primer is calculated via these formulas .
The script will then generate the junction between the fragments to calculate the optimal homology overlap and primer extension to match the temperature and salt requirement.  The process of gibson primer design is indicated in the figure below, adapted from NEB .  These will then be output in a text file in a readable format.

Sample output files are included for Protein Optimization and Gibson processes on github, and linked in iGEM under ""Input File Formatting"".

OVERVIEW
Modeling is a useful and powerful tool, which can reduce the waste of time in experiments and predict a proper direction of our work. Thus, the modeling work is essential dealing to the complexity of E.co-lock.
In E.co-lock, we developed layered AND gates to simulate the construction of electronic lock. At the same time, a common quorum sensing system: Min system is also introduced in E.co-lock. Therefore, we developed an integral and excellent modeling to our system. We will introduce our model to you one by one and at last we have a combination of these model. In particular, we described and solved following questions:
(1) The condition of sensors after adding different inducers.
(2) The effect of quorum control inducer（AHL） to a single cell
(3) The cell density influenced by MIN system
(4) A connection of layered logic gates and MIN system
Small RNAs Regulatory System Model
sRNAs can regulate protein expression by pairing with target mRNAs. We construct an easy model for this process by the equations as follows[1]:
Then we wrote some other equations which describe the normal condition (without sRNA) of mRNA and proteins. We removed the equation for sRNA and the factor related to sRNA in other equations:
The parameters are the same as previous described. We combined (I) and (II) by time parameter. At first we use equations (II) to simulate the normal process of transcription and translation. After some time we use the equations (I) to simulate the repression the process in which sRNAs pair with target mRNAs. The figure 1.1 shows the results.
Because the parameter μ is not a certain number that can be tested by experiment, we use different value of μ to simulate the process. The results shows as figure 1.2:
From our experimental data, the efficiency of sRNAs selected by ourselves are around 55%. According to these data we chose the value of μ that can suit the experimental data best so that we can have better  simulation for next big model: Layered AND gates.

The construction strategy we use for this model is the same as sRNA’s. We wrote a series of differential equations associated with each other to simulate the dynamic change of all the materials (including inducers, mRNAs, sRNAs and proteins).In this model, we"

DTU-Denmark,2017,Team:DTU-Denmark#ExperimentalDesign_-_-_TEXT.html," as a reporter instead of using chromoproteins.
By cleavage of the linker molecules by snake venom, the enzymes would be released from the Avidin/biotin surface into the eluent, just as the chromoproteins would. However, when using enzymes as reporters, the eluent would subsequently flow into a secondary reaction chamber, where the concentration of eluted reporter enzyme would be determined by a colorimetric assay. As each enzyme would catalyse multiple substrate molecules, we would expect a decrease in the necessary incubation time between the venom and our fusion protein.
To demonstrate the concept, we used β-galactosidase as a reporter, and ortho-Nitrophenyl-β-D-Galactopyranoside (ONPG) as a substrate for the secondary colorimetric assay.
The Single chain Avidin (ScAvidin) is the same as the one used for the amilCP based composite parts, with the only difference being in the ribosome binding site, where a stronger RBS (B0030) was selected.
As this composite part was a proof-of-concept for the effect of using an enzyme as a reporter, the linker used for this composite part was the empirical FRET linker mentioned earlier, as we were fairly sure our venom would exhibit some activity against this linker.
The composite β-galactosidase part was used in several proof-of-concept experiments. It was used without the addition of snake venom to prove that the ScAvidin part binds the expressed fusion protein to the biotinylated beads. It was also used to evaluate the effect of snake venom on the empirical FRET linker.
Alternative approach
In our project, we wanted to express the whole biosensor construct as a single, composite part. However, that approach has some disadvantages. Namely, the complexity of the part creates difficulties in transforming and expressing it in competent hosts, and avidin containing recombinant proteins had low rate of success in our experiments.
An alternative approach to our design of the biosensor, would be to express a protein that contains a linker and the chromophore protein amilCP that has the His tag on its C-terminus. The expressed protein would then be His-tag purified, and biotinylated at the N-terminus with a chemical reaction. The biotinylated construct can be bound to streptavidin beads, which are widely used in molecular biology applications.
The final biosensor would share the same principles with our original design, but would result in our opinion in a better success"

I did fluorescence experiment as shown here for negative cascade sample, locks and keys and their corresponding controls. Unfortunately the results looked same in both uninduced and induced state. Domenico suggested to ask Emrah to get something from the results. I got nice GFP glowing positive control on plate. So I prepared the overnight cultures for samples to be tested tomorrow.

DTU-Denmark,2014,Team:DTU-Denmark#Project#Background_-_-_TEXT.html," a potential risk of inflammatory response. However, the possibility for normal cells to become cancer cells is very low, so the amount of cell death caused by our circuit actually is little. The inflammatory response is a macroscopical phenomenon and it requires a certain amount of cell necrosis, not that little. Moreover, resent research has found some regulatory factors to decide RIP1/RIP3 to cause apoptosis or necrosis, and the inducement work from necrosis and apoptosis of RIP1 is done by some scientists. So we can expect this side effect of RIP1 and RIP3 can be overcome. In addition, apoptin<a class=""quote"">[2]</a>, another suicide gene we have tested, does not have this side effect because it only cause apoptosis. Apoptin may become a better suicide gene because it specifically causes apoptosis in cancer cells. Though in our test it didn't show as stable effect as RIP1 and RIP3, by optimizing the circuit and transfection condition, we can expect that it will become the protagonist of our suicide gene.
RIP1 and RIP3 are anthropogenic genes and apoptin is a chicken source gene. They can only cause cell death in a specific condition of eukaryotic cell, so it's relatively safe. And because they only cause cell death, they can hardly be separated without control because the ""uncontrollable"" spread is automatically prevented because without the circuit the cell dies. Thus we think these suicide genes are safe and have little risk of wrongly spread. VP3 is an interesting protein with the ability to only lead to apoptosis in cancer cells. Its safety has been proved in various types of cell lines by many papers. However, since it was derived from chicken anemia virus,enough tests should be done before transfect this protein into mammalian cells, especially mouse and human iPSCs.
Laboratory safety
Researcher safety
All the experiments have been done according to laboratory safety rules of Sun Yat-sen University, and experimenters have been rigorously trained before practice to guarantee the safety and health of team members.The cell we used in every experiment is harmless to the experimenters. We also used lentivirus in some experiments. Lentivirus is risk group 2+ and may cause infection under improper usage. We are fully alert to it and operate carefully. Experimenters only use lentivirus vector on super clean bench in special room. We strictly follow the protocol and avoid careless operation.
Public safety
The circuit we designed cannot function outside certain cell lines in the laboratory, and the lentivirus we used cannot auto-replicated and only serves as a one-off vector"

University of Georgia
The University of Georgia iGEM team is continuing their work    on developing the archaeal Methanococcus maripaludis as an    inexpensive chassis for synthetic biochemical production    with a current focus on engineering the ribosomal binding    site (RBS). An mCherry reporter is used to measure protein    expression. In the team's efforts to standardize    fluorescence measurements and collect data, we are helping    the UGA iGEM team characterize RBS variants by measuring    mCherry fluorescence levels using flow cytometry and    performing statistical analysis.
Imperial College London
The Imperial College London iGEM team are working on a    co-culture technology that allows for self-regulating    artificial cell population ratios through cell communication    and regulation. As such, the team is also collecting data on    growth conditions in various medias. Here, we contributed to    the team's efforts by providing data on Pseudomonas    putida growth at different mixture ratios of LB and BHI    and determining the growth curve in each mixture at OD    600. This effort also benefitted us by granting us insight    into how P. putida containing our construct will fare in    these mixed media conditions compared to the wild-type    strain.
Genspace
The Genspace iGEM team is a team composed of high-schoolers    and citizen scientists working at a community laboratory. As    such, access to certain lab equipment is typically    limited. As a result, the Columbia iGEM team have worked    with the team members to help collect data on their    behalf. This year, we aided the Genspace team in their    efforts to collect data for the UGA-Georgia    team 1 and characterize    constructs by collecting data on cell growth at OD 700 and    collecting mTurquoise2 and mCherry fluorescence.

E. coligy: Plants with BanAphids
Our goal is to create a sustainable system to reduce the damage that aphids cause to our agricultural industry and reduce the use of insecticides.
The current solution usually requires huge amounts of insecticides, damaging ecosystems in several ways. First, the indiscriminate weakening of insects means that beneficial insects (pollinators, ...) are also affected. Second, insecticides affect vertebrates, including humans, damaging our health. Third, insecticide residues (catabolites) accumulate in each food-chain. The highest organism, be it humans or for example predatory birds, will end up with potentially high levels of residues and their negative effects.
We aim to offer an effective and sustainable alternative for insecticides. Our modified E. coli, the BanAphids (meaning ‘to ban aphids’ as well as provide"

It’s found that the increase of stimulation pressure does not change the pressure field distribution pattern and only the amplitude of pressure of each position was amplified proportionally to stimulation pressure.
In experiment, it was impossible to keep the distance between transducer interface and cell layer being precisely 1.0mm. It’s important to study how sensitive the pressure field distribution was to the distance error. Thus, Pressure distribution patterns in condition of +-0.2mm distance error were simulated to show the influence of distance error on pressure distribution pattern. Here follows the simulation result. In these simulations, the transducer interface pressure and other parameters other than distance are all the same.

From Fig. 11, we found that pressure distribution pattern of 1.1MHz ultrasound was a chaos. A little distance distortion can cause pressure distribution pattern changing greatly. The absolute pressure can’t be predicted by FEM simulation. 1.1MHz pressure is also not recommended for quantitative pressure-cell response relationship study.
Conclusion:
In this modeling, two ultrasonic devices were modeled to get the pressure field distribution for 108KHz and 1.1MHz frequencies. The pressure distribution of 108KHz transducer device is quite smooth and uniform just beneath the transducer interface. +-0.2mm/1mm (20%) displacement only leads to no more than 6% pressure change.

Construction of ODE equation
At our first step, we wanted to describe the system thoroughly without leaving out any seemingly unimportant actions and factors. As a result, the description of the system contains every possible mass actions as well as some hill kinetics, Henri-Michaelis-Menten. We came up a set of ODEs with 19 equations.
Figure 1 designed circuit of cell I
Figure 2 designed circuit of cell II
Promoter 1 and promoter 2 preceding lasR and luxR genes respectively are constant promoters, which will transcribe and translate into protein PlasR and PluxR. LA1 is the binding association of lasR and 30C12HSL(A2C1) and it can affect the subsequent promoter 2 which can be described by Hill Equation. The same goes to LA2. Gene luxI will be translated into protein PluxI which would generate 30C6HSL(A1C1) through enzymatic reaction. The AHL will diffuse through the membrane to the environment(A1e) and finally enter into Cell 2(A1C2). Protein PtetR which is translated from gene tetR represses promoter 5 which is responsible for transcription of gene lasI. Promoter 6 is constant for translation of protein PlasI. 30C12HSL(A2C2) is generated from Protein PlasI through enzymatic reaction. 30C12HSL in the environment is called A2e which will diffuse to Cell 1. aTc is added manipulatively to change the phase of oscillation by binding the protein PTetR. Therefore, we have these following ODEs:
Parameters
The parameters are inherent factors determining the behaviors, properties of a system. We selected the quantities thoughtfully from previous iGEM teams and some others were found from published papers.

We simulated this system by SIMBIOLOGY, a toolbox embedded in MATLAB. However, unaware of the key parameters to which the system is sensitive, we felt difficult to control or adjust properly, and the simulation result of the system came into a damped oscillation. We ascribed the"

As in most of   the  food  products,  it  is  the  economic  and  nutritional  benefits  that  they  look  for...and   simultaneously the product must be safe to use continuously.

Interpretation of data
The purpose is here to generate a consensus sequence for each sample, based on the alignement of the two chromatogram (AB1 file) obtained through GATC. This was performed with the Geneious De Novo Assembly tool.
Then, the Targeted Loci BLAST tool on NCBI enables to identify the strain.
Further investigations
Whole Genomic Sequencing was performed using Illumina® Technology at GATC®, for 5 strains (4 gram negative and one gram positive).
Genomic DNA extraction was performed with the Qiagen® DNeasy Blood & Tissue Kit.
The followed protocol was indicated in Qiagen® handbook. Notice that genomic extraction from gram positive bacteria needs additional lysis steps.
Fungal genomic DNA extraction and 18S PCR
Genomic DNA extraction
This protocol was inspired by a protocol called “Isolation of genomic DNA from fungi (culture and blood) using the QIAamp DNA Mini Kit” that can be found under the section user-developed protocol here
In this protocol we use lyticase, thus before doing our dna extraction we prepared lyticase aliquots:
Prepare XmL of TE.
Resuspend lyticase at a 10U/µL concentration.
Make 20µL aliquots (=200U).
Store in a freezer at -20°C (or the lyticase will loose efficiency)
DNA is isolated from fungi grown 48h to 72h on Sabouraud medium at 30°C, so 3 days before going through the dna extraction we inoculated our fungal strains on Sabouraud. As for genomic dna isolation:
Harvest colonies using an inoculating loop and resuspend them in 1 mL of 0.9% saline solution in 1,5 mL tubes, centrifuge and collect the cell pellets (we did by pipetting the supernatant).
Prepare a 50mM Tris, 10mM EDTA and 28mM β-mercaptoethanol solution. Add the lyticase to a 10U/mL concentration.
Add 500 µL lyticase solution to the cell pellets and incubate for 30 minutes at 37°C.
Centrifuge at full speed for 10 min then discard the supernatant. Resuspend the pellets in 180µL ATL buffer and 20 µL Proteinase K, and incubate at 55°C in water bath for 15 minutes.

JUDGING FORM ⇗
A software tool is defined as ""a program that is employed in the development, repair, or enhancement of other programs or of hardware."" Under this definition, the model devised by the SBR iGEM team ought to be eligible as a software tool, as it enhances the function of other programs. The main tenet of our collaboration with DTU was our ""cohesive"" process: that DTU's two programs form the ""beginning"" and the ""end"" of the transition of mycelium from spore to plug and from brick to freestanding structure, while SBR's program forms the ""middle""--the transformation of plug to brick. In that the SBR model enhances the function of DTU's two models, it ought to qualify as a software tool.
To read more about our model, please see the modeling entry here.
To read more about our collaboration with DTU on the model, and how these two may work together to produce a software tool, please see our collaboration entry here.
If the reader wishes to test out the model in its capacity as a software tool, a link to an online IDLE environment is provided here complete with the code base. To run the model, simply click on the green box in the upper left-hand corner marked ""run"", and follow the prompts given in the output box."

FLUORESCENT PROBE MODEL
Background
It can be seen from the reaction pathway that when the probe is excessive, the fluorescence                     intensity should be linear with the hydrogen peroxide content at a specific time. The model                     validates this linear relationship through experimental data and predicts future possible outcomes                     by constructing a linear regression model. Linear regression analysis
Definition
H2O2: The concentration of H2O2, units in mM.
FOD: Florescence intensity / OD.
Scatter Plot
The Scatter Plot of data are demonstrated below.
Fig.1
From the chart, it is clear that the FOD is in proportion to the H2O2, only                     when H2O2 is between                     0-2.5 mM. The data in the points that H2O2 is 5 are obviously not obeying                     linear model. Thus, we                     consider to building a linear model between 0 and 2.5mM of H2O2. The new                     Scatter Plot of this part                     of data is showed below.
Fig.2
The scatter plot witnessed a significant linearity of between FOD and H2O2,                     so we tend to use a                     linear model to predict and explain the results.
Model Construction
With the criteria of the least square, we construct following linear model
$$FOD_{i}=\beta_{0}+\beta_{1}\ H_{2}O_{2_{i}}+\epsilon_{i},\epsilon_{i} \sim                     N(0,\sigma^2)$$
The property of the model are demonstrated below
Fig.3
It is obvious that the data fits linear model well and the parameters are following
$$FOD_{i}=4752+1214.48\ H_{2}O_{2_{i}}+\epsilon_{i},\epsilon_{"

Charlotte
Picked 8 colonies for the plates containing cells tranformed with BolA_ind (psB1C3) and 8 for BolA_con (pSB4A5). The colonies on the plate containing cells transformed with INP_Sil_Sdom were still too small to pick so they were left to incubate at 37ºC a little longer before picking 8 colonies for colony PCR.
The colony PCR was done according to protocol, using DreamTaq polymerase. The PCR products were loaded on a 1% agarose gel for electrophoresis. Colony 16 didn't fit in the PCR machine anymore, so this colony is also not loaded on the gel.
Left is a simulated image by SnapGene, right the actual gel picture. For BolA_ind, colonies 2,3 and 4 had a band at the correct height. For BolA_con, colonies 11, 12 and 13 had a band at the correct height. For INP_Sil_Sdom, colonies 17, 19 and 20 were correct. These colonies were transferred to selective liquid LB and grown overnight in a shaker at 37ºC and 250 rpm.
Charlotte & Liza
Tested 15 µm fluorescent polystyrene beads in the MicroTime 200 confocal microscope to see if the microscope is able to establish lasing in a bead. We used a 1 mW laser with an excitation wavelength of 532 nm. The bead was imaged at different intensities to see if we were able to see a shift to lasing at higher excitation energies.

Lindy DHARMAWAN
Lindy is a sophomore majoring in Biochemistry and Cell Biology. Being a silver medalist in the International Biology Olympiad you might think that would make biology among her strongest virtue. Nope. It's her ability to annoy people in the lab with her singing while doing... well, everything. Her plans after UST include earning an MD in the States and joining the cast of The Big Bang Theory.
Words of Wisdom:
When lab work gives you lemons, it's time to reflect on your competent cells.
Winnie Wai In HUI
Winnie is a Year 2 Biology student. After entering HKUST she wanted to try anything new. That was why she joined the iGEM team to explore synthetic biology and to enjoy lab work with people from various countries. Besides enriching her knowledge, she hopes to gain precious memories and friendships through iGEM.
Food for Thought
Although there may be failures in experiments, it is really exciting to see our results come out!
Doyle Jihwan LEE
Doyle is a first year Molecular Biomedical Sciences student. He ultimately plans to work in an international organization involved in public health. He was born in South Korea, but lived his life mostly abroad in Bangladesh and Thailand.
Doyle's Two Cents on Life
Doyle sometimes feel envious toward the liver cells that he cultures. He thinks they live without stress and tension unlike the neuron cells in his brain.

Short Summary: What We Did
In this project we produced synthetic enzymes to remove red wine stains from fabric. These enzymes are designed to replace perchloroethylene (PERC), a toxic solvent used in dry cleaning that will soon be banned in France.
We listened to people who will use our product, conducting face-to-face interviews with every single dry cleaner in Paris. From this came a plan for a realistic product, a stain fighting enzymatic pretreatment compatible with existing cleaning technologies and workflows.
We isolated microbes capable of degrading red wine from a library of 186 strains taken from vineyard soil samples collected around the world with the help of our fellow iGEMers. The most effective microbes were submitted for whole genome resequencing, then analyzed to produce a short list of candidate stain-fighting enzymes.
We modeled enzymatic activity at the fabric surface and determined that activity could be substantially improved if the enzymes had a moderate binding affinity for the fabric itself. This effectively increases the enzyme concentration at the fabric surface and reduces the quantity of enzymes lost through diffusion into the medium.
We identified short peptides with affinity to cotton, linen, wool, polyester and silk using the method of phage display. The resulting Fabric Binding Domains (FBDs) were quantitatively characterized using ELISA, to determine peptides with optimal affinity as determined by our model.
We developed a high-throughput assay to quantify stain removal on real cloth. Laser-cut fabric samples are sealed to 96-well microplates and imaged on flat-bed scanners. We coded custom image analysis software to identify each circular fabric sample and measure the stain intensity.
We constructed new BioBricks , fusions of our most promising fabric binding domains to our favorite wine-degrading enzymes. The resulting proteins were expressed, purified and characterized both in vitro (in solution) and in situ (on real stained fabric).
We hope these pages convince you that our project is mature, thoroughly documented and effective. We believe that product is ready solve one small"

1.2 Scope
PolyEnzyme was originally designed to check and compare the validity of experimental data in the Barcelona 2016 iGem team project. Although the focus latter shifted to generalize the program and make it more suitable to learning and academic purposes, it is well capable of performing predictions for comparing experimental data, and of obtaining the general behavior of diverse pathways.     It is however imperative to understand the limitations of the software and the basic details of the algorithms implemented, in order to ensure the validity of the equations against the real enzymatic and genetic processes happening inside the cell. PolyEnzyme is provided **without any guarantee**, and its predictions, even when the computation is performed inside the range of validity of the equations, are only indicative of the real chemical processes underlying the pathways.
1.3 Fair use and sharing
PolyEnzyme is provided under the MIT license
https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT
2. Structure of the program
2.1 Nodes
The nodes represent the compounds in the enzymatic reactions, whether products, substrates or inhibitors. They possess a name, a concentration and can be set as sink/sources. When in this mode, the concentration is no longer set; the node can yield infinite amounts of mass when set as a source, and receive  infinite amounts of mass when set as a product. For more information about this behavior refer to the reactions section.    To start creating nodes, the user can click at a void spot inside the canvas. A prompt will then appear asking for the basic information of the node. If no information is set, the defaults (blank name and concentration = 1[mM]) will be defaulted.    Once created, the user can move the node around the canvas by clicking and dragging on its sprite. Double-clicking the node will allow for re-specifying the node's parameters.
2.2 Reactions
Reactions represent the enzymatic reactions in the pathways. A reaction links a set of substrates with a set of products, and can be inhibited by a set of inhibitors. Reactions are treated independently of the nodes, and follow Michaelis Menten kinetics.     The basic Michaelis Menten formulation is an aproximation on enzymatic reactions of the type:    $$ S + E <-> SE -> P + E $$    Where S is a substract, P is a product and E is an enzyme. The rate of the equation is modelled mathematically as:    $$ v0 = [S]Vmax/(k + [S]) $$    Where Vmax and k are constants given by the"

Alberta Genetically Engineered Machine Conference Day 1
Chris
Today, after working until early in the morning on our presentation, Emily and Himika presented what we finished to the judges and the Universities of Lethbridge and Alberta. The judges present that day were Vincent Martin (Concordia), Justin Pahara (University of Camebridge), Wayne Materi (Carbonium), Andrew Hessel (Singularity University), and Jurgen (Netherlands). Dr. Mike Ellison, Dr. H.J. Wieden, and the rest of the students present asked questions and gave feedback on the project. Later on in the day, we had time to meet with Wayne Materi and Justin Pahara who gave their impressions on the different aspects of our project and presentation which could be changed. Tomorrow, we have time scheduled to meet with various judges and other relevant people who could help us improve our project.

Introducing DIYbio What we think What others think An insider account Conclusion
The Interviews
In addition to conducting a large-scale survey to determine the public's attitude towards DIYbio, we also wanted to get an insider's point-of-view. We contacted an active member in the DIYbio community, Tito Jankowski and he graciously agreed to answer a set of interview questions we had specially prepared.
We had also prepared a survey especially for active DIYbiologists, but as of mid-October, we feel that the number of responses is still too little to make significant conclusions. So we will not be analyzing the results of that survey at this time.
However, we noted that Jason Bobe, one of the founders of DIYbio, had responded to our survey. We have selected a few of his responses to highlight here, as an unofficial interview, with his permission. Thank you Jason!
Interview with Tito Jankowski
Q. How did you get involved in DIYbio?
Tito Jankowski : I was the team leader of the Brown University iGEM Team in 2007. I loved the idea of ""applying"" synthetic biology, such as lead detecting bacteria, or trees that grow into a house. However, since I couldn't find a job in the field, I instead started taking a closer look at DIYbio. My first real work in DIYbio was starting on the Open Gel Box project.
Jason Bobe : I founded DIYbio.
Q. Which aspect of DIYbio appeals to you?
Jason : It's fun, interesting & cutting-edge.
Q. What made you think that people /the public were ready for taking biology on in the comfort of their own homes?
Tito : Recent leaps in our knowledge justify the risks. Projects such as the human genome project and iGEM make biology accessible to everyone, not just scientists in labs.
Q. Who do you think should engage in DIYBio?
(Of course we understand the idea is to make biology accessible for anyone, but what do you think is the minimum level of expertise/knowledge these people should possess?)
Tito : I think iGEM Teams are the best -- they understand that biology should be engineered. Those interested in synthetic"

The exhibition was composed of four parts: disease treatment, biopharmaceuticals, disease detection, and environmental management. Each team was responsible for one part. And teams from Sichuan University and team from the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China completed forewords and conclusion respectively. We printed the posters a week ahead of the exhibition, and laid them out in Chengdu Library one day in advance. The exhibition lasted for 7 days. On the first day, the four teams went to the library early to distribute leaflets and small gifts to the public in the rest areas and outside the library. We introduced our theme to those readers, answered their questions, had discussions with them on genetic modification, and collected suggestions from them. The audience was very absorbed, and many said they had a more objective and comprehensive understanding about genetic modification, which makes us feel very rewarding. The four teams worked on the maintenance, publicity and explanation of the exhibition for the following days, and removed the posters and cleared the exhibition hall together on the last day.
Safety Consulting
In the preliminary development of the Staphylococcus aureus QS system, we contacted the teachers of the Department of Infection of Southwest Hospital and the department of microbiology, consulting with Staphylococcus aureus pathogenicity and biosafety level, which, doctor Li from the Department of Infection introduced to us within recent years, the hospital’s infection situation. The hospital’s acquired infection is always an unavoidable problem, at the same time, professor Wang systematically introduced us with the Staphylococcus aureus biosafety level and experimental operation of the standard process, with provide an basic understanding of Staphylococcus aureus in the initiation of the project.

New application
It should be noted that this RNAi strategy against HCC, if works, is a proof of concept. Once the AND-gated system is proven to properly function as proposed here, it is nearly as flexible as the technology of RNA interference itself. Such disease-specific approach would be highly suitable in particular for diseases which are related to inflammation, which encompasses a long list of major diseases which increase in prevalence as we age (atherosclerosis, dementia, arthritis and so on)[24]. Here we give three examples: other types of cancer, Parkinson's disease and atherosclerosis.
Specifically, the promoters (“keys” to the AND gate) here can be replaced with other disease-specific promoters, in gene therapy for the corresponding diseases. And the target can be any messenger RNA. Indeed, such significance has prompted us to sign for the New Application Track in this year’s competition, rather than the Therapeutics Track we originally thought would apply.
1.Other types of cancer
AND-gated systems targeting cancer have been seen in the previous iGEM seasons, such as Bladder Cancer Sniper (SZU_China, 2015) and The Boomerang system (BGU_Israel, 2015). They all took advantage of cancer-specific promoters, including hTERT promoter discussed also in our work. While hTERT is indeed very popular among cancer researchers[1][2][3], we do have other options.
Survivin is an inhibitor of the apoptosis protein that is expressed in many human cancer cells but not in most normal adult tissues[4]. In cancer cells, the main role of Survivin is the inhibition of apoptosis. The human survivin promoter has been investigated in extensive detail. Its specificity in cancer can be explained by many features of its sequence, including a canonical CpG island, numerous Sp1 sites, CDEs (Cell-cycle Dependent Elements) and a C/G polymorphism in tumour cells[5]. Till date several researches verified the ability of the human survivin promoter to specifically target different type of cancers from tumor cells to small animal models[6][7].
Our project highlights the feasibility of utilizing promoters of certain long-non-coding RNA (lncRNA) genes as switches of cancer gene therapy.Recently there have been explosive discoveries of new lncRNAs, obtained by progress"

Secretion
At a Glance
Motivation:
Demonstrate that encapsulated bacteria could release proteins to the environment that surrounds the Peptidosomes.
Approach:
Apply the SpyTag-SpyCatcher system to secrete proteins that form complexes in the environment.
Achievements:
(I) The SpyTag-SpyCatcher system, originally developed by the 2013 team of TU-Munich was improved and adapted to secretion in Bacillus subtilis. (II) Secretion and interaction of SpyTag-SpyCatcher system was demonstrated . (III) 8 basic BioBrick  parts were improved and 8 composite parts were generated and evaluated.
Short Description
In combining Bacillus subtilis powerful secretion capacity with Peptidosomes as a new platform for functional co-cultivation we aim to produce multiprotein complexes. Various strains - each secreting distinct proteins of interest - can be cultivated in one reaction hub while being physically separated. In this part of EncaBcillus we study extracellular protein interaction mediated by the SpyTag/SpyCatcher system. This set-up bears the potential for an effective production of customizable biomaterials or enzyme complexes.
Background
Efficient and low cost production of valuable natural compounds, like proteins, has developed into a leading industry. Starting from the choice of a suitable production host to the establishment of a profitable downstream process, every step is constantly optimized to increase overall yields.
When it comes to choose the production host, Bacillus subtilis is particularly interesting: the Gram-positive model organism can be easily genetically modified and has powerful secretion capacities. [1]
In this part of EncaBcillus we aimed at making use of B. subtilis native advantages and combining them with Peptidosomes – a new innovative platform for functional co-cultivation. There is a possibility to create multiple Peptidosomes, each encapsulating one specific strain that secrets a protein of interest. By doing so, the production of multiprotein complexes could be easily achieved in one reaction hub with different subpopulations. This system is illustrated"

LAB Week 3:
Preparation of the PET plasmid towards ligation with the Gln_H gene:
This plasmid contains a strong promoter – 7T, Activated with the lactose operon mechanism, Gene resistance to ampicillin, MCs, and six amino acids His – which will be used by us as a ""glue"" for the colona and will contribute to cleaning the proteins. 
We will insert this plasmid by transformation to bacteria bl21(de3), that is a bacteria we erased the proteases, and thus its expression of proteins is stronger.
We split the plasmid .
We added phosphatase (so the plasmid will not close on itself before the insert entering).
We confirmed presence by running in electrophoresis gel.
We measured the concentration by nanadrop.
Results:
Picture 2: Electrophoresis in gel: you can see the split PET plasmid.
There are 2 bands because we ran 2 identical samples in order to increase the chances to getting the plasmid.

ATOMS-Turkiye,2015,Team:ATOMS-Turkiye#Project#Ulcer2_-_-_TEXT.html," for the clonings that we thought positive we put our bacteria to the 16 hours liquid culture and we isolated plasmid DNA with miniprep isolation method. We cutchecked our plasmid DNAs that we got from our isolation for controlling of cloning second time with using BamHI and XhoI restriction enzymes.
WESTERN BLOTTING
After we cloned our genes to pET-45b vector successfully then we did Western-Bloting for showing our proteins are synthesized with using the His-tag on the N-terminal of our proteins
SOFT AGAR PLUG ASSAY
For understanding that our proteins that produced are functional or not, we performed a chemotaxis motility assay which is called Agar Plug Assay.
We chose 2 different points on the soft agars that have 2 cm distance between them.We put the filter paper that is immersed in specially prepared liquid culture on the first point and then we put another filter paper that immersed in 0.2 mM HCL solution on the second point. Then we incubated our bacteria on 30C and examined their growing process on plates
The results are below
Increased Motility
In this section, the basic goal of the parts that we are using is to ensure that E. Coli can move from the acidic pH of the stomach fluid into the basic pH of the thick mucus layer and be able to move around within this area with ease. In this manner, the bacteria will have reached the region of the stomach where Helicobacter pylori is found. . Unlike normal fluids, the mucus layer is very thick and the flagella of natural E. Coli does not have sufficient torque or speed to allow it to enter.. In this project, we aim to give E. Coli the ability to enter the stomach’s mucus layer by increasing both of these characteristics. In order to achieve this goal, we plan to use 2 different strategies. . First, we will use a knock-out mutant form (HNS T108I) of the NHS transcription factor found in E. Coli.  This mutant form has been shown to have a positive effect on the speed and torque of the flagella. The difference between the normal NHS and mutant NHS is a single amino acid change from threonine to isoleucine at residue 108 of the protein.

As for the second strategy to reach this goal, we aim to increase the torque power and flagellar speed by replacing the MotA and MotB proteins which make up E"

Future work
1. Use SynTF(S)-PIP–SynPro(S)-PIP;4* and SynTF(S)-43-8–SynTF(S)-43-8;8* to construct a Stripe prototype and test its tri-response with EGFP coated beads.
2. Couple SynNotch module with Stripe module to construct a SwordS prototype and test its tri-response with different densities of surEGFP.
3. Test SwordS with HCC cells with different surface densities of GPC3. Currently, we have two cell lines, and our collaborators are actively searching for the third one.
4. Replace response product A and B with therapeutic factor I as IL-12, II as IL-18. Test its therapeutic effect on HCC cell lines.
The patent is being prepared.
5. We have tested a set of SynTF(S)–SynPro(S) pairs and obtained good results. Similarly, there is a set of SynTF(A)–SynPro(A) pairs, in our initial design. But, we didn’t have time to test them for this year competition. Please note our Swords uses orthogonal SynTF(S)–SynPro(S) pairs.

DhaA+P2A+HheC gene were expressed in E.coli strain MC1061. Separating supernatant and sediment of the broken cell liquid and used colorimetric method to detect the activity with TCP and 1,3-DCP.(Fig.7). DhaA+P2A+HheC in supernatant had activity of DhaA and HheC enzymes, while in sediment, there wasn't any activity.
HheC has a strict structure. Only if four HheC subunits compose together as a tetramer can it catalyze dehalogenation. Measuring the activity of HheC in chimeric protein DhaA+P2A+HheC is an ideal way to detect the effect of P2A peptide. The purified enzymes, HheC and DhaA+P2A+HheC chimeric protein was isolated by AKTA FPLC. Using substrate 1,3-DCP, HheC specific activity was 6.72(U/mg) and the chimeric protein specific activity is 5.28(U/mg). It indicated that the 2A peptide was an excellent linker to compose the two enzymes together.
Fig.6 lane7 and lane8 are blank controls, lane1 and lane3 are the expression of DhaA and HheC gene. In the lane5 and lane6, HheC and DhaA bands couldn’t be found,there is DhaA+P2A+HheC chimeric protein band, P2A peptide sequence can’t cleave DhaA and HheC. In the sediment, it is DhaA+P2A+HheC inclusion body.

Colorimetric method is a way of detecting the concentration of Cl^-(refer to protocol). The solved chimeric protein DhaA+P2A+HheC could degrade 1,3-DCP and TCP. The inclusion protein didn’t have any activity.

We believe that the problem was in the gel-extraction between ligation and transformation. Most of our plasmid was probably lost in this step. Next time we will directly use the results from the ligation reaction to transform. Although many bands were seen on the previous gel of the ligation reaction, we will check our transformation growth by single colony PCR to confirm transformation of the plasmid with our correct insert.

USTC-Software,2011,Team:USTC-Software#tech&algo_-_-_TEXT.html," the recognition of spatial relationship of agents; it is hard to pick up the agents in a DNA chain with the correct order. For example, a complex of RNA polymerase binding to trp promoter (MIT registry ID K191007) with LOVTAP on p2 can be rewritten as `\textbf{\small{DNA(up!2,bind,type$\sim$K191007p3), LOVTAP(dna!1), DNA(bind!1,type$\sim$K191007p2,down!2), RNAP(dna,rna)}}'. However, most readers, even specialists, have some difficulties to recognize and map it to the molecule it represents in a short time, making the process of model contruction laborious and error-prone.
Aiming to simplify the representation of DNA and RNA sequences, we use the hyphen character `-' to connect two adjacent BioBricks rather than through bonding between one pair of upstream and downstream sites. This is good for visualization since the structure of molecules pictured in this way can be understood eaisly by readers. As to the syntax of single BioBrick representation, there are some minor differences with Kappa language: (1) the name of each BioBrick should be the same with the identifier of that BioBrick in the MIT registry; (2) the reversed sequence of each DNA BioBrick is assumed when an asterik character `*' appears following its name; But the sites of each BioBrick are defined in the same way as Kappa Language does and those names should be different with each other indicating equivalent sites are not supported. For example, the reverse part of Lac promoter (r0010) can be represented as r0010*(), where sites in the parenthesis are not shown. It is worthy of nothing that the parenthesis cannot be omitted even for BioBricks that do not take any sites. By convention, a DNA sequence written from left to right is assumed to read from 5' end to 3' end.
As shown in the example of Lac dimer, a molecule may contain several agents as members separated by `.', by which means an agent is the basic unit of its composition. In MoDeL, the basic unit, however, has been expanded horizontally to be a sequence and different sequences, also separated by `.' in the representation, constitute molecules by forming bonds between them. The concept of sequence is not limited to DNA or RNA chains, but can be generalized to proteins and non-BioBricks in which cases each sequence may have only one agent. One example is Isopropyl beta-D-1-th"

Edinburgh_OG,2017,Team:Edinburgh OG#Model:Results_-_-_TEXT.html,", such as the extinction time of XS, as an undesirable side effect might result in a significant increase in   the selective pressure thereby raising the risk of development of the resistance to the phage in bacteria.
Figure 6. Spider diagram of the sensitivity analysis results. (A) The effect of parameter change on the XS extinction time ( c342063 ),    (B) the effect of parameter change on r-value ( 1be38af ). Only parameters with absolute elasticities over 0.01 are shown.
Based on the data from Table 2 we selected five parameters that either had significant elasticity of the extinction time or a low PCC to study their change and relationships with the output values in more details: the burst size of both phages (b, bT), induction rate (q), time latency of a temperate phage (TT) and the initial concentration of the lytic phage (P0).
The results of the sensitivity analysis of separate parameters are simulated in Figure 7. It shows that the relationship between the induction rate and the extinction time is non-linear. This result was not obvious from the PCC value in Table 2, since   the percentage change of the nominal value of 0.35 only analysed the lower end of the curve displayed in Figure 7A. The relationship between the time latency of a temperate phage and the extinction time is also non-linear and shows an obvious minimum   extremum of around 0.5 hours at which the extinction time takes the lowest value (Figure 7B). The burst size of a temperate phage is shows a more linear relationship with the extinction time compared to the burst size of a lytic phage, yet the latter   has a much larger elasticity of the r-ratio, confirming its importance in spreading the infection to other cells (Figure 7C and D). There is nearly a linear relationship between the initial concentration of the lytic particles and the extinction time   and r-value. It is worthy noting that this parameter can be easily manipulated by the experimenter, so its influence on the selective pressure has to be always taken into account.
In addition to the five pre-selected parameters, we also simulated the the variability in the time when the lytic phage is added into the system (Figure 7F). The plot shows that the extinction time is independent from the time of introduction up until   9 hours after the start of the simulation. Although this result matches the one we obtained previously (Figure 5), the pattern of the plot and unexpectedly round number suggest a numerical error during the simulation. So far we"

Nor is there correlation between the length of the run and the change in direction. The program uses a gamma distribution that fits the data collected by Berg and Brown. Several groups though, have observed that the tumble angle is not noramlly distributed but suggest that non-normality was only due to the experimental methods used e.g. in the capillary tube. Tumbling can cause a change in direction when as few as one flagella moves out of the bundle.

Personal communication with Howard Berg. 'The direction is random, more or less, but there is a slight forward bias. It varies from tumble to tumble.  The turn-angle distribution peaks at 68° rather than 90°. Tumbles turn out to be more complex than believed in 1972.  Motors switch independently, and a tumble can occur if one or just a few motors change their directions of rotation.  Tumbles are short, as judged by the tracking microscope, because they involve filament physics rather than motor physics:  a transformation in polymorphic form, following motor reversal, from normal to semi-coiled.  See  Darnton, N.C., Turner, L., Rojevsky, S. and Berg, H.C.  On torque and tumbling in swimming Escherichia coli, J. Bacteriol. 189, 1756-1764 (2007).'

Northwestern,2016,Team:Northwestern#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html," a program funded by the NSF whose stated purpose is “to build the capacity of the field to use public engagement with science (PES) activities to extend STEM learning about science, technology, and societal implications through public and scientist dialogue about synthetic biology.” The kit contained instructions and materials for a variety of activities. Of these, we decided to run a “See DNA” event and hold a “Should We Engineer the Mosquito?” forum.
Society of Women Engineers
Our “See DNA” event engaged a group of approximately 25 girls, aged 12-14, participating in a summer program held by the Society of Women Engineers (SWE). To start, we delivered a presentation about a variety of subjects related to genetics. In the remaining time, we guided the students through the isolation of visibly clumped wheat germ DNA. The most interested participants asked many unexpected questions throughout the activity, such as what we thought about GMO food and whether they could safely eat the wheat germ DNA.
Sam, Jordan, Sara, and Paul at the SWE outreach event.
Everyone displayed visible excitement when we used phrases such as “gamma radiation” and “you might die if you eat enough protease” in our answers. We concluded that in order to keep the public’s attention, it is a good idea to pause for questions frequently and to highlight the most exciting parts of the topic being presented. Overall, we provided the participants with a chance to learn about an engineering field they hadn’t encountered during their program, as well as an opportunity to experience molecular biology firsthand.
Center for Talent Development
Our “Should We Engineer the Mosquito?” forum was presented to a group of eight high school students taking an Introduction to Genetics course at Northwestern’s Center for Talent Development (CTD). First, we played a video explaining gene drives, CRISPR, and how CRISPR can be used to make an effective gene drive. We then asked the students to split into two groups, and they clearly split into a quiet group of friends and a boisterous group of friends. Both groups excitedly worked through the material, clearly demonstrating that they understood the video and found the subject matter intriguing. We asked them to fill out the Building with Biology standard exit survey, and while reviewing their submissions, we learned that the students enjoyed having a chance to debate the ethics of genetic engineering. Until our forum, their class had focused entirely on technical material. We also concluded that the Building with Biology standard survey did not exactly fit our needs, and resolved to develop our own survey going forward.
Within the week, we gave the same class a tour of two labs belonging to our"
