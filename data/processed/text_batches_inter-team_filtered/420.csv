Chassis determination
As we wanted to express modified pili in E. coli we ideally needed a chassis that did not natively produce pili. The genome of E. coli MG1655 is annotated as containing the fim operon (Accession NC_000913) and was therefore proposed to act as a positive control in all experiments. For modified pili production two strains were initially proposed: E. coli Top10 (Invitrogen) and E. coli DH5α (NEB).  Top10 is a derivative of DH10B, the genome of which (Accession CP000948) is lacking an annotated fim operon whereas there is no published genome for DH5α. Therefore it was important to verify whether these two strains were lacking the pili producing fim operon.
Using a genomic extraction and PCR we attempted to isolate and amplify three known genes of the fim operon in MG1655 and DH5α. We ran the products of these two preparations down an agarose gel. The results of the electrophoresis procedure showed the same bands in the MG1655 as in the DH5α, representative of three genes in the operon. This demonstrates DH5α's possession of the operon and therefore the unsuitability of DH5α as the chassis for our plasmid inserts.
Figure 1: This gel and the gel in Figure 2 show the genetic analysis of three strains of E. coli : MG1655, DH5α and Top10. In both cases, three known genes of the fim operon have been amplified. The wells 0-8 on this gel contain the following: hyperladder 1, DH5α FimD, MG1655 FimD, Negative control (water) FimD, DH5α FimH, MG1655 FimH, Negative FimH, DH5α FimA, MG1655 FimA, Negative FimA.

We contributed to the planning of a Synthetic Biology conference -- the Sierra Systems and SynBio Symposium -- which highlights undergraduate research in synbio. As a part of that conference, we organized an iGEM Meetup and coordinated 4 other teams attending as well as science presentations and social activities.
We started a new initiative called Wiki Flicks, where we encouraged the other iGEM teams, including ourselves, to create a short, interesting video about their project that is easy for ANYONE understand.
We have much more information, including successes and challenges, on all of these initiatives on our Practices Page.
GOLD REQUIREMENTS
Choose one of these two options: (1) Expand on your silver medal Human Practices activity by demonstrating how you have integrated the investigated issues into the design and/or execution of your project. OR (2) Demonstrate an innovative Human Practices activity that relates to your project (this typically involves educational, public engagement, and/or public perception activities; see the Human Practices Hub for information and examples of innovative activities from previous teams).
Our new initiative -- iGEM Wiki Flicks -- is an innovative and much-needed contribution to iGEM projects. The goal here is simple - to create a platform to easily, quickly, and simply explain an iGEM project so that anyone can access it and understand the projects. We have been in contact with iGEM HQ and they are very excited about the idea and want to partner in moving this forward! However, there are many limitations, including the ability of the iGEM website to host the content instead of a third-party site (like YouTube) which may be inaccessible to many teams. Our attempt this year was to garner interest (and we have several interested teams!), while the goal next year will be to formalize participation and provide infrastructure through the iGEM server to be able to host the videos for all teams. See our descriptions, 2015 participants, successes and challenges on our Practices and Wiki Flicks pages!
Help any registered iGEM team from a high-school, different track, another university, or institution in a significant way by, for example, mentoring a new team, characterizing a part, debugging a construct, modeling/simulating their system or helping validate a software/hardware solution to a synbio problem.
This year, we interacted with over 25 other iGEM teams in a variety of activities! We have documented these in detail in our Collaborations section of our wiki. Our key contributions to the research of other teams were (1) a collaboration with the University of Georgia iGEM team"

The medium labeled ""A"" was WT (JM109) or recombinant (JM109/empty vector), and the medium labeled ""B"" was recombinant (JM109/GES). The twenty persons were selected at random from our college and not informed which medium was recombinant (JM109/GES).
Fig.10 Result of questionnaire survey using WT and recombinant (JM109/GES). Out of 20 persons, two persons (10%) answered the medium A (WT) smelled stronger than the medium B (recombinant (JM109/GES)) and eighteen persons (90%) answered the medium B smelled stronger than the medium A. If we assume that both media smell equally, the probability that the medium A is selected in the questionnaire must be 0.5. From this assumption, p-value of this result was calculated using binomial test. Because the p-value was much smaller than the 5% significance level (0.0004025), the smell of recombinant (JM109/GES) is stronger than that of WT significantly. This result indicate that the recombinant (JM109/GES) synthesize geraniol.
Fig.11 Result of questionnaire survey using recombinant(JM109/Empty vector) and recombinant (JM109/GES). Out of 20 persons, five persons (25%) answered the medium A (recombinant (JM109/GES)) smelled stronger than the medium B (recombinant (JM109/GES)) and fifteen persons (75%) answered the medium B smelled stronger than the medium A. If we assume that both media smell equally, the probability that the medium A is selected in the questionnaire must be 0.5. From this assumption, p-value of this result was calculated using binomial test. Because the p-value was much smaller than the 5% significance level (0.0413900), the smell of recombinant (JM109/GES) is stronger than that of recombinant(JM109/Empty vector) significantly. This result indicate that the recombinant (JM109/GES) synthesize geraniol.

For some of us, the basics such as adjusting pH of a solution, degassing, filtering, and doing everything using sterile techniques were new lessons. But that's day one and the hard part was yet to come: protein purification.
The first time we purified protein with our advisor, it took us a solid 16 hours (it’s supposed to take 7-8 hours maximum). The first time we purified protein without any supervision a month later, the protein died at 20 percent into the procedure. The entire month of June, we got closer and closer to finishing the procedure before the protein became inactive. The next month, although we managed to speed up and get to the last step of the purification within 10 hours, the protein turned out dead at the very last step. And then finally, after three months of changing protocol, starting from scratch endless times and trying different methods, we finally acquired weak active protein. Every protein purification in August, we had active protein and each time the activity only got better. Pure bliss.
We started at square one, and even though our project is not yet completed, we have all learned to critically think when problems arise. Making media and setting up cyanobacteria cultures in incubator that once used to take us 4 hours, we learned to do that in less than an hour.

Once the forms are accomplished and accepted by the iGEM committee, the team can recieve the biobricks they want to use in their projects.
We can mutate genes related to pathogenicity and leave the genes we want to use in function. When the pathogenicity of some parts, devices or systems cannot be eliminated, we can add more control systems (e.g., on/off systems) to control those genes not performed in most conditions or let those genes only performed in less ""special"" circumstances or enviroments.
Maybe if possible, we can also create some kinds of loops to degenerate the proteins associated with the pathogenicity.

The proposed experiment involved sporulating these cells and then reanimating them on plates containing X-gal to observe if the cells maintained their genetic modification after sporulation and be able to show a colour change, much like we were aiming to do with our genetic construct.
Preliminary Results
Upon receipt of the Bacillus subtilis containing plate from Newcastle University (shown in figure 1 below), various preliminary tests were performed to find the optimum conditions for the growth of the bacteria.
Figure 1: Bacillus subtilis Containg Plate Sent From Newcastle University
The first test performed involved picking two colonies from the original plate and streaking them on plates, one containing solely LB-agar medium and one containing a LB-agar and X-gal (final concentration of 40μg/ml in agar) medium. The plates were then incubated overnight at 37°C.
Unfortunately, no photographs of the plates were taken at the time, however, both plates showed growth of white colonies. This was expected in the plate containing no X-gal however, it was expected that the other plate should have showed growth of blue-green colonies indicating that the concentration of X-gal was not sufficient enough to make the colonies change colour. Additionally, the morphology of all of the colonies did not show healthy growth, noted by “spikey” edges of each colony, which suggested that LB-agar was not the correct medium to grow Bacillus subtilis on. Because of this it was decided that in future tests that nutrient agar would be used in addition to a higher concentration of X-gal.
To confirm that the correct conditions for the growth and colour change of Bacillus subtilis had been met, a second test was performed. Six plates were set up as follows:
25ml nutrient agar, 50μl of X-gal stock solution (100mg/ml) giving a final concentration of X-gal in agar of 200μg/ml and streaked with a colony from the original plate (blue-green) that was sent from Newcastle University.
25ml nutrient agar, 50μl of X-gal stock solution (100mg/ml) giving a final concentration of X-gal in agar of 200μg/ml and streaked with a colony from the first plate of the first test (white).

Figure 1: Results from Iodine Test. Black plate contains pGFP, white plate contains B. subtilis and crystalized plate is just iodine crystals
Discussion
From the results, we can confirm that pGFP rrnB has an unfunctional amyE and hence it is unable to digest the starch, resulting in a black plate. The B. subtilis plate is white because there is a functional amyE and therefore the starch has been digested. From this experiment, we can tell that pGFP rrnB has been integrated into the correct region while there is no insert in that region in the B.subtilis plate.

Result
Integrating four models of each block, we obtained completed result about signal transduction in single cell. The result was shown as follow (Fig. 16).
Fig. 16． The result of RFP intensity under different concentration ligand Our modeling result exhibited that different concentration of ligand could result in different RFP intensity, which demonstrated that our system could response to the different signal strength specifically. And it also demonstrated that our system could work in a single cell in theory.
Yeast growth model
Purpose
After constructing the model of signal transduction in a single cell, we considered to combine single cell model with the growth of yeast to simulate our system’s practical condition. So in this part, we looked forward to construct a simple model to describe the growth of yeast cells and provided some bases to the next step.
Method
Practical data measurement
We refered the model established by Imperial College 2016. This model was used to describe the growth condition of two kinds of cell which are competitive in a limit culture.
We re-proposed some hypotheses to fit our system.
1. The condition of cell was divided into two states, activated and non-activated, and there is no conversion between two states. Each state of cell consume the nutrition independently.
2. Only the activated state could combine sweetener.
3. The nutrition in culture was limited.
4. Each group cell had same growth condition.
Then we set the ODEs as following:

Duesseldorf,2018,Team:Duesseldorf#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," with iGEM TU Delft who introduced our postcard project on their Eurasian meetup in Shenzhen, China. A lot of iGEM teams brought their postcards to the meet up.
The first postcards arrived on July 18 from iGEM Taipei, Taiwan. From then on, every day we eagerly waited for the mail to arrive and were often rewarded with packages containing new, beautiful postcards from all over the world.  One time we had to go all the way to the custom service since one team forgot to declare their content. Another time we received an empty package without any postcards! Unfortunately the postcards had fallen out during shipment or delivery. But luckily (!!!) the team had some postcards left which they were able to send to us - and finally they arrived.
After we had received postcards from (almost) every team, we started sorting them, glueing addresses on them and putting them into packages. Each participating team received one stack of postcards from other teams and another stack of various postcards with the addresses of the other teams.
Afterwards each team’s postcards were exchanged with other iGEM-teams so that every team  received postcards from all over the world. The postcards were then shared with people in the neighborhood, during public events etc.
Have a look!

The p70-34-sfGFP-Terminator sensor containing lldRO1-J23117-lldRO2 promoter (BBa_K1847008) with a strong RBS and the p62-34-sfGFP-Terminator sensor containing the natural promoter with a strong RBS, had relatively high basal expression, about 7 times higher than RIOT sensor 10. In addition, they did not show significant difference in the level GFP intensity when lactate concentration increased from 10-2 M to  M. Although RIOT sensor 11, p62-33-sfGFP-Terminator (BBa_K1897029) had low basal expression, it did not respond well to the increase in lactate concentration.
In general, RIOT sensor 10 not only had the lowest basal expression but also showed significant fold change in GFP intensity, which is about 2 times higher when lactate concentration increased from 10-2 M to 10-3 M.
Figure 1: Comparisons of sensitivity to changes in lactate concentration among RIOT sensors and other lactate sensors.
Overnight cultures of bacteria transformed with different sensors were diluted and incubated with various lactate concentration including 0 M, 10-3 M and 10-2 M. The best sensor is expected to have low basal expression to minimize false positive results while exhibiting sensitivity to small changes in lactate concentration.
RIOT sensor 10: p70-33-sfGFP-Terminator (BBa_K1897028) contains lldRO1-J23117-lldRO2 promoter (BBa_K1847008) with a weak RBS (BBa_B0033)

iGEM Team attributions page
Each team must clearly attribute work done by the student team members on this page.  The team must distinguish work done by the students from work done by others, including the host labs, advisors, instructors, and individuals not on the team roster.
Why do we have this requirement?
Attribution Template
We have this requirement to help the judges know what you did yourselves and what you had help with. We don't mind if you get help with difficult or complex techniques, just be sure to report the work your team did and the work that was done by others.
For example, you might choose to work with an animal model during your project. Working with animals requires getting a license and applying far in advance to conduct certain experiments in many countries. This is something that is difficult to achieve during the course of a summer, but much easier if you can work with a postdoc or PI who has the right licenses.
A great example of complete attribution comes from the Imperial College London 2011 team (scroll down to the bottom of their team page to see attributions).
Here are some of the fields we recommend you have on this page. If there are other areas not listed below, but applicable to your team/project, please feel free to also list them on your attributions page. Please feel free to remove any areas not applicable to your project.

(J)
The volume of oil between two droplets can be expressed as \(V_{sp} = (Q_1 + Q_2) \varDelta t = l_{init} H W_1 = l H W_{ch}\). Solving the eq.(J) for Δt and inserting it into the volume relation, we get the expression for l, which represents the initial thickness of oil in the coalescence chamber (with dimensions HWch):
(K)
Replacing T0 in eq. (F) with eq. (K), the full expression for drainage-film thickness is found:
(L)
The approximate solution of equation (2) is the following:
(3)
The drainage rate of the oil is expressed according to Barman et al. (See ESI of [1]):
(4)
When the expressions (1) and (3) are inserted, the equation (4) gives a function of drainage flow rate .
2. Interfacial tension and electrowetting-effect
The pressure difference in equation (1) and the expression for Qdrain accounts for the effects of surfactant adsorption and capillary pressure. However in our experiments we have the two populations of droplets with different interfacial tension γ. The difference of interfacial tension arises from different degrees of interface saturation of surfactant between re-injected and produced droplets. The re-injected droplets are incubated beforehand and already have saturated amount of surfactants on their surface. In comparison, the produced droplets only reach the saturation at a later point. All the droplets in our experiments are being produced by using nonionic surfactants.
The first population of droplets is being re-injected into the electrocoalescence chip after some incubation period. Liquid interface of these droplets gets saturated with surfactant monomers from oil solution. It is well known the interfacial tension of droplets reach the lowest (equilibrium) value γeq[3] after incubation. We use the value γ1=γeq for interfacial tension of re-injected droplets. This population of droplets is produced in a microfluidic chip of lower channel height, therefore the volume of droplets is smaller compared to that of the second population droplets. When the first population is re-injected into the coalescence chip with higher channel height compared to the channel height they were"

Software tools for iGEMers : BioBrick/Project Search & Tutorials
When you first decided to take part in iGEM, you might have spent a lot of time on things such as learning about BioBricks and how to use them, searching a vast library of past projects, and looking for relevant parts.
These difficulties are common, so you are not alone among beginners to stumble upon them, halting the progression of determinig your team project.
However, there are presently only a few tools which help beginners from spending too much time.
Most software made by past teams target Synthetic biologists, those already farmiliar with iGEM to some extent, and are only available after long steps -- downloading, decompressing, and installing.
So, we decided to create a set of tools helpful to beginners.
If common obstacles can be removed, you can spend more time thinking about your project.
We have created two types of software : the Tutorial and the Searching System.
The Tutorial helps you understand concepts that beginners frequently stumble on, and what BioBricks and Genetic Networks are.
We have gamified the totorial, making it enjoyable to read.
The Searching System saves your time searching past projects and BioBrick parts.
You can easily access the information you really want.
Detailed descriptions are on individual project pages.

TUDelft,2017,Team:TUDelft#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," periplasm. To achieve this we placed a TorA export tag in front of the protein and this fusion protein was transformed into the KEIO and WT strain, see overview Figure 41. Widefield microscope images were made to visualize whether the addition of the transport tag impaired the GFP structure and therefore its fluorescence. Additionally, an osmo-shock was performed to harvest the periplasmic fraction of the cell. After that, the plate-reader was used to determine the GFP levels in the periplasm and cytoplasm. This will tell us whether the the construct is functional thereby translocating the GFP into the periplasm.
Figure 41: Scheme of translocation. Scheme of plasmids and strains used in characterization of TorA-GFP.
We modeled the dynamics of the system to know at what time the concentration of GFP in the periplasm is maximal. For this modeling, we needed to know the OD curve of both the WT and KEIO strain. Due to the fact that we did not know the effect of TorA-GFP on the growth rate, we transformed the plasmid into the strains and measured the OD in the plate-reader. The experiment was performed with the growth rate protocol . In Figure 42, it is shown that the maximal OD is lower for the KEIO strain compared to the WT strain. Also, the growth rate of the KEIO strain in its exponential phase was smaller. With modeling we determined the maximal growth rate to be 1.4 per hour for WT and 0.9 per hour for KEIO.
Figure 42: OD curves. Measured OD curves of the (a) WT and (b) KEIO strain with TorA-GFP, measured in the plate-reader. The OD600 is put against time (hours).
To verify whether the addition of TorA tag to GFP did not impair the functionality of GFP, widefield images were taken with the widefield protocol . As shown in Figure 43, GFP fluorescence was both observed in the KEIO and WT strain. Consequently, It is shown that more GFP is present in WT. Furthermore, you can see that the shape of the KEIO strain cells is elongated. This is probably caused by the deletion of TolA, which destabilizes the membrane ( Baker et al. 2014 ).

For GFP to be able to be transported into vesicles, it needs to be present in the periplasm. Therefore, an osmoshock was"

This year we constructed 15 basic Parts, including:
The core elements used in our project,TRPC5 collection and R-GECO;
Eukaryotic regulation system, TetOn system;
Antibiotics-resistant genes used for selection during our cell experiments;
Coding sequence of mutated sfGFP.
Actually, compared with the number of BioBricks that can be used in bacteria, few Parts is able to be applied in eukaryotic cells. Our project used mammalian cell line to express our core protein, the sound-sensitive channel, TRPC5, and calcium indicator, R-GECO. In addition, our antibiotics Parts and TetOn system are commonly used in cell experiments for selection and regulation.

Paris_Bettencourt,2015,Team:Paris Bettencourt#Project#Continuity_-_-_TEXT.html," The battle against contaminants is now a fair fight. The only difference is that they express a gene allowing for their identification, that we will further refer to as the ID gene.
Before distribution, the differentiation is induced and the cells start to produce vitamins in high quantity. They lose the ID gene in the process.
Our model for decreasing the fitness burden of our organism during the production phase. The cells do not produce any vitamin during the manufacturing process. The vitamin production is triggered before the distribution.
We protected our product against foreign organisms, but one threat remains: our organism's own mutants. If a mutation occurs in the active site of an enzyme, or in the promoter of an operon, the functionality of the organism might be impaired. How can we prevent our organism from mutating?
Fortunately, our friends at the Vanderbilt University iGEM team worked precisely on that problem this summer. We worked hand in hand with them to see what a real-life application of their invention would mean practically. They invented an algorithm to scan the sequences looking for regions that are likely to mutate, and proposed alternative versions of our sequences.
As they worked on this project while we were working on ours, we obviously could not use their optimized sequences for our constructs. However, we relied on gene synthesis for a lot of parts, so it would not have been a problem to use the optimized sequences instead. Their algorithm is therefore a valuable tool for any synthetic biologist willing to create durable products, and we applaud their work.
The ID gene
The quality control of our system is possible thanks to an ID gene, which consists of the fluorescent protein mCherry expressed at low levels. We chose this protein because its fluorescence colour is easily distinguishable from the media that will be used for growth, hence a better signal.
The aim of this gene is to provide a quick and reliable way to determine whether the strain that will be distributed is the one intended. After growing the micro-organism in a bioreactor, a sample is taken in order to start a new culture from it. We suggest that, while doing so, the sample has to pass a quality check where its fluorescence is measured.
If the sample displays fluorescence, the culture is sent for packaging and a new culture can be launched. If the fluorescence in not sufficient, the sample is discarded and a new blister stock of the original strain is used to start the culture.
This fluorescence measurement is a good example of real-life use for the DIλ spectrophotometer, a low-budget device that is developed by our neighbours at the Openlab. Heavy development is currently ongoing to make it capable of fluorescence measurements.

Jeffrey Pea
Major and Year:
Microbiology and Immunology (2nd Year)
Why iGEM:
Having just joined this year, I heard about iGEM throughout my first year but was not exactly sure what it was. However, after going to several introductory meetings I was immediately hooked by passionate and knowledgeable everyone was on the team. The realm of synthetic biology seemed truly fascinating, for it was a field I wasn't very familiar with and yet very curious about. Soon, I began to realize that iGEM provided an outlet for me to be exploratory and innovative in research, using the fundamental knowledge I learned previously and implementing them in novel experiments. The combination of being able to apply my learning in a laboratory setting, being able to learn more advanced techniques related my background, and being able to immerse myself in an exponentially growing field that is synthetic biology is the main reasoning for joining the iGEM team.
Hopes to gain from iGEM:
By being a part of iGEM, I hope to become a more well-rounded scientist and researcher. My goal is to become more knowledgeable in the field of synthetic biology, whether"

Conclusion
    In this summer, we have built a new awareness about metabolic engineering and fermentation, which reminds us of the drawbacks of our project design and experiment. Overall, if we desire to introduce our project to industrial production, we have to solve all the problems listed above. Recently, we have optimized the carbon source in our fermentation medium by replacing glucose with glycerol, and we also have made a model to analyse how different carbon source, nitrogen source and inorganic salt in culture medium can affect the production of PHB as well as other metabolic pathways. But that is not enough, what we need to do in the future is to accomplish the whole project and optimize the chassis, light devices, culture medium and flexibility of the whole project.

Abstract
Message in a Bubble: a robust inter-cellular communication system based on outer membrane vesicles. Sending a message across the ocean… Outer membrane vesicles (OMV), naturally produced by gram negative bacteria such as E. Coli, are strong candidates for long-distance messaging. Our engineered communication platform consists in controlling OMV production by destabilizing membrane integrity through over-expression of specific periplasmic proteins (e.g. TolR). In order to control and modulate message content, we used fusions with OmpA signal sequence and the ClyA hemolysin as delivery tags. A targeting system was developed, based on the outer-membrane expression of Jun/Fos leucine zippers to control the vesicle flux between donor and recipient cells. Once received, the signal from incoming vesicles is transduced through a modified Fec pathway, whereby the receptor is provided by the OMV. Computational models provided insight to all of the above steps. Such reliable communications systems have wide biotechnological implications, ranging from targeted drugs delivery and detoxification to advanced division of labor or even cell-based computing.
Strategy
We aimed developing a long distance communication system between gram-negative bacteria that is based on the ability of these organisms to produce Outer-Membrane Vesicles (OMVs). We designed a framework which can be easily expanded to a"

“We pride ourselves in how we in our environmental standards. We really take our approach to health, safety and the environment seriously.” -Michal from Kinross
In mining operations, water is very important, as it is used in the grinding and leaching processes. During mining operations, Kinross implements a water strategy, which is a comprehensive program aimed at proactively addressing water issues and opportunities and aims to recycle their water at a better quality than when it was extracted.
“No waterless extraction methods available to us, all operations use water.” -Michal from Kinross
“We actively look at reducing all sorts of contaminants in water. Our policy is to discharge water better than the condition we found the water at.” -Michal from Kinross
Working with Kinross promotes the safe and environmentally conscious behaviour all mining industries should have. The recycling of water is financially expensive, time-consuming, and energy expensive. Our project aims to eliminate these inefficiencies and provide mining site communities and the people that live there with usable water. Thus, producing a tool that could be used for the promotion of eco-friendly industrialization.
“What you guys are aiming for is innovation, is visionary, and...Kinross can supply you with information necessary.” -Michal from Kinross
Waste Water Treatment Plant (WWTP) - Removal of Harmful Substances from Wastewater
Ashbridges Bay and North Toronto Treatment Plants expressed their concerns for microplastics and pharmaceuticals. Safe and effective treatment of wastewater is important for sustaining the health and well-being of Toronto citizens and the environment. Current and future wastewater treatment is put under regulations imposed by the provincial and federal government to ensure the environment and public health is preserved. Our work aims to promote these standards and eliminate harms that threaten public health and the environment.
“80% of wastewater is released into the environment without adequate treatment” -WASTEWATER: The Untapped Resource. (2017). S.l.: United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization.
The need for a more efficient, cost-effective wastewater treatment method is essential for the environment, the global community and the progression of innovative technology in the industrial field.

NEFU_China,2015,Team:NEFU China#Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," reliable yogurt guarder is indeed necessary.
 
Visiting a dairy factory
Yogurt is popular to millions of people all over the world. It can benefit people mainly due to the ""live"" bacteria that are good for intestinal health. In order to maintain the nutritive components and original taste, raw milk should be treated by pasteurization during yogurt production to kill most pathogens. Unlike sterilization, the relatively low temperature (up to 80 °C) used in pasteurization may allow a very small amount of pathogenic bacteria to survive this treatment.
Since we were working on a project related to the fermentation and quality inspection process of yogurt, we already explored very much relevant knowledge. We were becoming increasingly clear to the gap between theory and actual practice. So we visited a dairy factory in order to know more about yogurt production.
During this visit, a guide showed us around the workplace and informed us the procedure of actual yogurt production. It was the first time for us to see the huge production equipment in person! Then, to achieve the primary goal of this visit, we consulted with a quality control inspector to learn about the main pathogens in yogurt and the current inspection procedure. We learned that a cup of eatable yogurt may contain certain amount of coliform bacteria, but must not have other common pathogens such as Salmonella or Bacillus. We also learned that coliform bacteria are the most common pathogens in yogurt. So in our subsequent experiments, we chose E. coli to validate the function of our device. Moreover, quality control inspectors utilized plate count to detect coliform bacteria in yogurt. Later on, we applied this method to our tests for the quality of yogurt under different storage conditions in our own experiments. Last but not least, we realized that the conventional detecting methods cannot be easily used in our daily life due to the complicated steps and demands of facilities. 
This visit had a great influence on us. We realized the urgent need for a handy method of detecting pathogens in yogurt and this promoted us to proceed with confidence. Certainly, we knew we still had a long way to go.

Tuebingen,2018,Team:Tuebingen#Demonstrate_-_-_TEXT.html,"Draft of the sythesis of the azide-donor.
After executing the second reaction step the analytic results indicated that no reaction took place. Mass spectroscopy data suggested that after the reaction both reactants were still present in their original form as well as cleavage products of the 2,2'-Dithiodiethylamine. During troubleshooting, we hypothesized that changing the conditions of the reaction would lead to a positive outcome. We considered possible changes could be the reaction time and -temperature. The reaction time might have been too short or the activation energy of the transitional state was too high. A possible solution for the first problem could be to increase the reaction time. For the second problem, it would be possible to increase the reaction temperature. But with the already unstable 2,2'-Dithiodiethylamine, this might just destroy the reactants. A catalysator would be another option to decrease the activation energy. We also considered taking a whole different approach. Because of the alkene as a by-product, the yield was always very small. If the alkene was chosen as the product, targeting it with an S-Nucleophile, the yield could be improved. Plus, the disulfide binding could be produced simply by using a molecule with a disulfide binding. Due to a shortage of time, we were unable to test our possible solutions.
Reactionstep two: the reaction was not successful
We tried to reobtain the reactants, but the Thio-Eslicarbazepine is not stable in water. The thiol group tends to decay, forming the alkene. As the solvent for the second reaction step was a water- THF-mixture, the Thio-Eslicarbazepine couldn't be reextracted in a sufficient amount. As a result we weren't able to test the Thio-Eslicarbazepine on our neuron-like cells to see if it's still preventing the sodium from entering, which would leave them less excitable. This would indicate that the changed Eslicarbazepine-SS-N3 is still an active Na+-blocker.
Bioinformatics
Our bioinformatics group successfully generated a structure of BoNTC using homology modeling. Moreover, we developed BERT, a powerful deimmunization workflow which we not only applied very successfully to the BoNTC binding domain, but also in an extensive collaboration with iGEM Paris-Bettencourt on a  ovispirin/l-fucose Mutarotase fusion protein.

Previously we showed how we design the whole system, now we are going to tell you how we                             achieve them steps by steps:
Regulator
To increase the accumulation of endogenous ROS in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and                             to improve the tolerance of yeast to high levels of ROS, we optimized our yeast, which will                             be shown as follow:
Increase the accumulation of endogenous ROS
Overview:
After literature searching, we selected two genes, yno1 and ndi1, as candidates                         for overexpression to increase the accumulation of endogenous ROS. According to our data, both                         of these two genes can effectively increase the accumulation of endogenous ROS.
To determine whether overexpression of ndi1 or yno1 can increase the endogenous                         ROS accumulation in yeast, we constructed an expression plasmid, based on pESC-Leu, in which                         the cloned ndi1 or yno1 is driven by GAL1 promoter. Thus the target gene can be                         induced by galactose and repressed by glucose.
Fig. 1,2 Transformed the plasmid into yeast
After transformed the plasmid into Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we first measured the ROS                         production of yeast cells cultured in non-screening or screening media by Fluorescent                         microplate reader. We mixed yeast cells with DCFH-DA, which can be oxidized by ROS to become a                         strong green fluorescent substance DCF (dichlorofluorescein) that cannot penetrate the cell                         membrane.
Fig. 3,4 results of ROS accumulation through overexpress yno1 or ndi1
Fluorescent microplate reader analysis showed that overexpression of either ndi1 or yno1 may cause significant ROS production as revealed by green fluorescent substance DCF, and the                         fluorescence intensity in ndi1-overexpressing"

As our brother team, we share the same culture and history background with Fudan . This year, it’s the second time we go to Giant Jamboree together. Familiar with each other, we frequently communicate our experiment process, giving a helping hand while one facing difficulties. Plasmid backbone psb1c3, DH5α, interlab… Whenever they are in need, we are by their side. Also, they shared experience in cell culture and lent machines such as fluorescent microscope to us.
Jilin_China
We first got acquaintance with Jilin_China in Nankai Conference and kept contact with each other afterwards. To ensure the repeatability of our data, we sent C-terminal and N-terminal of ECFP to them, requesting them to test whether we have split the protein right. Meanwhile Jilin_China works on RNA thermosenser this year and they need to test the expression of sfGFP in different temperature, indicating in what condition the designated thermosensor is open. We gave a helping hand by examing wheather their positive control will change with different temperatures.
Figure 1. Fluorescence expression of positive control at different temperatures. The figure’s horizontal axis represents the temperature range (28℃ to 42℃), and the vertical axis represents fluorescence intensity of sfGFP. The red line is the sfGFP expression curve of NPC at 8th hours, the purple line is sfGFP expression curve of NPC at 6th hours"

10/15/13
We ran a gel for the colony PCR products we started last night and colony 5 showed a bright band right around 1100 bp's which is the right size for DspB. We then started a 5 ml overnight in LB-Amp from its corresponding streak on the plate.
10/16/13
We ran plasmid purification on our DspB Colony E from the O/N we started yesterday. We then transformed the plasmid into BL21, which is the E. coli strain that we use for expression and purification. The transformation product was plated on LB+AMP and left in the 37° incubator overnight. All procedures were performed according to the protocols listed on our protocols page.
We also made 500 mL of LB in preparation for growing up our BL21 with DspB. The plasmid specific antibiotic, AMP, will be added tomorrow after the LB is autoclaved and ready for use.
10/17/13
We started a 5 mL overnight of our DspB in BL21 from the plate on 10/16. We also added the AMP to our autoclaved LB. Now we just have to finish waiting for our BL21 to grow up.
10/18/13
We inoculated 500 mL LB+AMP with the 5 mL overnight from yesterday and allowed it to grow for three hours from 4 am to 7 am. At 7 am we added 500 uL IPTG to induce expression of our protein and continued to grow it for another five hours"

1. How warriors kill enemies:
    AHL1 in warrior I excretes AHL1. AHL1 goes into its enemies and forms a complex with the protein AHL1R. This complex activates the promoter Pahl1, thus activating the expression of LacI. The expression of LacI inhibits the promoter Plac, thus inhibiting the expression of cmR. Because we culture our E. coli in medium containing chloramphenicol, warrior I kills its enemies. As AHL1 cannot activate Pahl2 via AHL2R inside E. coli from warrior I’s group, we fulfill our desire that warrior I just kill the enemies but not bacteria from it own group. Warrior II works in a similar way.
2. How farmers provide nutrients:
    RafD encodes invertase, which can hydrolyze sucrose into glucose and fructose. The signal peptide of HlyA ligated to RafD can help the invertase be secreted through the recognition of its signal sequence. This is our new part. Besides, by combining extrinsic HlyB, HlyD with intrinsic TolC from the nucleoid in E. coli, we form the transporter which helps the invertase to be secreted.
    This whole part is designed to produce a secretory invertase. As our E. coli can use glucose but not sucrose as its carbon source, farmers fulfill the role of providing nutrients.
    However, from our Orthogonality"

Enzyme cutting site protection
To avoid deconstruction of enzyme cutting site and therefore incapability during substitution of the base, Synoproteiner succeeds in exchanging 14 kinds of commonly used cutting sites such as EcoRI, XbaI and so on.
Users can multi-select the enzyme cutting site that they want to stay unaltered and hence get an optimized sequence without changing selected region.
Method of prediction
In recent years, many researchers have made great efforts to explore the determinants of the folding rate, and various forecasting methods have been proposed. The existed prediction methods can be roughly divided into three categories.11-12 The first one is based on the tertiary structure.13-19 However, it takes lots of molecular experiments, expensive and in long period, to acquire the information of the tertiary structure, which fails to meet the demand of rapid prediction. The second category is based on the secondary structure.20-24 This kind of method requires information of the secondary structure, similarly obtained by molecular experiments, or from the primary sequences prediction, but it will be limited by accuracy of the secondary structure prediction method. The last one is based on the primary structure,25-34 which predicts the folding rate from amino acid sequences without most structure information.4 And our prediction of the protein folding rate focuses on the last method.
Algorithm
Part I—Optimization
Basic Table
Based on the synonymous codons table, we calculate, we calculate function of single codon, function of codon pair  and the function of multi-objective codon optimization. The method aims at make the optimization of whole best by calculating the relative effect of single codon and codon pair.

Fitness function：
In the function,
cpi is a value larger than zero, ranging from 10-4 to 0.5,fitcp (g) is the fitness function of the codon pair，fitsc (g) is the fitness function of the single codon，w ( (c (k),c (k+1)) is the weight of codon pairs in sequences g,|g| is the length of encoding sequences, c (k) is k-th codon in the sequences,

Bielefeld-Germany,2011,Team:Bielefeld-Germany#Project#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," The background and the state of the art of each subproject is described below this figure . To have a quick insight of what is happining in our lab take a look in our labjournal .
Figure 1: Overview of the projectidea of iGEM team Bielefeld 2011. Bisphenol A (BPA) is reduced by the electrons from NADH transferred by the ferredoxin-NADP+ oxidoreductase (FNR), ferredoxin (Fd) and cytochrome P450 (CYP) which are fused to a S-layer protein. The molecular beacon (hairpin structure) binds two short DNA oligos. The NAD+-dependent ligase (LigA), which is also fused to a S-layer protein, ligates the two oligos so that the hairpin structure opens up and the fluorophore is able to emit light after excitation.
S-layer
S-layers (crystalline bacterial surface layer) are crystal-like layers consisting of multiple protein monomers and can be found in various (archae-)bacteria. They constitute the outermost part of the cell wall. Especially their ability for self-assembly into distinct geometries is of scientific interest. At phase boundaries, in solutions and on a variety of surfaces they form different lattice structures. The geometry and arrangement is determined by the C-terminal self assembly-domain, which is specific for each S-layer protein. The most common lattice geometries are oblique, square and hexagonal. By modifying the characteristics of the S-layer through combination with functional groups and protein domains as well as their defined position and orientation to each other (determined by the S-layer geometry) it is possible to realize various practical applications ( Sleytr et al., 2007 ). The usability of such well defined nano-lattice structures is far-reaching from ultrafiltration membranes to the development of immobilized biosensors.
Especially for the production of cell-free biosensors, functional fusion proteins are of great importance. Kainz et al. (2010) fused fluorescent proteins with an S-layer glycoprotein from Geobacillus stearothermophilus . They demonstrated that the properties of the fusion protein were similar to the native fluorescent protein. The intensity of the fluorescence, the lifetime and the adsorption spectra showed comparable behavior at different pH-values. Enzymes fused to immobilized S-layers showed a significantly longer durability and were more stable against physical and chemical treatment.( Schäffer et al., 2007 , Tschiggerl et al., 2008 ).

Background of Application
According to the 2017 report of the International Diabetes Federation, there are 425 million                         people with diabetes in the world; in China, the number of people with diabetes is about 110                         million, and the number of people with hypertension is about 230 million. The patient population                         is extremely large. This type of population is the main patient group of hidden chronic kidney                         disease. If chronic kidney disease cannot be detected and treated early, it may eventually lead                         to uremia, with a mortality rate of up to 90%, and timely early diagnosis may bring about 70%                         reversal rate. Therefore, early screening for chronic kidney disease in patients with diabetes                         and hypertension is of great significance.
The incidence of chronic kidney disease can be divided into five stages. The symptoms of patients in stage I and stage II are not obvious. By the third stage, the patient showed more obvious symptoms, and at this time, the kidneys had suffered more serious damage. Due to the concealment of chronic kidney disease in the first and second stages, many patients cannot go to the hospital for medical examination in time. When the patients with chronic kidney disease have reached the third stage of chronic kidney disease, the treatment effect will be far less than the first and second stages. In addition, going to the hospital for physical examination is also inconvenient, which also makes some patients unable to consciously go to the hospital for physical examination. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a portable tool for early detection of chronic kidney disease, to help potential patients with chronic kidney disease such as diabetes and hypertension to detect their physical condition at home in real time, and to provide early warning for the development of the first and second stages of chronic kidney disease.
Principle of Design
We selected β2-microglobulin (β2-MG) as an indicator of early detection of                         chronic kidney disease, because β2-MG has an abnormally elevated concentration in the                         first and second stages of development of chronic kidney disease (for detailed information of                         β2-MG please refer to our project section). We designed a visualized liquid crystal                         urine protein detector Dr. Familict whose detection principle is based on our liquid crystal                         detection experiment. In Dr. Familict, the liquid crystals are vertically aligned under the                         action of the DMOAP inducer, and the polarized light incident on the polarizing plate thereon                         passes through the liquid crystal to make the image inside the box black; when there is an                         excessive amount of β2-M"

We are invited to test the front end of the project of the team HFUT-China for finding bugs and fix them. We found four bugs and design flaws.
1. When we clicked the button on the 'project' page to expand the gene chain list and delete designated gene chain, it might occasionally fail to delete although a notice of successful deletion is displayed. We discovered that it was caused by transaction locks of the database, which led to a failed concurrent Ajax request. This failure cannot be detected by the program, which would not stop the front end popping a successful notice.
2. The dragging-up of the recommending gene chain in the 'design' page might fail occasionally and the dragging function collapsed meanwhile until we refreshed it. It was diagnosed that problems were gestated in the interaction between the action scopes of AngularJS and NG-sortable database. We fixed it once after the bug was detected.
3. We found that there was not a clear button for registration, which made it difficult for users to register. It might affect the user experience.
4. Expanding the relationship network in the 'gene relationship' page may lead to the overlapping of the balls of surrounding genes.
We spent days on fixing bugs above and succeeded eventually. This experience contributed much on strengthening the bond between the team HFUT-China and us.
USTC
The procedure of the team USTC involved processing images of fluorescent cells. However, it required distinguishing the part of fluorescent cells from those non-fluorescent ones and the background as the pretreatment.
We calculated the distribution of the greyscale of images. Based on the distribution, we can determine which pixels may belong to fluorescent cells and which pixels may not.
Therefore we are able to cut out the part of fluorescent cells from remainders, which helped the team USTC solve this little tiresome problem.
SJTU-Software
We accepted the invitation from the team SJTU-Software to fill out their questionnaires. They told us that our opinions and advices on their project really mattered, which we were truly glad to see.

Amsterdam,2015,Team:Amsterdam#Human practices#Collaboration_-_-_TEXT.html," in. By using their biobricks that enable rapid immobilization of organisms via nanowires, together with the ability to accurately print these in the form of biofilms, one could create coatings that would be easy to produce and ideally suited for bio-composite leaves. A coating of cyanobacteria could simply be printed on a piece of porous paper and placed in the gas-phase of a photobioreactor for a steady supply of CO2, where it would function much in the way as described by Bernal et al. [2014]. Further leveraging Amsterdam’s consortium design, a layer of cyanobacteria would be printed on top of a layer of chemotrophic cell-factories like E. coli, who would use the constant supply of carbon provided by the cyanobacteria to produce end-products like biofuels, which would be transported to an extraction chamber where the product would be isolated.
Previous method based on extrusive coating method described by Bernal et al. (2014). .
Together, the work of team Amsterdam and TU Delft shows how combining separate iGEM projects can unlock new solutions to existing problems that could lead to new innovations. Indeed, the sustainable product formation enabled by Amsterdam’s consortium and the ease of printing biofilms with immobilizing nanowires developed by TU Delft could turn the type of biocomposite devices described by Bernal et al. into the cheap, versatile biofactory of the future."

- That is our secret…
- I would be happy to use that secret to help ease the fight for my patients.
We exposed the idea in every way possible: social networks, in the center of the business district, at the “Science Night” event, targeted interviews, by using the local and national media. We built a marketing layout and explanation in school and therefore we also held the convention with the classes of excellence. During the conference a philosophical discussion was held and dealt with genetic modification.
We conducted an opinion poll for the locals and for the other teams competing in IGEM.
We hope that, with the variety of activities described in this section we were able to change the concepts of the common citizen.
Science in the media - it is all a matter of perspective
We turned to the media to spread the research area we are dealing with. Our turning to the media was done in order to raise attention and attempt to clarify a modern standpoint in the area of molecular genetics. It was important for us to read posts from the public in order to understand their position about the ability to change the ability of taste in the mouth. We received positive feedback and very very interesting posts.
“What a brilliant idea! It doesn’t hurt and it works!! I am ready to be first in line. I have got the will power against chocolate”. (Galit)
“I come from a family who suffers from diabetes. If it is possible to prevent our descendants from the suffering, it is worth a try”. (Shira)
“I have been suffering from high blood pressure for 10 years, I wish I could bring back the lost time”. (Dubi)
“I would really love to but I’m afraid. Crispers? Sounds like a magic word…It is as if everything is possible here?” (Shulman)
We have no doubt in our minds that most of citizens in Israel know about the iGEM competition and surely our area of research. A lot is due to the exposure through media.

Our Labspace
Our main achievement in the wet lab has been the creation of a new composite BioBrick, engineering E. coli to produce GFP in response to Nitrates. Not only is this part complete, but it's also well characterised both on its own and working in tandem with a second BioBrick.
We also developed a way of encapsulating our bacteria, allowing an easy and safe method of spreading them in the environment, and also dramatically improving signal detection and E. coli survival in soil.
Finally we worked to further characterise the PyeaR promoter submitted by Edinburgh in 2009, improving the quality of information available in the parts registry.
In this section you can find out more details on all our achievements. You can also find information about about the design of our parts, including all the decisions we made and why, as well as all the information relating to their construction and characterisation. It also contains material on our new encapsulation methods, and finally lists all our safety considerations both in the lab and on a wider environmental scale.

Digital  Display:
Today  was a TERRIBLE day for experiments. After restriction analysis, all bands  seemed to be correct, which cheered up everyone. However, another gel for  ligation was abysmal. Six bands were observed after double digestion! Maybe  enzyme was contaminated or added wrongly. Only thing we could do was to start  all over again.
Cell  Immobilization:

★  ALERT!
This page is used by the judges to evaluate your team for the basic part special prize .
A basic part is a functional unit of DNA that cannot be subdivided into smaller component parts. BBa_R0051 is an example of a basic part, a promoter regulated by lambda cl.
Most genetically-encoded functions have not yet been converted to BioBrick parts. Thus, there are many opportunities to find new, cool, and important genetically encoded functions, and refine and convert the DNA encoding these functions into BioBrick standard biological parts.
Note
This page should list all the basic parts your team has made during your project. You must add all characterization information for your parts on the Registry. You should not put characterization information on this page."

March 8th.
Whole Team Meeting, Discussing the near Future with Assaf and Shai (Mentors).
Meeting summary:
- We couldn’t find the sequnce of TCDD degradation enzymes  that we found in the literture.
- Shai (Metnor) said that we should contact labs that already showed lever cells that degrade any kind of dioxin and see if they can give us the specific enzymes that were part of the degradation.
- Do the same thing as above with the recombinant E.coli (from one of lior`s articles) (when we ask this kind of things we should ask for everything, the Ecoli and all the plasmids with the enzymes and the DNA sequences and start checking how much time and money it would take to express them ourselves) we should ask if they tried TCDD as well.
- We should check references of the article with 3 enzymes in other articles and see what others had to say about it.
- We should summaries all the candidates for degradation, what kind of reactions we know they do and think how we can check the products of TCDD degradation by them. What the intake and out take of the prosses as well (not just the substrate), maybe we can use it to create a test for degradation.
- Maybe looking for agent orange, and check where in the degradation prosses it becomes detoxify and the enzymes relevant for that.
- Send a mail to the beijing team to understand their work.
- Mosquna and shai says that trying to understand the uptake of TCDD to the plant is a big task.
- If we start researching the uptake by plants we should add it to our project even if we weren`t able to combine the degradation and uptake in the same plant.
- Shai expresses his positivity in adding the arabidopsys to the project.
- Mosquna says that when they want to check something that it works the inject agrobacterium to the leaves of tobacco.
- We need to grow the arabidopsis in advance to shorten"
Danzi_Kesh_8,2015,Team:Danzi Kesh 8#Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," our town, Kiryat Shmona, and social networks, there is place to begin activities that encourage the topic at large through the all channels in Parliament. During the activity in the parliament we met with Member of Parliament Sheli Yechimovich and Opposition leader Yitzhak Herzog where we exposed them to the ambitions and goals, in response they supported and gave us their blessing, showed pride in us and promised to support when the law will come up for discussion.
Then we attended a discussion by the Committee of Children’s' Rights headed by Dr. Yifat Shasha Bitton. When the discussion ended, the Team members met with Naftali Bennet the Minister of Education, MP Meirav Ben Ari and MP Erel Margalit. We described the data we collected concerning the financial difficulties, the embarrassment of children in school, failure of early detection of the disease and the cost to the government, and of course a solution we offer to celiac disease patients.
During the conversation we brought up several possible solutions to correct the current situation:
Adding gluten-free foods in all schools across the country.
To lower the prices of gluten-free products.
Striving for early tests of the disease among families with celiac disease (for it is a hereditary disease), to save the patient the ongoing pain or the development of associated diseases.
During the meeting we emphasized the importance to promote the law on the topic of celiac disease and increase awareness of the disease. MP Meirav Ben-Ari spoke to us about the important issue and advised us on the legal aspects of the issue, she told us that she herself is sensitive to gluten and she intends to work actively on the development of the issue and supports us all the way, the Minister of Education was very impressed by the idea and initiative, and also promised to support and help as needed. The Education Minister promised to consider the Knesset also gluten-free as well as the education system even though it is very complex and costly.
We returned very satisfied from the activity with the exposure we gave about our project and our field of activities. We are convinced that our meeting has created a buzz among members of parliament and made them think deeply about this matter.
As public opinion on the subject will grow, even greater pressure on MPs will increase to create a real change.
Participation in the Knesset general assembly discussion
The topic of discussion: initial creation to change legislation regarding celiac disease based on the following points. The speaker in the discussion was celiac patient Knesset Member who testified about her difficulties as an allergic to gluten. During the discussion the points were raised"

The same program as in Table 2 was used, except the extension time was set to 4 minutes and the annealing temperate was 47 +- 5 degrees Celsius. Figure 5 also shows the wrong size of chiB, but at this point I did not quite realize it.
Figure 5. Photo of a 1% TAE gel loaded with chiA and chiB PCR products, BBa_J04450 as a positive control and water as a negative control. The expected size for chiA is 1913 basepairs, for chiB 1722 basepairs. The gel was run for 30 minutes at 100V.
Though the OneTaq gradient PCR clearly worked, I had to make a PCR work with a polymerase that has proofreading activity. I did one PCR with Pfu polymerase, but that failed as even my positive control showed no band.  I repeated the Q5 PCR to add BBa_B0032 one more time, but now with an annealing temperature at 52 degrees Celsius, 10 degrees below the NEB recommended temperature. The results are shown in Figure 6.

Week 3
This week, the PCR products with added RBS were cloned into pSB1C3 with BBa_B0015. Purified plasmids digested with XbaI and PstI were checked for the correct lengths (Figure 6). While chiA had the correct length, it was not digested correctly; I figured out that my RBS primers were wrong and did not include the AG nucleotides for the XbaI site in the prefix. Additionally, I realized that chiA was too short. The plasmids were sequenced and my suspicions were confirmed.

To introduce our project to the public, we chose to work together with the Christoph-Jacob Treu ( CJT ) high school. The school gave us the opportunity to participate in their summer festival in July. As the audience members included 5-year-old siblings as well as their parents and grandparents, we decided to do a small workshop on the manufacturing of do-it-yourself solar cells.
How to build your own solar cell
In this tutorial, the construction of a DSSC will be explained in detail.
Materials
2 FTO glass slides
1 small normal glass slide
4 g TiO2
5 ml HCl (1M)
Pencil
Scotch tape
Bunsen Burner
Hibiscus tea
Blow-dryer
I2/KI solution
2 clips
2 alligator clips
Multimeter
Cables
Sunlight or lamp
First of all, two FTO glass slides have to be cleaned. One is put aside for later use, the other one will be coated with a layer of TiO2. TiO2 is mixed with HCl and ground until no lumps are left, yielding a viscous paste.  On the conducting side of the FTO, two long borders and one short border are masked with scotch tape. Approximately 100 µl of the TiO2 paste are placed onto the FTO and spread evenly in the area between the scotch tape using the normal glass slide. By doing this, a 100 µm thin layer of TiO2 is created. The layer has to be dried for 20 minutes using a blow-dryer. In order to increase the surface of the TiO2 layer for better dye adsorption, the FTO is sintered. In other words, it is placed on a tripod with a working Bunsen burner underneath"

Hello! I’m a lovely Kidney baby, an essential organ in your body. Can you see those sparkling items                     pointed by my hand? Right! This is a wonderful liquid crystal show caused by the combination of                     β2-MG and nanobodies. What’s more, the different concentrations of β2-MG make                     the different degree of brightness showed by liquid crystal. We can make use of this phenomenon to                     achieve early detection of CKD caused mostly by diabetes and high blood pressure according to the brightness displayed by the detector confidently. Such an amazing idea, right?

Introduction
Our project would not have been possible without the hard work and advice of a whole host of people. On this page you can find who has contributed what to the project.
The Team
The team consisted of bioengineers and life scientists. You can find out who we are here . We came up with idea for the project at the beginning of July through an internal brainstorming process and developed it independently. Unless otherwise stated, all the experiments, constructs, code and results documented on this wiki was performed and collected by us, the students. The wiki was designed and constructed by the team with a foundational homepage design by Nestor Azevedo Pestana (RCA).

Nevertheless, various publications have already demonstrated the Mycobacterium avium implantation in the lungs, thus proving the credibility and feasibility of this study.
From the results above, we determined the signature of a sample of Mycobacterium avium by flow cytometry (red zone R1). The left image corresponds to background noise or signal of the cytometer. However, It would have been very interesting to make a 3rd control, with the acquisition of a sample of lungs of mice not infected with M.avium .
In the above samples, it is difficult to find specifically the signature of the « mycobacterium » sample. It is also very difficult to discern any difference between the 2 mouse model, Nod Scid and Black 6.
The opposite samples, does not allow us to determine a possible influence of the subcutaneous tumor on the mycobacterial tropism, or even to differentiate the M. avium tropism in this model, from others models.
Back to top
Discussion
This experiment achieved only a single time, failed to meet our goals, to identify and quantify the M. avium tropisms. However, lack of time is another factor to consider. Indeed, this analysis by flow cytometry was performed one week after the injection of M. avium in mice. After reading various publications, it is interesting to note that the significant data of M. avium implantation in the lungs, are obtained after many weeks. Therefore, it explains our difficulty to quantify by flow cytometry, the presence of the vector tissue after one week.
The above figure is extracted from the publication «  Thymus as a target for mycobacterial infections  ». A similar protocol was performed with injection of 10 ^ 6 CFU / ml M. <i> avium administered intravenously. . It is described in this figure that the lungs are infected from the first day of infection, but in very small amount (just over 10 ^ 1, then it is more prolonged with the rapid spread (10 ^ 1 to 10 ^ 6 CFU / organ in less than 5 weeks). This proves, therefore, that the lungs are colonized by  M. avium .

Conclusion
Although our experiment does not prove significantly the presence of M. avium in the lung, it has been proven many times that this type of bacteria colonizes the lung. This organ is a one of the natural tropisms of M. avium in mice and humans.

DESCRIPTION
Background Information
This year our team has decided to focus on increasing the speed and overall efficiency of blood coagulation in medium to large sized wounds. Although there are other products currently available in the market to increase the rate of blood coagulation, such as Quikclot (Z-Medica, 2014), or VetiGel (Bloomberg, 2014), our product is significantly different from these. Our product, called “Coagu.coli”, is based on using a component from the snake venom of the Desert Horned Viper (Cerastes cerastes).
Certain components of snake venoms are able to bypass several steps of the blood clotting cascade, therefore increasing the speed of blood clotting (Braud, 2000; Castro, Zingali, Albuquerque, Pujol-Luz, & Rodrigues, 2004).
The component we are utilizing is Cerastotin and this is a serine protease that has thrombin like properties. What sets Cerastotin apart from other serine proteases is that it is easy to express and small enough to be used in our construct. Thrombin is an enzyme that causes the conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin, which leads to the formation of a clot (Smith, 1980; Wolberg, 2007). By using Cerastotin in our construct, we are therefore able to greatly increase the efficiency and speed of blood coagulation.
Our product would be applied by a syringe containing our construct followed by a bandage for sealing it in place, and could be used in a variety of situations. Because our product would be produced in E.Coli, it would be highly affordable as a great amount can be expressed in a short period of time. The military, hospitals, and the average person would find our product invaluable. Coagu.coli has the power to prevent death by severe blood loss by giving a person enough time to receive further medical attention.

The therapeutically useful derivatives of morphine is would work well with this system allowing the light based selection of a number of products from a common precursor. These compounds all analgesics have a similar structure but have a wide range of uses. Morphine is a very powerful analgesic as is heroin both controlled substances but another member codeine is available to buy in most countries as a weak analgesic (pain relief), an antitussive (cough medicine) and an antidiarrheal (diarrhoea treatment.

Who is CACCI?
CACCI, called the same as Kathy, is a constructed bacteria for Characterization of Antibiotic Concentration based on Chemotaxis and Interference.
Although, construction of ROSE will specifically recognize the concentration of different antbiotics in the river samples, its feature is also deficiency: that is too specificity may hurt extensive measurement. Besides, using traditional genetically modified circuit to express report is still time-consuming, comparing with general physical or chemical measurement approaches.
Consequently, we orginally esatblished CACCI based on chemotaxis and interference to make a wider scale level antibiotic molecules detection, even other chemical molecules. So, the mechanism and construction of CACCI can be divided into the following schedules:
Chemotaxis Modification: to increase the bacterial movement capability, modification based on E. coli chemotaxis related parts cheZ will be introduced into bacteria.
Adhesion: According to our modeling, we need to adhere bacteria to a surface. Theoratically, interference will be observed when elastic deformation occured on membrane caused by bacteria motility containing cheZ parts, covalent ligation will be established between bacteria and membrane to ensure the stable adhesion. In order to achieve covalently adhesion, modification on bacteria transmembrane protein will be necessary.
Interference: When bacteria have been adhered to membrane and treated in water sample, movement will cause interference. The interference pattern will be different at distinct chemical molecules concentration.
Processing: These patterns will be captured by CCD camera. Our control system containing interference pattern recognition will process these patterns, and finally a work curve will be established corresponding antibiotics concentration to different interference pattern.

What is Chemotaxis?
Chemotaxis is a phenomenon of the movement of an organism, specifically cells or bacteria, stimulated by chemical molecules. As for bacteria, naturally, chemoreceptors were expressed on bacteria membrane, which enables bacteria to 'sense' the existence of chemical molecule concentration in the surroundings. Chemotaxis consists of two situation, including positive chemotaxis and negative chemotaxis, which respectively demonstrate different behaviour when exposed to surroundings with chemical molecules beneficial or harmful to bactiera metabolism and reproduction"

Result
coming soon…
We wanted to construct this part; pSB1C3-Pconst(W)-RBS-FA-linker-MS2-RBS-FB-linker-PP7-DT.
But we failed and constructed the part; pSB1C3-RBS-FB-linker-PP7-DT-Pconst.(W)-RBS-FA-linker-MS2.
We evaluated using parts; pSB1C3- RBS-FB-linker-PP7-DT-Pconst.(W)-RBS-FA-linker-MS2, pSB1A2-Pconst.(H)-RNA scaffold-DT.
The GFP fluorescence was detected as expected. So we are constructing correct parts and evaluating.
Discussion
Future work
We are going to construct the HHR fused with RNA scaffold (HHR-RNA scaffold) and no self-cleavage mutant (HHR*-RNA scaffold). HHR-RNA scaffold is unable to form RNA scaffold without self-cleavage because RNA scaffold contain complementary sequence to HHR. So we will evaluate whether the formation of RNA scaffold is regulated by self-cleavage or not. After that, we will construct RNA oscillation system based on HHR that periodically release an RNA fragment containing RNA scaffold and result in engineering ""Twinkle. coli"". We will try to make Split luciferase and fuse the split luciferase to MS2 and PP7. By using the Split luciferase, E. coli emit light periodically like a firefly.
The oscillation system can also use its RNA scaffold for enzyme reactions. We sought other aptamers to increase the variety of BioBrick for enzyme reactions. Hung-Wei Yiu has reported RNA detection in living bacterial cells caused by binding of two RNA binding peptide, HTLV-1 Rex peptide and λN peptide, to two RNA aptamer. They fused these two peptides to split GFP and detect RNA which contains HTLV-1 Rex peptide and λN peptide aptamer. So we will construct and evaluate the system and resister as a BioBrick.

FLUORESCENT PROBE MODEL
Background
It can be seen from the reaction pathway that when the probe is excessive, the fluorescence                     intensity should be linear with the hydrogen peroxide content at a specific time. The model                     validates this linear relationship through experimental data and predicts future possible outcomes                     by constructing a linear regression model. Linear regression analysis
Definition
H2O2: The concentration of H2O2, units in mM.
FOD: Florescence intensity / OD.
Scatter Plot
The Scatter Plot of data are demonstrated below.
Fig.1
From the chart, it is clear that the FOD is in proportion to the H2O2, only                     when H2O2 is between                     0-2.5 mM. The data in the points that H2O2 is 5 are obviously not obeying                     linear model. Thus, we                     consider to building a linear model between 0 and 2.5mM of H2O2. The new                     Scatter Plot of this part                     of data is showed below.
Fig.2
The scatter plot witnessed a significant linearity of between FOD and H2O2,                     so we tend to use a                     linear model to predict and explain the results.
Model Construction
With the criteria of the least square, we construct following linear model
$$FOD_{i}=\beta_{0}+\beta_{1}\ H_{2}O_{2_{i}}+\epsilon_{i},\epsilon_{i} \sim                     N(0,\sigma^2)$$
The property of the model are demonstrated below
Fig.3
It is obvious that the data fits linear model well and the parameters are following
$$FOD_{i}=4752+1214.48\ H_{2}O_{2_{i}}+\epsilon_{i},\epsilon_{"
