Bielefeld-CeBiTec,2017,Team:Bielefeld-CeBiTec#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," for Science in Bonn. We answered this call and met with other iGEM teams from the region to stand up for the importance of science and reliable facts in our modern society. It was a great event and we had a lot of fun and got to know the team Cologne Duesseldorf , with which we held close contact throughout the whole year.

13.05, 15.07 - Meetings with Team Cologne Duesseldorf
After participating in the March for Science in Bonn, the iGEM team Cologne Duesseldorf invited us to a team meet-up. Thus, on the 13th of May, some of our team members drove to Dusseldorf and had a very fun and exciting day in this beautiful city. We also wanted to offer the team Cologne Duesseldorf the opportunity to visit us in Bielefeld in return. Some team members visited us at the 15th of July and we had a delicious BBQ and showed them the city, the CeBiTec, and our lab.

30.06 - German Meet-up in Dresden
On the 30th of June, we participated in the German Meet-up in Dresden and represented our team and our project. It was the first time we presented our project to the public which is why the presentation was very exciting for our speaker Chris. It was also interesting to see what other teams planned to work on over the year and we are very curious to see what they and we will achieve until the Giant Jamboree in November.

Ligations—three part ligations; if those do not work we will PCR amplify the ligated insert   PIF3 ligations appeared to yield colonies, but PhyB ligations did not. I think this is attributable to the difference in sizes. PIF3 full is 1600, PIF3 partial is 300, cFluc is 450, PhyB is 1800, nFluc is 1200, so the combination of the 1200+1600 into the 6 kb vector may be too much. This is based on the fact that the PIF3 partial with the smallest inserts has a lot of colonies but the PIF3 full has only a handful. There are a couple of things to try.  1.

2.2 Bauhinia Festival of Science and Culture
In our university, the annual Bauhinia Festival of Science, Technology and Culture is a great activity, thousands of citizens in Guangzhou gather together in SCAU to enjoy the beautiful flower of bauhinia and new research in our university. This year, we seized this opportunity and showed interesting biology to many visitors, mostly young persons and children. We showed microscope and tissue culture technology. We made some beautiful postcards about SCAU or iGEM. We brought some books and brochures about some laws and funny things about GMO. For example, sweet potato has some DNA originating from Agrobacterium, which means they are natural transgenic in the world.
Our work turned out to be a great success. The most famous newspaper in our city--Guangzhou Daily interviewed our team leader and reported us with a brief introduction of our project and this activity. SCAU newspaper and SCAU Official WeChat also highlighted our activities.
2.3 Education
Our education included spreading scientific knowledge to the kids and farmers in the countrysides and giving courses for high school students.
2.4 Spread scientific knowledge to countrysides
Our country is a developing country and those people in countrysides can hardly get as much information and knowledge as those in cities. So we decided to do more efforts to spread our knowledge to farmers and students in countrysides. We sent our educational handbooks to farmers and rural schools in Qingyuan, Shaoguan, Maoming and Zhaoqing of Guangdong province.
The handbooks contain lots of information about modern methods of cultivating the local specialty crops, including protocol of cultivating watermelon and papaya fruit in modern way. It's possible that we can help some people in countryside who are eager to get more information on agriculture, and they might generally accept modern agriculture or even GMO crops.
Our teammates gave basic and funny biology courses in primary schools in countrysides. Our lessons may influence their lives and change their fate.
2.5 Giving courses for high school students
We also gave courses for high school students of Guangzhou NO.47 Middle School, Guangdong experimental High School and Guangdong Guangya High School. Our courses mainly focused on"

That still doesnt explain why our tests are glowing green in the absence of cholera. We will have to work backwards and find out exactly what it is that we have. I feel that we have a clearer view of what we need to do. Also, I need to do more research other than wikipedia on lambda phage and its lytic and lysogenic cycles, because in our presentation, I said that that lambda enters the lytic cycle when it is in a cell that is healthy and lysogenic cycle when the cell is in trouble. That is what it says on wikipedia. Anyway, when I said that, I was told that I was wrong and that it is the other way around. I will look into that. We also hopefully got our quorum sensing system worked out now. All we need to do (once we figure out what we actually have in our plasmids) is add the cro transcription site after the GFP, and in the presence of cholera more cro will be produced and lambda will enter the lytic cycle!
- KK Today was our presentation in class. This is the link to our powerpoint presenation: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/14mUxVrUdTvNXaPGifXZs_lpXeMrFd-4CxSZ9o1bPqYo/edit#slide=id.p Our presentation gave a background for our project - though we ought to have been clearer WHY we want to use phage - and also the work that we’ve accomplished thus far in our group. We went a long time over in our presentation; it took a long time to explain the quorum sensing circuit, Lambda, and other things. Dr Grose sent an email with several suggestions for presentations in the future. They include being more concise with our time management and better coordinating within our group so that we don’t end up repeating ourselves. In the future we will be expected to be more polished presenters.

We didn’t have too much time to do our own experiments, but we did set up an overnight to do mini-prep tomorrow, and we streaked out our plates of lambda phage. - KK The three phage groups presented today.

The diagnostic tools currently employed to detect fungal pathogens:
The methods employed to diagnose fungal infections at present vary in performance as each type of pathogen has a greater proclivity for being detected by some tests than others. However, microscopy has always been the mainstay as far as diagnosis of fungal infections is concerned. We look forward to improve the diagnostic capabilities of conventional microscopy by enhancing specificity and visibility through the application of molecular biology.The following table was compiled from Fungal Infection Thrust .

Detection by Polymerase Chain Reaction
The table above denotes a summary of the techniques used at present to detect the leading fungal pathogens in the world. Note that the column titled ""DNA detection"" is a  term that mainly involves the use of the Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) to detect pathogens. Although it is touted as a reliable technique, it has several disadvantages such as high cost, requirement of laboratory settings of high standards and false positives due to detection of pathogenic DNA EVEN AFTER the resolution (clearance) of the disease. Finally, PCR amplifies the DNA in a sample and  only gives qualitative results. While Real-Time PCR can give information on the initial amount of the sample, it requires RNA samples which are degraded by RNases in the body and even if it is not, it requires a well equipped laboratory to prevent further degradation.There"

Figure 1. Structure of TALEs derived from Xanthomonas sp. (Sanjana et al, 2013)
2. What did We Do ?
As explained before in the Background, we try to make a prototype based on the concept of Calgary Team 2013 . So we construct a new TALEs that can bind with our target sequences, especially in HPV 18 and HPV 16. For building the detector, we received help from Freiburg Team 2012 to construct two new TALEs. First, we search the target sequences with the alignment of whole genome of HPV 18 and HPV 16 via NCBI and MEGA5. We search two target sequences in left side and right side. Here are some works that we’ve done:
Left side: site 7106 until 7119
Right side: site 7851 until 7864
3. CONSTRUCTING TALEs
Based on Freiburg Team 2012 method , we designed our TALE into 2, TALE 1 and TALE 2.
For TALE 1, we use:
(1) BBa_K747012,
(2) BBa_K747016,
(3) BBa_K747042,
(4) BBa_K747048,
(5) BBa_K747064,
(6) BBa_K747091
For TALE 2, we use:
(1) BBa_K747012,
(2) BBa_K747026,
(3) BBa_K747036,
(4) BBa_K747052,
(5) BBa_K747076,
(6) BBa_K747095
4. VECTOR
For the vector for our TALEs, we received help from Lucas Schneider (member of Freiburg Team 2012) and Nicole Densch (Labmanager from BIOSS , Freiburg). We request the pTALEN and pTAL – TF from BIOSS and sent it to us on Whatman paper. Based on Sanjana et al. (2013), TALE-TFs are constructed by replacing the natural activation domain within the TALE C-term with the synthetic transcription activation domain VP64.
Figure 2. TALEs can be used to generate custom transcription factors (TALE-TFs) and modulate the transcription of endogenous genes from the genome (Sanjana et al., 2013)

TU_Delft-Leiden,2014,Team:TU Delft-Leiden#Human Practices#stakeholders_-_-_TEXT.html," In the end this was classified as an inefficient method.
Apart from asking about the current used methods, we also asked more details about the process itself. Mr. Brady exemplified on one of their most recent works in Lebanon –where they are doing battle area clearance from the 2006 war. They tend to have a team of nine people going out early morning, coming back mid-day. The limitations of this approach: once they fund something, need to deal with national authorities that regulate that.
The most efficient method: the tool box –manual deming  represents “the bread and butter” of what they do, although is not as fast as dogs and machines (flails, rollers) are also employed, mostly to discount areas. The first challenge is that they are given a very large area and delineating  it down takes some time. Therefore, the first step is discounting the initial area to get to the area where the actual problem is they go with a manual team for the surface clearance.
Typically a single demander –one man lane can clear approximately 25 square meters per day, up to 50 square meters depending on the conditions. Anything beyond this number is questionable in terms of safety, comprehensiveness and accuracy.  In addition, the soil type impacts  the number of  false positives.
To overcome the dog usage limitations, there are experiments with loose free range dogs. This implies, not keeping them on the line, and thus bringing some versatility. In the current methods they are boxing the area.  Moreover, one organization is using rats for detection. The idea is similar as the dogs for the detection method.  However, “at the end the day they are back to one man detection”. There are areas that are so contaminated that goes directly to excavation, according to the standards.
We asked Mr. Brady if the current methods suffice.  His main answer was that methods that are faster would be great.  For instance, he gave an example about a South African Company that takes their samples across instead of brining the dogs. That has been useful to overcome the limitations of the dogs, but not completely.
There have been tweaks on the way landmines detection is done, but no major leaps on speed and versatility were achieved yet. Speed, versatility and maintaining the safety standards are some of the most important elements that need to be taken into account in the detection method.
In addition, when dealing with landmines clearance there are also several social limitations: poor infrastructure, low level of education of the workers, due to the fact they don’t have great exposure to technology.  Another problem is"

Modeling
Mathematical models and computer simulations provide a great way to describe the function and operation of BioBrick Parts and Devices. Synthetic Biology is an engineering discipline, and part of engineering is simulation and modeling to determine the behavior of your design before you build it. Designing and simulating can be iterated many times in a computer before moving to the lab. This award is for teams who build a model of their system and use it to inform system design or simulate expected behavior in conjunction with experiments in the wetlab.
Inspiration
Here are a few examples from previous teams:
ETH Zurich 2014
Waterloo 2014"
UIUC_Illinois,2015,Team:UIUC Illinois#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," scalability. These devices require orthogonal transcription factors or recombinases, and are either unable to maintain their epigenetic, digital state in a noisy cellular environment, or require complex engineering to allow writing to occur directly into DNA. Furthermore, digital memory is inherently limited by its ability to only record the presence or absence of an input, without recording how much input existed, or for how long it was there for.
To escape these issues, Fahim Farzadfard and Timothy K. Lu developed SCRIBE (Synthetic Cellular Recorders Integrating Biological Events), which is a system that can record both the magnitude and long-term temporal behavior of inputs over a range of values - not just digital signals.
How It Works: Overview
In the 1980s, a retroelement called a retron was discovered in various species of gram-negative bacterium. This retron was able to produce msDNA, multicopy single-stranded DNA. It was found that certain regions of the msDNA could be modified, introducing the ability to specifify the ssDNA produced in the cell. This was then placed under the control of various promoters and coexpressed with Beta recombinase, which allowed for, given that the ssDNA had the appropriate homology requirements, recombination into the genome of E. coli. Given that there are 10E-4 recombination events per generation, only a portion of the population will undergo the recombination event. A linear relationship between concentration of inducer and recombination frequency is observed when the data is plotted on a log-log graph. Therefore, by observing the number of recombinants (through functional assays or sequencing), one is able to deduce the amount of inducer that the E. coli population was exposed to.

How It Works: In Depth
In the 1980s, a research group discovered a retroelement (called a retron) in a species of gram-negative bacterium (Myxococcus xanthus), which was able to produce a single-stranded, linear DNA fragment [3]. Retrons are distinct DNA sequences that code for a reverse transcriptase which is able to synthesize a peculiar DNA-RNA hybrid molecule called msDNA, in which the 5' end of the DNA forms a 2'-5' phosphodiester bond with an internal guanosine residue of the RNA [4].
There are three components for a single transcript of this retron cassette: a reverse transcriptase, and two RNA portions, msr and msd, which are the"

Toulouse_France,2016,Team:Toulouse France#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," team worked on fungi, and constructed strains able to secrete antifungals. We used these strains in order to: have a positive control when our bacteria will be functional, test the efficiency of the antifungals, and find the best temperature, medium and technique. We also determined what was the more efficient between using the supernatant, the bacteria, or a mix of both. All these tests were performed on a fungi mat.
Dry lab:
We decided to create a device to confine our modified bacteria. We designed it using Blender.
Wet lab:
The transformation of E. coli with the construction of a NagA inducible promoter in pSB1C3 worked, it was the first big step! However, transformation with our antifungals and toxin genes did not work. As the cloning with pNagA is validated, we started trying to clone this insert in the shuttle plasmid pSB0K-P from 2012 iGEM Munich team, and to transform it in E. coli.
Some gBlocks were still in process to be amplified by PCR. We tried different programs, by modifying the elongation time or the hybridization temperature.
The genes (sdp and skf) for our predation module should be cloned by the Gibson method. The clonings did not work.
Dry lab:
As the PCR of gBlocks do not work very well, we designed other primers to improve the compatibility between the template and the primers.
For the modelling, we designed the prey-predator model to have a simulation of the activity of our modified B. subtilis.
Wet lab:
We continued trying to clone our insert pNagA in the shuttle plasmid pSB0K-P, using different strategies. Indeed, we tried to digest the DNA fragments with different enzymes. Nevertheless this plasmid is quite big (>9 kbp) and thus it is harder to clone than a smallest plasmid. As a consequence, we thought about a strategy to reduce the size of this plasmid.
The cloning of some gBlocks in pSB1C3 worked! They are an antifungals part and toxin/antitoxin genes. We started to clone it in pSB0K-P and to transform it in E. coli.

Overview
An important part of iGEM is Human Practice, which we understand not only as communication with a broader public but also as reflection of the project in a general aspect. This includes biosafety and biosecurity, social aspects as well as the implementation of the project into industrial processes and evaluation of experts and environmental issues. Therefore economical factors and political terms have to be considered. Finally we want to show the potential of the project as a possible realistic alternative to conventional and traditional methods of waste water treatment concerning the depletion of steroid hormones as estrogen and other pharmaceutical relevant substances. In the sections expert, politics and industry we tried to evaluate our project in economical manner with the consideration of political terms. The sections environment, education and outreach focus on social aspects, including the environmental situation and communication with a broader public.
Expert
In this section you can read more about the expert classification we got for our project. We presented our project to get feedback for our ideas.
We attended at the strategy process ""Biotechnologie2020+"".

Politics
Here you can find our project evaluation with Rene Röspel, member of the german parliament, the ''Bundestag''.
For the development of a project from planning to application political terms are important. Not only the economical factors but also the public opinion and acceptance depend on the political situation. Furthermore bioethics are especially important when developing a project in modern life sciences. Therefore we discussed about bioethics as well as regulations.

Industry
An important part of a project development is the evaluation in cooperation with potential partners. Therefore we visited two sewage treatment plants and together with the plant managers we could work out an easy way"
Stockholm,2018,Team:Stockholm#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," gave us important insights in the use of enzymes for our purpose.
Input:
Introduced us to fungal enzymes specifically from Trametes versicolor, since it degrades pharmaceuticals well.
Guna also encouraged us to immobilize the enzyme on a carrier instead of genetically engineered organisms in an open or semi-open system.
Introduced us to the HELCOM and UNESCO report on the Status of pharmaceuticals in the Baltic Sea region, which is the biggest monitoring study of pharmaceutical substances in the Baltic Sea region.
Adjustment:
We decided to use the laccase of Trametes versicolor.
We investigated different enzyme immobilization techniques.
We investigated a range of possible targets for the laccase and picked the ecotoxic antibiotic Sulfamethoxazole from the report. Its concentration in surface water is high and it is not well removed from wastewater with the current techniques. This allowed us to address the problem of ecotoxicity and antibiotic resistance.
First Stage: The enzyme in a catheter
×
After the first input from Guna and Berndt we came up with our first vision: a catheter with a filter containing the enzyme, which degrades pharmaceuticals before the urine is discarded in the sewage system. These enzymes could be specific for degrading the antibiotics that the patient is taking.
Brainstorming with our advisors
×
Description: Our team discussed the 1st stage idea and its impact with our advisors.
Input:
Urine from catheters are not the main source of pharmaceuticals entering the environment. Although many patients have catheters, people in Sweden are generally treated with antibiotics at home or in elderly homes, accounting for the majority of pollution.
Laccase can be improved since it does not detoxify Sulfamethoxazole very fast, which could gave our project a new dimension.
Adjustment:
Moved our focus to municipal wastewater treatment plants.
Our drylab team explored molecular modelling to improve SMX and understand the enzymatic reaction.

This figure illustrates the prioritisation of all fields. The top prioritised field was research about diseases, secondly pharmaceutical production and lastly industrial production.
Figure 4.
This diagram shows the answer rate to how much the public knows about genetically modified microorganisms, where the answers variated from ""none"" to ""very much"" on the x-axis and number of people on the y-axis.
As can be seen, most people feel that they have poor knowledge about the field of synthetic biology. This is something that should be taken into account when trying to communicate what we are doing in the lab. As a result of this, we tried to communicate our project through multiple channels. For example: when we took care about the Instagram account aimed at potential and current students at Linköping University (LiU Student at instagram) we tried to tell what we are doing through short videos, pictures and short texts. Instagram post in swedish We hope that this proved a more engaging way to find out about the project.
We asked the public about what they think GMO:s should be used for, which can be seen  in figure 5, 6, 7 and 8. Overall, the majority of the public agree that GMO should be used for research about diseases, production of medicine and research about biological fuels. Only when asked if GMO should be used for industrial production, less than half did agree completely.  In conclusion, from the results, we gathered that the public is more concerned and has a more negative attitude to industrial production, see figure 6.

BIT,2018,Team:BIT-China#Applied Design_-_-_TEXT.html," for health and beauty, many chemical detection methods emerged around the                         20th century. (such as, oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC), total oxyradical scavenge                         capacity (TOSC), the peroxyl scavenging capacity (PSC), the ferric reducing/antioxidant power                         assay (FRAP), Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC) and so on)
The main measurement principle of chemistry methods is to characterize the reducibility of                     antioxidants by redox reaction with kinds of oxyradical. Chemistry methods has the advantages of                     handy, efficiency and accuracy.
However, this measurement principle is one-dimensional. On the one hand, its detecting conditions                     are almost different from the physiological environment that cell live in so that chemistry methods                     can't evaluate the antioxidant capability of antioxidants in the complicated metabolic process. On                     the other hand, living cells are integrated with multiple natural anti-oxidant systems, including                     anti-oxidant enzyme system, reductive system, post-damage repair system and so on in which                     antioxidants play a significant role and chemistry methods can't provide the stage of living cell.                     By the way, in 2012, USDA's Nutrient Data Laboratory (NDL) removed the USDA ORAC Database for                     Selected Foods from the NDL website because of the poor authenticity and low credibility of the                     chemistry methods. To sum up, the disadvantages of the chemical methods are two key words, low                     biological relevance and low credibility.
So, we design a detection system based on living cells that create a living-cell stage for                     antioxidants' performance. This improves biological relevance and credibility and the living cell                     is yeast, Saccharomyces Cerevisiae.
Why do we choose Saccharomyces Cerevisiae?
We chose yeast as the chassis cell of the product rather than HepG2 liver cancer cells, macrophage                     cells or Caco-2 colon cancer cells ect. Why?
● First, as we all know, the early researches on the mechanism of human diseases were explained                         by means of model organism yeast.
● Second, aging of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae in stationary culture, often referred to                         as 'chronological aging', is a frequently applied system to study aging of eukaryotic cells.
● Last but not least, recently, human beings have the ability to synthesize yeast genome,                         which is an amazing breakthrough in the history of understanding of nature. Therefore, we                         choose yeast because of its practical application value and great potential in future.

Kozak Sequence
The Kozak sequence is the eukaryotic analog to the bacterial RBS, it is required for efficient initiation of translation. There is  only one yeast Kozak sequence in the registry (part BBa_J63003 , distributed in the 2012 kit ).  Note that this sequence codes for a glutamic acid (E) after the start codon.
We decided to create a new part (<partinfo>BBa_K792001</partinfo>) using the 5’UTR of the MFα1 gene of yeast, partly because we used the signal peptide from this gene (see below). This gene is efficiently translated in yeast, and therefore it stands to reason that translation is efficiently initiated on its mRNA.

The results for the SP theophylline could not be clearly regarded as reliable then. To check for the SP Dickinson and to validate the results for SP theophylline the plaque assay was once more repeated. But unfortunately the negative control in this plaque assay showed a contamination. In order to get rid of the contamination, we performed several following plaque assays using completely new prepared materials.
Also new SP theophylline needed to be reproduced (from phage supernatant + stock 47 in 2YT + Carb)
2. Test constructs for Riboswitch and CYP1A2: The next step, was a double transformation of the pSB4K5 (riboswitch) and pSB1C3 (CYP1A2) in Top 10 chemically competent cells. The colonies were picked to grow growths that are used for further testing. The growth was diluted 1:100 and caffeine or theophylline in different concentrations were added (5 mM, 500 �M,  50 �M, 5 �M, 0,5 �M) respectively. To ensure induction of the Lac Promotor IPTG was added (1:1000) as well as the required antibiotics (Kanamycin and Chloramphenicol).
3. HPLC Test: Several samples have been run over the C18 column of the HPLC (theophylline 1 mg/ml, caffeine 1 mg/ml and a mix of theophylline and caffeine 1:1). The mix showed isolated peaks at about 5.92 min for theophylline and 9.23 min for caffeine. The test runs with the pure samples could not be conducted by implication (probably operating mistakes due to little experience with the HPLC).

The DNA sequence of the AP_dark_Ppsp_EL222-BR out of Top 10 cells was correct, whereas the cells, which were thought to be AP_light (in S1030) exhibited the sequence of AP_dark.

Calgary,2013,Team:Calgary Entrepreneurial#Project#Technology#_-_-_TEXT.html," the FREDsense biosensor can become a product, we needed to begin characterization of the live cell reporting system and design a prototype of how the device would work. We address progress towards prototype design and manufacture in more detail in the Operations section
In making a live cell biosensor, we need to characterize the rate of response in which an enzyme will work to produce the analyte. A kinetic model was built for the activity of a hydrolase in MatLab, predicting that a response could be detected within 4 minutes of adding the substrate to the enzyme when read electrochemically. This experiment was then performed with live cell induction of hydrolase expression. The results were consistent with the model's prediction, informing our design of the protocol for the biosensor. As we characterize the sensing micro-organism more fully, we will use predictive modeling of its behavior to develop quantitative interpretation of toxin level in solution.
Figure 7: Model prediction and experimental results correlate for the production of the electroactive compound PNP.  Experimental and modelling results for the uidA gene to cause cleavage of PNPG into PNP. Both results show that a detectable level of PNP is reached in under 4 minutes.
To take our live cell detector into the field, we needed to convert equipment that would normally fill a lab bench to a portable, user-friendly device. We began this process with the design and development of an inexpensive, small, and portable potentiostat. Required circuitry being printed onto a small circuit board. Samples would be loaded through a one-way valve into a sample cartridge (adapted 15mL culture tube) containing the cells, electrochemical substrates, and other reagents required to produce the electrochemical response. The sample cartridge also has a disposable electrode accessible to the sample. The cartridge/electrode plugs into a slot, connecting it to the circuitboard and power source. The device is also equipped with LED lights to indicate what step of the analysis process is currently running and indicate when it has completed.
While more sophisticated potentiostats function well for our detection, we will ultimately need a small portable version that functions well for our needs. We developed a custom software package within the MatLab platform to interpret and display the data obtained from electrochemical measurement. Ultimately we will want the Graphical User Interface (GUI) to convert the amplitude of electrochemical response to the concentration of chemical being sampled.

Senior High School: A newly set-up iGEM team
As for senior high school, we organized some lectures to introduce synthetic biology and our project. Firstly, we held a lecture in High School Affiliated to Fudan University (FDFZ). And this lecture gave us unexpected pleasure.
FDFZ is a well-known high school in Shanghai having a long history. And thanks to the abundant resource of Fudan University, the students of FDFZ can get easy access to top theory and technology in the science field and the atmosphere of exploring is really thick there. Thus, we reached a biology teacher in FDFZ discussing about holding a lecture in FDFZ and the possibility of establishing an iGEM high school team to help them participate in this creative competition. To attract more students to our lecture, we prepared beautiful posters for every classroom and made sufficient plans.     The outcome is more than fantastic. The number of students that came to our lecture is far over our expectation, and they were all eager to know iGEM and how to take part in it. Thus, we organized two interviews together with a teacher of FDFZ to select suitable students for future competition. In the interview, we asked about lots of things such as their basic knowledge of modern biology, experience in laboratory, the understanding of iGEM and their current ideas. To our surprise, some had attended the John Hopkins Summer Camp and had the experience of PCR, Western Blot and etc. And some had learned pharmacodynamic evaluation, mice emergency immunization, flow cytometry, labeling fluorescent antibody and so on. And their ideas were also innovative concerning Chinese traditional herb, malaria, controlling blood pressure, and regulation of K+. As for the division of labor, they also have their considerations. Some prefer wet laboratory, and others would like to major in modeling or visual designing…… We not only shared basic knowledge of synthetic biology, lab skills and safety rules with them in our mini-class, but also achieved a lot from them- discussing ethic and law issues in regard to advanced technology. What impressed us most is their passion on practice with their own hands. The knowledge they’ve learnt in class inspired fantastic ideas, while we provide a stage to help them realize. Welcome, new iGEMers!
It’s a really successful try, and we did help our next generation not only know about iGEM and synthetic biology but assist them to become one of us, to make them enjoy the interest of it. Now, a promising iGEM team is coming into formation and we will also support them theoretically and practically. The world is"

In order to make a further analysis on stability of the system, sensitivity of parameters, feedback factors-we manipulate all the arguments and parameters to make them dimensionless. Analysis of this part is crucial since parameters in vivo experiment may be different and even at odds with modeling ones but a proper dimensionless can reveal the mathematical essence of our model.

Bielefeld-Germany,2011,Team:Bielefeld-Germany#Results#BPA_-_-_TEXT.html," | BisdB fusion protein could be explained either by improved folding properties of the fusion protein or by the closer distance of BisdA and BisdB in the fusion protein leading to a faster electron transfer and therefore a more efficient reaction. In this case, which has to be further analysed by cell-free enzyme assays, a natural cytochrome P450 class I electron transport system was converted into a more effective class V electron transport system, demonstrating the new possibilities of synthetic biology. In addition, this new class V system would work without alanine-rich linker, potentially changing the view on cytochrome P450 depending electron transport chains.

International and domestic funding for malaria control and elimination totaled US$ 2.7 billion in 2013. Although this represents a threefold increase since 2005, it is still significantly below the US$ 5.1 billion that is required to achieve global targets for malaria control and elimination.
According to the WHO report for the future of Malaria control, to guarantee long-term efficacy of the core interventions, countries are commended to: strengthen efforts to prevent and manage drug and insecticide resistance as well as diverse vector behaviour; to remove all ineffective antimalarial medicines from markets; to further develop community-based diagnostic testing and treatment; and to impose pre- and post-shipment quality testing of vector control products. It also appeals for eradication of falciparum malaria from the Greater Mekong sub region, where multi-drug resistance has arisen."
Groningen,2016,Team:Groningen#HP#Gold_-_-_TEXT.html,"International Legislations
The next step was looking for international laws that regulate the shipping of GMOs around the world, since one of the applications of CryptoGErM is the shipping of Bacillus subtilis spores containing sensitive information across borders.
European legislations
Firstly, we were interested in the European legislations regarding the shipping of GMOs; it was found out that several European Countries, including the Netherlands, follow the regulations and guidelines suggested by the Cartagena Protocol for the transboundary shipment of Genetically Modified Organisms.
But what is it the Cartagena Protocol?
The Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety to the Convention on Biological Diversity is an international agreement on biosafety as a supplement to the Convention on Biological Diversity, whose principal aim is “to ensure the safe handling, transport and use of living modified organisms resulting from modern technology that may have adverse effects on biological diversity, taking also into account risks to human health” [2]
This protocol entered into force during September 2003, and it currently has 170 parties (167 United Nations member states, the State of Palestine and the European Union) [3] . However, other countries such as the United States of America, Canada and Argentina have not signed this agreement.
This protocol states in its Article 18 [4] (Handling, Transport, Packaging and Identification) the suggested documentation associated with the shipping of transboundary shipping of GMOs in order to avoid adverse effects. Such documentation includes:
Identify them clearly as Genetically Modified Organisms
Specify any extra requirements for the safe shipping
Include the contact information to whom the GMOs are consigned
Transatlantic regulations
Secondly, we started to look for the current international legislations and guidelines for the transatlantic shipment of GMOs.
We found out that such shipment is not regulated by just one International Institution, since countries around the world follow different legislations and guidelines between each other; for example, most European Countries, as mentioned above, follow the guidelines suggested by the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety, however, some countries such as the United States, Argentina, Canada, posses their own legislations for the shipment of GMOs.
Despite the fact that the legislations and guidelines between countries may be different between each other, e.g. Parties and No-Parties of the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety, the World Health Organization, an international and neutral Institution, launched in 2015 the Guidance on regulations for the Transport of Infectious Substances 2015-2016 [5] to “provide practical guidance to facilitate compliance with applicable international regulations for the"

Dutch Biotechnology Conference Wageningen (NBC-17)
16-05-17
Every year the Dutch biotechnology association organizes the Netherlands Biotechnology Conference. iGEM team Eindhoven, other iGEM teams and several other researchers were present to show their work or plans during the poster sessions. Before this poster session presenters were given the opportunity to explain their poster in a one minute pitch in the opening of the event. Apart from that there were lectures on current developments on Microbial System Biology & Synthetic Biology by several research groups from the VU, Wageningen University and RU Groningen. In the afternoon we attended a more interactive workshop from a delegate of the Dutch ministry of infrastructure and environment Virgil Rerimassie. The discussion was set on policy making in the field of biotechnology with an eye on the new perspectives form the biotech trend analysis 2016. An important point, which was stressed several times, is that researchers would like to see a more flexible case-to-case evaluation by policy makers. In this evaluation the relevant groups doing the research can assess their own work on safety instead of a generic one-size-fits-all list of precautionary measures. An interesting perspective and seemingly fitting to the fast changing field of biotechnology.
Luckily at the end of the day there were drinks and a buffet so the impressions of the day could be evaluated with the other students from the iGEM teams.
Meeting soon-to-be Biomedical Engineering Students
30-05-17, 13-06-17, 27-06-17
The faculty of Biomedical Engineering organizes several days each year where high school students interested in starting either Biomedical Engineering or Medical Science and Engineering can have a taste of the university. During this day the students attend introductory lectures and have a personal talk about their motivation and capabilities before enrolling in the study program.
On these days we as an iGEM team presented ourselves to the students-to-be about iGEM and iGEM team Eindhoven. We did this to make them aware of the possibility to join future teams and show what kind of research we are currently doing.

This case shows that big research topics (such as cancer research) that are researched at the universities can also benefit from crowdfunding platforms and such projects have a chance to engage with the public and raise necessary funds.
As part of our research we have analysed multiple crowdfunding projects and websites. We have performed a series of searches on several websites, typing ""biology"" or ""science"" into the search bar. Below is the summary of our findings, where we attempt to compare the platforms by their attitude and usefulness to scientific projects.

It is important to point out that in case of most popular sites, many projects found by searching for ""science"" and ""biology"" keywords aren't related to scientific research. Instead the project often includes portraying science in art or funding of technology-based products. That puts an important emphasis on sites such as Petridish which are entirely focused on science-related projects. Even though they tend to have a smaller user base, the projects and backers are much more focused which results in a fairly high rate of projects that are completely funded (in case of our search, "

Collaboration with Tianjin-iGEM
Teams trying to solve practical problems may meet problems when performing their integrated Human Practice. This year, in line with the principle of “to be more responsible and reflect more”, we joined the research conducted by Tianjin University on the transformation of biotechnology achievements. Through this expended research, we demonstrated the verified feasibility of the transformation of our iGEM project this year and made efforts on the practical execute solutions. Particularly in this research report presented in the collaboration, we were responsible to demonstrate how to transform of our project as an iGEM team.

SKLMT-China
In terms of collaboration, we have many communications with SKLMT-China. We used firefly luciferase report assay to characterize the strength of the promotor they provided and helped them establish the Pseudomonas fluorescence promoter pool. In detail, we electrotransform the plasmids into Pseudomonas fluorescens and used the intensity of the firefly controlled by the promoter to reflect the strength of the promoter. At the same time, SKLMT also used the reporter experiment to characterize our part. Thanks to the results came from them, we can verify our data and make the improve part section more complete.
Below is the result.

Field Trip to Tsinghua and Peking Universities
On July 20th and 21st, 2017, our team took a field trip to Tsinghua University and Peking University to attend a meeting with instructors and students from former iGEM teams. We explained our project idea and told them that our desire was to save people from the daily struggle with mosquito without concerning about toxic ingredient, and most importantly, to work as a prevention of the fatal mosquito-borne diseases. They warmly offered several specific suggestions in our experiment design and human practice. For instance, they strongly suggested us to test the effectiveness of citronellol , which could give more supports to our entire project. After the communication, we had a pleasant dinner and appreciated their help. Then they offered their contact to us, looking forward to our future research.
Experiment to test the effectiveness of citronellol
Advised by students and instructors form Tsinghua and Peking Universities, we planned an outdoor test to check if our citronellol was really effective.
Because of limitations in the institutions where we carry out our experiments, we could not find enough mosquitoes to test the effectiveness of citronellol. Therefore, we reached out to the School of Pharmacy in Southern Medical University in Guangzhou and came in contact with Dr. Jiabao Xu. We bought the readily prepared citronellol and Southern Medical University provided us with the mosquitoes we needed. Dr. Xu provided us with some advice, and we decided to carry out two series of experiments. The first experiment was an experiment to apply citronellol directly on hand to see how many times mosquitoes would bite. The second experiment was to separate a mosquito cage in half and test how mosquitoes would be attracted to humans with the protection of citronellol. With the help of Southern Medical University and Dr. Xu, we were able to test citronellol's effectiveness in replelling mosquitoes.
According to the data collected from our experiment, we could tell that citronellol could repel mosquitoes effectively. And since our procedures to produce citronellol was environment-friendly, we were confident that our project could have a positive impact on alleviating diseases and bites from mosquitoes.

ShanghaitechChina,2016,Team:ShanghaitechChina#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," test their idea,various cancer cell lines were required for the further explorations. However, when they turned to work on the cancer cells, they realized that later cell generations (normally after the fifth generation) could be applied better in the test, but not commercialized cancer cell clones. Additionally, due to the high expense of the cell clone as well as the long time period of the cell culture, it seemed impossible for the team to conducted their further experiments in cancer cells within the time frame necessary. Thankfully, our team just had the hela cell clone (the ninth generation) in stock which was originally prepared for our previous idea for the iGEM competition. Also, benefiting from some of the group members’ professional skills in cell culture, the cell clone demonstrated good viability. In response to the emergency request from the iGEM at JSNU, we very soon prepared the cell samples according to their needs, and sent the materials immediately.
They repeated their experiment among several varieties of cancer cell lines including Hela to see if their project can be realized on these cancer cells. However, The Hela cell seemed to be a little overexpressive of KLF4 that did not fit the situation well. Last but not least, the Hela cell became an indivisible part in their project and gave them new thinking.
Meanwhile, the wiki-design team at JSNU provided us assistance in creating avatars, where they drew a serious of cartoon bacteria characters based on the real photos of our team members. These avatars are plan to be used and will be showed at the Team Session on our wiki page later.

UC_Davis,2016,Team:UC Davis#GRAS_-_-_TEXT.html,"BGSC Accession # 1S1): This strain comprises spo0A mutants, therefore they do not produce alkaline or neutral proteases. They also do not sporulate. The two most abundant secreted proteases are the alkaline protease (AprE) and the neutral protease (NprE) and are produced in the early stationary phase in normal B. subtilis. This mutant does not produce these proteases, however wall-associated proteases are still present. This strain is the result of mutations in the Spo0A locus and have normal antibiotic sensitivities. Note that Spo0A have drastically reduced genetic competence, so electroporation is recommended to transform them (34).
The University of California - Santa Cruz iGEM team also was working on a project implementing B. subtilis as an expression chassis. In order to promote collaboration, we shared the B. subtilis spo0A3 strain, the B. subtilis PY70 strain, and the B. subtilis KO7 strains with the UCSC iGEM team. These strains were obtained from Daniel Zeigler, the director of the Bacillus Genetic Stock Center. Expressed written permission was obtained from Dr. Zeigler on July 14th approving material transfer of these organisms between our teams.
Genetic circuit
Our genetic construction for B. subtilis was performed next. Our summer goal was to obtain expression of a single GAF domain in B. subtilis. Although operon structure manipulations and a host of CBCR attempts were performed in E. coli, a single expression success was the goal for B. subtilis provided the disparity of experimentation between E. coli and B. subtilis in iGEM.
We first considered ribosome-binding site (RBS) sites for B. subtilis and any impact such sequences had on expression in this chassis. It was found that changes in ribosome-binding sites of mRNA impacted translational efficiency in B. subtilis substantially. In the work performed by this lab group, the influence of spacing between the Shine-Dalgarno sequence and the initiation codon was assessed. B. subtilis translated messages with spacing shorter than optimal very inefficiently when compared to E. coli translation under analogous manipulations. It was found that the degree of emphasis placed on the initiation codon type and spacing had a profound impact on translation . It was found that the sequence AAA-AAT-AAG-GAG-GAA-AAA-AAA exhibited the highest specific activity (expressed in miller units). Also documented is that in both in vivo"

Background 
Small molecule miRNA is a class of endogenous single-stranded non-coding small RNAs of 21-24 nucleotides in length. miRNA not only plays an important role in the normal development, differentiation and apoptosis of the body, but also participates in the occurrence of various tumors including breast cancer, and regulates the occurrence and development of breast cancer at the microscopic level.
Serum MIRNA can be used as a sensitive marker for breast cancer, and its sensitivity and specificity are higher than the currently widely used carbohydrate antigens. [4] Studies have found that compared with healthy controls, miR-10b, miRNA-145 and miR-155 are up-regulated in the serum of breast cancer patients, and the expression levels of the three miRNAs are significantly correlated with tumor metastasis, but they have no correlation with age, histological features, and ER expression.

The dCas9-VP64-gRNA complex will target the pMLPm synthetic promoter and promote the expression of exogenous reverse caspase3, that in contrast to the endogenous caspas3 will be activated after transcription due to its autocatalytic processing, meaning that this enzyme will trigger an apoptotic signal that will lead to apoptotic death  (caspase3 is responsible for chromatin condensation and DNA fragmentation)3.
The mCherry reporter protein is also expressed by the pMLPm promoter in our system, it is fused to the exogenous reverse caspase3 with Thoseaasigna virus 2A (T2A) peptide that is cleaved during translation4.
In order to activate pMLPm promoter and to induce apoptotic death we used 2 plasmids:
A Lenti viral plasmid: pTIMP1 dCas9 VP64 – in this plasmid TIMP1 promoter expresses dCas9 enzyme which is fused to the transcription factor VP64.
pSynt – in this plasmid pSTEAP4 promoter expresses gRNA and pMLPm promoter regulates the downstream translation of reverse caspase3 which is fused to mCherry fluorophore.
A1 reactive astrocyte cells that were co-transfected with both plasmids will drove apoptosis simultaneously with expression of mCherry. In order to test the specificity of pMLPm promoter activation, we used a control of cells that were transfected only with the pSynt plasmid.
Procedure: 
Day 1-  Splitting of C8-D30-cells to 6 wells plates
Day 2- transfection with TurboFect™ Transfection Reagent
Day 3- We verified mCherry expression with fluorescent microscope (24 hours after transfection).
Day 4:
validation of pMLPm activation with dCas9-VP64-gRNA-
We used ARIA FACS in order to document mCherry expression (48 hours after transfection).
We used confocal microscope in order to document mCherry expression (48 hours after transfection).

We obviously found that the soap of such brand has a relatively weaker antibacterial effect than the other two products. In addition, we use synthetic biology to produce such rose-scented bacteriostat, reducing the burden on the environment and being safer and more friendly to people. Our project may have certain economic benefits.(More details on our Demonstrate page)
Seek input from experts “in the field’
    To ensure that our project would stay on track to tackle real-life problems, we continuously sought into from people specializing in different fields.
Dr. Liu
We also interviewed Dr. Liu. In response to eliminate unpleasant axilla odors, she said in addition to degrading the odorous substance, it can be covered with other fragrances, which is consistent with our idea of using 2-pe to cover up the unpleasant odors.
Dr. Andreas Natsch
To make our project on bromidrosis more comprehensive and get more professional advice, we have got in touch with Dr. Andreas Natsch, who is an expert on the area of bromidrosis and whose literature gave us lots of reference. After reading his literature, we knew about the mechanism of bromidrosis and get the inspiration of constructing degrading enzymes to eliminate the odorant acids, E-3M2H. Then, we sent an E-mail to him, in which we introduced him our approach to bromidrosis and put up some questions we encountered throughout our project. And later we were lucky to hear from him. In his reply, he firstly solved our confusion about the category of the bacteria under axilla and gave us some feedback about our project. He thinks that it’s an innovative way to use bacteria to solve the problem of bromidrosis, and the acceptance level of the public also need to be taken into consideration, and then we designed a questionnaire to evaluate this issue.(Can be found on our investigation above).
Which concentration of 2-PE is the most pleasant ?
    To tackle real-life environmental problems, except for killing harmful bacteria with PLA (phenyllaclic acid), we also want to cover up the unpleasant smell with rose-like fragrance from 2-PE (2-phenylethanol). However, we encountered a problem that because of people’s different perceptions of odor, we don’t know which concentration of 2-PE we produce is the most acceptable for the public. And then we wanted to seek answer from human practice.

Collaborations
Over the course of the last year we had the invaluable opportunity to meet and work with other iGEM teams from all over the world. Through close collaboration we contributed to their projects, got a lot of feedback and received instrumental help for the realization of a malaria-free world. Apart from various surveys, social media challenges, skype meetings, iGEM meetups and especially the following list of our collaborations we got to know so many dedicated students from all around the world. Thank you!
Eindhoven
Bacteria cultures are an established technology for industrial production of complex biological products. Decades of research and development were spent optimizing laboratory and industrial applications designed for highest possible yield. Highly controlled environments were invented: cell shakers and bioreactors provide ideal conditions for bacteria suspension cultures.
In environmental synthetic biology, the situation could not be more different. Cells are supposed to function as designed in uncontrollable environments under varying conditions and no maintenance. If a laboratory cell culture would be left unattended for longer periods of time, cells would overgrow until all substrate is depleted and die. Without shaking, cells would sink to the bottom and form microenvironments with deleterious effects for the desired function.
This issue calls for an innovative solution that allows environmental synthetic biology projects like ours to rely on modified bacteria while still being stable without maintenance. iGEM Eindhoven provides such a solution: They developed a dextran-based gel in which bacteria are immobilized by expression of matrix-adhering membrane proteins. This novel approach of 3D gel-embedded culture ensures even distribution of cells throughout the culture and poses an additional inhibition of bacterial cell growth, complementing our soft growth inhibition Parts. In S.H.I.E.L.D., we employ Eindhoven’s gel as matrix for E. coli. This way, we are confident in sustainability far beyond classic culture technologies could provide in the field.
iGEM Eindhoven developed their gel to be as stable as possible. Despite a desirable attribute for any application, this raises difficulties in characterization: How do you test whether gel-embedded bacteria are still alive and viable? Naturally, you would try to dissolve the gel under conditions embedded bacteria can survive. After their gel proved to be resistant to dextranase, an enzyme specifically for the degradation of dextran, they asked us to try dissolve it"
Paris_Saclay,2014,Team:Paris Saclay#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," As art is accessible to everybody, we believe that this is the best way to reach the general public and allow them to introspect. Our piece will play with the perception of things by recreating a living lemon tree. We use synthetic biology to design a lemon, a bacterial lemon, but that will look like a real one: same smell, same shape and color, and that will slowly change from green to yellow, like a lemon when it ripens. Would you consider our lemon as a fake? Another kind of lemon? This brings us back to our first question on the definition of life, an aspect that we have developed in our Ethics part.
As we use living beings to make art, it raised a lot of other questions: can we modify and/or use living organisms to create a piece of art work? In fact, every time that we debate on this question, within the team or with other iGEMers, scientists or artists, we always arrived at the same critical questions: what is our definition of the living? Do we accept to use every kind of living to do Bio-Art? Is using bacteria the same that as rabbits or humans? And finally the use of Bio-Art nourished our ethical questioning. Art, Science and Ethics are so intricately intertwined.
Food is essential to our lives and is filled with symbolism. With our lemon, we wish that the public will think about future food consumption habits. Is synthetic food the future? Will this lemon be found in your fridge one day?
Video
In a collaboration with iGEM Paris-Bettencourt team in our iGEM French Meeting , we made a video to introduce the project.
Inspirations
The question of living-being's representation reminded us Magritte's work. But our inspirations came from others artistic works. Indeed, the idea of our project is fully referenced. In this section we described how these artists and their concepts help us to build and design our project.
Scientific part
Our project is based on the construction of a bacterial lemon that will look like lemon but made only of Escherichia coli modified to produce a lemon scent and to change colour from green to yellow. We will achieve our project by genetically modifying Escherichia coli to be devoid of any unpleasant odour by deleting the genes involved in E. coli's odor, by introducing  genes for the production of the lemon scent and finally by adding a yellow-blue chromoprotein whose expression is controlled by a tRNA suppressor for the colour switching.

Wellesley_HCI,2012,Team:Wellesley HCI#Notebook#KimberlyChang_-_-_TEXT.html," let users select from a series of colors. I looked at the demo files included from the Sifteo SDK and borrowed code from the Slideshow app. The Slideshow allows users to cycle through a series of images by clicking, but it also included functionality to affect the images on-screen by shaking and connecting cubes to other cubes. I took the events other than the clicking, but was frustrated to discover that the code wouldn’t run, even when I had copy and pasted the exact same code from the demo file.
June 26: I looked at the code I was working on from yesterday, and discovered that the demo file had a “bootstrap” file that include the run command. I created a bootstrap file for my project and was happy to discover that the code now ran smoothly. I then created a new file for the gif animation and took the code for cycling through the frames from the color program and was able to create a moving gif animation on the cubes. I also was able to get a blue square to appear on the screen. This is a placeholder for the ice cubes that we’ll be adding for the cold shock. When Wendy and I met with Orit, Orit discussed using the cubes to interact with the Surface. We had wanted to have the user to simply place the cube down on the surface to deploy the E. coli, but since we needed the cubes to recognize some event, we decided that it might be better for the user to place the cubes face down on the Surface to deploy instead. My next task that Orit assigned to me was to get the animation for the dripping paint.
June 27: I created storyboards for what the dripping animation would look like and how the plasmid cubes would be affected. I didn’t get much done in the way of coding, however.
June 29: We attended a lecture by Walter Lewin at MIT with members of the BU and MIT iGEM teams. Afterwards, we toured MIT’s iGEM and synthetic biology labs.
Week of July 2
July 5: Today, Consuelo told me that Nicole will be helping me with the Sifteo cube programming. I sent Nicole the code that I had so far and walked through what I had and what I still wanted to do. Nicole was able to get the tilting interaction working so that when the cubes have been neighbored and the color cube tilts, the dripping animation on both the color cube and the plasmid cube play. I created images for the different colored drips, but we haven’t yet implemented the code for changing the drip images when the color"
Dalhousie,2017,Team:Dalhousie#DanFalk_-_-_TEXT.html," any tips on how to determine if a popular science article is exaggerating the conclusions from a scientific article? What are the red flags? If you are in any doubt go to the article source. The problem you may discover is that sometimes those sources are behind paywalls or are simply too technical. But as I hinted at with a previous answer, there are other things you can do besides going to the original source. For example, going to other popular media accounts to check their portrayal of the story. If multiple sources are reporting it the same way than that is a strong indication what they are reporting it factually correct. The biggest red flag is when something just sounds wrong. Unfortunately, we all have prejudges towards what we want to believe and therefore you may not just be reading the news but an interpretation of the news. Journalists and science communicators have a responsibility to determine what the facts are and communicate them appropriately."

UN Biodiversity Conference
December 2016
During the COP13, we had the opportunity to talk to delegates, learn from their perspectives, the positions of their countries and share with them what we knew about Synthetic Biology and the advantages of the implementation of these technologies. We even got to share our concerns with Mexico’s Environment Minister.
The Public Research and Regulation Initiative (PRRI) delegation hosted a side event, in which some of the PHAgave team instructors and advisors explained their previous iGEM projects. We also got the chance to share our thoughts in an article written by one of the team members. It was reviewed by Dr Mahaletchumy Arujanan, major science communicator, and published by the Malaysian Biotechnology Information Centre in the Petri Dish, Malaysia’s first science newspaper.
We can say that this experience totally shaped the way we see ourselves as biotechnologists. It made us realize the importance of stepping out of the labs and taking part in decision making, because what people are deciding today will affect our future.

MUSE Bio
MUSE Bio is a local start-up company based in Boulder, CO that uses powerful bioinformatics and novel molecular approaches to generate low-cost libraries of thousands of designer protein, pathway, and genome variants. In teaming up with MUSE Bio, we were able to generate a library of genomic edits for EutS and library of naturally activated EutSMNLK compartments.
CRISPR genome editing
Using the CRISPR based CREATE system designed by MUSE, we were able to extend the edits we were making to our plasmid to the genomic level. We did this by expressing the native EutSMNLK compartment in E. Coli cells by introducing an IPTG inducible promoter and then transforming the cells with two sets of genomic edit libraries, provided by MUSE. The first was a library in which each amino acid was replaced with the every other possible amino acids, one at a time. The second provided library contains the amber stop codon at each codon within the genome. With the special tRNA expressed by the Schultz plasmid, the amber stop codon can actually be used to introduce azobenzene to the compartment. The collaboration with MUSE has allowed the team to extend the range and shorten the time required for adding mutations to our system as well as will yield a comparison of the engineered EutS protein to the native EutSMNLK.
Muse Library Integration
We are hopeful for mutations in the genome that create a successful nano- compartment and may improve the stability of the compartment. Ethanolamine is toxic to the cells and is metabolized in Eut complexes. To test the mutations, the two libraries will be grown on ethanolamine plates, with varying concentrations of ethanolamine. Only mutants that can successfully create the compartment will survive on these plates and, theoretically, the plasmids with a beneficial mutation will be found only on the plates with a high concentration of ethanolamine. To test which mutations survived as well as the frequency of these, we will use high throughput sequencing to verify the mutations and quantify which mutations yielded as successful compartment. These data will provide insight into the location of the genome in which mutations are favorable to form this compartment and set up further research into the use of these mutated compartments.

UNESP Brazil
We collaborated with iGEM UNESP Brazil is working on the subject of Engineered Probiotics Around the World.
The goal of the collaboration was to understand about the GMO legislation around the world and if there already is any regulations about engineered probiotics and if there are clinical trials or companies using engineered probiotics in these countries. This work was done in collaboration with teams Chalmers-Gothenburg, IIT Delhi, Jiangnan China, TecCEM and Lambert. We were grateful that they reached out to us. It was really interesting to learn about probiotics marketed in various countries, high tech startups working in the field of probiotics and recent clinical trials across the world that provide critical insight into a topic that has been of much importance recently. The data from the collaboration is given below,
China
In China, there is no regulation for genetically engineered probiotics, the present tests in the country approach pathogenic potential, and patronized standards for food evaluation. No companies or clinical trials that use engineered probiotics has come to our knowledge.
India
In India, the ICMR (Indian Council of Medical Research) in partnership with DBT (Department of Biotechnology), created an official guide to evaluate probiotics in the country, so any probiotic product needs to be on this guide´s pattern to be released in the market.
Before being approved and released, food is submitted to standardized tests for identification and characterization of its new chains, such as PCR, in vitro tests mimicking the gut environment, in vivo testing to check the effectiveness in live animals, safety assessment for human use, evaluation of efficacy in humans, also there are standards patterns that need to be followed for the process of food packing and management.
Currently, the probiotic market in India is dominated by multinationals, which mainly commercialize fermented food products. No companies or clinical trials that use engineered probiotics has come to our knowledge.
Mexico
In Mexico, all food that has been processed or produced by genetically modified organisms are considered transgenic,"

Concentrating on ideas from different teams, we really enjoyed our time. Strengths and weaknesses, we sometimes saw in ourselves and sometimes from others. Wonderful questions from audiences and judges pointed out how to improve and present our projects in the future, so did advice.
Having experienced a model competition, we owned a chance to view our project as an outsider. And we believe that, we will be much more at ease in the presentation of Asian jamboree.
As for lunchtime, we enjoyed tasty pizzas and talked together. We shared funny stories in this summer and exchanged ideas about different projects as well as teams. Walking around, we viewed posters from each team, and discussed curves, data, even details about materials and test conditions.
Tired but joyful, we will never forget this rewarding model jamboree.

talking with other iGEM team about their project and giving advice
We talked with some members from other iGEM teams. We were interested with their ideas and surprised at their work during summer. China-Tongji iGEM team tried to make nematode light-sensitive, which is an amazing project we thought. However, we suggested that although scientists had created light-sensitive mouse, it was a challenge to let nematode express light-sensitive proteins. Also, we mentioned ethic issues and safety for China-Tongji. ZJU-China team made a funny biological playing card. This bio-card could help student learn many knowledge of synbio. We advised them make the biocard easy-understanding and design more detail information so that public could accept it rather than only biology student. NUY-Shanghai did a fantastic project, they were not limited in synbio but used knowledge and technologies of multiple subjects including engineering, computer science and VR. We learned a lot from what them did and managed to improve our project display. We planned to use LEGO to show our genetic circuit and ribosome meter, thus this presentation would be easy to understand and participate for public.  Furthermore, we started to cooperate with them after the workshop. We provided several biobricks for them to support they finish their project.

Public presentation
One of the most important tasks in iGEM competition is human practice. This part is aimed to let more people in different societies know about synbio and iGEM, also give us a change to change the world.  We contributed many efforts to this part and we believed we could make influence on our world. During the workshop, we explained every detail on our project to a museum staff and she presented all projects on the museum website for online visitors. Furthermore, we introduced our project to many visitors. They usually did not have any biological background, thereby we used the simplest way to introduce synthetic biology and show our project. After that, all the visitors understood and felt interested in what we did. Additionally, we gave an academic presentation to an expert from Fudan University. He was very integrated to the ribosome meter and he predicted this technology would have a huge application. During workshop, we surprisingly found that a little child was able to participate in the exhibition of NUY-Shanghai. Giving some educations to next generation may the best thing in this competition, which is our responsibility to influence the world and the further.

Is it possible to preserve foods by Flavorator?
We experimented  preserving food by fragrance with antimicrobial activity. Fig. 4 is preservation of pork by garlic, and Fig. 5 is preservation of bread by geraniol. The mashed garlic and geraniol releases fragrant substances that has antimicrobial activity.
From these result, we considered that foods can be preserved in Flavorator if our recombinants release a large amount of fragrance.

High copy number RBS characterizations are rarely indicative of RiPS in system operation plasmids, thus we are planning to also measure the fluorescence assays with the BioBricks on pSB3C5. In order to obtain sufficient BioBrick DNA the strains were grown in 250 mL LB with 100 μg/mL Ampicillin, awaiting plasmid isolation and plasmid swapping.

Introduction
iGEM is all about synthetic biology and pushing the boundaries of the field to meet the needs of today with innovative solutions, and the spirit of iGEM has always been collaborative. We believe in adopting that spirit in our project.
It was important for us to collaborate with multiple research groups working on synthetic biology and cancer therapeutics during the course of our project. Our interactions with them were vital in the development of our project and we learned                 a lot from their input that allowed us to adapt and improve our project, shaping CAPOEIRA to meet the needs of the relevant stakeholders in the field. We have elaborated our story on our ‘Integrated Human Practices Page
Equally important to our project was collaboration with other iGEM teams. We were able to team up with teams around the globe on a variety of experiments that contributed to the mutual understanding and improvement of projects, exploring                 the ethical and regulatory landscape of a number of countries regarding synthetic biology as well as giving and receiving feedback where we can on the wiki, project, poster, presentation and other aspects of iGEM projects of our collaborators                 and of our own.

Once made up in quantity, the diet is not sterilised at this stage, but used to fill 75 mm x 25 mm diameter tubes which are then deep frozen. The diet is sterilised at the point of making up large numbers of Parafilm sachets on the end of 25mm x25mm diam. plastic tubes, which are then again deep frozen till required. Thawed diet in a syringe passes through a sterilised bacterial filter (Fig. 1, A) and dispensed onto a square of Parafilm stretched over the end of a tube. This Parafilm is then covered with another stretched square (Fig. 1, B) and the projecting Parafilm smoothed down onto the side of the tube. All this is done in a laminar flow cabinet, where the Parafilm squares are first surface-sterilised with UV light. In making the sachets, care has to be taken that it is the sterile upper surfaces of the Parafilm squares that enclose the diet. The sachets now have to be changed for new ones every 2-3days to prevent microbial contamination and the loss of vitamins (particularly ascorbic acid).

OVERVIEW
ATTRACT
Mosquito Repellent
Our idea of a mosquito repellent aims to neutralize the odours that mosquitoes are attracted to. Recent studies have shown that mosquitoes infected with the malarial parasite, Plasmodium falciparum, are four times more attracted to foot odour than non-infected mosquitoes. By removing the volatile compounds that cause these smells, we hypothesize that this will effectively decrease the ability of mosquitoes to find humans. Our project thus focuses on creating a genetic and enzymatic pathway to remove those volatile compounds. It begins with the uptake of isovaleric acid, a known mosquito semiochemical that is present is foot odour, and converts it into banana smell. Domestically, this serves as a foot deodorant but on a global scale it may also curb malaria infection rates.
AtoE
AtoE is a non-specific membrane transporter of short-chain fatty acids endogenously expressed in ''E.coli''. High constitutive expression of this gene would allow high intake of surrounding isovaleric acid and channelling into the breakdown pathway.
In order to isolate the gene from the E. coli genome, we designed PCR primers so that the AtoE gene could be replicated with the correct biobrick prefix and suffix. The size of the AtoE gene is 1323 bp, but with the addition of the standard biobrick cut sites (43bp), a 1.4kb band was expected and was seen on the gel of the PCR products (on right).
NCAR and NPT
Carboxylic acid reductase (CAR) and phosphopantetheinyl transferase (NPT) are endogenously expressed in Nocardia iowensis. NCAR is a highly non-specific carboxylic acid reductase that converts fatty acids such as isovaleric acid into aldehydes. NPT is an enzyme that induces a post-translational modification by adding a pantetheinyl arm to the active site of the carboxylic"

Design of Mag-Nano-Tite Biobrick device
It was decided by the team that MamO; MamP; MamX; MamT should all feature on this ultimate device as each gene codes proteins which we believe to be crucial for magnetite nanoparticle formation. MamO is involved in nucleation of magnetite biomineralization therefore serves a crucial role. MamP/X/T have been proposed to be cytochrome proteins which are thought to work together in the biomineralization process of magnetite within magnetotactic bacteria. As such, this ultimate device features all four said Mam genes in a single plasmid which will enabled us to execute in vivo experiments in E. coli pSB1A3+[AraC-pBAD]+MamOPXT device for In Vivo experiments  was constructed by firstly ligating AraC-pBAD promoter ( Imperial College 2014: BBa_K1321333 ) into pSB1A3 vector.

ABSTRACT
One of the main ambitions of Plant SynBio is to ensure a future sustainable agriculture by increasing food production and promoting seasonless proximity products. To achieve this goal, having complete control over plant development is decisive. ChatterPlant helps in this commitment by developing an integrated orthogonal interface between plants and humans.
Bearing that in mind, two genetic circuits were engineered. The first one contains an optogenetic switch allowing us to intervene in the plant development by regulating its genetic profile. The second one consists of a color code sensor circuit that flags the presence of specific plant stresses. This color code circuit contains different AND gates triggered by recombinase actuation together with different plant-specific inducible promoters. Furthermore, viral vectors were implemented in both circuits to amplify output signal. Finally, all Phytobricks built in this project can be reused in novel plant genetic circuits, thus contributing to Plant SynBio progress.
INTRODUCTION
Plant Synthetic Biology is a novel interdisciplinary field that offers the pathway to design and alter natural systems in order to achieve plants’ predictable behaviours. This novel field aims to play an essential role in future agriculture by enhancing food production or increasing food nutritional quality.
Therefore, one of their greater ambitions is producing plants with customized functionality through the design of genetic devices. For that purpose, two concepts should be considered. First, the engineering principles (Modularity, abstraction, standardization and orthogonality) must be applied to facilitate the design of new biological devices or Phytobricks. Second, an exhaustive characterization is necessary in order to predict the behaviour of plant genetic devices.
ChatterPlant follows SynBio principles to design, develop and implement plant genetic devices, which help in the commitment of creating a brand-new more sustainable agriculture. Furthermore, these devices have been generated following SynBio principles by using standard and modular approaches, thus generating genetic tools not only for ChatterPlant but for any future Plant SynBio project.
PLANT CHASSIS
Bacterial systems were the"
Uppsala,2018,Team:Uppsala#99_-_-_TEXT.html," and induce the formation of blood clots. When a small blood clot forms, it may form an embolism, which can detach and travel in the bloodstream until it reaches and blocks smaller blood vessels. This prevents oxygen and nutrient supply to surrounding tissues and may result in colic[14]. This can cause problems in the animals, with the worst case scenario being death[4].
Having these parasites is obviously a huge problem and there is great need for methods that can detect the parasites before ingestion, preventing infection.
Methods for Detection
To be able to count either small or large strongyles, the current methods require growing their eggs from samples and counting them.  The disadvantage is that this method only works for adult strongyles that have already laid eggs! This technique only makes it possible to detect strongyles after the infection which is a huge disadvantage! Other methods for detection, such as using an ELISA test or a PCR based method are expensive and require a high level of expertise [12, 13, 17].
What is currently needed is a simple detection method which could be used on site without specialised equipment. To fulfil this need we aim to develop a detection method that can be applied to pastures in order to prevent infection to begin with!
Preventing an Infection
After infestation, the window of opportunity for treatment is comparatively small, as the large strongyle spends most of its life cycle in the blood stream, where the treatment is ineffective. It is therefore important for the farmer to know what levels of infestation are present in the pastures and whether these are safe for their animals to graze on. We aim to develop a tool which allows quantitative measurement of such infestation of pastures, which would decrease the occurrence of infection.
Creating the Worm Buster
A step by step guide
How will we achieve this?
The first thing is to define the desired characteristics of each worm buster. To face the problem the team need to develop bacteria with two different functions. The two different bacteria we will be described below
First Method
The Small Worm Buster
One method is to engineer a bacteria that lives in the intestinal tracts of horses and report a quantitative signal of small strongyle in feces. The small strongyle buster can therefore work as a diagnostic tool and give horse owners the possibility to use individualized dosage of treatment                                  depending on the level of small strongyle infection.
Bacteria 2
The Large Worm Buster
Another method is to engineer a bacteria that can be applied to pasture samples and report the amount of large strongyles in pastures. By detecting large strongyles in pasture the large strongyle"

Our parts collection is designed to make up a device for targeting any specific pathogen wanted using our osmY-hfq fusion biobrick to secrete our siRNA biobrick out of E. coli. Fusing Hfq with OsmY meant we could have it bind with the siRNA expression system we designed (expression system contains micC sequence for binding with Hfq from E. coli and chiA for binding with Hfq from Serratia marcescens). Using a simple PCR method a targeting sequence can be added to spiRNA specific to the gene of your choice. Using this in tandem with our OsmY-Hfq fusion proteins allows future users to use our system in a variety of other settings."

20% w/v dope extruded into 70% ethanol succeeded
nominal extrusion rate of 16 uL/min
I say nominal because the screw drive clearly isn’t advancing
I see now why professional fiber spinners use piston pressure instead of a drive screw syringe pump
I had to pull the coagulating mass out of the way of the dope that was continuing to advance out of the PEEK tubing
hence, at some points the fiber is thinner (but still intact)
nevertheless, even without pulling on the dope, a fiber would still form right out of the tubing
Some confounding variables:
I have no idea what pressure the pump is applying to the syringe since the drive block is not moving at all
Time may be a variable: this had been pumping for a long time before this particular experiment. Maybe all of the air bubbles from yesterday have already been purged?
Things to take care of next:
construct a robust set up where dope coming out of the tube will have adequate space so that it doesn’t hinder the dope coming out of the peek tubing
try it on silk!
construct a post-spin stretch system. This will alleviate the problem of coagulated dope interfering with dope that’s still coming out
additionally, we’ll need to have this set up anyway for silk
Once again, tried 20% w/v dope extruded into 70% ethanol, this time with the syringe pump oriented vertically
gravity pulled already forming fibers out of the way, allowing fibers to continue to form."
Tec-Chihuahua,2018,Team:Tec-Chihuahua#Public Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html,". Saúl commented to his mentor, Ph.D. María Mercedes Roca, that we wanted to participate in this collaboration and she invited us to cooperate to their work.
The ERA for GMOs is a completely independent project written by biotechnology experts being Ph.D. María Mercedes Roca, Ph.D. Paulo Paes de Andrade, Ph.D. Wayne Parrott, and MSc. Robert McDowell the principal editors of this second edition.
This initiative began due to Article 15 on the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety to the Convention on Biological Diversity. The Convention on Biological Diversity entered into force on December 29th, 1993 and nowadays its the most important international instrument for addressing biodiversity issues by providing a comprehensive approach to the conservation of biological diversity. One of the issues that the Convention addresses is biosafety. Article 15 states that risk assessments should be carried out in a scientifically sound manner and mentions its specifications in Annex III on this Protocol. According to the Annex III:
Objective of making a Risk Assessment
Identify and evaluate how likely is a GMO able to have adverse effects on the conservation of biological diversity and human health.
Use of Risk Assessment
The risk assessment (RA) is used by authorities to make informed decisions about living modified organisms.
General principles
RA should be transparent and can take advice from relevant international organizations. Every case is different, therefore the RA should be done on a case-by-case basis.
Methodology
Identification of any genotypic and phenotypic characteristics related to the GMO that may have adverse effects on biological diversity and/or human’s health.
Evaluation of the probability of the adverse effects the GMO could provoke.
Evaluation of the consequences of the adverse effects the GMO could provoke.
Estimation of the overall risk that GMO would have based on the probability and consequences of the adverse effects.
Recommendation as to whether the risks are acceptable or manageable.
If they are manageable, identification of strategies to manage those risks.
Requesting further information if there is uncertainty or implementing appropriate risk management strategies, as well as monitoring the GMO in the environment.
Points to consider
It is important to take into account scientific information of the parental organisms, organisms, characteristics of the vector, genetic characteristics of the inserted DNA and/or characteristics of the modification introduced, detection of the GMO, information of the intended use of that GMO and information of the receiving environment.
Based on Annex III of Article 15 on the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety to the Convention on Biological Diversity, the editors wrote the second edition of the Environmental Risk Assessment Guide and iGEM Tec-Chihuahua was able to help with the English"
