Evry,2012,Team:Evry#GB_-_-_TEXT.html," methodology we have tried in this work to stay as close as possible to the biobrick format, to keep GoldenBrick parts compatible with the RFC 10 standard assembly, while opening new perspectives to increase the speed and the easiness of cloning. These constraints imposed several requirements for this new standard.
First, the new assembly method should:
Keep the compatibility with the current BBF RFC 10 standard
Be compatible with a database approach
Minimize the number of different prefixes and suffixes
Use the standard registry plasmids and negative cloning control
To improve the cloning speed, we would also like to:
Make one step Golden Gate cassette cloning possible
Allow to check the construct with a single enzyme digestion
Improve the compatibility with Gibson by removing the NotI site
Provide a solution for non standard assemblies
As we will demonstrate, the GoldenBrick format we have established meet all these requirements. To understand on what basis we have created it, we are now going to explain in this section the principles that led the design of this format before we analyze the sequences of the GoldenBrick prefixes and suffixes and finally discuss what can be done with this technique.
A brief introduction on type II restriction enzymes
Golden Gate cloning, (also known as type II restriction enzyme cloning) rely on a specific familly of enzyme (known as the type IIS enzymes) very different from the ones we are used to. The characteristic of type IIS enzymes from the cloning point of view is that these enzymes cut the DNA outside their recognition locus, no matter the sequence of the place where they cut. A very small subtype of them can be used for cloning purpose, since they generate overhangs on one side of the recognition site only. The ones used for Golden Gate and MoClo cloning are BsaI and BbsI.
Fig 2: The recognition pattern of BsaI and cutting site.
The fact that these enzymes cut outside its recognition site gives them two significant advantages:
You can generate as many different overhang you want with a single enzyme within the same tube
You can engineer your fragment so that it cannot be cutted again after it has ligated.
Thanks to this last point, it is possible to cut and ligate the DNA in the mean time within the same tube (BsaI works in the T4 ligase buffer), and do not require any DNA purification. For this reason, the ligation is achieved with a better yield and with less mutation than with traditional type II enzymes cloning methods.

Production of liquid crystal cell
The treated upper and lower slides were assembled face to face, and the slides were separated                             by                             Mylar polyester sheets (intermediate open convex cavity), and the other three sides were                             fixed                             with small clips except for the opening direction. A small amount of liquid crystal is                             injected                             into the liquid crystal cell from the opening by capillary action, and the liquid crystal is                             filled with the entire cavity, and then observed by a polarizing microscope. And record the                             image results.
Optimization of Experimental Conditions
Explore the appropriate antibody concentration
Time:
20 July: Antibody concentration 50ng/ml. Antibody concentration 200ng/ml.
21 July: Antibody concentration 500ng/ml. Antibody concentration 1000ng/ml.
30 July: Antibody concentration 1ng/ml. Antibody concentration 10ng/ml. Antibody                                 concentration 50ng/ml.
Since the antibody itself has a corresponding perturbation effect on the liquid crystal, in                             order                             to avoid the influence of the nano-antibody perturbation effect on the experimental results,                             we                             carried out an experiment to determine the appropriate concentration of the antibody, and we                             selected 50 ng/mL, 500 ng/mL, 1000 ng/mL, 2000 ng/mL antibody respectively. The                             concentration                             was tested and three parallel experimental groups were set for each concentration. Parallel                             light and conical light were used for observation. The parallel light observation results                             (Fig.                             1) were all black, indicating that the liquid crystal remained vertical.
Parallel light observations at 50 ng/mL, 200 ng/mL, 500 ng/mL and 1000                             ng/mL
Figure 1 Effect of antigen concentration gradient on liquid crystal                             alignment
Since the experimental results did not result in antibody concentrations that caused the                             liquid                             crystals to align in parallel and cause color changes, we continued to increase the                             concentration for experiments. Experiments were performed at 1 ng/mL and 10 ng/mL to obtain                             the                             results of parallel light.

We made a PCR of the pSB4A5 and the pSB1C3 backbones. These were purified, but the purified products were not run on a gel as we didn’t have the time.
Finally, O/N cultures of the restreaks from yesterday were done. 23 in total. Three of the restreaks containing pSB4A5 and GFP were red, and as they are not supposed to be that, these were of course not included in the O/N’s. Tomorrow minipreps of the O/N’s  and a PCR can be done, and then we will hopefully know whether we have some constructs that are ready for measurements.

XMU-China,2013,Team:XMU-China#Content mechanism_-_-_TEXT.html,"-5 Plasmids A, B and C in oscillation circuit
You may have noticed that these three plasmids have different resistant genes and replication origins on their backbone. Different resistant genes are used mainly for selection. And since different replication origin means a different copy number of target genes in this plasmid. Using different replication origins is to produce different target proteins in an appropriate ratio, and only in this way can oscillation be observed. Just like a glee needs Soprano, Tenor and Bass to cooperate to finish a song. Besides, three artificial plasmids with same copy numbers always have a competitive relation in one cell and cannot be well expressed.
Plasmid A has two different backbones with high and middle copy numbers respectively. We built them to see the copy numbers' effect on oscillation. Results can be seen in Exploration (For a better Glee).
All of the plasmids we constructed are confirmed by agarose gel electrophoresis, and result can be seen in Parts , where you can also get the link to parts we submitted.
After the onerous construction work, our glee is ready to perform the synchronized oscillation song, so we have to find them a stage. Let's go to see the beautiful opera in Microfluidics (Stages) .

TUST_China,2018,Team:TUST China#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," took the first step in high schools.
We listened to experts and contacted several high school in Tianjin. Teachers warmly welcome us to do and explain experiments for students. We went and met other teams there, we cooperated tightly for presenting a wonderful schedule containing: the concept of synthetic biology and its influence in reality, introduction of classic             iGEM projects and example of our programs, non-toxic yeasts which showed different colors.
To our great surprise, we received countless fans of synthetic biology and they showed great passion about the amazing field. They listened carefully and asked questions actively. Afterwards, we introduced to them how to build a team and what is essential for team-building, they were really excited and couldnt help to join in the IGEM club. The energetic and creative thoughts provided us valuable inspiration about our             program. It was our pleasure to expose them to shallow biology research.

Beijing-Tianjin Alliance Building
In early September, TUST-China met with UCAS-China, helped UCAS-China successfully hold the first iGEM Six-School Exchange Forum and established the Beijing-Tianjin iGEM Alliance (TUST-China is the co-founder of the alliance). The forum attracted six iGEM teams from Beijing and Tianjin, including UCAS-China, Tsinghua, BNU-China, TJU-China, NKU-China and TUST-China. At this forum, we participated in a round table to exchange our projects between the teams of the Beijing Tianjin IGEM Alliance. At the meeting, each group put forward the assessment plan which is expected to be completed at present, hoping to better share and assess the iGEM resources of universities in Beijing and Tianjin by forming an alliance, and to host next year's National Popular Science Day on this platform. In the process of project communication,             we are very grateful to Tsinghua University and UCAS-China for their many suggestions.

This summer holiday, we went to the Tianjin Center for Disease and Prevention for visiting and learning. They introduced their laboratories and main devices for us, telling us the basic rules and regulations about the experiments. We learned a lot from their introduction, after visiting, we shared our projects to them. Surprisingly, them highly appreciate it and said “Exactly, tetracycline residue in water and soil is serious and acute, it is not easy for us to test and measure it in samples, this project is very promising and it will definitely advance the science and technology in this sector”. Meanwhile, they made some instructive suggestions to our project so that it"
UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," vector X=(Conc, Conb)
Take this back into the differential equation, after simplify, get
Solve this set of equation, where C1, C2 is determined by the initial condition of the system.
Therefore, any system with specific initial condition could be settled. If we clear t out of the set of equation, we get the functions of the curves in the graph above.
Now consider what have been put aside in previous discussion.
Conc and Conb have their definition domains, let them respectively be [0,ConcMax]and [0,ConbMax]. This gives a limit to the possible state the systems can evolve. In other word, it limits the system inside a square frame.
As is supported by the experimental data, at the beginning stage of experiment with high environmental ammonium concentration, the gene circuit remains closed. Thus, we can consider Conc is small at this stage. The initial point of the system falls above L1.
From the graph, we can easily find the system confines Conc at a low level at the beginning stage of experiment. This explained why there is no GFP produced at the beginning of experiment.
On the other side, parameters x0, y0 cause the whole system to perform a spatial translation. In any timepoint, x0, y0 give the velocity of the motion. According to y0’s definition, the translation in Conb direction at any time always equals y0 multiplies the change of PII by that time. y0 is negative and significantly bigger than x0.
As the experiment proceeds, the environmental ammonium concentration decreases and the concentration of PII decreases together. The phase flow graph of our system gradually rises up and conduct a constant small translation in Conb direction. There is a special time when the concentration of PII reaches a threshold that the point of our system falls below L1 and L2. Therefore, the system evolves to maximize the Conc. That is when the promoter begins to function and this is the delay time we used as signal in our project.
After that point, the graph keeps rising, the Conc consequently keeps increasing. Thus, the promoter strength keeps increases over time and the reaction goes on for certain time.
In a nutshell, we simplify the gene circuits as a TCS and furtherly construct a differential equation describing the evolving law of this system. To solve this equation, we apply methods from studies of dynamic system. From detailed analysis, we prove that the delay time is a principally reasonable characteristic signal for this reaction. With experimental data supported, the delay time could be used as a special mark for both the promoter and the"

We also took note that the microbe was GRAS (Generally Recognized as Safe) designated by the FDA (Federal Drug Administration) since we plan to use it for producing a food additive. We considered several different microbes, among them were: Lactobacillus florum, Oenococcus oeni, Aspergillus niger, and Bacillus subtilis. L. florum, O. oeni, and A. niger all naturally produce erythritol, while B. subtilis was very well studied and has been used in metabolic engineering many times by previous iGEM teams. While B. subtilis is usually a sporulating organism, we were able to obtain a mutant strain that is non sporulating from the UC Davis iGEM team called 3NA. Sporulation could potentially contaminate the bioreactor and cause problems with filtration. B. subtilis also naturally produces erythrose-4-phosphate, the appropriate precursor for our ideal engineered erythritol production pathway. B. subtilis is also used in large scale industry, a potential application of our erythritol production system.  Keeping in mind that we have only a limited time to complete this project, we chose B. subtilis because we were the most confident that we could successfully engineer it to produce erythritol in that time frame. The B. subtilis strains that we received from the UC Davis iGEM team and used for our project were named PY79 and 3NA, these strains are wildtype, and non – sporulating respectively.
Plasmids:
The plasmid used to assemble our gene insertion construct was pBS1C. This plasmid is a common choice for synthetic biology with B. subtilis (see: The Bacillus BioBrick Box: generation and evaluation of essential genetic building blocks for standardized work with Bacillus subtilis). The plasmid is replicative in E. coli, and integrative into the B. subtilis genome.  Within this integrative portion lies a biobrick gene cassette containing an RFP insert encased in a biobrick prefix and suffix, followed by chloramphenicol resistance. The vector also encodes ampicillin resistance outside of the integration site, for selection in E. coli. The biobrick plasmid design created an optimal system for insertion of our plasmid into B. subtilis. The RFP can be removed and replaced with our gene insertions, allowing an additional layer of screening for successful"

4. Quantitative analysis for cytokinin by bioassay
Before constructing genetic parts for cytokinin synthesis, we learned methods for quantitative analysis for cytokinin through a bioassay of cucumber seed sprouts (Fletcher et al., 1971; Porra et al., 1989) and through using ultra-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC).
In our bioassay of cucumber seed sprouts, we learned how to detect cytokinin and found which concentration of cytokinin can act on plants.  We planted the seeds and germinated for 5 days.  Then, we cultivated the sprouts in standard cytokinin sample solutions.  After 24 hours in the dark and 24 hours in the light, we measured the weight of the sprouts and also homogenized them to measure the concentration of chlorophyll (Fig. 2-3-12).  Fig. 2-3-11 shows the result that the sprouts in the cytokinin solution are larger and greener than the negative controls, which are the sprouts in the solution without cytokinin. The quantitative results (Fig. 2-3-13 and Fig. 2-3-14) also show that cytokinin increases the weight of the sprouts and the concentration of chlorophyll (iP, tZ are both sorts of cytokinin). To know more about this assay, please see here .

BBa_K363008 and BBa_K363009
The voltage-gated calcium channels of S. cerevisiae.
The channels, Mid1 and Cch1, are used implicitly throughout the project, as they are the primary mechanism of voltage sensitivity in S. cerevisiae.  These channels were used by both our team and by Valencia in 2009.  Valencia posted null mutants of these genes in 2009, but we thought that it would be useful to have the wild-type sequences in the registry.
BBa_K363010, BBa_K363011, and BBa_K363012
The calcium stress response system in S. cerevisiae.
These genes, Crz1, Cna1, and Cnb1, are used implicitly throughout our project, as this is the machinery that yeast use to respond to their intrinsic calcium sensitivity.  Cna1 is the catalytic subunit of calcineurin, and Cnb1 is the regulatory subunit of calcineurin.  This protein phosphatase acts on Crz1 in the presence of calcium.  Crz1 is a widely acting transcription factor that binds to a conserved binding site in the yeast genome (see parts BBa_K363001-BBa_K363007).

Mingdao,2017,Team:Mingdao#Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html," examination do we need to go through if we are to commercialize our product? 
FDA: If it is positioned to a kind of common food, it won’t be required to pass any examination procedures. But, if you are to make it a health food warranted by the government, it is necessary that you pass the inspections on food additions and ingredients. The list of ingredients that could be added is now available on the internet. Manufactures are required to hand in their examine result themselves. 
We: If we are now planning to quantify our products in the form of pills, do they have to be examined?
FDA: Sure. Everything should stick to the Standards for Specification, Scope, Application and Limitation of Food Additives.
We: Is there now any regulation related to GMO products?
FDA: For GMO products are generally related to GMO plants, there is still no fine institution for GMO microorganisms. Moreover, we have not yet received any application for this. But, if this really happen, we will ask the applicants to hand in the microorganism’s DNA strands they use. We will test whether any toxic substances or allergens is produced. 
We: So, is it true to say that the limitations keep GMO products from prevailing in Taiwan?
FDA: This is considered a topic of personal view. The governing departments stand on neither side in a controversial topic. But, we’ll be sure that customers have the right to know whether it is a GMO product.
We: So, what kind of data is required?
FDA: First, the effect of the product must be testified. Also, we will ask for the descriptive data about the bacterial strain, how you grow and preserve them, how you rebuilt its DNA, and whether any toxic or allergic reaction is found.
We: Is it an offence if we just make an allegation that our product is of health-giving properties?
FDA: If your product is added to medicines, you may violate the Pharmaceutical Affairs Act. If you claim that your product is of medical effects, you could end up in prison.
We: If we get the permission of commercializing health supplements, will there be an expiration date?
FDA: 5 years. If after 5 years, a new regulation is enacted, and the standard is adjusted, we will examine the product with the new standard again.
We: Is it necessary that we conduct human clinical trial?
FDA: Either in vitro or in vivo trial is acceptable. But, if your product is related to hypertension, than it will be better if you can conduct human clinical trial. Moreover, items should be labeled if it has been done with animal"

We so chose to procee d with further annealing with the Q5 High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase (by New England Biolabs ) as the bands were clearly sharper in the gel as well as the transformation efficiency was seemingly higher.

Exonucleases
In the cloning strain of E. coli, the exonuclease EndA was knocked out. This is very important for such a strain, otherwise the exonucleases degrade the DNA to be transformed. EndA makes double-strand breaks in duplex DNA und is the most abundant DNase activity in E. coli (Dürwaldet al.1968) . In the present of the exonuclease no colonies were formed during transformation (Kanekoet al.2010) . It was recognized that by only the complete loss of host endA there were no degradation after 30h at 39°C. In addition, it was also found out that it creates a structural stability to give transformants and that higher molecular weight genomic DNA bands were recovered from the supernatant and it leads to certain discrete bands in digestion (Itayaet al.2012) . V. cholerae has two extracellular nucleases: Xds and Dns. The Dns is homologous to EndA from E. coli. Both proteins have been shown to be secreted into the medium. These two would degrade the free DNA, which is the source of a natural transformation. Because of this the method would not work or work very poorly. To enable the uptake of intact DNA during the competency process, the functions would have to be extinguished. It was shown that when you delete the nucleases, the transformation process works well. In a mutant in which the dns was knocked out, transformation frequency is more than hundred times higher than WT and when xds was knocked out the transformation frequency was 2,5-fold increased. This result showed that it is good if both nucleases are knocked out, but that the dns is the most important one (Itayaet al.2012) . In addition, you get through the deletion of the two nucleases a cleaner preparations of DNA. We wanted our cloning strain to have all the benefits, so it was very important to us that the exonucleases be knocked out. Otherwise, transformation efficiency would be very low and you don´t get clear preparations of DNA and that would not be great for a cloning strain. We started by searching for homologous genes of endA of E. coli and dns and xds of V. cholera. We were able to find out by blast analysis that in Vibrio natriegens there are two exonucleases homologous to those of E. coli and V. cholera. They are called Dns and Exe"

Characterization of the plasmids 1 and 2 by fluorescence experiments
Results
The first results obtained were the successful assemblies of the plasmids 1 ( K175046 ) and 2 ( K175047 ) (see the plan ). The biobricks were electroporated into Escherichia coli TOP10 cells (see protocols ). Besides, The samples were sent as miniprep DNA to sequence; with this it was possible to confirm the presence of the last part of the biobricks (RBS ( B0034 ) + GFP ( E0040 ) + Terminator ( B0015 )). Further investigation on the sequence should be done.
250 µL of the E. coli TOP10 cells carrying either the plasmid 1 or 2 were plated in an LB agar Petri dish adding the proper selection antibiotic and incubated at 37ºC overnight. The colonies in the plate for plasmid 1 showed red fluorescence and the colonies in the plate for plasmid 2 showed green fluorescence (data not shown). These results were in agreement with the expected fluorescence, Ptet ( R0040 ) acts as a constitutive promoter in the absence of its repressor TetR ( C0040 ), therefore, the production of cI ( C0051 ) and RFP ( E1010 ) was present in the cells. Similar explanation could be used for the interpretation of the green glow in plasmid 2.
The delay-device is formed by the two plasmids. Therefore, both plasmids were introduced into the TOP10 cells, followed by plating and culturing them using the same conditions mentioned above. In this case, the plates and culture tubes were glowing red, which is in"

iGEM UND SYNTHETISCHE BIOLOGIE
Der International Genetically Engineered Machine competition(iGEM) ist ein weltweiter Wettbewerb im Bereich Synthetische Biologie, dessen Zielgruppe hauptsächlich Studenten sind. Er wird von der iGEM Foundation in Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA organisiert.
iGEM entwickelte sich aus Studentenprojekten, die während der ,,Independent Activities Period’’ des MIT in den Jahren 2003 und 2004 geführt wurden.
Später, im Jahre 2004 wurde ein Wettbewerb mit fünf teilnehmenden Teams aus unterschiedlichen Universitäten veranstaltet. Im Jahr 2005 beteiligten sich erstmals Teams von auβerhalb der Vereinigten Staaten an dem Wettbewerb.   Seitdem wächst iGEM immer weiter und besteht momentan aus rund 130 Mannschaften. Am Sommeranfang erhalten Studententeams einen Bausatz mit verschiedenen biologischen Bausteinen von der Registry of Standard Biological parts. Studenten verwenden diese und neue Bausteine an ihrer eigenen Universität über den Sommer um neue, selbstentworfene biologische Systeme zu ertellen und um diese später einer lebenden Zelle transmorfmieren.

We cutchecked our plasmid DNAs that we got from our isolation for controlling of cloning second time with using BamHI and XhoI restriction enzymes.
WESTERN BLOTTING
After we cloned our genes to pET-45b vector successfully then we did Western-Bloting for showing our proteins are synthesized with using the His-tag on the N-terminal of our proteins
SOFT AGAR PLUG ASSAY
For understanding that our proteins that produced are functional or not, we performed a chemotaxis motility assay which is called Agar Plug Assay.
We chose 2 different points on the soft agars that have 2 cm distance between them.We put the filter paper that is immersed in specially prepared liquid culture on the first point and then we put another filter paper that immersed in 0.2 mM HCL solution on the second point. Then we incubated our bacteria on 30C and examined their growing process on plates
The results are below
Increased Motility
In this section, the basic goal of the parts that we are using is to ensure that E. Coli can move from the acidic pH of the stomach fluid into the basic pH of the thick mucus layer and be able to move around within this area with ease. In this manner, the bacteria will have reached the region of the stomach where Helicobacter pylori is found. . Unlike normal fluids, the mucus layer is very thick and the flagella of natural E. Coli does not have sufficient torque or speed to allow it to enter.. In this project, we aim to give E. Coli the ability to enter the stomach’s mucus layer by increasing both of these characteristics. In order to achieve this goal, we plan to use 2 different strategies. . First, we will use a knock-out mutant form (HNS T108I) of the NHS transcription factor found in E. Coli.  This mutant form has been shown to have a positive effect on the speed and torque of the flagella. The difference between the normal NHS and mutant NHS is a single amino acid change from threonine to isoleucine at residue 108 of the protein.
As for the second strategy to reach this goal, we aim to increase the torque power and flagellar speed by replacing the MotA and MotB proteins which make up E. Coli’s rotor (they form a H+ channel) with proteins PotB"

This year, our team’s human practice project focused on qualitative study of stakeholders' perceptions through interviews. The shortlisted stakeholders were asked about the application microbial biosensor in their fields, instead of quantitative study through questionnaire.
Farmers mentioned the possibilities of suffering from deficiency diseases; however, the possibility is slim with their good managements and following the principles of sustainability. Additionally, some mentioned the invasion of pests, such as fruit flies. However, since this is not one of the objectives in our research, no follow-up questions were asked.
I'm sorry to tell you we don't have professionals specialised in laws and regulations in HK in our team. We believed farmers are protected by local laws for any loss due to extreme weather or urban development. 
Ordinance, was set up by HKSAR govt, which forbids any deliberate release of GMO, except, with government approval. Further information can be directed to HKSAR Agricultural, Fisheries and Conservation Dept. The applications of artificial pesticides have to be registered and approved by HKSAR. The corresponding dept will be Agricultural, Fisheries and Conservation Dept. and the Centre for Food and Safety. Since our focus is not on the application of the pesticides, we don't have further comments on the policies and laws on it. Nevertheless, local farmers seldom use chemical pesticides, because of our excellent geographical location. And most farmers rely on traditional method to kill pests, e.g. fruit flies, to protect pre-mature fruits, e.g. papaya, from damages.
——HKUST-Rice
According to the communication through e-mails, we have found that almost each team has done some surveys about laws and regulations of bio-safety and peasants’ right protecting. But every team has its focus on their programs, so not every team gets a thorough understanding about the law and regulation about bio-safety and peasants’ right protection. According to the results we got from our surveys, we found that the public don’t know the laws and regulations about this area very well. And the replays from other teams verified our finding.
In our opinion, if we want to design an experiment, especially an experiment about sensitive social issues, we should firstly know the laws and regulations on this issue well, so that we could establish a series of safety precautions about our program. After that, we could begin our experiment. So we appeal all the teams that take part in  iGEM to take a focus on bio-s"

N.B: During our minipreps we have always kept solution III on the bench, however Chris seeing this advised us to always keep solution III in the fridge for the best results. As well as this after the addition of solution III the tubes must be shaken well in order for the proteins to precipitate properly. Remember that Phil's protocols may not always be explicit and although care should be taken in following them, there may be important points missed out that can effect results.
The supernatant was taken and Isopropanol added, the solution was spun, ethanol added, aspirated and speed vac'd according to the protocol. The DNA pellet was resuspended in 50ul water, labelled, and frozen in the -20 freezer.
Metal Sensor Team
Introduction
Mathew resuspending the pellet with Resuspension + RNAse Solution
In yesterday's lab session the Metal Sensing team carried out a miniprep of the plasmid pSB1A3, which contained the BioBrick BBa_J33206 (taken from the Parts Registry). This BioBrick contains the arsR binding site as well as the arsR gene - both of which are needed in our system. Once the minipreps were conducted, 10 microlitres of plasmid DNA were taken from three plasmid (pSB1A3) samples (the three samples originating from the three cultures of E.coli containing BBa_J33206 extracted from the plate)and placed into one set of 3 Eppendorf tubes; and then another 10 microlitres were taken from the three samples and put into another set of 3 Eppendorf tubes.
To the first set of 3 Eppendorf tubes, no enzyme was added and to the second tube, a combination of EcoRI and PstI was added. Once the restriction enzyme digests had taken place they were placed in the -20C freezer for use today.
Another thing which was carried out yesterday was preparation of agarose gel; the agarose gel was made up in the usual way, poured in the usual way and when it had set was stored in the fridge (this was done by sprinkling 1 x TAE buffer on the gel surface and then wrapping it in cling film). This gel will be used to analyse the restriction enzyme digests of"

PCR of omega+zif268 with overhangs
We performed a PCR to take out our omega subunit plus zif268. We used the following recipe:

0.75 ul of hindIII (primer)
0.75 ul of wF+plLacO (primer)
1.2 ul template
12.3 ul water
The first steps of the PCR involved heating at 95* (for 5 minutes) and 98* (for 20 seconds). Annealing temperature was 56*. Extension time was 30 seconds.
The product of the PCR should be 709 bps. It includes the omega subunit, zif268, as well as overlap sequences homologous to the selection plasmid.  We ran an e-gel to ensure that our desired product was present:
Gel purification of PCR product
We had to gel purify our PCR product in preparation for isothermal assembly, using our protocol for gel purification .  The result from running the gel can be seen below - we cut out the bands at 709 bp, the expected size of our product.
In the final step of the purification process, we eluted our DNA in buffer EB. We used the nanodrop spectophotometer to determine the concentration of DNA present.

Brasil-USP,2015,Team:Brasil-USP#Notebook#Safety_-_-_TEXT.html," by sok, we have inserted only one hok sequence in this design.
While the cells contain the DNA circuit and are inside the bioreactor, they will produce both the toxin and antitoxin, and will live. If they leave the bioreactor, sok won’t be produced, and the cell will die due to hok presence.
For cells that didn’t inherited the developed DNA circuit: these will contain Hok in their plasma, but not sok - this is due to the difference in their degradation rates; while sok has a half life of 30 seconds, the half life of hok is much higher: of 30 minutes. Therefore, these cells would die, avoiding the decrease in process efficiency. The mok gene helps in the hok translation.
Disposal of Biological Material at the Laboratory
    In order to minimize the release of the developed bacteria to the environment, we were very careful in the disposal of biological material at the laboratory. All liquid cell cultures were autoclaved and, after reaching room temperature, disposed on the sink. Used agar plates were autoclaved inside a bag and disposed on common waste. Pipette tips were incinerated before being disposed. There was also the possibility of using a powder disinfectant called Virkon. Usually, this compound is mixed with the contaminated material for 30 minutes. After that, the materials were discarded on common waste.

Risks to the population
    We are using a strain of E. coli that it's not supposed to survive greatly in the environment. If the kill switch fails, the bacteria will only survive in extreme conditions, which was a low probability to occur. The bacteria used do not offer any harm to humans as stated before. The main molecule produced in this process is the 12-oxo-4,8-dimethyltrideca-4,8-diene-1-al (ODTD).  There are no reports about the threat that this compound offers to the environment and to humans.  Additionally, both of proteins used only degradates the polymer of the rubber, therefore, they don’t offer any harm to humans once we do not have this polymer constituting cell process.
Risks to the environment
    As we use inducible promoters for producing the rubber degrading enzymes, if rhamnose isn’t present on the environment, our genic circuit is off - presenting no threats. Besides E. coli being present in several nature systems, such as water, soil, sand, sediments, and algae, we didn’t find any evidence that free"

Notebook – Results – 1. Construction of BBa_J04450 + constitutive promoter/crr or cyaA
We planned to construct BBa_J04450 as circuit #1 (original circuit) followed downstream by our original circuit #2. Circuit #2 is composed by BBa_J2319 (constitutive promoter) / BBa_B0034 (RBS) / crr (IIA(Glc) or cyaA (Adenylate cyclase) / BBa_B0015 (double terminator).
So the first step was to clone either cyaA or crr from E. coli to Biobrick construct. PCR fragments with correct size were able to be obtained. After direct restriction with EcoRI and SpeI, the fragments were cloned into pSB1C3 backbone.
Next step was to construct, BBa_J2319 (chloramphenicol) / BBa_B0034 (ampicillin) and crr or cyaA (chloramphenicol) / BBa_B0015 (chloramphenicol). For BBa_J2319 / BBa_B0034 construction, prefix insertion was used. Thus ligation product was screened on ampicillin LB agar plate. While for crr or cyaA / BBa_B0015 construction, suffix insertion was used because the large size of crr or cyaA could be isolated by agarose gel excision. After BBa_J2319 / BBa_0034 (ampicillin) and crr or cyaA / BBa_0015 (chloramphen"

Assembly work
As shown in the roadmap of our work, we finished assemblying most of the designed system except the pNOT parts.  We submitted 167 biobricks finally.
Measument work : Most our parts are measured to prove their utility and get useful parameters.
6 constitutive promoter are measured and marked with barcode system.
Hybrid promoter and related tetR,LuxI,LuxR are proved to work well in our models .
Several models were established and fitted our data pretty well.
Density control parts(ccdB related) do not work stably and need further improvements.We tried to add LVA to ccdB to improve its stability ,but it did not work.

DTU-Denmark,2014,Team:DTU-Denmark#Achievements#Modelling_-_-_TEXT.html," concentration of Spinach can be calculated:
Quantification of Spinach Per Cell
The amount of Spinach per cell can be calculated if the cell density is measured:
The CFU count can also be approximated with an OD600 measurement:
The Spinach concentration should be in units molecules per liter. This can be calculated from μM by multiplying by Avogadros Constant and dividing by 106.
Calculating Spinach Production Rate
During balanced growth, or steady state, there is an equilibrium between the production and degradation of Spinach. This means that the steady state concentration of Spinach is given by the relationship.
where β is the production rate of Spinach (molecules per second), μ is the growth rate of the cells (s-1) and αdeg is the in vivo degradation rate of Spinach (s-1).
Thus the Spinach production rate can be calculated by:
By combining the equations derived above, the Spinach RNA production rate β can be calculated from the Spinach concentration and cell density:
β is a measure of the total production rate of Spinach in the cell. If β is divided by the number of Spinach genes i.e. the plasmid copy number, the obtained production rate per gene copy is analogous to the promoter activity.
The degradation rate of Spinach must be measured. This is most easily done by growing a cell culture that expresses Spinach and stopping the transcription and thereby the production of new Spinach RNA by adding rifampicin. The degradation of Spinach can then be monitored by taking a time series of samples and measuring fluorescence on each one (see our protocol (link)).
The above derivations are equally valid for Spinach2 and Spinach2.1 as well as for the modified ligand DFHBI-1T. See our results section (LINK) for how this model was applied to our experimental data.

REC-CHENNAI,2017,Team:REC-CHENNAI#Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html," come to understand that the public is more educated about synthetic biology than we expected.
We gave out survey forms before and after explaining our project, and everything we know about synthetic biology. We also did a comparative study between the two and we believe that we have made a change in the minds of people who doubted the potential of synthetic biology.
A little over 250 participants took up the survey and the results were quite interesting. Here are some highlights
After a brief explanation about synthetic biology and Latarcoli, this was the response to the same question.
The rise was significant and a lot more people were informed about synthetic biology.We shot another question before the interaction.
Well, after our interaction there was a significant decrease in the amount of people who voted ‘no’.
We asked a range of questions concerning Latarcoli and its relevance to the society, of which a few are mentioned below. The results gave us so much more confidence about Latarcoli.
This took us by quite a surprise, since we were not expecting the majority of the respondents to know about antibiotic resistance.
We still feel a little proud to have increased awareness, with this result.
We interacted with the 9.4% respondents who thought it was unsafe and found out that they were predominantly worried about human safety and ethical issues. We addressed this, citing laws and regulations governing GMOs. We also explained to them how Latarcin is safe enough for its application in food.
Through this survey, we think we have achieved at least a little part of our objective of creating awareness about synthetic biology.

Tranformation of protein A
I transformed 100 ul BL21 cells with both 1 and 3 ul of protein A inserted into the peX vector. This transformation is carried out in order to perform an IPTG induction on protein A in BL21 e.coli cells.
The transformation procedure is described in protocols. However, in step 1 I thawed the cells in 15 min instead of 10 min. In step 2 I added 1 ul of DNA sample to 100 ul BL21 cells and 3 ul of DNA sample to an additional 100 ul BL21 cells.
Sequencing of tyrosinase
Since the last sequencing of the two tyrosinase samples did not turn out well, I send two new tyrosinase samples for sequencing. This time I mixed the sample with primers complementary to the bank vector iGEM send the gene in. I therefore mixed with the primer VR. I choose VR instead of VF2 because I wanted the primer to bind closer to the site where I performed a site directed mutagenesis"

It was great to meet the Edinburgh students that we had been in contact with via email and hear their advice on how best to approach the medal requirements. They also informed us of mistakes that they have learned from in the past, such as the importance of accurately labelling DNA submissions for shipment. Each of the three iGEM teams (Edi UG, OG and St Andrews) gave 20 minute presentations on their projects. This included the progress so far in the wet lab and modelling, as well as future aims for the summer and areas still in consideration. Each presentation was followed by about half an hour of questioning from the audience, which helped the teams consider improvements and missing aspects of their current projects. In addition to these presentations, supervisors of each team gave talks on their specialties. For example, there was a large focus on the importance of integrated human practices, and how we could change an aspect of our project in response to meetings with stakeholders. We were also lucky enough to hear Will Wright, an after iGEM ambassador, speak about the giant jamboree, and how this is an exciting opportunity to present our projects and connect with like-minded people. The strong benefits of taking part in the iGEM competition were highlighted and we were encouraged to enjoy the experience.  Overall, we were extremely lucky to be able to reach out to a more experienced team who helped us better understand the requirements of iGEM and to make improvements on our project that we otherwise would not have considered."

Undergraduate Research Student Poster Showcase
Members of the 2016 Macquarie iGEM team had chance to promote their research and the unique opportunity that is iGEM. We presented a preliminary version of our research poster at the undergraduate student poster showcase.
Explaining the concept and scientific principles behind synthetic biology, by no means a simplistic endeavour, to students and academics without a scientific background was an intriguing experience. It also carried a certain level of responsibility – telling the general public about manipulating living things can evoke a very strong response.
It was a great opportunity to put synthetic biology and the amazing possibilities it presents in the spotlight. We were able to promote iGEM as a driver of new ideas and a possibility for the scientists of tomorrow to get a real opportunity to be involved in new, exciting scientific research. We spoke to fellow science undergraduates about the possibility that they themselves could become a part of the Macquarie iGEM team in coming years – and they amazing opportunities that would be on offer if they did.
We were particularly excited to see that, when we drew a large crowd and were busy explaining concepts to some individuals, other individuals who had already spoken to us were explaining to others who came to have a look. It was extremely exciting to see people getting enthusiastic about our project and engaging in current science.
The undergraduate showcase was a fantastic opportunity for Team Macquarie to practice consolidating the diverse elements of the project into a coherent whole. Poster besides, we even got a chance to practice presenting our research, an invaluable experience we hope will come in handy for the International Giant Jamboree.

This week we wanted to complete the assembly of an aTc sensor and to test if lacZ works. Sequence analysis cannot be efficiently performed on I732017 or on A3 because of lacZ coding sequence length (>3 Kb), so we decided to check lacZ integrity assembling a constitutive promoter upstream of A3 and testing the ligation on X-Gal plates.

Results showed that over-expression of enzymes involved in purine biosynthesis did elevate uric acid production compared to E. coliXOR (Figure 13). Interestingly, this time the combination of purM and purD exhibited lowest oxidation activity and we will design more experiments to explore the reason behind. Notably, comparing uric acid produced without extra xanthine by these bacteria with that of E. coliXOR with extra xanthine, bacteria co-transformed with Prs, PurC and PurD, Prs and PurD, PurF and Prs still showed higher oxidation activity (Figure 14). These results confirmed our idea that by over-expressing related enzymes, more purines can be produced for uric acid synthesis. Our future work is to co-express other enzymes and calibrate the ratio of different enzymes to achieve maximum uric acid production.

After sitting overnight
Here is a picture of the chromoproteins we tested yesterday after they have been sitting overnight. They did not regain any of their color because they were denatured at the high temperature.
●
The liquid cultures we grew up overnight from the transformations that had been plate with the DNA 2.0 chromoproteins plus the flag-lumio his-tag did not show any color but when spun down did show cell growth
●
The protein extraction we performed yesterday does not show any of the color that is should. We believe this is because the flag-lumio-his-tag was inserted onto the wrong terminus (C terminus) on the chromoprotein which might be where the chromophore (what gives the chromoprotein color) is attached and so the tag attaches here and doesn't allow the color to show.

Because we believe this tag is interacting with the chromophore on every DNA 2.0 chromoprotein this would be why the cultures we grew up overnight were not showing any color
●
Because we think the tag is on the wrong terminus we are going to use Enterokinase to cleave off the flag-lumio his-tag and see if the color then appears.

Discovered there was a secondary restriction site in our DNA 2.0 chromoproteins that had not shown up on one of our softwares. 2 of the restriction sites are the same so we were cutting out ~50 base pairs of our chromoprotein unintentionally which is why the color was not being seen when we did the Gibson"

""In Uganda, where the banana is a key source of nutrition, there is considerable vitamin A deficiency and also iron deficiency in diets,"" said Professor James Dale of Queensland University in Australia. He wants to develop a banana as “golden “as the rice to combat the results of iron and Vitamin A deficiency like blood disorders or a lower immunity.

Wageningen_UR,2013,Team:Wageningen UR#Masterclass_-_-_TEXT.html," best”, synthetic biology is constructed as more natural, hereby denying that scientists only use more “difficult synthetic things”. In line 4, one of the visitors reacts with laughter.  After the laughter, the iGEM member starts with: “but is just also fun to fiddle around with that”. He constructs the work they do as something that is “fun” and is like “fiddling”. By doing this, he presents the topic iGEM works on as “light and easy” and nice to do in the study of Paulien referred to as “just normal”.
The group working on the text fragments we got.
After one hour of analysing, we had a whole group discussion to discuss our findings and we put up several points on a whiteboard that in our eyes were important for interactions with society. Each team member was then given four arrows to be put at the topic they thought needed some extra attention.
Figuring out which points are most important to us by putting arrows on the white-board.
The most highlighted topics were subsequently discussed and finally we selected five issues we wanted to work on in the next months.   Responsibility: We want to show (non-) scientists that we do not fiddle around and approach research responsibly. Receiver: We want to inform people on a level that is adjusted to their knowledge and interest.  Context: We need to be aware of the difference in context at different occasions; perceptions change according to recent events and are thus related to both the location and time.  Expectations: Find out what the public expects of a presentation and adjust the story we wish to tell accordingly.  Usefulness: We want to show that we add something new to the already existing knowledge and that our work is useful.
What did we learn?
Next to the five points mentioned in the discussion we learned that: 1. Outreach activities are greatly appreciated: not only do iGEM students enjoy these excursions away from the lab, they help you step outside of your (scientific) comfort zone.
2. As an iGEM team, stay in contact with members of the previous years: they are an ENORMOUS source of experience.
3. Even though the scientific projects between teams from the same institution can differ vastly, there is always overlap in the scientific outreach activities (resources): It is better to build on the outreach efforts from previous years then start over yourself again to make improvements possible.
How to improve the conversations of iGEM over the years
When scientific outreach is continued over the years (and therefore over different teams), it can be reflected upon, thus allowing for progression of the"

Validation of the loss of BBa_J72008: all the picked colonies did not grow in Amp (50 ug/ml) media, thus validating that <partinfo>BBa_J72008</partinfo> Amp-resistant helper had been actually cured from the cells. However, one of these 12 clones (MG-GFP-A) also failed to grow in Cm (12.5 ug/ml) liquid media, probably because of a mistake in its inoculation. We decided not to consider this clone and to continue with 11 clones.
Validation of the actual integration site: colony PCR was performed for all the 11 clones, using MC1061 and MG1655 without integrants as negative controls. Primer pairs P1/P2 and P3/P4 were used to validate the presence of the integrative vector in the Phi80 genomic locus, while the primer pair P2/P3 was used to validate the presence of multiple tandem integrants (see Fig.1 in Materials and Methods).

This collaboration with our ""brother"" team on the main campus consists of Modelling aiding, we started the collaboration at the ends of August. We had some meetings to discuss about our projects  dealing with the experimental and theoretical aspects of each project in order to establish how we were going to help us.
The guys from UNAM-Cinvestav team have a good background in the usage of mathematical tools applied to analyze biological systems, so that they made a model to describe the evolution of the communication process between the three bacterial chassis that we designed. The idea was to look for the parameters that could allow an oscillatory behavior in the light based communication process, analyzing the dynamics of  the feed-back activation loop designed as the circuit of communication.  The idea and model is hosted here There is also some information for the individual model link Merging our model results with those obtained by them we could analyse the following:
The possibility to engineer coordinated cellular behavior in cell populations: Synchronizing oscillations.
The system response to a predefined range of signal stimuli.
Investigate spatiotemporal patterning of gene expression.
Our team was working with the experimental procedures to characterise the promoter activities in terms of RPUs (relative promoter units) as well with the PoPS protocol.

Bio-safety
Questionnaire about laws on transgene and bio-safety
In order to know more about the opinions on transgene laws from iGEMers and students majoring in synthetic biology, we designed questionnaires and finished the survey. 177 students finished our questionnaire, most of whom were iGEMers or undergraduates and graduates majoring in biology. We found out that laws on bio-safety problems still need to be advertised, since a number of students were not familiar with them and thought it would be helpful to know more. Also, we provided some of the details in the laws, and majority students replied that they were useful to their study and research work.
Video about bio-safety in laborites
This year, UCAS iGEM team collaborated with other nine Chinese iGEM team, making a series of videos which focused on bio-safety to help Chinese students learn more about bio-safety.

Heidelberg,2017,Team:Heidelberg#Pace_-_-_TEXT.html," showing the second part of the construction of our PACE device. The syringe pumps (green) as well as the valve control and the oxygen supply are shown. All necessary tubings and cables are inserted in the heating cabinet.
Our PACE protocol
Before starting a PACE run, several prerequisites have to be fulfilled. Most of the preparations for the different PACE runs are the same in terms of tests for MP activity, F-Pilus plasmids and contamination. Additionally, several pre-tests are recommended to test the APs activity and the general functionality of the implemented genetic circuit.
Every part of the PACE device including all tubings and connectors have to be autoclaved. All open ends should be wrapped in aluminium foil. It is important to check all ends and tubings to be closed before start the dry autoclavation (Be aware of autoclaving only autoclavable parts of the PACE device).
After autoclavation, the PACE device should be treated with highest carefulness to prevent phage contamination in the turbidostat. To make this possible, the use of 10% H2O2 or incidin as well as the usage of gloves is advised.
Rebuild the PACE apparatus carefully using incidin to desinfect all for the autoclavation wrapped and thereby closed ends. Connect all necessary parts of the tubings.
The medium should be prepared slightly different to the medium used in literature [Esvelt et al., 2011] by mixing 140g dikaliumhydrogenphosphate with 40g kaliumdihydrogenphosphate, 20g ammoniumsulfate and 20 ml tween-80 in 20l dH20. The medium should be autoclaved as well before using it.
the autoclaved medium should be mixed with medium supplements, which should be prepared during autoclavation. 20g glucose, as well as 10g sodium citrate, 0.5g L-leucin, 0.5g and 100g casamino acids or trypton from casein have to be solved in at last 500 ml dH20. If the chemicals cannot be dissolved in this volume, water can be added until it can be solved. The resulting solution have to be sterile filtrated.
the appropiate volume of the prepared supplements can now be added to the autoclaved medium. This should be implemented in as steril conditions as possible, using incidin to sterilize the used pipette. In addition to the supplements, the appropiate antibiotics have to be added into the"

Pneumosensor Future Work
Lysis Module
Our team designed but was unable to test this module due to the limitation of not being able to work directly with Streptococcus       Pneumoniae (Biosafety level 2) in our lab. This module proposes to kill Streptococcus Pneumoniae upon detection when coupled       with the detection and  modules by releasing specific bacteriophage lytic enzymes, Cpl-1 and Pal.
Amidase (PAL)- cleaves the peptidoglycan between N-acetylmuramic acid and L-alanine
Lysozyme (CPl-1)- cleaves the glycosidic bond between N-acetylmuramic acid and N-acetylglucosamine
The enzymes are tagged with osmY ( BBa_K892008 , Washington 2012) via a linker to be exported out of Escherichia coli. Both enzymes have       very different N-terminal catalytic sites and share a similar C-terminal cell wall attachment site, which binds to choline in both cases.       Cleavage with either of these enzymes results in a weakening in the cell wall, which leads to the externalization of the cytoplasmic       membrane and ultimate lysis of S. pneumoniae.
PcomCDE
PcomCDE is a promoter induced by phosphorylated ComE, which can be replaced by a phosphorylmimetic mutant (ComED58E) in experiment. We could not    manage to verify the sequence of our ligated product, PcomCDE- BBa_E0240. Therefore, in the future, we hope to continue the verification process, and complete our    construct.
σx, PcelA, PcomFA
PcelA and PcomFA promoters are promoter that is regulated by σx. We have proven that"
SZU-China,2018,Team:SZU-China#Demonstrate_-_-_TEXT.html," And in group infected by modified transformant, we used the same among of powder to infect 10 cockroaches individually.
The results showed that wild-type M.anisopliae toke effect after two days, while transformant took effects less than one day. For mortality each day, transformant showed above two times significantly higher (P <0.05) mortality than wild-type. Two groups reached stationary state after four days, above 20% mortality in wild-type, while 50% in transformant.

Necessity of using GreenGround
We found some problems that the non-woven fabric is so light that it maybe fly away, and the emulsifiable powder exposure to light may die easier.
To solve this problem, we designed the GreenGround series, which has 3 generations of products (please click on Applied Design for details). We finally chose the third generation and patented it. In order to test the effect of the box on the killing effect, we did a comparative experiment and the results are as follows.

This shows that our GreenGround can maintain the lethal effect of Metarhizium anisopliae, so it’s necessary to use.
Fig 5：The third generation of GreenGround
Because of the Do Not Release Policy, we couldn’t test our transformant in our GreenGround. But from the evidence above we can see that, it has the ability of producing a great amount of spores, high mortality, and necessity of using GreenGround. We believe that if we combine our spores and GreenGround together, the product would work well.

Summer Science Party
When we started our public engagement, we asked what would be the most challenging thing when we need to talk about synthetic biology to the public? Further idea that branches out is that how can we introduce synthetic biology to small kids? Indeed, in as more as we are absolved into scientific studies, we found ourselves hard to express something difficult like scientific terms to people who has very little background about biology. But nothing is impossible!
We had a blast in workshops introducing DNA models and DNA extraction which is arranged during the ""Summer Science Party 2017"" and organized by the Hong Kong Science Park. This activity aims to educate children about biology while acting as a platform to converse with parents regarding to their opinions towards synthetic biology.
With our target audience being children from the age of 4 to 12, we hold the believe that we can ignite the interest for biology to children at an early age through fun games. We therefore uses candies as a material to make into 3D DNA model which they can bring it back home afterwards. Unlike the minipreps that we do in our lab, the DNA extraction workshop also involves easy and accessible household objects such as meat tenderizer and ethanol so children can try out the same experiment with different fruits to compare their DNA amount, imprinting them with first impression and a growing interest for biology at the developmental age.
Throughout the workshops, we were able to receive instant feedbacks from parents regarding to their understanding of synthetic biology and genetically modified organisms. With more than 75 participants in the survey, 58% claimed to have knowledge about GMOs.  Within this group of participants, 63% knows that genes inside the organism is changed, while an equal percent of participants also think that GMOs greatly affects the ecosystem. 54% of the people voiced GMO will negatively affect human health.
However, these responses contradicts to our research findings prior to the events. There is no valid proof that GM food is harmful to human health. Our team realized"

Sydney_Australia,2016,Team:Sydney Australia#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," a substance that is permitted for use as a food additive by Standard 1.3.1 or as a processing aid by Standard 1.3.3.
Schedule 26 lists various permitted GMOS, including may herbicide-tolerant and insect-protected plant lines. GMOs are also permitted for use as food additives and, importantly, processing aids. Food additives perform some technological purpose in the final product, such as acting as a colouring or preservative. Processing aids perform a technological purpose at some point during the production process, but do not end up in the final product.
Certain enzymes of animal, plant and microbiological origin are permitted as processing aids, as listed in Schedule 18. Enzymes of microbiological origin that are permitted must be obtained from the specific organism listed. However, interestingly, ‘the sources listed in relation to enzymes of microbial origin may contain additional copies of genes from the same organism.’ With relevance to our project, our biosensor is clearly not listed as a permitted food additive or processing aid. However, perhaps it is neither. If it can be used as a device in the ripening facilities or shipping containers that never comes into contact with the fruit, then it would be neither food additive nor processing aid. In this context, it is necessary also to consider the potential for contamination, as there may be accidental contact between the biosensor and the fruit. Standard 1.6.1 details the regulations concerning microbiological limits in food, but this is mostly relevant for meats and dairy products which could be spoiled if the microbiological presence is too high. In any case, the design of our final product would need to reflect these concerns to either control for potential contamination or, ideally, remove the risk through a cell-free system.
Microbe Card Game Project
One of our team members set out to design a card game that stylised various bacteria as little monsters. The card game was intended to be both educational and fun, introducing some of the more common bacteria that are involved in food and health to the wider community. To keep things simple, the game was going to have standard “top trumps” style rules, with categories like “pathogenicity” and “antibiotic resistance.” More complicated words would be bolded, with a reference list explaining these words in an educational way. Although the project was not completed, it remains an idea that will be pursued in the future. You can see some of the designs below.
We also created our own series of hand-sewn versions of our microbes! Doing so allowed us to engage with a younger audience in a way that was more specific"
UC_Chile,2012,Team:UC Chile#Cyanolux#Project short_-_-_TEXT.html," therefore, to control light emission over time we decided to control it´s abundance in the cells, which in our model is a function of the substrates generation (by Lux C, D, E and G enzymes) and consumption (by the LuxAB luciferase).
In turn, the production of these enzymes can be specifically set to any desired  time of the day by fusing their CDSs to promoters controlled by the circadian rhythm.
Mathematical Modelling
Our model works as a “black box” in which the input takes the form of a specific hour of the day (i.e the hour on which you want your metabolite to reach maximal concentration) and the output is a couple of promoters from Synechocystis genome.  It assumes that the metabolite's production is controlled by enzymes under the control of promoter 1 and it´s degradation by enzymes under promoter 2. For more details please check here
Wetlab strategy
Having chosen the right promoters we set out to built our constructs to transform Synechocystis. As there weren´t straighforward tools to start working with in the registry (i.e characterized plasmids backbones, protocols, etc) we started from scratch.
We designed two recombination plasmids backbones.  One targets a gene essential for our chassis survival in the environment (see biosafety) and the other one a neutral site.
Our strategy was to insert the LuxAB genes (luciferase) under a circadian promoter with an expression peak right after dusk, in the neutral recombination plasmid; and the LuxCDEG genes (substrate production) with the appropriate promoter in the biosafety plasmid.
See plasmids in results section
Implementation
Synthetic biology inspires in nature making abstractions of its principles and mechanisms. We thought this moto could be applied beyond mollecular genetics...
With the relevance of context in mind, a biomimetic biolamp structure was designed that resembles the organ in which Vibrio fischeri -the bacteria from which the lux genes were biobricked- lives.

Existing Methods Used for Detection
CDC’s efforts at outsmarting the antibiotic resistance focuses on 4 core actions: detect, respond, prevent and discover.  The project is called AR Initiative (Detect and Protect Against Antibiotic  Resistance Initiative), which is an integral part of the CDC strategy to target investment aimed at AR.  Among the AR initiative, detection is the first step that impacts the whole controlling process. Detecting antibiotic resistance quickly and effectively is crucial for determination of the treatment methods  for different patients as well as for quarantines to prevent it from becoming epidemic.  Currently, several methods are used for the detection of the antibiotic resistance.  Most common and traditional method is using growth inhibition assays performed in broth or by agar disc diffusion.   For clinically critical bacteria, diagnostic laboratories perform phenotypic-based analyses using standardized susceptibility testing methods, usually in accordance with the guidelines published by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute.
Using the culture-based approach, it can take 1—2 days to produce results for fast-growing bacteria such as Escherichia coli orSalmonella, but several weeks for slow-growing bacteria such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Moreover, culturing only works for a small fraction of microbes; although most pathogens can be cultured relatively easily thanks to years of accumulated experimental experiences, the vast majority of microbes cannot grow outside their host environment, including pathogens such as Chlamydia orTrypanosomes.
Using newer molecular detection techniques for antibiotic resistance such as quantitative PCR (qPCR) or microarrays, we can determine the presence of specific resistance genes within hours, and we obtain improved diagnosis results. However, these culture-independent approaches target well-known and well-studied pathogens or resistance-causing genes only, and cannot be easily used for broader spectrum screening.
CDC dramatically innovated the detection process by adopting the Advanced Molecular Detection (AMD), which combines the latest pathogen identification technologies with bioinformatics and advanced epidemiology to more effectively understand, prevent and control infectious diseases. Using those technologies, it is possible to rapidly look for a microbe's match among thousands of reference samples in the microbe library.  If no match is found, the whole genomic sequence of the microbe's DNA code can be taken, then quickly analyzed using disease detective works and bioinformatica to answer critical disease-response questions. However, this new method, while it sounds very interesting, is not to be completed until 2020, and still requires incubation, as well as being expensive.

Autofocus
The Problem
Since the start of the OpenScope project, the objective has been to turn our microscope into a fully automated and autonomously operable system. As such, an autofocus feature was essential. Autofocus is especially useful in certain experimental setups including:
Time lapse imaging - to account for stage drift/settling with time
Monitoring of motile samples
Focus stacking - for imaging 3-dimensional objects
Last, but not least, autofocus simply facilitates the work of the person operating OpenScope. Manual focusing, although not very challenging, might still be fiddly, particularly to inexperienced users. This is where the autofocus algorithm comes in. Various methods for performing this task were tried, and the best methods were used in the final version (although the rest of the code is present in our source code).
The Solution
The strategy of the autofocus algorithm is to calculate the focus score for each frame imaged while gradually changing the sample-objective distance. The most sharply focused image corresponds to the maximised focus score. The physics behind the process is very simple: the image of an object, viewed through a lens, is produced at a particular distance from the lens. At any shorter/longer distance from the lens, the light rays from a single point on the object do not converge into a point, causing the image to be blurred. The focus score can be simply regarded as a mathematical function with a single maximum.
Fig, 1: The plot shows the focus score of an image as a function of the distance between the objective and the sample: it is clear that the function has a single maximum. The corresponding images recorded at these distances are also shown. Note that most of the time during the search, the sample remains significantly out-of-focus.
There are, however, several issues to consider and multiple methods exist for calculating the focus score. In addition, there are many ways to scan around for the best focus score. The challenge was to"

6/26/2015: Day 20
Today was another day of brainstorming. Mike Horn came to the lab, and we discussed museum exhibits and children’s interaction. We also looked at some of the project that he has been working on, in order to discuss more design ideas and get inspiration. In the afternoon, we “tested’ the prototype of a game he is working on, which was a lot of fun (we did get quite competitive). We spent more time finalizing layouts and talking about possible designs. It all seems kind of uncertain right now, but I’m sure we’ll be able to come up with a solid new design in no time--we just have to narrow our ideas a bit further.
6/29/2015: Day 21
We spent time talking about the ideas we’d developed last week and discussing how each one promotes collaboration and learning. We have a pretty solid agreement on the general layout of the screen, but we are still undecided on how to incorporate the Environment or Collaboration areas. We have discussed the values of having each space on the screen, and the likelihood that users will use it. We started on a simple paper prototype, which helped narrow down our ideas a bit.
6/30/2015: Day 22
We finished the paper prototype and then Stephanie Houde came to the lab to talk to us about our design. She is an interaction designer and a Wellesley alumna, so it was very nice talking to her. She gave us some very useful and concrete feedback on our prototype, so we are narrowing down our ideas even further. By the end of the day, we actually had a very solid and finalized version of it.
7/1/2015: Day 23
Today was another busy day. Natalie came to give us feedback on our latest iteration. We also had a conversation about aspects of the scientific process that we would like to include in the digital component without making the interaction too overwhelming, and how the wet lab component can complement that experience. We also met with Casey to talk about potential art and design for BacPack, including backgrounds, overall theme, and color choices. At the end of the day, we had a redesigned version of our paper prototype.

We did some more work with the paper prototype today. We tested it with several users from the research program who had never seen it before, and incorporated their feedback into the design. We also went through a set of design cards with"

Mingxian HUANG
Editor of the official account of China Aquaculture Website:
We interviewed Mingxiang Huang, the editor of the official account of China Aquaculture Website, the largest online aquatic products market and the communication platform of fish raisers.
Key point
The water pollution is severe in China, and aquaculture waste water contributes a lot to the ammonia-nitrogen pollution.
The current methods of ammonia-nitrogen degradation are circulating stagnant water and using activated sludge.
Administration and proper guidance is needed for fish raisers in the rural area.
It is important to concern about bio-safety when applying engineered bacteria to ponds.
The information and suggestion we obtained from this interview inspired us to go to synthetic biology for help. We expect to use genetically engineered bacterium to solve this problem. Let’s find a solution to detect and degrade ammonia-nitrogen pollution in a cheap and easy way!

Thereby making a plant directly produce n-butanol, an industrially relevant compound that can serve as a more efficient biofuel than ethanol. The project took on another goal when it was realized that an intermediary compound in the pathway could be used to produce (R)-Polyhydroxybutyrate, a biodegradable plastic.
Vanillin Project
Vanillin is one of the major compounds in the vanilla flavor. A phenolic aldehyde, vanillin is also used in the pharmaceutical industry, beverages, as well as a fragrant compound in different products. The demand of Vanillin exceeded the natural production, so annually most vanillin is produced via chemical synthesis.  We intend to produce vanillin in different plants as a natural alternative for vanillin production.

Advised by Wieden as well as U of L undergraduate and graduate students, the high school team – consisting of 22 students from Lethbridge-area high schools, including Keiran McCormack, Chris Isaac, Elaine Bird, Fiona Spitzig, Yoyo Yao, Patrick O'Donnell and Katie Thomas, who represented the team at the jamboree – successfully created a longer lasting form of Oxytocin. A hormone that’s most-commonly used to aid childbirth, Oxytocin degrades quickly and soon becomes unstable, making it expensive and difficult to store.
While such complex projects can be challenging for high school students, the research experience is invaluable, says former iGEM high school team member Erin Kelly.
“Being on the high school team was a steep learning curve, but I learned research methods through hands-on experience and that definitely made the transition to university easier,” says Kelly. Now a second-year biochemistry student at the U of L, she serves as an advisor to the current iGEM high school team along with fourth-year neuroscience student Isaac Ward and master of biochemistry student Mackenzie Coatham (BSc ’12).
The trio, all former members of the undergraduate iGEM team, have used their resulting research and entrepreneurial skills to launch the spinoff company Synbiologica Ltd. Along with Brandon (now a U of L master’s student in biochemistry), and U of L neuroscience professor Dr. Gerlinde Metz and Wieden as advisors, the group is in the process of patenting their big idea – a biomedical technology that provides rapid hormone-detection results. Their idea is expected to be 93 per cent more cost-effective than traditional antibody technology, bringing the next generation of hormone detection to the research, agriculture and medical markets.
In recognition of its scientific innovation, the Synbiologica team has earned numerous accolades. They include winning $10,000 in the South Venture Business Plan Competition and taking first place in the Tech Stream side of the Chinook Entrepreneurial Challenge, an annual business-planning competition hosted by Community Futures Lethbridge Region. The group received an additional $10,000 in cash, a one-year lease on space in the tecconnect: An Alberta centre for new commerce – a high-tech business incubator operated by Economic Development Lethbridge – plus a range of other in-kind prizes, including business consulting from MNP and ActionCOACH, and several thousand dollars worth of media services.
