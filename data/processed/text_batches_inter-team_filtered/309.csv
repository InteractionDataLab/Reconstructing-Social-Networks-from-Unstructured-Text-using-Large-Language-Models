Favorite Part
The favorite part of pur team is BBa_K2684006 . We improved it from previous part BBa_K1583000 . CsaA is the main component to form biofilm, and by adding SpyTag which was fused onto the csgA sequence, we could fix the CotA laccase with SpyCatcher. Covalent bond would be formed between SpyTag and SpyCatcher.

Conclusion
To conclude, in part 1 we successfully model the bacteria growth in our project. We use Baranyi & Roberts model and we apply Runge-Kutta method and PSO algorithm to get the parameters using the experimental data. This gives a rough prediction for the delay time signal.
In part 2, we simplify the gene circuits as a TCS and furtherly construct a differential equation describing the evolving law of this system. To solve this equation, we apply methods from studies of dynamic system. From detailed analysis, we prove that the delay time is a principally reasonable characteristic signal for this reaction.
With all these analysis and experimental data supported, the final conclusion of the modelling is that the delay time could be used as a special mark for both the promoter and the environmental ammonium concentration.

The Theory
The protein Pirin has in Serratia marcescens been shown to regulate the pyruvate levels by means of inhibition of the PDC [1] . While the Pirin superfamily is diverse and has different functions across different organisms it has been linked to growth inhibition in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 [2] . One could assume that this is done in the same way as in S. marcescens, by inhibiting the PDC and thus choking the Krebs cycle. In S. marcescens this leads to induction of fermentation pathways.
As a side effect we have found data on the ethanol resilience of Synechocysti, obtained through a test of induction of Pirin by ethanol stress [2] , it is here shown that ethanol up to 5% in the growth media has a positive growth effect while it is detrimental to growth at 7.5%. Inhibited growth may be acceptable to us as we would typically be at optimum population density during ethanol production in either case. This proposes that Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 could potentially tolerate concentrations higher than 7.5%.
The Constructs
and  : The desired Construct for Testing Purposes
Status
as of 2009-10-21
The pirAB construct is not yet completed due to some cloning misfortunes with the pirA part. Being short on time and manpower we decided to focus on other parts of the project. Primarily the anti sense RNA:s that are being developed for the same purpose as the pirAB construct, namely shutting down the PDC.

This product aims to replace the common treatments that are used to quell the damage caused by this disease: antibiotics and chemicals. Also, it will reduce costs on losses and operation for treated and infected trees. The economic sector of fruit growing, and more specifically of apple production, is of interest in Mexico and internationally; in 2011 Mexico broke its previous record of 630,500 metric tons, a level that represents a growth of 4% concerning the previous year . Our market research shows us the following key points:
The use of chemicals and antibiotics in the treatment of fire blight is somewhat effective, but it decreases with continuous use which itself makes it more expensive. Big producers, such as “La Norteñita,” are looking for an innovative and effective solution for this disease(Labs, S., 2017).
Due to the excessive use of antibiotics, bacteria are becoming rapidly resistant to them.
A significant profit, represented in great savings and greater yield can be generated through the use of biocontrol; leaving on the side the bioaccumulation in the crops caused by the excessive use of chemical elements and antibiotics.
Therefore, Erwinions was created with the following goals:
Reduce the ecological footprint left by chemicals and antibiotics, as well as combating bacteria without affecting the native microbiota.
Stop the spread of antibiotic resistance in bacteria.Cut down on costs of long-term.
Put forth the knowledge of biocontrols as an eco-friendly solution, for bacterial disease.
Erwinions is the only company that aims to use genetically modified E. amylovora to be used as a biological control against the fire blight disease in Rosaceae crops. This product will be patented, and we will continue enhancing our product through feedback, according to the farmer thus; giving personalized attention which is a mark of difference from our brand. This report will show the outline of our Business Plan, and how we plan to develop our product as well as how to incorporate it into the market.
Costing
In order to evaluate the viability of our proposal, it was necessary to carry out a detailed analysis of the costs of production and the investment required to successfully develop our project. This analysis was projected for a three years lifespan due to the credit concession and investment. That’s why we are simulating a 3 years projection, with an aim of demonstrating uniformity and a favorable picture for our future company.

CAT-Seq Esterase homology model
In-silico description of CAT-Seq Esterase
First, we wanted to determine the type of Esterase enzyme we have. For that reason, we have performed an initial sequence and literature analysis. We have recognized that our enzyme contains a 29-amino acid tannase “signature” sequence starting with “GCSTGGR”, which was described by Banerjee et al:
Figure 1. Sequence alignment to tannase family HMM consensus (PFAM: PF07519)
Accordingly, the CAT-Seq Esterase is most similar to the currently known Tannases and Feruloyl Esterases.

Identifying the Active Site
The template search for the homology model using HHpred revealed two potential hits - two feruloyl esterases (PDB ID: 6G21 and 3WMT ) which had 43% and 40% sequence similarity to our Esterase. Yet, only one of the templates contained a corresponding article released by the time of our homology model generation, however as the templates are homologous, a more similar template, 6G21, was selected.
After choosing the template, initial sequence alignments were constructed using MODELLER. As the quality of homology models highly depend on the quality of their respective template-target alignments, we have performed minor adjustments to the template sequence by correcting the accidental gaps in secondary structures in order to ensure proper mapping of the target sequence to the template. Additionally, the calcium-coordinating motif cysteines C263-C280 and N-terminal C512-C534 were manually aligned to the template to ensure the disulfide bridge formation in the initial CAT-Seq Esterase homology model.
As described in literature, 3WMT template is a serine hydrolase with an Active Site catalytic triad consisting of Serine, Aspartate and Histidine. Since all three sequences align well, we could also identify the catalytic triads for the template 6G21 and our CAT-Seq Esterase, consisting of Ser195, Asp429, His467. The sequence similarities and the positions Catalytic Triad amino acids are highlighted in the illustration below (Fig. 2).

Drug resistance
Drug resistance to antimalarial drugs has occurred in three of the five malaria species known to affect humans until today: P. falciparum, P. vivax and P. malariae.
P. falciparum has developed resistance to nearly every kind of antimalarial drugs currently available, such as chloroquine, sulfadoxine/ pyrimethamine, mefloquine, halofantrine, and quinine. Artemisinin-based drugs are the exception here. Although, recently a low-grade resistance to artemisinin-based drugs has emerged in parts of Southeast Asia.
P. vivax is chloroquine resistant. 3
It has been observed that patients with sickle cell anaemia and other globin abnormalities have a hereditary partial resistance against Malaria infections. It is still unknown how exactly this preexisting conditions affect Malaria infections, but it has been resolved that they interfere in the development cycle of Plasmodia. 4
Drug resistance tests
In response to the development of drug resistances in Plasmodium, an in vitro micro-test for the assessment of the response of Plasmodium falciparum to chloroquine, mefloquine, quinine, sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine, and amodiaquine as well as an in vitro assessment of antimalarial drugs against P. vivax has been established. 6
Life Cycle
The life cycle of Plasmodium spp. is quite complex. While asexual reproduction occurs in vertebrates, sexual reproduction occurs in female Anopheles mosquitos. In the following, the development in humans will be the main theme: When the female mosquito takes its blood meal, it injects the sporozoites into the dermis (A, B in figure 1). They then attain the vascular system and thus the liver, where they leave the sinusoids behind and enter the hepatocytes (B). At this point they start schizogony, a form of asexual reproduction, forming tens of thousands of merozoites in merosomes. In this form, they leave the hepatocytes and return to the bloodstream (B). With the infection of erythrocytes by merozoites, the asexual reproductive cycle begins: They enter an erythrocyte, form"

Rational design of biobrick parts and protocols is an iGEM tenet that Team Edinburgh UG have embraced this year through mathematical modelling. The mechanistic modelling of our DNA degrading killswitch was used to check for viability and to decide which promoters and ribosome binding sites to use in the final parts. Modelling the probability of failure of our Semantic Containment system to prevent horizontal gene transfer allowed us to calculate the failure rate of our parts combining engineering safety techniques with Synthetic Biology. Using ordinal logistic regression we were able to use growth curve data to identify which of our Semantic Containment parts was present within an organism providing a quick way to diagnose instances of Semantic Containment failure. In our collaboration with Team Vilnius-Lithuania we produced a mechanistic model of protein synthesis within the PURE cell free system to assess how addition of mRNA would effect protein expression.

Background
Normally, bacteria cannot survive in extremely acid and alkali. So before producing acid or alkali, the bacteria should be able to tolerate acidic or alkaline environment. Two devices are applied to achieve it.
The first is alkali-resistance device, consisting of Nha protein family.
Nha is a family containing a number of bacterial sodium-proton anti-porters. These are integral membrane proteins that catalyze the exchange of proton for sodium in a manner highly dependent on the pH. To resist different pH, we select two genes, NhaA and Nha, from this family.
NhaA is the archetypal Na+/H+ antiporter and the only member of the family that is required by E.coli for survival under alkaline stress[1,2]. It is a membrane protein consisting of 388 residues[3]. NhaA excretes Na+ from the cytoplasm using the energy from the cotransport of protons down their electrochemical gradient into the cell, with a characteristic electrogenic stoichiometry of two protons to one Na+[4,5](Fig.1). Like many other Na+/H+ antiporters, NhaA is regulated by pH. It is essentially inactive below pH 7, and the Na+ efflux rate increases by three orders of magnitude between pH 6.5 and 8.5[6].
Fig.1
Fig.2
The NhaB gene encodes Na+/H+ antiporter catalyzing the exchange of 3 H+ per 2 Na+(Fig.2). [7]NhaB has a high affinity for sodium. In the absence of NhaA, NhaB confers a certain tolerance to Na+ which decreases with increasing pH. Essential for regulation of intracellular pH under alkaline conditions, NhaB is crucial when the level of NhaA activity is limiting, when NhaA is not sufficiently induced, and/or when NhaA is not activated[8]. Unlike NhaA, the activity of N"
CLSB-UK,2017,Team:CLSB-UK#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html," measurement techniques that make these methods unsuitable for mass screening. The quantity and quality of miRNAs isolated from a biological sample is also variable and miRNA levels differ in serum and plasma (and may be affected by anticoagulants). Implementing a standard process for sample preparation is key to solving these problems as well as creating better reagent sets and investigating the differences in miRNA levels from different sources.

Safety
We also considered the safety of all the different parts of our project. As a high school in the UK, making sure all aspects of our work were completely safe was central to our project. See our safety page for details.

Newsletter
Introduction
Inter-team communication is beneficial for each participant to catch up with valuable information and further improve the iGEM project according to advice from other teams. It is popular to use social websites or forums as a platform of inter-team communication. This year, XMU-China team (From Xiamen University) started a project named Newsletter, which aims to provide a series of online pamphlets that is regularly updated with communication letters from teams around the world. SYSU-China also participates in the Newsletter (see Fig-1).

The Newsletter mainly contains two sections: an introduction to the team’s current project and new things of fun about the team. Thus, all teams have a chance to get close to one another, and then create more opportunity for iGEM work. As participants of Newsletter, we introduced our team and project, shared our fun in daily life, and keep refreshing experiment progress.
SYSU-China in Newsletter – Special contribution
We are lucky and glad to have a chance to provide further help for XMU-China, which includes: iGEM judging form assistance and the interview for special issue, as one of the most active teams participating in Newsletter.
1. iGEM judging form assistance
We are glad to assist XMU-China team in releasing the survey questionnaire about individual evaluation on official iGEM judging questions. After we received their request for official judging form information, we shared with them our previous feedback form which includes the questions they need, and we sincerely hope that our material can help them conduct the survey among all teams.
As the result shown in their special issue-1, the survey was successfully conducted and reliable data was obtained. It seems that the question list did help them in better understanding the current official judging form, and we believe this work is useful to improve the scoring system of iGEM competition.
2. The interview with the glorious team: SYSU-China in 2013

Another set of transfections took place simultaneously with the same materials minus the gRNA expression vector as a negative control. The fold increase between the basal level of expression from the control and the activated level of expression was then recorded. The results can be found below.
Phase 2 Results
With our parts of our project well characterized, we began experimenting with achieving a variety of consistent expression levels with our dCAS9-VPR activator. Our first strategy was to attempt multimerizing the target operators, placing two and then three operators up stream of the gene of interest using two of our operators. During this experiment, we also tested the effect of spacing the target operators with a different number of intervening base pairs. We tested with 0, 3, 6, 12, and 24 intervening base pairs. The results of these experiments yielded a predictable, linear correlation between the number of operators and the expression level and the number of base pairs in the intervening sequences. The results can be found below:
There were some anomalies within this data set. The target operators with 0 and 12 base pair spacing had lower expression than expected. One explanation is that when the operators are at 0 and 12 base pairs apart, they are on the same side of the DNA helix and crowd each other out. Once we eliminated these results, were able to create a smooth progression in expression level across several levels of expression, as seen below.
Finally, we realized that while we could achieve a wide range of high expression levels, it is sometimes favorable to lower expression levels below the standard single operator expression level. In order to accomplish this, we mutated our operators, replacing a base pair at a time. We tested 20 versions of 2 of our operator plasmids. Each version had one of the twenty base pairs in the twenty base pair operator mutated, so that there was a single mismatch between the operator and the guide RNA attached to the dCAS9-VPR system. By changing the location of the single mismatch, we were able to create another smooth curve of changing expression levels, this time lowering expression levels. The expression levels can be found in the graph below.
Phase 3 Results
Now that we could achieve a variety of expression levels, we began integrating our system into recombination based circuitry. The circuit we used could release a different gRNA for every combination of drugs introduced. Before integrating our multimerized plasmids, we first tested the circuit by making each gRNA correspond to a different fluorescent reporter"

ETH_Zurich,2014,Team:ETH Zurich#modeling#whole_-_-_TEXT.html," input concentration of either AHLs is greater than 100 nM due to the effect of cross-talk.
Alternate Design
We collaborated with the Edinburgh iGEM team 2014 . Their project is focused on communication between bacteria using metabolites as communicating molecules. Combining one metabolite molecule with another quorum sensing molecule could be a solution to avoid cross-talk. We derived a model on the molecular level of their problem (see the Alternate Design section on the quorum sensing module page ). We inserted the equations in our system, putting B (metabolite) instead of LasAHL as communicating molecule.
Here, we present the simulation results. The four possibilities of the XOR gate are presented in the following figure. The system was the one with a feedback corresponding to the metabolite pathway. Thus, when the only input is Lux-AHL, the cell will produce the metabolite B and create a feedback loop, which will switch off the gate. This behvior can indeed be observed on the following figure.
Figure 9 Dynamic simulations of the deterministic single-cell model. One input is a metabolite concentration. Cross-talk is then supposed to be assumed.
It exhibits an XOR behavior. It could be possible to combine quorum sensing and metabolite wiring to make the pattern appear.

Light&Logic Gate Model
Overview
    As our design presents, our simple cipher machine includes a light-input and light-output system. According to the reference, we have found that the intensity of GFP/RFP fluorescence is related to the intensity of the input red/green light(Ig,Ir ) the concentration of the induce substance, which is directly related to the GFP output fluorescence.     Therefore, we attempt to explore the quantitative relationship between them.     According to our design, we have combined our light-input system CcaS/R and logic AND gate system, one of whose input is a type of induces substance while the other one is controlled by light. With the change of our code book, different input substances and output substances are applied. Thus, to simplify the problem, we divide the whole model into to correlated parts, light-input and AND logic gate and build the model for only one condition, which is shown as following.
Pic 1  The Modeling system
Light-Controlled Model
    In our light-input part, we tried to find the relationship between the previous light intensity and the output of the Ccas/R system.  According to the reference,  we’ve got the following equations:
    The two dynamic variables in this model are the production rate of sfGFP, p(t),and the sfGFP abundance, g(t). And c0 represents the original fluorescence of sfGFP. According to our reference, the function of c(t) and kp(c) can be defined as:
    Therefore, to simplify the problem, we choose to simulate the steady-state, where Ig<I0 = 0.169W/(m^2). According to our reference, if Ig>I0, the"

Their team members will design synthetic biology                         science brochures and we would made into a poster. The poster will be displayed together with                         the posters of DLUT_CHINA_B in several primary and secondary schools in Dalian as well as the                         libraries of Dalian University of Technology. We hope that more primary and middle school                         students will grow a great interest in synthetic biology through the activities.
Our team came to the High School affiliated to Dalian University of Technology. After the team                         members explained the principle of synthetic biology, many students have shown a great interest                         in synthetic biology.
This communication not only allowed us to look at our projects more seriously and rigorously, but                         also provided some new ideas for the students of the iGEM association, which broadened their                         horizons and inspire them to learn more about synthetic biology. We hoped that our iGEM                         publicity trip would arouse the students’ interest in synthetic biology and contribute to the                         development of the iGEM competition in China.

_____We collaborated with Washington University St. Louis. We first communicated through email and we decided to share our yeast strain with them. We cultured our yeast strain with YPD media overnight. We aliquot drop of cultured yeast on autoclaved filter paper and wrap the filter paper with clean foil. The yeast was delivered to Washington University St. Louis and they successfully obtained the yeast from the filter paper and used the cell for their experiments. We also collaborated with University of California, Santa Cruz. They traveled to our campus during the summer and we guided them to tour our lab and several buildings located on the East Bank of our campus. Then we had a meeting together to share some details of our lab methodologies and human practice preparations. Since we started our project earlier then them, we were able to make some suggestions on plasmid construction and general lab techniques. Team UCSC put a lot of effort in their human practice activities and they showed us their description of their project as a whole. Their Professor also gave us some feedback on our project design, and we did some revisions on this part in the follow up experiments

If we could use bacteria that self-replicate and extract more than 95% of the sulphur – in addition to or lieu of limestone in finite supply – we could lower the environmental impact of this process.
Exploiting the power of the natural environment. Although this term carries many negative connotations, it is not meant in an entirely self-serving sense – rather, if there are bacteria that naturally occur in the depths where oil sands are found, it would be useful to gain an understanding of what they are and what they can do.
This will better support our efforts in engineering an effective biological approach to improving the efficiency and lessening the environmental impact of the oil sands development projects.

Unfortunately, Tyrocidine has high toxicity towards human blood and reproductive cells and can therefore only be used in topical applications [2]. Under  lab-on-a-disc  you can read more about the cytotoxic effects of this as well and other NRPs. The approach is to use the compound's hemolytic properties for developing a screening platform which could be used for screening a big number of samples simultaneously. 
This limitation and its mode of operation as antibiotic makes tyrocidine an interesting target for drug improvement, see Figure 1. Oligo mediated recombineering is a promising tool to create new analogues with reduced toxicity. 
The genes tycA, tycB and tycC encoding the tyrocidine synthetases are located on the tyrocidine operon, which contains three additional open reading frames, labeled tycD, tycE and TycF located downstream of the synthetase genes. The entire operon has a size of 39.5 kb[3].

Experimental Design
Due to the big size of the biosynthetic cluster, an amplification with standard PCR is not feasible. We designed a construct for the expression of tyrocidine which can integrate into the lacA site of Bacillus subtilis, an established model organism. By counter-selection with a toxic gene cassette, the tyrocidine operon can insert into the construct by homologous recombination. The toxic gene is placed under control of the Pxyl promoter, which is repressed by a repressor in the absence of xylose. If xylose is present, the repressor leaves the operon and the toxic gene is transcribed. The construct is flanked by two sequences homologous to the lacA sequence, which allow integration into the genome of Bacillus subtilis.
Since our efforts to express tyrocidine have been hampered by difficulties in assembling all parts, we have"

3) To blank well, add in 200ul of M9+ 0.5% Glucose
4) Set up the plate reader to take OD and RFP readings at 600nm every half hour. (Using script IGEM Fluor Abs but changing measurement protocol to RFP iGEM). Obtain readings overnight.
Note 1: Do a trial run sometime during the day to ensure that the script runs properly (if not your overnight measurements might not give any results!)
Note 2: Readings after 8 hours might not longer be accurate due to evaporation.
5)Determine background absorbance by measuring control well. This should be subtracted from subsequent absorbance readings.
Acorrected = A - Ablank
6) Determine background fluorescence at different ODs from the fluorescence of control cells without a GFP expressing vector. (This experiment has already been done- see IPTG effects on growth) Fluor corrected = Fluor - Fluor cells
7. The data was then converted to absolute units (CFU/well and GFP molecules/well) using the calibration curves described in the calibration assays.
8. The GFP synthesis rate, S, can be described below:
Stotal =dGFP/dt
Scell = Stotal/CFU
9. From modelling, we can calculate PoPS(t)
where
PoPS(t) is the time dependent rate of mRNA synthesis
Scell is the GFP synthesis rate per cell  (GFP over time / Cell no)
gammaI is the degradation rate of immature GFP (incorporating degradation and dilution due to cell growth)
gammaM is the degradation rate of mRNA
a is the maturation rate of GFP
rho is the constant rate of protein synthesis per mRNA

9th - 11th May 2012 4th Annual Meeting of Senior Experts of Chemistry (GDCh)
After the project of the iGEM team of TU Darmstadt stood firm and the beginning of lab work came up, the team had the opportunity to present their project to the elder people. The Society for German Chemists (GDCh) organizes every year a meeting of senior experts in chemistry. At this congress, the team could occur with three posters and convince the elderly from their project ""Next Generation Recycling"". The project met with great interest, and there were long discussions about costs and feasibility of it. It was not unusual that present chemists themselves were involved in the production of plastics or on the other hand developed new chemical-based recycling processes on it. Many did not know the way of seeing things with the view of biology yet and were surprised what opportunities this new view offered. The iGEM team quickly realized that it is not easy to convince a chemist from biology. It was easy to explain the degradation of the polymer with its chemical structure, but it is more difficult to explain genetics and even more the BioBrick system. Nonetheless was the presentation a huge success and they were able to convince the elder people of the idea. It was not only convincing the people for the project, but also the discussion about the new topic of Synthetic Biology, which is a contrary topic in Germany. It was important for the team to achieve not only one group of residents in Germany but as many as possible. For the team it was necessary to inform the people about new scientific technologies in a true and open way. Chemists, who are still working and dealing with the recycling of waste, came to the team and wanted to know, if the project could be extended to other substances. It turns out that the method of bioremediation is not used in its maximum manner and there are a lot more tasks outside to deal with. So the project of the iGEM team of Darmstadt is a hint into to the future and could soon find its application.

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Acknowledgement_-_-_TEXT.html,". Embedding method is the most common one to realize bacterial immobilization. Immobilizing living bacteria in carrier like sodium alginate, cellulose and agar, etc., increases the density and survival time of them, as well as reduces the flow of bacteria into natural environment. Our team produces immobilized E. coli by embedding the sensor bacteria in polyvinyl alcohol/sodium alginate (PVA/SA) beads.(UCAS-APPLICATION-DESIGN-1)
We planned to breed our immobilized bacteria in fish pond water, but as our analysis of fish pond water shows, in nutrition in fish pond water is limited and cannot meet the demand of our engineered bacteria. Therefore, we changed our plan and decided to breed bacteria in our nitrogen limited M9 culture medium, mixed with fish pond water. Nevertheless, our technique in immobilization might have further use since we are still seeking for a better solution.
Pumping System
The equipment contains a detection system, a pumping system, a control system and a battery. In order to properly inject water, a peristaltic pump is employed to inject 1.5mL pool water into the detecting cell, and another pump will pump it out once the detection process finishes. The second pump delivers the water to a cup and, considering the potential danger of escaping bacteria, a microporous filter at the top of the cup.
Detection System
Detection part mainly consists of a detecting cell, a LED and a photoresistor. In our first plan, we planned to applied bacterial immobilizing technique. Firstly the polyvinyl alcohol/sodium alginate (PVA/SA) beads with immobilized E. coli soak in the water in the detecting cell for approximately 5 hours. Thus the promoter begins to respond to the concentration of nitrogen, and then RFP gene is expressed if the concentration is below the threshold. A 585nm-595nm LED is applied to excite red fluorescence and a photoresistor are used to detect the fluorescence. The detecting cell is the only consumable item in the whole equipment. In our second plan, we will breed our bacteria in nitrogen limited M9 culture medium for approximately 5 hours, then inject the fish pond water to mix with the culture medium. It will take 2-3 hours before the GFP being expressed and detected.
Control System
To ensure that the hardware perform properly, a control system was designed. We used a small circuit board to control the relays and the Bluetooth module. The relays’ opening or closure makes different parts in the equipment start or stop working at proper time. And the Bluetooth module sends the"

CB Bottom Library Preliminary Sequencing Results
Recap of what has happened:
After the CB bottom library was transformed into (turbocomp or selection strain?) cells, 94 colonies were picked off of the plate after transformation.  These colonies were then sequenced, with the eventual objective of determining several factors about our transformed library:
How much spread does our library cover?  Theoretically, the 94 colonies should be evenly spread throughout the "
Bielefeld-CeBiTec,2017,Team:Bielefeld-CeBiTec#Results#unnatural base pair#uptake_-_-_TEXT.html," ATP is exported. Therefore, uptake of iso-dCmTP and iso-dGTP leads to a constant loss of ATP, negatively influencing growth. If the media is supplemented with ATP in slightly higher concentrations than the intracellular concentration, ATP is likely taken up in exchange for ATP, ADP as well as other NTPs. This would lead to a small net uptake of ATP, and therefore to a beneficial effect of expression of the transporter on the growth of the cells. In case of much higher extracellular concentrations compared to the intracellular concentration of ATP, ATP will be taken up efficiently in exchange for NTPs, ADP and AMP. This would lead to a net uptake of ATP, but a net loss of NTPs, leading to reduced growth.        For the first part of the experiment, two sets of cultivations were carried out in parallel. All transporter variants as well as two negative controls, E. coli BL21(DE3) and E. coli BL21(DE3) pSB1C3-PtNTT2, were cultivated in MOPS minimal media containing either 1,32 mM K2HPO4 or 1 mM ATP as sole phosphate source. Three biological replicates of each strain were cultivated in 1 mL of media in a 12 well plate at 37 °C and 600 rpm. For each measurement point, three technical replicates were measured. Figure 10 shows the growth curves of the cultivations carried out with 1,32 mM of K2HPO4 as the sole phosphate source.
Figure 10: Cultivation of all transporter variants in MOPS media with K2HPO4 acting as the sole phosphate source.
The cultivation was carried out in 12 well plates and three biological replicates were cultivated of each strain. For measurement of the optical density at 600 nm, three technical replicates were taken.
The final OD600 values varied widely, with E. coli BL21(DE3) pSB1C3-PlacUV5-pelB-SP-PtNTT2 reaching the highest OD600 of 3.907 ± 0.018. The lowest OD600 was reached by E. coli BL21(DE3) pSB1C3-PlacUV5-PtNTT2 with a value of 1.537 ± 0.045. All final optical densities at 600 nm are shown in Table 7.

Proof of Concept
Overview
Our intended final product was a protein cage capable of disassembling due to specific proteolytic cleavage. This would disassemble the cage, exposing the inside of the cage and its contents to the environment where the targeted enzyme was in.
Using Protein Cage Mutants
We demonstrated proof of concept using thrombin as our targeted enzyme, and successfully mutated thrombin cleavage sites into a variety of positions along two protein cages, O3-33 and PCQuad.
Not all of these mutations yielded viable cages however. Some caused the subunits of the cage to no longer be compatible, preventing formation of the cage, and some caused the subunits of the cage not to form in the first place.
One mutant for each of the cages yielded properly formed cages, with nearly identical characteristics to their respective wild types.
We mixed a solution of each of these wild types with thrombin, allowing them to incubate for 16 hours at room temperature. Additionally, we created an identical mixture with the same conditions using the wild types of each cage as a control.
Assay Results
Detailed results can be found here
After the incubation period, we ran DLS and SDS-PAGE assays to determine the effects of the added thrombin. The wild types had no change, while the mutants showed clear signs of cleavage.
We further ran time variation experiments of the same thrombin assay. This involved allowing the thrombin-protein mixture to incubate for 4 hours, 8 hours, 12 hours, and 16 hours. The longer the period of time, the more cleavage that occurred, as could be seen from the intensity of bands representing the unaffected subunits (fading over time) and the cleaved subunits (intensifying over time).
DLS Results for PCQuad Mutant M1 before addition of thrombin and after addition of thrombin:
DLS Results for PCQuad Mutant M1 before addition of thrombin and after addition of thrombin:
Explanation of Results
All of these results pointed to the explanation that thrombin was indeed causing subunit level cleavage in the proteins at the added cleavage sites, as expected. DLS results further confirmed that the subunit level cleavage was disrupting the formation of the full cage.
These results thus demonstrate that specifically through the addition of a targeted enzyme, we"

These sequences will be incorporated as new biobricks to the registry and will be used to construct the next assemblies (figures 14 and 15).
CAUTION!!!, the previous sequences are intended to generate a RNA secondary structure after transcription. In DNA synthesis, a similar structure may be formed causing problems. To overcome this problem we, with the recommendations of some members of Berkeley iGEM 2006 , Caltech iGEM 2007 and Peking iGEM 2007 , developed a basic protocol for Lock/key synthesis .
Figure 14. Characterization of lock and key for medium RBS ( B0032 ). Before IPTG induction, GFP will be transcribed but due to the lock the translation will be blocked. After IPTG addition, the production of the key will start and the expression of GFP will lead to fluorescence. The construction was made using the Biobricks R0010 , B0015 , R0040 , J04630 and the new biobricks designed here (LM: lock for medium RBS and KM: key for LM) in a Cloranphenicol biobrick backbone pSB1C"

Release rate (sexyplant)
The range of search that we have considered is a little wider than the one for the release rate of females.
References: It generally has been found that pheromone dispensers releasing the chemicals above a certain emission rate will catch fewer males. The optimum release rate or dispenser load for trap catch varies greatly among species [4].  This certain emission rate above which male start to get confused could be the release rate from females.

Moth sensitivity
This is a parameter referred to the capability of the insect to detect changes in pheromone concentration in the patch it is located and the neighbor patch. When the field becomes more homogeneous, an insect with higher sensitivity will be more able to follow the gradients.
Range: 0-0.0009
(The maximum level of moth sensitivity has to be less than the minimum level of release rate of females, since this parameter is obtained from the difference)

Population
The number of males and females can be selected by the observer.
Ticks (time step) !!!
We’ll consider the equivalence 20 ticks= 1 hour.  That is 1 tick = 3 minutes.
Patches !!!
The approximate velocity of a male moth flying towards the female in natural environment is 0.3 m/sec [6].  Each moth moves 1 patch per tick, so if 1 tick is equal to 3 minutes (180 sec), the patch is 54 meter long to get that velocity.
One can modify the number of patches that conform the field so as to analyze its own case.

We did a check PCR on several cryo cultures. All samples with G00100_Alternative+K1319004_check_R combinations resulted in a strong band at ~2300 bp that we cannot explain. All G00100_Alternative+K1319004_check_R combinations resulted in a strong band at 900 bp that we cannot explain either. We concluded that the annealing temperatures were wrong and favored unspecific products. Therefore, we decided to do a gradient PCR to find out the optimal annealing temperatures for our new primers.

Why a ""Cobalt Buster"" biofilter in nuclear power plants ?
Why not in the primary circuit ?
Where to use ""Cobalt Buster"" ?
Other prospects for the ""Cobalt Buster"" project ?
To go further : Economic analysis of the electronuclear pattern
Team brainstorming
After several months of reflection and review of the scientific literature, the ""Cobalt Buster"" biofilter was born as a filter dedicated to the primary water circuit of nuclear power plants !
Back to the top
Why a ""Cobalt Buster"" biofilter in nuclear power plants ?
1-
It is known that a pulse of radioactive Cobalt emission occurs in the primary circuit of water, during the maintenance of nuclear power plants when they open the reactor core. This pulse damages the ion exchange resins used to filter the water and reduce its radioactive level.
2-
A major concern of the nuclear industry is the reduction of waste volume and a previous modeling estimated that the ""Cobalt Buster"" strain is very efficient (Appl Microbio Biotechnol 2009 81:571- 578):
4 kg of modified bacteria = 8000 kg of ion exchange resins
3-
Drastic reduction of the costs of waste processing and conditioning is also a major issue for nuclear industry. The production of biofilters is less expensive and the biofilter may prevent damage caused to the resins. It could significantly reduce costs of rehabilitation of primary circuit wastewater.
4-
Maintenance phases generate a shortfall of millions of euros and reduction of the duration of maintenance phases represent a major issue.
5-
Storage stations of moderately radioactive waste are rapidly full. Our bacteria could help in downgrading the high volumes of high radioactive waste to low radioactive waste, which are stocked in other stations, usually more spacious. Radioactive cobalt would be concentrated in smaller volumes thanks to the increase of the efficiency of filtration.
Back to the top
Why not in the primary circuit ? (Experts advice)
To include our project into a realistic approach and close to concerns of today and tomorrow's engineers, we notably have discussed the realization of our biofilter with M. Brette (Assistant professor in INSA"

The time cell division of E. coli is function of factors such as pressure, temperature and culture medium  and ranging from 20-30 min under optimal conditions. Culturing in universal  common medium such as Nutrient Broth and Luria-Bertani at 35 ℃, the time cell division can be assumed to be 30  min.8,9,10
The half life of mRNAs in E. coli has been well reported by Bernstein and coworkers who determined that it  depends of culture medium. In, LB 99% of mRNAs had a half-life time between  1-15 min with a mean of 5.2 min.11 Therefore, 5.2 min can be assumed as the  half-life time of CBD cipA -BMP2 mRNA. Consequently, δ[CB]= 0.226 min-1.
In E. coli , the translation takes place at 12-21 amino  acids per second (aa s-1).12 We choose 19 aa s-1 because  the codon optimization. Because CBD cipA-BMP2 contains 292 aa, β[CB] can be taken to be 3.904 min-1.The  half life of CBD cipA-BMP2 protein can be assumed to be 60 min-1, 13 consequently,  σ[CB]= 0.05min-1:

pJEJAM2 BBa_K678050
pJEJAM2 is a plasmid intended for transient transfection of mammalian cells. The expression of GFP is under the control of the strong constitutive CMV promoter (see the figure below). The peroxisomal targeting signal PTS1 is directly fused to the C-terminal of GFP, this sequence should ensure the localization of GFP to the peroxisomes of the cell. Although the microscopy shows GFP distributed in points, further analysis are necessary to confirm that GFP is in fact is targeted to the peroxisomes.
U-2 OS cells transiently transfected with pJEJAM2 expressing GFP localized to the peroxisomes. As can be seen on the picture this vector most likely localizes GFP to the peroxisomes of the cells. The white bar has a length of 30μm.

- KK Results from our overnight cholera preps: The first three tubes from the left are controls, one with pure LB, one with cholera + LB (which was grown at 30 degrees by the other subgroup), and one with E.Coli + LB, respectively. The fourth and fifth tubes have cholera, E.Coli, and LB. The fourth has a slightly greater number of cholera (500 microL of cholera-saturated broth) compared to the fifth (100 microL of cholera-saturated broth). These are the results after two days of shaker-incubation at 30 degrees C, when the cultures are viewed under UV light. We went over the quorum-sensing circuit with Dr. Grose. The Cqss membrane receptor phosphorylates Lux U, which cascades phosphorylation to LuxO. LuxO, when phosphorylated, binds to the Qrr4 promoter, activating transcription of Qrr4 mRNA. Qrr4 mRNA interferes with HapR, so there is no protein HapR. HapR is a repressor whose binding site is at the promoter for GFP. When Qrr4 eliminates HapR, there is no repression of the expression of GFP. Thus, GFP should be ON when Cholera is NOT present. The reverse is also true. In the presence of Cholera autoinducer, CQSS acts as a phophatase on LuxU, which does the same to LuxO, which does NOT activate Qrr4 mRNA which does NOT degrade HapR which represses transcription of GFP. Thus GFP should NOT glow in the presence of cholera. Our results in these test tubes aren’t exactly in agreement with what we want.
- KP Today we worked on our presentation for Friday and we also went over the quorum sensing with Dr. Grose.
-CH We worked on our final presentation for this semester. I am focusing on the quorum sensing system in Cholera and how we have modified it in E.coli. There is still some confusion on the HapR responsive promoter the other students added to the modified QS. Is it just the HapR promoter? Is it negatively or positively responsive to HapR? HapR represses its own promoter. (see Regulatory targets of quorum sensing in Vibrio cholerae: evidence for two distinct HapR-binding motifs Amy M. Tsou1, Tao Cai2, Zhi Liu1, Jun Zhu1,* and Rahul V.

After the Asia Jamboree, we continued with the molecular cloning job and have successfully cloned the original coding sequence of cas3 and cascade into two biobricks, BBa_K786032 and BBa_K786033 . Here is the electrophotoresis result after they are digested by EcoRI and SpeI.
To evaluate whether the RSR system transformed into E. coli can degrade genomic DNA and eventually lead to cell death, we measured OD600 of cell cultures every 0.5 h and plotted the growth curves of transformed E. coli (indicated as solid lines) with or without 0.4 mM IPTG activation. Paired t-test showed that there is no significant difference in OD600 throughput the whole experiment with or without RSR activation by IPTG.
The result agrees with the percentage of survival (indicated as dashed lines) derived from live/dead fluorescent staining assay (Invitrogen) measuring bacterial apoptotic-like rate, which showed no difference in survival percentage with or without RSR activation. It was expected that the survival percentage drops significantly after IPTG induction. Further optimization of design of the RSR region and experimental conditions is required for more specific targeting.

IV. Impact
A. Cleavage of selected biobrick
Our proposed system can be utilized as a new safety approach for synthetic biology, especially for iGEMers. As we know, one of the most concerned safety issues in engineering cells is that the leakage of bacteria with transformed plasmid that may cause environmental pollution. As it was proved that CRISPR system can target on plasmid DNA sequence, our system may also function as a tool for biobrick cleavage. Specifically, this tool can be used for targeting and cleaving the antibiotic resistance genes present on the biobricks or the standard site of the biobrick such as prefix, suffix, in order to prevent horizontal gene transfer caused by DNA fragments released from apoptotic pathways. Our system has the potential to be applied as a tool to provide a higher level of the safety control of engineered microorganism machine starting from DNA level.
B, Self-targeting of Engineered Bacteria
Our biobrick has a potential application of cleaving the genome sequence of certain bacteria as selected, which can function as a novel approach to deal with the new safety issue in synthetic biology"

Sheffield,2016,Team:Sheffield#project#device#microfluids_-_-_TEXT.html," time they enter the final channel, they could mix via diffusion within the smaller width of the channel. When the fluid flows from the mixing chamber to the final chamber, the reduction in width of the channel promotes the fluid to reach the end chamber. This is important as one of the problems we faced in the lab was the fluid stopping in the final chamber mid-way before reaching the end.
Figure 6. Diagram (top view) of mixing design 3 containing a large mixing chamber. The yellow and blue fluids should mix within the mixing chamber.
This design has already been shown to work in the lab before and thus should be more foolproof. However, there might be difficulty controlling when the 2 solutions mix, thus potentially resulting in one solution entering the end chamber before the mixed solution does. Since the blood can enter the last chamber without any adverse effects on the bacterial cells and the results obtained, this disadvantage can be mitigated by adding the blood before adding the siderophore-iron solution into their respective inlet chambers.
The Results
Design 1: The Capillary Stop Valve Idea
Capillary stop valves have been shown to work in literature3 but did not seem to work in our lab. We assume this is due to the quality of the PDMS chip produced when using our equipment and protocol4.
Figure 7 contains a photo of our result. The yellow solution, which represented the stock solution, did not stay in the chamber and flowed out into the main channel instead. Thus, it had to be quickly added after the red solution, representing the blood sample. The addition of the yellow solution had to be timed perfectly, as the red solution had the tendency to flow into both chambers. As can be seen from the photo, there is some leakage of red solution into the inlet chamber containing the yellow solution.
Figure 7. Photo showing the result of mixing design 1. Red food colouring representing the blood is added in the leftmost chamber, while yellow food colouring representing the stock solution is added in the middle chamber. Both fluids flowed towards rightmost end chamber.
The two solutions are not fully mixed by the time they reach the end chamber. The channel between the end chamber and the yellow chamber should have been longer and/or narrower to allow mixing via diffusion to take place.
Design 2: The Well Idea
Overall, the results indicate that the design did not work as expected.
In the first test, with a well of 4 mm diameter, blue dye from the inlet chamber entered the well and sank to the bottom. When the well was eventually filled, the yellow dye at the top of the well was pushed"

Commercialize a novel system for saving lives
With such an innovative system of synthetic communication between microorganisms dedicated to fight cholera, an ongoing human health issue, it would be a nonsense not to exploit it for saving lives.
In this part of the project, our team developed an approach to commercialize our system. To achieve this goal, we first collected testimonies on two topics:
a reflexion on the prototype:  how can we best adapt and optimize our system to the current cholera epidemics?
an entrepreneurship reflexion: how to set up a company? What shall be our values?
We therefore met successful entrepreneurs in the field of biotechnology and business developer (Marc Lemonnier from the start-up Antabio, Pierre Monsan from Toulouse White Biotechnology, Pierre-Alain Hoffmann from the CRITT Bio-Industries), people that developed a business to treat water, especially from V. cholerae (Christophe Campéri-Ginestet from Sunwaterlife), humanitarians from NGOs that daily face cholera (Claire Salvador, Francisco Luquero from Doctors Without Borders and bAlama Keita from UNICEF) and finally, more generally to Westerners. These rich discussions have helped us to deeply understand the cholera context and to adapt our positioning in a viable way for us and sustainable for our targeted users.
Consequently, a scope statement has been established, detailing the functional and technical features of our product.
In parallel, an ethical matrix was built to highlight the important features to work on and to provide a decision tool so that our system is ethically acceptable.
Then, we had to conceive the device following as closely as possible the scope statement: How to best contain GMMs? How to make user-friendly a device? What materials can be used to combine quality and price? Once again, the testimonies and the ethical matrix helped us to reflect about that. Besides, diffusion tests were carried out by our team to choose the best materials of the device."

SMITe - The Concept: Our Path
A Project is Born
We are delighted to say that from it’s inception, our project has benefitted from being a truly shared endeavour; one which we cannot wait to show you.
Following initial selection of the team members, we undertook a series of small group exercises which merged team building with the generation of new ideas. Once these were narrowed down to several per group, we tested the ease with which each group could present an unknown idea to the rest of the team. This was a very revealing experiment in terms of the generalisability of an idea, as well as how marketable each one could be.
It became clear rapidly that the team were stuck between a focus on biomaterials and health, and it was alongside the opportunity to work with recombinant spider silk that our final project plan evolved, joining these two fields perfectly.
Chronic Wounds
Chronic wounds are a major source of disability and high cost for healthcare systems worldwide, not to mention pain, misery and the continual threat of infection for the affected individual. Referred to as a “snowballing threat to public health”,  chronic wound sufferers have been aptly described as “carriers of a silent epidemic”, who are often already diagnosed with “highly branded” diseases including diabetes and obesity. [1] In the current context of these conditions twinned with an aging population, the trend in chronic wounds is set only to rise. We decided to approach this clinical problem using Staphylococcus aureus biofilm as a model. Since this organism is part of our skin flora, it benefits from easy access to broken skin and easily becomes established in non healing wounds; it is suggested that S.aureus is present in more than 90% chronic wounds. [2]
A Look Beyond
In addition, questions on a pressing global public health threat are raised by our project: antimicrobial resistance.  It is well established that bacterial biofilms, fostered by the chronic wound environment, protect bacteria from both antibiotics and an individual’s immune system, generating the perfect backdrop for increasing drug resistance. [1] We could not fail to acknowledge the intrinsic link between this world issue and"

One cool functionality of the screen is that it can recognize marker codes, and we are planning to use these marker codes for our tangibles. However, there was still some issues with the screen recognizing the markers correctly, so we tried messing around with the settings. However, that didn’t seem to help much. We are hoping that we will figure this out soon.  We went out towards the end of work to get some ice cream at JP licks.

Today we worked more on the functionality of the prototype. We also went to the program wide seminar. A Wellesley alum talked about her chemistry career, and it was very inspiring.
6/25/2015: Day 18
We continued to work on the functionality of the prototype. We had some doubts about the current prototype because it was not taking full advantage of the multitaction screens and the capabilities that come along with the screens. One downside about our current prototype is that it is not collaborative or multi-user and only one user can interact with the screen at a time. This did not make sense to me because one our main goals when we were brainstorming with Romie and Anja was that we needed a collaborative space. We asked Orit about our concerns, and he agreed with us as well. I think we are going to overhaul or initial design and start brainstorming again for a new layout!  We also filled out iGEM forms that are due tomorrow. Super excited about iGEM!!!!
6/26/2015: Day 19
The first of our interns came today! Melissa is a sophomore in high school. She is super cool and seemed to be excited to hang out and work with us in the HCI lab. Today, we worked on multiple sketches of our exhibit. One thing that I really emphasized in the layout is having individual workspaces and a shared space that is collaborative. I think Sam and Vivien liked this idea as well, so I think we are going to proceed in this direction. Lauren, one of the Wellesley alums working in the lab, also brought some very cool ideas to the table such as introducing duplication and status bars. In addition, Mike Horn from NorthWestern came to visit us in the lab. He showed us some really cool exhibits and games that he created, and he also gave us a lot of feedback on our current prototypes. He also referred us to a lot of papers for us to read about interactive museum spaces and tabletops.

UTP-Panama,2011,Team:UTP-Panama#Human Practice_-_-_TEXT.html," make our own project of SynBio as part of the iGEM Competition, work that led us to ask ourselves how to bring it on the best possible way, but it also appear the question of whether we were leaving something behind or if we were not covering all the aspects that we should really worry about. At this moment came the question of safety due, which made us wonder about all the institutions and agencies that should be around a draft synbio.
Then our advisors began the labor of introducing us on the issue of the implications of SynBio in all aspects of society, and they also provided reading materials as the Presidential Commission for the Study of Bioethical Issues Repor (PCSBI) called ""New Directions: The Ethics of Synthetic Biology and Emerging Technologies""[1] or the ""Ethical Issues on Synthetic Biology""[2]. In particular, the recommendation on PCSBI left us with a some questions to solve.
From these reflections, readings and the realization of our project was born the ideas to do the outreach on synthetic biology to the inner of our university, but especially it was born from the vision of creating two tools:
a) Introducing into the field of SynBio and its basic subjects to the ones that are not familiar with this science, for which we proposed the creation of the SB UTP 1.0
b) Help people who needs to develop SynBio project at all levels, with a self-assessment tool and guidance on the most relevant aspects that you need to consider for which your project is within the regulatory, ethical, moral or institutional field, but primarily to discover what are the realities that exist around them (environment) for advancing or hindering the development of your project. Our solution for this aspect is the creation of the SB UTP PROJECT 1.0
The Problem
In our role as iGEMers, we faced many issues to develop synthetic biology in our country. Some of them were:
1. Explain and introduce what is synthetic biology at all levels of society, emphasizing the engineers.
2. Planning a synthetic biology project.
3. Be able to find all the availability of institutions and the clear regulatory frame to develop our endevour.
4. Be able to cover all the implications and possibilities that synthetic biology brings to the human civilization, both positive and negative.

For both samples, 6 technical replicates were measured. Representative measurements of each sample are shown in Figure 6. All data can be found here . For all measurements, the reaction rate constants were determined as explained above and are shown in Figure 7. This figure shows that in the presence of Cry3Aa, the kf values are higher and thus the fluorophores are released faster. Overall, fluorophore leaking in the presence of Cry3Aa is accelerated with a factor of 1.59 compared to fluorophore leaking in the absence of Cry3Aa. Unless one of the other few proteins still present in the sample would unexpectedly interfere with the experiment, Cry3Aa induces leakage of carboxyfluorescein from T. molitor BBMV's.
Figure 7. A boxplot shows the kf values that represent the velocity at which fluorophore release occurs for BBMV's obtained from T. molitor in the presence and absence of Cry3Aa.
A library of Cry3Aa proteins with mutations in the three different binding sites was made to create a Cry toxin that is potentially toxic to V. destructor. When one of these mutant Cry3Aa proteins is toxic to V. destructor, the toxin should induce leakage of carboxyfluorescein from V. destructor BBMV's, and therefore have a higher kf value than the negative control. The influence of Cry3Aa on T. molitor vesicles can be used as a positive control. The process of optimization of the positive control can be found in the notebook . It should be noted, however, that the relationship between the effect of the Cry toxin on vesicles and the Cry toxin on the whole organism might be different for each organism.  To know with certainty whether a certain Cry toxin is lethal for V. destructor, an in vivo test should be performed.
Toxin Engineering
As mentioned above, no specific toxin to Varroa mites is known. To overcome this limitation, we tried to engineer one. We used the Cry3Aa toxin as a starting point.This toxin is known to be effective against a number of Coleoptera as the Colorado potato beetle Leptinotarsa decemlineata and the mealworm T. molitor. This toxin was also shown to be active against 4 different types of mites (Acarus siro L., Tyrophagus putrescentiae, Dermatophagoides farinae Hughes, and Lepidoglyphus destructor) 1 . This engineering focused on two different strategies"

Public Talk: An Introduction to Synthetic Biology
As a team, we were conscious that we didn’t want to focus all of our public engagement activities on the younger generation alone. Understandably, when members of the public hear short, sensationalist media stories regarding genetic engineering, they can feel overwhelmed by the science and streams of technical jargon. This lack of understanding can in turn make them fearful of the technology.
Elsa and Amy spent the day in Leamington Spa, conducting surveys and trying to find out more about some of the public opinions surrounding genetic engineering. The results can be seen on our Human Practices page.
Participants of the survey were also invited to attend a public talk on synthetic biology and its applications; from GMO crops to lab-grown skin. We ensured that the lecture didn’t contain lots of technical terminology, and there were plenty of opportunities for audience members to ask any questions that they had. Before the lecture, approximately 62.5% of those surveyed stated that they were worried by media stories and the concept of synthetic biology. We asked the same question afterwards, and this figure fell to just 28%. This highlights the fact that a lot of the resistance surrounding genetic engineering is due to a lack of understanding and public perception, which cannot be underestimated.
Without a transparent and well-informed dialogue between the public and the scientific community, we risk damaging the public support upon which scientific enterprise is built. For this reason, it is imperative that ongoing research is conducted in a socially and ethically responsible manner.

Café Scientifique
Cafe Scientifique is a place where, for the price of a cup of coffee or a glass of wine, anyone can come and explore the latest ideas in science and technology. Meetings take place in cafes, bars, restaurants and even theatres, but always outside a traditional academic context. Attendees may not necessarily have a strong understanding of scientific principles, and so the it is up to the presenters to make their talk as accessible as possible. The sessions foster an informal atmosphere where all participants feel encouraged to participate.
Our Cafe Scientifique evening took place in Leamington Spa, and began with us asking the audience members to complete a short survey in an attempt to understand the current levels of knowledge about the field of synthetic biology, along with personal opinions.

Another potential danger would be the requirement of working with a small quantity of bodily fluid to operate  the device. Any bodily fluid must be treated as a potential source of disease transfer between the patient and others.
Do any of the new Biobrick parts (or devices) that you made this year raise any safety issues?
The LacZ omega fragment Biobrick that we submitted is a commonly used reporter in synthetic biology. It encodes a version of beta galactosidase which is only functional when paired with the beta galactosidase alpha fragment. The full beta galactosidase enzyme is classified as a non-hazardous substance under GHS and HCS standards (4).
Is there a local biosafety group, committee, or review board at your institution? If yes, what does your local biosafety group think about your project?
There is no body specifically focused on overseeing biosafety hazards. The University of Michigan’s Department of Occupational Safety and Environmental Health reviewed the team’s laboratory and practices multiple times, and found that our lab space met their requirements for safety. Before our team started doing lab work, all our members were  trained in laboratory safety and instrument handling in accordance with University of Michigan requirements.
How could parts, devices and systems be made even safer through biosafety engineering? Do you have any other ideas how to deal with safety issues that could be useful for future iGEM competitions?
With a mass produced product that is based on exposed synthetic genes, there is a small chance of natural transformation by environmental bacteria. The products that would come from these genes’ expression are harmless, but to prevent mutation and spreading of these genes a simple failsafe was designed. Inspired by The Chinese University of Hong Kong’s 2012 project that featured a safety component that targets DNA using CRISPR (1). Our design is more simplistic; it relies on the weak expression of DNase I. University Oxford’s 2015 project included a part for DNase I and the necessary chaperone peptide (DbsA) (2). Using a weak promoter to slowly build up the enzymes concentration should not destroy the main template until after it has finished expression. The University of California, Berkeley 2006 iGEM documented a list of promoters and their relative strength and submitted them as parts (3). If it is decided to use this system, several different promoters could be tested with the DNase part in order to find the right level of expression.
A DNase-based suicide gene has applications with any cell-free synthetic gene network. It is almost every organism that comes"
Botchan_Lab_Tokyo,2018,Team:Botchan Lab Tokyo#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html," our projects, we did a survey about awareness of food problem and genetic modified food to teams from different countries such as Australia, Brazil, Chile, China, Ecuador, Egypt, Japan, Mexico, the USA and so on. Also, we did a survey to people who are family or friends of our team members. As a result, we could collect answer from 341 people. We would like to take this opportunity to express our appreciation to you all.
Our project focus on food problem, and we think many people who live in wealthy countries don’t take it seriously about the food problem. Therefore, we tried hard to make the general public pay attention to food problem. Through our survey, we are surprised how many people think their countries don’t feel a sense of danger about the food problem. Even if many people have learned about food problem in their school class, they don’t have a chance to think deeply about food problem. Also, even if they learned something about the problem, they don’t think they have a possibility of suffering from shortage of food. Therefore, our human practice activities and project could cause the general public to pay attention to food problem, and rethink about the problem. Also, through activities we use synthetic biology, and that were good opportunity to spread synthetic biology.
We also took a survey about genetically modified food. Since we aren’t familiar with genetically modified food, we thought many people think it is dangerous to eat genetically modified food. As a result, almost half of the people who answered survey don’t think it is dangerous, but more than half of the people have some barriers to eating genetically modified food. In reality, if there is a few people who think it is dangerous to eat the one, we are difficult to put our project to practical use, because we can’t get any money to continue our project toward more practical way. In order to get them to understand it is safe, we need to give a course. In this year, we made many chances to promote genetically modified and we think it is really valuable time for the general public to learn the one.
However, we think our activities are not enough to solve the problem which is to decrease people who have negative impression to genetically modified food. We think if we  interview researcher who have same problem as us, we can get valuable advice, and improve our project. Therefore, we visited National Agriculture and Food Research Organization(NARO), and interviewed researcher whose research is related to genetically modified food. We think

Lanzhou,2016,Team:Lanzhou#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," is essential to address the problem of mercury contamination in fish.
Common Solutions
s there nothing to do about it? The answer is definitely yes. Recently, several methods such as biosorption, ecoremedations, bioremediation, and phytoremediation have been utilized in attempts to reduce heavy metal pollution from contaminated environments. Although these approaches are used in small scale sites such as waste water plants, they are incapable of effective action in a vast marine environment. Therefore, a new strategy to address this problem needs to be developed.
An important strategy for managing pollution is finding the most effective method and technologies for heavy metal treatment. There are some techniques and methods for eliminating or reducing heavy metal pollution in the environment. However, some studies have reported levels of heavy metals in fish greater than the permissible WHO limit. Moreover, research on intestinal microorganisms is currently receiving a great deal of attention. Gut microbiota such as E. coli play an important role in maintaining health. . An effective method to reduce accumulation of heavy metals is the use of E. coli to break down the heavy metal; currently, there are few reports on this method.
A New Strategy-Gut Remediation
It has been reported that chemically synthesized peptides produced by the Tang Yu research group of Lanzhou University could bind to heavy metals; these peptides possess affinity for binding heavy metals. Thus, we attempted to use bacteria to synthesize such peptides anchored on the cell membrane. Importantly, the surface display strategy for heavy metal adsorption has an advantage over traditional bioadsorption methods due to the burden of intracellular accumulation of toxics metal ions.
Advantage
Compared with chemical synthesis, bacterial synthetic peptides are cheaper and environmental friendly. Herein, we present a new method for the selective removal of mercury by peptides, coded by a novel gene displayed on the cells, which will be able to contribute to the future. The resulting engineered E. coli, with high mercury affinity and selectivity, bind to mercury. Engineering strains of adsorption heavy metals can reduce fish intestinal mercury levels through their feed. Thus, engineering strains indirectly reduces mercury contamination in fish.
Metal Catcher
In this year, we are inspired by this idea and we designed a mercury-specific binding peptide, IC (Cys- lys- Cys- lys- Cys- lys- Cys), termed metal catcher (MC), which has a high affinity and selectivity toward mercury. The subsequent IC and GFP (Green Fluorescent Protein) were fused and displayed on Escherichia coli cell surface by using an N-terminal region ice nucleation protein (INP) anchor.

My interests are diverse (evolution, music, visual arts, robotics, artificial intelligence, and more) but at the root of them all is my interest in creativity. I am constantly in awe of the creative power of evolution and the astounding diversity of the life on our little planet.  What better way to learn more about the the inner workings of the living things around us than to tinker with them and reassemble their parts in new and strange (hopefully useful) ways? I very excited to be a part of the iGEM team and participate in the development of new tools and methods in the field of Synthetic Biology.  I hope to continue researching in this area beyond my undergrad, and ultimately use these tools for the creation of microbial robots.

Catalog for regulatory RNAs
Over the years, the number of regulatory RNAs in Part Registry has steadily increased over time and many has been made available to end users. Based on different mode actions and natures of regulatory RNAs, they can be grouped into different categories. However, the Part Registry currently does not have a catalog page, categorizing methods or guidelines to organize and curate existing regulatory RNAs. Some of them are grouped under type ""RNA"", while others are not. This is not useful for looking up and utilizing them.Over the years, the number of non-coding RNAs in Part Registry has increased steadily over time and many have been made available to end users. More than 400 entries in the Part Registry are related to RNA devices (updated 25-12-2014). Based on different mode of actions and natures of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), they can be grouped under different categories. However, the Part Registry currently does not have a catalog page, categorizing methods or guidelines to organize and curate existing ncRNAs. Some of them are simply grouped under type ""RNA"", while others are not. This is not useful for looking up and utilizing them. For example, BBa_K145013, which is a part for antisense LuxI, could be used to add an extra layer of control to the widely utilized quorum sensing Lux pathway but it has not been extensively reused. It is likely that Part Registry users are unaware of its existence because there has yet to be an information hub for ncRNA.
We would like to solve this problem by designing a list of category tags as well as a guideline, so that automated display of non-coding RNAs by the
function can be facilitated. By doing so, we hope that we can assist other users to find and use those parts efficiently. Ultimately we want to facilitate the implementation"

Checking the insert of promoters
We ligated promoters into death vector, and transforned into Top 10. Our transformation worked, but it was hard to say with the result of yesterday if we had the good insert. Moreover, it is possible that we inverted Pupp and Pspac. So we are going to make a new single colony PCR with the primers of promoters (we used the same single colonies than yesterday).
We also want to PCR again all promoters (Pspac, Pxyl, Pupp and Ppac) from plasmids to have more.

Retinal Production
Decided that we would try to make our bacteria synthesize retinal endogenously.
Designed a new BioBrick around the ninaB gene from D. melanogaster, which has shown to produce a beta-carotene 15,15'-monooxygenase [5] [6] .
Isolated the gene sequence and suggested biobricks for the coding region (K343001)
Proposed three new biobricks
K343001 - Sandboxed coding sequence from ninaB gene.
K343002 - Sandboxed coding sequence from ninaB gene on one of the weaker Anderson promoters, with rbs and dual terminator.
K343003 - Sandboxed coding sequence for the SopII-HtrII-Tsr fusion protein.

Front End
WebGL
To develop a cross-platform software, we use HTML5 and WebGL for the frontend. We use pixi.js as the framework of our software, and decorate the 2D-Canvas in the html <canvas> for compatibility on browsers which don’t support WebGL.
The aim of this project is to provide a fast lightweight 2D library that works across all devices.
The Pixi renderer allows everyone to enjoy the power of hardware acceleration without prior knowledge of WebGL. It is also very fast.
Unit Test
We use mocha, chai and phantomjs for unit test.
Mocha is a simple, flexible, fun JavaScript test framework for node.js and browsers. For more information please view the documentation.
Chai is a BDD / TDD assertion library for node and browsers that can be delightfully paired with any JavaScript testing framework.
Phantomjs is a headless WebKit scriptable with a JavaScript API. It has fast and native support for various web standards: DOM handling, CSS selector, JSON, Canvas and SVG.
Automated Documentation Generation
We use jsdoc to generate the code documentation and API documentation generator for JavaScript.
Back End
Separation of Front End & Back End
Unlike most websites using MVC architect, we decide to separate front end and back end completely and use REST API as the interface between them. We have made it easier for other biologists and developers to continue work on our basis by decoupling. As a consequence, developers may design their own interface style based on our back end codes and no longer worry about any conflict with present front end codes.
Django & Django REST Framework
Django is a very popular web framework with MVC architect in python, which is efficient, safe and extendable. Based on Django, we also add Django REST Framework and the function of documents generating, thus we can obtain automatically generated API documentation on ustc.software/docs
Cython & Ctypes
In order to further shorten the time of simulating, we use C programming language to rewrite our simulator. Meanwhile we use the techniques of cython and ctypes to connect the simulator with diango framework. As a result, the speed of simulation is approximately 30 times faster"

11.iGEM Alliance
The construction of iGEMUnion was initialized this year with the aim of providing the stage for different groups from all over China to communicate with each other. There were five teams in the iGEMUnion (BIT-China, Tianjin, Jilin_China, CGU and BIT teams), and gradually teams including Peking, NCTU-Formosa and UCAS also participated in the iGEMUnion. We constructed a WeChat group number (iGEM-Union) together and updated our progress and results in it. We also propagandized synthetic biology and iGEM. Through iGEMUnion, all teams are able to communicate their own problems and it is a good stage for teams to collaborate with each other.
12.Youth Education
We always care about the young generation, and we hope our project will have a positive influence on high school students. Therefore, we introduced our project to students at the High School Affiliated to Jilin University. They do not know much about the Synthetic Biology, so we gave a brief introduction about Synthetic Biology and the iGEM competition at the beginning. Then we gave a detailed description about our project. The possibility of using bacteriotherapy to cure cancer was the major topic of our talk, as the major approaches to treat cancer have been radiotherapy, chemotherapy and surgery. We told the students how we designed our genes and how we electrotransfered them into bifidobacteriums. We also explained how our system worked. We also invited them to visit our lab. Not many students showed much interests in our presentation at the beginning of our presentation. However, more and more students showed great interest about our project during our presentation. After we finished our speech, we gave them the e-mail address of our team. Those who are interested in our project could contact our team and get more detailed information about our project and synthetic biology.
12.Youth Education
We think our presentation stimulate their interest in science. We want to introduce more about biological science to those high school students in the future, and we hope some of them will be iGEMers latter!

Susan Chen
Hello! My name is Susan and I am a first year at UCSF in the Tetrad program. I grew up in the east bay area and stayed around to study biochemistry and bioengineering at UC Berkeley (Go Bears!). During my time at Cal, I discovered academic research, more specifically synthetic biology, and became very interested in harvesting the power of biology for useful applications. Spurred by that interest, I joined the 2009 Berkeley iGEM team to work on bacterial surface display, and from there I became inspired to one day TA iGEM, contributing to this rich experience for students and just getting plain old excited for novel synthetic biology research.
Ben Heineike
Ben Heineike is assisting the IGEM team with computational tools.  He is a PhD student in Bioinformatics, and a member of the UCSF center for Systems and Synthetic Biology. He grew up in Kings Beach, Ca and graduated from North Tahoe High School, and afterwards attended the US Naval Academy, where he studied mathematics.  He also holds an MSc in Applied and Computational Mathematics from the University of Oxford.  He spent several years as a Surface Wafare Officer in the US Navy including a tour as a mathematics instructor at the Naval Academy.

I'm Graham, a second year Bioinformatics PhD student here at UCSF.  After doing iGEM as an undergrad at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign... twice, I figured I wasn't quite done yet.  So now I help with the computational aspects of the team's project.  I think iGEM is a pretty cool opportunity. Here at UCSF where we have a team mainly comprised of"
