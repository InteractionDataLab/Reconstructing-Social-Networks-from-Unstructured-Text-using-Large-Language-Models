BioBrick-A-Bot: Sharing and Collaboration in Automated BioBrick Assembly
(New Approach to Human Practice in Synthetic Biology)
Ways to Facilitate Collaboration
BioBrick-A-Bot  is a prototype of a automated BioBrick DNA assembling robot (hereafter called ‘bot’). We have demonstrated with a proof-of-principle that it works. This is only the first step. Once this is done, other iGEM teams can build and customize their own, inexpensive bots. Collaboration is made extremely easy because of the 3 design philosophies below:  replicability, interchangeability and extensibility.
Replicability
The cost of building your own bots is about US $700. The Lego Parts are easily accessible. We will provide hardware construction instructions in a document form, so that iGEM teams can follow and build ALPHA and PHI modules. We will provide RobotC source codes to iGEM teams too.  So, It is easy to replicate BioBrick-A-Bot Model C that we show in the Proof-of-Principle Demo.
Interchangeability
Interchangeability is the next logical step to collaboration and sharing. We have shown a proof-of-principle that it is possible to build two different physical implementations of ALPHA module, with different geometric configuration and physical dimensions, and still run the same software. Hence various other iGEM teams are encourage to customize their own variants of the ALPHA modules. These ALPHA modules should work seamlessly with the software provided. iGEM teams are also encourage to check in new ALPHA implementation in the registry, so as to facilitate sharing and collaborations.
Extensibility
The next phase in collaboration is actually extensibility."
SDU-Denmark,2015,Team:SDU-Denmark#Tour72_-_-_TEXT.html," it means that antibodies mark pathogens, making them more appetizing for phagocytes (i.e. neutrophils and macrophages), agglutinationAgglutinationAgglutinare is Latin and means ""to glue"". In the immune response it means that the antibodies bind multiple antigens, creating a cluster which is easier for the phagocytes to process in one portion instead of one by one. and complement activationComplement SystemWhen the system is activated, several proteases begin to cleave proteins that release certain cytokines, toxic to the pathogen. By a cascade of cleavage reactions the result is the production of a so called cell killing membrane attack complex that will destroy the given microbe. among other reactions.
One example of an effector mechanism could be to attach small gold nanoparticles (sAuNPs). sAuNPs have recently shown to be excellent tools for cancer therapy, especially because of their high biocompatibily, large surface-to-volume ratio and strong diffusivity, which ensure that they remain intact while moving through organisms e.g. Reference: Kim CS, et al. Cellular imaging of endosome entrapped small gold nanoparticles, 2015 Jun 10;2:306-15. doi: 10.1016/j.mex.2015.06.001. [PubMed] By attaching sAuNPs to a peptide aptamer it would be possible to detect and attack pathogenic organisms more precisely, such as cancer cells, instead of using the current method of targeted radioactive therapy where adjacent normal tissue can be seriously damaged too. Reference: Thorek DL et al. Reverse-Contrast Imaging and Targeted Radiation Therapy of Advanced Pancreatic Cancer Models. Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2015 Jun 9. pii: S0360-3016(15)00612-4.

doi: 10.1016/j.semradonc.2015.02.001 [PubMed] If peptide aptamers were to be used as tools in cancer therapy it would be necessary for them to be tolerated by the immune system and show high level of specificity.
One chance of being tolerated by the immune system is by adjusting the size of the protein. The bigger the molecule the larger risk of immunogenicityIm"

The reagents were pipetted in the following order: Water, 10x functionality buffer, fusion protein and adapter. The samples were incubate at 23°C for 1 hour and analysed on 5% native TBE polyacrylamide gel. One of the 8µl fusion protein reaction was treated with heat (90oC) to denature the fusion protein. The resulting gel is either stained with ethidium bromide and imaged with GelDoc system, or directly imaged with Typhoon Imaging System. The resulting gels are shown on figure 1.

Pittsburgh CSL
The Pittsburgh CSL team is the first high school iGEM team from Pittsburgh. The team members represent a variety of backgrounds from the Homewood neighborhood of Pittsburgh. As high school students, they didn’t have much science or biology experience, so during the 2018 iGEM season, we acted as mentors to guide them through this exciting journey of research.
The Pittsburgh iGEM connection with Pittsburgh CSL iGEM began in Fall 2017 when two members from the 2017 Pittsburgh team visited the Citizen Science Lab. The members gave a presentation on the previous year’s research project, played a game they created called the Plasmid Game, and provided insight on what to expect from the competition.
In winter of 2018, one of our current members worked with the CSL team on completing a collaboration with the CMUQ team. The 2017 CMUQ team worked on creating a salt sensor, and the CSL team wanted to further characterize the part Consensus proU-RBS-RFP (BBa_K2467002), an optimized synthetic proU, strong RBS and mRFP1 osmolarity sensor. During the experiments for the characterization, our team member was able to guide the high schoolers through performing transformations, calculating molarities and dilutions, creating stock solutions, and graphing data. After assisting the Pittsburgh CSL team, the CSL team was able to find optimal salt concentration for growth of E. coli.
During the summer, we started by working on the safety form to make sure they knew the basic safety rules in lab, and we asked them to describe their project so that they fully understood the goals and methods. Instead of answering each question on the safety form, we led them to think about the risks and considerations by themselves. It was worthwhile to ask small questions to provide clues to lead to the answers.
Another big part of our mentoring was helping with their Wiki page. Starting the Wiki can be difficult, so we began by going through and talking about each page, letting them know the basic construct and what content should be included. Also, we helped them to create a fundamental template, including clearing the unnecessary code, introducing general style, and creating navigation bar.

Integrated Human Practices Award
We worked closely with experts throughout our project to reach an accurate understanding of endometriosis, as the disease is often misrepresented and much research on endometriosis is incredibly recent. Their expert opinions informed our experimental designs and helped us design a final circuit diagram and potential diagnostic application. More is available on the Integrated Human Practices wiki page.
Basic Parts Collection Award
We created a ""starter kit"" for novice mammalian synthetic biologists including many of the parts we used in our project this year, and a new pDEST using mCherry, a red fluorescent protein that is visible to the naked eye, as a screening tool. This pDEST can be used as an alternative to the patented pDEST ccDb that iGEM HQ cannot distribute. Our parts collection could be distributed to iGEM"

In this way we reduce leaky expression and can start expression at a defined time point.  We used Kanamycin as positive control, Carbenicillin was not suitable because the GyrB expression plasmid encodes a  Carbenicillin resistance. As negative controls we used the respective solvents and pSB1C3-SHV (BBa_K2372004) and pSB1C3-pRha-RBS (BBa_K2372007) which do not express protein.
Figure 2: TC: Tetracyclin (XL1blue are resistant, 250µg)), Kan: Kanamycin (500µg).
Kanamycin always shows a z.o.i. between 4 and 5.5 mm. XL1blue should be resistant to Tetracycline. The z.o.i. might be a result of the small solubility in water resulting in a steep concentration gradient instead of a more homogenous, thus lower concentration.
Figure 3: Carb: Carbenicillin (1000µg), Kan: Kanamycin (500µg), SHV control: BBa_K2372004, pRha-RBS-SHV: BBa_K2372008. 0.1% (w/v) L-rhamnose⋅H2O was used for induction.
The z.o.i. is drastically reduced in XL1blue samples but not that much in the TolC samples. TolC might not be a good expression host.
Figure 4: Clorobiocin (10µg), NDX: nalidixic acid (250µg), Kan: Kanamycin (500µg). 2.5µM of L-arabinose was used for induction.
Nalidixic acid (NDX) is an inhibitor of GyrA, while clorobiocin targets the ATP binding site in GyrB. Therefore NDX can be used as a control. TolC are more sensitive to clorobiocin and NDX than XL1blue. The radius of the z.o.i. in the GyrB expressing samples is reduced in TolC samples.  Because the initially used L-rhamnose concentration seemed too low we used different concentrations to find out the most  suitable.

The peptides from each sample are then tagged with one of four different tags that binds to the free N-terminal present on tryptic peptides. The peptides are then mixed in an equal ratio, securing that the same amount of peptides are present from each sample. The phosphorylated peptides that are especially interesting for the analysis of a kinase, are isolated and purified by a TiO2 purification. Lastly the non-modified peptides and the phosphopeptides are analysed separately by mass spectrometry (Figure 6).
In the mass spectrometer the different iTRAQ tags will fragmentize differently. Therefore while analysing a single spectrum, one can compare the amounts of the proteins from the different samples, simply by comparing the intensity of the reporter ions from the iTRAQ tag. The computer can thus analyse the entire proteome of four bacterial strains at once, identifying interesting differences caused by pantothenate kinase II.
Determination of PHB Production using Flow Cytometry ( Top )
In order to determine the effectiveness of our different PHB producing strains we used nile red staining combined with flow cytometry . Nile red binds to PHB, and as the substance is fluorescent, it can be used as a quantitative measure for the amount of plastic present in a cell Leonardi, R., et al. (2005). ""A pantothenate kinase from Staphylococcus aureus refractory to feedback regulation by coenzyme A."" J Biol Chem 280(5): 3314-3322. . By combining nile red staining with flow cytometry, the average amount of plastic inside every cell from different strains can be compared and thus generate a relative measure ability of the respective strains to produce plastic.

Note about the fluorescence that were are using: Supplementary information from the paper by Ajo-Franklin indicates that the rate constant for RFP maturation is kRFP = 3.1 ± 1.3 x 10-4 s-1 and for YFP is 1.03 ± 0.17 x 10-3 s-1.  These numbers are corrected for photobleaching.
Redoing the PCR
Our gel results indicated that we simply did not run the PCR correctly because we did not even see the positive control on the gel.  Thus, we decided to retry the PCR reactions.  It was noted that we probably used too much template DNA and that 0.1-1 ng/mL is much more realistic.  Thus, we need stock solutions of our plasmid DNA of 0.025 ng/uL.  Since the stock solutions that we currently have are in a concentration of 0.5 ng/uL, we will simply add 5 uL of the latter to 95 uL of Tris HCl.
Also, it should be noted that we did not vortex the primer DNA after suspending it in water.  Thus, we will try to re-make the diluted primer mixes using the remaining water in the ""500uM"" tubes, but only after wortexing thoroughly.  Finally, we will check the program on the thermal cycler to ensure that it is indeed accurate for our purposes.

For our proposed fusions, this is a problem: haloarchaeal gas vesicles ""shrug off"" their surface GvpC if high salt concentrations are not maintained. As a result, we removed this acidic tail that destabilizes the GvpC-gas vesicle binding at low salt concentrations, and used this truncated GvpC for our fusions.

Basic Parts
A basic part is a functional unit of DNA that cannot be subdivided into smaller component parts. BBa_R0051 is an example of a basic part, a promoter regulated by lambda cl.
Most genetically-encoded functions have not yet been converted to BioBrick parts. Thus, there are many opportunities to find new, cool, and important genetically encoded functions, and refine and convert the DNA encoding these functions into BioBrick standard biological parts.
Best Basic Part Special Prize
Most genetically-encoded functions have not yet been converted to BioBrick parts. Thus, there are *many* opportunities to find new, cool, and important genetically encoded functions, and refine and convert the DNA encoding these functions into BioBrick standard biological parts. To be eligible for this award, this part must adhere to Registry sample submission guidelines and have been sent to the Registry of Standard Biological Parts. If you have a part you wish to nominate your team for this special prize , make sure you add your part number to your judging form and delete the box at the top of this page.
Please note: Judges will only look at the first part number you list, so please only enter ONE (1) part number in the judging form for this prize.
Note
This page should list all the basic parts your team has made during your project. You must add all characterization information for your parts on the Registry. You should not put characterization information on this page. Remember judges will only look at the first part in the list for the Best Basic Part award, so put your best part first!"

The debaters address the Speaker of the House and entertain questions, called Points of Information, from debaters arguing the opposite side of the issue. Debaters can stand up to ask a question at any time except the first and last minute of a speech. The speaker may either wave them down or take their question. All speeches are seven minutes. The last speaker on each side summarizes the debate.
First Proposition Speaker:
Competitor at the Debate World Championships 2009
Model: This house proposes that genetic modifcation of all organisms except people be permitted. We would remove all restrictions on what genetic engineering techniques can be used on, but still hold people responsible for the negative consequences of their creations - an 'innocent until proven guilty' plan.
Arguments:
1. Advantages of new strains of organism: for instance, biofuel, nanotechnology components, and golden rice. The more we can control life, the more useful we can make it.
2. Genetic engineering is better than alternative ways of getting new strains: for instance, seeds used to be irradiated to produce new mutations, which is much less controlled than current genetic engineering.
3. The benefits of knowledge
a) pragmatic: to produce tools for the future, and apply that knowledge to learning about other things, such as fighting disease and living longer. We don't need to experiment on people if we can engineer animal models.
b) philosophical: humans are knowledge seeking, that is what separates us from other forms of life. We should take advantage of our unique abilities to pursue knowledge.
First Opposition Speaker
Veteran debater from the Unversity of British Columbia
Second Proposition Speech
Refutation
Re: irraditation to produce new strains: just because previous techniques were bad doesn't mean current techniques are any better
Re: trying to acquire knowledge is important because we don't know the answer - and that's why it's dangerous too. Proposition has agreed experimentation is dangerous.
Arguments
1. Locking stuff up doesn't work: for instance, computer viruses, outbreaks of diseases, illegal transport of weapons. If the floodgates are open, people will experiment with everything. Scientists like to experiment and they won't be careful. Harms of this include ecosystem damage. For instance, CFC's, X-rays, and DDT are substances we should have examined more before using. We are going to make mistakes, so let's not make big ones by doing too much too soon.

We got an article published in the Journal Ingenjören witch is a Journal for engineers all around Sweden and it is posted on their webpage for everyone to read. In the article we talk about the iGEM competition and what kind of project we are working on this year. The article is in Swedish and can be found here: http://www.ingenjoren.se/2015/08/svenska-teknologer-tavlar-i-genteknik/
We have also been published on our university’s webpage under areas of advance, life science engineering. The article contains information about our project and our teams participation in the iGEM competition. The article is in Swedish and can be found here: http://www.chalmers.se/sv/styrkeomraden/livsvetenskaper/nyheter/Sidor/Chalmersstudenter-deltar-i-Genetically-Engineered-Machine.aspx
Last but not least, the scientific Journal Kemivärlden: Biotech who focuses on chemistry and biotechnology have also written an article about us, our project and the iGEM competition. The article will be in Swedish and will be published at the end of September.
We are very happy that we got the opportunity to reach out in all of these different ways and we hope that it results in more people obtaining knowledge about iGEM and this research area. By mainly spreading information to people in the scientific and engineering field we hope to be able to establish and develope more collaborations between iGEM teams and industries. We also wish to make people interested in our project and for them to see the potential in the final product and the possible applications our parts can be used for."

Artist viewpoint
Today, in terms of building unique biological design, synthetic biology has a connection with the arts. Especially in the iGEM project, we compete the most creative design which is based on the E. coli, engineers and artists should build a close relationship. So we had a relationship with Chiaki Ishizuka who belongs to Institute of Advanced Media Arts and Sciences. Thus we made it possible to increase the imagination of the design for the process of biotechnology. And we exchange the opinions and images about ethical issues and safety for synthetic biology critically.

Risk Factor Analysis
SWOT Analysis
Risk Analysis
Risk is an extremely important factor of any venture. The key to mitigating risk is to first understand possible risks before they happen, and develop a comprehensive plan to deal with them. Analyzing key strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats, a SWOT analysis, can also help in determining where issues may arise.
Understanding our Risks
As with any start-up venture, there are a wide variety of risks that we could encounter. The key to managing these risks is to understand the possibility of them occurring and plan carefully as to how we would mitigate each risk should it arise. There are many different types of risks that we could face including legal, financial, technological & operational, market, people and systemic risks.
Legal Risks
For FREDsense Technologies, we foresee that our key risks will be in the legal category, surrounding the regulatory landscape. As our product is designed to meet a growing market need in Alberta surrounding monitoring in the oil sands industry, successful penetration of our market will involve gaining the necessary safety and technology approval for use in mandated monitoring. This poses a significant risk; if we are unable to obtain this regulatory approval, we will need to identify an alternative route to market or potentially encounter difficulties in industry adoption of our technology. Possible reasons for an inability to obtain this approval could be due to lack of capital to do"

modelling and simulation
Replication of E.coli cell
Model written in SBML format is shown below. The dynamic curve of E.coli replication is plotted by time course simulation. Exactly speaking, dynamic behaviors of biological system are meaningless after 4000s because of termination of reproduction of E.coli. However, the curve is in qualitative agreement with that from experiments in the first and second stage of reproduction of E.coli.

Basic example with pLac-LacI repression system
introduction
MoDeL provides poweful supports for description of interactions between two species. No interactions exist in the previous example. In this example, we will construct a plasmid backbone with promoter, rbs, coding sequence and terminator inserted in and transform it into E.coli. LacI repressor are produced after two steps of transcription and translation. It binds with itself to form a dimer and then a tetramer, which could bind with promoter LacI on the plasmid to repress the process of transcription. Besides, replication of E.coli cells, degradation of proteins and mRNAs, as well as dilution due to replication of cells, are also considered.
database construction
Actually, it is a complex molecular process and takes many steps to complete a transcription reaction. It includes binding and initiation, elongation, and termination. So does translation reactions. The first version of MoDeL DOES NOT support transcription and translation reaction templates and they will be handled by our core program of iGame and thus no need to write in the database.
All binding reactions in the database demo are modeled using law of mass action. They are dimerization of two LacI repressors and that of two LacI dimers. LacI tetramers will bind with promoter LacI in the plasmid and thus repressing the expression of plasmid DNAs. However, MoDeL enables any mathematical model form for species-species interactions and is not constrained within only law of mass action. Users could change the reactants, modifiers, products, as well as kinetic laws arbituarily and validate their models via output of dynamic curves.
Species reaction templates are worth mentioning to show features of our new language MoDeL. It is never a easy problem to calculate degradation rates of proteins since different parts in a fused protein may have different degradation rates and the"

Overview Publicity Conference Field Research Questionnaire Provision
Overview
Human practice is the essential part in iGEM competition. We made a good effort to accomplish this part. We grabbed every chance to promote our project, iGEM, and synthetic biology.
We tried a lot to diversify our human practice project. During all activities, we had a great memory and built friendship with other igemers.
Publicity
First, our NTHU_Taiwan held an exhibition at our school library introducing synthetic biology, iGEM competition and our team history and project. It introduced the basic concept of synthetic biology and igem competition.
Next, our team leader Lee Chih-Hsien delivered a talk about synthetic biology and igem in Hsinchuang senior high school. Hope to inspire passion about biology and iGEM in our school and high school student’s heart.
The last one, it’s our honor to be invited to share our experience in iGEM preparation and report innovative projects in one column at Scientific American Taiwanese Edition at January 2017 edition.
Conference
We grabbed every chance to communicate with other teams. We attended three conference during three past months. At National Yang-Ming University we met other seven teams. Next we attended 2016 iGEM Asia Conference with other 19 team experiencing the atmosphere similar to the Giant Jamboree in August.
At September, team HSiTAIWAN and we had a small communication at their school. This year is second time for them to join iGEM. We gained a lot of helpful advice about running a new igem team. We introduced project to the other, sharing the preparing experience during this summer.
At every conference, we met igemers who are also endeavoring for their dreams. Knowing them was really great experience and we become good friends helping each other pursuing our dreams.

It's been fun to be an advisor for the 2010 SDU-Denmark iGEM team. I participated as a student in 2009, and am glad to have been able to help this years team.
When I am not busy working on the iGEM project, I spend time studying medicine, playing with LEGOs and curing cancer.

I'm a PhD student at SDU Department of Physics and Chemistry. I remember from my younger years when I was a master student in biotechnology taht I read about the iGEM competition and wishing to be a part of it. Unfortunately, at that time there was no team at my university. I see now that participating in the iGEM competition as an advisor is just as exciting as being an iGEM student.

Major and Year:
Microbiology and Immunology
Why iGEM:
I joined iGEM this year because I thought it sounded like a lot of fun! I love exploring the unknown, and coming up with wild ideas that might just work. That's what drew me to iGEM, the idea that we really might be able to come up with something crazy and get it to work. That's why I joined iGEM!
Hopes to gain from iGEM:
I was actually hoping to meet a bunch of awesome and nerdy people who shared my interest in molecular and synthetic biology. I'd say that was a success.
What inspires you:
The infinite. People have always talked about limitations. How things can't be done, how they are impossible. I think the impossible, the unobtainable, has always been more of a challenge, something I aspire to. Like a sweet aroma it calls me, always has and always will. One day, I want meet the impossible, the infinite, the endless.
Hobbies:
Well right now I'm learning ballroom dancing! It's actually a ton of fun!!! :D

Honors in Biochemistry (5th Year); Sub-project: Fundraising, Business Development & Team Management
This is my second year being involved in iGEM. While Biochemistry is my major, I have many interests including Genetics, Immunology, Cell Biology, Bioinformatics, and Microbiology. In my spare time I can be found playing sports like soccer, volleyball, or squash, as well as playing piano, listening to music, and playing video games. In the future, I hope to continue into a graduate program in Biochemistry, Cell Biology, or Synthetic Biology. iGEM has been an amazing opportunity to gain additional skills in a variety of fields and I greatly look forward to another year in the competition!

I was born and raised in the city of Edmonton. I plan on continuing on to do my masters at the University of Alberta this following year. I hope to spend my career doing research in the field of immunology or developmental biology. During my free time I rock climb, dance, play Ultimate Frisbee. In the summers I love to camp, hike and spend time at lakes. I also take as many opportunities as I can to travel. This coming fall I will be backpacking around Europe. I joined iGEM because I believe that it will be an interesting experience in a field that I have little experience in and I hope to spend the summer tackling all the difficult problems that come our way.

2. Add then appropriate amounts of 10x Buffer and T4 DNA Ligase. Make sure not to pipette up and down or vortex to mix, this will shear the ligase. Gently swirl with the tip of your pipette to mix.
3. Incubate reaction at room temperature for 30 minutes.
4. After incubation heat inactivate the ligase by another incubation at 80o C for 20 min.
NOTE: The ligase buffer should smell like wet dog. If you smell nothing from the tube, then the buffer is old and useless.
Can also use the Ginkgo Bioworks protocol:
1. Get the 10X T4 DNA ligase buffer and the T4 DNA ligase from the 20 degree storage.
2. Put them on ice to thaw.
3. In a PCR tube add 11 uL of water.
4. Add 2 uL of each digest to the tube.
5. Use a pipet to thoroughly mix the T4 DNA ligase buffer and resuspend the precipitate in the bottom. Then add 2 uL to the PCR tube.
6. Add 1 uL of T4 DNA ligase.
7. Flick the tube to mix it. If necessary, put it in the microcentrifuge to get all the liquid back to the bottom.

Temperature changes
Of the 4 winemakers interviewed, all saw a drastic climate change this last years. Just below,  are the types of changes they have noticed:
Winemaker 1 and 2:“We have seen the impacts of temperatures in the rapid coagulation of vines”.
Winemaker 3 :“There has been a drastic change in temperatures, with significant increases and decreases during different periods of the year. The biggest change has been in the carry-over from all stations, since it seems that seasons have moved on dates and are unpredictable for us”.
Winemaker 4 :“There was a mild raise in summer temperatures, but the winter has become more fierce at certain days, while really mild in the rest”.
In conclusion, in those regions, there is a big impact linked to the climate changements from one season to another that causes each year most of the vines damages.
Some data
The 4 winemakers interviewed claim of losing vines recently due to severe frost or severe drought.                                 One of the UPV_iGEM team affirms that in Utiel-Requena wine fields are absolutely more affected by frost in winter.                                 “La Rioja’s winter are very severe with temperatures under -10°C more or less”- UPV_iGEM team 2017.
Winemaker 1 and 2:“10% to 15% of vines lost due to climate changes in the worst cases”.
Winemaker 3 :“Around 40% of vines lost due to climate changes”.
Winemaker 4 :“He don’t know, with accuracy”.
In conclusion these percentages show a serious problem due to extreme temperatures in the vineyard survival.
Techniques to overcome frost or drought
Of the 4 winemakers interviewed, 3 use specific techniques to fight against severe frost or severe drought and only one doesn’t use any technique.
Winemaker 1 and 2:“Electric heaters, eventually”.
Winemaker 3 :“Prune vines late or early, remove grapes”.
As we can see, most of this techniques are costly and no powerful enough for next years.
Support the use of GMOs to mitigate the impact of climate changes
This question was interesting because, it help us to position SofterShock in their society.                                       In an interesting way, only 1 of 4 winemakers was against using genetically modified vineyards"

Hong_Kong_HKUST,2017,Team:Hong Kong HKUST#HP#Gold Integrated_-_-_TEXT.html," under extreme conditions                             to increase crop yield while having this foreign gene removed before reaching the consumers so                             that these crops will be considered safer in the public’s point of view.
The introduction of GMOs, however, varies between countries in terms of regulation and stringency. In order to explore the                             situation of GMOs and their products in Hong Kong, we had contacted and interviewed with Dr.                             Terence Lau, a biosafety expert from the Hong Kong government. Dr. Lau shared with us about the                             current regulation and control of GMOs. To our surprise, there is yet no measure in preventing                             or mitigating the risks of GMOs being accidentally released in Hong Kong. The government only                             emphasizes on the control of genetically modified organism in some products such as vaccine and                             GM crops where the Centre for food safety had provided guidelines on voluntary labelling of Genetically                             Modified (GM) Food. In addition, industries will take risk to benefit ratios into account before                             considering GMOs as their profit-based business. Throughout this interview, the issue raised                             has inspired us to pursue deeper into the application of Genetic Containment Strategy.

WHAT IS GENETIC CONTAINMENT STRATEGY? HOW IS IT DIFFERENT FROM BIO-CONTAINMENT?
Genetic (Biological) Containment Strategy is a measure to safeguard recombinant DNA in microorganism such that it can only                             be used in lab experiment but not outside. If accidental release happens, growth of modified                             microbes and rDNA replication should be immediately inhibited.
On the other hand, biocontainment is a prevention of risk of genetically engineered microorganism (GEM) release by using                             physical containment.
Hong Kong laboratories mainly relies on biocontainment. But due to the demand for scaling up GEM,                             biocontainment may not be sufficient to contain large scale of GEM. Thus, we propose the use                             of genetic containment strategy as genetic safeguards can potentially prevent the escape of microbes                             from proliferating. 1

THE SENSOR'S POSITIVE FEEDBACK LOOP
Dr. Lau not only shared with us some knowledge regarding biosafety. He also raised questions concerning how we can achieve                             the purpose of knocking out in large population of cells.
We decided on using feedback loop to amplify signals such that sufficient receiver cells can be knocked out at time bound.                             The propagation of AHL signals can be simulated by modeling the rate of diffusion from the senders                             to the receivers and the rate of AHL being amplified again to affect peripheral cells. The positive feedback loop we found involves in the use of luxR cassette in E.coli"

BostonU,2018,Team:BostonU HW#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html,"
This initial chip consists of four inputs, one for the initial sample and the other three are used to dilute that initial sample by adding water. Following each addition of water are mixer so that the liquids are mixed into one homogenous, dilute solution. While the chip works in theory, for this design to work, the initial flow rate of the initial sample is 0.1 or 0.01 mL/hour. This slow rate alongside the larger dimensions of these channels made using this chip unfeasible. And it was redesigned with smaller features.
Version 2
In an attempt to solve the problem of multiplying flow rates faced by the last chip, this version tried to siphoned off three quarters of each dilution through varying resistance. The hope was to mitigate the dramatic increase in flow rates further downstream by only allowing a portion of the flow to continue through the chip, thus allowing faster initial flow rates then those used in the previous chip design. Unfortunately, by creating a path with an intentionally lower resistance, all the flow was redirected to this path instead of just 75% intended to follow this path. This left no fluid to continue through the rest of the chip.
Version 3
This chip is similar in design to that of the original version of this chip with the two primary differences being smaller feature sizes and the addition of more outputs and accompanying valves. The point of smaller feature dimensions is to decrease the wait time, even when using the small flow rates used in the initial chip design. The valves are used for two purposes: testing and timing. This chip was tested with a member of the 2018 BostonU iGEM team using a green fluorescent protein as the initial sample in order to determine the accuracy of each dilution.                 The valves leading to the additional output ports provides
manipulation of the fluid and the ability to collect a sample after each dilution instead of just the third. After testing the system, relying on visual cues to facilitate each dilution, it was determined that the some math modeling needed to be done to determine the timing needed for each mixer to reach a steady state before collecting each of the three outputs.

Cell Sorting
After NEGEM, we started a brief collaboration with the MIT iGEM team. As part of their project, they were looking for a way to culture two different types of cells in the same environment under a continuous influx of media. The outputted media would then be analyzed to see if the inhibitor molecules they were looking to produced had been secreted"

TEAM SPIRIT!
Our team consist of thirteen bright undergrads, working eagerly for nine months, transforming our project design into reality. With the kind help from our advisors and instructors, we managed to make the most out of our time. We learned, grew and bonded over the (most of the times) stressful hours of digestion, gel electrophoresis, PCR and ligation. These are the people whom we celebrated with when we found out the digestion release bands with right length. These are also the people who patted us in the back when we saw no GFP expression under the fluorescence microscope. We wanted YOU to know them and us better. Don't be afraid to say HI if you see us in the Regional Jamboree. Who knew, maybe we could end up doing research together in the future!

We also designed several questions on antibiotic residues, which is directly linked to our project. People tend to believe that antibiotic residues widely exist in nature. 55% of them believe that antibiotic residues can be found in sediments, and this proportion is the lowest among those chose surface/underground water and farm lands. In stark contrast, people overlook antibiotics found in their daily lives. Most of them (at least 67%) know that antibiotics can be detected in meats (poultries, fish and cattle), but only 30% said they know antibiotics occur in drinking water, with merely 24% chose honey.
At last, we asked people about security problems in our project. When questioned whether it is acceptable to use genetically modified organisms(GMOs) in waste water treatment plants(WWTPs) or hospitals to degrade antibiotics, only 11% of people found it unacceptable, with 9% strongly reject the use of any GMO outside laboratory. Most of them (72%) think it is acceptable as long as there are certain security measures. That is also why we designed a double-function safe lock, preventing horizontal-gene-transfer and bacteria escape at the same time (see our Design part).
What is more, we also observed that biological majors did not outperform non-biological majors on antibiotic residues. This indicates that even professionals know little about the scale and harm of antibiotic residues.
With Industrial Representatives
China, as the world’s biggest and the most fast-growing economy, is also catching up in scientific research. At an event, called Synthetic Biology: China Innovation for Global Bioeconomy, held at Penn Wharton China Center, Prof. James Schroeder lectured on how China as a rapidly developing synthetic biology market could lead rather than follow in some synthetic biology products and services (Fig. 4). Mr. Schroeder is a Penn Alumni and is the only patent attorney on the industrial advisory board of SynBERC (the Synthetic Biology Engineering Research Center), a major U.S. research program to make biology easier to engineer.

From Mr. Schroeder’s speech, we learned how synthetic biology could be applied to produce real products that are closely connected to environment protection, manufacture green material and so on.
Particularly, Mr. Schroeder also talked about how the iGEM competition has contributed to the development of synthetic biology and its industrialization. After the speech, we also talked with some investors from"

iGEM teams are unique and leading the field because they ""go beyond the lab"" to imagine their projects in a social/environmental context, to better understand issues that might influence the design and use of their technologies.
Teams work with students and advisors from the humanities and social sciences to explore topics concerning ethical, legal, social, economic, safety or security issues related to their work. Consideration of these Human Practices is crucial for building safe and sustainable projects that serve the public interest.

INTRODUCTION
Progress happens when data collected overtime accumulates and gives birth to new data or a product. However, to accumulate the data, variability in previous datas should be reduced to a minimum so that it can be declared that everyone reach the same results with same protocols and labs are able to reliably build upon others’ work.
As the one of the biggest interlaboratory studies, the goal of the iGEM InterLab study is to identify and correct the sources of systematic variability in synthetic biology measurements and has been successfully doing so for the past 4 years.
This year, the ınterlab studies aim to tackle the variability issues in fluorescence measurements. There are two given options to solve this problem normalizing to absolute cell count or  normalizing the colony-forming units (CFUs) instead of OD.
Results and Observation
Table.1  A table of ludox results which have been used as reference.
Ludox
LUDOX CL-X was used as a reference to transform the absorbance data into a OD 600 value.
Particle Standard Curve
A suspension made with silica microsphere, which have similar optical properties with the cells used, was used to construct the particle standard curve.
Theoretically, as they have similar optical properties, the values obtained from this dilution series of the silica microspheres should be approximately the same as the values that should be obtained from cells. Thus the results were used to estimate the numbers of cells in certain absorbances.
This experiment was done according to the iGEM InterLab Plate Reader Protocol.

Fluorescein Experiment
Plate readers give out fluorescence values in arbitrary units that vary from one instrument to other. Therefore absolute fluorescence values cannot be directly compared from one instrument to another. This experiment was done in order to compare fluorescence output of test devices between teams.

UAM_Poznan,2016,Team:UAM Poznan#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," one composed of the most common codons (sfGFP-B, the best choice) in E. coli orfeome and another codon-monotonous as well but composed of the rarest ones (sfGFP-W, the worst case). According to bioinformatics analysis we indicated 7 codons that occur in E.coli genome with the least frequency rate. They encode Arginine (AGG), Leucine (CTA), Isoleucine (ATA), Glycine (GGA), Serine (TCA), Proline (CCC) and Threonine (ACA). These codons represent 40% of all codons of sfGFP_Worst ORF. sfGFP_B and sfGFP_W constructs differ within all codons with the exception of the first ten residues that correspond to a stable N-end as a 6-histidine tag, which is often used for affinity purification of recombinant proteins.
Looking for any other general way to optimize ORFs, we are working now on contrasting ORFs, which are AT or GC rich, with codons optimization based on codon adaptation index. Further experiments concern examining codon context effect, a hypothesis claiming that the translational efficiency of a given codon depends highly on its neighboring codons. Therefore, using specially designed software designed by our advisor, Melania. She analyzed and chose codon pairs which occur most often and least often in E.coli transcriptome. We have prepared four different codon context rankings: one based on whole orfeome and three different sets of coding sequences for high abundant proteins. Using the rankings we have maximized and minimized codon context for two ORFs, sfGFP and mRFP to test if there is a correlation between single codon, codon pair frequencies and protein abundancy.
Biobricks’ improvements
According to the criteria that each group has to fulfill in order to get gold medal, we improved function of two biobricks, which we delivered to the iGEM Registry in 2015: one arabinose induced promoter- Arashort1 (araBAD; BBa_K1741000 ), and one xylose induced promoter- XylS (xylA-proD5'UTR; BBa_K1741009 ).
These year’s improved constructs are as follows:
BBa_K2014003 - pBAD-M5'UTR->sfGFP – improvement of pBAD promoter (BBa_K1741000) with M5’UTR,
BBa_K2014004 - pxylS-M5'UTR->"
NRP-UEA-Norwich,2012,Team:NRP-UEA-Norwich#NOSensing_-_-_TEXT.html," lag phase only study needed to be carried out to see if there was a significant difference in the lag phase.  Again the study protocol was the same except that the starting concentration absorbances at 600nm was lowered to <0.04. It was extremely difficult to keep the absorbances ranges within 0.005 so the range is actually 0.3±0.1.
Figure 7A mean average of all the data; using the data from the calibration curve, the absorbances were converted to colony forming units per ml (CFU/ml). The trend lines of alpha cells, BM/MB and PyeaR transformed cells are shown within this order from highest to lowest trendlines. One single trendline was used to represent BM and MB because the actual trendlines were extremely similar.
Using the initial concentrations of 0.3±0.1 showed that there is little difference between the growth rates. Using statistical analysis, it was found that there was no significant difference between any of the transformed cells relative to Alpha cells or to each other (Anova, p > 0.05). From this study we have found that changes in growth occur during exponential growth phase and not the lag growth phase.
Generation of B-M and M-B with eCFP and RFP
In order to test the activity of the hybrid promoters a reporter needed to be ligated. As the hybrid promoter did not already contain a ribosome binding site (RBS) both the RBS and the reporter were needed to be ligated to the promoter; in order to help improve experimental efficiency the parts registry was searched for relevant reporters that also contained an RBS. In week three two reporters were identified as BBa_E0420 , a BioBrick for enhanced CFP (eCFP) + RBS + terminators, and BBa_K081014 , a BioBrick for RFP + RBS + terminators.
Once the B-M and M-B BioBricks had been created in week six work began in earnest on the fluorescent proteins and ligating the promoters to them in order to begin characterisation. Due to many set-backs with low levels of DNA and having to order more BioBricks from the registry, a successful ligation of the promoter to a fluorescent protein reporter was finally achieved in week ten . In order to carry out the ligation the promoter was first digested using Spe1 and Pst1 in order to linearise the backbone downstream of the promoter; the fluorescent proteins were digested using Xba1 and Pst1 in order to remove the insert. A ligation was then carried out"

Standardized Datasheets
Creating a Better Way to Communicate Data
Overview
Synthetic biology is a rapidly growing field of science that promises to revolutionize almost every part of our technology. However, one of the biggest drawbacks of synthetic biology compared to other fields is the lack of standardization within the field. Some of this can be attributed to the nature of the field itself; biological systems are much harder to control than electrical or mechanical ones.
A good portion of the problem though, comes from how the genetic parts are characterized and presented. The iGEM competition has sought for many years to create a “Registry of Standardized Parts” so that iGEM teams and other researchers can submit and use genetic parts that have been proven to work and function. While creating and characterizing new parts and devices to be added to the registry are important, if the information needed to use that part is not communicated efficiently, the parts themselves are useless. This year, the Purdue iGEM team set out to solve this problem by creating a definitive characterization standard for the registry. By talking and collaborating with over fifty other iGEM teams around the world, we have developed a way to standardize how characterization data is submitted and presented in the registry.
This system encompasses an easy, template-based system to enter data of a part into the iGEM registry. Once implemented, our solution will revolutionize the Registry of Standardized Parts and add some much-needed standardization to the field of synthetic biology.
Background
As everyone in iGEM already knows, using the Registry of Standardized Parts can be a very frustrating endeavor. Searching through the registry with ease takes practice, and even then it can be difficult to find good parts to use. Many of the parts in the registry have little to no characterization data present on their registry pages. And some parts in the registry have been very"

Background
In order to fulfill the requirements of testing diseases at home for patients instead of going to                         hospital tested by high-tech testing equipment. We designed our products which can upload                         grayscale data to the cloud and analyze it through mobile devices obviously. What we required is                         just a liquid crystal detection scheme, which is sufficient to reflect the change in                         β2-MG                         concentration.
The main purpose of our experiment is to prove whether the change in β2-MG                         concentration in the                         home test box (Dr. Familict) can be reflected in the liquid crystal through a noticeable gray                         scale change. Therefore, we have constructed a molecule that is more suitable for the liquid                         crystal detection system based on the nano-antibody, a competitive combination which can disturb                         the liquid crystal to change the gray level of the image.
We designed a competitive binding method : First, immobilizing a certain amount of β2-MG                         in a                         liquid crystal, and then combining the test solution with an excess of Nanobody. The mixture is                         then added to the liquid crystal, and due to the excess of the Nanobody, the excess is bound to                         the immobilized β2-MG, causing perturbation of the liquid crystal. Since the fixed                         β2-MG is a                         certain amount, the amount of β2-MG in the liquid to be tested can be calculated by                         the                         difference method. However, during the experiment, we found that the nano-antibody itself has                         little disturbance to the liquid crystal, so we hope to construct a more interfering molecule                         based on the nano-antibody. At the same time, we tested the effects of different β2-MG                         and                         nanobody concentrations on liquid crystal perturbations, and hope to find a set of solutions                         with the most obvious gray scale changes.
Experiment
Our experiments are mainly divided into two parts: molecular biology experiments and liquid                         crystal experiments.
We obtained nano-antibodies with aldehyde groups by adding aldehyde-based labels to                         nano-antibodies and by FGE treatment. After that, we added C18 to the Nanobody to enhance its                         interference. Finally, we verified that the interference of the antigen concentration on the                         liquid crystal can be detected.
In the molecular biology sector, we planned to connect a long-chain molecule (C18) on the                         nanobody in order to increase the interference of nano-antibodies on liquid crystals.
Firstly, We constructed two plasmids, p"

METAL BINDING PROTEIN
The use of the CutA protein is employed as a proof of concept because it is found in E. coli and binds to copper. This protein ensures that ion homeostasis is preserved within the cell, whereby the excess of copper ions is removed by this protein[5]. There will also be a hexahistidine tag for purification purposes. The CutA protein has three binding sites allowing for three copper ions to be bound per protein.
Our primary proof of concept proteins to be used are CutA and Cup1. Both are copper binding proteins to be used in the final construct attached to the ELP N- or C-terminal in order to effectively bind to ions. For protein purification, a hexahistidine tag will be used in the constructs for either protein.
In further applications of our project, there are many different proteins that can be used in our final system for the tailings ponds that are able to bind various metal ions. By using the CutA as well as Cup1 proteins as a proof of concept, this shows that our system is able to work properly with a metal binding protein.

Calgary,2013,Team:Calgary#Project#OurSensor#Linker_-_-_TEXT.html,". We built a GFP with an E coil ( BBa_K1189014 ) and we also built TALE-B with a K coil ( BBa_K1189030 ). To characterize the binding of the coils we pulled down with either an immunoglobulin G antibody (IgG) that serves as a negative control or with GFP antibody. The idea behind this experiment is to pull down the E coil which is fused to GFP with a GFP antibody and then probe with a anti-his antibody which recognizes the his tag on the TALE fused to the K coil. Upon interaction between the E and K coils we will see an output at approximately 86 kDa when probed with a His-antibody as seen in Figure 7. Our test groups included the coils by themselves and both the E and K coils put together in solution. As seen in Figure 7 a band appears only when we pull E and K coil with a GFP and probe with an anti-his antibody indicating the presence of both GFP and TALE in the elution solution indicating that the coils interact with each other.
Figure 7. Immunoprecipitation assay showing that the E and K coils interact with each other. The first three lanes show E coil, K coil and E coil with K coil pulled down with IgG (control) antibody. The last three lanes were pulled down with a anti-GFP antibody and probed with a anti-his antibody. The E coil is fused to GFP BBa_K1189014 and the K coil is fused to TALE with a his tag BBa_K1189030 . Therefore, if we pull down with GFP and probe with his-antibody a band would appear the size of TALE. This indicates that both the GFP and the TALE are present and that is possible upon coil-coil interaction.
Ferritin Scaffold

The ferritin scaffold we chose to use, BBa_K1189018 , allows us to modulate our system as we wish. We determined the ferritin-coiled-coil system could be used for more than the detection of our E.coli sequence. The ferritin scaffold can detect other sequences of DNA by exploiting the ability of the TALE system to be easily engineered and modified, along with the interchangeability of the coiled-coil system. Thus by attaching K coils to TALEs that"

Experimental Data
Firstly, we wanted to show that we could get the bacteria inside of the beads. To do this we created beads that contained fluorescent bacteria. The bacteria we used were from the interlab study: 20K MG, 20K ∆F, and 20K DH5, with MG(-) as a negative control.
We made sets of the beads for 5 days while measuring the fluorescence using the GFP protocol on the FLUOstar Omega plate reader.
The data shows that the wells that contain beads made with encapsulated fluorescent bacteria have a much higher fluorescence than the beads made without any bacteria and the beads made with the negative control bacteria. Therefore, we concluded that the bacteria are encapsulated inside of the beads.
We then made beads using Crystal Violet dye in order to record the diffusion of the dye out of the bead. The data could then be related to the diffusion of the protein via dimensional analysis for our modelling.
We collected the following spectrophotometric absorption data which we calibrated to prepared concentration standards.
(Further analysis of this can found in our modeling section.)
Next we tried to determine whether the bacteria were alive inside the beads and could therefore grow and continue to secrete our proteins.
To do this we made up beads containing the 4 different types of bacteria and placed these bacteria into wells of a 96-well plate containing M9 media. We measured the fluorescence of each well every 15 minutes over 20 hours at 37˚C.
This experiment produced very promising data that suggests the bacteria are growing inside the beads and producing GFP. Therefore we can assume that our bacteria would be able to grow and produce our anti-biofilm agents while encapsulated. The graph shows that the fluorescence of the 3 beads containing the fluorescent bacteria increased over time, and that the bead containing no bacteria remain constantly low. The bead containing our negative control had a very slight increase in fluorescence over time but much less than the bacteria containing the gene for GFP. This could be due to some contamination during the process of making the beads.
We put some consideration into the storage of our beads as hospitals would need to have a supply of them in order to carry out treatment effectively without having to make the beads and use them in a specific amount of time. This would cause delay in treatment and also a lot of waste of materials"

Introduction
Filamentous fungi are only rarely used in iGEM. This is partly because genetic modifications take a lot more time, but also because there are few (if any) parts available in the iGEM registry. Fortunately, we found that the 2013 Cornell team has selected a fungus as organism of choice. They are working on Basidiomycetes and are making a toolkit for this chassis that has not been used in iGEM before. We decided that, since Cornell is making selection markers for filamentous fungi, we would use their constructs and validate them in our organism of choice: Aspergillus niger. These constructs encoded antibiotic resistance cassettes against hygromycin and geneticin. In addition a pki promoter was send to the iGEM team of Cornell.
Aim
The goal was to test the geneticin resistance gene in A. niger. Cornell was kind enough to provide us with pure geneticin to perform the experiment. As hygromycin could not be sent via standard shipping as it is considered a hazardous material, we only worked with the geneticin resistance construct.
Approach
The construct we received from the iGEM team from Cornell University was present in E. coli and the organization of the construct was as followed: promoter, the geneticin resistence gene and a terminator. The first step was to isolate the plasmid from E. coli, and after obtaining sufficient quantities of the vector it was used to transform A. niger. The transformants were grown on two different concentrations of geneticin and one controle plate for a period of 3-4 days at 30°C. One plate contained a control and no geneticin was present in the agar"

Applied Design
The Sensynova Biosensor Development Platform provides an elegant solution to various problems with current biosensor development and deployment, with these issues being the reasons behind the underuse of synthetic biology biosensors
Figure 1: Multicellular Sensynova system.
Summary
We have designed a modular, multicellular biosensor development platform
We have looked at the problem of lack of synthetic biology biosensors used in everyday life
We have evaluated the problems with whole cell biosensors e.g. such as lack of reusability, and addressed these problems with our design e.g. the ability to switch in-switch out different parts without further engineering
The integration of this platform into current development and possible disruption
The benefits of the lifecycle of this product for our lives and the environment
How the design of Sensynova solved a real-world problem
Synthetic biology biosensors have many advantages over their alternatives (e.g. mass spectrometery machines) such as the low level of equipment required for sensing, as well as their portability in the field. However, their potential is not being fully exploited for many reasons investigated in our human practices.
At the beginning of the design process of a product to aid biosensor development, we researched how biosensors are currently developed. We found that parts were rarely reused between designs, since biosensor components are typically tightly coupled in a single cell type. It was also found that a great deal of effort was required to optimise biosensors and tune their characteristics. We wanted to develop a more convenient, modular approach to facilitate reuse and ease the optimisation process.

To control the motion of C.crescentus, we firstly constructed the basic circuits, then we built a agent-based modeling with visualization in. What's more, we also started a new web-based modeling framework.
Gene Circuits
We've constructed several modeling skeleton in Matlab Simbiology Package, they are:
DgrA/DgrB Circuit in regulating the flagellum movement
HfiA/HfsJ Circuit in regulating the genesis of composing substances holdfast.
DgrA/DgrB Circuit
You can get some basic information from the project part , we will get a brief illustration.
After some analysis, we constructed a rudimentary gene.
Equations
$\frac{d([cdiGMP-DgrA])}{dt} = \frac{(Ka \cdot [cdiGMP] \cdot DgrA - Kf \cdot [cdiGMP-DgrA] \cdot FliL - [Kd_{cdiGMP-DgrA}] \cdot [cdiGMP-DgrA])}{cell}$
$\frac{d([cdiGMP-DgrB])}{dt} = \frac{(Kb \cdot [cdiGMP] \cdot DgrB - [Kd_{cdiGMP-DgrB}] \cdot [cdiGMP-DgrB])}{cell}$
$\frac{d(FliL)}{dt} = \frac{(-Kf \cdot [cdiGMP-DgrA] \cdot FliL + Kg_{FliL})}{cell}$
$\frac{d([cdiGMP-DgrA-FliL])}{dt} = \frac{(Kf \cdot [cdiGMP-DgrA] \cdot FliL)}{cell}$
Results
The fellowing pictures simulated the change of [FliL] and [cdiGMP-DgrB] with time.
We can read that with upstream signals, the concentration of protein related to the flagellum functions does change.

Environmental Concerns
Our Project and the Enviromnent
One of the primary concerns of health and environmental organizations is the contamination of fresh water with dangerous toxins including naphthalene and arsenic as a direct by-product of bitumen extraction. Water used in the process of extracting bitumen and the waste sand, solvents, and other leftovers, collectively known as “tailings”, are stored and left to settle in tailings ponds adjacent to mining operations. Water from these ponds is recycled back, causing greater accumulation of arsenic and naphthalene which  are naturally drawn into the water during bitumen processing.
To prevent seepage into the groundwater, the tailings ponds contain groundwater monitoring facilities and containment dykes to recapture and recycle seepage. Unfortunately, these preventative measures are not failsafe. For instance, under escalating pressure from the people and government, the oil sands industry recently launched a new Lower Athabasca Water Quality Monitoring Program in 2011, increasing the frequency of water quality measurements to better assess the effect of oil sands activities.
Clearly, the risk of Canadian watershed contamination remains a pressing issue, and there exists an urgent demand for efficient detection methods of pollutants from tailings ponds.
This year, the Cornell iGEM team strives to meet that growing need.

Note that two measurements were taken for each sample, which accounts for the two values seen for each colony.
Combined all three overnight cultures with 100 mL of fresh media.  This yielded a titer of approximately 4.74E6 cells per mL, which is just under the recommended titer of 5E6 cells per mL.  Note that 115 mL should make more than 20 transformations.
Put into shaking incubator at 11:20 am.  Took out around 3:50 pm, about 4.5 hours of incubation time.
Second set of ODs, from the large culture, were as follows:
0.137
0.208
Spun down two tubes of 45 mL of the culture.  Resuspended each one in 1 mL.  The approximate volume after resuspending was 1.2 mL.  Applied 100 uL to each of the transformations.  This corresponds to about 6.47E7 cells per transformation.
There were only 11 plates available.  As such, it was necessary to hold off on plating the pRS305 + pRS306 part.  This was placed in the fridge for plating tomorrow.  However, for the plates that were made, half the plate contained 50 uL of the original transformation mixture while the other half contained 50 uL of a 1:100 dilution of the same mixture.  This was done in an attempt to glean some information about the transformation efficiency, as well as to hopefully attain sufficiently isolated colonies.  However"

However, we substituted oleic acid with peanut oil, which contains about 50% oleic acid and is much cheaper. Peanut oil was also used in a different synthetic feces recipe developed by NASA [23]. We prepared synthetic poop supernatant samples with 0.05 mM, 0.5 mM and 2 mM concentrations of 1:1:1 solution of acetic acid, butyric acid and propionic acid assuming no VFA were present in the samples initially. Although the HPLC working range for VFA quantification is 0.1 - 1 mM, we wanted to test concentrations above and below the limit as we are unsure of VFA concentrations we should expect from our fermentation experiments. Lastly, we also prepared a supernatant sample without added VFA. We then ran these samples on the HPLC.
While running HPLC samples in Dr. Strous’ lab, we also spoke with Karen, who is working on producing PHB from algae. Karen can provide us with samples of their PHB. They produce approximately 2 mg of PHB from 25 mg of dry weight, obtained from 15 mL of harvest and have approximately 700 mL of harvest per day.
NN-Labs, that we contacted last week, can make PHB granules in 20 - 60 nm range, but we may face issues with getting the PHB granules out of the aqueous suspension. We contacted Dr. Nashaat Nassar, Dr. Maen Husein, & Dr. Giovanniantonio Natale about re-suspension and dispersion of nanoparticles. Dr. Natale recommended literature search on chemical functionalization (Sperling & Parak, 2010).
Week 10: July 3-7
The results of the first HPLC run to quantify VFA were inconclusive due to background noise (which made peak integration challenging) and issues with the standard curve (which most likely occurred due to a dilution mistake during preparation). We identified peanut oil as a potential source of the background noise; for the second run, we will not add oil when preparing synthetic feces and will dilute samples with milliQ water.
This week, we also broke down the process we would need to develop for Mars into multiple stages: collection and fermentation of solid human waste to obtain VFA, separation of VFA from fermented human waste, fermentation of genetically engineered bacteria with obtained VFA to produce PHB"

Prof. Juliana Chan
Prof. Albert Yu
Overview
Professor Albert Yu is the chairman of the Hong Kong Biotechnology Organization (HKBIO), and also a professor of the Department of Neurobiology of Peking University, China. As an entrepreneur and a scientist, Prof. Yu gave us realistic insights to our project. Meeting Prof. Yu helped us to evaluate our project beyond the laboratory environment and to think about its possible future application as a biotechnology product. Towards the end of the interview, we also talked about the bioethics and biosafety issues regarding synthetic biology.
Main Discussion
Prof. Yu mentioned that our project is a small step and that we have a long way to go to apply our project as a commercial biotechnology product. He told us that because we are trying to insert genes into a human body, we need to be very careful with concluding how our project could be realistically applied in the future. Inserting genes into a human body can create novel metabolism properties that could lead to side effects. Also, because the general public considers obesity less harmful, people might be reluctant to sign up for invasive treatment if they believe a less invasive means such as exercising can solve the problem. He also encouraged us to look into other plant genes that could be used to cure fatal diseases.
We also discussed about issues on biosafety and bioethics. Prof. Yu said that we need to be responsible scientists and utilize research to improve human life. He also mentioned that to produce a bioproduct, it is very important to consider the ethical issues of the project from the very start.
Conclusion
The interview with Professor Albert Yu helped us to realize the social environment our project would encounter, and the barriers that come with it. The interview also showed that more in-depth consideration of our project’s future application is necessary if we want to see it utilized as a safe bioproduct.

We also PCR screened the multiple set SDMs that we did on the J23101 + B0034 + Reductase + B0034 + Dehydrogenase and the K206000 version of the construct. There were no bands at all and the plates looked strange because of the different morphologies of the colonies. We are also sending some things off for sequencing -- the J23101 + B0034 + Reductase + B0034 + Dehydrogenase to check for the aerobic mutations.
Thursday September 6th
We took the OD reading of the Strain E-15 EG3 and MG1655 and halted the culture at OD 0.2. The cells were taken to Arcadia for mutagenesis (EMS) and grown in LB overnight. A PCR screen was done for B0034+ Reductase+ B15 (aerobic), which showed successful band sizes and liquid cultured overnight. A gel was also run for the SOEing PCR, resulting in only several visible bands. The SOEing fragments were gel extracted but not ligated together because there were no complementary pieces. A new multiple set SDM was set up for J23101 + B0034 + Reductase + B0034 + Dehydrogenase, K206000 + B0034 + Reductase + B0034 + Dehydrogenase, and B0034 + Reductase + B0015 using a longer elongation time (10 minutes) and was transformed. Gibson PCR screen results had sizes expected. Gibson reaction itself was run afterward. Second Gibson PCR run using lower concentrations. Gibson reaction results showed no combination of pieces, unsuccessful. PCR screen on B0034+KAN+B0015+J23101 run and liquid cultures taken from successful screens.
Friday September 7th
We are trying the SOEing reactions again, in hopes that we get more bands. We went back to our stocks to make primer dilutions so that everything was at 10 uM, and again, we used 50 ng of template DNA. We had to re-transform the multiple set SDM reactions that we had from yesterday because they were accidentally vortexed and destroyed the competent cells. From yesterday, we are taking the mutants that grew overnight and plated 200 and 400 uL on ethylene glycol plates. We got our sequencing data back for the J23101 + B0034 + Reductase + B0034 + Dehydrogenase for the aerobic mutations. Min"

In a way the methods of surviving on Mars are similar to the methods of cultivation practices by stone age humans. We use the technology available to us to help us survive in new environments and stay for longer periods of time. Whereas we once used selective breeding to select for desirable traits we now use molecular Biology to insert desirable genes into target organisms so that we may survive in a more hostile environment.
Conclusion
The overall question in this report has been ""why colonize Mars?"". In three parts, we have tried to cover the question from different angles in order to give an informed answer.
In part 1, it was made clear that similar events have happened historically and that a general motivating factor for both the space race and imperialism has been to demonstrate political power. Another important conclusion to be drawn from is that attention and support from the public has a big effect in what decisions get made on behalf of a country. As seen previously during the space race, once the attention of the public drops, so does the government's funding and consequently the development within that field.
In part 2 we conclude, that there are some major problems on earth at this point that many people will likely find more urgent than colonizing another planet. However as technology moves closer and hopefully some of the important problems on earth will be solved, it is likely that the question of colonising Mars will gain more interest and more people will get involved in the discussion.
In part 3 we discuss whether colonizing Mars requires taking a significant risk in terms of contaminating the planet. We find that the risk is rather small due to extensive sterilization procedures and that it is considered unlikely that any bacteria coming from humans would be able to survive in a martian environment and thereby contaminate Mars. However there is a risk and that risk is important to take into consideration when deciding whether or not to colonize Mars.
Perspective
During this report we've approached the overall question of space colonization - specifically in relation to Mars. Will we colonize, why will we colonize, and how will we colonize? This was done as an attempt of exploring the relevance of our universities' contributions to the annual iGem competition which are all space-related and should be used in the context of space travel. The project by the Technical University of Denmark deals with mycotecture in space by making a building material of mycelium which has been modified to suit extreme"

Goettingen,2012,Team:Goettingen#NeuTest3_-_-_TEXT.html," for their own projects.
The iGEM competition started in 2003 as a course for students of the MIT only. 2011, already 165 universities from all over the world competed against each other. This year, it is the first participation of the University of Göttingen, Germany. The iGEM competition is a great opportunity for students to gain and improve a multitude of skills that are necessary during a carrier as a molecular biologist. Such skills would be planning and organizing a project, including fund raising and team recruitment, coordination of lab work, designing experiments and working together as a team. Next to intensive lab work during the summer, also literature search and well-structured documentation of the experiments is crucial. Moreover, safety for humans and environment is key.
Homing Coli
Escherichia coli is a commonly used bacterial model organism. It has lots of beneficial traits, e.g. a short generation time and it can be easily manipulated. Most E. coli strains that are used in laboratories do not exhibit high motility. The crucial element for motility is the flagellum, which is rotated by a molecular motor within the cell wall. Consequently, these are reduced in cultivated E. coli strains.
Our goal is to create an E. coli strain with increased swimming motility on special  agar plates. Therefore, we will overexpress regulators and parts of the E. coli flagellum in cultivated strains in order to enhance bacterial swimming ability. The fastest E. coli strains will be selected and  further improved. At the same time we will then be able to create an effective motility-selection   method.
Now, you are probably wondering what the advantage of a fast E. coli might be. The beneficial fast phenotype can be combined with the ability of this bacterium to sense specific compounds in their environments. Chemoreceptors enable it to move towards or along gradients of such substances. We will use PCR-based site directed mutagenesis on the E. coli TAR receptor. The combination of speed and chemotaxis allows us to identify E. coli strains, which can sense interesting compounds. Thereby, an easy method for the detection of pollutants, toxins or even tumors could be provided.

Stockholm,2016,Team:Stockholm#Health_-_-_TEXT.html," agents is very dim. The pipe-line is dry, as they say. The cost of production of antibiotics is extremely high and very few pharmaceutical companies are willing to take on the task. We are left with previously abandoned drugs like colistin, because of it's toxicity, to treat many MDR infections. Even then, recent reports have emerged describing plasmid-mediated colistin resistance in Escherichia coli. This is not good news as the prospect of colistin resistance spreading among the Enterobacteriaceae will be dangerous. It means you are going to have more pan-resistant organisms causing infections in the future and more and more patients will die as a result. So we need new antibiotics to help the few that we have right now.
Question: Your studies in the microbiology of diabetic foot ulcers were intriguing; the fact that you found the commonest agents isolated were Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus is of particular interest in our project. We have aimed to target the most common strain of bacteria that is found in chronic wounds, and although our main focus has been staphylococcal biofilms, can you tell us more about the Gram-negative bacterial composition of the chronic wounds that you studied.
Answer: I am not a diabetologist. I just wandered into the infections that are common in diabetic patients. We know that diabetic patients are usually more vulnerable to infections than a normal person because of deranged defense systems. One of the problems that they usually have is a wound that would not heal. Such wounds (ulcers) occur more in the foot. The ulcer then becomes secondarily infected. In the first week of an infected ulcer, S. aureus is the commonest and earliest organism involved. Then Pseudomonas spp. comes in. Gram-positive and Gram-negative anaerobes like Peptostreptococcus spp and Bacteroides spp., respectively come in later to complicate the milieu of bacterial flora present in the ulcer.
Question: Current treatments rely heavily on antibiotics and debridement of the wound biofilm which have proven to be minimally effective and contribute to widespread antibiotic resistance. We have worked on the development of a spider-silk based wound healing technology; we will conjugate the antimicrobial proteins to the silk, aiming to degrade the bacterial biofilm matrix of chronic wounds. How can we adapt this wound dressing to target both Gram-negative organisms and the anaerobes that you have studied.
Answer: I believe that any material that can disrupt biofilm would be very useful in the management of infections caused by"
