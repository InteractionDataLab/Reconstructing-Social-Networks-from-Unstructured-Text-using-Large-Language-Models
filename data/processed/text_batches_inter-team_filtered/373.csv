3. Optimization of Aptamer Assay Condition
We were able to monitor the change in fluorescence signal and the time required for signal development using real-time PCR system. N9-694 and N2-545 probes were used.
It was shown that our aptamer-probe pairs generally require only 10 minutes of cooling to give out a detectable signal, which is around 75 degrees Celsius. (Fig 3.1)
Fig.3.1 Time and Temperature for signal development of N9 and N2 probes. Fluorescence intensity is measured in Bio-Rad Real-Time PCR system. Reaction mixtures are heated at 95 degrees Celsius for 5 minutes, then slowly dropped to 25 degrees Celsius. N=1.
On the other hand, after refolding is completed, we performed melt curve analysis with the same real-time PCR system. Surprisingly, the melting curve shows that the fluorescence intensity drops quickly at 18-35 degrees Celsius, which does not correspond to the previous data. However, this might be caused by the assymetry of association and dissociation kinetics of DFHBI docking, which was never studied in the previous literature. Another interesting point is that both miniSpinach and aptamer-target pairs share 2 melting temperatures, suggesting a two-step mechanism of DFHBI docking. Nevertheless, the temperature where the probe achieves optimal performance is around 18 degrees Celsius, while room temperature incubation can also achieve a very goof fluorescence signal, which is user-friendly (See Fig 3.2)

Mingdao,2017,Team:Mingdao#Demonstrate_-_-_TEXT.html,"2. And teams Uppsala and TMMU_China were using it to select the engineered Lactobacillus with erythromycin resistant strains.
However, the BioBrick parts containing the erythromycin resistance gene are currently unavailable. On the other hand, iGEM HQ is unable to service the request of plasmid carrying erythromycin resistance gene. Maybe iGEM HQ can’t manipulate erythromycin resistant bacteria so far.
Therefore, we decided to clone the erythromycin resistance gene (EmR) by ourselves. We searched the vector carrying EmR and found an iGEM team HKUST in 2010 working with it. We got the pMG36e vector from the team and cloned the EmR gene out onto pSB1C3 followed by assembling RBS (B0034) and double terminator (B0015) parts. These will provide iGEM team this resistance gene as selection marker in the future.
Recombination Vector with Reporter and Selection Marker

Finally, we assembled the pLBA169 vector with RBS-EmR part as a recombination vector of Lactobacillus acidophilus with the selection marker of erythromycin.

Erythromycin
First of all, we have to determine which concentration of erythromycin is suitable for selection of Lactobacillus. We tried to culture Lactobacillus on MRS agar plate with or without 1.25 μg/ml of erythromycin in an anaerobic environment. As the photo showed, Lactobacillus grew on MRS agar plate but can’t grow on the plate with 1.25 μg/ml of erythromycin, which is consistent with the recommended concentration for Lactobacillus selection

Lack of better chassis
Nowadays, Synthetic Biology studies are limited by a few numbers of chassis, such as bacteria (Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis) and yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae).
One of the major problems of drug therapies are the side effects: other non-target tissues can be affected, causing discomfort or even causing the appearance of another syndrome. A treatment directed at the diseased location without affecting surrounding tissue, may be more effective and cause side effects of lower intensity and less severe.
A problem-solving approach
A brand new chassis!
The protozoan Leishmania is a good new chassi:
1) It has the ability to infect macrophages (Selvapandiyan et al., 2004);
2) It has the ability to express proteins with proper post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation and disulfide bonds;
3) It has the ability to deliver those proteins inside macrophages.
Leishmania: relax, it is biosafe!
The visceral Leishmania donovani strain with the virulence factor Centrin-1 deleted (LdCen1) has very low risks of contamination, and its virulence reduction has been evaluated and confirmed with different animal models, such as mice (Selvapandiyan et al., 2006), hamsters (Selvapandiyan et al., 2009), and dogs (Fiuza et al., 2014).
The genetically targeted and defined attenuation reduces the risk of reversal to virulence, a concern generally raised for attenuated organisms that are created by random genomic mutations.
LdCen1 deletion specifically attenuated the amastigote stage of the parasite that replicates inside macrophages, and has no effect on the growth of the promastigote form (Selvapadiyan et al., 2012).
In addition, we propose a kill switch system based on the genetic control of enzyme 3'-nucleotidase/nuclease, which is crucial for the purine rescuing on the promastigote form of Leishmania, the one which is spread by the sandflies, aiming to keep the modified parasite from spreading. The enzyme's synthesis would be regulated by a Tetracycline repressor and so the Leishmania would be cultivated in the presence of Tetracycline.
Our proposal
We propose the use of an optimized visceral Leishmania strain to direct IFN-β to specific macrophages associated"

We summarized all question into a venn diagram for easier analysis:
As expected, the physics students were focused on the applications side of our whereas the biology students were focused on the biological aspect of our project. Common questions asked by both classes was about the feasibility of our project in real world.
Upon reflection of this outreach it was indeed a valuable tool that allowed us to direct project and consider the chemical synthesis of magnetite nano-particles.
Following the outreach to A-level biology and physics pupils we decided to chemically synthesise magnetite to compare to the samples that proteins produced in order to intergrate the some of the central questions from the feedback we got from the pupils. This would allow us to expand our project to see if the nanoparticles differ in terms of size and shape.
We contact Dr Marc Williams from the University of Kent who is an expert on magnetic nanoparticles applications. Dr Williams completed his PhD on the uses of magnetic nanoparticles in chemotherapy. Together we looked at the methods and papers we had gathered. Dr Williams suggested to follow an ethylene glycol reduction method. This method was attempted unsuccessfully. We returned to Dr Williams to troubleshoot, he then recommended a co-precipitation method. This second method was successful and we produced magnetic nanoparticles. Therefore, talking to the expert has influenced how we approached our project, we were able to decide biological synthesis was preferred to the chemical synthesis because we have better control of the particles produced, it provides a renewable source.

Introduction
Our main aim is to set a new standard for human practices with an approach that is unique. We hope to achieve this by introducing a new type of mathematical modelling called ‘Topic
Modelling’, which was is a Big Data approach invented just over a decade ago. As far as we know, according to Google and Yahoo search engines, no iGEM team to date has applied topic models to quantitatively analyze the context and the impact of their project as part of their integrated human practices.

    Human practice is one of iGEM’s most important features that makes the competition very different from the other. This year, Team Tsinghua-A organized a series of activities based on their own understanding of what human practice is. All the activities share some common characteristics.
    Interaction oriented——Team members engage all stakeholders by idea exchange.
    The thought of “all”——We want to create science culture for the whole society to help community members to stay creative and productive. Therefore, our activities include people from all generations.
    Balance between “rigorous” and “interesting”—— the nature of science is rigorous, while we can make it as interesting as possible to make science accessible for ordinary people. How to balance between those two aspects can be a meaningful question to explore.
    Tsinghua-A has been thinking about what their projects can bring to the world before they picked up the first pipette in lab. As one of our initial goal stands, we would like to make science a resource beyond universities and institutes and create science culture for our community. To reach this goal, we put forward our interesting project to the public and are curious to see what effect can be sparked out of the interaction. What can science bring to the public and what science gets in return is an interesting topic that we would like to explore.

Proteins have long been known to respond differently to thermal fluctuations in their environment.  Through our research, we identified a cassette of chromoproteins that by either losing or changing their color, specifically indicate the temperature of their environment.  This color change is also highly sensitive in a range of temperatures for each chromoprotein, providing a fast method for measuring the temperature in a sample.  By characterizing the color degradation of each chromoprotein, we are able to produce a novel biological tool for measuring temperature in a standardized manner. Additionally, no extensive research has characterized these color-temperature profiles before. Having quantified the color expression profile dependency on temperature of each chromoprotein, we incorporated unique chromoproteins into a cassette of multiple chromoproteins.  Through this cassette, we are able to expand beyond a single chromoprotein’s range of detection to measure a wider range of temperatures via using each chromoprotein’s characteristic color-temperature degradation curve.
•Applied Design - Required link: https://2016.igem.org/Team:Stanford-Brown/Design
Our chromoprotein research not only characterized the way in which chromogenic proteins lose or change colors in response to heat, but also was expansive enough to identify a large enough span of chromogenic proteins that differentially respond to temperature. Using this differential response, we were able to construct a biological thermometer made up of six different chromogenic proteins. Each of the proteins in this set loses or changes color at a specific and distinct temperature. Lastly, we added a cellulose binding domain to these chromogenic proteins to allow them to bind to cellulose, allowing for the creation of a biologically-based paper thermometer. Having a toolset of thirteen differently-colored chromoproteins is like a functional paint set for a biological artist. We were able to use wax-based printer paper to create images like the NASA logo with our chromoproteins and even carry one experiment up into the upper atmosphere with the permission of iGEM HQ and the US EPA.

We further discovered that potentially all of the components that we need for the construct are in the iGEM 2012 Spring Distribution Kit! So we could start straight away once we have got the primers.
Our final designation or the team also occurred today, with us formalising our plans for the Summer in terms of the modules we are hoping to undertake. If all goes well, you should be able to see our modules under the project page .
Friday
Charlie had a brief chat with Dr. Vijayraghavan about potential applications of our project. She offered some useful advice given her proximity to the Bangalore and Caltech teams. See what she had to say in the human practices page .
Our newly inoculated bacteria shine ever brighter, with their induction by arabinose creating more successful results than before. In particular, Andreas and Emmy took them down to the dark room and tested if Andrea's electronics were sensitive to the light levels given off by the cultures. And surprisingly enough, it worked! A consistent 5-6% increase of the original base reading. The change was reliable and repeatable. The only worry is the time period for which light is produced by the bacteria after induction; full luminesence only takes place about 5 hours after the inducing arabinose is added.
Construct design by Tom continued, with the construct for the ratiometric emission by YFP and CFP based upon inducer concentration being made in a couple of hours. Difficulties persist with the construction of the lux operon for bacillus however. There really isn't enough data in the literature to make the RBS's properly - something which we may aim to rectify.
Lastly, the primer redesign was successful. Unfortunately, primer ordering is hampered by a lack of any add to basket button on the Sigma-Aldritch. Even more unfortunately, this week seems to be holiday week for the whole of the department, and everyone who could help is away. Something may have to be done over the weekend.

Wageningen_UR,2016,Team:Wageningen UR#Model_-_-_TEXT.html,". These are further analysed by examining the population dynamics of worker bees and Varroa mites over time. In Figure 20B and Figure 20C these are shown, respectively, for a colony barely surviving a Varro mite infestation,  and a thriving colony, regardless of the presence of Varroa mites at the start of the simulations. When the colony is barely surviving we can see that worker bee and Varroa mite populations reach a dynamic equilibrium. For comparisons sake we also show in figure 20A with population dynamics when BeeT.
Figure 20: The honey bee population is shown in blue and the Varroa mite population in red. A: Colony rapidly declines when no BeeT is present. Starting population is 20 Varroa B: Colony barely survives Varroa mite infestation. Shows Varroa mite in red and worker bee population in blue. Starting population is 20 Varroa. C: Colony thrives regardless of Varroa mite infestation. Starting population is 20 Varroa mites and rapidly declines. D: Colony thrives regardless of heavy Varroa mite infestation. Starting population is 10,000 Varroa mites.
When the colony is thriving, the starting Varroa mite population rapidly declines and disappears as shown in Figure 19C. In the Figure you can see that the Varroa mite population is never able to establish itself. This indicates that the treatment is effective for a low population of initial Varroa mites. We further analysed a situation with a starting population of 10,000 Varroa mites which is shown in Figure 20D. Even with a higher starting population and a high initial virus load, we can see that the treatment is successful in reducing Varroa mite populations and that the colony recovers.
How Was The Model Analysed?
The beehave model utilizes multiple number generators to calculate mortality amongst Varroa mites and bees. These generators increase the variance inherent in the model and, as such, it is advisable to use multiple replicates per parameter set. To determine the error bars we ran a simulation where we varied the Varroa mite mortality, and plot the mean worker bee population over 10 years with 10 replicates per value of Varroa mite mortality. This was done for the first version of the beehave model, which governs year round Varroa mite mortality when they emerge from a brood cell.

PlastiCure is a biological system designed to harbor 2 modules: degradation and synthesis. We imagined creating interchangeable versions of each module. This would enable us to degrade a different plastic and still synthesize Erythromycin A, or to degrade PET but synthesize a different molecule. PlastiCure has been thought in a modular fashion in order to produce a broad diversity of products, as an incentive to the industry to promote plastic waste recovery.

I.Introduction
In solid media, things are not so easy as it is in the liquid media. In this case, the bacteria are not mixed at once. Besides, we have to consider the influence of the initial position of each bacterium. Like the situation in liquid media, now for solid media, we still have three characters, the farmers, the warriors and the beggars. And the cute bacteria still face the severe war against another battalion. Now let us learn more about them.
Farmers are aimed to produce resources for all the bacteria. In our experiment, the ‘farmer’ bacteria can generate glucose; while in our online game, they can produce food for others to make their lives. But be careful, your farmer’s food can also be eaten by the enemies so you need to take care of where to initialize them.
Warriors’ skill is to kill enemies. No matter what the enemy is, your brave warriors can kill both farmers and beggars from the enemy troop and can fight against your enemy’s warriors as soon as they meet. But these little combatants can’t make a living without the food from farmers so you have to initialize them within the nutrition range around farmers.
Beggars are so lazy that they just sit around doing nothing. They don’t produce food so they have to rely on farmers. Also, they are not part of the military force so they kill ‘nobody’.

OUC-China,2017,Team:OUC-China#Demonstrate_-_-_TEXT.html," we run qPCR towards corresponding protein in order for a further validation of different promoter-terminator combination’s expression on a post-transcriptional level.
The result from qPCR assay shows that at the 22nd hour from setting up culture, the circuits reached the highest expression intensity and the expression level of four circuits is shown below.
Fig. G The relative transcription level of yECitrine and mStrawberry at the 22nd hour from setting up culture. Error bars represent standard deviation of three biological replicates.
However, the transcript level of yECitrine doesn’t matched the fluorescence very well. We infer that it may be caused by the experimental error of the total mRNA concentration and the little mismatch of the primers.
Luckily, we can still learn that the transcript level of mStrawberry is very low, which means the transcriptional read through of both CYC1t and MINI terminator can be overlooked; they can efficiently terminate the transcription, which confirmed the assumption before.
Conclusion
To draw a conclusion, from our experiments, we confirmed the superiority of the MINI-GRE (MINI promoter-MINI terminator pair), which can be summed into three aspects:
(1) Short but strong, which decreases the possibility of undesired homologous reorganization and provide significant output strength compared with commonly used promoter-terminator pair.
(2) Versatile,which can work in different yeast strains and provide robust function for extensive application.
(3) Well-modularited, has good modularity because of the low transcriptional read through efficiency from minimal terminator, which is an important characteristic in synthetic biology.

An oligo that could integrate this change was design using MODEST [5]. These oligos were successfully integrated into the two strains: ​∆mutS::beta-neoR and ∆mutS::GP35-neoR.
Achievements
Made Bacillus subtilis 168 WT MAGE compatible
Showed that the MODEST program can make oligoes that can be inserted in Bacillus. subtilis 168.
Introducing Multiplex Automated Genome Engineering (MAGE) in Bacillus  subtilis 168.
MAGE competent strains
All the strain were made by homologous recombineering. Plasmids containing cassettes that were able to do a double-crossover homologous recombineering into the genome of B. subtilis 168 (referred to as knockout (KO) plasmid). These were used to, simultaneously, delete the desired gene (amyE or mutS) and inserting the expression cassette for one of the recombinases: beta or GP35.
Figure 1. Shows the general concepts of the two plasmids pDG268neo_recombinase and pSB1C3_recombinase. Both exist in two versions, one with each of the recombinase proteins CDSs (Beta and GP35). They also have different RBSs since they are optimized for the CDS. Upstream of neoR is a promoter and RBS and downstream of neoR is a terminator, but sequences and positions of these features are not known.
 
Four different plasmids were assembled to make the four MAGE ready strains:
pDG268neo_Beta-neoR
pDG268neo_GP35-neoR
pSB1C3_Beta-neoR
pSB1C3_GP35-neoR
 
Insert of recombinase in amyE
For pDG268neo_recobinase a DNA sequence containing following features
●      Promoter: PliaG from BBa_K823002 was used.
●      RBSs were optimized for the specific CDS using the salis lab RBS calculator ( https://www.denovodna.com/software/ )
●      CDS for recombination protein beta or GP35
●      Terminator: we use rho-independent Part:BBa_B0014

What your work has given us:
Since this experiment was launched, around 40 CSE kits have been returned, allowing us to plate them out and find bacteria able to degrade polystyrene. The best kit that has been returned so far has been kit 01#502, which has yielded 2 different types of bacteria (we're not sure whether they are the same species, but instead just different strains). Both types of bacteria were growing together on a polystyrene-minimal media plate, which could indicate a mutual relationship in polystyrene degradation. Later experiments (see polystyrene growth experiment) were conducted to confirm they were using polystyrene.
The 01#502 kit was the main focus of our experiments in the later stages of August and September, as they were bacteria living on the polystyrene. Several streams of experiments were then run to isolate DNA, sequence the genome and give us a much better understanding of the processes involved in the polystyrene degredation.
    Sponsored walk
On Saturday the 3rd of March, some of our team undertook a sponsored walk along the River Soar, from Leicester to Loughborough - Our first fundraising event. The money we raised helped close the gap to the $2000 target to pay for registration to iGEM by the 31st March. For more information about the walk, please visit the blog or facebook
From the walk we raised over £600 before we started the walk, however the final figure after collection of all the money was much higher at £975 . The total distance walked was closer to 18 miles in the end as there were miscalculations in the distance, but it was a very fun day, getting lots of people interested in the project as we walked along.
We would also like to take this opportunity to thank everyone who sponsored us on the walk. Without you, and the kind people at the Genetics department none of this would have been possible

Arsenic Side project
Inorganic arsenic is a potent human carcinogen and toxicant which people are exposed to mainly via drinking water and food. While originally thought that it is not a global problem, according to research presented at the annual Royal Geographical Society meeting in London in 2007 the problem is bigger than earlier suspected, and it affects nearly 140 million people in more than 70 countries. For the full story read here .
There are three regions well known as being affected by this problem, Bangladesh, US and Hungary.  A map of the US arsenic situation can be found here . And you can find additional informations here .
The current situation of the arseinc problem in the drinking water of  the south east region of Hungary can be found here: Arsenic in drinking water and mortality in the  Southern Great Plain, Hungary .
Although Hungary has already invested huge sums of money to reduce arsenic levels in the water the strict European threshold value is still not reached by the drinking water in some places. We decided that the undergraduate students of our team should focus on the testing of the iGEM Biobrick componenets of the 2010 distribution and test it on water samples collected by Lilla Ozgyin in Békéscsaba.
The description of the iGEM Biosensor can be found here . The system was developped by the Edinburgh Team in 2006 and we contacted the team for getting advice about how this biosensor works.

Not only have we demonstrated that the enzymes are active we have also confirmed the different activities reported in Hofbauer et al 2014. This data can now be used to determine which chlorite dismutase will be most suitable for use in our bioreactor in collaboration with the information provided by our modelling.
By demonstrating expression and activity of D. aromatica Cld we have improved Leiden's parts We have also added two new parts to the registry: the Cld's from A. oryzae and A. suillum.
Perchlorate reductase
The Pcr enzyme complex: PcrAB catalyses the reduction of perchlorate to chlorite. PcrC is a cytochrome-type protein that provides electrons to PcrAB, and PcrD is an essential accessory protein thought to provide the molybdenum co-factor to PcrAB.  The operon encoding this enzyme complex had to be synthesised in two separate parts due to it's length. Previous teams have also struggled to work with such a large operon. Our question for the pcrABCD operon was:
""Can we clone the operon into a suitable transformation vector, and can we express the 4 enzymes?""
The T7 promoter from pET21A was inserted upstream of the pcrA coding sequence flanked by the BioBrick prefix and suffix. The B0034 RBS was inserted upstream of each of pcrB, pcrC and pcrD, and the B0015 was inserted downstream. This entire sequence was flanked by the BioBrick prefix and suffix. Both of these individual parts were synthesised by IDT and the BioBrick assembly method was used to construct the entire operon in pSB1C3.
Figure 9: Gel electrophoresis after restriction enzyme digest of the two separate parts for assembly of the pcrABCD construct
Figure 9 shows successful digests of the individual parts and the pSB1C3 backbone. Bands were excised from the gel and using a Promega Wizard gel extraction kit, the DNA was purified. The three parts were combined in a ligation reaction with T4 DNA ligase (ThermoFisher). Transformation into DH5α, growth of overnight cultures followed by DNA miniprep extraction yielded DNA that was sent for Sanger sequencing. This confirmed, to our great surprise and joy, that we had"

Public Forum
In an effort to communicate about our project with the general public of Lansing, we planned a public forum focused on educating attendees about synthetic biology, our project, and controversy over genetically modified organisms (GMOs). We created a slideshow detailing these topics and then held a question-and-answer session with a panel of five MSU professors specializing in philosophy, plant biology, biochemistry/molecular biology, agriculture, and computational biology. These professors graciously agreed to appear on our panel as unpaid volunteers.
Garden 25th Birthday Bash
The MSU Horticulture Gardens hosted a celebration for its 25th birthday on July 14, 2018 from 10 am - 12 pm, during which visitors went on a tour of the gardens and visited booths set up throughout the gardens. Our team set up a booth at the gardens for this event. At our booth, we had a banner with our team logo on it, a trifold poster explaining synthetic biology and our project, brochures explaining the goals of our project (which were intended for older children and adults), and a simple experiment (which was intended for younger children). The experiment consisted of learning simple pipetting skills and predicting liquid quantities. The event staff predicted that over 200 people visited the gardens that day and we had 100 visitors to our booth, the majority of which were children ages 3 to 9 and their parents. This event was unique in that it allowed us to educate both children and their parents about synthetic biology in a fun and engaging way.
Garden Plot
We planted ten Brachypodium plants in the MSU Horticulture Gardens. They were accompanied by a sign that gave brief explanation of our project goals. We also included our team’s social media (Facebook and Instagram) usernames. The plants and sign were in the gardens from June to October. Our hope was that visitors to the gardens would learn a little bit about synthetic biology and want to learn more.

We now have in hand, all of the parts necessary to build each circuit. We are literally one cloning step away. We also have acquired sufficient experience with colour development and plasmid loss that we think we have a reasonable chance of making it work. The spatial demonstration that we are aiming for is shown below. Here three wells sit on the vertices of an equilateral triangle and are loaded with the indicated combinations of inducers. Cells expressing either the plasmids required for the auto-repressible circuit or the cross-repressible circuit are plated as a lawn under nonselective conditions (no antibiotics) and then we shall see what we see, hopefully before the competition! Eventually we would like to expand the circuit to a full ROYGB spectrum in a way that converts the white readout to yellow. WE’RE PUMPED!!
                                   
Achievements
Introduced  three great protein colors into our lab: RFP (red), amilGFP (yellow in visible light), and blue chromoprotein amilCP with useful modifications such as new RBS sequences that were calculated (Salis RBS calculator) and tested. For amilCP, the new RBS is substantially stronger than the existing Registry part (K592009); for RFP, color expression is substantially worse (E1010) Those calculated for LacI and TetR are functional. Different RBSes that work, increase the sequence diversity available which is good for minimizing recombination when used in combination.
We currently have these colors expressed from multiple constitutive and inducible promoters that were selected for stability and growth while still maintaining vibrance under different types of culture conditions.
Designed and tested new versions of the common repressor proteins, LacI, and TetR which lack the LVA degradation tag.
Tuned control system for inducible gene expression with repressor being generated on same high copy plasmid as the controlled gene as self-contained system that works in complete media.
Developed two complementary versions of system for expanding the dynamic range of gene expression plasmid copy number control. Our controllable copy number plasmids form a generally useful kill switch for genetically modified organisms at risk of environmental release and as a positive selection cloning strategy not based on toxicity ie ccB.
The colour genes have been sequenced (both strands), validated and submitted to the registry.
The copy-control backbones have been validated, submitted  and will have been sequenced before the competition.
Experience in general: SynBio is harder than it looks and not always as preached. RBSes are not modular and tools designed to side-step"

Design
In biological aspect, BNU-China wants to solve the questions of plasmids’ genetic and structural instability, which directly cause strain’s degeneration and then weaken the function of target genes. These instability and degeneration-related influence can be clearly valued by observing expression-related phenomenon, like the amount of production and enzyme activity.
Design: Specific gene circuit:
We firstly design the gene loops described in figure 2. When engineered strains produce the wanted product, the downstream growth factor will be expressed and accelerate the growth of strains. In opposite situation, the growth factor will not be activated and strains will relatively get the growth inhibition.
Fig.2 Design of the product-specific loop.
It contains three composition.1) Exogenous pathway transformed into strains. In this scheme, pathway is consist of gene1 and gene 2. Genes’ co-work can catalyze the precursor to the product. 2) Repressor. Repressor can specifically bind with promoter at the upstream of growth factor. It also can bind with product, then change its conformation and release from promoter, allowing the subsequent genes expressed. 3) Growth factor. It can give engineering bacteria growth advantage, making engineered-strains a relatively dominant species compared with degenerated strains.
In order to use specific experiments to verify our first idea, we separate the loop into three modules. Module 1 is growth factor module aiming at give strains the growth advantage. Module 2 includes a valuable product, a specific allosteric protein, and a negtive promoter. General relationship in module 2 can be clarified by that in β-galactosidase, lac1 repressor and lac promoter. Module 3 is where the product can be generated.

Overview of the project
Abstract
The main focus of our project this year was enzyme design and discovery. We chose to engineer enzymes because they are a practical technology for removing stains, already known to be safe and economical. However, in our search for microbes that produce stain-removing enzymes we discovered something else: microbes are beautiful. When nutrients are added to fabric samples, bacterial and fungal colonies bloom in every size, shape and color. These microbes grow in beautiful patterns, remove pigments from fabric and leave other pigments behind. When the microbes were gone, the color and texture of the fabric was changed in ways that looked cool to us. What we describe below is not necessarily practical and only somewhat scientific. We are playing around with microbes on ordinary denim blue jeans and trying to create beauty.
Motivation and Background
Blue Jeans: Structure and Function
Jeans are trousers made with denim, a cotton textile. Blue jeans are dyed with indigo, a plant-derived pigment that is now mostly produced synthetically. In a classic blue denim weave, the warp thread is dyed with indigo while the weft threat is left white. The resulting fabric is blue on one surface, white on the other, with a grainy texture where the fibers cross. The blue threads are stained only on the outside and stay white at the core. As a result, the fabric lightens with wear, producing a characteristic fading pattern (Figure 1).

Calgary,2017,Team:Calgary#Secretion_-_-_TEXT.html," we added the C-terminus of HlyA to the end of a phasin molecule. Phasin, coded for by phaP, is a small structural protein found in bacteria that naturally produce PHB. It binds to intracellular PHB, and therefore the PHB granules with bound phasin-HlyA tag are secreted as one.
Figure 1: The hemolysin Type I secretion pathway used for PHB secretion. When the HlyA secretion tag fused to phasin is recognized by HlyB, three membrane transport proteins (HlyB, HlyD, and TolC) assemble at the plasma membrane. PHB granules with the attached phasin-HlyA fusion protein are secreted as a whole from the cell.
Our Construct- Part: BBa_K2260002
To design our Biobrick for PHB secretion, we used BBa_K2018024 from the SDU-Denmark 2016 team. This part contains a coding region for phasin (phaP), originally from Ralstonia eutropha, as well as a coding region for the HlyA secretion tag, originally from E. coli. Since our chassis is E. coli BL21(DE3), we codon optimized the entire sequence for E. coli to improve protein expression and removed restriction sites to make it compatible with all iGEM RFC assembly standards. We chose to use an IPTG-inducible T7 bacteriophage promoter to upregulate the production of Phasin-HlyA Tag because it has been observed that increased production of Phasin may decrease PHB granule size, which could increase the efficiency of PHB translocation across the cellular membrane (Maehara et al., 1999).  Also, genes under the control of an inducible promoter have much higher rate of transcription than those that are constitutive. The E. coli BL21(DE3) genome contains a coding region for T7 RNA polymerase under the control of an IPTG-inducible promoter, and it was therefore chosen as an ideal chassis. Furthermore, a FLAG tag (amino acid sequence DYKDDDDK) was added to the N-terminus of the Phasin-HlyA fusion protein for easier isolation of our protein during protein expression analyses.
Our BioBrick ( Part: BBa_K2260002 ) was designed with the standard prefix and suffix so that it could be used in the pSB1C3 vector, which has chloramphenicol resistance and is the standard vector used for iGEM.

Each sample used for measure the absorbance contain a fixed amount of chromic acid. The absorbance of the chromic acid will represent the total amount of ethylene glycol inversely. It means that if the absorbance is high, the amount of ethylene glycol in solution is low, and if the absorbance is low, the amount of ethylene glycol in solution is high. If the absorbance is high, the amount of chromic acid is high, which means that the amount of ethylene glycol being oxidized by chromic acid is low and vice versa. Both of LC Cutinase UC Davis and OmpA-LC Cutinase ITB_Indonesia shown the degrading activity of PET become ethylene glycol as once of the product.The optimum time to produce ethylene glycol is on the fourth hour after inoculation.

Voltage Switch
Voltage Sensor Peptide (Protein Domain BBa_K1092006 )
Voltage sensor peptide, from Aeropyrum pernix, is a protein domain found in a transmembrane potassium ion channel. It contains positively-charged 4 arginine residues, and also numerous hydrophobic leucine residues. Study has shown that this helical voltage sensor peptide is capable of moving within the membrane under external voltage. To further adapt this voltage sensor peptide into our project, we added in glycine serine flexible linker, and polyproline rigid linker.

It is a protein domain found in a transmembrane potassium ion channel from Aeropyrum pernix, which is highly voltage dependent. It contain positive charges from the 4 arginine residues, and also numerous leucine residues which give it high hydrophobicity. All these together make it an excellent voltage sensing peptide in the transmembrane region. Study has shown that this helical voltage sensor peptide is capable of moving across the membrane under external voltage, which is the key to the voltage dependence of the ion channel (PMID"

When we further observed the growth independence on tryptophan addition, we found our desired positive relationship between tryptophan and growth with tetracycline concentration to be around 84 and 120 ug/mL and in the host carrying plasmid pTrc99A_trp sensor_RBS-ori_tetA. The results were shown in Figure. 5. For our bitter pressure part with RBS B0030 and B0032, desired positive relation was very poor. For these system with in vitro tryptophan addition, we could clearly found that in the control group (tetracycline=0mg/L) tryptophan addition showed significant inhibit to cell growth, which significantly reduced the positive function to growth caused by tryptophan addition and following tetA expression. What was more, in vitro tryptophan addition might face kinetics problem. Amino acid was transported into the cell by positive transport mechanism and the concentration of amino acid was quite different in and out of the cell . Our test system might fail due to the poor and similar intracellular tryptophan concentration although quite different extracellular concentration. Although such unexpected things happened, we still obtained weak but clear desired growth property in one certain system with certain tetA expression level. To overcome the problems mentioned before and proved bitter part’s possibility in in vivo evolution, we designed following in vivo system for further characteristics.

I. Why we design this project?
The relationships between populations and individuals are very complex. For gregarious animals like ants, there exists an ant society, in which a clear division of labor can be seen. Despite of it, how the society is organized is still a mystery. For animals so simple as ants, the interactions between individuals still involve lots of genes. Similarly, for us human, how our society works is also a very complicated problem. Though difficult to study, the knowledge of the organization of societies is really precious as it directs our further research into behaviors and more importantly, gives us more angles to view history and instructs us to make the present society better.
As all of these systems are too complicated and uncontrollable, it is hard for us to study these systems directly to understand the nature of these relationships. To achieve this goal, this year we decided to use our knowledge of synthetic biology to construct a simple system which can be used to simulate many kinds of relationships between individuals and populations. Through this system, we can simplify the complex natural system so we can get a better understanding of these relationships.
What is more, we found that it will be much easier to consider effects of some factors (Like initial number of each populations and spatial factors) on population interactions if we can visualize it. Therefore, we designed our game---E.coli War ( Game Overview & Discovery ) to satisfy our needs.
Despite of the research values of our system, we found that as it is very simple and even kind of fun, it can be easily understood by the public. Therefore, we use our game to make more kids"

SCU_China,2013,Team:SCU China#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," and GFP-ssrA was put after cre-ssrA, Plac was used to replace luxpR.
Therefore, we can simply construct this device, and test its function without the need for other systems. We could use IPTG to induce the Plac, and detect the fluorescence of GFP and RFP to test whether the “Controlled DNA Invertase device” works.
Achievements
We have successfully construct Ptet-reverse Lox-reverse PO-RFP( BBa_K1087016 ), and sequence results were good. What’s more, RFP were normally expressed, obsevred and measured. See results:
We also build a model about the function of  Controlled DNA Invertase device, see model:
 
Real-time fluorescence reporter
Functionality
Real-time reporters was used to report the changes in E.coli immediately and in time. In our project, GFP and RFP were expressed in G+ and G- respectively. When G+ differentiated into P+ because of the DNA invertion in “Controlled DNA Invertase device”, we need real-time reporters to tell us it’s time to move to the next step.
 
Construct process
Since mature GFP is very stable, we need a GFP with ssrA degradation tag. (reference: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC106306/ ). We constructed the real-time GFP reporter BBa_K1087013 by assembly four biobricks from distribution kits: BBa_I712074, B0034, BBa_E0044,and teminator BBa_B0015.
 
We also constructed some other reporters to be used:
T7 promoter + constitutive promoter + mRFP1, BBa_K1087020
In this part, the reporter mRFP1 was controlled by both the strong T7 promoter and one weak constitutive promoter BBa_J23117. Thus, it was strongly expressed when cotransfected with T7 polymerase while less expressed alone.

Evry,2016,Team:Evry#Design#PLAsystem_-_-_TEXT.html,". He recommended the use of two SEVA (Standard European Vector Architecture) plasmids [5] , which were:
pSEVA224: IPTG inducible promoter and Kanamycin resistant gene
pSEVA2311: Cyclohexanone inducible promoter and Kanamycin resistant gene
An efficiently way of building our plasmid was indeed making an operon with the two genes (PhaC and Pct). According to their length we had to synthetize them separately with our IDT gBlocks. In the synthesis, we also included RBS from Pseudomonas putida genomic DNA before and close to the genes to prevent missing initial codon during translation. Finally, we added biobrick prefix and suffix in the synthesis. For the next steps, we worked in parallel with the two versions of the PhaC gene that we had.
Standard assembly method
Thinking on the design of the operon, we decided to put the PhaC gene before the Pct, as the polymerization is the bottleneck of our system and we assumed that proximity to the promoter was more necessary than for Pct, as it could provide more expression.
We wanted to put this operon in pSEVA224 plasmid in order to express it in P. putida. Figure 3 is a map of the region between promoter and terminator in pSEVA224.
We included the operon in this region by digesting the plasmid with Ecor1 and Pst1. In the final construct, the operon is under control of the inducible promoter of pSEVA224. Figure 4 is the final plasmid map containing the operon.
Figure 2. Standard assembly for construction of operon. We would use restriction enzymes to construct our PhaC-Pct operon from the separate fragments on gBlocks.

For the D-LDH* gene, we aimed to express it in the same cell to increase the yield of PLA. The constructed plasmid pSEVA 224 with our operon was >8kb, for what we decided that it was more convenient to use a different plasmid to express LDH. The first strategy was to use pSEVA2311 plasmid and take profit of playing with two different inducers to control when we wanted more precursor (l"

However, after                     many attempts, we didn’t transform it into Bacillus subtilis R179 successfully before the wiki freeze.                     As a result, we didn’t test the pucR function successfully before the wiki freeze.

Some Bacillus subtilis strains can induce hemolysis. We tested the hemolysis ability of the Bacillus subtilis strain itself, Bacillus subtilis WB800 and Bacillus subtilis R179. The result showed that R179 is with little hemolysis                     ability. In our experiment, we decided to use R179 as our chassis. Though there was a Bacillus subtilis strain with no hemolysis ability reported, which can be our future chassis[9].

The details about the hardware can be seen in our Hardware page . In description, we’d like to only show the experiment result.
Though the microporous aperture of the fiber tube in the dialyzer is about 7-9nm, we still did the experiment to ensure the                     bacteria cannot pass through the membrane. After adding the bacteria culture and sterilized water to                     two sides of the fiber tube for more than 12h, we cultivated the liquid sampled from both sides of the                     fiber tube. The result showed that no bacteria were detected in the sterilized water side, which indicated                     that the membrane can prevent the leakage of the bacteria (Figure 17).
Figure 20 The bacteria leakage experiment. The sample from bacteria culture side grew bacteria. The sample from sterilized                     water side is with no bacteria grown, which indicated that the membrane can prevent the leakage of the                     bacteria.
After ensuring that the bacteria cannot pass through the dialyzer, we considered that bacteria might secret protein when                     grown or after death, which might pass through the fiber tube and get into the blood, leading to the                     immune response. So we did the leakage experiment to find out how much protein can be leaked. M9 with Bacillus subtilis (Bacillus subtilis was grown in LB medium overnight, bacteria was centrifuged and added                     into M9 medium) and M9 were added into the bacteria culture flask and simulated blood flask separately.                     Samples were taken for BCA protein assay at the time."

However even flash freezing some of the polystyrene sugar in liquid nitrogen (approx -180oC), then smashing the beads with a pestle and mortar made no change at all. Even using polystyrene dissolved in acetone then frozen will not be broken into smaller pieces, it just goes flat.

(9:30 am) As there was no lab supervisor yesterday the team returns to labs this morning to try evaporating off acetone which has actually dissolved a small amount of polystyrene. This involves using a heat block in the fume cupboard then seeing if the dissolved polystyrene is a powder or back in beads like before. Unfortunately our lab supervisor is away this morning as well so the team relocated to the computer room to do research and plan the meeting for the afternoon.
(14:00 pm) The team plus this weeks supervisor met up in one of the meeting rooms in the building. At this point all of the options were discussed and a plan was formed for the following few days.
(15:00 pm) A couple of members were taken to a microbiology lab to see if some P. aeruginosa could be acquired for use. Unfortunately the researcher using P. aeruginosa was out so the only thing that could be done was to produce some more plates for the bacteria to be placed on.
(16:30 pm) A few of the plates were finished but the team was told the researcher had come back so a few went back to his lab and he agreed to plate up the control, 5% polystyrene and 10% polystyrene plates with 5 different strains of Pseudomonas so the bacteria could start to grow and any results can be seen before plating up the CSE kits.

Week 10 --- 06.10.14 - 10.10.14
As a last effort for our pETue1.2 vector, we tried overexpression again, this time varying IPTG concentrations. Although the cells grew normally no overexpression could be seen on the SDS-page. We also tried to add the fluorescein labelled, synthetic C-Intein to the lysate of Intein-aGAL overexpression, hoping to spot the protein band via fluorescence. Still there were no results. With very little time remaining at this point, we decided to focus our efforts on the vectors from team Heidelberg, which arrived this week. We agreed upon using the high copy plasmid pSBX1K3. Transformation of NEB5α with the vector did work very well, so we could be ready for construction of the final expression test next week. As part of our outreach, on the Friday of this week, we invited 40 pupils of a local high school's 12th grade to a self designed practical course, which was focused on giving them an impression of working in a synthetic biology laboratory. After an introductory seminar in which we introduced synthetic biology as well as discussing iGEM and our project, we divided them into groups of four for supervising and conducted a PCR, restriction digest and agarose gel electrophoresis with them, discussed the findings and explained the methods.
Week 11 --- 13.10.14 - 17.10.14
Since it was the final week a lot of our work was focused on completing the wiki. In the final week we successfully ligated eight out of our nine construct combinations into the pSBX1K3 vector from team Heidelberg. NEB5α transformation worked well and after miniprep all constructs could be confirmed by digestion. Retransformation of BL21DE3 worked out and a final test expression of our construct was conducted. However even with the vector from team Heidelberg no expression could be seen. Even after incubation with our synthetic peptides, which should be able to fluorescently label the product, no fluorescent band could be seen in SDS-page.

11. Gently add 30uL autoclaved water to the column
12. Let column stand for 2 minutes
13. Centrifuge for 30-60 seconds to elute pure DNA into the tube and store at -20˚C until use
Inoculation
What you need:
- Falcon tubes
- The appropriate liquid media
- The appropriate antibiotic
- An agar plate containing the cells of interest or a frozen stock solution
- Autoclaved pipet tips
Procedure:
1. To an autoclaved glass test tube with lid, add: 2-5 mL liquid media, 2-5 ul antibiotic (dilute to 1/1000)
2. Using a pipet tip,  gently poke a single colony of plated cells, or scratch cells onto the stick form the frozen freezer stock (taking colonies from a plate typically yields better results)
3. Stir cells into the liquid media
4. Label the test tubes and place them in 37˚C warm room overnight to grow (12-16 hrs)
Ligations
Set-up:
1. Run a gel of your digestions and take a picture.
2. Estimate the intensities of your insert and vector where your insert (usually less intense) is considered 1 and your vector is x times as bright.
3. Once intensity is determined perform the following equation:
L = Ligation volume
S = Size of fragments
I = Intensity of fragments
V = Volume ran down gel
i = Insert
v = Vector
4. Ligation volume (Lv) for the vector should be approximately 2 µl.
5. The ratio for the ligation in the previous equation is 3:1 insert:vector but can be done 6:1 by replacing the 3 with a 6.
Reaction Mix:
- 2 µl – Vector
- Li µl – Insert
- 2 µl – 10x Buffer
- dH20 to 19 µl
- 1 µl – T4 DNA Ligase
- TOTAL – 20 µl
Procedure:
1. Add appropriate amounts of dH20, Vector, and Insert in a PCR tube (200 µl). Once added, heat mixture to 65o C for 5 min. This will remove all items that are already annealed to each other causing inefficient ligation.

Feature
Benefit
Function(s) Satisfied
Two-step reaction pathway
This is ideal to work with our two subunit-type archaeal protein, allowing for the attachment of each enzyme to a different subunit.
FR3.1: Express a minimal number of subunits
Well characterised in literature and iGEM
The depth of research on this pathway and its use by other teams enabled us to reliably highlight the function and benefits of our scaffold.
FR3.3: Provide standardised experimental procedures.
Easy to measure and quantify products
IAA is relatively easy to measure with assays such as Salkowski and HPLC. Its effect on plant root growth can also be exploited.
FR3: Facilitate accessible use.
Iteration 3 – Taxol Side-Chain Synthesis
Although we decided to use the IAA biosynthesis pathway as a proof of concept for our experimental work, consultation with industry led us to realise that IAA itself was not widely used. Therefore, the team wanted to find an enzyme pathway we could utilise in the future that would have commercial value while still demonstrating the prime functionality of our scaffold system. This led us to the Taxol side-chain synthesis pathway, which involves the synthesis of the side-chain of the anticancer drug Taxol, by the enzymes phenylalanine aminomutase (PAM) and tyrocidine synthase I (S563A) (TycA-S563A). These enzymes have a slow turnover rate which would be improved through co-localisation, making the pathway a great candidate for our Assemblase scaffold system. It was therefore decided that these enzymes would be used in the place of IaaM and IaaH in our  Enzyme Kinetics and Diffusion model when investigating the yield rates afforded by our scaffold system.
Future Developments
Although most of our design iterations in this section were focused on identifying enzymes that would be attached to the Assemblase scaffold, it should be noted that the system has the potential to accommodate a range of different proteins. Our focus on enzyme attachment stemmed from the identified need to improve product yield efficiencies for metabolic pathways. However, it would be just as simple to fuse desired proteins to the Snoop or Spy Tags opening up a range of future applications for our scaffold. One way we aimed to show this was through the attachment of fluorescent proteins for the FRET experiments

PyMol
Structure of complex of protein and other biomolecules are often saved as format of “*.PDB”. Visualization and analysis of that structure and sequence are also important to design novel engineered proteins. PyMol is used for such purposes. We used PyMol for two processes. First of all, it is used to confirm iG-like regions of FGFR are really FGF binding domain. We downloaded the FGF binding domain of FGFR from RCSB PDB and checked the sequence binds to the FGF is really marked as iG-like regions. (Interleukin receptors have iG-like regions, but they do not bind to their signal molecules.) Other process using PyMol is to visualize the structural alignment result made by Matt. PyMol saves the image of biomolecules in png format.

The lunch break was an occasion to discuss about our experiences and how works each team. We also shared some advices about  the way that we all managed our respective teams. This first day ended by the diffusion of the UEFA game and a big dance party!
The second day of the meetup was dedicated to culture and  we had the chance to do a Paris tour. The group was divided and each one did different activities. Museums tour was interesting, we discoverd many things at Jardins du Luxembourg or National Natural history museum. The activities were funny and we succeed to enrich our french culture :) !
The European Expreience was an excellent occasion to meet people and exchange ideas, great ideas and relationship were born which could open opportunities to work or could create friendships.
We enjoyed those two days and hope that we will see all those persons at Boston to meet them again and share our love of synthetic biology together!

They were both very engaged and interested in the prototype, and also had some great feedback and ideas, including incorporating videoclips onto the screen and making the “Challenges” more difficult.  We will definitely incorporate some of these into our project!  It was very exciting to see people actually interact with what we had made so far-- I couldn’t wait to hear their feedback and see how they responded.
6/19/2015: Day 15
Today's NEGEM meet up went (surprisingly) well!  Our presentations were very well received by the other iGEM teams-- we definitely stood out as a team competing on the community lab track and thus focusing on making synthetic biology more accessible and educating others about general synbio concepts rather than actually doing the science.  A majority of the other undergrads participating in iGEM are studying a form of biology-- synthetic biology, computational biology, biochemistry-- which made me a little nervous about presenting our project, but people were actually very interested and curious about our software and the technology we were using.
Later in the day there was an hour allotted for all attendees to discuss their current progress, next steps, and possible collaborations in a smaller group.  There (and in our evaluation forms!) we got some excellent feedback for making the science more accurate.  I especially enjoyed chatting with some members from the MIT and BU iGEM teams who made suggestions on certain key aspects of the scientific process to include in our program.  I have so much respect for these students who are so learned in synthetic biology and spoke to us with so much patience and willingness to help.
Traci Haddock brought up a very good point that we are in Boston, the hub of synthetic biology-- besides just doing our user testings on young kids to see how they respond, we should also reach out to some experts in the field to gauge how accurate the science is, how well they think that process is portrayed, etc.  I think that the HCI lab has many possible contacts who would be happy to help out, from trained professionals to members of other iGEM teams!
Overall, today was really wonderful! Looking forward to incorporating some of these ideas on Monday!

UMaryland,2016,Team:UMaryland#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," SDS-PAGE. This time around, we may plan on using constructs with proteins with affinity tags for purification. Running purified gels will increase the likelihood and evidence that our constructs are being expressed. Purification also allows us to perform functional assays with purified cell extract. More functional assays are planned to further prove that our constructs will work as expected.  For the formate construct we would run similar tests to those done on the fructose plasmid. For the sMMO construct we would plan to test for methanol production in the bioreactor when methane is included among the gases being pumped into the culture.
After completing several repetitions of these basic functionality tests, we plan to run several coculture experiments in the bioreactor. Here, a green fluorescent protein expressing variant of the sMMO construct would be grown in the bioreactor alongside a red fluorescent protein expressing variant of the fructose or formate construct. Growth rates of the constructs would be recorded and methanol levels upon the introduction of methane would be recorded. The hope is that the fructose/formate construct will degrade any methanol produced by the sMMO construct through its oxidation of methane.
Alongside our coculture experiments we would consider combining the sMMO plasmid with our fructose or formate plasmid. By doing so, we would have our entire system located in a single, large plasmid of about 10 to 11 thousand base pairs. Testing of this construct would be somewhat simpler as the ratios between the different enzymes would be easier control. The plasmid combination and coculture experiments would be supplemented by our mathematical modeling. Our model informs us of the concentrations of enzymes needed to sustain the metabolic reactions for a prolonged duration. As such, tuning the strength of ribosome binding sites or promoters as indicated by our modeling is critical in this step of integrating the plasmids together.
Upon the completion of these aspects of our project, we would need to decide on an exact method of implementation. As the major goal of our project is addressing methane build up in landfills, we are currently planning to incorporate our final enzymatic system including sMMO and the enzymes necessary for the subsequent degradation of methanol into custom made bioreactor. In our human practice visit we learned that landfills already have a pump and piping system to collect the gaseous emissions. Integrating a bioreactor into a piping system would thus not be so difficult. This bioreactor would be designed to uptake landfill gas under the ideal conditions to facilitate the degradation of methane by our final bacterial construct(s). Based on the testing we have done so"

Future Directions
The CHOP System can be used to improve the affinity and characterization of the fluoride riboswitch.
Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) system may be used for detecting presence of fluoride; at a certain level of fluoride, it can trigger gene expression of the GFP as the fluoride riboswitch releases terminator. This may provide a better visual mechanism for people to determine if their water can be safe to drink or not.

Observing Fluorescent Gene Stability
Introduction
One of the major issues facing genetic engineering is the overall longevity of genetic devices once inserted into organisms. An organism can be modified, but that does not ensure that the modification will last. Subsequent generations of modified organisms often lose or “break” the genetic device through mutations. Mutations that cause a device to break (or otherwise lose part of their functionality) decrease the metabolic load of that organism. This allows the mutant and its descendants to replicate and grow faster than the originally modified organism, allowing the “broken” mutant to overtake a population.
The stability of the sequence was the focus of our research over the course of the summer. We sought to identify sequences that contribute to the relative instability of genetic devices so they can be used to predict the longevity of a genetic device as well as be taken into account when creating and modifying such devices. In the spring of 2015, E. coli was transformed using various fluorescent genes and monitored for breakage, with varying results depending on the plasmid used. Five fluorescent proteins: Yellow fluorescent protein (BBa_K592101), Super-folder Yellow fluorescent protein (BBa_K864100),  Engineered Yellow fluorescent protein (BBa_E0030), Enhanced Cyan fluorescent protein (BBa_E0020), and Blue fluorescent protein (BBa_592100).
Understanding what leads to genetic instability could lead to more stable devices and thus could increase the longevity of genetically modified organisms.  Since genetic stability can be problematic for any work involving synthetic biology, we wanted to start by determining what sequence motifs make a genetic device unstable. So, in the spring, we began an experiment to study genetic instability of different plasmids in E. coli. We designed and transformed 14 plasmids into TOP10 E. coli. Then, we propagated the strains until either fluorescence was lost or the experiment was concluded.

Producing and Recycling Bioplastics
We are producing the bioplastic poly-3-hydroxybutyrate(PHB) using the organic material in the waste product, solid recovered fuel. We have also devised the first method for recycling PHB and are working with Yale to do the same for PLA. Here you will find out why.
Bioplastics have a bright future
Bioplastics are made either directly by living things or from the products they make. They are usually more environmentally friendly than petrochemically derived plastics(1) and do not rely upon finite fossil fuels. Advances in how they are produced is allowing bioplastics with controllable physical properties to be produced(3) which enables uses which mimic those of oil-based plastics. The properties of some bioplastics allow novel functions to be carried out; an exciting example of this is the production of biocompatible scaffolds which can be used in surgical treatments(4). This combination of innovations leading to improved functions and the development of novel uses combined with environmental benefits over petrochemical plastics are just some of the reasons why bioplastics are expected to flourish commercially in the coming years(5). Currently around 10% of the plastics market consists of bioplastics, with this predicted to increase to around 30% by 2020. This is a huge increase and represents significant commercial opportunities.  The predicted production of such a large amount of material requires careful consideration of  what we do once we have used the products produced, called end of life solutions.
Poly-3-Hydroxybutyrate and Polylactic Acid are two of the best developed bioplastics

PROGRAMMING SYNTHETIC SILK
Abstract
Spiders have evolved an arsenal of silk threads for various applications, using combinations of highly-repetitive silk proteins. These fibers have an extremely high range of tensile strength and elasticity, and along with their low immunogenicity, are desired by the military, medical, and fashion industries. However, spider silk farming is impractical, and alternatives are necessary for large-scale production. Inspired by nature’s design, we aim to engineer E. coli to produce genetically programmed synthetic fibers, and standardize the customization of their physical and functional properties. We have adapted Iterative Capped Assembly to modularize and flexibly control the assembly of silk domains that confer strength or elasticity in specific ratios. Varying the composition of the silk genes, or adding other functional proteins will allow precise fine-tuning of the resulting properties, and expand their practical utility. This platform can be readily applied to assemble other highly-repetitive proteins, or large genes from libraries of parts.
Projects
Customizing Silk
Modifying the genetic structure of silk can create a diverse new range of biomaterials.
With spider silk as our basis, we started to experiment with the genetic structure of silk. We rearranged portions of the repetitive DNA code to see how it affected the strength, elasticity, and spinning capabilities using Golden Gate Cloning and Iterative Capped Assembly. Click this text to learn about this portion of our project in-depth.
Functionalizing Fibers
By attaching various proteins, we can create silk with specific applications.
Glowing silk is an idea that appeals both to the scientific and artistic worlds. It is a proof of concept for the scientists, demonstrating how we are able to functionalize silk fibers, and an interesting new material to work with for the artists. This method can be applied to different kinds of proteins with different functions as well, but every idea has to start small. To see how we attached GFP to our silk constructs, click this text.
Processing Silk
Engineering our silk is only half the work, creating a tangible product is the rest.

PCR-mix
1x recipe for a 50uL PCR reaction
10uL HF buffer
HF buffer should be 5x or adjust volume so final conc. of HF is 1x.
1uL dNTP's
This can vary depending on conc. the final conc. should be 0.2mM.
3uL of forward primer
3uL fo reverse primer
The primer volume can differ quite a lot depending on which conc. you have them in. The final conc. of the each primer should be in the range of 1uM to 0.1uM but this can also be hard to generalize.
0.5uL of polymerase
This again depend on the unit per microliter conc. of the polymerase. Use approx. 2.5U per reaction.
1uL template
The conc. of template can vary and this can also be one of the variables to turn on if the PCR goes wrong.
31.5uL MQ-water
If using more or less of the previous reactant then just adjust the MQ amount so that the final volume will be 50uL
To lessen the work and use of pipette tips you can make a PCR-mastermix with the following components:
PCR mastermix
10uL HF buffer
1uL dNTP's
31.5uL MQ
0.5uL polymerase
Add this as last step as this is best for the polymerase activity.

USP-Brazil,2017,Team:USP-Brazil#Safety_-_-_TEXT.html,"2. However, it’s classified as so because it is derived from one of the virus’ protein - but modified to block that protein, which made it completely harmless to humans and very troubling for the virus.
Chassis
Another important aspect of designing a safe, implementable paratransgenesis strategy is choosing the right chassis. That are many things that factor into that, but from a safety perspective, it needs to pose as little harm to humans as possible. We go into all of that in detail in our Conceptual Framework section .
P. agglomerans, our chosen chassis, is mostly a Risk Group 1 organism. We say “mostly”, because it really depends on the strain and on the literature source you base yourself on. Some strains can cause infections in immunocompromised individuals (but pose no threat to healthy adults), while others pose no risk at all to humans. Our strain was isolated from the eucalyptus tree, and it does not cause infection to humans at all, so we considered it to be a Risk Group 1 organism. Regardless, since we had access to a Biosafety Level 2 lab, we chose to perform all our experiments with P. agglomerans there.
Tiago filling out the Safety Form. You can never be too safe!
Mosquito Experiment
Our proof of concept experiment of colonizing the mosquito midgut with transformed bacteria (you can read more about it here ) was initially suggested by Prof. Guimarães (you can read about our interview with her here ), and she oversaw the entire thing. The experiments were performed in Prof. Guimarães’ lab, which is a Biosafety Level 2 lab and has the proper infrastructure to handle the mosquitoes. In fact, since Prof. Guimarães researches genetically modified mosquitoes, they need extra safety measures. Two of her students, Helena Araújo and Rafaella Sayuri Loshino, gave us the appropriate safety training and instructed us on how to properly dissect the mosquitoes. They also accompanied us the entire time, helping us perform the experiment.
As this kind of experiment is something novel to iGEM as a whole (and even for Prof. Guimarães’ lab, too - they had never tried to colonize mosquito midguts with GMO bacteria), we made sure that her lab had the appropriate safety infrastructure, and we checked with the iGEM Safety Committee before starting.

Plan: Finish EPF-Lausanne database, finish E.coli oscillator database, update DB document. Discuss UI with Soimort and push him to work faster, discuss synchronized E.coli with Zhaoyi Li. Have fun working.
Summary: Today is Oct 7, and I have just start writing work summary of the last week in Sep. During last 2 weeks we celebrated Mid-Autumn Festival and had 7 day off for National Day, while others are enjoying themselves traveling, we iGEM team members didn’t take a day off. We have to seize every minute to make our software work! I guess I’m just too busy to write my work log, and right now I am trying my best to recall what exactly I did in the last week of Sep…
Here's what I can remember.
Zhaoyi Li looked into the nature article on synchronized ecoli clock and gave a brief lecture, then he started to analyze all the reaction and species in the model, and prepare to write the DB of it. Zhengda He’s parents came to see him, so he disappeared for 3 days or so. He has finished part of EPF-Lausanne DB but not all, so Yubo Qi kicked in to investigate the proper parameters for reaction. Unfortunately, it’s almost a hopeless task, no reliable source with specified parameters can be found, so we gave up at last.
I finished another detail draft on input UI design, and Soimort is constructing our UI according to it. I tried to discuss more with Soimort and push him harder, but can’t find the right way…

Insights: Response. Gut-on-a-chip will provide a secure way to know Lactobachill has the desired effect.
Resume
Our university will work in collaboration with the Northeastern University through Dr. Rebecca Carrier, a professor of chemical engineering, who will collaborate with our team to specifically assist in the introduction of our Lactobachill product in a gut-on-a-chip system with the intention of characterize how the product interacts with said system and especially how it modulates the immune response in a competent immune model.
Meet up
Insights: Constructive criticism. Exchange experience with other teams.
Changes: We had to rethink our strategy of communication of the project and study more about the topic
Resume Our team attended the event organized by our university but on another campus, to present our project to teachers who gave us feedback. This gave us the opportunity to know the projects of other Latin American teams and at the same time to know our areas of opportunity for improvement based on the criticism and observations of the judges. The judges made us reconsider the side effects of our product and how we could do to prevent them from being negative.

Insights: Shocking. The public will be excited of something so innovator as a psychobiotic.
Changes: We choose an appropriate name and type of product
After a lot of research, we found out depression is a disease that affects most people between 15 and 29 years old, but we decided to shorten this range to 18-25, as we considered the necessities of a 15 year old person, are very different to the ones of one 29 years old one.
After several surveys, it was found that:
o   A great portion of the target market, are not familiar with some important benefits of probiotics.
o   98% believe depression is a treatable mental disease.
o   People need to be educated regarding depression, and its relationship with intestinal well-being.
o   73 out of 86 surveyed people are interested on buying products containing probiotics.
About 54% prefer to consume probiotics in liquid presentation (non-alcoholic beverage).
·   About 49% prefer to consume probiotics in yoghurt.
·   If probiotics are found in consumers’ favorite presentations, 61% of surveyed people would consume them several times a week.

Social Media -Wechat
Nowadays, the world becomes smaller and smaller due to the booming development of internet. As time goes by, the number of internet users becomes larger and larger which makes social media the most convenient access for people to get the information they need. In China, the digital media landscape is dominated by local players, like Wechat, QQ, Sina, Youku, Tudou and so on, among which Wechat is the most prevailing one. So we applied one Wechat subscription account (SCUTChampionPark) and use it to promote iGEM, food safety, and synthetic biology related issues in public. Besides, we also introduced our team, idea and our project. It kept going as our project went on, in private, we also use it to write all the big affairs we had during the process, to some degree, it kind of likes a memo. It noted most of the important point of our project.
