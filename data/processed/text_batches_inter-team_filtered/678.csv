To produce one or more Taverna workflows, that use this web service, to show how this e-Science approach will benefit the design process (Oinn et al., 2006; Hull et al., 2006) and reduce development time.
To produce simulatable model parts in CellML, that could eventually be compiled into a complex model.
To identify design patterns or motifs which are recognisable patterns in models that can be re-used and simulated independently of the rest of the model. Identifying these motifs should aid the design process and produce re-usable parts to simplify future designs. In principle, the motifs are similar to and serves the same purpose as design patterns in computer software.
Synthetic Biology:
Chopra defines Syntehtic Biology as a field that involves the synthesis of novel biological systems which are not generally found in nature (Chopra and Kamma, 2006).
Engineering Principles:
Two design approaches to Synthetic biology are emerging, namely top-down and bottom up.
The top-down approach starts with an overview of a system. The system is studied and iteratively broken into modules until the complete system can be described in terms of minimal elements. In the bottom-up approach design starts with minimal elements that, according to certain rules, can fit together like Lego c bricks ( http://lego.com ) until a complete system is built (Heinemann and Panke, 2006).
Synthetic biologists are adopting principles from established fields of engineering to increase tractability and speed of design (Andrianantoandro et al., 2006).
We define Synthetic Biology as: Synthetic Biology is the engineering of biological systems to perform desirable and predictable functions.
Modelling languages:
Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML) was developed to represent biochemical reaction networks in a way that can be used by different software systems to exchange models ().
CellML is a mark-up language used to store and exchange computer based mathematical models. Originally it was intended for the description of biological models, but it has been adopted by several other fields of study.
Both CellML and SBML are based on the XML (Hucka, 2003; Cuellar et al., 2003). The main difference between SMBL and CellML is that in CellML the underlying mathematics of cellular models are described in a very general way.
Virtual Parts:
Cooling et al. (2010) introduce the concept of Standard Virtual Biological Parts (further on referred to as virtual parts). Virtual parts are mathematical models used to represent biological parts that can be combined to inform system design.

Our platform design, based on the expression of three main modules (Detector, Processor and Output) by three E.coli strains in co-culture, allows the switch of possible variances for each module and the production of multiple customised biosensors. This section of the project is based on testing the modularity of the system by replacing the IPTG sensing unit present in the Sensynova platform with various synthetic promoters that are regulated by small molecules.
Background Information
Promoter libraries can be created by varying many different as-pects of a wildtype promoter such as the upstream element prior to the -35 region, the downstream element, after the -10 region prior to -1, and its core sequence, between the -35 and -10 regions (Schlabach et al., 2010). In this study, we propose to use the PLac promoter sequence as our wildtype for creating promoter designs varying different areas of its sequence. One of such variation will be the substitution of the -35 and -10 currently found in PLac with the -35 (TTGACA) and -10 (TATAAT) regions found to be the most commonly occurring in E. coli natural promoters (Hawley and McClure, 1983, DeBoer, 1985, Harley and Reynolds, 1987). These were chosen to be the constant region between different promoter designs.
Figure 1: Graph Indicating the Most Frequent -35 and -10 Regions Found in E. coli Promoters. This image was taken from Harley and Reynolds (1987).
By analyzing the findings of Harley and Reynolds (1987) and Lisser and Margalit (1993), the decision to vary the number of base pairs in the region present between the -35 and -10 elements to 17 base pairs instead of the 18 present in the wildtype PLac. Variations of the upstream and downstream regions where the lac operon would normally bind to will also be investigated in this study by the production of three different promoter designs resulting in a diverse promoter library.

As seen in Figure 3(B), the regions known to be important for a reliable promoter expression (-35 and -10 regions) were changed to variant of the wildtype but kept constant between the three distinctive designs.

Paris_Bettencourt,2014,Team:Paris Bettencourt#MOOC_-_-_TEXT.html,"1500 visits and more than 1000 activity events (annotations, likes, comments, annotation edits). This platform and outreach approach has little precedence among iGEM projects and will contribute greatly to the synthetic biology and scientific community. This success was possible thanks to the MOOC network and the MOOC iGEM HS beta testers. The Genius platform allow the users to interact by rating the annotations from other users or leaving suggestions. Genius incorporates a reward system: users win IQ points as they interact, annotate, or add new pages. This creates a ranking of users per page, per tag (for example, MOOC iGEM HS), sorting them by their IQ. Users don’t have the same type of account, depending on their level of authority. For instance, teachers have educator accounts that allow them to make changes of the annotations made in their texts and create classroom pages. For our MOOC, we have to approve every annotation to make it “official”, although it is made public from the moment it has been made. Teachers found this feature to be a powerful tool to create assignments and follow the learning process of their students in a more cohesive manner. Each lesson is supplemented with a video, in which a narrator reads the text while the content is drawn in an easy to understand whiteboard format. The videos were available online with subtitles in French and Spanish. An outline of the lessons in described below (Fig. 4)
Figure 5. The feedback from high schoolers and young students has been overall positive and support our approach.
MOOC Network
Many of our efforts were focused on developing a solid network of users ready to continue the project after iGEM Jamboree 2014 is over. High school workWe are collaborating with Lycée du Valée de la Chevreuse as a prototype for starting more HS igem teams: the Biobuilder program will start there next year and the MOOC iGEM HS will be used to complement their Synthetic Biology classes. More than 15 high school teachers are currently working to include MOOC High School in their curiculum. Before launching the MOOC, we tested the platform with four classes. We received feedback from students and teachers about how to improve our course (Fig. 5). Because iGEM is an international competition we wanted to be able to reach students around the world.  Therefore we made our MOOC is multilingual and we held several workshops in October to reach a total of 90 high school students in Seville during the ""Week of Science"" fair in the University Pablo Olavide.

Lactococcus lactis toolbox
 
We started with a toolbox that will make it possible to use Lactococcus lactis as a chassis. This toolbox contains a vector, a set of constitutive promoters, several genes from the nisin operon and an excellent fluorescent marker.
 
 
 
 
Nisin operon
 
An important part of our project, that will also form a nice addition to the toolbox, is the nisin operon. The nisin operon is responsible for making and secreting the lantibiotic nisin in certain L. lactis species. Nisin inhibits the growth of a broad range of Gram positive bacteria, of which many are spoilage bacteria or pathogens. Nisin is therefore extensively used in the food industry as a preservative. Nisin forms pores in the membrane of the bacteria it kills and inhibits the peptidoglycan synthesis.2
 
The operon consists of the genes NisA, NisB, NisT, NisC, NisI, NisP, NisR, NisK, NisF, NisE and NisG and their related promoters, see figure 1. NisA is the gene that codes for the nisin precursor (1), that will be modified and transported out of the cell. The nisin precursor its serines and threonines are dehydrated by NisB and then the precursor is cyclized by NisC. After this process, the precursor is transported out of the cell (2). Here, the lead peptide is cut off by NisP (3).
Additional genes of the nisin operon are NisR and NisK (4). NisK is a membrane receptor that activates NisR when it binds nisin. NisR can then activate nisin inducible promoters, like PNisA and PNisI. At last, there are the nisin immunity genes, NisI, NisF, NisE and NisG (5). NisI, a lipoprotein, serves as the first defense, and is therefore always present in the cell that has nisin immunity. NisF, NisE and NisG form an ABC-exporter together.  They provide extra immunity and become present in the cell when nisin is"

This changes do not create a completely new toolbox but complements the system with some handy facilities improving it notably. However the system is still limited to a duplication of the plasmids size from level to level.
MoClo – YTK ( Lee et al., 2015 )
The yeas toolkit, also known as the Dueber toolbox, offers a Golden Gate based system adapted for yeast. The basic level 0 parts are classified in 8 types with optional subtypes. New basic parts are assembled into entry plasmids by restriction with BsmBI. For building level 1 cassettes at least 8 parts are assembled by a restriction-ligation step using BsaI. The innovation of this toolkit compared to the previously reviewed is the use of connector sequences for level 1 and higher assembly steps. This way plasmids for yeast can be built de novo without the need of a defined backbone. Furthermore they integrated a method for simple chromosomal integration by lenearization of the plasmids with NotI. On top of this the connectors can be used as homology sequences e.g. for ligation-independent cloning, Gibson assembly, ligase cycling reaction or yeast in vivo assembly. Although this toolkit focuses mainly on yeast it can be used for working with E. coli as well. Unfortunately this toolkit does not arrange to any standard becoming incompatible with other toolkits.
PhytoBrick ( Patron et al., 2015 )
The PhytoBrick system does not offer another genetic toolbox but a wide standard compatible with popular systems like GB 2.0 and MoClo aiming to create a standard focused primary on plant engineering efforts. The iGEM competition already accepted it as an standard and offers support for building parts designed for plants, yeast and bacteria. This system proposes 12 defined fusion sites applicable for the different genetic modules. The fusion sites are divided into three major classes for promoter parts, transcribed regions and terminator parts. This classes are divided into subclasses giving the flexibility to use optional modules like tags, promoter regulators and enhancer regions. The system also proposes two types of universal acceptor plasmids (UAPs) derived from the pSB1C3 plasmid where level 0 modules can be inserted by a single restriction-ligation step with BpiI or BsmBI respectively.

Wageningen_UR,2017,Team:Wageningen UR#HP#Ethics_-_-_TEXT.html," in-the-loop systems where the decision of the device is not affected by a human.
The technology is used to take measures or to diagnose, but the decision is made by a person, the patient. The patient is informed of the possible options as well as their consequences and then they will make an autonomous decision. For example, the current healthcare system in first world countries.
The decision is placed on a human, but that human is not the patient. This happens in accidents where the patient is unconscious or in third world countries where the means to correctly inform the respective patients are lacking and therefore the healthcare authorities will make the decision instead.
Ideally, all the societies and their healthcare systems will evolve into one that uses informed decision-making for most situations, because it is the only one that completely respects the autonomy of the patient.
What information should the patient receive?
In order for the patient to be able to take an autonomous decision, it is necessary to provide sufficient knowledge about the usage of the technology, such as why is the technology needed, what are the possible outcomes and what happens after each outcome. Although providing knowledge is important for autonomy, that does not mean that autonomy depends on knowledge. The patient will always have the right to refuse the technology even when the decision is based on feelings instead of knowledge, such as distrust of the health authorities. Furthermore, the patients have the right to refuse to receive information.
In our specific case, there is a complication because our device is based on genetically modified bacteria. In normal conditions, it is not necessary to inform about the technology behind the diagnostic but the controversial perception of genetic engineering can change the situation. Although Mantis must be approved by the government of the specific countries before use, there might be regions where the opposition to GMOs can be strong. In these cases, it is necessary to directly inform the population about the nature of the technology behind the device, so that the patient can take a decision based on their moral standards. In case that the patient refuses to accept, an alternative should be offered, even if it is slower or more expensive.
Should the diagnostic be imposed in ""worst case"" emergency cases?
The autonomy of the patient should never be ignored. It is internationally agreed that diagnostics should never be imposed. In a mortal infectious disease outbreak, the advised way to proceed is to offer the diagnostic as a way of avoiding quarantine. For example, consider an infectious disease with an incubation time. During this incubation time, the patient does not show symptoms, but it can infect other people as well as being diagnosed. Ideally, a fast screen of the population with a diagnostic test would allow distinguishing"

Documentary
In order for our project to reach commercialization and success with the public, we needed to inform ourselves as well as others of the ethics of the use of our invention. We compiled this documentary in order to inform those unfamiliar with the problem of global mercury contamination and to discuss the bioethical questions of synthetic biology as they related to our device implementation. We conducted interviews with specialists from environmental toxicology, biotechnology, and philosophy. Through our collaboration with the 2014 Colombia iGEM Team, we further examined the current mercury contamination in Colombia and around the globe.

The project was discussed with the Department of Environmental Health and Safety at our university, and a plan was devised for mercury waste disposal based on their input. General biosafety guidelines found at https://www.dehs.umn.edu/bio.htm, http://www.dehs.umn.edu/bio_pracprin.htm and http://www.cdc.gov/biosafety/publications/bmbl5/bmbl.pdf were followed.
Risks of Our Project:
In order to mitigate risks to the safety and health of team members, or other people working in the lab, gloves were used in any protocol that utilizes Ethidium Bromide, including gel electrophoresis.  Lab coats, gloves, and full face shields were used when cutting gel fragments in proximity of ultraviolet light. A lab coat, inner and outer (long cuffed) nitrile gloves, lab goggles and face shields will be used for handling mercury, and used materials were disposed of by the University of Minnesota Department of Environmental Health and Safety. In addition, there are assigned incubators, hoods, and disposal containers specifically for experiments that involved mercury.

We used non-pathogenic (BSL1) lab strains of bacteria to minimize the risk to humans. Second, our device would be air tight to prevent the bacteria from escaping and a filter to store the mercury that has been biologically remediated. Third, we could use one of the kill switch proposals that were created so that if the bacteria were"

We tried to run heterodimer analyses of each primer against the cage gene itself, but the program timed out since the cage gene is so long. In any case, not much can be done about unfavorable annealing at this point. If anything weird happens we can simply gel purify the correct band.

Phillip's notes:
Introduction:  Once again, the primers will be attempted to be design and optimized today, with the consideration of the secondary structures.
Since there was extensive secondary structure after analyzing the primers on IDT.  Some of the codons will be changed to avoid overlap.  Using the DNA codon table from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_codon_table .  The goal was to get a deltaG under 9kcal/mol for any homo/heterodimers, as suggested by IDT.
A new file was made on Benchling called PCquad Optimized 2.0.  This includes the previous version optimized to avoid iGEM RE sites, as well as an attempt to optimize for primer design.  The edits were first done on PCquad Optimized for pET22b.   Several changes were made in at the beginning and end of the protein cage sequence.  NCBI blast was used to verify that the amino acid sequence was the same as the original PCquad.   The new file to be used for our protein cage is “PCquad Optimized 2.0”
Notes on the primers for incorporation into pET22b. Forward:  TCAGaccatATGCCGTTcATTACCGTAGGAC Tm = 62.8 degrees for entire primer, Tm = 56.7 degrees for overlap with gene Hairpin with dG = -2.66 kcal/mol Self-dimer:  dG = -7.82kcal/mol due to NdeI site Reverse:  TTGACAGTctcgagCTGACGATGGCTTCTATGCTGAG Tm = 65.9 degrees for entire primer, Tm = 52.6 degrees for overlap with gene Hairpin: one with dG = -2.32 kcal/mol Self-dimer:  Highest at -9.96 kcal/mol due to XhoI site, several others between -4 to -6 kcal/mol Heterodimers:  several at about -6kcal/mol

From the data analysis it seems that the bacteria with construct BBa_K515102, when in 10 mM malate perform a very uniform behaviour. This is also confirmed by positive control cells exposed to 10 mM serine, where the response of cells is also highly uniform. Cells with construct PA2652 without exposure to saturating attractant show less uniform movement than PA2652 cells, whether exposed to malate or serine. Also negative control cells fail to show uniformity in their movement suggesting inability to recognise the saturating medium containing 10 mM malate and therefore, performing their movement randomly.
2.2 Qualitative analysis
Qualitative assays were done to observe the effect of rewiring chemotaxis in E. coli with the engineered constructs PA2652 and mcpS ( BBa_K515102 ).
A number of methods exist that show chemotaxis towards a source [2]. Most of them are based on the properties of semi-solid agar, which allows diffusion of molecules and bacterial movement. We have modified an agar plug assay, which involves plating bacteria at opposite end of attractant on a petri-dish, to observe chemotaxis. The bacteria used were in mid-exponential phase (OD600 0.4-0.6). Cells suspended in the semi-solid agar were positioned 2 cm away from the attractant source and left overnight to grow. At the end of the assay the plates were imaged using Fujifilm LAS-3000 Imager.
This assay was done to show the functional chemotaxis of E. coli DH5α transformed with our PA2652 construct ( BBa_K515102 ) compared to the inability of control E. coli DH5α to do the same. Positive control cells were exposed to increasing concentrations of serine, which is recognised by the endogenous chemoreceptors of E. coli, to observe what the movement we are looking for in cells with our construct. We have also tested cells containing the non-codon optimised mcpS gene for qualitative analysis.
Results from this assay should show clear differences in the shape of colonies formed. Bacteria attracted to the source move and distort the colony into an elliptical, directed shape towards the source. We expect the control colonies to look circular because bacteria are equally likely to swim into any direction.

Figure 5 - Blood-Brain Barrier.
Finally, MeHg can be either excreted into bile as urine, representing respectively 90% and 10% of excretion pathways MeHg its half-life in blood is around 40-50 days, while the half-life considering the body as a whole is around 70-80 days. However, regarding the excretion through the bile duct, it is much less developed in infants due to its immaturity of the gut enterocytes, reabsorption of what was occurring secreted into bile.
Physio-pathology and clinical signals
The ability to cross the blood-brain barrier is the main feature which makes MeHg dangerously toxic. Their actions in the CNS are due to their ability to form sulfo-metal bonds with sulfhydryl groups of certain groups of cytoskeletal proteins in nerve cells, such as tubulin, affecting the normal formation of the central nervous system due to changes in capabilities division and migration of such cells, even MeHg is also toxic to the subject to its CNS. This fact explains why many studies prove that MeHg is more toxic during the prenatal period and during childhood, and is considered a powerful teratogenic agent.
Figure 6 – MeHg, a powerful teratogenic agent.
Figure 7 - Microtubules Structure.
Figure 8 - Neuron with its cells and associated structures.
The damage and cell loss, both as neurons of glia cells, due to the toxic effect of MeHg are represented macroscopically with loss of cortical areas of the CNS, both the telencephalon cerebellum as leading to disastrous consequences depending on the region that was affected. Besides the adverse effect on the CNS are also neurotoxic effects noted in the region of spinal ganglia, with a special preference for the dorsal column sensory ganglia.
Figure 9 - Specimen with diffuse brain lesions and atrophy process characteristics of mercury poisoning.
Poisoning can be divided into: acute or chronic high-dose or chronic low doses of MeHg exposure exhibitions. The cases of exposure to high doses are known primarily related to two fated incidents involving intoxication by mass MeHg as the aforementioned case of Minamata Bay, Japan period 1953-1956, and in the rural environment of the early Iraq 1970s the consequences derived from contact with excessive amounts of MeHg, especially of neurological character, were observed steeper when there was exposure during the prenatal"

We treated and we think we are done. Then we come, so let’s go do impact survey. The medication we gave, what is it happening? Then we come and we find [that] there are maybe 30 TF per village and you see no reason. So you use the same guidelines whether you have treated or not. Because you wait for two years before you do the impact surveys [...].
Daniel C.:
So what are you doing at the moment programme-wise?
George:
[...] Here in Chikwawa, we want to give another mass drug administration. So what we are doing [...] [here], if you see those motorcycles, those are senior agencies. They call themselves disease control surveillance officers. [...] They are the ones who bring information to us. So today we are verifying to say: is the registration going on well? Have you giving us correct figures? When we have that, next week we will see how much medication we will need.
Daniel C.:
So let’s say now is 2019 and every region is under the threshold, what are your next steps? What does BICO have to do to make sure that trachoma won’t return? Do you have any plans?
George:
Yes. Currently, my role that they have given me as George is to make sure that I collect all the data that have ever been there for trachoma. Because the GTMP came when the data has already been collected. So my role is to make sure that I collect all the data from everywhere, all resources. Others are in hard copy, I have to put them in soft copy [until] I have every data. [...] Then I make a team that has a network. I could net Chikwawa clinicians, Sandama clinicians, Zomba clinicians. All the clinicians should be connected in a certain network. When they identify any case, these clinicians can easily tell this step and this step can easily notify. So in my case I will take guys that are not fireable. So any case would be very important then we follow that case. So that what we are trying to do so that we can say that we have it eliminated. Any place where trachoma is showing, we will intervene. So it will not mean that we will have reached elimination and we will stop. But otherwise it is that of surveillance where we see Oh these [...] people [...] have trachoma! We intervene. When one comes and says: Oh"

Short Summary
The main idea of iGEM is an easy way of biological engineering realized by standard biological parts (BioBricks) and an open source database. These make synthetic biology accessible to everyone. The whole concept of BioBricks is based on sharing parts freely across the community. The community connects different iGEM teams to help each other, learn from each other and finally to achieve their desired goals. The collaboration of individual teams is one of the most important aspects in iGEM. For our iGEM project we worked with several other iGEM teams. We collaborated extensively with the iGEM team UNIFI 2017 and CU Boulder 2017 . Team UNIFI participates for the first time in the iGEM competition and our aim was to help them getting jump started into the iGEM competition and coaching them in order to direct them towards a successful project. iGEM UNIFI helped us with the characterization of the transporter ptNTT2, using their more precise equipment to recording growth rates. Next to this collaboration we sent plasmids from former iGEM Bielefeld-CeBiTec"

Characterisation of the enzyme
Figure 3: Reaction mechanism of EreB hydrolyzing the model ester p-NPB into a chromogenic product
To characterize the enzyme we performed a spectrophotometric assay using the model ester p-nitrophenyl-butyrate (p-NPB) as a substrate for EreB. The chromogenic product p-Nitrophenyl shows characteristic absorbance at 405 nm. The reaction takes place even faster than hydrolysis of erythromycin since p-NPB is already highly activated and therefore readily hydrolyzed. This is also the reason why it degrades quite rapidly by itself so reactions have to be measured soon after being set up and taking a negative control is especially important.
Kinetics
Figure 4: 96-well plate showing the substrate serial dilution incubated with EreB (1-4) and as negative control with water (0)
To determine the kinetic parameters of EreB we prepared a 100 µl serial dilution of the substrate, starting with 1.2 mM p-NPB (in 0.4% Triton, 50 mM buffer Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 0.2 M NaCl) to which 100 µl of the enzyme (11 µM) were added. The experiment was performed in quadruplets and the mean value was then plotted (see figure 5) against substrate concentrations.
Figure 5: Reaction of EreB with a serial dilution of p-NPB (left) and negative control without the enzyme (right)
Result:  The higher the substrate concentration the faster the substrate is hydrolyzed, which can be seen in an increasing gradient and is self-evident as the enzyme encounters the substrate more often and faster the higher its concentration is in the solution. This data was also used for an exact determination of the kinetic parameters in our modelling section . At these reaction conditions (pH 7.5) almost no decomposition of p-NPB takes place which is confirmed in the following experiment.
PH optimum
We prepared a buffer series from pH 4.5 to pH 10 using Sodium acetate + acetic acid (pH 4, 4.5, 5), MES (pH 5.5, 6), HEPES (6.5, 7), Tris-HCl (7.5, 8"

Did not solidify and was disposed before incubation
Liquid culture test
As compared to the control, + phage is much more clear
2. Spot test results
This is similar to what we saw before finals. This confirms that our phage dilution series have survived. Hurray!
3. Titer test result
-5 and -6 will be a good place to start our selection test. We will also need to increase phage titer (phage concentration).
4. Liquid culture test (4.27 6:00pm)
Obvious clearage is seen in + phage test tube. E coli debris was also observed at the bottom of the + phage test tube.
VI) Conclusion
T7+ have survived for a week. We can continue to use the 4.8 dilution series for our experiments. This will save us some stock phage.
-5 is a good phage concentration to start our selection test.
The stock phage solution has a medium titer, we need to increase it to perform our mutation experiments.
VI) Proposed next step
Perform selection test with -5 phage.
Increase titer of stock phage for mutation experiments.

Preparation
Buffer Solution for Spores Recovery
Items to be Prepared
*0.05M MgCl2 stock solution *0.1M Potassium Phosphate stock solution
0.05M MgCl2 Stock Solution
MW * Desired Volume (L) * Desired Molarity (M)
203.3 * 0.25L * 0.05M = 25.413g
Therefore, 25.413g of MgCl2 is mixed with 0.25L of DI water to make 0.25L of 0.05M MgCl2.
0.1M Potassium Phosphate Stock Solution
MW * Desired Volume (L) * Desired Molarity (M)
174.18 * 0.25L * 0.1M = 4.355g
Therefore, 4.355g of Potassium Phosphate is mixed with 0.25L of DI water to make 0.25L of 0.1M Potassium Phosphate.
The stock solutions are to be sent for autoclaving before use.
After the stock solutions have been autoclaved, we prepared the buffer solution for the recovery of the spores. As not much of the buffer solution is required, we decided to make 100ml of it.
The final concentration of each component as seen in the protocol for Method A should be:
0.01M Potassium Phosphate
0.05M KCl
0.001MgCl2
Therefore,
Emr Stock Solution for Addition to Agar Plates
Emr Stock Solution
50mg of Em in 50ml of DI water
Amount of Emr Stock Solution to be Added
Required amount of Emr = 1ug/ml Stock solution of Emr = 1mg/ml
Therefore,
1mg / 1ug = 1000 The stock solution needs to be diluted 1000 times to obtain the correct concentration of 1ug/ml.
500ml of LB + Kan + Emr is to be poured, therefore:
500ml / 1000 = 0.5ml
0.5ml of Emr is to be added to 500ml of LB + agarose solution.

save a little of your inoculation before miniprepping. This way, you’ll be able to grow up more of the DNA that you have after it has been sequenced and verified
We should always use controls in our experiments
For example,  double digests, we can run one enzyme in each lane, no enzyme in one lane, and both enzymes in another
More importantly, when running transformations, always run positive and negative controls
CONTROLS FOR GATEWAY:
Use the aequorin because we know that it has worked with aequorin.  IF all of the aequorin plates work when running the gateway and transformations of PCZ and aequorin together, and the PCZ plates don’t, then we know that we have to work on the pENTR-dTOPO-PCZ-mODC
Plate controls (transform w/ pUC19 and water)
We need to start up again using a new colony containing pENTR-dTOPO-PCZ-mODC, make a glycerol stock, miniprep, etc.
In addition, we can also be retransforming using the DNA that we already isolated and then growing up cells
We had 2 different stocks of the MDS, we should call scarab genomics and complain to tell them that we followed their protocol and did it with HB101 on the side and had success with HB101 and no with the MDS.  See if we can get the money back.

Guelph,2008,Team:Guelph#Results_-_-_TEXT.html,"500. It is difficult to extrapolate accurately how many microbes might exist in the plant, know whether these are dispersed survivors from the injection or recent generations, but at the very least this suggests the microbial population we injected spread systematically and are stabily transcribing a transgene on a plasmid inside this plant for a significant period of time.
We observed similar result in Arabidopsis thaliana, which may indicate this would be a useful transgene delivery tool for Arabidopsis research.
RNAi constructs against TB1 and GFP were successfully made and tested by PCR for successful electroporation into Kp342. The 750 bp TB1 construct (two 250 bp TB1 fragments oriented sense and antisense around the central 100 bp Zea mays Actin1 intron) was cut with NdeI and PstI and ligated into the NdeI and PstI cut pDSK-GFPuv, trading places with the plasmid's GFP. For the GFP RNAi construct, the 1000 bp biobrick from BBa_E0240 was used, which is a composite part containing rbs and terminators. Here the PSBA promoter was introduced infront of the construct in the pSB1A2 plasmid, and the Eco/Pst casssette then removed and inserted into the pDK-GFPuv plasmid.
The TB1 RNAi construct was successfully electroporated into Klebsiella pneumonii 342 using common electroporation protocols for E. coli which was verified by colony PCR. This RNAi signal producing endophyte was then injected into corn plants to acertain it potential to silence a plant gene inhibiting branch formation. These plants were grown alongside tb1 mutant corn, and GFP tagged kp342 for two weeks, at which time they were to be injected again.
At this time the plants have still not reached a stage where phenotypes appear to be visible - see the below photo which was taken 2 weeks post injection. :-( Also, the GFP RNAi construct in pDSK-GFPuv while maintained in E. coli, was not successfully introduced into kp342 despite three attempts, so the trial on GFP silencing proceeded with E. coli instead. Work and monitoring will continue up until and after the jamboree - BIGS will not be silenced!!!

Newcastle,2009,Team:Newcastle#SporulationTuning#Introduction_-_-_TEXT.html," of transcription facts, known as Spo0A.[3] Spo0A is activated by phosphorylation on an aspartyl residue located in the N-terminal portion of the protein.[3]
Unlike other response regulators, Spo0A is indirectly phosphorylated by a multicomponent phosphorelay involving at least three kinases called kinA, kinB, and kinC, which phosphorylate Spo0F, and the resulting Spo0F~P, in turn, transfers the phosphoryl group to Spo0B. Finally, Spo0B~P transfers the phosphoryl group to, and thereby activates, Spo0A.[3] As such, the phophoryl groups are drained from the relay by the action of dedicated phosphotases that dephosphorylate Spo0F~P and Spo0A~P.[1][3]
Spo0A is also subjected to control at the levels of its synthesis and activity by a positive feedback loop in which the response regulator stimulates the synthesis of the RNA polymerase σ factor σH, which, in turn stimulates transcription of the gene for Spo0A, as well as the genes for the phosphorelay components KinA and Spo0F.[2]
It is important to note that activating Spo0A via the phosphorelay is essential as it is responsible for allowing Spo0A to accumulate in a gradual manner, and this slow accumulation plays a critical role in the ability of the regulatory protein to trigger sporulation.[3] Experiments have also been carried out and results have shown that the activated form of Spo0A failed to trigger sporulation during growth as it had bypassed phosphorylation, and only a small proportion of cells progressed to the early stage of sporulation.[3]
Sporulation
From our research, we found that phosphatases may be viewed as negative regulators that provide access for negative signals to influence the cell’s decision whether to sporulate or to continue vegetative growth.[4] The phosphotases that dephosphorylates Spo0A, preventing its activation are Spo0E[1], YisI, and YnzD.[5] Therefore, in order to ensure that sporulation occurs under the appropriate conditions, the phosphorelay must integrate the competition between signal input provided by the kinases and signal cancellation carried out by the phosphatises, which determines the decision to sporulate or not,[4][5] by governing flux through the relay and hence the level of Spo0A~P, which must reach a threshold concentration to trigger sporulation.[1][3]
Also, the Spo0F lacks an output domain"

SupBiotech-Paris,2009,Team:SupBiotech-Paris#Modeling du traitement_-_-_TEXT.html,"Le déplacement ‘’’en X ‘’’ dépend, uniquement de la ‘’’propagation des phages ’’’ dans le vaisseau grâce au débit sanguin. En effet, on néglige la diffusion qui a lieu également selon l'axe X car elle est 1000 fois inférieure à la propagation des particules dans le sang (liée à l'importance du flux sanguin). Les vecteurs cellulaires se déplacent à différentes ‘’’vitesses réparties de façon parabolique’’’ allant de, Vmax au centre du vaisseau, à V0 contre la paroi du vaisseau.
Les vitesses des phages phages diminuent en se rapprochant des parois du vaisseau à cause des forces de frottements qui s'opposent au mouvement.
On peut donc déterminer en combien de temps la particule ayant une vitesse Vmax, c'est-à-dire la particule au centre du vaisseau, en atteint l'extrémité. On obtient ainsi le temps nécessaire à l’internalisation de tous les phages d’une bactérie .
Haut de page
La diffusion à travers les parois des vaisseaux sanguins
Le déplacement en Y représente la diffusion du phage dans le sang (j(n)). Il dépend de l'équation de la diffusion d'une particule (n) dans un fluide (Loi de Fick).
Avec n, le nombre de particules ( phages ), grad n, la différence de concentration et D, le coefficient de diffusion.
La diffusion des vecteurs cellulaires à l’intérieur du vaisseau sanguin puis à travers la paroi est un phénomène de diffusion avec sortie. Par conséquent, il y aura toujours un fort gradient de concentration du phage dans le sang. On peut donc dire que le gradient est constant (et égal à 1) au cours du temps. Ainsi la vitesse de diffusion (j(n)) est égale à D.

TU-Delft,2011,Team:TU-Delft#Project#Detailed_-_-_TEXT.html," of cells located in the foot. (Pujol, 1967) There are three specific regions in the foot where the different cell types are clustered together; namely the phenol gland, the collagen gland and the enzyme gland. (Tamarin) The phenol gland produces proteins for the protective varnish and for the plaque. The produced proteins are stored in membrane-bound granules, which are homogeneous, dense, spherical bodies. After the formation of the granules, they are transported to the secretion area.
The attachment to a surface in steps
If the mussel identified a suitable surface, this surface will be inspected by the tip of the mussel foot. After this inspection, the foot will sweep the surface to clean it. This cleaning is probably done to remove all the unbound matter. After the cleaning the foot become motionless for 2-5 minutes, in this time the formation of byssus thread takes place. This means that first the ventral groove contracts to squeeze out all the seawater. The groove is then filled again by the already produced granules, containing the proteins and all the components for the formation of the byssal threads and the plaques.
If this procedure it disturbed within 1 minute, the mussel will detach, leaving behind a plaque which is attached to unfinished thread. (Maheo, 1970) This suggests that the characteristic time for plaque formation is less than a minute.  This immediately raises the following question: how is it possible that the content of the granules from the enzyme gland mix fast enough with the proteins released by the phenolic gland? This implies that the cross-linking must be very effective, within a minute, since this is the time the mussel needs for formation of the plaques.  (Haemers, 2003)
One should also keep in mind the environmental and other biological influences; both environmental factors (salinity, temperature, pH, season, and substratum choice) and biological factors (age and metabolic state of the organism) also affect the efficiency and strength of byssal attachment to surfaces (Van Winkle 1970 ; Crisp et al. 1985; Carrington 2002).
The mussle foot proteins (mfps)
There are at least five different mussel foot proteins identified in the foot of the mussel, the proteins are present in varying amount. The amount present depends on the “specialisation” of the protein (coating or attachment for example), which is directly linked to the DOPA content and the presence of their additional characteristic residues.

Qualitative data from debriefs after the event:
“The girls absolutely loved it! The parents were happy with the event as well. The only item of concern was to make sure we plan this event on a day when there isn’t a lot going on at the same time. We had a few parents lost after the event was completed because there were so many people in the area (we can tweak the dismissal part of the event). All in all it seems we would love to have this event again!”
-Jacqueline Brooks, our collaborator from GSCC.
Feedback from student volunteers about what worked well:
“From my perspective, the Girl Scouts outreach event was a success. The girls seemed to enjoy it and learn a lot. The candy DNA was definitely a positive inclusion as a pick-me-up in the middle of the event. The strawberry DNA extraction was great too - it was easy to follow and worked like a charm.”
“The more hands-on the activity, the better. [The girls] really liked the gel electrophoresis, Twizzler DNA, and plate streak. Anything colorful or sciencey seemed preferred over the more abstract activities.”
Feedback from the student volunteers for how to improve the event in the future:
“I was confused by the Lego activity since it’s supposed to be an abstract parallel to standard gene components and when the girls had to build a gene out of the lego bricks, it became a little bit boring and made the girls get lost if one didn’t have a good understanding of how genetics works but just followed the instructions to put different colored brick together...

I have tested TTEC using our small RNA endogenous terminator,spot42 scaffold.
*Can this tool help your team?
We calculated spot42 scaffold terminator efficiency using algorithm1 (90%,medium?),which meets our explanation on some unexpected experimental results.
Some evidence suggests the terminator is not very strong: when induces Spot42 in the upstream of GFP_Generator with very high aTc concentration, the GFP level soared to a very high level(even higher than GFP_generator alone), made it elusive on this paradox.

*How does it help you?
It shed some light on the unexpected result theoretically.
*If you have any suggestion(such as interface or the tool),  please feel free to tell us.
1/I'm wondering if there is any chance that you could present easy-to-understand guidiance on the homepage? And it will be better to make comparsions to other similar tools.
2/The efficiency label of algorithm2 or 3 doesn't work well on chrome.

Fig. 5: Fluorescence of wild type spores and B53-Sporobeads (containing the PcotYZ-cotZ-gfp-terminator construct)
Because of the low but distinct fluorescence of wild type spores, we measured and compared the fluorescence intensity of 100 spores per construct (see data ). We obtained significant differences between wild type spores and all of our Sporobeads (see data ). The intensity bar charts in Fig. 6 show the fluorescence intensity, while the 3D graphs illustrate the distribution of fluorescence intensity across the spore surface. This correlates with the localization of our fusion proteins in the crust. For image analysis we measured the fluorescence intensity of an area of 750 pixel per spore by using ImageJ and evaluated the results with the statistical software R.  The following graph (Fig. 6) shows the results of microscopy and ImageJ analysis of the strongest construct integrated into wildtype W168 (B53) and the deletion strain B 49 (B70).
Fig. 6: Result of fluorescence evaluation of the three strains W168, B53 and B70.
As shown in Fig. 6, the wild type spore has hardly any fluorescence, whereas both Sporobeads with the integrated construct  pSBBs1C-PcotYZ-cotZ-2aa-gfp-terminator give a distinct fluorescence signal around the edge of the spore. Furthermore, it demonstrates that strain B 70 has the highest fluorescence intensity. For more detailed information look at our Data page
In summary we successfully developed functional sporobeads that are capable of displaying any protein of choice on the surface of modified B. subtilis endospores.

The tested cultures were incubated at different concentrations of arabinose (0%, 0.002%, 0.02%, 0.2%, 20%, m/V). We put 150μL (OD=0.15) liquid culture into a 90mm-diameter plate contained 20mL LB agar medium. One hour later, a piece of 1cm-diameter sterile filter paper was put in the center of each plate. 15μL Ara liquid was put on the center of the paper. Eighteen hours later, the black and white photos were taken under 362nm excitation light, another ten hours later, the colorful photos were taken by a digital camera. It showed that 2%(m/V) Ara had the best result. Each concentration had three biological replicates. And you could have an object image of the fluorescence of GFP under different concentration of Ara.

Assist in Survey of Chewing-Gum & GMOs
Aix-Marseille created an E. coli strain that produced enzymes, which could degrade rubber polymers. Nowadays, chewing gum is the second urban pollutant after cigarette butts. To clean chewing gum, specific machines are used. Because of heaviness and expensiveness, Aix-Marseille started their project.
They wanted to collect information about chewing-gum and GMOs worldwide. We were glad to help them to collect it. At first, we translated their questionnaire from English into Chinese carefully and checked it twice by two members of our team. Then, we went to Zhongshan Road and Taidong Business District away from our lab to interview the passersby one by one and randomly picked. The interviewees completed the questionnaire by themselves. At last, the results were submitted by us.
Because of our work, Aix- Marseille gave us a Gold Collaboration Badge, the highest level of honor. Here it is!

Effluent water monitoring for sewage treatment and other industrial processes.
Quality control monitoring in manufacturing processes
Water quality monitoring for drinking water contaminants
Pipeline monitoring for oil spills
Conclusions
From our marketing plan we have demonstrated a customer base that has shown interest in our product. We will target oil and gas service companies which are involved in monitoring toxins in this field.  Additionally, we aim to market our product to private companies and major analytical laboratories in this industry.  While competing technologies exist in our market, our product provides clear advantages in terms of our potential efficiency, reliability, portability, and cost.  This technology fits a potential $50 million marketing opprotunity with the ability to translate easily into other markets and provide a dynamic product line.

Cambridge,2012,Team:Cambridge#SD#DesignProcess_-_-_TEXT.html," situations has been made difficult by the unpredictable and non-quantified outputs of existing solutions, as well as a lack of appropriate storage, distribution and utilization systems. This leaves a large gap between a simple, functional sensing mechanism and a fully realised product that can be used in the field.
We aim to bridge this gap at all points by developing a standardised ratiometric luciferase output in a Bacillus chassis. This output can be linked up with prototyped instrumentation and software for obtaining reliable quantified results. Additionally, we have reduced the specialized requirements for the storage and distribution of our bacteria by using Bacillus' sporulation system. To improve the performance of our biosensing platform we have genetically modified Bacillus’ germination speed. Lastly, we demonstrated the robustness of our system by testing it with a new fluoride riboswitch, providing the opportunity to tackle real life problems.

Soon, we came together at a sunny summer day to discuss and develop ideas for our presentation. After a short time, a great idea came up: To make our presentation Pokémon-themed! Almost everyone at least heard of Pokémon’s mascot Pikachu once in their lives. We felt, that through this, we could achieve the attention and awareness of even more people.
In a very short amount of time, we collected many ideas and developed a presentation in the style of a Pokémon fight; we even re-wrote the lyrics of the original Pokémon theme song to fit our project.        Soon, the details were improved and we visualized the fight between „OPTOPTOSIS“ and the „Tumor“ in the classic, oldschool manner as one knows it back from the times of the GameBoy.
Then the evening of the Science Slam came, many people came to the show and voted for us, so we reached the fourth place in the competition.
Even if we did not reach the first place, we had the feeling that we could introduce our vision and project, as well as the iGEM competition itself to many people in an entertaining way.         We are sure that we left a lasting impression.
Gonna watch them all!
Jülich Biotechday
On the 30th of September, the “Forschungszentrum Jülich” hosted the “Jülich Biotechday 2016”. Four of our members attended this event.
We visited many interesting presentations, some of the speeches in the lecture hall were about the „Development of platform technologies which facilitate construction of microbial cell factories for production of biofuels and chemicals“, “Industrial strain improvement for boosting food functionality“ or even “The plant microbiome: ecology and functioning and how plants can benefit“.
It was a nice and interesting event because we got to know the current state of research. Plus, we had a discussion with Prof. Dr. Akihiko Kondo from the university of Kobe about iGEM. Among other things, he told us about some new interesting features of the crispr-cas9 system.
During lunch break we established contacts with company representatives and got valuable information about some of the newest products.
We are looking forward to attending the next Biotechday in 2017, as well as the 40th anniversary of the Forschungszentrum Jülich.

The time scale of the model might be to large, because it’s not possible to define units to the different parameters.
In the program defining time steps as seconds, minutes and so on, is not possible this problem also involves defining concentrations of the enzymes.
Some of the initial reaction rate constants and enzyme concentrations was from articles, and afterwards optimized for this model [ 3 ].
Focusing on the behaviour of TAR/TARm in the model (Figure 5), it demonstrates that the concentration of methylated TAR rises if no phosphorylated CheB is present in the system.
When the concentration of phosphorylated CheB rises the concentration of methylated TAR drops.
This corresponded well with the known theory for the real system.
Figure 5: graph showing the concentration of phosphorylated CheB affecting the concentration of methylated TAR, making them drop.
Focusing on the CheA/CheAp behaviour in the model (The top graph in figure 6), it demonstrates that the CheA auto-phophorylation rate rises when no TAR is methylated, thus producing phosphorylated CheA.
The dephosphorylation of CheA, is performed by both CheB and CheY (the bottom graph in figure 6), rise as the concentrations of both phosphorylated CheB and CheY rise and thereby decreases the concentration of phosphorylated CheA.
This corresponded well with the known theory for the real system.
Figure 6: The top graph is showing the concentration of phosphorylated CheA rising when the concentration of methylated TSR drops. The bottom graph is showing the concentrations of CheB and CheY rising when the concentration of phosphorylated CheA rises.
Focusing on the CheB/CheBp behaviour in the model which illustrate that concentrations of phosphorylated CheB rises when phosphorylated CheA is present, as seen in figure 6 and its dephosphorylation occurs during the demethylation of TAR as seen in figure 5.
This corresponded well with the known theory for the real system.
Focusing on the CheY/CheYp (Figure 6) and the flagella motor rotational direction the model illustrates that when concentrations of phosphorylated CheA rises, the concentrations of phosphorylated CheY rises and the flagellar activates clockwise rotation.
The concentration of phosphylated CheY is proportional to the flagella motor rotational direction, because phosphylated CheY activates Clockwise rotation in the flagellar motors which without phosphylated CheY turns Counter Clockwise.

As is shown in the graph, this system can be reasonably considered as a TCS. The amount of NtrC-Pi (Conc) and NtrB-Pi (Conb) are two key parameters of this system. Four factors influence Conc and Conb: NtrB helps NtrC’s phosphorylation, NtrC starts the production of NtrB, Conb reduction caused by PII and constant NtrC production. Also, it should not be neglected that the inherent degradation of NtrC and Ntrb is in proportion to their own concentration.
Thus, the evolution equation of this system can be written as:
Where y0 can be expressed as:
The four parameters b, c, y0, x0 invited here respectively represent the velocity of the four processes mentioned before. To be emphasized,y0 describing the change of Conb caused by PII. Parameters a, d is the coefficient of proportionality between Conc or Conb and its depredating velocity. This is a differential equation and the evolution process could be treated as a Markov Process*.
Here we apply methods from dynamic system to conduct further analysis:
First, Consider evolution matrix A, calculate the eigenvalue λ of A
Solve this equation, get
and the eigenvector is
Since parameters a, d are relatively small compared with c, b and they are both negative, it can be easily spotted thatλ1>0,λ2<0 and the ordinate of the vector I1>0 while that of I2<0. If we temporarily put aside the parameters x0, y0 and the definition domain of Conc and Conb, this system could be explained and predicted by the phase flow graph shows below.
Every curve in the graph is an orbit of the system with different initial Conc and Conb. This means that the system with certain initial condition evolves alongside the curve that passes through that point. Thus, with any certain set of parameters, we can determine how the system evolves according to the graph.
So how to draw this graph? How to calculate the function of the curves in the graph? If we consider a system with the evolving law written as
Rewrite r(t) using the eigenvector I1, I2, defined vector X=(Conc, Conb)
Take this back into the differential equation, after simplify, get

Some values had a significant difference (20 ng/ul difference) while others were pretty close (0.1 ng/ul difference).  Therefore, no real conclusion can be made on this matter until more samples are compared.
Later this afternoon, the new ligase enzyme, Quick Ligase from NEB arrived.  I did one sample of BFP+terminator using the Quick Ligase and then transformed it.  The plates will sit out over the weekend and will be checked on Monday.
WEEK 6: 7/11-7/15/2011
7/11:  The transformation plates using the Quick Ligase mixtures did not grow anything.  Thus Traci, Vanessa, and I took a trip over to MIT to take with a Post-Doc of our collaborators in the Weiss Lab about our ligation problems.  While their we discussed the possibility that our problems may lie in transformation of the ligation reactions, rather than the ligation reactions themselves.  Since we are using our own homemade competent cells, their ability to take up ligated DNA vector, which is not super-coiled, is significantly decreased.  Therefore, we borrowed some of the commercial cells that the MIT lab uses.
With these new competent cells, we did transformations of our ligation products.  We used a slightly different transformation protocol, recovering the heat shocked cells in 1 ml of LB broth in the 37 C, 300rpm shaker.  I noticed that the concentration of cells in the MIT batch was much greater than our tubes of cells.  In addition to the competency of our cells, this lack of cell concentration in our sample tubes could also be contributing to our unsuccessful transformations.
7/12: The transformations using our cells did not grow, however the transformations with the commercial cells from MIT saw some growth.  The two samples that grew were BFP+term and YFPc+R2000 (constitutive promoter).  As noted yesterday, the concentration of our cells per sample tube was much lower than the commercial cells when pelleted.  So today we concentrated our cells, using beginning volumes of 800 ul, 1200 ul, 1600 ul, and 2000 ul and they were concentrated into 200 ul volume.  We used ligation reactions that we had in the freezer.
Also I ran one of my gel extractions that had a very low concentration (1.8 ng/ ul) on a gel to see if anything would show up, as another possible reason for unsuccessful ligation is the quality and amount of DNA from the gel"

Lysis buffer had the following composition:
150 mM NaCl
50 mM Tris-HCl
5 mM EDTA
1% Triton X-100

We used the following protocol for lysis:
Spin down 3 ml of cells into a pellet, discarding the LB supernatant.
Resuspend cells in 1.5 ml of ice cold lysis buffer, take 200 ul of this into a new tube and add 800 ul of cold lysis buffer.
Sonicate at power level 2 in two sets of five bursts (each about one second long).  Be sure to wait 10 seconds in between sets and keep tube on ice to prevent overheating.
Spin down at maximum speed for 5 minutes at 4 degrees.
Take supernatant into a new tube.  This is the final protein lysis mixture.
Note!  In the future, we should only spin down 200 ul of cells for lysis.  According to Alain, most of the time they even just use 100 ul and directly boil it with SDS.  May try this protocol tomorrow if current protocol doesn't work (the downside is that we have to start again from the culture stage and not the protein stage).

For loading duplicates, load 9 ul of 5x sample buffer with 36 ul of protein for a total of 45 ul.

Characterization of our prototype
Figure. The characterisation result of the prototype of the Tristable Switch. This result was obtained by combining 3 characterization data obtained in 3 different days. Error bars represent SEM from 3 biological replicates.
The results showed that the Tristable Switch could neither produce steady output nor possess sensitive state-changing ability as we expected. Three different inducers, aTc, DAPG and IPTG were added to induce one of the three promoters every two hours in order to test its capacity to switch after induction. Unfortunately, the construct did not exhibit these characteristics while green fluorescence proteins keeping on dominating throughout the whole experiment. According to the data obtained, both the levels of red fluorescence protein and blue fluorescence protein were significantly lower than that of green fluorescence protein without responding to its specific inducers.
We therefore conjectured that this might be due to the imbalance promoter strength among the three promoters and the insufficient induction time. Mutations could be excluded since sequencing of the circuit was done and proved to be correct.
1. Three different repressible promoters, tetp, phlFp and lacpwere used to build the circuit. lacp were the strongest one among the three according to the paper, Genomic mining of prokaryotic repressors for orthogonal logic gates. Since GFP was driven by lacp and the GFP level remained nearly the same throughout the whole experiment, it suggested that the promoter strength of lacp was too strong that the other two promoters were continuously inhibited by the repressors that were driven by the lacp.
2. The induction time after adding inducers might not be enough. If time was not enough, it would be hard to produce the fluorescence proteins to a particular level. Usually, the induction time would take around 6 hours which is triple compared to ours (Cameron, 2014). If there was not enough time for the circuit to produce sufficient amount of fluorescence proteins, it would be hard to measure the fluorescence accurately. Aside from this, some repressor proteins would remain, thus, hamper the activation of another repressible promoter.
Improvments

In contrast, if 5-FOA (5-Fluoroorotic acid) is added to the media, the active ODCase will convert 5-FOA into the toxic compound (a suicide inhibitor) 5-fluorouracil causing cell death, which allows for selection against yeast carrying the gene.
Since URA3 allows for both positive and negative selection, it has been developed as a genetic marker for DNA transformations and other genetic techniques in bacteria and many fungal species. It is one of the most important genetic markers in yeast genetic modification. While URA3 is a powerful selectable marker it has a high background. This background is because cells that pick up mutations in URA3 may also grow on 5-FOA. Colonies should be verified by a second assay such as PCR to confirm the desired strain has been created.
Characterization
Positive selection
For characterizing the positive selecting function of URA3 part, we designed the following experiment:
1. Incubate 2 test tubes of yeasts-BY4741, and numbered as #1, #2. (cultured in YPD, 30℃,6 months)
2. After incubation, the yeasts in #1 tube are transformed by PRS416 plasmid, which contains URA3 gene as report gene.
3. Two groups of yeasts are spread on two Sc-URA plates, and hatch in the 30℃ incubator for 48 hr.
4. Examine the growth situation of yeasts on both plates.
Fig.3 The plasmid profile for PRS416
Fig.4 The result of our experiment to characterize the URA3 gene for positive selection
Showed in the photograph above, yeasts in group 1#, with PRS416 plasmid, has proliferated on the Sc-URA plate. Meanwhile, the other group without URA3 gene are not able to grow on the Sc-URA plate. The result indicates the URA3 gene is necessary for our yeasts (BY4741) to grow and proliferate on media not supplemented with uracil, thereby allowing selection for yeast carrying the gene.
negative selection
In order to characterize the negative selecting function of URA3 gene, after the transformation of #1 yeasts, we also spread the yeasts of group 1 on a 5-FOA plate, and spread group "

Surface display system
Background
The anchoring of proteins to the cell surface of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) using genetic techniques is an exciting and emerging research area that holds great promise for a wide variety of biotechnological applications, including vaccine development, whole cell catalysis, bioremediation and etc. In iGEM, the 2015 Concordia University-Canada team tried but failed to develop a protein scaffold surface display system. Development of a surface display system in L. lactis will make it a better chassis in synthetic biology.
To build a surface display system, the first thing should be considered is the cell wall anchoring motif. The most exploited anchoring regions are those with the LPXTG motifs that bind the proteins in a covalent way to the cell wall. However, to achieve versatile application, it is better to use anchoring domains that interact with the cell wall in a non-covalent way. The major autolysin of L. lactis, the cell wall hydrolase AcmA contains 3 tandem arranged LysM motifs and separated by stretches of 21 to 31 amino acids, this region is collectively termed as the cA anchoring domain. The cA domain can be fused to the N- and C- terminus of functional proteins, and can bind proteins to the cell walls of a broad range of gram-positive bacteria. Interaction of the cA anchoring domain with the cell wall is less strong than that of the LPXTG type cell wall anchoring motif. The interaction between cA and the cell wall is non-covalent. The cA domain could also be used to immobilize soluble enzymes in an active form on the cell surface of L. lactis. Like AcmA, these chimaeric enzymes could bind to L. lactis cells when added from the outside. Thus, cA fusion proteins produced using other expression systems can also be attached to the cell wall of L. lactis.
To get the protein of interest anchored to the surface of L. lactis, it should be secreted out of the cell first. The solution is a signal peptide from the Usp45 protein which is secreted out of L. lactis very efficiently. Fusion of the signal peptide of Usp45 to"
Nevada,2011,Team:Nevada#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," in plants to codons common in E. coli. The newly synthesized intermediate part (BBa_K558003) also contained an E. coli ribosome binding sequence, a His tag sequence on the 3’ end of the coding sequence and an iGEM registry double terminator sequence (BBa_B0014).
The constitutive promoter sigma 70 from the Registry of Standard Biological Parts (BBa_J23101) was classically cloned in front of the synthesized Bay Laurel thioesterase gene to create the Nevada BTE generator part (BBa_K558007). Many tests were used to determine the expression of the Bay Laurel thioesterase including SDS-PAGE, Western blot, colorimetric assay and gas chromatography.  The one assay that was most successful for measuring free fatty acid content in the growth media was purchased through Bioassay Systems (EnzyChrom™ Free Fatty Acid Assay Kit www.bioassaysys.com). T7 Express Iq E. coli with the BTE generator produced up to 125 uM free fatty acid compared to control line which produced 50 uM fatty acid.
Free Fatty Acid Activity
Fatty Acid production was tested using EnzyChrom Free Fatty Acid Assay Kit (BioAssay Systems). The graphs below show the concentration of free fatty acid produced by Bay Laurel Thioesterase transformed in NEB 10 β and NEB Iq cell strains.
The NEB Iq E. coli cell line transformed with the sigma 70-BTE generator produced 125uM free fatty acid compared to the negative control sigma 70-red fluorescent protein (50uM) and the media only control (40uM). Bay Laurel Thioesterase transformed into NEB 10 β cells showed a positive increase of 115uM of fatty acids compared to negative controls of 40uM and 70uM. Based on this data we can produce up to 2.5 fold more free fatty acids with cell lines producing the Bay Laurel Thioesterase then without.
Preliminary tests for fatty acid length showed C-12 in the Bay Laurel Thioesterase transformed cells, but more chromatography test need to be done in order to confirm the production of C-12 and C-14 medium chained fatty acids.

The meaning of life is a philosophical question concerning the significance of life or existence in general.       It can also be expressed in different forms, such as ""Why are we here?"", ""What is life all about?"",      and ""What is the purpose of existence?"" It has been the subject of much philosophical, scientific,      and theological speculation throughout history.

The meaning of life is a philosophical question concerning the significance of life or existence in general.       It can also be expressed in different forms, such as ""Why are we here?"", ""What is life all about?"",      and ""What is the purpose of existence?"" It has been the subject of much philosophical, scientific,      and theological speculation throughout history.       There have been a large number of proposed answers to these questions from many different cultural and ideological backgrounds.      The meaning of life is in the philosophical and religious conceptions of existence, social ties, consciousness, and happiness,      and borders on many other issues, such as symbolic meaning, ontology, value, purpose, ethics, good and evil, free will,      the existence of one or multiple gods, conceptions of God, the soul, and the afterlife.
Scientific contributions focus primarily on describing related empirical facts about the universe,      exploring the context and parameters concerning the 'how' of life.      Science also studies and can provide recommendations for the pursuit of well-being and a related conception of morality.       An alternative, humanistic approach poses the question ""What is the meaning of my life?""      The value of the question pertaining to the purpose of life may coincide with the achievement of ultimate reality, or a feeling of oneness,      or even a feeling of sacredness.

Mercy ships:
In order to find a cheap and effective way of distributing our product, we first spoke to the director of marketing for the charity Mercy Ships (a charity we originally perceived to be a floating hospital that docked at areas where infected people were), Brian Walshe. After speaking to him and discussing our idea we realised this wasn’t going to be an efficient way to distribute our product, as it turned out that in order to keep a barrier between them and infections on land, their ships stay out at sea. This was a minor setback but ultimately a big positive, as talking to him we came across another consideration; could our prevention work and be packaged in such a way that our bacteria could kill Vibrio cholerae and Shigella using RNA interference? This idea eventually led to the idea and development of our spiRNA.
Clinical Microbiologist:
Brian Walshe from Mercy Ships directed us towards looking into infection control, and was able to pass us on to an infection prevention specialist who we presented our project to, along with a consultant in medical microbiology, Rob Porter. They helped us greatly by answering some of our main concerns such as the positive/negative impacts our project could have on communities and whether they would even use something that involves GM bacteria. They were very enthusiastic about our idea and thought it had great potential, saying that the communities we are aiming towards are unlikely to be concerned about GM bacteria, as they wouldn’t have a lot of knowledge on the subject. They also suggested we think about how to contain the bacteria; our answer to this would be to use one of the many killswitch parts available on the iGEM registry of standard parts."

     Furthermore, its use is promoted mainly due to the non-pathogenic nature of this organism. It has been awarded the GRAS (Generally Recognized as Safe) status by the US Food and Drug Administration - FDA. In the opposite, Bacillus subtilis is close enough to other clinically relevant Gram-positive pathogens to be used as an organism relevant to research new targets to antimicrobials and anti-infectives2.
     Bacillus subtilis can easily uptake exogenous DNA, secrete a lot of proteins in the medium, has been used through centuries and is a safe chassis. Can it be better?
Yes, it can.
     We haven’t mentioned before what made us choose Bacillus subtilis as our favorite “pet”-chassis and why you should use it too: the endospores.
     In a suitable growth medium, cells double in length and then divide centrally to produce two identical daughter cells. However, bacteria's life can be stressful and complex, needing to face a lot of adversities and we can use this in our favor. In this situation, like starvation, many bacteria trigger a cellular response involving many genes. In Bacillus subtilis this process entails the activity of more than 500 genes and takes approximately ten hours.9
     The sporulation process starts with an asymmetric division. The biggest part of the cell (called mother) engulfs the smallest (called prespore). When this process is completed, the membrane which surrounds the cytoplasm of the prespore (now called the forespore) gets a very amorphous appearance, probably due to the absence of peptidoglycan layer to define the cell shape. Next, a modified form of cell wall, known as cortex, is synthesized between the forespore membranes, providing it with an oblong shape. Simultaneously, the protein spore coat begins to be deposited on the outside surface of the forespore. The lysis of a mother cell releases the mature spore. The spore is a resistant structure, conceived to resist to environmental adversities like heat, radiation and toxic chemicals, remaining dormant until exposed to mild conditions when it gets germinated. As a commercial product, it’s perfect. Storing and switching the cell on are equally easy, bringing to an open-and-shut product.10
     The primary question is: exposing our cells to a stressful medium will lead them all to form spores? Certainly no. Sporulation is the ultimate bacteria's decision"

As a positive control, instead of using minimal media a solution of 50:50 LB:Washington Production Media (see 2011 iGEM University of Washington Protocols ) was used to represent normal production.  Additionally, we found that the compound formate was predicted to NOT increase hydrocarbons production and this represented a chemical negative control.  All compounds were added to E. coli culture containing the PetroBrick at an OD600 of ~0.05 in the first experiment, and a higher OD600 of 0.400 for the second experiment and grown for 72 hours at 37oC.  Cultures were then sonicated after an OD600 measurement and any produced hydrocarbons were extracted by 1 mL ethyl acetate. This was quantitated based on the peak area of a C15 hydrocarbon product as described in the Decarboxylation section (also see Protocols for relevant procedures).  The tabulated results of the quantitated yields are shown in Figure 6.
Figure 6: Model validation, showing the relative abundance of C15 hydrocarbons of E. coli containing the Petrobrick in combination with different compounds as growth media supplements.  Data is normalized to the positive control (50:50 LB:Washington Production Media) and the relative production of hydrocarbons is displayed relative to optical density measurements.  This data suggests hydrocarbon production can be increased or decreased if the Petrobrick is incubated with specific compounds.  Dashed line represents the average output of hydrocarbons in the positive control. PMFA (Pyruvate, Malate, Fumarate, Aspartic Acid) and G+P (Glycine and Pyruvate).
These hydrocarbon production results indicate there is variability in the output of hydrocarbons from the PetroBrick with different compounds (Figure 6). Interestingly, five of the compounds demonstrated production levels higher than that of the minimal media control, suggesting our model could be used for predicting compounds to increase metabolite production.  Although, AMP and fructose both decreased output despite having the highest predicted increases in hydrcarbon output, suggesting that our model may produce false positives and there is some error in assessing these predictions.  Most excitingly, addition of two compounds, pyruvate and glycine, had increased the relative number of hydrocarbons higher than the complex media of the positive control.  As noted by the"

In all samples, incomplete cell lysis was observed (Figure 3). The lysis may be incomplete due to the shorten incubation time of 45-60 seconds. The blood sample resuspended in 0.15M NaCl also shows turbidity at 600-700nm, despite it being an isotonic solution. The partly cell lysis may be explained by either the pipette tip bursting the cells (mechanical forces) or due to hemolysis of the cells. The blood cells were at the point tested three days old, which may lead to bursting[5]. We can conclude that the antibiotic lyses the red blood cells, but we cannot determine its specificity very accurately.
It was also possible to test lysis of red blood cells using an extract from Brevibacillus parabrevis (Figure 4). Prescence of tyrocidine was confirmed by LC/MS and MALDI-TOF prior to the blood cell analysis. It is of interest to see, if cell extracts alone can be used to screen for cytotoxicity as it is easy to prepare cell extractions.
Figure 4. UV-vis absorption spectra of blood anticoagulated with heparin in presence of unknown concentrations of tyrocidine after 45-60sec of incubation. Nanodrop measurement.
In this experiment, cell lysis is also observed in all samples as with the standard. The control sample should retain blood cell stability, yet it did not. This may be due to the same factors as previously discussed. The data shows that further experiments are required to confirm cell lysis across samples. The high peaks of a few samples might suggest complete cell lysis is due to the presence of antibiotics.
Discussion
The results indicates, despite their uncertainity, that screening of on blood samples can be used as method for screening. Litterature supports lab-on-a-disc screening as having strong potential to be a low-cost, quick, and simple way of detect and screening libraries of NRP antibiotics. For this reason, we have described the basis of a lab-on-disc device.
Concept of lab-on-a-disc

What makes our project a great one is                         not only the project itself, but also the engagement with public issues.
See our story.
Winter Camp
After the Giant Jamboree, team members of BIT-China cannot wait to share their experience                                 of participating in iGEM. With the coming                                 of the cold winter, we came up with an idea to start a winter camp and light the fire.
To promote the concept of synthetic biology, we invited our instructor Prof.                                 Chun Li to give a general introduction about synthetic biology and iGEM competition.                                 Students participated were very eager to ask some questions and share their ideas.                                 Some of them also showed their interest in participating in iGEM next year.
Communication & improvements
In August, 2016, BIT-China was invited to take part in the Asia-Pacific conference held by                                 team NCKU Tainan. About 20 teams participated in the conference, and all of them made splendid                                 speeches to present their own projects, from which we got to know plenty of exciting ideas.
In addition to this, we held and took part in several exchange                                 meetings with other three teams: Peking, Jilin_China , UCAS. Through these exchange meetings,                                 we got many useful suggestions to shape our project step by step.
HP Union
In the Asia-Pacific conference, we shared ideas with other teams.                                 Through this process, we all enlarged our horizons and improved our project greatly.                                 At the same time, we realized the importance of communication,                                 which facilitated the beginning of our HP union.
The main goal was that we could not only communicate with other teams more conveniently but also interacted with and got feedback from public easily.
To achieve our goal, we tried to build a Wechat official account to communicate with other teams and introduce teams’ project to the public.
We led the HP union and started the union with other five teams: BIT, CGU-Taiwan, Jilin_China , Peking, TJU. So far, more teams up to 10 are members of the union.
Communication with COFCO
In the end, we hope that our project can be applied and the target end users are companies focusing on fermentation industry. To get some suggestions for applying our project in industry production,"

7th Grade Introduction to Synthetic Biology
For 7th Graders we decided to introduce the concepts of synthetic biology, since they had just be introduced to DNA in their science classes.  Aside from teaching a general idea of what synthetic biology is, we also introduced them to some basic laboratory techniques essential to synthetic biology. We made up scenarios and asked them to solve these problems using different combinations of standardized parts (promoter, RBS, different ORFs, etc.). They also learned how to use micropipettes and run a gel!

Science Research Symposium
During the school year when we were brainstorming for potential project ideas, our team members were divided into several groups and gave presentations on those topics at the school’s Science Research Symposium.  Over 80 students from 11 research classes presented their own research from all different areas to the school community.  This allowed us to receive feedback on our project ideas from both students and teachers. This really helped us decide our final project idea.

Spring Fair
This is a photo of a lower school student at our booth, playing our interactive game and learning about what it is like to have cataracts.
During Spring Fair we conducted a survey to gather public opinion and designed an interactive game to raise awareness of cataracts. In the survey we asked questions regarding people’s opinions on genetically modified organisms, cataract surgery, and our project. For the game we taped parafilm onto lab goggles and asked people who came to our booth to play the “piano tiles” app with those goggles on, and thus experiencing a real life simulation of the effects of cataracts on vision.

Introduction
Overview
Pernicious anemia is described first by James S. Combe in 1822. Pernicious anemia is a type of anemia occurs due to malabsorption of vitamin B12 in the small intestine due to problems with the production of Intrinsic Factor, which is responsible for the absorption of vitamine B12. Pernicious anemia shows its stiking effects on blood, gastro-intestinal tract and nervous system and pernicious anemia usually develops together with an autoimmune disease. Our aim as ITU MOBGAM IGEM Team, is to design a bacterium that is capable of surviving in small intestine and secreting Intrinsic Factor dependent on pH. Also, we design a genetic circuit for controlling the overgrowth and containment of bacteria.
Introduction
Geneal Information
Pernicious Anemia, which is recognized as an autoimmune disorder, is caused by atrophic damage of the gastric body mucosa in which results loss of parietal cells that express a 60-kd glycoprotein called intrinsic factor (IF). (1,2) Function of IF is binding and transporting vitamine B12 in small intestine. It is essential for the absorption of vitamine B12.(3) The main cause of pernicious anemia is vitamin B12 deficiency. Vitamin B12 cannot be synthesized in the human body and it must be taken by diet. Only the animal products contain vitamin B12 and the minimum daily requirement of vitamin B12 is about 2.5 µg.  (3) Absorption of B12
The main source of vitamin B12 is daily diet. When the source vitamin B12 reach to stomach, gastric secretions digest and reveal vitamin B12 content which will bind R-binding protein (haptocorin). Vitamin B12 and R-binding protein travels through duodenum of small intestine. R-binding protein switch with intrinsic factor. Vitamin B12 is transported to terminal ileum where absorption occurs with IF. Vitamin B12-IF complex is recognized by intrinsic factor receptors on luminal membranes of ileal cells and absorbed. ("

Communication with experts
Zhejiang Marine Fisheries
Field trip to Zhoushan Fishery
Project-in-action
In our Human Practice this year, we majorly concentrated on promoting the concept of synthetic biology through interdisciplinary communication and field practice at fishery industry. During this process, we gained a better perception of the development of synthetic biology in China, and also learned valuable practical knowledge from experts, public and other iGEM teams.
Communication with experts in different disciplines
In the preparing stage of the project, after early investigation and brainstorming, our team chose applying synthetic biology in silt reinforcement as our project theme. To gain more information on this topic, we consulted Professor Zheng Junjie from Civil Engineering College of Huazhong University of Science and Technology. Prof. Zheng is an expert in civil processing who is also experienced in microbial silt reinforcement.
Our teammate, Shuyan Tang is talking with Prof. Zheng
Prof. Zheng explained the current role that Biology plays in the interdisciplinary study of silt reinforcement. Bacillus is widely applied in most microbial silt reinforcement studies for its high performance in biomineralization. It can release massive CO2 from respiration, immobilize surrounding Ca2+, and generate carbonate deposition, thus accomplishes the silt fixation. For now, scientists are still optimizing the experiment condition and questing for better strain. Silt reinforcement technology has a bright future in engineering science. It can not only be applied in ancient architecture repairing, sea filling and land accretion, but also help build artificial reefs and aquafarms. Currently, most artificial reefs are constructed through chemical methods. They are made by cement concrete, molded into certain shapes and put into the ocean to help accelerate the biodiversity evolution process and restore the ecological environment.
Prof. Zheng’s introduction on artificial reefs raised our interests, and the effect of ecological restoration brought by microbial artificial reefs was what we hope to achieve by applying synthetic biology. After team discussion, we set a new direction for our project and presented it to Prof. Zheng. We intend to use the marine yeast as our chassis, which has survival advantages in marine environment.

More Applications
First of all, the project has the goal to unravel the secrets of nature according to pattern formation. Many have argued that a lot of things can be learned and understood by looking at nature. However, nature still holds many secrets hidden from the world, often cell-cell interaction and communication related. There can be a lot learned about nature from the same principles we are aiming to understand with our research. A better understanding of the pattern formation process in combination with the appropriate and detailed predictive mathematical models will also be advantageous in many other fields. As already discussed in the section Potential Analysis , bacteria can be used to make bone replacements more efficient. But there is still a wide range of other applications possible.
Tumor formation and the development of metastasis
Tumor formation is an example in which the medical world could benefit from a deeper, fundamental knowledge of pattern formation. Since most cancers begin as a disease in which the tissue pattern formation is aberrant, a thorough insight in the process is necessary. Hereby, bacteria form the perfect starting point to investigate the respond of single cells on different stimuli present in the environment.  A better understanding of those mechanisms can result in a different approach to the treatment of certain cancers.
Miniature electrical conductors and circuits
Electrical circuits can be found everywhere in today's world, from traditional examples like kitchen appliances and radio's to the circuits in a pacemaker. A field that has particular success is micro-electronics, that is mainly interesting in the construction of integrated circuits. In the long term, the ability to construct predesigned patterns of bacteria could lead to applications in miniature electrical conductors and/or electrical circuits. The first step is to create the desired pattern, whereafter the bacteria can deposit electrical conducting substances. This clearly anticipates to the tendency of making electrical wires and integrated                              circuits as small as possible.
Novel biomaterials
Since the beginning of the industrial revolution, people have been mainly using concrete, cement and bricks as the main construction material. This situation remained largely unquestioned for more than 150 years. However quite recently, climate change and resource limitations are challenging the sustainability of traditional construction materials. In the search for new eco-friendly construction materials, the idea to use bacteria comes more and more into the picture. Initiatives like ‘the bacteria grown bricks from BioMason’ and ‘the sand solidifying Spor"

Lacking enough time and equipment, we cannot finish the Calibration part-which is about to find out the relation about OD600 versus the number of cells and RFU versus mass of GFP-before wiki freeze .

Note
In order to be considered for the Best Model award , you must fill out this page.
Mathematical models and computer simulations provide a great way to describe the function and operation of BioBrick Parts and Devices. Synthetic Biology is an engineering discipline, and part of engineering is simulation and modeling to determine the behavior of your design before you build it. Designing and simulating can be iterated many times in a computer before moving to the lab. This award is for teams who build a model of their system and use it to inform system design or simulate expected behavior in conjunction with experiments in the wetlab.
Here are a few examples from previous teams:

UC_Chile,2013,Team:UC Chile#Purification_-_-_TEXT.html," way of recover a modified microorganism. To achieve this, they attached bacterioferritin (Bfr) from Escherichia coli to Pdu40. Also, they include a tag for destination to the inside of Pdu. Bfr forms a large storage protein for iron and iron oxides. This should concentrate the particles inside the BMC and make it simple to separate with a magnet (2) .
We thought about attaching a protein such as Bfr to one of the proteins of the shell in the Carboxysome in order for the microcompartment to be coated with metallic particles and thus, be able to be purified using its magnetic properties. However, proteins from Magnetosome associated systems or from the electron transport chain (ferritin, etc.) exceed the size and the complexity to be used for such a purpose.
Then, after some searching for alternative mechanisms with high yield of purification, we decided to mainly focus on different affinity chromatography strategy.
3) Biotinylation
In 2010, the Freiburg Bioware iGEM team designed Virus Construction Kit for Therapy. In their project, they tried two different approaches for the purification of the virus capsides. One methodology was based on HisTag affinity purification and the other one was based on biotinylation of capsid. According to their results the detection limit of the biotinylated viral capsids was about 10 fold more sensitive (4) .
The principal advantages of this procedure is that with this mechanism you can isolate a protein complex in an assembled way and have the protein aggregate ready for further analysis; it also shows good yield results.
How does biotinylation works?
In nature, E. coli biotin holoenzyme synthetase, BirA catalyzes the transfer of biotin to the epsilon amino group of a specific lysine residue of the biotin carboxyl carrier protein (BCCP) subunit of acetyl-CoA carboxylase (4) .
Schatz et al (5) .  Identified the 15 amino acid peptide 5’ GLNDIFEAQKIEWHE 3’ as the most efficient sequence to produce biotinylation. Therefore, if it is added to any protein of interest and in the presence of the BirA gene, the protein of interest could be selectively tagged.
Using this approach, we learnt from our host lab PSBL about the INTACT (isolation of nuclei tagged in specific cell types) method for the purification of nuclei from plants (6) . This technique purifies biotin"

The second level would allow us to rent out the reclamation module along with the organisms to cities, farmers, or homeowners. This would allow these stakeholders to benefit from the collected phosphorus by selling it to us or on the open market. We would be selling replacement parts and packaged bacteria to allow refills once the filters become less efficient. This second level would benefit from those who might not want to directly manage their system but view it as an investment where they can profit from the waste phosphors they may generate or have access to. The third level of our business plan would involve the leasing of the whole system, with propagation and encapsulation methods. This would allow groups to have complete control over the process to fit their specific needs. The phosphorus they accumulate could be sold back to our business for wholesale or could be sold on the open market.
Application
Our system collects and concentrates phosphorus out of the environment. Since there are a wide range of possible applications, the flexibility of our system can truly be tested. Below are some possible applications our team and stakeholders have identified, however we expect many more will be identified as our technology proliferates.
Wastewater Treatment Plants: Current wastewater treatment plants are being pressured by the Environmental Protection Agency to reduce the levels of phosphorus in post-treatment wastewater. A common biological method of phosphorus removal is incubation with phosphorus-accumulating organisms (PAOs). Their ability to store luxury amounts of phosphorus is what our system attempts to imitate, our system however benefits from a common and well understood chassis and the ability to engineer the organism effectively.
Home Bioreactors: Our system could be implemented on the scale of the home instead of the community. Allowing citizens to take ownership of their resources and environmental impact. A easy to use home based bioreactor would open to doors to modular design, which would allow widespread remediation, taking strain off the wastewater treatment plant.
Tile Drains: The largest use of phosphorus is in fertilizers spread on agricultural fields. When this farmland experiences heavy rainfall, sections of the field can flood and phosphorus can be washed into nearly waterways. A common solution to flooding is an underground tile drain system, that allows water in over-saturated soils to drain into a ditch or waterway. Placing our phosphorus reclamation module (PRM) at the outlet of these pipes or at chokepoints in the ditches and waterways would allow collection of the runoff phosphorus before it was able to spread further into the"

UNIPV-Pavia,2009,Team:UNIPV-Pavia#Pavia_-_-_TEXT.html," Italian name Pavia. Sometimes it's been referred to as Ticinum Papia, combining both Latin names.
Under the Goths, Pavia became a fortified citadel and their last bulwark in the war against Belisarius.
After the Lombards conquest, Pavia became the capital of their kingdom (AD. 568-774). During the Rule of the Dukes, it was ruled by Zaban. It continued to function as the administrative centre of the kingdom, but by the reign of Desiderius, it had deteriorated as a first-rate defensive work and Charlemagne took it in the Siege of Pavia (June, 774) assuming the kingship of the Lombards. Pavia remained the capital of the Italian Kingdom and the centre of royal coronations until the diminution of imperial authority there in the twelfth century. Cathedral of Pavia.
In the 12th century Pavia acquired the status of a self-governing commune. In the political division between Guelphs and Ghibellines that characterizes the Italian Middle Ages, Pavia was traditionally Ghibelline, a position that was as much supported by the rivalry with Milan as it was a mark of the defiance of the Emperor that led the Lombard League against the emperor Frederick Barbarossa, who was attempting to reassert long-dormant Imperial influence over Italy.
In the following centuries Pavia was an important and active town. Under the Treaty of Pavia, Emperor Louis IV granted during his stay in Italy the Palatinate to his brother Duke Rudolph's descendants. Pavia held out against the domination of Milan, finally yielding to the Visconti family, rulers of that city in 1359; under the Visconti Pavia became an intellectual and artistic centre, being the seat from 1361 of the University of Pavia founded around the nucleus of the old school of law, which attracted students from many countries.
The Battle of Pavia (1525) marks a watershed in the city's fortunes, since by that time, the former cleavage between the supporters of the Pope and those of the Holy Roman Emperor had shifted to one between a French party (allied with the Pope) and a party supporting the Emperor and King of Spain Charles V. Thus during the Valois-Habsburg Italian Wars, Pavia was naturally on the Imperial (and Spanish) side. The defeat and capture of king Francis I of France during the battle ushered in a period of Spanish occupation which lasted until 1713. Pavia was then ruled by the Austrians until 1796, when it was"

OVERVIEW
iGEM team UNITS_trieste is composed by 6 students 2 advisors and 4 instructors: a small team with a great idea!!
The first meetings with the complete team started in march, however we individually started thinking of good ideas for iGEM in november 2010, so we did a hard work also before starting the actual work in the lab.
At the beginning there was only three members in the team and it seemed impossible to find all the necessary for our project, but we finally enlarged the team proper to the actual 6 members, and then together we found the teachers and researchers who helped us and critically judged our ideas for iGEM (we thought of at least at 50 ideas before finding the right one!). After a lot of meetings with different people, we found our path and we designed our project, which was approved and enthusiastically received by all our advisors with a “great idea guys!!!we can help you, let's start working!!!”.
Lots of people who are not an actual part of the team have carefully listened to our imaginative projects and helped us find the right way, giving us a great support for which we deeply thank them all!!

More information about the Biobricks used within the program
The plasmid generated by the program is based on the pSB1A3 backbone which is a frequently-used plasmid carrying an ampicillin resistance. The design used for the logic gates is based on the His-Terminator design (see project for details). If required for output proteins the  ribosome binding site B0034 was used. For the constitutive promoter, positioned upstream of every logic gate, the software uses the J23100 promoter. Details about input and output Biobricks are supplied within the program. For all input BioBricks, the program only incorporates the target DNA sequence of the corresponding BioBrick. If a separate protein is required to bind the DNA, please note that this protein will not be included on the plasmid.

Tutorial
The program consists of three modules: Construct, Verify and Synthesize. The first allows the user to enter inputs, whereas the second and third supply the user with information about the network.
Construct: Is the first module that enables the user to provide the inputs and outputs as well as the logic relations (AND, OR, NOT) to build a logic network to 'connect' inputs and outputs. The nods of the network correspond with the logic relations and the edges with the values 'true' or 'false'.
Verify: This module illustrates in the colors green for true and red for false which nods and relations are assigned the values 'true' or 'false'.
Sythesize: This module assigns the abstract logic network concrete sequences, e.g. terminator sequences, generates random transmitter sequences and provides all the genetic information to rebuild the network.
The different modules are described in detail below.
1. Step: Construct a logic network
Read more
A logic network can be designed by adding gates (via double clicking) and interconnecting them (via selecting two gates and pressing the 'C' key).
There are five different types of gates: inputs, outputs, AND-gates, OR-gates and NOT-gates. The type of a gate can be changed by clicking on the combo box on the gate and selecting a type. Gates can be interconnected by selecting (via clicking inside the area of a gate) two gates and then pressing the C key (for connect). A complete logic network has to have at least one input and at least one output. Different gates may require different numbers of ingoing and outgoing connections (e.g. a NOT-gate requires one ingoing connection and allows for an arbitrary number of outgoing connections"

DTU-Denmark,2011,Team:DTU-Denmark-2#Project#Other assembly systems_-_-_TEXT.html," phage genome attP sites are found, and on the host bacterial genome attB sites are found. After recombination the att sites, hybrid sequences contain sequence from both the phage and the host att site and are then called attL and attR (5). Gateway cloning enables the assembly of multiple DNA fragments. Taking advantage of the site-specific clonase enzymes and the att sites, the problems with conventional cloning method are avoided, which use restriction enzymes and ligase (6).
The way it's done
In the Gateway technology four different recombination sites attB, attP, attL and attR are utilized (4). attB sites always recombine with attP sites in a reaction mediated by the BP clonase, and attL-sites recombine with attR-sites mediated by LR clonase. Furthermore, attB1 reacts only with attP1 and not attP2, thereby maintaining the orientation of the transferred DNA fragment and the reading frame (5). In the Gateway® cloning system the final plasmid is obtained through two steps of cloning.  Through PCR amplification with primers flanked with attB BioBricks for the first recombination, the BP reaction. First PCR fragments with the appropriate att sites and orientation has to be constructed as shown in the figure below.
The Gateway Assembly can assemble up to 4 DNA fragments into one vector. The Gateway assembly is executed in the same way whether you join two or four DNA fragments. Depending on the number of fragments specific att sites are attached, always starting with attB1 and ending with attB2 (4) .
Difference between Plug'n Play assembly and Gateway assembly
The gateway assembly relies on a kit from Invitrogen. Furthermore, different entry clones and destination vectors are often needed and requires that a big library is established first. Furthermore, the biggest difference between the two assembly systems are the speed. The Gateway assembly takes longer time, because it relies on two cloning and transformation steps, before the final plasmid is obtained. Thus, the Gateway Assembly is far more complex than Plug 'n’ Play.
In fusion
In-fusion assembly is a method for assembling of two or more parts, provided by Clontech. The assembly system can be semi-standardized by simple primer design rules, minimizing the time used on planning the assembly reactions.
The way it's done
The PCR fragments are assembled with the use of at least 15bp homology on both ends. The forward primer of the first PCR fragment must be homologues to the reverse primer of the second PCR fragment and so forth. The assembly"
Sumbawagen,2014,Team:Sumbawagen#Human practice#survey_-_-_TEXT.html," 7 teams to do the survey. Each team did the survey at 1 producer regions and 1 consumer regions. The survey was held on July 14-17 2014.
C. Data Analysis
We would like to give our gratitude to all Sumbawa society that had been participated in our policy and practices project. There are 672 respondents which consist of 130 producers, 71 distributors, and 471 consumers participated in the project. The data analysis were given below:
1. Have you ever consume Sumbawa honey?
Most of our respondents have consumed Sumbawa honey. It shows that Sumbawa honey is a very important commodity for Sumbawa society.
2. Is there any tools which can be used to measure glucose level in Sumbawa honey?
Many of our respondents said they don’t know the tools to measure the glucose level in Sumbawa honey.
3. If the answer for no. 2 is YES, please mention the tools
None of our respondents could mention the tool used to measure glucose level in Sumbawa honey.
Although some of our respondents said that there is a tool exist to measure glucose in Sumbawa honey, they couldn’t mention the name. After interviewed them little bit deeper we figured out that society has perception that the tool is the same with the tool used to measure water level, but the fact it's different. If they want to know glucose level in Sumbawa honey (especially the distributor) they have to send honey sample to Mataram (the capital city of West Nusa Tenggara province).
4. If there is a tool created to measure the glucose level in honey, how would you respond?
The society gave the positive response for this question. Most of producers want to use (58%), and just 7% didn’t care about it. The distributor respondents who want to learn and use the tool are almost same (47% and 46%). Meanwhile, most of the consumers want to learn (53%).
5. Are you android smartphone user?
In Sumbawa society, android smartphone is familiar among teens. Hence in the survey, only a small number of respondents using android smartphone: producer is only 29%, distributor is only 15%, and the consumer is only 30%.
6. If the answer of question number 5 is “YES”, are you using android smartphone application?
Most of android user use android aplication beacuse there are various and cheap applications in android market, even some are distributed for free.
7. If the answer is “YES” for question number 6, is android smartphone"
TUDelft,2018,Team:TUDelft#Design_-_-_TEXT.html,"2 Gene Doping Model: Understanding Gene Doping
Aim: Model the process of infection and degradation of gene doping DNA in blood and predict the time dependent concentration of cell-free gene-doping DNA.
Approach: We considered the entire process of gene doping to fully understand the underlying mechanisms of gene doping and its effect on the athlete in our Gene Doping Model. We started with the process of DNA delivery using viral vectors, including both intramuscular (IM) and intravenous (IV) injection methods, followed by the process of infection of kidney cells with the viral vectors, and finally the origination and degradation of cell free gene doping DNA in the blood. We used the human erythropoietin (EPO) gene as our model gene, and have thus included the EPO-dependent production of red blood cells in our model through a series of partial differential equations. Figure 3 shows the simplified process in the body for gene doping with the EPO gene. The result was a time-dependant concentration in the bloodstream of the gene doping DNA, which was used in the wetlab experiments. The detailed information on this model can be found on our Modeling page .
Figure 3. A representation of EPO based gene doping. Viral vectors infect kidney cells, increasing their production of EPO. The increased concentration of EPO in the blood leads to an increased production of red blood cells. The red blood cell count acts as a feedback loop that determines the endogenous production of EPO.
1.3 Extraction Verification
Aim: Verify successful extraction of low concentrated cfDNA from blood serum.
Approach: To verify successful extraction of the low amounts of cfDNA, we combined two approaches. First we quantified the cfDNA using the Qubit High Sensitivity (HS) dsDNA kit. Second, we verified the correct DNA extraction by amplification of the bovine albumin gene, a standard for verification of genomic mammalian DNA extraction and recommended by Sanquin, using nested PCR.
Figure 4. Graphical representation of the nested PCR on the bovine albumin gene. First round of PCR amplifies a fragment of 229 bp. Product of the first round will be used as a template for the second round, amplifying the final fragment of 153 bp.
1.4 Gene Doping DNA Extraction
Aim: Show successful extraction of predicted concentrations of gene doping DNA.
Approach: We used an artificial intronless human EPO gene to simulate gene doping. Prior to the extraction we spiked the serum with this EPO gene doping DNA, using concentrations matching the predicted values of gene doping DNA from"
