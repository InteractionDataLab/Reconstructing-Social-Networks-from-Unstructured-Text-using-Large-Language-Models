After 16h of incubation at 37°C with agitation at 200rpm, each sample was subcultured into 5 ml of fresh, equally supplemented LB and cells were grown for 2 hours more. 1 ml of the subculture was then retrieved and pelleted. The pellet was resuspended in 1 ml PBS. 100 µl of these samples was mixed with 100 µl laemmli buffer, and the sample boiled for 10 min. The indicated volume of each sample was loaded on a SDS gel (12% acrylamide). pSB1C3, and pUniprom were included as a negative control, and PmanA-gfp as a positive control. The blot against 6-His – ChrB was without success and is not shown. No chromate of any kind was added to the medium previous to this blot, hence no expression of GFP was expected.

Enzymology
CL: This week we performed our third FFA assay once again using the FFA kit from BioAssay Systems.  We tested 8 samples (BTE with Sigma70 promoter in Iq cells)along with two negative controls (Sigma70 in Iq cells).  Results proved positive as sample absorbency was significantly higher than those of the negative conrols (0.069 vs 0.037).  We tested the positive samples on the GC, but did not obtain conclusive results as none of the samples had fatty acids present. We believe there was a protocol error as we most like evaporated the samples too far and evaporated our sample FA's along with the extraction solvent.  We will prep for another GC test.
Media
We began testing the apparatus to ensure that there are no leaks in the system and that cross-contamination cannot occur between the chambers.  We ran the apparatus overnight with a culture of Iq cells in LB with 34 µg/mL chloramphenicol.  No contamination was seen after 8 hours.  However, after 30 hours, E. coli had spread to the cyano chamber.  Our best guess is that contamination occurred 18-24 hours into the experiment.  Indicating that the o-rings are not providing quite a tight enough seal between the dialysis tubing and its glass fitting.  But the water pump did survive overnight, and no leaks were observed.  The apparatus will be sterilized and we will attempt to grow a culture without contamination again.
Made 3 liters of BG-11 with 50 mM glucose for growing a large culture of Synechocystis.  By the next day, the vessel we were holding the BG-11 in had ruptured.  Remaining media was transferred to three 1 liter bottles and re-autoclaved.  This media was used to start two 500 mL cultures of cyano.

The cells were heat-fixed on a slide and observed under the widefield microscope at 37°C. Furthermore, imaged E. coli with and without the BolA-gene (induced) under SEM. The samples were fixed with gluteraldehyde and imaged with SEM. We used an FEI Niva Nano 450 SEM, under high vacuum.
Results and discussion
The four different strains were imaged under the widefield microscope, the taken images are shown in figure 2.
Figure 2: Widefield images of E. coli BL21 transformed with (A) the OmpA-silicatein gene, (B) BolA under the inducible Lac promoter and induced with 1 mM IPTG, (C) BolA under the constitutive promoter J23100, (D) BolA and OmpA-silicatein fusion under the inducible Lac promoter and induced with 1 mM IPTG.
In figure 2, the widefield images of the four tested strains are shown. In figure 2A we can see cells with the characteristic wildtype E. coli phenotype; the cells are rod-shaped. Figure 2B shows that induction of the cells transformed wil BolA under the inducible Lac-promoter indeed has changed the phenotype of the cell. The cells have clearly become spherical. Constitutive expression of the BolA gene, as shown in 1C has the opposite result: the cells are rod-shaped and elongated. This is probably because of the stress the plasmid puts on the cells. As mentioned before, BolA is a gene involved in the stress response of E. coli that changes the morphology of the cells. A too high expression of the gene could therefore change the morphology in an unexpected way, such as elongation, a phenomena that is often observed in E. coli (Höltje, 1998) . Since we require sphere-shaped cells, constitutive expression of the BolA-gene is not desired. Co-expression of the OmpA-silicatein fusion plasmid and the inducible BolA plasmid also yielded round cells, as seen in figure 2D.
To get a more detailed view of the shape of the cells transformed with BolA, we also imaged the cells using SEM, the results are shown in figure 3.

PROGRAMMING SYNTHETIC SILK
Abstract
Spiders have evolved an arsenal of silk threads for various applications, using combinations of highly-repetitive silk proteins. These fibers have an extremely high range of tensile strength and elasticity, and along with their low immunogenicity, are desired by the military, medical, and fashion industries. However, spider silk farming is impractical, and alternatives are necessary for large-scale production. Inspired by nature’s design, we aim to engineer E. coli to produce genetically programmed synthetic fibers, and standardize the customization of their physical and functional properties. We have adapted Iterative Capped Assembly to modularize and flexibly control the assembly of silk domains that confer strength or elasticity in specific ratios. Varying the composition of the silk genes, or adding other functional proteins will allow precise fine-tuning of the resulting properties, and expand their practical utility. This platform can be readily applied to assemble other highly-repetitive proteins, or large genes from libraries of parts.
Projects
Customizing Silk
Modifying the genetic structure of silk can create a diverse new range of biomaterials.
With spider silk as our basis, we started to experiment with the genetic structure of silk. We rearranged portions of the repetitive DNA code to see how it affected the strength, elasticity, and spinning capabilities using Golden Gate Cloning and Iterative Capped Assembly. Click this text to learn about this portion of our project in-depth.
Functionalizing Fibers
By attaching various proteins, we can create silk with specific applications.
Glowing silk is an idea that appeals both to the scientific and artistic worlds. It is a proof of concept for the scientists, demonstrating how we are able to functionalize silk fibers, and an interesting new material to work with for the artists. This method can be applied to different kinds of proteins with different functions as well, but every idea has to start small. To see how we attached GFP to our silk constructs, click this text.
Processing Silk
Engineering our silk is only half the work, creating a tangible product is the rest.

Home » Our System
Our two-cell system (pictured in the schematic below) involves a Sender Cell and a Receiver Cell. Although many iGEM teams work with bacteria such as E. coli, we chose Human Embryonic Kidney (HEK) 293T cells for several reasons. HEK 293T cell lines are immortal and very simple to work with – one of our team members called them the “E. coli of mammalian cells”. Working with mammalian cells (human cells specifically), allows easier translation of discoveries into therapeutic benefit. For example, a relevant recent paper in Science (Ye, Daoud-El Baba, Peng, & Fussenegger, 2011) chose HEK 293T cells to demonstrate the controlling of a simple synthetic circuit with blue light. They then proceeded to test this system in mice, finding that they could induce insulin production in diabetic mice when blue light was shone through their skin, which resulted in significant therapeutic effects.
The Sender Cell
The goal of the sender cell was to be able to trigger robust production of blue light. We decided on luciferases – enzymes which catalyze the oxidation of a substrate luciferin and release blue wavelength photons in the process:
luciferin + O2 → oxyluciferin + light
Lucifereases are luminescent and not fluorescent, so they do not require excitation to emit light. They simply require the addition of the luciferin substrate. We obtained and tested two different luciferases: Gaussia Luciferase and Renilla Luciferase. The substrate of these luciferases is Coelenterazine, a molecule which easily diffuses through the HEK 293T membrane. We tested the relative light outputs of Gaussia and Renilla and found that Renilla emitted significantly more light , so we chose Renilla as the workhorse of our Sender Cell.
When choosing a promoter for Renilla, we selected the CMV promoter. This promoter is known for its extremely high and robust levels in"

Enzyme activity may vary depending on incubation buf-  fers and temperature, as well as the storage conditions and number  of freeze-thaw cycles to which the enzyme preparation has been  subjected. Different dilution schemes of the same enzyme source  may also cause variation in activity. Cellulase complexes may  contain multiple classes of enzymes. For these reasons, we recom-  mend preparing new standard curves on the same day samples  are run, preferably on the same microplate. Use an appropriate  enzyme standard of known specific activity that closely matches  the cellulase activity being determined.

Braunschweig,2014,Team:Braunschweig#Project-content_-_-_TEXT.html," type which is used, i.e. its molecular weight and thus its viscosity in a solution. Typically, a 1 – 4 wt.% alginate solution is used to prepare beads. This is more or less also the alginate content of the resulting beads.
5. What is the ordinary concentration of cells included in the alginate beads?
Usually, an initial cell concentration of 107 - 109 is used when the beads are prepared.
6. Is E. coli able to grow inside the alginate beads?
Yes, they are. Typically, the beads with the initial cell loading are cultivated for some time (depends on how fast the cells are growing) in order to let them grow inside the beads. At the end a large part the whole bead volume can consist of cells provided that they are still provided with the necessary nutrients.
7. Are the ingredients of alignate beads in any way toxic for E. coli or the cow?
No, not at all. Alginate is a natural polysaccharide produced from algae. It is also used as thickener for food applications, e.g. for yoghurt or ice cream.
8. Under what circumstances do the alginate beads disintegrate? (shearing, pH, phosphate concentration? any components of the rumen fluid?)
The pH value is usually not critical as long as it is within a physiological range. A disintegration may occur if considerable phosphate concentrations are present as in that case calcium phosphate will precipitate. The removal of calcium as crosslinker will lead to a dissolution of the beads. A mechanical disintegration needs considerable shear rates.
9. Are the alginate beads able to protect E. coli against other bacteria occuring inside the rumen. For example ciliates are known to ingest many bacteria such as E. coli?
Yes. No other organism can penetrate the alginate bead.
10. Are the alginate beads able to protect E. coli when ruminated?
I’m not sure but I’m afraid that the beads will be destroyed by chewing.

Bielefeld-CeBiTec,2018,Team:Bielefeld-CeBiTec#Software_-_-_TEXT.html," the 3' terminus. Both sequence extensions are also part of our vector system, enabling efficient design and construction of effective siRNAs. If our vector system is selected when using our tool, the fitting overlaps to our vectors are added automatically. More theoretical information about the overhangs and scaffolds can be found here .
Figure 2: siRNA design for silencing translation. A If the siRNA does not carry suitable 5' or 3' extensions, it is quickly degraded. B siRNAs supplemented with the outer membrane protein A (OmpA) scaffold are more stable and effectively silence the translation of target mRNAs. C If the siRNA is supplemented with the OmpA as well as the MicC scaffold the repression is enhanced further.
Choosing appropriate design methods
In 2012, the iGEM team SYSU-Software integrated an siRNA cDNA designer as a small part of their project. siRNAs designed with this tool were applicable in eukaryotic organisms. They included two different design methods: Tom Tuschl’s method and Rational siRNA design. In the following as well as in our software tool siRCon, nucleotide sequences exclusively contain the letter 'T' for sake of simplicity. Please note that in the case of RNA, the corresponding base is uracil.
Figure 3: Structure of an siRNA designed with Tom Tuschl's method. Both siRNA have a characteristic 'TT' overhang at the 3'-terminus (Elbashir et al., 2001).
Tom Tuschl’s method focuses mainly on the existence of 5’ and 3’ ‘TT’ overhangs (Figure 3) (Elbashir et al., 2001). These are not compatible with overhangs and scaffold sequences required by the prokaryotic mechanisms. Therefore, we decided to use the rules published by Ui-Tei as an alternative design method (Naito and Ui-Tei, 2012). Furthermore, we adapted the rational siRNA design as it was more suitable for our application (Reynolds et al., 2004). Both design rules apply only to the 19 nt long target binding sequence.
Rational siRNA design
By a systematic analysis of 180 eukaryotic siRNAs, Reynolds et al. identified eight criteria that are important for their functionality (Reynolds et al., 2004). Each criterion gets a score that is either positive or negative, corresponding to its effect on the siRNA. All siRNA candidates with a score above"

TU-Munich,2013,Team:TU-Munich#Project#Bioaccumulation_-_-_TEXT.html," GST-tags for separation, elucidation of direct protein-protein interaction and purification of the GST-fusion protein mostly by pull-down assay. So targeting GST with molecule therapeutics represents GTS as an attractive target for drug discovery [ McIlwain et al.,2006 ].
A mammalian variant of GST, GSTP, plays a major role in cancer- development and potential drug/chemotherapeutic resistance in a majority of tumor cell lines: The inhibition of the pro-apoptotic pathway (JNK pathway) and the overexpression of GSTP in tumor cells lead to escape of apoptosis of the tumor cells mediated by non GSTP- substance-drugs [ Hayes et al.,1995 ] [ Josephy,2010 ] [ Hayes et al.,2000 ] [ Fraser et al.,2003 ]. To avoid the time- and labor-intensive method HPLC following derivatization with 2-nitrobenzoic acid we used the common sensitive technique with monochlorobimane to measure GSH as a proof of principle. The adding of monochlorobimane to the culture medium leads to the conjugation of GSH to monochlorobimane catalyzed by DDT Dehyrochlorinase (see Figure 7). The GSH-monochlorobimane conjugate can be measured fluorometrically [ Kamencic et al.,2000 ].

The Problem: Algal Blooms
Figure 8: Eutrophication
Which phenomenon implicates the common name “Florida red tide”? This term is used in annually along Florida waters where species known as Karenia brevis leads to a red colored alga bloom along the Florida coast. Algal blooms are a worldwide environmental problem! This becomes evident with the appointment of 10.000 people for cleaning up the algal bloom in Beijing for the Olympic discipline “sailing regatta” in 2008. Depending on the cause, bacteria algal can bloom at concentrations of hundreds to thousands of cells per milliliter. An officially recognized threshold level isn’t public. Possible diverse factors which are the reason for the high affecting of bloom formation are listed followed:
Light intensity: cyanobacteria which form surface blooms have a higher  tolerance concerning high light intensities. This leads to lower growth rate than other phytoplankton organisms.
Gas vacuoles: Gas vesicles give the cyanobacteria a lower density than water.
Growth rate: Slow growth rates require long water retention times to enable a bloom.

KULeuven,2011,Team:KULeuven#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," enough DNA for performing restrictions. Since the miniprep kits usually give lower concentrations than the CTAB method, we decided to switch to the CTAB method. This  method takes a little bit longer than minipreparations with a kit, but we expected to get higher amounts of DNA. However, this was not the case here. Since Thursday we also noticed the agar plates seemed to be contaminated and we decided to start all over again.
Week 6
This week we started with minipreparations of the promoters and GFP that were transformed in TOP10 cells last week. This time, the CTAB method worked very well, resulting in  high DNA concentrations. Due to this we were able to perform restrictions and ligations. Unfortunately we only found false positive colonies. Next week we hope to get beter results by switching back to the 3A assembly method.
Week 7
We did multiple minipreparations and restrictions this week. The results of the restriction purification were bad.  The high point of this week however was the ligation of two biobricks; the BAD promoter and GFP. Next week we will continue to ligate the other biobricks with the same protocol.
Week 8
We concentrated on the basic ligations of 2 biobricks with the new technique that had been successful the week before. We also ligated all the promoters to GFP and transformed them into bacteria that are capable of taking in arabinose/lactose.
Week 9 and 10
The basic ligations were nearly finished so during the ninth week we started ligating 3 biobricks to eachother. We also measured the amount of fluorescence the promoters, ligated to GFP, produced after being induced.
Week 11
This week we started ligating our biobricks into the chloramphenicol vector.Due to the successful ligation of HybB to GFP we were able to test the promoter strength.
Week 12
The iGEM Wetlab team spent the final days of the competition trying to get the last biobricks ligated into the chloramphenicol vector.
Week 13
The first week after the wiki freeze we tested multiple waters and concluded that deionised water showed the least fluctuations in its ice nucleation temperature. We also started a new set of experiments to further characterize INP and AFP.

HKUST and HKU are the most active participants of the competition. Both of them joined the competition every year from 2008 to 2012. CUHK joined in since 2010, and HKBU participated in 2009 in cooperation with HKU (""Synthetic biology project,"").
Biotechnology Industry
Because of the predominance of market forces and source of capital, biotechnology industry in Hong Kong has been growing in recent years. According to the Innovation and Technology Commission, there are approximately 250 to 300 biotechnology-related companies in Hong Kong. They are mainly related to health-care business such as pharmaceuticals, traditional Chinese medicine, health-care products, and medical devices and diagnostics. These companies work on product research, manufacture, marketing and sales (""Innovation and technology,"" 2013).
Fascinated by the mature business operation environment and close relationship with China, a market with great potential, more international biotechnology companies are attracted to set their offices in Hong Kong. It is foreseeable that biotechnology industry will be much bigger in the coming future.
Biotechnology Industry Funding
Hong Kong government does invest on biotechnology and scientific researches by providing funding even though the amount is relatively low compared to that of the business sector. They also established the Innovation and Technology Commission (ITC) aiming to upgrade Hong Kong’s technological level and promote innovative ideas so as to increase the competitiveness of the economic activities. It provides the Innovation and Technology Fund (ITF) which grants various technology areas. According to the report on 30th June 2013, HK$ 7.5 billion (around US$ 970 million) was funded to 3376 projects in different technology areas. Among them, HK$ 462.1 million (around US$ 59 million) was invested to support 223 biotechnology projects. The ITF also granted HK$588.3 million (around US$ 76 million) out of total HK$7.5 billion (around US$ 970 million) to the industrial sector of biotechnology (“Innovation Technology,” 2013).
ITC also provided Applied Research Fund which gave funding support to technology ventures and research projects that have commercial potential. In 1993, the government invested HK$ 750 million (around US$ 96 million) to the funds. However, the fund ceased making new investments in the end of March in 2005. In total, HK$ 28.27 million (around US"

1. Designing the Heme sensing device
We have looked for the precedent researches on heme resistance of gut microbiome, we have decided to select the external detector system using HssS & HssR protein and the internal dectector utilizing HrtR protein. We designed a complete set comprised of promoter, sensing protein, and marker by inserting genetic marker instead of the efflux pump in the conventional mechanism.
2. Constructing the Heme sensing device
➀ In the case of HssS, HssR, we could find the matching sequence in Bacillus cereus ATCC 14579 by BLASTing the sequence that was mentioned in the former research. We received this bacteria from Korean Collection of Type Culture(KCTC), cultured them and collected a single colony.  We extracted the gDNA of B.cereus, and added igem prefix, suffix respectively to the front and end of these HssR, HssS sequences. We also conducted PCR of gDNA template using this primer we designed.
➁ We modified HrtR and its promoter by adding iGEM prefix at the front, and suffix at the end. Moreover, we ordered from the IDT as a gBlock. We inserted the arrived gBlock utilizing the 3A assemble and TA cloning. We also screened the bacteria with ones that do not show the expression of RFP.  We then cleaved the cloning vector using restriction enzymes and processed gel electrophoresis to check if the part was correct inserted.
3. Transformation of the Lactobacillus plantarum L67
We received L. plantarum L67 from the lab of Professor Se Jong Oh, Chonnam University. Then, we cultured the bacteria on MRS media and collected single colony. Then we tested antibiotic resistance to prove that we cultured the appropriate bacteria. For the selection of transformation vector of Lactobacillus, we have chosen the gram-positive shuttle vector that our lab already owned. We made electron competent cell of lactobacillus and attempted transformation in various conditions with different DNA amount and voltage. However, the transformation was unfortunately not successful, and we concluded that the"

Fig.6 Killing test results
More details can be found at Killing test
IV Improve the gene circuit of warrior I
    According to our results of the orthogonality test and the killing test, we cannot design a warrior I that can be killed by warrior II but not killed by itself regardless of whatever receptor-promoter pair we put inside warrior I. (See more at orthogonality test )
    The problem now becomes how to block warrior I’s response to C4HSL secreted by himself. Our model tells us if we design warrior I as below (Fig.7), we can make it only be killed by warrior II by just regulating the RBS of TetR to an appropriate intensity.
Fig.7 Improved gene circuit. The one on the top is warrior I while the one below is warrior II
See more details at Design of characters
Results are shown below:
Fig.8 Performance of improved gene circuit
See more information at Improved gene circuit
    Therefore, we proved that this problem could be solved by rational design and the further work is hopefully to succeed.
Design a game to make the public more interested in synthetic biology.
    Besides the bench work we did, to realize the educational purpose of our project and to make the public know more about synthetic biology, we designed our game---E.coli War!
    When children played this game during our exhibition in China Science and Technology Museum (CSTM), they found many interesting results which can even promote our understanding of this system. (Fig.9)(See more details at Exhibition at National Museum and Game Discovery ) Furthermore, this can also be helpful for our further research design.
Fig.9 Children are playing E.coli War in CSTM!)
V Discussion and future plan
    Except for a few results in Invertase assay (See more details in Invertase assay ), all of our results are obtained by 3 biological replicates, so they are credible.
    In conclusion, we designed a very general system to study many complex relationships and also a useful model to describe this system. In the future, it will be convenient to investigate some interesting questions with regard to relationships between populations and individuals by using this system.
    What’s more, we designed two interesting games--- Fluid E.coli War and Solid E.coli War to make the public"

Tsinghua,2018,Team:Tsinghua#Demonstrate_-_-_TEXT.html," the ""Morris Method"" for global sensitivity analysis. Morris Method is also known as Morris' OAT Method, where OAT stands for ""One At a Time"".  Namely, when using Morris Method, one parameter value undergoes is changed during each run. Parameters change within a confined parameter space, while a sensitivity measure named ""the elementary effect"" is calculated during each run.
$$[EE_i=\frac{f(x_1,x_2,...,x_i+\delta ,...,x_k)-y}{\delta}$$
In the test, $\mu^*$, the mean of the elementary effects, is used to measure the influence of a parameter on the output. The larger it is, the more this parameter would influence the model. $\sigma$, the variance, is a measure of non-linearity and/or interaction effects of the parameter.
4.2 Sensitivity Test of the Parameters
What is robustness? Robustness means some properties of the system are able to remain the same under perturbations. In our case, if our model is ""robust""  Here are some plots showing the elementary effects of several parameters. As expected, $\mu^*$ and $\sigma$ tend to increase over time.
Figure 10     Results of Sensitivity Test. Two Parameters Have Especially Large Impacts on the System When Perturbed.
These are just two pieces of snapshots of the results of a series of scans. Apparently, two parameters stand out to be much more sensitive than any other parameters. The lines that represent them are specially highlighted. These two parameters stand for “efficiency of lux pR promoter” and “binding affinity of luxR-AHL to lux pR”. Intriguingly, these two parameters involve lux pR, which is a primary interest in our project. In previous parts, we have already analyzed how lux pR efficiency greatly impacts our system. This accords with the conclusion drawn from the sensitivity test as well.
Following numerous repetitive runs of sensitivity test, we confirmed the only those two parameters addressed above are significantly sensitive to perturbations.
Based on this, we can say that our system is generally robust, as minor changes to the majority of the parameter values does not significantly affect the results. For now, our simulation results can be trusted to be useful.
Summary:
- The system is generally robust and stable according to our sensitivity analysis.
- The parameters related to properties of lux pR are relatively more sensitive to perturbations. This accords with our previous conclusions.

Formal Lab Session - 24th July 2009
Introduction
Preparing some LB solution
The previous lab session has seen the team make a start on the real lab work and also beginning to finish the work involved with the introductory lab sessions.
To begin the real lab work five BioBricks from the Spring Distribution were hydrated and stored in the freezer, namely BioBricks BBA_C0056 (cI in the lambda phage), BBa_B1002 (terminator sequence), BBa_C0077 (CinR activator), BBa_C0076 (autoinducer synthetase) and BBa_R0077 (promoter which is CinR and HSL regulated - RBS+)
The real lab work also involved the team inoculating 2 flasks of 100ml LB with E. coli containing pMUTIN4 and growing the cultures overnight in the 37ºC orbital incubator.
The introductory lab session work saw the team conduct the first few stages of the ethanol precipitation of the GFP and RFP midi-prep samples.
For work done for the introductory lab sessions, please click on this link . Meanwhile, as far as real lab work goes, the team needs to transform E. coli cells with the five BioBricks which were prepared yesterday from the Spring Distributions. The team also need to store away the cultures of E. coli cells which contain the pMUTIN4 plasmid.
Practical Outline
By the end of the day the iGEM team need to:

We then resuspended the pellet in minimal LB and poured into separate 50 ml tubes. We then spun these tubes down at 4500 rpm for 10 minutes. We removed the supernatant and weighed the pellet. We added 10 ml/g of cell lysate (CellyLyticB), lysozyme at a  final concentration of 0.2 mg/mL, and benzonase at 50units/ml. We then vortexed this until the pellet was mixed and then placed onto the vortex for 10 minutes. We then spun it at 11,200 rpm for 10 minutes in the centrifuge. We then removed the soluble fraction and placed it into a separate tube because we were out of one of the chemicals needed for the column extraction.

We found the chemical we needed for the protein extraction so we finished the protein column extraction today with VV, LO, and SO using the soluble fraction from yesterday.

Once we had our purified protein we put them into snake skin dialysis tubing and into .5L of  1X TBE buffer overnight

We also then took the 4 100 ml cultures out of the incubator/shaker and prepped them for the column purification in the same way as yesterday. The BB liquid culture did not show color in it so we discarded this one and will move forward with the MP, SP, and DM liquid cultures. Once we got to the part of separating the soluble fraction from the insoluble fraction we kept the soluble fraction for the column purification tomorrow.

Created 5 ml cultures of VV, BB, SP, MP, LO, SO, and DM using LB+chlor and we will grow them up in the 37 °C incubator/shaker overnight and mini prep them tomorrow morning. We will then use this mini prep product to perform our Gibson assembly of adding CBDs to all out constructs. We did not mini prep DT because we have to still troubleshoot and get the his-tag to work.

Minnesota,2009,Team:Minnesota#Parts Characterization_-_-_TEXT.html,", the culture growing in 50 ng/ml aTc inducer media did not grow as fast as the others, with the OD595 as low as 0.08 rather than the preferred 0.2. The cells were putting their energy towards GFP production rather than growing, so the lack of growth and spike of mean GFP is legitimate.  Since the inducer is an antibiotic, we hypothesized that at higher concentrations of 100 ng/ml and 200 ng/ml, the cells were using all their energy dealing with the aTc rather than GFP production. We did perform this experiment again but did not see any induction.
Stability
We also examined the stability of the device, which is how the production of GFP changes for each inducer concentration over multiple rounds of cell division. As you can see from the figure below, the device is clearly inducible with a general downward trend in GFP production over time. The graph of aTc concentration of 50 ng/ml again demonstrates the spike in GFP production that we observed at this concentration. This is the optimal inducer concentration for the device.
Unfortunately, we ran out of time for characterization of the third and final part, K091101 . However, we did characterize two existing BioBrick parts in terms of Transfer Function and Stability.
Challenges
A day by day catalog of what we did for parts characterization can be found on our Google calendar on the Experiments and Calendar page. Clearly, despite the summary above, some of these steps we had to redo over and over. Often, our DNA after plasmid preparation and restriction enzyme digest was not very pure and had a low concentration, which necessitated picking colonies, growing more cultures and prepping more plasmids. Sequencing, which was performed by the BMGC on the U of MN campus, provided us with a huge challenge because often, our sequences were not clean so we were not sure that we had the correct parts.
Running samples out on a gel as shown to the right, and specing samples can be very helpful in double-checking the size and purity of fragments, but sequencing was a very important step that really told us whether our procedure was viable. When we received wonky results-- that is, the signals were mixed and the samples appeared to have multiple products-- we hypothesized that this was due to the primer setting down in the wrong location during the sequence reaction or perhaps a hairpin loop structures getting in the way of the sequencing (we gratefully acknowledge John Barrett for his suggestions).

VECTOR
For the vector for our TALEs, we received help from Lucas Schneider (member of Freiburg Team 2012) and Nicole Densch (Labmanager from BIOSS, Freiburg). We request the pTALEN and pTAL – TF from BIOSS and sent it to us on Whatman paper. Based on Sanjana et al. (2013), TALE-TFs are constructed by replacing the natural activation domain within the TALE C-term with the synthetic transcription activation domain VP64.
Figure 2. TALEs can be used to generate custom transcription factors (TALE-TFs) and modulate the transcription of endogenous genes from the genome (Sanjana et al., 2013)
TALENs are constructed by fusing a C-term truncation (+63aa) of the TALE DNA binding domain with the non-specific FokI endonuclease catalytic domain. TALENs form dimers through binding to two target sequences separated by ~17 bases (Sanjana et al., 2013).

Figure 4. RelB2:50-RelE:35 induces an active state within minutes, whereas RelB:35-RelE:35 only causes few of the bacteria to enter an active state. In the remaining configurations all bacteria remained dormant.
Discussion of Model Regarding the Artificial Dormancy System
Model Limitations
As the model only simulates the dormancy for 2 hours, not all configurations have reached equilibrium, therefore these configurations might attain a higher concentration of free RelE than modelled. This could result in a prolonged phase reentering an active state. The activation model has a rather weak predictability, as the half-life of RelE is quite high. This essentially means, that the model is unable to reduce the total amount of RelE, given by RelEtot=RelEfree+RelEbound, because of the short simulated timespan. Thus, in activation runs, where the number of free RelE molecules reaches a high level, the amount of RelEbound is equally high. The problem arises, since the model works under the assumption that bound RelB is not completely stable, causing RelE-RelB complexes to dissociate, whereby RelE is freed. This causes the induced RelB expression to approach equilibrium, implying that the decrease in free RelE is rather slow. It is therefore not only the amount of free RelE that determines the activation time, but also whether the amount of dissociating complexes is high enough to counter the RelB production. Hence, it has no relevance to further test high RelE production in this model, as a high number of complexes will easily be achieved.
Light Sensitivity
One thing the model does not include, is the actual sensitivity to light. Out in the open, the amount of light is rarely an on/off switch, which means there will be periods with varying degrees of activation. Since the bacteria should be active during overcast days, the system requires a threshold, both in the sensitivity of the light-regulated promoter, but also in the activation of the toxin-antitoxin system. Variation of light is implicitly modelled through variation in promoter strength, for instance a half probability of activation translates roughly to a half production rate in the individual bacteria. Because of this, it is important not only to find functioning configurations, but also to investigate the closely related configurations, so that the bacteria neither lay dormant at overcast days, nor make the dormancy system obsolete in moonlight.

Model Formation
Inspiration for the model came from the metabolic pathway reported in the literature by Abia in 2007 [17]. In the network, small RNA (sRNA) binds to Hfq, a chaperone protein which increases the binding rate between sRNA and its target mRNA substantially. Once bound, the Hfq-sRNA-mRNA complex is broken down by a degradosome, a specialized quaternary structure in sRNA-regulated gene expression.
At least, this is how the pathway works in E. coli. A major difficulty is that Hfq in S. aureus does not seem to play any major physiological role [18]. To make matters more difficult, the existence of a chaperone protein for sRNA in S. aureus has yet to be discovered [19]. Additionally, the proteins that make up the degradosome in E. coli are not present in S. aureus.
Our solution to these problems was to simple provide S. aureus the Hfq present in E. coli. In this way, a model of sRNA gene-regulation could be implemented to aid with laboratory design, and respond to the purposes of the model. Since Hfq would need to be expressed in the target cell, the reaction network took the form shown below.
Applying the usual mass action to the reaction network in the figure below, we arrive at the model equations:
Model Reduction and Steady State Behaviour
In our model equations presented previously, if we define the total amount of Hfq present in the cell as HT = H + Hs + Hms, we find:
In this way, the steady state concentration of Hfq is then:
Applying a quasi-steady state approximation on the last three equations in the model yields a system of linear equations:

Implementation of a Plant Biofilter
How does a biofilter look like? To face this question we considered the requirements for a moss filter and took a look at existing solutions.
We talked to Prof. Dr.-Ing. Clemens Posten, who is head of the Institute of bioprocess engineering at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT). So we were shown the institutes's bioreactors and Prof. Posten gave us an idea how a symbiosis between plant and technology can look like. In the past his group worked on a collaboration project with Prof. Dr. Reski (see our Advisory Board ) on biological process engineering for Physcomitrella patens. Throughout this discussion we figured out several important parameters we will have to control and possible problems we might have to solve in order to successfully implement our PhyscoFilter.
Although his institute at the moment mainly works with algae, two solutions became apparent as sensible. The tube reactor mainly consists of glass tubes in which the plant is grown. The open pond model is a meander-shaped pond or slowly floating stream.

The flat disposal of the polyurethane tube guarantees a maximum of incoming light. It consists of one tube with the length of 15m arranged in a spiral shape. A meander shape wasn't possible, because the tube's bending radius is limited. The tube has an inner diameter of 4mm and an outer diameter of 6mm. It is fixated on a wooden board with hot glue.

Nucleation is considered the rate-limiting step in polymerization (Chapman 2008), whereas subsequent elongation occurs at a relatively constant rate regardless of fibril length. Thus, all fibers are grouped as a single species. As polymerization can occur anywhere where the concentration of csgA is high enough, the reactions involved must be taken into consideration in all three compartments of the cell.

Results
In developing our model, we were unable to find a threshold toxicity level for the intracellular concentration of aggregated csgA monomers in literature. Thus, we chose to examine the ratio of concentrations of extracellular to intracellular fibers as a proxy for maximizing our desired product while minimizing the buildup of toxic protein aggregates inside the cell. Additionally, due to limitations on computing power, we were only able to investigate the effects of varying the RBS strength of one protein at a time. The results generated by our model are presented below. All graphs are in terms of arbitrary units, as we are only concerned with relative expression and concentration levels.
csgA
The results predicted by the model when we vary the expression level of csgA predicts that the ratio of extracellular to intracellular fibers is positively correlated with the expression level of csgA, which matches what we intuitively expect based on what we know about the role of csgA in the curli pathway. These results also match the experiences of members of the Joshi lab who work with the curli system.
csgB
The model predicts that when the expression level of csgB is varied, the ratio of extracellular to intracellular fibers is maximized for relatively low and high expression levels, and minimized with midlevel expression levels. This does not match our intuitive conjectures, as we expected that decreasing the expression level of csgB would increase curli production. Further experiments must be conducted to determine the accuracy with which the model predicts cellular behavior when the expression level of csgB is varied.
csgC
Since csgC is involved with the prevention of intracellular protein aggregation, we expected that increasing the expression level of csgC would decrease the concentration of intracellular fibers, and in turn, increase the ratio"

Our display also included bacteria expressing genes for banana smell in addition to plates of bacteria displaying Cambridge’s E. Chromi biobricks from the 2009 competition. Overall, we had a great time discussing synthetic biology and iGEM with prospective students and members of the community.
Biology Open House:
Every year two clubs on the University of Illinois Champaign Urbana campus,  L.I.G.A.S.E. (The Molecular and Cellular Biology Club) and The Illinois Biological Society, put together a Biology Open House. Attracting families and students alike, The open house consists generally of two parts geared towards different age groups. The first section is geared towards elementary school aged children and serves to get kids excited about science with activities like extracting DNA from strawberries. The second section is directed more towards older kids and adults and consists mostly of booths presenting more complex biology topics. For example, a past booth discussed genetic engineering how it affects daily life. As part of the latter section, We put together a poster with information on iGEM and synthetic biology. We also displayed plates of bacteria expressing Cambridge's E. Chromi biobricks in addition to cultures of bacteria expressing genes for banana smell.
Science Olympiad National Tournament:
We had the opportunity to set up a display at the Majors Fair during the Science Olympiad National Tournament held on the University of Illinois Champaign Urbana campus May 21st. This provided us with the perfect opportunity to inform high school and middle school Science Olympiad team members and their families about synthetic biology and iGEM. It was exciting to generate interest amongst these young students and possible future iGEM participants!
G.A.M.E.S. (Girls Adventures in Math Engineering and Science) Camp:
During late July and early August we presented at G.A.M.E.S camp to high school and middle school girls interested in science, math and engineering. We put together a presentation available here with a basic introduction to synthetic biology and its applications as well as some information on iGEM. The presentation concluded with a paper plasmid lab ( available here ) to reinforce the value of recombinant DNA technology. It was rewarding to see the girls develop an interest in and understanding of synthetic biology.

Artificial Exercise
Goal: Use TMRM (tetramethylrhodamine  methyl ester) to assess the ability of UCP1 to collapse membrane potential. Membrane  potential-driven accumulation of TMRM within the inner membrane region of  healthy functioning mitochondria results in a dramatic increase in  TMRM-associated orange fluorescence. When the mitochondrial membrane potential  collapses TMRM is dispersed throughout the cell cytosol at a concentration that  yields minimal fluorescence upon excitation in the optimal wavelength region.
Details:
HepG2  cells were seeded in a 24 well plate (75,000 cells per well) and incubated for  24 hours at 37?c.
After  24 hours, in 3 of the wells the cells were transfected with pcDNA3.1 UCP1 using  Lipofectamine, and incubated for 24 hours at 37?c.
Then, the cells were dyed with TMRM:
The overnight medium was  aspirated.
Three different concentrations  of TMRM 10 µM were added to 4 wells without any treatment: 0 nM, 10 nM, 25 nM,  50 nM, by adding 1 ml of medium DMEM with 0 µl, 1 µl, 2.5 µl, 5 µl of stock  solution respectively .
Incubate for 30 min in  37?C.
The medium was replaced to DMEM without phenol red, 0.5 ml in each  well.
Same treatment was done  with 3 wells of pcDNA3.1 UCP1 transfected HepG2 cells.
The cells were viewed in a  fluorescent microscope (excitation – 545 nm, emission – 575 nm).
Results:
The  left series of pictures shows HepG2 cells treated with TMRM of different  concentrations (left – white light, right – fluorescent), and the right series  shows HepG2 previously transfected with pcDNA3.1 UCP1 as described above, also  treated with TMRM of different concentrations.
There  appears to be no visible difference between cells transfected with pcDNA3.1  UCP1 and the normal cell line. Also there was no"

Welcome Party for Freshmen in National Yang Ming University
By the end of August, the newborn list of all departments of the  National Yang Ming University will be announced. Sophomores of those  departments will hold welcome parties in the northern, central, southern area  of Taiwan respectively to introduce the events, environment, curriculums, and  all kinds of clubs of the National Yang Ming University to the freshmen and let  our freshmen to be familiar with each other.
In Saturday afternoon, August 25th, in the northern welcome party of  medical department, the attendance was up to 100 people, and we got a chance  introduce what is iGEM, how about the development of synthetic biology, and  what our iGEM team of National Yang Ming University had done from 2007 t0 2012.
After the party, many freshmen of the medical department asked lots of  interesting questions and wanted to know how to participate in iGEM team of  NYMU next year by our team members and our discussing platform on facebook.
These results not only indicated that we have successfully achieved our  goal of spreading the idea of iGEM and synthetic biology and attracting the  interest of our freshmen! It senses that we will make more people to take  attention and join the field of synthetic biology!

Biosecurity
The third component of our system is a biosecurity mechanism to ensure the containment of the genetically modified bacteria, a crucial component for any synthetic   biology project. For this final component we have explored different methods of biosecurity and conducted a number of experimental tests to determine its   suitability within our innovation.
Testing the effectiveness of UV as a method of Biosecurity
Motivations
The aim of this set of experiments was to determine the effectiveness of using Ultra Violet radiation as a bactericide to prevent the release    of our GM E.coli into the environment in addition to preventing other bacteria from entering the filtration system.   The idea of incorporating UV in our bio-security scheme came from a trip to a South West Water plant. Click here to find out more . At that   particular plant bacteria were used to digest organic waste. Before water could exit the works it flowed under UV light to remove bacteria    that were remaining.    However the bacteria used by SWW is not genetically modifies and is naturally occurring. As stated above we however are proposing to use GM bacteria and therefore we must adhere to UK laws and standards. Therefore it was important to test the effectiveness of UV light to see if it could be suitable   to use in our filtration system.
Click here to find the protocol we devised!
As part of our research into finding the most appropriate and effective biosecurity mechanisms to include within our filtration system, see link for more information, we decided to firstly test how the population of E. coli changes with exposure to UV. The motivation behind testing this particular mechanism was because it was mentioned in a interview with South West Water as part of our stakeholder engagement that this methods was employed at one of their works which use bio-remediation in its producers, click here to find more information about his interview.
The results of the experiment are as follows.

It is realized through the regulation of the RBS of TetR to an appropriate intensity. The basic principle here is C4HSL can activate the expression of TetR, which can be used to inhibit the expression of LacI. Therefore, the activating of LacI by C4HSL can be counteracted.

II Design an easy way to regulate the killing ability of warriors.
    To mimic the situation we investigate in real world, sometimes we need to regulate the killing ability to an appropriate level, like making the two warriors have the same killing ability. What can we do to regulate the killing ability of the warriors? Our model suggests that it is possible to regulate the killing ability of the two warriors by just changing the promoter intensity of some proteins! (Fig.4)

III Design our E.coli War based on our models.
    We found that it will be much easier to consider the effects of some factors (Like initial number of each populations and spatial factors) on population interactions if we can visualize it. Therefore, we designed our game---E.coli War ( Game Overview ) based on our model to satisfy our needs. What's more, the game can also help us realize educational purpose of our project and make the public know more about synthetic biology! ( Exhibition at National Museum and Game Overview )
    Our game is made on the structure of html5. The two small videos below are our fluid E.coli War and solid E.coli War.

Science in the Swamp
Science in the Swamp was an all-day event run during National Science Week at Centennial Parklands. It aimed to promote science to everyone, and educate people on the different ways in which science can be applied in everyday life. We were able to score our own booth, and spend the day interacting with thousands of children and their parents as they flooded through the park. We set up agarose gels with multiple lanes of wells and taught kids as young as 4 how to load gels with different coloured dyes.
We also had some plates with various familiar microorganisms that we had grown up, including yeast and mould, for people to inspect under microscopes. Our collection of fluffy microbes were also a hit, and allowed us to educate people about the difference between viruses and bacteria, for example, which later became the topic of a contribution we wrote as part of our collaboration with Team Michigan.  Of course, this was also an opportunity to talk to anyone who would listen about iGEM, genetic engineering, and our project!
You can read more about it here !
Explore Engineering Workshop
The University of Sydney Faculty of Engineering and IT held the first Explore Engineering workshop over a three-day period at the end of July. 64 students in their middle two years of high school spent these days working in teams on an engineering problem, whilst also engaging in other engineering activities, listening to guest speakers, and exploring the facilities and technology available at the University. Claudia was not only a mentor to the students during this week, but also was part of a student panel that was held on the final day of the workshop.
She was able to talk about iGEM, explain the project and answer questions dispelling myths and misconceptions about genetic engineering. It was a fantastic opportunity to show younger students the possibilities of genetic engineering, and gave insight into a different potential career path for those who were already considering science and engineering.

Following the form information, the output destination section was improved. The UI dynamically creates a tab for each output, enabling the user to easily switch between outputs on the UI when selecting wells and make edits accordingly. In addition, selected wells change color and can be de-selected before submission. After improving the well selection table, the aesthetics of the UI were redone to make the design sleek and easy to read.
This final version of the UI was received well by users. Given more time, a LiveView feature would’ve been implemented to give users real-time information about TERRA’s status, such as current well and remaining time, during the dispensing process.
Back-end Code
The back-end software runs both the XY Plane and Control Syringes. The approach in designing the back-end was to treat information in the context of a series of different outputs coming off of the microfluidic chip. By creating an “Output” class, we created different methods that were responsible for assigning each output a set of dispensing coordinates and pair of corresponding control syringes that open and close the output. We are then able to access each output to get the necessary information to control the hardware. The control syringe and xy-plane software are detailed further below.
Controlling the Syringe Pumps
The Control Syringe Pump software is responsible for moving the servo motors in order to actuate valves on the TERRA Adapter to select for certain outputs to dispense. In addition, the Control Syringe Pump software resets the syringes before the start of any experiment. It does this by moving syringes to three known states:
Origin
Close
Open
The origin state resets the syringe to reference point, the open state opens a valve by via negative pressure by pulling the syringe, and the close state closes a valve by releasing the syringe back to origin and applying slight positive pressure by pushing the syringe. Below is a diagram showing the various states:
As mentioned earlier, the Control Syringe Pump software works with the TERRA Adapter to dispense outputs into the targeted vessel. Each output has a pair of control syringes assigned to it, called A and B, in order to toggle between selection and waste; selection occurs when the control syringe A is open and control syringe B is closed while direction to waste occurs when control syringe A is closed and control syringe B is open. When dispensing into a well, the output specified by the user is selected and all other outputs are directed"

Invertase assay
I Background
    RafD, which is primitively from the raffinose operon of E. coli, can express a β-fructofuranosidase. It can hydrolyze raffinose into fructose and meliose, and sucrose into glucose and fructose. HlyA is a secretory protein in bacteria, which can be secreted through the recognition of its signal sequence at the C terminal by a transporter constructed by HlyB, HlyD and TolC. This part is designed to produce a secretory invertase, which can hydrolyze sucrose in the medium to feed the bacteria without invertase.
Tips: BBa_K2250003 just contains RafD and HlyA signal peptide!
II Experimental design
    As demonstrated in the genetic circuit, RafD is ligated to the signal peptide of HlyA. The plasmid can also express HlyB and HlyD, which is controlled by PBAD to tune the secretion process of RafD. Besides, TolC originally exists in the genome of E. coli. Thus, the RafD enzyme is able to be transported to the medium and hydrolyze the sucrose outside the cells.
    To test the function of this part, we constructed two kinds of E. coli, one with this part BBa_K2250003 and a transport system (We call it ""Peasant"" to distinguish it with farmer, which also has parts that can sense AHLs.), and the other with a constitutive expression"

Atlanta Science Festival

SBC Speaker Series
Because of the popularity of our Bio Brick activity in 2016 the Atlanta Science Festival asked us to return in 2017 for more public outreach. We provided children and parents alike with a better understanding of the goals, applications and importance of synthetic biology by utilizing the Bio Brick activity and the glow fish display. The BioBrick activity utilizes colorful Lego pieces to explain to attendees how to create a Bio Brick. Participants select a plasmid base, promoter sequence, ribosomal binding site, and a coding sequence to simulate gene expression in various host organisms. This year we also used glow fish to relate how fluorescent proteins are utilized in synthetic biology. Glow fish are technically GMO’s available in almost any pet store.  These fish have been modified by introducing the coding sequence from jellyfish into zebrafish or other embryos to produce a bright fluorescent color in adult fish . We also took some time to explained previous iGEM projects and their benefits to society.
GCDHH
Over the summer the Georgia Center of the Death and Hard-of-Hearing (GCDHH) reached out to our GSU iGEM team to learn about synthetic biology and how they could be a part of the research world. Without knowing how to approach the obstacle of communicating with one another, we reached out to our Department of Education to find out the best way to present our information to the incoming students. Using the guidelines we received, we hosted a successful open lab day for the GCDHH students. We had interpreters signing as we were explaining the basics of our lab and the undergraduate research that iGEM has to offer. When we initially agreed to host the students we had no idea how much it would impact our view of synthetic biology. We believe that the knowledge and experience we gain from being a part of iGEM should be accessible to everyone that has an interest. Furthermore, we have integrated what we learned about the deaf and hard of hearing into our presentation to make it more accessible. As a side benefit, several of our team members have learned some sign language.

expression of NRPS. It carries sfp, a 4'-Phosphopanthetheinyl-Transferase from Bacillus subtilis to be able to
activate NRPS PCP-domains (i.e. T-Domains)[Pfeifer 2001]. Transformation with pMM64 (bpsA) should result in
indigoidine production since sfp was previously shown to activate indigoidine synthetases [Yu 2013].

Sheffield,2016,Team:Sheffield#project#device#microfluids_-_-_TEXT.html," times, one need only add the blood sample onto the chip in order for it to work.
Low cost: a single chip only costs a few cents each to make, so it would be cheap to manufacture in bulk. The small volumes of reagents used would also result in costs savings.
Parallel processing: if there needs to be a control during the diagnosis, a microfluidics chip could provide an easy means of conducting the two tests simultaneously.
Speed: With the small size of a glass slide/chip, the total flow time within the chip should be no more than 20 minutes, which means this is a sure way to ensure that the reactions are within 20 mins.
Ease of coupling to a fluorometer: due to the transparency of the materials, it is easy to connect a chip to a fluorometer/spectrometer in order to detect minute amounts of fluorescence/colour change.
Possibility of automation: reagents can be added automatically and at the right times to the blood sample in the chip.
Biosafety: the chip could contain bacteria and blood with less risk of contamination. It is also easy to dispose of when the test is done since all the reagents are contained within the chip.
Flexibility in testing: it is quick and easy to make and test multiple designs. Each batch of test designs would take around 1 day to make and 1 day to test. Food colouring is used in place of blood and ferric enterobactin solution to test how well the solutions mixed.
In order to determine the best microfluidics design for our project, we tested out different mixing designs as well as the fluid flow rate in different channel lengths.

Mating-type Switch and Mating Switcher
Obtaining the chassis
Aiming to achieve MTS for environmental use, it is essential to make sure that when the MAT locus has DSB (double strands break) cleaved by HO, our type-a (MATa) yeast can only become type-α (MATα). Therefore, we used a Ura-tag to replace the HMRa domain in chromosome Ⅲ. In this way the HMRa will no longer be the donor for the homologous recombination in the repairing process for MAT cleavage. After selection, by homologous recombination, we deleted the Ura-tag for further usage. We selected the target colonies (SynⅩ-dUra) via 5-FOA plates.

Fig. 1-2. As we can see in the gel photo above, the UP and DOWN segments hasn’t been amplified in our SynⅩ-dUra comparing to the BY4741 as control, which indicated that the HMRa gene has been successfully eliminated.

The result for constructing the Gal systems
In this pathway, we chose Gal1 as our inducible promoter for the expression of HO gene, CYC1 as the terminator, and PRS416(with Ura-tag) as our vector. As for segments ligation, we designed the cutting sites for Bsa1 enzyme in each part, hoping to achieve seamless ligation of these three parts.
We adopted the PCR method to amplify the Gal1-part (BBa_K2407001) and CYC1-part (BBa_K2407107) from a Gal1-Vika plasmid we had used in our former lab work with specially designed"

Our Sponsors
Our group, the “KIT-Kyoto"", has looked for sponsors interested in our iGEM project and who could cooperate with its economic aspect. We have thus asked for economic support to more than 50 companies, among which there were not only biotechnology companies, but also companies with a strong foothold in Kyoto. To our enjoyment and satisfaction three of them, AMTEC , Kankyo Eisei Yakuhin , and Sansyodoh agreed to cooperate with us. Furthermore, our university KIT , KIT-venture laboratory , and KIT-OBOG financially supported us. From the bottom of our hearts, we really appreciated them.One way of expressing our appreciation was publishing our sponsor’s links and logo marks on this iGEM homepage, as well as printing their logo marks on our uniforms .

RESULTS
It has been a long journey, yet time has gone by faster than expected. Although we have not been able to fulfill the totality of our initial objectives, we have succeeded.  Since the very beginning, the main goal of this project has been the creation of a bacteria capable of degrading polyamines from its environment. With a proof-of-concept in E.coli, the circuit could be translated to other bacteria and potentially become a commercial probiotic for the prevention of colorectal cancer.
Doing the Knock-Outs of the genes speB (Agmatine decarboxilase) and speC (Ornithine Ureolase) has been an important obstacle for us. Our first approach was to use single mutants from the E.coli Keio Collection (Yale) and trying to remove the second gene with CrispR-Cas9. After repeating the whole process several times, the genomic sequencing of the DNA never confirmed a successful extraction. Moreover, we were never able to grow our double mutant cells in liquid medium.
Since we forsaw the previous situation coming, we purchased the MA255 cells from Yale before starting the lab sessions, which have already incorporated the two Knock-Outs that we want. The inconvenient with those, is that they also require 3 aminoacids in their growth media besides the polyamines to grow, which was a struggle at first but we ended up learning the method to cultivate them.
As stated, the main device of this project is the J23119-FMS1-PatA. This genetic machine is the combination of the regular consitutive promoter and two enzymes that degrade the 3 basic types of polyamines; the Polyamine Oxidase (spermine and spermidine) and the Putrescine Aminotrasnferase (putrescine). The combination of three is a powerful polyamine degrading engine, which we have successufully clonned and transformed in E. coli and that we are submitting to the part registry as the full composite, but also in separated parts. The two genes incorporate the standard medium RBS BBa_B0032 upstream to the actual codifying sequence. Sanger sequencing provided by our sponsor GATC biotech has confirmed the integrity of the samples.
To measure the effectiveness of the device, we have run a multiplate reader for 12 hours to compare the growth of Yale cells with and without our device with a gradient of poly"

Wiki development is a stressful process with a very strict time constraint as iGEM sets a wiki freeze day that all teams are subject to. We hope that you are up to the challenge, and look forward to seeing all that you contribute.
Conclusion - What’s Next?
So what’s next? Well, for the remainder of the Winter Term, Waterloo iGEM will be coming up with this year’s project idea. Anyone can make a project proposal, so if you have an idea that you want to pitch forward, go for it! On the PNP side of things to do, we’ll start thinking about how we want to tackle our medal criteria, whether it’s building off of tasks from last year or coming up with new ideas altogether. The Spring Term is when all subteams really start working on their respective tasks until the Jamboree in October/November.
So there you have it! Hopefully after reading this guide you have a better understanding of the iGEM Competition and what our responsibilities are as the Policy and Practices subteam. We strive to maintain an open environment to promote discussion and collaboration amongst ourselves, but most importantly, we want everyone to have a positive experience as part of Waterloo iGEM. In addition, it is imperative that you have a great summer - it is bronze medal criteria. We look forward to hearing your ideas and input this year, and don’t forget; feel free to ASK anything if you need clarification.
Finally, add to this guide, distribute it to other teams, and make it your own so that teams in the future can benefit from all you learn.
Welcome to the team, and we look forward to working with you!
Applications of Prion Project
The Waterloo iGEM 2017 project is a proof of concept for a system that has an application in increasing the speed of enzymatic reactions in bulk industrial reactors. This highlighted application is in the spotlight as the most practical, useful and feasible application possible based on this project.
In enzymatic pathways, the product of one enzyme must be passed onto the next enzyme in the pathway. In cells, related enzymes are often close to each other and so this is not a concern. However, if performing such a reaction in vitro the proteins would on average be much further apart due to their paths following random walks. This slows the speed of the reaction.
Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that decreasing the distance between enzymes is sufficient to increase their interaction and decrease the time taken for intermediates to move between them. Knowing this, a system that brings enzymes close together should be able to speed"

Increase of uric acid production by over-expressing key enzymes in de novo purine biosynthesis pathway.
Expressing XOR in E. coli
We constructed the plasmid bearing recombinant human xanthine oxidoreductase (rhXOR, shorted as XOR) on a pETDuet-1 vector and transformed it into E. coli, thus obtaining E. coliXOR. We first cultured E. coliXOR in regular LB medium at 37℃ at 200 rpm for 12-16 hours, then added IPTG to induce expression of XOR and cultured at 30℃ at 200 rpm overnight. Then XOR activity was tested by incubating bacteria with OD600 of 100 with xanthine for 6 hours at 1100 rpm and detecting uric acid with HPLC-MS (for detailed assay, see NOTEBOOK ). In regular LB medium, no uric acid production was detected (Figure 7).
Since uric acid is reported to cause cell death, we speculated that expression of XOR in large quantity was baneful and thus expression was suppressed. Therefore, we removed IPTG and counted on leakage expression of XOR. XOR activity was tested following the same procedure, but still no uric acid production was detected (figure 8).
When we learnt that XOR contains molybdopterin cofactors as active catalytic site, we added 1mM sodium molybdate into regular LB medium and cultured E. coliXOR under same conditions as before. IPTG was added in experiment group while removed in control group. We used HPLC-MS to detect uric acid and integrated area was calculated and compared to decide the relative amount of uric acid. Since peaks of xanthine and uric acid were sometimes overlapped in UV absorbance plot (Figure 9), we integrated the MS plot. Results showed that compared to bacteria not bearing XOR (Control in Figure 10), E. coliXOR cultured with 1mM sodium had the exceptional ability to transfer external xanthine into uric acid. The function of IPTG differed regarding plasmid vectors. Control bacteria bore a pETDuet-1 plasmid same as pET-XOR, and gained resistance to ampicillin, while RSF-XOR bore a pRSFDuet-1 plasmid and was endowed a resistance to kanamycin. In pET-XOR bearing bacteria, addition of IPTG significantly inhibited its ability to oxidize xanthine, while in pRSF-XOR bearing"

Today was a busy day in the lab. We began constructing a genomic library for the Strain E-15 EG3, through using transposases. After getting the sequences in from Monday, there ended up be a base pair deletion and a point mutation in reductase, and there was a single base pair mutation in the dehydrogenase. The dehydrogenase was not as bad, as we can use site-directed mutagenesis (SDM) to fix the mutation. However, the reductase will need to be redone. Good news was that the SOEing worked, however!

Ran a gel of the PCR screen from yesterday. We began the second Tecan experiment – varying amount of ethylene glycol for the Strain E-15 EG3 to see the optimal concentration for growth. We also fragmented the Strain E-15 EG3 genome for genomic sequencing. Finally, we miniprepped B0034 + reductase, and B0034 + dehydrogenase, along with B0015 to build simple construct later on.

Nematode parasites cost the agricultural industry lots of money and grief each year due to the many consequences they cause. The economic burden of these parasites is forecasted to increase, since these worms are rapidly gaining resistance to most drugs used to combat them. There are currently no easy methods for the diagnosis of these small strongyles. Our vision has been to apply synthetic biology to the untouched field of veterinary diagnostics by developing a better tool for detection, thus decreasing the growth of resistance among small strongyles. While working towards the goal of creating a reprogramed smart bacteria (nicknamed the worm buster) to detect and report the presence of the small strongyles, we discovered new useful applications of existing techniques along the way. This has made our vision about the worm buster more realistic, which in the future will provide the tools necessary to help farmers make a decisions whether to treat their animals or not.
Our work has laid the foundation for our idea to someday potentially come to fruition. Our novel applications of cutting edge techniques such as phage display and transcriptomics using third generation sequencing provide groundwork for further expansions in the field of veterinary diagnostics.
The Targets
Small Strongyles or Cyathostominae are among the most common equine parasites, with more than 52 species in their family [2]. The infectious stage of small strongyles is when they’ve developed into larvae while still lurking in the grass. While horses graze, they consume the worms and the small strongyles continue to develop in the horses’ intestines, forming cysts in the intestinal wall [1]. When further evolved, these small strongyles can burst out from their cysts during late winter or early spring, moving up towards the intestinal lumen where they become adult worms [1, 8].
Figure 1: Small strongyles.
Symptoms
The release of larvae from cysts can lead to lesions, diarrhea, and potential weight loss. This condition is called cyathostominosis [1]. When untreated, the death tolI can reach up to 50%. During the seasonal rupture of"

Random Walk with Restart(RWR) is an algorithm adapted from the PageRank algorithm and it focuses on characterizing the affiliation between each item. We treat the relation between key words and genetic parts as an undirected graph where nodes represent key words or parts and edges represent connection between words and parts. Imagine there is a walker travelling on the graph mentioned above and each time he faces two choices: 1) Randomly travelling along an edge connected to the current node. 2) Teleport to node K. After a long time of random travelling , the frequency the walker reaches each node represents the affiliation between each node and node K , which we use to characterize the relation between key words and parts. For more detailed mathematical formulation of PageRank, see: wiki page of page rank
Algorithms used in the Recommendation System
Calculating affiliation between key words and parts
We used random walk with restart to calculate the affiliation between key words and all parts in the dataset. The calculation is done by updating the probability vector iteratively ,once the probability vector is converged, it can be viewed as the affiliation between various parts and key words. Therefore, the higher the probability is, the closer the key word and part are.
Here is the Algorithm that we use in our project:
Define Transition Matrix M
Let M be the transition matrix of the graph G with size of (n+m)^2where n represents the number of keywords and m represents the number of parts. The entry in row i and column j of M is 1/k if node j of G has degree k, and one of the adjacent node is i. Otherwise the entry is 0
Note that the first n columns(rows) represent key words and the other m columns(rows) represent the parts.
Prespecify β
β is the probability that the walker continues to follow the edges connected to the current node, thus 1-β is the probability the walker will teleport to the initial node
Iterate over v
for keyword i in 1 to N
Define and initialize v
Let ei be the column vector that has 1 in the"

I have written 4 functions that they all together shift the concentration graphs, so that they work perfectly with division function.
Here is a concentration graph for AI-2 concentration:
AI-2 Concentration Graph. On X-axis, time steps are aligned, and on Y-axis number of AI-2 molecules are placed. This graph shows that the simulation is run for 3000 time steps and started with one cell (blue line) and other cells are generated over time by divisions (red, green, and yellow lines). This type of results provides numerical information about the concentrations of agents and also demonstrates the general trend of change of concentrations in the bacteria. demonstrates that AI-2 is produced and accumulated in the bacteria between each division, however the concentrations of accumulated AI-2 change logarithmic which reveals that some of the AI-2 are transported from inside to the outside of the bacteria. AI-2 molecules then get divided within divisions between new cells, which is depicted by those straight lines in the graph.

Colony PCR to verify LuxPQ plasmid switch (from AC to AK – see July 8) and to verify PQ-B-R-OU-B (July 9) construct
Purpose: To perform a colony PCR to verify the presence of the above constructs. Each Colony pTaq PCR reaction used the BBK CP F/R primers, each with the following similar conditions: 94ºC for 6 minutes; 36X (94ºC for 30 seconds; 55ºC for 45 seconds; 72ºC for 4 minutes for plasmid switch (or 6 min 10 sec for PQ-B-R-OU-B construct); 72ºC for 10 minutes; held at 4ºC. The products were then run on a 0.8% agarose gel (see below). For the plasmid switch, we can see that colonies 2, 5, 6, and 8 gave the desired size of LuxPQ (3.8kb), whereas in the signaling construct verification, we see desired sizes (~6.0kb) for colonies 11, 12 and 13. Next steps will be to isolate plasmid and proceed with further verification techniques on the colonies that appear to be what we want.

UCSC,2018,Team:UCSC#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," most likely due to improper aeration of our samples, which were stored upright with a tight cap in the incubator. We then performed a plasmid isolation followed by a restriction digest to test the identity of our isolated plasmid. Our first digest was unsuccessful, which we hypothesized was because of the age of our enzyme sample. Our next digest, performed with our most recently acquired enzyme, showed the expected band pattern after altering the contrast on the gel image. We also attempted a PCR linearization of our amplified plasmid which was unsuccessful. Through these experiments we learned how to better analyze gel images by increasing exposure, brightness, and contrast, as well as proper incubation practices for liquid cultures. We also ran into several issues with budgeting time correctly in lab, which prompted us to change how we schedule our lab procedures to create as little “dead space” as possible.
For our third attempt to amplify out ade2 homologous arms from Y. lipolytica, we instead did a serial dilution to ensure that we were not using too many cells in the PCR reaction mixes. Again, no amplification was observed.

Each year, the UCSC iGEM team presents to the Bioethics class during the second Summer Session. A few team members diligently prepared a presentation about our questionnaires and project for that purpose. Several of us attended the presentation, and afterwards broke into small groups with students in the class to ask and answer questions about our ethics. Because of this presentation, we learned about the IRB at UCSC and how we needed to get our questionnaires approved, since we were technically working with “human subjects” if we sent it out.
Another small group designed a poster to be displayed at the Annual Physical and Biological Sciences Summer Research Symposium. This poster included details about our three parallel experiments, our research, and our outreach. Three team members presented the information to interested audiences at the Symposium.
After successfully linearizing pUC19 and pXRL2, we repeated the same experiment with larger volumes to get more product for future use. Using this product, we performed several DPN1s and clean and concentrate experiments. The first four tests were failures. We used both our advisor’s reagents and Zymo’s reagents. Our solution that eventually worked was to prewarm the 30 uL water we were using as the elution buffer and let it sit for several minutes, in the final step. On the fifth experiment, the clean and concentrate worked but still not"
Paris_Saclay,2014,Team:Paris Saclay_-_-_TEXT.html," que podría plantear estas interrogaciones: hemos modificado Escherichia coli para que produzca  el olor del limón y simula su proceso de maturación . Una mezcla de bacterias y de medio de crecimiento sólido será moldeada en un molde de limón: el “limón” olerá como a limón, madurará como un limón y se parecerá a un limón pero “ceci n’est pas un citron” – no es un limón… ¿o lo es?. Con este proyecto, invitamos a cada uno a pensar acerca de las oportunidades futuras y la necesidad de los límites éticos con respecto al diseño de seres vivos.
Sentetik biyoloji, yaşayan canlılarla ve bizim açımızla toplum paradigmalarını değiştirme gücüne sahiptir. Eğer bizler bakterileri “gereksiz” fonksiyonlarından kurtarır ve kendi ihtiyaç duyduğumuz fonksiyonlar eklersek, bu bakteriler hala yaşayan canlı özelliklerine mi sahip olurlar yoksa birer makinaya mı dönüşürler?
Bu soruyu irdelemek için, Bio-Art adında bir yaklaşım geliştirdik. Dizaynımızın bu sorunu toplumla tartışmak için iyi bir yol olduğunu düşünüyoruz. Bu sorgulamaları yansıtacak bir örnek organizma yarattık. Parfüm üretmek ve bir limonun olgunlaşma sürecini  uyarmak için Escherchia coli’yi modifiye ettik. Bir grup bakteri kültürü limon gibi olgunlaşacak, kokacak ve görünecek; ancak “ceci n’est pas un citron”-bu bir limon değil.. ya da öyle mi?
Bu projeyle, herkesi yaklaşan fırsatlar ve canlıların etik tasarımının sınırları hakkında düşünmeye davet ediyoruz.

Aim: check for correct insertion of cup1-1 into the hag/flank-construct
Since a Gibson-Assembly with the same aim was carried out last week, the colonies were checked by a colony PCR with the primers for cup1-1 iGEM-018 and iGEM-019. One colony was picked from the plate from 23rd May and three were taken from the plate from 21st May. The latter was contaminated with Bacillus colonies. For this reason E. coli was picked and streaked out onto a new plate on Friday the 23rd May. The consequence is a plate with just one clone, what is the reason, that only one colony was picked from this plate.
