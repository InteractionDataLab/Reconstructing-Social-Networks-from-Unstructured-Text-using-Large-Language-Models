LMU-TUM_Munich,2016,Team:LMU-TUM Munich#Receptors_-_-_TEXT.html,"single-chain avidin"", which resembles the naturally occuring avidin tetramer, but has the subunits being connected via polypeptide linkers. By linking the C-terminus with the N-terminus of the adjacent monomer, the whole tetravalent avidin has only one N- and one C-terminus and can thus be fused to a type-I membrane protein for surface presentation. [2]
Both receptor types generally serve the same purpose: By interacting with the complementary component in the printing reservoir, cells are being cross-linked due to the polyvalent binding of streptavidin molecules to polyvalent biotinylated proteins.
The general, modularized design of our membrane proteins, which we designed and created for both eukaryotic cells (such as HEK cells) and prokaryotic cells (such as E. coli) is in both cases based on the same principle (see Fig. 1). The expression of the membrane protein is - for the prokaryotic as well as for the eukaryotic construct - controlled by a constitutive promoter and secretion into the endoplasmic reticulum or the periplasmic space is enabled by an appropriate signal peptide. The signal peptide is followed by the functional extracellular domain (biotinylated or with biotin-binding properties) via RFC [25], further followed by an antibody binding site that can be used in experiments to quantify the surface presentation of the synthetic membrane protein. The membrane insertion in eukaryotes is enabled by using a simple single-span transmembrane domain, while in eukaroytes a bacterial autotransporter is being used that integrates into the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria. Via this cross-kingdom compatible modular design, we were not only able to successfully generate cells for our inventive bioprinting approach, but also enable future teams to present protein domains of their respective interest on the surface of both bacterial and mammalian cells for their own application, allowing them to make use of our optimized transmembrane domains and signal sequences.
Prediction of signal peptide functionality
For determining a signal peptide suitable for our construct, we tested a total of three signal peptides - one taken from the parts registry, and two designed by ourselves.
The EGFR signal peptide was taken from the iGEM parts registry ( BBa_K157001 ) and combined with a BioBrick encoding the CMV promoter sequence ( BBa_K747096 ) via the RFC10 cloning standard.
The BM40 and Igκ signal peptides were designed by us, providing additional spacing as well as"

After attending this event, we all felt that it would be in our best interests to create a permanent platform where we could communicate, exchange ideas, and collaborate.
Emory is having a similar issue that we dealt with last year. Their team consists mostly of seniors who will be graduating. The 2018 GSU iGEM team was also made up of entirely new members, meaning we did not have any team members with iGEM experience, and could not benefit from any mentoring from returning members. We discussed with the Emory team the ideas, concepts and expectations we wished someone had left behind for us so we could cary on better. We both wanted to ditch the idea of the team starting from scratch every year. One can never fully understand all that is iGEM without having done it once before, but there are definitely expectations that can be discussed to help adhere to the mindset needed to do well in iGEM.
China Sister School
It is no secret that iGEM has become increasingly popular in recent years. One of our sister schools, Southwest Jiaotong University, has shown interest in starting an iGEM team, and came to iGEM GSU for advice. Their headmaster, as well as two faculty members and several students came to observe and ask questions about what iGEM is, how we conduct our lab and what our project idea is for this year. One of the faculty members actually lectures here at Georgia State and some of the students participate in an exchange program with GSU, and are here for the fall semester.
Following our presentation, we had a “Q&A” session where students discussed their concerns as well as their own ideas on how to start their own iGEM team. The session concluded with us giving a few pointers on what the best way to go about that would be. We had a presentation that included all this information and shared each of our own experiences.After our presentation, several students expressed a serious interest in iGEM, citing the opportunity for hands on experience that comes with participation.

CIEI-BJ,2016,Team:CIEI-BJ#Description_-_-_TEXT.html,"; Wang and Wu, 2010). All abietanoid diterpenes are derived from isopentenl diphosphate (IPP) and one of its isomers (Withers and Keasling, 2007). Two pathways, the mevalonate (MVA) pathway and the deoxyxylulose-5-phosphate (DXP) pathway, are involved in the synthesis of IPP (Lange et al., 2000). IPP will be converted to Geranylpyrophosphate (GPP), which marks the start of the downstream biosynthesis of tanshinone. At least five enzymes involved in this part of the pathway have been identified: SmFPS, SmGGPPS, SmCPS, SmKSL and SmCYP76AH1. SmFPS converts GPP to farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP), and SmGGPPS converts FPP to geranylgeranylpyrophosphate (GGPP) (Liu et al., 2015). SmCPS then converts GGPP into copalyl diphosphate (CPP), which is converted by SmKSL into miltiradiene (Wang and Wu, 2010). Another enzyme, SmCYP76AH1 converts miltiradiene into ferruginol. The rest of the biosynthetic pathway remains unclear, though a number of speculations have been made (Yang, 2013). What is known for certain is that SmCPS is one of the most important key enzymes involved in synthesis of tanshinone (Figure 1). Without them, the synthesis of tanshinone would not have been possible.

Our objective
Our objectives: SmCPS1 and the Artificial Synthesis of Tanshinone
Our project aims to synthesize the enzyme SmCPS1, the first and most important enzyme involved in synthesis of tanshinone. By combining various BioBricks and the gene SmCPS1, we designed the following gene circuit to synthesize SmCPS1 in E. coli. If the synthesis is successful, it will provide a better understanding of the tanshinone synthesis process in Salvia miltiorrhiza, and the enzymes we produced would contribute to the artificial production of tanshinone. Implications for the drug industry would include an increased purity, a reduced production time and a lower cost. With the help of this cheap and purified product of tanshin"

SDU-Denmark,2017,Team:SDU-Denmark_-_-_TEXT.html," of Promoters with Different Production Rates on RelE Expression
During the implementation of RelE, gene expression was simulated for promoters with different strengths, which were chosen through an iterative process. Promoters with production rates of 3.5 and 10.5 molecules per minute, both induce dormancy rather slowly, with the latter inducing dormancy in approximately 50 minutes. In cells cloned with a promoter producing 35 molecules per minute, the cells will enter dormancy in about 10 minutes, while promoters producing 105 and 350 molecules per minute both have a negligible timeframe. In the simulated dormancy system, the three strongest promoters exhibited similar results, indicating that a certain threshold value had been transcended. This means, that not only was the gene expression disproportional to the promoter strength, but the risk of overshooting was also increased tremendously.
Figure 1. The increase of free RelE molecules in E. coli cells, after activation of the artificial RelE production, shown logarithmically. The condition for induced dormancy is an amount of free RelE molecules around tens of copies. The three highest levels of RelE production, correlating with the highest promoter strengths, show little difference in the time at which dormancy occurs. When the RelE production is set to 10.5 molecules per minute, dormancy is induced more slowly and stabilises at lower concentrations. The lowest RelE production value does not trigger dormancy, and has only little effect on the system.
RelB is Required for Activation of Bacteria after Dormant State
If RelB was not expressed, the bacteria remained dormant for hours after RelE production had ceased, making it clear, that production of the antitoxin RelB was necessary for activation. Considering the stability of RelE in non-growing conditions, it was not surprising to find that RelB production would be the primary element in sequestering free RelE.
Figure 2. The logarithmic plots shows that the decrease in free RelE in dormant bacteria is low without artificial expression of RelB. None of the simulated bacteria reentered an active state within the modelled time.
Appropriate Ratio of RelE and RelB Expression is Essential
Different expression rates of RelB were combined with production rates of RelE at 35 and 100 molecules per minute, corresponding to relatively medium and strong expression levels respectively. This revealed that variation in RelB had a higher impact on the time required before the dormant state was reached when the RelE production is lowered. Out of the established configurations, the RelB2:50-RelE:35 configuration showed promising results."

Assuming stationary messenger and protein content during the cell cycle,  $\frac{d N_{mRNA} }{dt}=0$ and $\frac{d N_{Pr} }{dt}=0$, we get
$$ \begin{equation} N_{Pr}  = \frac{ r_T \cdot r_P }{ \lambda_{mRNA}\cdot \lambda_{Pr} } P . \end{equation} $$
This equation describes the amount of total synthesized protein as a function of calculable rates and the number of free plasmids. It can be easily shown that, after many generations, the mean number of proteins per cell is 1.5 times the protein production during a cell cycle.

The expression level of our heterologous gene can be calculated by equations 1 and 2. Our main goal is to find which of the terms will change most     significantly with the different stress factors. We are interested in the activity in comparison to a reference one, which we take as the activity of E. coli bacteria grown on the LB medium at 38.7 oC, pH 7, 1% of NaCl, no UV irradiation and 1 atm of pressure.

Transcription rate
Among several factors, we will first discuss the transcription rate. In the range of temperatures (or pH) that we have studied, the polymerase (RNAP) is     sufficiently stable to assume that the elongation rate is not affected and the interaction energies RNAP-promoter do not change significantly (for example, the promoter     specific interaction only changes 16%, from 33 oC to 44"

Soll et al had demonstrated successful cloning of AOX from Arabidopsis into E. coli. However, Arabidopsis does not use AOX as a significant source of heat generation. As Georgia Tech’s inaugural iGEM team, we chose to clone the AOX gene from Voodoo lily into bacteria because the AOX pathway plays an important role in thermogenesis in this plant species. Previous work done by the UCSF iGEM team of 2005 helped us determine hyBb as an optimal cold-shock promoter for our experiments.  We would like to thank our advisors Dr. Gaucher, Dr. Weitz, Dr. Styczynski, Dr. Cole and graduate  mentors Richard In-Ho Joh, Ryan Randall, and Catherine Rivet.

The most powerful cause of alienation in the contemporary world resides in this failure to understand the machine, which is not caused by the machine but by the non-understanding of its nature and its essence, by its absence from the world of meanings, and by its omission from the table of values and concepts that are part of culture.”

For example we change our car when it is old-fashioned! And there lies evil. Evil is the fact that at a definite time the object is not known according to […] its temporal lines of evolution, that means the object is not known as it should by the users. Besides, that drives producers, voluntarily or involuntarily, to shroud the technical object with advertisement or appearances that conceal its essential reality.”
Gilbert Simondon, On the Mode of Existence of Technical Objects, unpublished in English. Translated from French.
For Simondon we are collectively responsible for being alienated: we refuse to consider technique properly. Then producers have to use artificial ways to seduce consumers, even if they would not want to. They exploit, willingly or not, the global lack of technical culture. Thus Simondon thinks that advertisement would not exist if we could understand technical objects beyond their aesthetics: we should be able to rationally evaluate the technical pertinence of an object. Alienation is due to the exclusion of technique from the general culture. Nonetheless the advertisement strategy can backfire: in the case of GMOs for agriculture, too much bad advertisement aiming to justify unnecessary GMOs resulted in increasing the defiance against all genetically modified beings (at least in France and some other European countries). This is due to the fact that, if people globally lack technical culture to understand and consider technical objects for what they really are, they are not stupid. They understand pretty well when a producer abusively uses artificial strategies to sell a product, particularly concerning biotechnologies, that have intrinsic risks.

BTI High School Teachers
Cornell’s Boyce Thompson Institute for Plant Research (BTI) studies plants at the genetic and molecular level in order to understand and improve crop efficiency for human needs. They embody a strong sense of environmental responsibility, and as such, hosted the Bioenergy and Bioproducts Education Programs (BBEP) Master Teachers Workshop this year. BBEP equips high school science teachers with the resources to educate their students on sustainability and biologically-based industrial processes.
Our presentation encompassed the use of synthetic biology as a tool for monitoring byproducts of industrial processes and providing safer alternatives for sustainable development. We pass this information to teachers in the hope that they will inspire their students to think deeply about synthetic biology as a legitimate asset in facing the forthcoming economic and environmental issues of the day.
CIBT High School Teachers
The Cornell Institute for Biology Teachers (CIBT) is an annual workshop that allows current high school biology teachers to delve into lab techniques and new advances in biotechnology, and then take that experience back to the classroom. We contributed to this mission by giving a presentation and lab tour, introducing the teachers to synthetic biology, its applications to the real world, and resources available to further explore and develop interest in synthetic biology.
The combination of knowledge, enthusiasm, and experience that characterizes high school biology teachers renders them the perfect audience for critically assessing synthetic biology ideas, evaluating human practices concerns, and fostering a chain of lasting impacts upon future scientists and engineers. By targeting teachers, we hope to disseminate knowledge of and interest in synthetic biology to the coming generations.

In addition modified primers were used to add the SacⅠ restriction site at the 5` terminus and the SphⅠ at the 3´ terminus of the PCR product. The presence and size of the PCR product was checked by agarose gel electrophoresis. pSMF2.1-has2 plasmid was digested with SacⅠ and SphⅠ for cloning UDP-glcDH and also checked by agarose gel electrophoresis (fig.7). A specific band could be detected at a size of 1382 bp indicating a proper PCR amplification of UDP-glcDH gene (fig.7). The restriction of pSMF2.1-has2 plasmid with SacⅠ and SphⅠ resulted in a linearised plasmid.
Figure 7:  Amplification of UDP-glcDH from genomic DNA of B. megaterium and restriction of pSMF2.1-has2 plasmid with SacⅠ and SphⅠ. A specific band is visible at 1382 bp. The size of this PCR product corresponds to the expected length of UDP-glcDH gene. The restriction of pSMF2.1-has2 plasmid with SacⅠ and MluⅠ shows the restricted plasmid at 8203 bp.
Lane 1: PCR product UDP-glcDH (SacⅠ/SphⅠ) (1382 bp)
Lane 2: pSMF2.1-has2 (SacⅠ/SphⅠ)
The next step was the ligation of the restricted pSMF2.1-has2 plasmid with the amplified and digested UDP-glcDH gene. As demonstrated in figure 8 the ligation was efficient because a shift in pSMF2.1-has2 plasmid size and a weaker insert band could be detected. However, the ratio of UDP-glcDH insert and pSMF2.1-has2 plasmid appeared not to be optimal due to a visible band at about 2750 bp resulting from a ligation of the insert UDP-glcDH (1382 bp) with itself.

Wageningen_UR,2016,Team:Wageningen UR#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," which describes the data of Ohlendorf et al 1 . With this model, we now know where to look for the relative kinetic rates in the parameter space to give suggestions to the wet-lab on how to build a functioning optogenetic kill switch. Our differential equations of pDusk and pDawn can also be used by future iGEM teams to mathematically describe and build new optogenetic tools.
Light On
Modeling The Optogenetic Tool
For the first part of our analysis, we optimized the mathematical models of pDusk and pDawn using published data 1 . For now, we ignored the toxin-antitoxin system. This gave us the option to construct our scoring function to evaluate both systems simultaneously with a weighted means approach.
By constructing an accurate model of the optogenetic part of our overall kill switch system, we are confident that we are mathematically representing the behavior of the microorganism in the lab. Results from the model can then be used as a reference point for building the toxin-antitoxin system into the kill switch model. We will search the parameter space to identify parameter sets which fit the data given by Ohlendorf et al 1 . In addition, we will select the best fit to data based on a scoring function as described by Raue et al 4 . Lastly, we provide a mathematical model which can be used by future iGEM teams to build new optogenetic tools.
System Design
We first studied the pDusk system in more detail to derive simplified equations which can describe the system behavior. The genetic switches are based on the interactions between the light sensing protein YF1 and the response regulator FixJ as described by Möglich et al 2 . In darkness YF1 phosphorylates FixJ, which in turn activates the promoter pFixK2. This activation leads to the expression of the desired genes. Under light conditions YF1 enters an excited light-state, which inhibits the phosphorylation of FixJ. In addition, it prevents the activation of the pFixK2 promoter and thus represses the target genes in Figure 11 for pDusk.

The pDawn system functions in the same way as the pDusk system, with the addition of λ cI being expressed depending on the activity of the pFixK2 promoter. The protein form of λ cI"

The result is shown in Fig.8.
Fig.8. The expression intensity of MerR significantly determines the threshold of sensitivity to mercury (II). Five representative lines are selected and it can be seen that the thresholds have varied apparently. The letter in the bracket after the promoter name denotes the backbone (pSB3K3 or pSB1A2) where Pc-RBS-merR was cloned. The deeper the colour, the stronger the expression level of MerR is, leading to a higher threshold.
The sensitivity of PmerT under different MerR concentrations can be denoted by mercury threshold concentration at which reporter (GFP) expression emerges. Data demonstrates that cells with different MerR intensity exhibited correspondingly different sensitivity to mercury, indicating that the stronger the expression level of MerR is, a higher threshold is represented.

This part, PmerT, is a promoter from Tn21 mercury resistance (mer) operon. The mer operon of Tn21 consists of two tightly overlapped, divergently oriented promoters – Pr and Ptpad.(Park, Wireman et al. 1992). Pr is the promoter of the regulatory protein gene, merR, and Ptpcad is for the transcription of the structural gene – merPTAD. They are called merOP as a whole.
merOP is bound by MerR, a regulatary protein, as a homodimer and the occupancy of Ptpad by RNA polymerase is enhanced regardless of the presence of Hg(II), although only after Hg(II)’s binding can the dimer stop preventing the formation of the open complex by RNA polymerase(Fig.1).

Monooxygenase (Part K343001)
General use
This BioBrick poses no treat to the welfare of people working with it, as long as this is done in at least a level 1 safety lab by trained people. No special care is needed when working with this BioBrick.
Potential pathogenicity
The BioBrick’s product is not in itself toxic, but we do not recommend using this BioBrick for any type of system in humans or animals for the following reasons:
Retinoic acid, which retinal can degrade into, can affect gene expression and function of almost any cell, including cells of the immune system; it also plays a fundamental role in cellular functions by activating nuclear receptors ( 1 ).
Vitamin A toxicity can lead to hepatic congestion and fibrosis ( 2 ).
Vitamin A and its derivatives have been implicated as chemopreventive and differentiating agents in a variety of cancers ( 3 ).
These effects are not directly associated with the enzyme itself, but have been observed in humans. It is highly unlikely that high enough doses can be reached with this BioBrick. Please see references for more information about the diseases.
The BioBrick has many homologs that have the same function as this BioBrick and is highly conserved in bacteria and eukaryotes. The BioBrick does not affect the immune system in humans.
Environmental impact
To our knowledge, retinal should not play a significant role in environmental processes or would disrupt natural occurring symbiosis.
The BioBrick should not increase its host’s ability to spread, survive outside the laboratory, and will most likely decrease its ability to replicate.
Beta-carotene monooxygenase is found in a wide variety of different bacteria, insects and animals ( 4 ). As such we would be cautious as to letting a system containing this BioBrick into the wild, since it's function might conflict with existing systems. On the other hand, one might argue that since its function is already available in nature, the function is widely available.
The product of the BioBrick, retinal, also plays an important function in nature and animals. For this reason we fell that the BioBrick could be used in controlled settings, but not in the wild.
Possible malign use
There is not reason to believe this BioBrick could be used for malign uses; it does not increase the hosts ability to vaporize, create spores, regulate the immunesystem or should be pathogenic.

Tianjin,2011,Team:Tianjin#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," the composite mechanism. Therefore, there is plainly a tendency that system biology, as well as synthetic biology in which varieties of “Omics” (proteomics, metabolomics, genomics, transcriptomics etc,.) is integrated, would become an advanced high-throughput technology to shed light on the key mechanism. We should regard the yeast cell as an entity and a system, and look into the overall comnination of the metabolite network, rather than several isolated genes and pathways. Following this discipline, we finally settled our target at TOR pathway.
The core of our project is the reconstruction of TOR (target of rapamycin) pathway, which is the core of yeast signaling transduction network. TOR protein is a central node of signaling network, and is involved in massive physiological processes, such as cell growth and nutrient uptake, etc. One of the most significant clues that relate TOR to the resistance of inhibitors is transcriptional profiling. Different “omics” analysis results revealed that expressions of TOR-relevant genes, RNAs and proteins differ greatly between tolerant strains to parental ones. The following heat map reveals that transcriptions of the Atg proteins in tolerant strains discriminate dramatically from parental ones in the presence of inhibitors.
Atg proteins are the key players involved in autophagy. While TORC1 is a generally-known negative regulator of autophagy whose activity controls the phosphorylation status of Atg13. When TORC1 is active (inhibitors absent), Atg13 is hyperphosphorylated, whereas rapamycin addition induces a rapid dephosphorylation of Atg1. The latter apparently stimulates the affinity of Atg13 for Atg1 and promotes Atg1–Atg13 complex formation which is a requirement for autophagy. It is possible that PP2A (a downstream substrate of TORC1) is involved in TORC1-dependent regulation of Atg13 phosphorylation, since it was recently shown that autophagy is negatively regulated by the Tap42-PP2A pathway (a major way for TORC1 to regulate nutrients uptake and amino acids synthesis). Another strong evidence which links TOR to the allergy to FAP is the comparison between growth curves of deletion strains and parental ones. In the following image, several deletion strains lacking the gene of some transcriptional factor, such as msn2/4, rtg1/2, gln3, gcn2, crf1 and so on.
As shown above, the growth rate of original strain differs greatly from deletion strains, especially with the presence of FAP. However, some of the deletion effects are negative,"
NYU-AD,2016,Team:NYU-AD#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," Madras project on spreading awareness related to the toxic effects of Shiga Toxin in developing countries, the NYU-AD iGEM team decided to build a portable device that would detect the presence of Shiga Toxin in street food, especially in meat products. Furthermore, we also made a brochure outlining information related to the potency of the Shiga Toxin. Whereas the IIT Madras team focused on expressing an anti-toxin against the deadly Shiga Toxin and tried to target the mechanism by which the Shiga Toxin is formed in E.coli, the NYU-AD iGEM team took a giant leap ahead by incorporating the practices of synthetic biology into the real world. We designed the various aspects of our project so that the prototype could be as user-friendly as possible. Furthermore, we also reduced the time for each individual step in the process to ensure that the detection could take place as quickly as possible. For instance, we used the zinc-stain, which takes 15 minutes compared to other staining techniques which usually take around an hour.

Nanjing_NFLS,2017,Team:Nanjing NFLS#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html," shared our project findings to teachers as well as our fellow classmates. We also took the opportunity to familiarize them with the concepts of bioremediation and synthetic biology, and how the two fields could interact. Our presentation received good feedback from students and teachers, so we did it again for Junior high students in our school.
We also organized small discussion sessions among interested high school students, sharing our new knowledge about the synthetic biology discipline among our club members. Our topic ranged from advance in biotechnology to ethical and socio-economic issues that may be influenced by such advance.
Inter-school Lecture
Besides holding presentations and seminars within our own school community, we thought it would be a great idea to spread our knowledge to people outside our age group. Accordingly, we went to Chibi Road Primary School and gave a lecture. Considering our audience’s age, we chose to talk about general pollution types and basic knowledge about biology. The lecture was well received and we were proud to arouse the would-be engineers’ interest in biology and environmental science.
Social Media
This year, to reach out to more people than we did last year, we started to run a WeChat official account (Chinese equivalent to Facebook instant articles). We utilized the platform to update our work progress, conduct online surveys, and share facts and knowledge about iGEM community and synthetic biology. As we didn’t have enough experience in running official accounts before, Team SMS_Shenzhen mentored us about the process and gave us advice on what areas to focus. See some of our updated articles!

Shenzhen_SFLS,2016,Team:Shenzhen SFLS#HUMAN PRACTICES_-_-_TEXT.html,"7th and 8th. Hundreds of students took part in our presentation.
    To start off, we gave a brief introduction of iGEM and synthetic biology together with our bonus gifts for answering questions---antibiotic free mediums that were aimed to attract more attentive participation of the audience. And this really worked out! The video recorded before and a short clip we cut from Lucy was used to put forward our topic as well. After that, we laid emphasis on our project description. We felt responsible to let these students realize the serious current situation involving HCV accurately so that he or she and people close to them will be prevented from being infected with the diseases. During the process, we implied role-play into our presentation to make it easier to understand and remember, which also won us warm applause and a hall full of laughter.
    After the presentation, some audience huddled up around us and continued to raise lots of inspiring questions about our project and synthetic biology as well. We were so glad to witness the great interest being triggered from the youth and their critical thus creative way of thinking.
    To sum up, not only did we gain a valuable experience of spreading our ideas, but also the key to the splendid world of biology has given to our younger alum.

Meetup
    In the intention of reaching out to other high school teams in China, our team organized a meetup located in our campus on August 1st.
    We started sending out invitation in June, and almost all of the high school teams in the Southeast China responded. However, just a week before the meetup, some teams suddenly turned down our invitation, therefore not as much teams showed up as we expected, mainly for financial issues. At last, Team JNFLS_China arrived in time as they promised. Despite lots of difficulties we've been through, the result turned out to be satisfying.
    The meeting started with each team drawing a picture illustrating about their experience during iGEM participation. Then, we demonstrated our project one by one. Our team surprisingly found that our project had many similarities with that of Jinan Foreign Languages School. We discussed the possibility of collaborating on our experiment and learned a lot from each other. Even when we were having lunch togther, we talked and had a lively discussion. We were really happy to meet such nice team whose members share same interests with us! In the afternoon, 3 post-doctoral scholars from CSMedLab delivered a very informative speech about transgenic plants and after"

!
  Biodesign is a graphics editing application specific to synthetic biology for iPhone. It is based on a previous iGEM software named Tinkercell and was elaborately improved to adapt to mobile platform. It provides hundreds of biobrick icons as well as a great many fancy functions including dragging graphics, drawing curves and automatically connecting figures with corresponding arrows. With BioSearch, users are capable of drawing biochemical reaction schematics anywhere they want and share their drawings with friends wherever they like!
  The major graphics editing interface is shown below.
major picture-designing interface
  Since the first version of our BioDeisgn has already been finished, you will find it on APP Store soon!
  We have to notice that an era of cell phone is coming! And since the download times on AppStore is more than 25 billion (see right), iPhone has become one of the most essential mobile platforms. Our core concept is to make research portable. When the development of other disciplines still depends on paper documents or network data, synthetic biology has come to the forefront of the time.From now on, synthetic biology is no longer a discipline limited in laboratory , researchers can take it walking in every corner of the world, to show the charm of synthetic biology to the whole world!

Tsinghua,2012,Team:Tsinghua#Humanpractice_-_-_TEXT.html,"  Tsinghua’s participation, etc by science fair.
For this stage,  we needed a place where people would come and actually spend time listening to  us explain, at least in an easy-to-understand manner, and where we could freely  exchange ideas. This is why we chose the annual science fair as the platform  for this stage, where people interested in science from all majors came to  admire the work of other students and find inspirations of their own. We  acquired a stand and made posters introducing synthetic biology and souvenirs  for those who came to us and listened to our story. We were exhilarated to find  some students who were really interested in our projects: a student from  automation, for example, stayed around for nearly an hour looking through all  of our previous projects and discussed with us all the methods and tools used  in them. To encourage students like him explore deeper into synthetic biology,  we gave them a stage completion badge and told them they were welcome to join  us in the third stage – synthetic biology club.
Stage 3 aims to directly recruit students more  interested in synthetic biology, in the form of a club – the synthetic biology  club, open to students from all grades and majors.
What we hope to  do is attract interested students and give them “a deeper look into the system”.  We recruited some club members after the science fair, and participated in the “recruitment  campaign” – an annual event for all clubs to recruit new members. We also  brought our poster to Peking University during a joint meeting with the PKU  team and publicized there.
With the new  members eager to start, we did not disappoint them: our club activities were as  diverse as they were interesting, from attending lectures to lab tours and  finally lab experiments, As our members come from various majors, students from  majors like automation or computer science may only know a little about  biology, so we start with learning relatively simple concepts In lectures and  group discussions, and gradually move on to lab tours, experiment-shadowing  (following a biology student through a whole day of experiment), and finally  they may even do some experiments of their own. During this process, club  members gradually become more involved as their understanding of general  biology and synthetic biology deepens.
Through this three-stage  plan, we were able to spread the idea about synthetic biology to students from  various majors, and successfully lead some of them into this field. We hope to  see that next year, there will be more students from different majors taking  part in iG"

Caffeine
Caffeine (1,3,7-trimethylxanthine) is a powerful stimulant consumed in large quantities worldwide. Originally found in just coffee and tea beverage, caffeine has found its way into many different consumer products, like energy drinks (1). Following the trend of increased consumption, more and more research into the health effects of caffeine and more economical methods of production is being performed.
Currently, the most common method for the isolation of caffeine is the decaffeination of commercially harvested plants, such as green tea leaves and Coffea arabica beans. The ecological and financial burden of current caffeine production methods makes an alternative approach, such as microbial synthesis achieved through synthetic biology, much more desirable. While significant gains have been made with the microbial degradation of caffeine, its synthesis in a biological chassis is far less successful (4,5).
Rationale
The great demand for caffeine in food products and beverages makes this compound an exciting one to target for synthesis and incorporation in our ultrabiotic. The caffeine biosynthetic pathway serves as part of a proof-of-concept showing that the CRISPR system could be used to alter population dynamics in bioreactors through immunity to phage. By providing CRISPR immunity to a common phage and not to a certain rare phage, the system would allow the removal of caffeine-producing bacteria in a bioreactor through the addition of that rare phage. This has the potential to create a caffeinated or ""decaffeinated"" product. The mechanism of tunable populations is demonstrated in the “population control” section of our Wiki.
Objective
Our goal was to implement the caffeine biosynthetic pathway in E. coli to enable the production of caffeine in a bioreactor. This work would largely build on the previous efforts of the 2012 TU Munich team , which successfully obtained caffeine precursors when expressing caffeine’s biosynthetic machinery"

Motivation
We had three requirements for our hardware sensor: sensetivity, cost effectiveness, quick processing.
In order to get a fast result we decided that our sensing solution needed to be cell-free, because living genetically modified organism (GMOs) in the European Union are only allowed inside S1 laboratories. The main problem with the measurement of melatonin in clinical use today is that the probes need to be sent to specialized laboratories. Here at University Hospital Aachen one of the largest hospitals in Europe, the probes for melatonin are sent 100 km away to a lab in Moenchengladbach. This is both from a time perspective but also from a cost perspective not feasible.
At first the idea was to built a photometer that could detect flourescence. Though this tool is quite versatile, there are many open source devices out there with good performance. The iGEM Teams Munich 2017 , Aberdeen 2014 and Aachen 2014 for example built photometers.
Discussing our hardware project with one of our advisors, Prof. Dr. Wiechert, he brought up Surface Plasmon Resonance sensing as one of the most sensetive methods out there. It turned out to be our solution to an easily operated, cost-efficient and quick Sensor with a high specificity.
There are two parts of our hardware device, the spectrometer and the LSPR. The spectrometer is described separately because it is the tool to measure the LSPR, hence it can be used for every other optical application.

The Pseudomonas Quinolone Signal (PQS) Sensing System
Initial Planning and Cloning Strategy
Building the PQS Sensor
Characterisation
Initial Planning and Cloning Strategy
Pseudomonas quinolone signal (2-heptyl-3-hydroxy-4-quinolone) is a quorum-sensing molecule produced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which regulates the expression of genes involved in biofilm development and virulence1. Expression of these traits is mediated through the LysR-type transcriptional regulator, PqsR . Bioinformatic analysis of the PqsR sequence predicted that it is a soluble protein. Fractionation experiments of P. aeruginosa cells has shown that PqsR is primarily associated with the inner membrane2. It is not clear however, whether this is through protein-lipid or protein-protein interactions with membrane lipids or with a yet unidentified integral inner membrane protein, respectively. In the presence of PQS, PqsR interacts with the promoter region of the pqsA operon, allowing transcription of the downstream genes3. We have engineered E. coli to express this signal transduction system for the detection of PQS (as shown in Fig 1), with a promoter-less mCherry coding gene fused to the pqsA promoter to give a fluorescent output.

Our lab supervisor Chris French recorded the results of some early BioSandwich assembly attempts. Since correct assemblies of the construct described above (PlacLacZ-EYFP) should produce blue colonies that fluoresce yellow under blue light, we can get a rough idea of how many colonies are correct by counting phenotypes.
BioSandwich with OEPCR
Assembly produced around 100 colonies on a 100 microlitre plate, about half of these blue, and most of the blue also yellow.
BioSandwich with Gibson
Assembly produced about 100-200 colonies on a 100 microlitre plate, about half blue and half white, and the blue ones about 75% yellow.
BioSandwich with CPEC
Assembly produced 60 colonies, of which 26 were blue, of which half were also yellow.
Various assemblies
The core team made a number of constructs with PlacLacZ plus other genes. While these other genes usually did not give an easily spotted phenotype, we can at least see how many of them were blue on Xgal.
As an explanation, ""100 plate"" and ""900 plate"" refer to the concentration of transformed cells plated.
BioSandwich with OEPCR

Calgary,2009,Team:Calgary#15 July 2009_-_-_TEXT.html," step, so I had to script the centrifuge to work with different ‘solutions’ and make the test tubes and other components move to and from the centrifuge smoothly. I wasn’t able to script the centrifuge door to close when it was being used, so it has to be manually done by the user. I rewrote the addition of buffer part so that centrifugation is required after each step.  I had to rewrite most of the scripting I did yesterday due to the centrifuge part, but right now it all works up to the steps that require addition of buffer, which I still have to finish. The Linden in charge of education hasn’t replied to our message yet, so if he doesn’t by the end of the week, Stefan and I will visit him during his office hours on Tuesday.
Tomorrow I hope to complete more of DNA extraction (which is taking me longer than it should) . I also have to add variations to it, as right now, it is just the script for a general genomic DNA extraction. These specific variations will be used for the lab missions itself. The general components of lab are just to play around for those who are curious about only particular things, while the specific lab missions have specific goals and completing all 3 will require using each piece of equipment at least once.

Retrospective Notebook: This entry was not written on this day, but derived later from working notes I made that day.
Began working on putting the important DNA part information into the object's names. Briefly toyed with the idea of making all complexes (be they protein, DNA, small cofactors, or any combination of the above) user definable, before determining that this would be extremely difficult. Began thinking about how the Biobricker and its construction feature would work exactly, what types of information would each would need from the other.

  The website ""Registry of Standard Biological Parts"" promotes the development of synthetic biology through providing genetic parts. To expand its influence in data exchange, we found it necessary to build an app client for it. In order to save time in searching BioBrick, simplify the process of selecting classifications, and facilitate changing selected category, we will dedicate ourselves to adjust database structure so that we can change the interface of BioBrick searching into spinner-formed

  As shown in the figures, two ways will be provided to search BioBricks .
  
  The first method is a kind of web-of-knowledge-way searching technique which resembles the website www.webofknowledge.com. A common vocabulary for varied search terms related to BioBricks will be provided.Such terms are browse by functions, browse by types, etc. And users can choose the terms they need on their own. This will provide a powerful search function. The second way is a keyword-way search technique. This kind search is simple yet quick. A keyword is input and a set of BioBricks with this key word is returned. We believe that users can find their target BioBricks quickly with the aid of these two search techniques.
  
  Besides, we hope that all of our members can enjoy the process of preparing and presenting our project.

Overview
General
Environmental considerations
The essential part of every iGEM project is its risk management and safety. As a part of the iGEM community, we took these issues seriously into consideration.
General lab safety
We carried out our project at Vilnius University Life Sciences Center laboratory which has a Biosafety Level 1 as we worked with well-characterized E.coli cells which do not cause disease in healthy humans and pose a minimal potential hazard to the environment. However, all the team members have completed general safety training required for such Biosafety level and passed a wet lab test.
All the biological laboratory work carries risks of various levels to the experimenter. To manage those risks we carefully studied and followed all the protocols concerning safety issues, including:
General lab safety: the team was introduced to procedures in case of emergencies, such as evacuation pathways, locations of fire extinguishers, as well as emergency showers and eyewashes.
Personal protection: working in the lab, the team always wore lab coats and gloves to minimize the risk of skin contact with possibly harmful substances; when using UV light (for gel imaging or sterilizing boxes and equipment) team members wore protective glasses.
Decontamination of materials prior to use, as well as waste disposal: the team was instructed with autoclaving procedures and waste disposal procedures according to the compounds used.
Chemical safety: team members carefully studied protocols to handle potentially hazardous chemicals (appropriate storage methods, working in a fume hood, etc.).
Prohibition of eating and drinking in the lab.
To reduce usage of harmful materials, we substituted ethidium bromide for SYBR Gold dye to stain DNA. Ethidium bromide is known as a mutagen which is toxic upon exposure. On the other hand, SYBR Gold seems not only safer but also more sensitive dye. However, because it also binds to nucleic acids, we treated it as a potential mutagen as"

These components need to satisfy the following conditions: (1) the only code must be recognized by the new tRNA, and has a link-coupled aaRS; (2) the aaRS/tRNA combination must be highly specific for unnatural amino acids in the host cells; (3) aaRs/tRNA pairs must be orthogonal differentiating endogenous aaRS/tRNA pairs(That is not cross in using).
About our Bladder Cancer Sniper:
Methodology
How the sniper was formed?
(1)The construction of Orthogonal system:
In our project,when AND gate operates the tRNA as well as AckRS are desperately synthesized.The certain tRNA can identify and combine terminations codon UAG. AckRS can achieve the attachment between unnatural amino acid Ack and the tRNA. Then the tRNA charged with unnatural amino acid Ack is able to specifically promote a certain protein translation. Eventually the certain mRNA can be translate successfully and output some effectors to regulate tumors growth, motility and apoptosis. The benefits of our UAA orthogonal system is that it can only working in our bladder while unable to interfere our regular genetic system.
Bladder cell specific promoters hUPII and hTERT are the receptors that respond to the endogenous transcription signals sent by bladder cancer cells. When two promoters are activated at the same time , the expression of downstream effector genes will start. HUPII and hTERT promoters only work in bladder cancer cells rather than normal cells or other tumor cells with its capability to identify and intervent bladder cancer cells selectively. The effector genes was mutated in amber mutation, where a kind of unnatural amino acid Acetyllysine(Ack) is added. This process enable the effector genes to continue the translation of protein.

Productive cooperation
Cooperation between roommates can sometimes be challenging, and for natural enemies such as two different bacterial species, it can seem almost impossible. Microorganisms are often involved in a battle of dominance fighting for space and nutrients in the confined space where they live. To reduce such competition, we repurposed a dialysis-bag to create two compartments mechanically separating the subcultures. Mind that the final goal would be to design cartridges to separate provider and manufacturer strains by dialysis membranes, but due to time constraints, device validation was based on a simpler model using a growth flask and an immediately available dialysis-membrane from Spectrum Labs (2 kDa, Spectra/Por ® 6 dialysis membrane, 132633)(fig 3). We utilized dextran blue, a polymer-based dye with a molecular weight of approximately 2 million Da, to characterize the integrity of our membranes. The membranes did not leak the dextran blue solution, and the dialysis-bag was therefore regarded as leak-proof (experiment 1). Furthermore, we tested our inoculation protocol in rich-medium(LB-medium) to characterize and optimize our sterilization steps. Our sterilization steps were successful, enabling us to isolate the inner compartment (inoculated with bacillus) from the outer compartment (not inoculated) (experiment 2).

Finding the right media composition
--- See protocol(LINK) tap for all media recipes ---
The first phase of the project was to determine a suitable media composition for bacillus growth. For that purpose, BG-11 was initially tested with or without added sucrose (experiment 1). BG-11 is a common minimal media for synechococcus and used in Ducat. et al. 2012 (REF 2). No growth was observed across all groups, which lead us to try other minimal media too. ATCC minimal medium, used for bacillus cultivation, was therefore tested as a suitable medium for bacillus growth, with or without 30 mM sucrose. From this we conclude that bacillus grows in sucrose-supplemented ATCC medium, and furthermore, undergo sporulation"

Batch Purification
A new method of protein purification is discovered when searching online databases. Compared to gravity filtration through a nickel charged column, the advantages of this new method become apparent. Specifically, this method drastically decreases the amount of time needed to purify proteins, and allows for more homogenous mixing of sample with reagents added (binding, wash, and elution buffers). Batch purification shares the same general idea as column chromatography. Instead of a column, Histidine resin is placed in a Falcon tube and centrifugation is used to mix and separate contaminant proteins from our Tamura proteins. Instead of collecting what drips through the column as our fractions, after centrifugation, the supernatant is decanted from the tube and collected as fractions.
RESULTS
Our first attempt at batch purification appeared to be successful. After adding elution buffer (250 mM imidazole), we intended to take this supernatant (Fraction 5) and give it the members on the Materials Processing team to try to combine with recombinant silk to co-spin out silk fibers. However, Fraction 5 appeared to have a significant amount of precipitation and coagulation, mostly likely resulting from resin and excess protein residues. Fraction 5 also contained a great deal of thin, stringy white fibers, suggesting that our silk had ""crashed out"" and no longer solvated in Lysis buffer. Fraction 4, in comparison, was less cloudy, less precipitation and coagulation, and more transparent, indicating better solubility in buffer. Therefore, Fraction 4 was delivered to the members on the Materials Processing Team to do a preliminary co-spin with recombinant silk. Refer to Materials Processing, July 9 notebook entry to see images results! Overall, when checked under a UV box and a florescent microscope, our silk glowed green. The silk we extruded with the aid of a sy"

We solved these equations using the PyDDE package in Python3.6 and scanned the IPTG and Arabinose concentrations. Time period and Amplitude was found by using a custom written peak finding algorithm.
Cases tested
Concentration of IPTG was scanned from 0 mM to 30 mM. It repeated for different Arabinose concetrations ranging from 0% to 3%.
To check if our oscillator would work with both the genes on a single plasmid, we changed the plasmid copy number for LacI gene to $n_r = 50$. Concentrations of Arabinose and IPTG were kept constant at 0.7% and 3mM repectively.

ETH_Zurich,2012,Team:ETH Zurich#PABA#Results_-_-_TEXT.html,"il; Right: Construct in acetonitril.
As a control we used the wildtype Top10. Due to the fact that all bacteria produce PABA as an intermediate of their general biosynthesis, we also expect a signal in this sample. In Figure 1 we see a peak with a retention time of approximately 2 minutes. To be sure that this is the peak of PABA we also used pure PABA dissolved in acetonitril (Figure2), which also shows a retention time of 2 minutes. This graph also shows a second peak, which we could explain with the dissolvent. Dissolved in water we get a a single peak with a retention time of approximately 4 minutes.
To rule out the possibility that this peak comes from the dissolvent itself, we also run acteonitril, which we used to lyse our cells. This control showed no peak.
Figure 2 on the right shows our construct, overexpressing pabA, pabB and pabC. We expect a higher amount of PABA in this sample, an accumulation of PABA.  The amount of PABA matches the same concentration as the wildtype. This suggests that our construct could not accumulate PABA in the cell.
PABA is not accumulated in the cell, maybe due to insufficient amount of chorismate in the cell. Therefore we are currently working with an E.coli K12 chorismate overproducer strain [Kast1996], which accumulates chorismate in the cell due to the deficiency in two chorismate mutases. Since chorismate is a precursor molecule we hope to increase PABA output.

Our Journey
 
''If you want to go quickly, go alone. If you want to go far, go  together.''
- African proverb -
  The beginning of our journey
 
When we first saw that The National Institute of Chemistry was looking for team members  to present the colours of Slovenia iGEM HS Division, we thought it would be a great  opportunity to do what something we were interested in and learn something new. We  applied to the call for applications and hoped for the best. Parts of the application  procedure were writing a motivational letter, attending an interview, taking part in a  personality test and, the toughest of them all, solve a scientific problem.
 14 months ago, we knew nothing about synthetic biology because we only learned the  basics in our biology and chemistry classes. We had no clue how demanding the project is  going to be at the time.
Building a knowledge basis
 
When we started with our team meetings in September and October 2014,  we first had to  learn the basics of biochemistry and biotechnology.  Through autumn and winter we have  had having lessons two afternoons per week after school. We learned about cloning,  plasmids, PCR and biobricks. Moreover, we learned how to edit wiki pages, use  bioinformatics programs and data bases. At the same time we were also studying the  additional literature and developing our ideas. We learned about E. coli, conditions for its  optimal growth and bioreactors. Finally, we got to enter the labs where we practiced basic  lab techniques and protocols, such as pipetting with micropipettes. We also cut the vectors  with restriction enzymes for the first time and tested our samples using agarose gel  electrophoresis.  It needless to say how fascinated we were when we were actually able to  see several pieces of DNA of different lengths.  It was a great experience because we were tutored by university professors and scientists  who were really able to explain to us everything thoroughly.
So Let’s get to work!
 
We visited the the company AlgEn, which was a unique exprence which helped us shape our ideas for our project and design"

1) KEGG database
The program ‘Gil’ is a project based on KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) database (KanehisaM., et al. 2014; and KanehisaM., GotoS., 2000). There are numerous advantages of KEGG (Adriaens M. E., et al. n.d.). Above all, KEGG has a nice interface. In an overview graphic, we can take all reactions of a pathway, and see the enzymes that are involved in the reaction by clicking individual reactions. In addition, there are most information about the gene linked with this enzyme. So we organized and parsed the databases that provide information of compounds, reactions, genes and enzymes.
However, KEGG database is definitely not perfect. First, it doesn't provide thermodynamic data. Additionally, KEGG database shows reactions in a bidirectional way, which lacks the information of thermodynamical feasibility. Also, KEGG is a pure gene database. While each enzyme has a large amount of gene information attached, it lacks a bit in the other departments. Therefore, users easily encounter empty pages that do not have any information. Lastly, every glycan in KEGG database is not connected with its corresponding compound. When glycan IDs are not connected to compound IDs, it is not possible to find a reaction with a glycan.
2) Thermodynamic information
Thermodynamic constraint is one of the most important factors of biological experiments. Therefore, the program ‘Gil’ provides Gibbs energy changes of each metabolic reaction.
The program ‘Gil’ obtained thermodynamic data from two separated databases even though they were obtained from the same program, eQuilibrator (Flamholz A., et al. 2012). The first database is composed of Gibbs free energy from standard condition—pH 7.0 and 0.1 M ionic strength. These data are correct, but the size of the database is smaller than the other one due to the lack of wet lab experiments. On the other hand, the second version is made up of values from a calculation. This database has much more values than the first one however, it is hard for researchers to apply this values directly to their experiments since they are not experimentally proved. Thus, additional attention is needed to utilize the second version of data.

OD600 measurements were done every half an hour, and 1 of each triplicates was induced at time 2.5 hours. All strains grew at the same pace and induction didn’t impair growth rate (Fig. 2).
Characterization of HRT2
Rubber purification
To discover rubber, it is useful to isolate the rubber from the rest of the bacterial cells. This will allow us to remove as many variables in the detection assays as possible. The rubber was purified according to self-written SOP0030 - Rubber purification.
The method of purification was based on a literature search and chemical evaluation of solubility of the polyisoprene. Cells were sonicated in ethanol suspension, washed in acetone, and extracted in n-hexane (both steps were overnight).
Two different methods were tested to evaluate the most efficient extraction method. In the first method, we washed with acetone and extract with n-hexane in a soxhlet extractor. The second method excluded the time-consuming soxhlet steps and washed with acetone for a shorter duration of time (15 min shake at 37ºC). Rubber was extracted by adding hexane to the cell suspension, then centrifuging the sample. The supernatent was saved (hexane solution). We tested the methods of rubber extraction on a positive control made from MG1655, mixed with polyisoprene. Both the soxhlet and the non-soxhlet method were evaluated using H1-NMR. We deemed the results to be similar, and since the required time for non-soxhlet extraction was significantly less, we chose to use the non-soxleth method.
The H1 NMR test
We now seemed able to detect rubber that was extracted from a mixture of bacterial debris and polyisoprene, and felt ready for a test of our production system. H1 NMR allowed us a certain specificity and although a significant amount of polyisoprene was needed to enable detection, it was preferred over C13NMR. All samples were run an a bruker 400 mHz NMR spectrometer. We also knew"

Jilin_China,2016,Team:Jilin China#Integrated Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," from the University of Texas MD after his lecture about early-disseminated tumor cells as a biomarker for colorectal cancer early detection, during an international Forum. From him, we know that a specific feature of the apoptin used in our project is that it only enters into nucleus of solid tumors but stay in cytoplasm of normal cells. We consulted him whether the apoptin could be used as a biomarker as well. He said that we should first use nude mice to figure out whether SMMC-7721 cells can multiply in vivo by subcutaneous injection. This part is really inspiring and actually made us changed previous experiment design and we changed to use the nude mice. The result turns out to be very good. Without HP, the interview with him, we cannot imagine how ridiculous our result would be.

The reaction was performed overnight at 16℃ after which the enzyme was inactivated by heat treatment at 80℃ for 20 minutes.
The product was again cleaned up and Taq polymerase was performed to verify insertion. The general sequence primers were used as these should give a large product when a sequence has inserted at the restriction site and a small product otherwise.
PCR conditions were standard Taq conditions with an annealing temperature of 50℃ as the melting temperature of the primers was quite low.

Aim Restriction digest of EGII and CBHII
Restriction digest
For the plasmids containing EGII and CBHII, the enzyme NCOI was used.
NCOI has one recognition site on the empty plasmid, pHIPZ7, producing one fragment of 5.8kb. When the EGII gene is successfully inserted it will add one recognition site, producing one large fragment of roughly 6.4kb and a smaller fragment of 967b.
When the CBHII gene is successfully inserted it will add two recognition sites, producing one large fragment of roughly 5.5kb and two smaller fragments, a fragment of 1186b and one of 766b.

Malaria is another mosquito-borne infectious disease. It is caused by four Plasmodium species: Plasmodium falciparum – malignant tertian, Plasmodium vivax – benign tertian, Plasmodium ovale – benign tertian, Plasmodium malariae – quartan malaria. All are transmitted by female Anopheles mosquitoes. Malaria occurs mostly in poor tropical and subtropical areas of the world. Plasmodium falciparum is the most common Plasmodium in the African continent, which leads to majority death cases all over the world. And Plasmodium vivax is more widespread that Plasmodium falciparum, epidemic both Africa and other areas. According to the report from WHO, it is reported that about 3.2 billion people (nearly half of the global population) are at the risk of malaria. Now, malaria is spreaded in about 95 countries or territories. Due to lacking vaccine, the most effective way to eliminate malaria is to kill the specific mosquito female Anopheles.
Although we have tried our best to prevent human from these epidemic diseases, the global risk assessment has not changed. Hence, what we do now is to discover a suitable way to kill the specific mosquitoes.
3.The Life Cycle of Mosquitoes
Mosquito is a complete metamorphosis insect. The life cycle from egg to adult is about 7 to 10 days. The mosquito goes through four separate and distinct stages of its life cycle: Egg, Larva, Pupa and Adult. Each of these stages can be easily recognized by its special morphological and physiological characteristics as Figure1-4. <p style=""margin-bottom:0.0000pt"">

Sufficient evidence has proven that the Cry and Cyt protein family from Bt., produced as parasporal Crystal components, can be greatly effective against insects including Lepidoptera, Coleoptera, Diptera and nematodes. By forming pores on the cell membrane or inserting into membrane, these proteins can lyse insects' midgut epithelial cells, and then result in the death. However, proteins from both of the Cry and Cyt families are harmless to human,other verte"

We spent a lot of time investigating options and possibilities for planting trees, getting familiar with CO2 compensation as well as looking for collaboration partners and support.  We got in contact with some experts in the field of sustainability and exchanged views with the existing community in order to learn how to track our green house gas (GHG) emissions, how to reduce them and how to share our results with the world:
Sustainability experts
Toni Kiel
Founder of plant values , a business consultancy for sustainable company development
When we decided to calculate the carbon footprint of our lab work, we soon realized that we would need some help and expertise. Therefore, we got in contact with Toni Kiel, a business consultant for sustainability. Since he has a bachelor’s degree in Molecular Biotechnology he was keen on supporting our idea from the very beginning. In our first meeting, he introduced a concept for structuring the tracking of our emissions to us. He accompanied the development of our calculation tool for weeks and provided us with helpful sources and professional advice. Furthermore, he helped us to establish contacts to further experts. Thanks to his advice and support we could actually calculate the GHG emission of our lab work and develop ""The iGEM goes green GHG Emissions Calculator"" that we provide to the iGEM community as well as to scientists all over the world.
Stephan Schöps and Dr. Ines Herr
Dept. Environmental Management/ Environmental Coordination of the TU Dresden
At the beginning iGEM goes green, we had no idea about what is needed to calculate our carbon footprint. In a discussion with experts from the Environmental Management of our university, details and the huge effort that is connected to our aim were revealed. They provided us with contact information and checked whether general energy consumption data of the biology building, and our lab were available (unfortunately this was not the case). Especially in the beginning, they supported us to define our aims in the initiative. Later, they were always available as contact persons. In return, they received our collected data about energy consumption of biological laboratories.

Connor McFadden, UNC - Chapel Hill : Discussed the formal definition of synthetic biology, and the subfields and components of contemporary synthetic biology.
Emma Miles, Duke iGEM : Discussed the ethical implications of synthetic biology related to its applications (human advancement), distribution (biofuel production), and procedure (status of living machines). Also illustrated the importance of bridging the disconnect which makes it hard for the public to accept synthetic biology projects due to lack of communication and education from the scientists in charge of implementation.
There were also many fun and lighthearted activities for all of us to partake in. For example, the Duke iGEM team conducted an interview asking us questions like “Why do you love science?”, “What is your favorite piece of lab equipment and why?”, “If you could say something to any microorganism what would it be?”, etc. We socialized over a dinner consisting of pasta and salad from Olive Garden, ice cream, and a movie to kick off the night.

Along with the iGEM teams of Duke and Gaston Day school, our team created a subreddit to initiate discussion about synthetic biology. Our team and the Duke and Gaston Day teams function as the moderators of the Reddit thread called r/iGEM_Exchange. Read more about our synthetic biology forum on our human practices page.
Building with Bio Revamp
At the Southeastern Mini Convention, we got the chance to discuss potential collaborations in the Human Practices division with Gaston Day School and Duke. Since Duke’s project relates to developing an accessible and easy to use test for Zika in its primary stages, we all thought it would be a good idea to collaborate with Duke and work on revamping the Building with Bio kit for Malaria since it was a little outdated and not pertinent to the more pressing issue at hand: the Zika virus. For those who are unfamiliar with Building with Biology, it is a company that develops innovative resources designed to engage the public with a wide array of activities relating to the STEM field. The kits are assembled by a team of science educators, researchers, and scientists who are passionate about bringing modern day topics related to science, technology, and their societal implications to the discussion table so that the public can have these important conversations. Building with Biology’s mission is very similar to the our Human Practice’s mission: which is to go beyond the laboratory and delve into the underlying issues of projects in a social/environmental context.

$$ \frac{dOutput}{dt}=C_{LuxAHL}\cdot \frac{LuxAHL^{n_{LuxAHL}}}{k_{LuxAHL}+LuxAHL^{n_{LuxAHL}}}-d_{Output}\cdot Output \ \ \ (2')$$
In this equation, the most important parameters are the Hill coefficient $n_{AHL}$ and $n_{pT181}$. Because in the biochemical reaction, the Hill coefficient represents the mechanism of the reaction. The other parameters only tell us the strength of reaction. Because our model includes optimization method, it is not important to know the explicit value of every parameter, but Hill coefficients are still important to make sure the system not change.
According to the research of igem team ETH Zürich 2013$^{[1]}$, the value of  $n_{AHL}$ is 1.7.
The mechanism of pT181 is the pT181-Antisense combines with pT181 to repress the expression of downstream. $^{[2]}$ The reaction can be written in chemical equation.
\figure{figures/Data/pT181equation.png}
$$ \phi_{pT181}=\frac{pT181}{TotalpT181}= \frac{K_{pT181}[pT181]}{pT181+K_{pT181}[pT181][pT181Antisense]}$$
$$ \phi_{pT181} = \frac{1}{\frac{1}{K_{pT181}}+[AntipT181]} $$
$$ rate(downstream) = C\cdot \phi_{pT181} =C\cdot \frac{1}{\frac{1}{K_{pT181}}+[pT181Antisense]} $$
From the last equation, we can see that the value of Hill function $n_{pT181}$ is 1. In conclude, if the all the coefficients in the chemical equation are 1, then the Hill function will be 1. Thus, because all of the coefficients in the reaction of LuxAHL activating the downstream expression is 1, the Hill function $n_{LuxAHL}$"

A Collaboration: Ivy Tech Improvement of Wheat Germ DNA Extraction Lab
This is the first year that IvyTech from South Bend, IN has an iGEM team! The team reached out to Carnegie Mellon University in order to collaborate with us and help us out in any way that we needed. Since school had started up, the outreach duo could not take the time to experiment with dyes we wanted to incorporate into the wheat germ experiment if only for the simple reason that we wanted the DNA that kids can visualize at the end to contrast more against the solution in the tube. Sending out one of the kits to IvyTech was a brilliant way to get results, have another team help, and encourage camaraderie. IvyTech was able to tell us whether the dye should be added before or after the isopropyl alcohol, as well as give us different color examples and the concentration amount needed to achieve the desired effect. The results looked great and we were able to confirm that we want to include dyes in the kits for visual aide and how high the concentration would have to be in order to get the optimal visual. Now, whenever a wheat germ kit is being borrowed from DNAZone, a pro-mega (blue and orange) or methyl orange dye will be included in the teacher’s kit to give to the students should she or he wish to do so. Thanks IvyTech!

Just the same as last week, the presentation group gave us some wonderful speeches about hydrophobic. The Modelling group had made some good progress that they learned a lot of knowledge and they began to design model about plastic degradation. Through the communication with the plastic degradation group, we found that there are also some mistakes in the model, but the Modelling group would correct them in time. All of us believe that our team will be better and better.

The Human Practice group made an approach to many firms for sponsorship. Several companies are interested in our projects, and we have further contact. After the end of this week, we wound not find new firms. At the same time, we have to start planning Human Practices activities, and put forward three or four different solutions. The molecular cloning team had planned to finish the standardization of the plasmid and the expression plasmid, but the experiment encountered some problems£¬the progress of the experiment needed to be delayed. The wiki group had collected some photos and other materials which is needed for the web pages The modeling group continues to study the use of all kinds of software, and to develop a reasonable modeling program

Next week would be the last work week, we have to make adjustments according to the current progress. In principle, June 5th is the last meeting in the near future, the next meeting time is tentatively scheduled for July 12th. Each of the experimental group leader £¬each of wiki group member and the modeling group need to prepare a summary of the work which is carried out in the few months. The Human Practice group showed the connection of the human practice and the progress of the sponsor. The molecular cloning team must complete the standardization of plasmid before the summer holiday.

The conference announced the preliminary plan of the holiday. The holidays may be arranged in August. We should take turns on vocation. Any personal reason, including practice, creating, research summer camp, travel, exam, are not allowed to leave, unless very special circumstances, but it will have punitive measures, such as arrangements to brush all tube, cleaning and so on, and may deduct vacation time. The specific arrangements need to be developed according to the experimental progress. The molecular cloning team shows the progress of the work in the form of PPT.

""Basically I joined iGEM because I thought it was interesting and I saw application possibilities for what we do. I have always liked genetics and being able to do something applicable with such made me really want to get involved. I like all the possibilities available and all that teams have been able to do or will be able to do in the future - it is really just amazing to me. I would like for things like what iGEM teams do to become more common place in the future and actually get more implemented than they are now, and I really care about the organization as a whole because of this and want it to be the best thing that it can be - both on our campus and worldwide.""

""In high school biology, we learned about a chemical called Sonic Hedgehog. It's a growth factor that helps stem cells differentiate and become mature cell types (e.g. skin, muscle, blood cells). When I learned that we could control what stem cells became, I was hooked on biology. I continued to feed this fascination over the next few years by reading anything I could get on biology. In a book of scientific articles, I found one on gene therapy, which is replacing ""faulty"" genes with healthy ones. For me, this was the start of thinking about modifying DNA to fix problems or even to make completely new phenotypes.

Stuttgart,2018,Team:Stuttgart#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," group of the amino acids of the GFP. This side reaction was stronger for protocol 2 (Figure L.3.B). In this case the tyrosine of the GFP was first oxidized before adding the chitosan. Whilst oxidation the oxidized tyrosine residues reacted with amine groups of GFP because no chitosan was present. Nevertheless the connection of GFP to chitosan was successful, too. The GFP band (~25 kDa) of sample after 144 h was smaller and less intense in comparison to the control. However, the protocol 1 leaded to better results and less side products. Thus we suggest protocol 1 for linking proteins to chitosan.
Outlook
We showed successfully the production of a version of TAGC by chemical linkage. Tyrosine-containing proteins could be linked enzymatically to chitosan.
The procedure of chemical linkage can be improved by varying the ratios of the educts. The following  precipitation and wash steps can be optimized as well. To remove remaining solute (ionic liquid) and ease the processing of the polymer a liquid-liquid extraction might be helpful. This step enables also the recycling of the ionic liquid. The ionic liquid is quite expensive. Therefore you can save lot of money and resources by recycling of the reaction solute. Moreover the liquid-liquid extraction provides further possibilities to analyze the polymer (e.g. NMR-spectroscopy). To improve linkage and the features of TAGC other linkers than divinyladipate might be utilized in the reaction.
Basically linkage of proteins to chitosan is possible. The next objective is the linkage of nisin to chitosan. Hence varying ratios of nisin, chitosan and tyrosinase need to be examined for finding best degree of substitution (DS). Besides analyzing the reaction by PAGE, MALDI-TOF is a suitable high-end analyzing method. Precipitation of the generated polymer is an important step for processing. Further research and development are necessary to apply the product as coating.
The major goal for future development of TAGC is the final linkage of all components (rhamnolipid and nisin) to chitosan. Due to the synergistic effect of rhamnolipid and nisin we expect stronger antimicrobial effects.

TU-Munich,2013,Team:TU-Munich#HumanPractice#GMO_-_-_TEXT.html," years from crop’s installment on fields and approve of the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) and the Philippine Rice Institute 8 million children died due to the VAD. International pressure and the scrutiny overlooking to labeled as GMO in the general public leads to distrust. Greenpeace is one of the ambassadors of Anti-GM organizations. Greenpeace’s approach concerning to the Golden Rice project is performed in the following passage.
“Why have been fighting Anti-GM organizations like Greenpeace against Golden rice?”
In general Greenpeace claims no cultivation of GM plants, clear labeling of genetically modified raw material in food and feed, a prohibition of patents on plants, animals, humans and their genes and the promotion of natural agriculture, traditional knowledge, local culture and the environment respected. One reason for the protest against Golden Rice is the initial resulting β-carotene level of the GR prototype (see table 2) which can’t cover the Vitamin A need.  Refer to the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition 50 g of Golden Rice can provide 60 % of the intake of vitamin A per day. Also lack of risk assessment concerning to the unintensive research about how much provitamin A is left after cooking the rice gene and how much of provitamin A the human body ever undertaken is a contact point. The need of available fats which aren’t present in countable amounts in developing countries for the digestion of provitamin A is a second negative aspect. Available and cheep vitamins and minerals from existing plants (papaya, sweet potato) have a better use also for the biodiversity according to Prof. Becker (University Stuttgart-Hohenheim). Another point is that the classic intervention approaches of supplementation or fortification (support of pills and home-gardening) are more prefer that biofortifcation without the consideration about the costs. Greenpeace believes that by combating VAD with home-gardening, sustainable systems are created that provide food security and diversity in a way that is empowering women and protects agro-diversity. The lack of description relating to the biological and biochemical composition leads to distrust. The financial support genetic engineering company of the Golden Rice, Syngenta, is according to Greenpeace to achieve the acceptance for GM crops in public through clever disinformation. Syngenta claims no combination between the project and commercial intentions. Greenpeace sees that with diffrent eyes: Syngenta hasn’t only filed a patent on the new version of the Golden Rice, but also extensive patents on essential parts of the genome of rice and other crops. With these patents Syngenta tries essential core areas of plant breeding monopolized worldwide. In addition to Sy"
