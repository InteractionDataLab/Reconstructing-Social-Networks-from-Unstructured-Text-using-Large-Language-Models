How do Sporulation & Germination Work?
Fig. 1: Taken from Kim, J. & Schumann W (2009) . A: Cell at stage 0; vegetative phase. B: Cell at stage II; asymmetric septum has been formed. C: Cell at stage III; cytoplasmic membrane has engulfed forespore. D: Cell at stage IV; coat formation has started; spore will be released from lysed mother cell.
Sporulation: The Bacillus life cycle can include both classic division as well as reproduction by sporulation and spore germination. In response to nutrient starvation, Bacillus cells form endospores in a process called sporulation (Fig. 1). The “mother” cell forms the endospore within its own cytoplasm. The endospore contains its DNA in the spore core, which is protected by several layers of coats. The outermost layer is the spore crust. The spore is very dry, and contains a substance called dipicolinic acid (DPA), which replaced water to protect the DNA. Until the spore hydrates and swells out of its protective coats, it is resistant to a wide variety of environmental stressors, including UV radiation, toxic chemicals, freezing, high heat, dessication, and pH extremes. This resistance to stressors allows the spore to survive almost indefinitely until conditions are again ideal for growth.
Germination: On its inner spore membrane, the spore has germinant receptors. The spore coats are believed to be semiper"

Main results
Construction of an algorithm capable to generate locks (cis regulation) for different ribosome binding sites (RBS’s) and their correspond key (trans).
Online lock and key generator derived from the algorithm.
Construction of four DNA sequences in biobrick format and pSB1A3 plasmid backbone which encode lock for medium RBS ( K175031 ), key for the lock of medium RBS ( K175032 ), lock for weak RBS ( K175029 ) or key for the lock of weak RBS ( K175030 ).
Assembly of two composed biobricks ( K175034 and K175035 ), designed to test the functionality of the lock/key pairs constructed.
Assembly of two GFP generators under the control of PLacI with weak RBS ( K175033 ) or medium RBS ( K175048 ).
Results
Following the steps of the algorithm described in the plan, an online lock and key generator was developed. Using the generator, two lock/key pairs were designed: K175031 , K175032 , K175029 and K175030 which use the medium and weak RBS in the registry. The predicted secondary structures of the RNA produced by the locks and keys were analyzed using Mfold. Figure D shows the secondary structure of the lock, key and the interaction of both for the weak RBS. It is possible to notice that the lock blocks the RBS, this avoids the translation of the coding part downstream the RBS. When the key is present, the most favored secondary structure is the one where the RBS is free allowing translation. The same explanation can be applied to the lock and the key for medium RBS, see figure E.
Figure D. Secondary structure of lock (up left), key (up right) and open lock (down) for weak RBS. The lock blocks completely the RBS (position 36 to 49). The interaction of lock and key is the most favorable structure (highest dG) and as it can be noticed, the RBS is free to allow translation.

Overall project
Arsenic is a poisonous metal that occurs naturally in ground water and can also be concentrated in industrial and agricultural areas.  It is odorless and tasteless so people can consume it without knowing it.   Arsenic can build up in the body and lead to health problems.  We decided to use a synthetic biology approach to build an iGEM biosensor we call ""Winterkist, Heavy Metal Detector"" that could be used to detect exact levels of arsenic in a laboratory and also have a warning system in it that alerts people who want to test water but don't have access to laboratory equipment.  To do this we made one composite part that joined an arsenic-sensitive promoter, BBa-190015, with a GFP-generator, BBa_E0480 so that greater arsenic levels could be detected by a stronger glow in a fluorimeter.  In another composite part we joined the arsenic-sensitive promoter to a wintergreen smell generator, BBa_J45119.  If arsenic contaminated water is placed with our Winterkist detector and salicylic acid, the combination will make a wintergreen smell warning someone not to drink the water.  In the lab we were successful in building both composite parts and joining them into a single device.  We have had a difficult time characterizing the device's ability to detect arsenic in either way.  We can show in a control experiments that arabinose stimulates the fluorescence of GFP under the control of ARA-C in the pGLO plasmid (Bio-Rad) so we know that we should be able to detect it if it is working.  We have more work to do.

We utilised a variant of both promoters (lacI: K1725080 , tetR: K2442666 ) where a NheI restriction site is inserted prior to the promoter sequence; this doesn’t alter the behaviour of the promoter but allows for an easy analytical restriction digest to verify the ligation of annealed promoter oligonucleotides. These promoters are simply known as R0011N and R0040N respectively.
At this stage, the three AND-gate modules that originated from PCR possessed a B0032 RBS, split-fragment coding sequence, and B0015 terminator. These modules required addition of promoters. The GFP N-terminal was only flanked by B0015, and required the addition of a promoter and ribosome binding site. Promoter insertion was done by using annealed oligonucleotides; this is a technique where the promoter sequence is ordered in the form of Forward and Reverse strand single-stranded oligonucleotides, where the BioBrick prefix and suffix have been truncated so that upon annealing a double-stranded promoter fragment is formed with BioBrick-compatible sticky-ends for ligation upstream of existing parts. The C-terminal module of both AND-gates received R0011N tetR-regulated annealed promoter oligos, and the C-terminal module of T7 RNAP gate received the R0040N lacI-regulated annealed promoter. The C-term module of split-GFP gate received a R0011+B0032 annealed oligo sequence. These annealed oligos were ligated upstream of the existing module parts by digests of the BioBrick prefix, then transformed into E. coli, minipreps verified by restriction digest, then sequenced using VF2 primer. Sequencing revealed that both split-GFP modules had assembled correctly, although maintained the pre-existing prefix errors; the C-terminal split T7 RNAP was also confirmed. However, the N-terminal T7 RNAP module was shown to possess a four-nucleotide deletion in its R0040N promoter (Figure 5).
Figure 5:  A deletion is present in the R0040 promoter sequence of the N-terminal T7 RNAP AND-gate module. Alignment of a sequencing read of the split GFP N-terminal to a reference sequence plasmid map. The bases highlighted in red indicate a deletion has occurred at those positions relative to the reference sequence. Alignments performed in ApE.

Overview of 2013 NYMU iGEM Team Project
To save bees from Nosema ceranae infection, the culprit of colony collapse disorder (CCD), NYMU-Taipei iGEM team has  created the so-called Bee. coli from Escherichia coli MG1655, which naturally resides in bees. The Bee. coli is designed to work successively as follows: (1) Bee. coli continuously secretes mannosidase to inhibit the sprouting of N. ceranae spores. (2) if the bee is infected with N. ceranae, the fungus-killing-circuit with a positive feedback design will be turned on to wipe out N. ceranae. (3) if these designer weapons should fail to conquer N. ceranae, a bee-suicide-operon will be activated to kill the infected bees but save their companions.
Besides, a light-inducible lysis system is created to ensure our Bee. coil only lives inside of the bee. In addition, we have used encapsulation as the method to send our Bee. coli into the bee. Since the capsule will only dissolve in a bee’s gut, our Bee. coli will not wantonly spread out.

Landmine detection and clearance
The assessment of land and its categorization as a suspected or confirmed hazardous area (SHA/CHA) is usually performed in two consecutive steps: non-technical survey and technical survey. Non-technical survey involves the use of a wide range of non-technical means, such as desk assessments and analysis of historical records, to identify, access, collect, report and use information to help define where mines/ERW (Explosive Remnants of War) are to be found, as well as where they are not, and to support land cancellation, reduction and clearance decision making processes [13]. This step is usually relatively cheap in comparison to the other steps involved in land clearance. However, as it can exclude large tracts of land from containing explosive material, its impact is large in terms of square meters.
Technical survey is applied to further investigate land categorized as SHA or CHA by the nontechnical survey. A wide range of methods and techniques is applied for technical survey. The technical survey can be a separate activity, it can also be integrated in the clearance procedure. Any technical survey methodology should be planned such that it provides a very high level of confidence that if hazard items are present they will be indicated. The goal of a technical survey is to identify, confirm and improve definitions of the boundaries of hazardous areas and the nature and distribution of their contents [14], i.e. locate land mines such that they can be cleared or, when no evidence of mines is found, continue with land release without the application of land mine clearance.
The main method of technical survey is manual detection by the use of metal detectors. Most mines have very high metal content can be easily detected in this way. Land mines with low metal content have been developed but these are rarely used. This method is considered relatively save and precise. When, due to magnetic ground or scrap metal contamination, the use of a metal detector is not efficient, manual area excavation may be performed. This process is really slow [5].
Next to these manual methods, which are slow, expensive and dangerous, dogs are used for technical survey. Dogs can be trained to find land mines using their ability to smell TNT. However, it is generally accepted that dogs cannot reliably pinpoint the source of the explosive in a densely mined area where the scent from more than one source may combine [5]. Next to dogs, rats are trained to detect land mines by the company APOPO [15]. Another method in use to detect land mines is the application of mechanical systems that detect and detonate land mines. These machines are"

Introduction of MoDeL based Automatic Modeling Algorithm
Development of Modeling Database Language (MoDeL) aims to provide a platform that enables separation of work between modeling and data constructing. Users could obtain dynamic behaviors of various quantities and other properties of a biological system as the output of iGame while they know nothing about details of modeling and the reaction network. Previous modeling and simulation tools require users to construct the network themselves, which is very hard even for professional researchers. iGame has no such requirements and users are only required to input data about the initial environmental condition of system. Hence, modeling is a task that is performed to find all reactions and species in the system.
To complete the final network from initial environment conditions, we first break up the task to several parts:
(1) Setup initial conditions and environmental parameters read from the input file.
(2) Species produced are inserted into a list in the order of time. For each species, we search the database to find template species which could be matched to this species in structural pattern. If not found, then go for the next species.
(3) For each template species we found, we continue to search template reactions containing this template species as a reactant or modifier or both. Only forward or reverse reaction is handled, never for both.
(4) For each template reaction found, we search in the species list for possible species which could be instances of templates of other reactants and modifiers. If not found, then go for next reaction.
(5) For each possible combination of reactants and modifiers, if the reaction parameter conditions are satisfied, we generate the structure of products based on the transfer table and structural templates of products. And then add this new reaction to the reaction list.
(6) Go to step 2 until the end of the species list.
In the following, we will focus on the step (2), (3) and (5). Our algorithms are totally different with that of other software tools since we design them for the purpose of proving the feasibility of MoDeL for synthetic biology. They are kind of complicated because the complexity of biological systems require"

A proposal of the German iGEM Teams concerning Intellectual Property
During the meetup of the German iGEM teams from 23rd to 25th May also workshops took place in which amongst others we discussed the topic of bioethics. Moral questions were addressed, regarding the value of life and human influence on it, as well as questions dealing with the possible socioeconomic effects of synthetic biology.
Especially the topic of an open source vs. patent controlled field accounted for a large part of the discussion. During the discussion one student brought up the point that the legal status of parts in registry remains unclear and that there are parts (e.g. BBa_K180009 ) where only upon a closer look it becomes clear that the rights are company–owned. The issue that the legal status of parts in the registry remains uncertain is also mentioned in a recent article published by Nature ( Bryn Nelson ‘Synthetic Biology: Cultural Divide ’, Nature 509, 152–154, 08 May 2014 ) :
""[N]o one can say with any certainty how many of these parts are themselves entirely free of patent claims.""
We, the German iGEM teams, therefore like to suggest the addition of a new feature to the parts registry:
A dedicated data field of license information for each BioBrick part.
For the implementation, we propose to introduce two new fields to BioBrick part entries in the registry:
A string property ""LicenseInfo""
A traffic light property (grey, green, yellow, red) to indicate the level of legal protection (unknown, BPA-like, free for research purposes, heavily protected)
Implementing this feature would in our opinion further clarify and extend the parts info, provide a machine-readable format and thus improve future entries. With the emerging Entrepreneurship track and applications getting closer to industrial realization, the legal status becomes more and more important. Also it would raise"
SKLMT-China,2018,Team:SKLMT-China#Project Overview_-_-_TEXT.html," caused by cigarettes does not stop in our bodies or the air; it also affects the land we live on and the water that we drink.
Cigarettes contain over 4000 chemicals, like countless toxic tea bags, which are exhaled and released into the air and the atmosphere.Nicotineis one of the most harmful ingredients in cigarette and is the biggest resistance to smoking cessation.In 1994, the US Environmental Protection Agency defined nicotine as ""toxic hazardous waste.""             The 2013 review suggests that the lower limit causing fatal outcomes is 500–1000 mg of ingested nicotine, corresponding to 6.5–13 mg/kg orally. An accidental ingestion of only 6 mg may be lethal to children [10].
Besides toxic to humans, nicotine is also very soluble in water. This makes nicotine easy to seep into soils and groundwater and cause serious pollution. Moreover, nicotine relased in the environment can damage the normal soil microbial community [11] and affects the survival of pollinators, such as bees [12] . These can have far-reaching effects on the ecological environment.
There are several bacteria can degrade nicotine which include
Pseudomonas PutitaS16
[13]. we decided to clone the nicotine degradation gene cluster (~30kb) and express it in our
P.fluorescenspf-5
chassis.
Because if the entire metabolic pathway is introduced into Pseudomonas fluorescens, it is a huge burden on the expression vector, and the product of the first half of the pathway is 2,5-DHP, which can be used as a precursor of various drugs and can be placed in the environment. Turns waste nicotine into treasure.
Furthermore, we used promoter with different strength to control the expression of key enzyme, NicA2.
Red/ET Recombineering
Driven by the needs of functional genomics, DNA engineering by homologousrecombination in Escherichia coli has emerged as a major addition to existing technologies. Two alternative approaches, RecA-dependent engineering and ET recombination, allow a wide variety of DNA modifications, including somewhich are virtually impossible by conventional methods. These approaches donot rely on the presence of suitable restriction sites and can be used to insert,delete or substitute DNA sequences at any desired position on a target molecule. Furthermore, ET recombination can be used for direct subcloning and cloning of DNA sequences from complex mixtures, including bacterialartificial chromosomes and genomic DNA preparations [14]. The strategies reviewed in this article are applicable to modification of DNA molecules of anysize, including very large ones, and present"

In return, they offered to run a couple of our experiments involving their scanning electron microscope, as the one in our lab is not as sophisticated. After the call, they followed up with research articles with information we requested as necessary for building the model. We hope to have another call to discuss our results and coordinate our needs for the scanning electron microscope.
Survey Revision with Dr. Timothy Chow - 7/19/18
On July 19th, Kaylee, Emilie, and Ariel met with Dr. Timothy Chow to discuss our community survey. He gave us some great suggestions on our survey draft, including that at the beginning, we should include why people should take the time to fill out our survey. He discussed the plausibility of reaching a large enough population to consider the sample a global representation, and we decided we will stick to a more limited population size, trying to reach staff and students from the four colleges in our community as well as other members of our local community, Terre Haute, Indiana. He also gave us advice on how we could shorten our survey while still obtaining the information we’re interested in by having respondents select one of our three implementation methods at the beginning of the survey and only answering further questions about that particular method. He presented us with some local contacts who might be able to help distribute our survey in the community. Finally, he helped us identify the questions that might be too broad or unclear to respondents. He suggested in instances where we refer to “current recycling methods,” we should provide an example for those who might feel unaware of recycling methods.
Recycling Interview with Dr. Diane Evans - 7/19/18
On July 19th, Ariel and Brittany met with Dr. Evans about her Six Sigma class and their campaigns to make the campus more sustainable. The class is geared towards teaching students through a 10-week long project, quantitatively measuring, and statistically improving a policy. Two of the class projects included decreasing the percentage of waste produced on campus by recycling plastic bottles and substituting plastic straws with biodegradable ones. Both projects have been successful, but the plastic straw project especially was a hit. She has been interviewed on local TV networks and had several articles published about the work. She worked closely with our food service provider and they have recently announced instituting biodegradable straws across all their centers. In our interview, Dr. Evans talked about her inspiration, the generally encouraging feedback about projects, challenges the class met, and what the"

To use Firebug you have to install the plug-in first. Open up FireFox, go to the Mozilla plug-in webpage , install the plug-in and restart FireFox. As soon as you start FireFox you will notice an icon with a small bug on the very bottom of the FireFox window. Clicking on it will open and close the FireBug screen.
To find out the id or the class of a specific element on the webpage, just right-click on it and in the menu you can choose to inspect this element. The firebug screen will now show the HTML code of this element. Now, you can either look for ""id="" or ""name="" which will give you a name you can address this element using CSS selectors (see also the following figure).
A typical FireBig screen
After right-clicking on the heading, it can be seen that this heading is assigned to the class ""firstHeading"" and can thus be styled using an appropriate selector

Once you found out the name, you have to get into CSS. Since the appearance of your wiki is very likely to be the same for all pages, we can make use of our template structure that we created before. As the template "".../Templates/Header"" is imported into every wiki page, putting your CSS styling in this template will affect all pages. Just edit the .../Templates/Header page and insert your CSS code:
<style type=""text/css""> body {          background-color: white; /* defines the default background color of the document*/          color: black; /* defines the default font-color of the document*/     }     a {          color: black; /* defines the default color of links */     }     a:hover {          color: gray; /* defines the default color of links hovered by the cursor */     }     a {          color: black; /* defines the default color of links */     }     .firstHeading     {          display: none; /* hides the default heading */     } ... </style>
You can not only modify the framework of MediaWiki, but you can also define classes in your templates and modify them in your global css section. For example, in the button template the link is assigned to the class ""button"", allowing the modification of all assigned links in your global CSS section. Now, you can also change all the default elements of the iGEM wiki. But please note that changing to much might can also confuse the user. For example, you should leave default buttons such as ""Login, search, …"". It is also appreciated to provide a link to the"

Introduction
In our project, we want to stop the movement of C.crescentus to image a clear photo.  So we need to know whether we have stopped those excited boys.  One problem about this is, how to define and measure the parameter of  the C.crescentus' motion?
Analysis
Here we make the hypothesis below.
the solution is uniform, which means the composition of every part in the solution is the same
the number of the bacteria would not change in short time.
the motion of the C.crescentus is random and they can be regarded as free gas.
And we suppose  the distance one bacterium moved in time $t$ is $l$.  Then the diffusion coefficient D can be defined as
$$D=l^2/(2t)$$
As you can guess, we are going to use $D$ to describe the motion of C.crescentus in stead of velocity. The reason is that the object of our study is a large crowd of bacteria, and it is more suitable to use diffusion coefficient as the parameter of the system.
In fact, $D$ describe the diffusion rate of bacteria. It's easy to predict that after we give the signal ""stop"", $D$ would decline because the C.crescentus can not get the help from the rotation of their flagellum and the holdfast would block their movement.
But, how can we measure the value of the diffusion coefficient?
Getting the help from Einstein
In early years of last century, Einstein focused on the motion of free gas, and got the famous Einstein Relation:      $$Ave(x^2)=2Dt$$      where $x$ is the distance one bacterium moved in time $t$, and $Ave(x^2)$ is the average value of x square. The relation shows that $Ave(x^2)$ is in direct proportion to the time $t$.
With this theory, we can develop a method to measure the value of $D$. Firstly we use micro camera to record the motion of bacteria. And then we focus on"

Collaborations
The openness of the iGEM competition leads to an educational and competitive environment which stimulates the advancement of synthetic biology. These collaborations are formed between teams from all over the world, who can help each other carry out their projects. It also enables teams to collaborate with each other to make synthetic biology more accessible and bring it even further.
To make new cloning techniques a little more accessible, we started off compiling a cloning guide for future iGEM teams. For this guide, we were assisted by 14 teams who helped describe 9 different molecular cloning techniques. In addition, we joined other collaborations, such as the Amoy Newsletter, sending out water to York, being a PenPal, having an interview with NAIT_Edmonton and joining a symposium in Leuven. For more information on these collaborations, follow one of the links below.
Our Cloning Guide
We made a Cloning Guide which will help future generation iGEM teams with choosing a cloning method. With the help of 16 iGEM teams we formed a cloning guide with crucial knowledge and experience based tips on 9 different cloning methods.

Science Rendezvous
The Kingston Science Rendezvous is an annual event that showcases current research in science and engineering to the community. QGEM saw it as      an excellent opportunity to connect with people from different ages and background, and we held a booth that presented some interesting science      experiments and demonstrations. At the event we had three stations, the first demonstrated the process of kiwi DNA extraction with household      materials. This was meant to establish the idea that science experiments can take place in everyday life and to encourage parents to explore      science-related projects with their children at home. The second was a microscope station presenting a set of fruit fly abdomen cross section      under the microscope. This was prepared by one of our volunteers and many were impressed by the anatomy of the fruit fly. We took the chance to      explain the importance of fruit flies in genetic research and gave children an idea of the variety of work geneticists carry out. Both parents      and children had shown great interest as fruit flies are commonly seen in households and yet it was rare for people to be able to see their      organs and inner structures. Our microscope set up also featured other prepared slides containing different types of plankton. By allowing      participants to use the microscope, they were able to gain a better appreciation for"

UNIPV-Pavia,2009,Team:UNIPV-Pavia#Existing_-_-_TEXT.html," of ""Ethanol? Whey not!"" project. Anyway, we found very interesting to characterize the activity of this BioBrick and we decided to do it by building up a specific measurement system: , in which we can modulate the expression of the lysis genes through  inducible device. During this summer we have also characterized  in standard units, so the characterization of the lysis device is promoter-independent.
receiver device controls the expression of holin () and lysozyme () genes from T4 bacteriophage. Holins form pores in the inner membrane of bacteria, while lysozymes degrade the peptidoglycan layer, passing through these pores and performing the lysis of the bacterial cell. This device also contains a constitutive expression of an antiholin (), which inhibits holin multimer formation.
Lysis can be induced with 3OC6-HSL autoinducer molecule: it binds luxR protein (encoded by ), which is constitutively expressed by tetR promoter (). LuxR-HSL complex can work as a transcriptional activator for lux promoter ().
Characterization
We performed four experiments on our measurement system () in order to characterize  activity.
All the experiments have been performed in the same conditions in the microplate reader and involved the induction of  with 3OC6-HSL 10 nM (which corresponds to a RPU value of 4.44 [3.81 ; 5.44] in LB for BBa_F2620) and 100 nM (which corresponds to a RPU value of 4.53 [3.88 ; 5.18] in LB for BBa_F2620). The basic activity of BBa_F2620 was ~0 RPU.

A copy of the letter
To whom it may concern,
We are the University of Glasgow iGEM Team 2011.  iGEM is an international undergraduate competition aimed at creating a useful genetic machine and was started at MIT in 2003.  One important aspect of the competition is to consider an engineering design process and to take into account the requirements of people who may be able to benefit from our product.  Our project aims to result in a microbial (E.coli) factory for the production of various small molecules, such as drugs and biofuels, in remote areas.  We were therefore hoping you would be willing to give us your thoughts on some key issues surrounding both our project and Synthetic Biology.
Our project, named “DISColi”, is based on gene expression in response to various wavelengths of light. The controlled activation of these genes will produce three distinct and interchangeable outcomes: dispersal of cells within a biofilm; production of sought-after substances within the biofilm; and encapsulation of these substances to yield a pill-like product ready for use.  Due to the engineering nature of Synthetic Biology the genes could be modified in a modular fashion to produce a wide range of desired products. We would be very grateful if you could take a few minutes to reply with your answers to the questions below which are related your work and Synthetic Biology:
1. Do you foresee our project having any possible applications in your field of expertise?
Yes [ ]           No [ ] Further Comments:
2. Do you have any safety concerns about our project?
Yes [ ]           No [ ] Further Comments:
3. Do you believe there are any current issues which could be effectively resolved by utilizing Synthetic Biology?
Yes [ ]           No [ ] Further Comments:
4. Do you believe Synthetic Biology has the potential to benefit society on a large scale?
Yes [ ]           No [ ] Further Comments:
5. Prior to answering this questionnaire, to what degree was your level of awareness of Synthetic Biology/iGEM?
Low [ ]           Moderate [ ]           High [ ] Further Comments:
Any help you could give us with this aspect of our project would be very much appreciated.

FACS Measurements
2 ml LB media was inoculated with a single colony and inoculated at 37 ° and 350 RPM O/N.
The cultures were washed twice in PBS (Phosphate Buffered Saline) and then resuspended in PBS. The suspensions were diluted in PBS to a concentration yielding 1000-1500 events per second.
Fluorometer Measurement
A Shimadzu RF-5301PC Spectrofluorophotometer was used.
For Spinach measurements the instrument was configured with an excitation wavelength of 482 nm and an emission wavelength of 505 nm. The excitation slit was set to 5 and the emission slit was set to 3. The sizes of the slits determine how wide a range of wavelengths is let through the excitation and emission monochromators. Thus a large slit will increase the signal, but will decrease the wavelength precision of the instrument. The fluorometers spectrum function was used to find the largest slits that did not allow significant amounts of excitation light to be detected at the emission wavelength. A cuvette with pure water was used to blank the instrument.
A 10 ml sample of culture was centrifuged at 4000g for 5 min. The pellet was washed twice and resuspended in 1 ml 0.9% NaCl. The OD600 of the sample was then measured and DFHBI-1T was added to a final concentration of 200 μM. After 1 hour on ice, the fluorescence of the sample was measured.
Gel Electrophoresis
1% agarose in 1x TAE buffer is melted and poured into a mold. Ethidium bromide is added to a concentration of 25 μL/L, and is mixed using a pipette tip. (Note: Ethidium bromide is a carcinogen, therefore use gloves when working with the gel. Remove the glove immediately after your work with ethidium bromide in order to avoid contamination of the lab). A comb is placed in the mold to create wells when the agarose solidifies.
When the gel is set, the comb is removed and the gel is transferred to a vessel containing 1x TAE buffer. A suitable DNA ladder is added to the first well, and each sample is then added to an individual well.
When all samples have been loaded, the gel is run with a constant voltage usually "

Measuring data for BIT-China
When iGEMers from BIT-China asked us whether we could allow them to use our Cytation Multi-Mode readers to monitor the gcolumnth state and fluorescence emissions of their engineered yeast, we agreed without hesitation. BIT-China wanted to detect both OD and fluorescence intensity simultaneously for up to 30 hours to evaluate the function of their yeast. With our help, they needn’t get up and take samples early in the morning but can obtain a much larger amount of data, saving them trouble and improving the reliability.

SDU-Denmark,2010,Team:SDU-Denmark#K343007_-_-_TEXT.html," Moreover we also recorded the bacteria's behavior when exposed to a blue light gradient and varying intensities of light measured in milliampere ranging from 1mA to 20mA. All the measurements were carried out on the modified phototactic bacteria and the wildtype MG1655 worked as a control.
The resulting videos looked like these examples:
The bacteria that are not moving in the video are assumed to be sticking to the glass or coverslip.
From these videos we extracted data through Unisensor's in-house programmed software Unify and it's tracking extension. For each frame the bacteria were identified and their location compared to that of the frame before and thereby, tracking the bacteria over time. The resulting data which served as output for each frame was: Location of bacteria given as coordinates (X,Y), bacterial orientation in angle ranging from -180° to 180° and length of the path was tracked in pixels. An example of the unify software analysing the paths of the bacteria and at the same creating a video of the individual tracks is showed below:
Here is an example of a .txt file containing the results: Tracks of wildtype bacteria exposed to red light . If interested, please request the whole dataset from us, which will be sent out as a 450MB zip file.
From this file, a trackplot was generated, showing each bacteria's path over the recorded time:
Figure 6: Bacteria containing K343007 tracked over 7.5 seconds
We started out with extracting the mean velocity in µm/frame for the photosensor and wildtype bacteria when exposed to red and blue light, the mean was extracted from around 100 paths for each of the 4 different samples (only taken from the experiment where we shifted between red and blue light. Data from the light intensity and gradient experiment were not included). Based on the assumption that bacteria that tumble less would have a higher mean velocity than of those exhibiting a normal rate of tumbling, we would expect a difference in mean velocity of the bacteria expressing the photosensor when illuminated with either red or blue light.
Contrary to our expectations the plot of mean velocity per frame did not show a noticeable difference between the four samples. The photosensor containing bacteria had about the same velocity/frame in blue and red light and there was no clear difference when compared to the wildtype either. The reason for this could be that we were not effective enough at excluding non-informative paths from the data file (i.e. bacteria that are trapped in a circular motion or bacteria only exhibiting Brownian motion) and / or that the conditions for which the experiments were carried out,"
ATOMS-Turkiye,2015,Team:ATOMS-Turkiye#Project#Ulcer_-_-_TEXT.html," this setup is to show that; Toehold-GFP doesn’t give fluorecence alone but if it comes together with Trigger RNA, GFP fluorescences. GFP production is also IPTG-dependent.
For the purposes given above, we made liquid culture of two different bacteria together; bacteria including only pColA-Toehold-GFP plasmid and bacteria including pCola-Toehold-GFP and PSB1C3-Trigger RNA. We incubated these bacteria in liquid culture for 13 hours at 37C and added IPTG into their mediums at 13. hour. After adding IPTG, we incubated them for more 3 hours at 37C. At the end of three hours, we firstly measured GFP fluorescence of the grown cultures by using VarioScan device.  The results of measurements are given above. They were made twice.
When the results are analyzed, it is obvious that Toehold-Trigger RNA parts gave very high amounts of flourescence together while Toehold-GFP part gave flourescence in a very low amount. There is almost 15 times difference between these two fluoroscence amounts.  This proves that Toehold-Trigger system works successfully. Also it is shown that systems work IPTG-dependently.
The graphs of measurement results are given below. The difference between two systems can be observed clearly.
Figure : GFP flourescent measurrement in LB mediums.
We also observed the liquid cultures under the fluorescence microscope.
Figure 2: Flourescence microscope image of GFP producing E. coli.
For better results, we isolated protein and we fluorimetrically measured them. Firstly we centrifuged the liquid cultures which were incubated for 16 hours. We took pictures of tubes after centrifugation, they are shown belown.
Figure : Pellets can be seen after 16 hours of liquid culter precipitated.
We applied Standard protein isolation protocol after this centrifuge and managed to isolate protein from the occured pellets. We made GFP fluorescence measurement with VarioScan from those isolated proteins. The results of measurements are shown below.
The measurement results of isolated proteins indicate that Toehold-Trigger system works very efficiently. GFP fluorescence amount of Toehold-trigger RNA including bacteria is about 175 times more than only Toehold including bacteria’s. also the leak of this system is almost negligible. In the absence of Trigger RNA, Toehold’s GFP fluorescence is almost zero. This indicates that our system works very efficient and in a very specific way.

Rfal
The gene Rfal codes for the enzyme Waal ligase. In the majority of E.coli, Waal ligase joins the O-antigen to the membrane-bound lipid core molecule. Since the K-12 strain has an insertion mutation in the gene coding for O-antigen, Waal ligase is free to join colanic acid to the lipid core.
The tethering of colanic acid to the cell will faciliate the encapsulation of individual cells confering enhanced acid resistance.

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Software_-_-_TEXT.html,"ranging from 0 to 0.02-fold of standard M9 medium) to study the relationship between ammonium concentration and response time of glnAp2. Consistent with our expectation, the lower the ammonium concentration, the shorter the response time (Figure 6,7).
To test the interference of other nitrogenous substances in ammonium detection, we collected and analyzed water sample from local farming ponds. We found that NO3- is the main nitrogenous substance other than ammonium in pond water with a concentration of approximately 60uM. Therefore, we added potassium nitrate of different concentration into working medium with 0.02-fold of standard ammonium concentration and detected fluorescence intensity and OD600 of bacteria culture. Results showed that 100uM nitrate had slight influence on response of glnAp2 to ammonium concentration, suggesting that glnAp2 is suitable for ammonia detection in aquaculture water (Figure 8).
Selecting SsrA-like tags
Three SsrA-like tags (LAA, LVA and DAS) were added to the C-terminus of mRFP downstream the promoter glnAp2. By analyzing the dynamics of fluorescence intensity in working medium, we compared protein-degradation effects of these tags. We found that mRFP with LAA- and LVA-tag were unable to emit detectable fluorescence, indicating a high degradation rate, while mRFP with DAS-tag still produced red fluorescence, which in turn suggested the inefficiency of DAS-tag (Figure 9). In the meantime, the response time mRFP with DAS-tag reveals a remarkable difference, indicating a reliable resolution, while the LAA and LVA do not (Figure 10).
Demonstrating function of our sensor system
We constructed a sensor circuit where a reporter mRFP with a moderate-degradation DAS-tag was expressed from an NtrC-regulated promoter glnAp2, and tested its function in laboratory.
In laboratory, we used Cytation3 Multi-Mode reader to obtain the kinetic curves. Obviously, the degradation tag leads to a remarkable drop in the maximum RFU, which makes the fluorescence signal harder to be detected by normal photoresistors (fig.9). This problem can be solved by employed other photoelectric sensors with higher sensitivity, or we can give up the idea of involving degradation tag, as the circuits without this tag has displayed reliable performances. Moreover, after being added a degradation tag, the system becomes more unstable, which is revealed from the decreased signal-noise ratio(fig 11,12). With help from"

11.Co-Immunoprecipitation Experiment (BNU-China Collaboration)
BNU-CHINA wanted to detect paclitaxel by using microtubule which expressed in E. coli. As we all know, microtubule which assembled by α-subunit and β-subunit is the Cytoskeleton in eukaryotes, but E. coli is prokaryote. So it is essential to verify whether microtubule assembled successfully or not in E. coli. If microtubule assembled successfully, that’s meaningα-subunit and β-subunit have biological activities and have interaction in E. coli. So, our team planned to use Co-Immunoprecipitation(Co-IP) to confirm their interaction. Because PET30a has the His protein tag, we planned to add HA protein tag and Flag protein tag behind α-subunit and β-subunit respectively. The target gene was amplified by PCR and cloned to T-vector and sequenced. Then link the confirmed gene to PET30a (enzyme site: XhoI and HindIII). Transform the recombination vector into expression strains BL21 when the concentration of bacterium is appropriate (OD600 is 0.6-0.8). Induce the strains by 1mmol IPTG. By using ultrasonic waves to break the cell of strain and centrifuging, we obtain the deposit. To conduct the Co-Immunoprecipitation(Co-IP), we dealed with the inclusion body to get the protein.

USTC_Software,2010,Team:USTC Software#dev_-_-_TEXT.html," for synthetic biology automatic modeling. It supports descriptions of a wide variety of different parts, including biobrick, compound, compartment, substituent, and so on. It can also describe the species constructed by these parts, and reactions happen with the species, such as binding of species, dilution of species, degradation of proteins, amplification of cells, multi-compartment reactions, and so on.
Many traditional methods fail to consider structure of species when trying to markup reactions with only reactants, modifiers, products and kinetic laws. The best part of MoDeL is that it can preserve detailed structure in species and reactions using Chain-Node Model. Based on the model, MoDeL is able to markup almost all kinds of reactions in a detailed and clear way.
Overview of MoDeL
Figure 5 above is an example of a simple network of biochemical reactions(pTetR + TetR2 = pTetR*:TetR2) that can be automatically constructed using MoDeL:
MoDeL supports automatic construction of such network with only the input of its initial conditions and environmental parameters. In order to do this, obviously the data of parts, species, reactions, compartment, units and so on is needed. Besides, relationships between these components are also needed, so we can link to a reaction when we find a species. Data of relationship is stored as references and exists in most MoDeL components.
To define all the needed components in a systematic way, MoDeL organizes them in five component containers at the top level:
:: System: This container contains definitions of units, functions, rules and global parameters. These are all basic elements for other components of MoDeL, and many are mathematical concepts without direct synthetic biology meanings. The name of the container, System, separates this container from others which contains components of biological significance, and indicates this container includes the basic parameters of the whole system.
:: Compartment: This container contains definitions of compartments. Compartment here is considered as a holder of substance with certain volume, so it only stores related data such as units and volume. It also stores a list of compartments that are permitted to be placed inside. For compartments like E.coli that can multiply, a corresponding compartment with the same id will be created in the sub-container of compartment in Part.
:: Part: This container contains definitions of parts. Part includes the basic units that can be inserted in an abstract chain. The container of Part has five sub-containers which are: compartment, biobrick, compound, plasmidBackbone, and substituent. Biobrick contains biobricks"

Human Practices
Human Practices Overview
    Human Practices account for a heavy portion in our team’s work. Since our project involves with Hepatitis C, which is a disease often ignored by the masses, our human practices effort is a comprehensive and international outreach approach, focusing specifically on gaining effective feedbacks from all walks of life and creating a basic science literacy of hepatitis and synthetic facts to the general public. We also discussed the design of our project with experts from hospitals and the Red Cross to improve our test paper so that it could be used by the consumers in an ideal situation. They also were helpful with advice on possible fields to apply our test paper.
Promotion In Book City
    On September 25th, SFLS_iGEMers went to Shenzhen Book City to introduce synthetic biology to the citizens and to conduct an online survey. We managed to get a stall inside of the building. In order to demonstrate our project to the citizens, we set up a huge poster beside the stall and successfully attracted lots of people.
    Team members stood on both sides of the walkway, delivering brochures of which contents are about some basic information of hepatitis. We gave those who were willing to fill in our questionnaire small badges and bookmarks originally designed by ourselves. When we sent our little gifts to the kids, they smiled happily, which made us happy too. We went around the entire Book city to ask the citizens if they were willing to complete our questionnaire and passed out the brochures.
   'The brochure that we designed to introduce HCV was delivered to more than 200 people, though not much people were willing to fill in the questionnaire.
    We are lucky to be the ones who introduce important knowledge to the citizens. After our activity, although we all felt tired, we were showered with sense of achievement and fulfillment.
    The results are ellaborated in the later ""Questionnaire ahout HCV detection"" section.

Presentation of the Prodhex Company
Prodhex is a company founded by René Jambon in 2002 as a first aid specialist. It offers emergency kits, bandages and many                                  types of dressings. They supply mainly French firefighters but also the medical emergency services, the French Red Cross or pharmacists.
We were able to get an interview with the current director Mr. Jambon who was able to present the operation of his company to us and give us his opinion on our project.
Current operation
Medical products are subject to a great deal of control when produced and sterilized.                                 That's why the Prodhex Company takes special care in the production of its dressings,                                 bandages and emergency products. The roll of fabric that will be in contact with the wound                                 may be spun, non-woven, plastic or adhesive. Fabric rolls (60 to 80 m) are placed in an                                 oven, then the glue is added onto the fabric. The rolls are then rolled up with adhesive                                 and cut (5 to 10 cm depending on the dressings). Once cut, the dressing will be equipped                                 with a central or complete compress. In the case of strips of 1m * 6m, the compress is                                 continuous and cut every meter. Finally, sterilization is performed by using gamma rays.                                 The most sensitive part is the precise placement of fabric for cutting but also gamma                                 sterilization.
Our innovation
After discussing our Cerberus protein and its fixation on dressings, Mr. Jambon told us that                                 our product was part of the current industry. Our protein would cause less risk for the patient                                 but also for the environment. Indeed the current fixing techniques are chemical and can be                                 corrosive for example. The areas of healing and antibiotics are developing rapidly and need to                                 attach directly to the dressing in a less harmful way for example.
SURVEYS
For this integrated human practice effort, it was important for us to have feedback from both professionals and customers that will use our product. Here, the complexity was that Cerberus offers a multiplicity of applications. We therefore decided to focus on one application and chose the medical field as we thought it would be the most sensitive application. More specifically, we questioned our population sample on how antibiotic-functionalised dressings could be of help in their daily life. We also directed our survey towards both practicians and patients, since their point of view could be different.
Practician survey

Team:Oxford/P&amp;P intellectual property
From 2014.igem.org
Intellectual Property
Intellectual Property is an increasingly important and controversial aspect of scientific advance, and synthetic biology is perhaps the paradigmatic area illustrating the effects of growing legal influence. When thinking about how teams could turn their ideas from iGEM projects into viable real-world solutions, we realized that intellectual property is a crucial area to address.
Our team has produced a report exploring how teams can approach this task and how iGEM intellectual property policy can make the transition easier.
We begin with a brief overview of current intellectual property law (specifically relevant to the UK) before progressing to look at the challenges this poses for the iGEM competition. A number of different approaches which iGEM might choose to adopt towards intellectual property are discussed and the pros and cons of each are assessed. We then asked a range of interested groups, including iGEM students, professionals, and the public, for their views before concluding with recommendations for addressing intellectual property concerns in iGEM. We offer our conclusions in the form of advice to students, to the iGEM foundation, and briefly explore how a change in the law could have consequences for iGEM. This advice is purely based on our own views and our research which we hope will make interesting food for thought - it is not professional legal advice and should not be relied on as such!
Our policy research in relation to students, the iGEM foundation, and policy makers is summarized below, or download the full report to learn more about our work.
Team Policy
Dealing with intellectual property is not only necessary on the level of the competition - each team must also make decisions as to how they wish to deal with the intellectual property they will acquire during the course of their project. Deciding whether to file a patent application can be a tricky decision - below are just some of the factors you might want to take into consideration…
Oxford iGEM 2014
Attitudes Survey
We conducted a survey of attitudes within iGEM teams to intellectual property. The results, illustrated below, are analysed in detail in our report. Broadly, we found a noticeable lack of understanding of IP issues (confirming the findings of University of British Columbia iGEM team 2013 - check out their great work on IP which we used as a starting point for our own research at https://2012.igem.org/Team:British_Columbia/Human_Practices/IP_FAQ), and a great"

The Gaussian Plate (Fig.4) [2] was designed to test if our exogenous genes would influence their olfactory receptor neuron pair (preference and repulsion to some chemical odors).

The final result were not such a good Gaussian distribution like the Galton board because the C. elegans' choices were not absolutely normal. In order to adjust our results we built a model.( the worm locomotion model )
The Immobilization Chip
The immobilization Chip was deigned to immobilize the C. elegans in worm traps or parallel channels for worm imaging and ethological experiments. [3]

We could immobilize the worms in the worm traps (Fig.8) and watch the neuronal activity (Fig.9) successfully using fluorescence microscope (Nikon eclipse Ti).

In addition, we could stimulate the Odr10::CoChR::GEM-GECO::mCherry worms to be active from the low state (Fig.10). On the other hand, we could also get the excitation wavelength of CoChR. The result showed that the light from the projector without filter (OD8) and the lights with 395 and 440 wavelengths from the LED of fluorescence microscope (Nikon eclipse Ti) could influence the C. elegans the other lights cannot. The lights with 395 and 440 wavelengths are closed to the ultraviolet which would hurt the C. elegans, so we got that the lights from the projector without the filter could active the CoChR.

By building a mathematical model, we demonstrate the principles of the project and provide guidance                     for optimizing product design and its application.
Gray value-density model The relationship between the gray value and the added                     substance concentration
We have established a grayscale model to describe our results in antigen fixation, antibody                         immobilization and detection, and to digitize the results into accurate numbers. This model can                         guide us to more accurately determine the relationship between the reaction results and our                         effects in three phases. Especially in the detection, the concentration of the analyte can be                         embodied and digitized, thus giving us a better and specific detection limit.
For the gray value calculation of a resulting image, we first grayscale it. In order to calculate                         the gray value of the color picture, we have grayed out with MATLAB. At the same time, in order                         to give a clear grayscale picture, we performed image equalization and gave a balanced                         picture[Attachment 1]. After obtaining the grayscale image, we use the formula (1) to                         calculate the grayscale of the image. In order to obtain accurate data more conveniently, we use                         the programming language to design a small software [Attachment 2], which can                         calculate the average grayscale of the image. There is an error in the data for the no grayscale                         picture. According to our experimental results, it is about 5% when the gray value is not too                         low. Compared with the equalized grayscale image, the error is about 10%.
$$ g_w = \sum_{i=0}^{255} i \times T_i \div T \tag{1} $$
For the experimental results, we can understand whether it is fixed antigen, immobilized antibody                         or detection. In the initial stage, the gray value is positively correlated with the                         concentration of the additive; and as the concentration of the additive increases, the gray                         value is not proportional to the increase. There are two models that satisfy these properties,                         namely equation (2) and formula (3):
Michaelis-Menten model: $$ y = \frac{\alpha x}{\beta + x} \tag{2} $$
Exponential growth model: $$ y = \alpha (1- exp(-\beta x)) \tag{3} $$
We substituting the above two formulas into the literature we examined[2], where model                         (2) is in                         good agreement. At the same time model (2) if the enzyme is compared to our slide, the substrate                         is analogous to our"

The experimental team had some frustrations this week (it wouldn’t be real science without them!). After waiting a long time for our primers to arrive, they had some very confusing contamination after our PCR. The next challenge is to work out where it came from! The economics team drew up a list of things that need doing by time the project ends, and there’s lots of work to do! This week they found out that ‘sustainable’ palm oil isn’t as sustainable as you’d think. You can read much more about this on our ethics pages

Genetic probability model
This model describes the process in which we get 2 worm strains with stable genetic traits and the hybrid offspring (with both the preference of blue light and the repulsion to the red light). It was proposed at the beginning of our project, so we were able to decide the frequency of microinjection and estimate how long it would take to get the result. It is a time-consuming step, and to some extent, it determines the whole experiment process.
Fig 2.1  Overview of microinjection Inject plamids in worms gonad by miniMos system.
Fig 2.2  Illustration of screening process for the miniMos System
There are 3 steps to achieve it: Inject plasmid (odr-10::CoCHR::GEM-GECO::mCherry and str-1::Chrimson::GEM-GECO::GFP) through miniMOS system .
Select the rescued worms using mCherry and GFP.
Mate the 2 strains to get the hybrid offspring of red fluorescence on AWA neuron and green fluorescence on AWB neuron.
Plasmid injection and selection
To estimate the total number of worms X that we need to inject, many factors should be considered. It is said in the protocol of miniMos system, “we approximately get insertions from 60% of injected animals and from approximately 10% of all rescued F1 animals. But these numbers will depend greatly on how much practice you have in injecting. ” [1]
Fig 2.3 The MiniMos System
After a long period of practice, our successful rate of injection is around 12%~25%. In calculation, we assume that the rate is 20%. After injecting the gene into its gonad, each worm produces approximately 10 embryos. About 10% of F1 containing the insertion gene can be rescued (The"

We have been in contact with Calgary regarding kill switches. More details to follow later.
One of our potential knockouts and a positive control were grown on the M9 plates. There was growth on both plates, although the growth on the positive control was much faster and greater than the potential knockout. Since the potential knockout was able to grow on the amino acid-less M9 media, it appears to be not auxotrophic. Characterization with PCR continues to be difficult, and it was suggested that we simply sequence the strains.
The plates with the potential knockouts were placed in the 37° incubator overnight to cure the plasmid.
The potential biobricks were successfully miniprepped, and a PCR was performed to isolate what was actually between the VF2 and the VR primers in the plasmid. The product will then be run on a gel, and if it appears the correct length, will be sent for sequencing.
Our Pseudomonas competent cells appear to work (conferring antibiotic resistance), but they are not expressing rfp.
We made spec plates, but a lawn grew with our transformed cells. Interestingly, on top of this lawn grew several well defined colonies. We attempted to grow these colonies (and the proper negative controls) in varying amounts of spectinomycin. It is possible the plates had insufficient spec, or that the strain we are working with is naturally resistant (there was a lawn, but no large colonies, on the negative control).
Several more biobricks from the registry were transformed.
Joe made M9 plates with an amino acid, to further test his knockout.

The PCR to isolate and amplify the insert from the potential biobrick showed many bands, characteristic of non-specific primer binding. As another test to see if the insert was correct, we cut with EcoRI and PstI to look for the appropriate insert size, and indeed found that there was an insert at about the right size. With this in mind, simply sequencing from the plasmid is the next step. However, our sequencing company only accepts orders until 1:30 PM, and it was 4:30 before everything that needed to be done was done.
The transformations from yesterday's transformations appeared to work. Also, interestingly, the colony from on top of the spec plate lawn, but not the spec plate lawn itself, was able to grow in 40 and 80 ug/mL spec.

UMaryland,2017,Team:UMaryland_-_-_TEXT.html," initially predicted that eventually the overexpression of the TLP will kill the cell causing TLP release to the exterior surroundings. This TLP would be available to interact with and attack the fungi. However, we were advised that this method was not reliable due to the possibility of protein aggregation and so we decided to secrete the protein instead. We found several iGEM teams had worked with protein secretion in E. coli, including Unicamp - EMSE Brazil 2011 and used the information they provided as well as their results to create a secretion part. We found that gram negative bacteria, like E. coli, have a secretion system that involves HlyB, HlyD, and TolC proteins. HlyB is an ATP-binding cassette transporter. HlyD is a membrane fusion protein, and TolC is an outer membrane protein. HlyB and HlyD are not present in all strains, so there was a necessity to express them in our bacteria and incorporate the two proteins into our part. In order for a protein of interest to be secreted through this system, it must be labeled with an HlyA signal sequence, which we decided to add to the C terminus of our TLP.
We integrated all the different parts and components to one design.
Overview of circuit design. The phlF repressor and TLP genes are always constitutively expressed.  A. Without Fusaric Acid: Without fusaric acid the repressor remains “off.” An antisense RNA that compliments the TLP gene is expressed under the pPhlf promoter. TLP translation is inhibited by the binding of TLP RNA to the antisense RNA. B. With Fusaric Acid: The phlF repressor activated by fusaric acid. Once activated, phlF is able to bind to the operator on the Pphlf promoter, thus inhibiting the expression of the antisense RNA. Without the antisense RNA inhibiting translation, TLP is produced. C. Protein Secretion: The TLP is labeled with an HlyA signal sequence that will allow it to be secreted out of the cell via an HlyB-HlyD-TolC transport complex.
Plasmid Design. Our final plasmid for an E. coli chassis includes a “sensing” system controlled by the phlF repressor and the PphlF promoter it acts on, a “silencing” mechanism with antisense TLP expressed in normal conditions, a “killing” system that produces antifungal TLP, and an export system that utilizes the Hly"

An important aspect of the iGEM competition is the use and creation of standard  biological parts. Each team will make new parts during iGEM and will place them in the Registry of Standard Biological Parts . The iGEM software provides an easy way to present the parts your team has created . The ""groupparts"" tag will generate a table with all of the parts that your team adds to your team sandbox.  Note that if you want to document a part you need to document it on the Registry , not on your team wiki.
Remember that the goal of proper part documentation is to describe and define a part such that it can be used without a need to refer to the primary literature. The next iGEM team should be able to read your documentation and be able to use the part successfully. Also, you should provide proper references to acknowledge previous authors and to provide for  users who wish to know more.

Cambridge-JIC,2016,Team:Cambridge-JIC#Model_-_-_TEXT.html,"oplasmy time observed from about a 50-50 chance of template choice onwards.
We next checked the effect of increasing the number of “driver” and “gene of interest” cassettes. The number of “gene of interest” cassettes inserted into the chloroplast had no effect at all on the timescales to homoplasmy, as the information on this cassette is rapidly duplicated during the transformation. However, increasing the number of “driver” cassettes greatly decreased the timescale to homoplasmy, with an order of magnitude increase (from 1 to 10) more than halving the timescale.
Graph 8
Finally, we varied our values for kpsaA, katpA, δpsaA/δatpA, δCas9, kCas9, and kh. Varying kpsaA and kh had negligible effect on homoplasmy timescales and is not graphed here. The results show the model to be highly sensitive to varying Cas9’s transcription and translation rates in either direction, and to increasing RNA degradation rates, yet reasonably insensitive to all other parameter changes. Encouragingly, the maximum plausible timescale for homoplasmy which results from parameter variation across two orders of magnitude is 1345 minutes (22.45 hours), still within a single day.

Heifei University of Technology iGEM
Testing of Heifei iGEM’s Software
Our collaboration with Heifei University began in early summer, when they reached out to several iGEM teams asking what software iGEM teams were using in their projects. The Heifei iGEM Team is made of software specialists, who are not very familiar with how synthetic biologist’s research and design genetic constructs. The software they are designing is aimed at helping synthetic biologists. With our team members having biology backgrounds and experience in designing genetic constructs, we decided to test Heifei iGEM’s software and give them our feedback. This helped Heifei to assess how user friendly their software was, and what its usefulness is for synthetic biologists.
We tested their software in October by using it to look up information on parts we were using in our project. The information on genetic parts, and the recommendations the software provided helped us to come up with a design for a kill switch. The ability of their software to narrow down and refine searches was immensely helpful in deciding on a genetic part to use; when there are hundreds to choose from, often scattered in different databases, a tool that can narrow the options down would save time and effort.
We found Heifei iGEM’s software to be very useful, it was significantly easier to have all the genetic parts in one single place; one where we could look at information about one specific part, see relationships between 2 different parts, and receive recommendations for other parts we could use. Using the software to design genetic constructs and research genetic parts would save time and effort. It is faster and easier than having to sift through several different databases to find genetic parts. Furthermore, the software provided not just a DNA sequence, but recommended similar parts, provided a description of the part, and showed us papers with more information on the genetic part.

Amsterdam,2017,Team:Amsterdam#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," reduce methane emissions by cattle. We explore the possibilities of ways to deliver fumarate in the cow digestive system and the hurdles to overcome with these strategies. As iGEM UNL is working on E. Coli and iGEM Amsterdam on the production of  fumarate, we first define a strategy to make a fumarate producing E. Coli mutant. Then we assess the mechanism to reduce methane emissions with fumarate. Finally, we explore different ways to deliver fumarate in the cow digestive system.
How E. Coli can produce fumarate
E. Coli can in theory produce fumarate by an oxidative (aerobic) or a reductive (anaerobic) route. In the latter case, the fumarate molecule itself is used as a final electron donor in this process, which is believed to be coupled with cell growth in anaerobic conditions (Iverson et al. , 1999). It is assumed that for this reason, it is not possible to genetically engineer E. Coli to produce fumarate in anaerobic conditions (Song et al. , 2013). This is problematic,as the cattle rumen is anaerobic.
Now if it would be possible to introduce E. Coli in aerobic conditions in the cow’s digestive system, we would be able to use aerobically producing fumarate E. coli strains. For this, we could imitate a genetic engineering strategy used by the iGEM Amsterdam project.
How team Amsterdam produces fumarate in Cyanobacteria
In the Cyanobacterial model organism Synechocystis PCC 6803 , iGEM team Amsterdam managed to produce fumarate in a genetically stable, growth-coupled way, by knocking out the fumarase encoding fumaric acid hydratase (fumC) gene.
How we can apply the Amsterdam genetic engineering strategy in E. Coli
To apply a similar approach in E. Coli and to end up with a respectable titer, multiple gene knock-outs are required. E. Coli has more fumarase encoding genes, then Synechoscystis,  namely anaerobic class I fumaric acid hydratase (fumB) and aerobic class I fumaric acid hydratase (fumA), which both need to be knocked out as well (Song et al. , 2013). Knocking out the Fumarase proteins leads to a dysfunctional or a ‘broken’ TCA-cycle, since malate cannot be formed anymore from f"
Uppsala,2015,Team:Uppsala#Enzymes_-_-_TEXT.html,". The end product in the extradiol degradation pathway is an aldehyde which is much more harmful to the cell than a carboxylic acid (Bugg, 1 September 2003). Therefore an intradiol dioxygenase; catechol 1,2 dioxygenase, was chosen. This enzyme had been used by a previous iGEM team; Hong Kong 2013 but had not been characterized ( BBa_K1092003 ). This specific isoform of dioxygenase is suitable for extracellular export, since most known dioxygenases are dimers, stabilized by noncovalent interactions, and the current catechol 1,2 dioxygenase is a monomer. Inferring from the crystal structure of the enzyme, both its C and N termini do not participate in critical interactions within the enzyme, which makes them suitable sites for export tag fusion.
Figure 1: Crystal structure of catechol-1,2-dioxygenase.
Secretion system
We also incorporated an export-tag to our enzymes. This enables extracellular degradation of PAH and therefore protects the cells from the toxic PAHs and its metabolites. We are using the secretion tag HlyA ( BBa_K554002 ) from the α-hemolysin system, originated from Staphylococcus aureus. It’s a 60 amino acid long sequence attached to the C-terminal of our enzymes. This sequence is recognized by the Type 1 secretion system ( BBa_K1166002 ) .
System design
We designed our construct in order to have a regulated expression of PAH-degrading enzymes with an on and off switch. We chose a sensor that could react to salicylate when present; the production of our degrading enzymes would start in combination with a modified red fluorescent protein, dTomato, that indicates that there are PAHs present. We found one interesting repressor system known as the NahR-Psal-promoter which is a promoter that is induced by compounds similar to salicylic acid. Salicylic acid is a compound with a single aromatic ring and is a metabolite of naphthalene degradation. The enzymes to convert naphthalene to salicylic acid is incorporated in a separate construct plasmid (you can read about this part of the project here ). Because of the copresence of naphthalene and other PAHs in the environment, this is a suitable system design.
When induced the expression of the red fluorescent protein, dTomato, starts and the degradation part of the construct gets expressed. The"

Valencia,2009,Team:Valencia#A short story_-_-_TEXT.html," that the luminescent substance of the jellyfish can be extracted.
But my real surprise came in the next moment, when I added a small amount of seawater to the solution and saw that its light became explosively strong. The experiment showed that some component of seawater activates the luminescence. Because the composition of seawater is known, I quickly discovered that the activator is Ca2+. The discovery of Ca2+ as the activator in turn suggested that EDTA should serve as a better inhibitor of luminescence than acidification during the extraction of the lightemitting principle. On the basis of these data, we devised a method of extracting the light-emitting principle.
With a workable procedure in hand for extracting the luminescent principle, our next task was to catch and process as many jellyfish as possible. We would collect jellyfish from 6 to 8 AM, then after a quick breakfast, we would cut rings from the jellyfish until noon. We devoted all afternoon to the extraction. After dinner, we again collected jellyfish from 6:30 to 8:30 PM, and the catch was kept in an aquarium to be processed next day together with the catch of the next morning. We soon found that the bottleneck of the operation was the step of cutting rings with scissors, which is a delicate and very slow process. Even after considerable practice, it took more than 1 minute to cut one jellyfish ring, and 3 hours of work by four persons could not produce more than 500 rings. To increase productivity, we hired several high school girls, trained them, and paid them 2 cents for each ring they cut. We also decided to buy jellyfish from the kids of scientists living on the campus, paying a penny for each jellyfish. This job provided dual benefits, the fun of catching jellyfish and of earning money. I remember a 6- or 7- year-old girl who grossed more than 10 dollars in 2 days (probably with parental help). Unfortunately, just when our operation was in full swing, the jellyfish suddenly vanished from the area. Thus, we extracted and processed only about 10,000 specimens of Aequorea that summer.
We returned to Princeton with the jellyfish extract packed in dry ice, and then began to purify the lightemitting principle from the extract by repeated chromatography on various kinds of large columns. It was a long process, and the utmost care was required to prevent the luminescence activity from being lost, which could be brought about by many causes. We completed the purification in early "

Calgary_Entrepreneurial,2013,Team:Calgary Entrepreneurial#Project#Risk_-_-_TEXT.html," a genetically modified organism. Although we have taken every step possible to ensure that our final product will be safe to use and will not pose any environmental concerns, there is always the possibility that a negative public perception of genetically modified organisms will result in lower adoption of our technology. As such, we have begun to explore additional designs for our product that would make use of an in-vitro system, allowing us to remove the bacterial component of our final product all together.
Technological and Operational Risks
Another very serious category of risks for FREDsense technologies is technological risks. Although alternative target markets could be entered should unforeseen regulatory or market hurdles be encountered, serious shortcomings in the technology could pose significant risk to the company’s viability. There are key research and development milestones, as described previously, that need to be completed in order to reach a prototype stage. Should some of these key steps prove difficult or unfeasible, we will need to re-evaluate our technology. In order to mitigate this risk, we have developed a comprehensive technological implementation plan that focuses on completing high-risk activities first. This will enable us to make any major changes in the design of our product early on, allowing us to avoid significant increases in time and costs which would occur if changes were made later on.  In addition, we are exploring alternative methods of designing our sensor should one of these challenges prove to be insurmountable. As well, it is important to consider changes in the cost of the components of the technology. We have designed our cartridge system to be as economically viable as possible as discussed in the operations section . Should the cost of any one component drastically increase however, we may need to re-design our system. This would likely involve changing electroactive substrates in order to reduce cost. Although this would slightly increase the time needed for research and development, if it would enable us to meet our financial goals, it may be necessary.
Financial Risks
As a technology-based company, financial hurdles are likely to be significant for us, particularly for early research and development activities as well as for production. As such, there is always risk that we will not be able to secure the required funding for each stage. In order to mitigate these risks, we have developed a comprehensive budget for the next three years and a cash flow analysis for the next 5 years. This budget will be updated as cost projections change and will allow us to carefully plan our spending. In addition, should we find ourselves in a position where we require extra finances that we cannot acquire, we will suspend all research and development activities not focused on reaching the market for our first generation product.

Argon Design System - Free Design System for Bootstrap 4
Project Description
Overview & Introduction
Microfluidics is the scientific field which studies the manipulation of small amounts of fluids on the scale of microliters and nanoliters. Engineered systems have been created to move and manipulate these fluids within microfluidic devices. The application of microfluidics in synthetic biology research will enable scientists to design and implement synthetic biology systems more efficiently and with greater reproducibility. Currently, these devices have been incorporated in fields such as genetic analysis, DNA amplification, cell-based assays and analysis, point-of-care diagnostics, drug discovery, and more.
Problem Statement
While microfluidics is not new to the field of synthetic biology, it is not currently widely used or accessible to many benchtop biologists. The current “lab on a chip” microfluidic devices are highly specialized to each experiment and expensive to manufacture. In order to analyze the results of the experiments on microfluidic chips, many designs embed sensors directly into the chip. Many of these sensors, however, already exist in traditional analytical devices, such as plate readers. These devices could be used for analysis of microfluidic outputs if the outputs were dispensed selectively into a compatible vessel, such as a microtiter plate. If this were possible, synthetic biologists would be able to incorporate microfluidic chips to streamline their experiments without sinking time and money to design and fabricate highly specialized chips. Therefore an application agnostic system that selectively dispenses outputs into vessels currently use in traditional benchtop biology would result in a more efficient method for performing analysis.
Our Project
Our project, Terra, aims to create an automated system that bridges benchtop biology and microfluidics. Terra is comprised of three main components:
Microfluidics: A microfluidic chip designed to execute a desired biological experiment.
Hardware: A low-cost, accessible XY-translational stage that selectively dispenses the output of the microfluidic chip to a 96-well plate and automated control syringes.
Software: A software interface that will allow the user to detail the parameters of the experiment run on the chip; the specific location per output on the 96-well plate; and the amount of each output dispensed.

Calgary,2012,Team:Calgary#Sandbox_-_-_TEXT.html," real weakness is a paralyzing fear I have of public transit vehicles (ZOMG BUSSSSS!!1!!1) when I am in a car. Free time? I don't have any ****ing free time, since I'm always at iGEM or putting out fires started by intoxicated first years at residence. These activities, however, do lead me to often drink copious amounts of ethanol, become apoplectic, and occasionally slam my head into the table for no apparent reason. I should also mention that I am a very sensical person even though I like the big bang theory and that show about sporks.
Roberta Menezes
I have just graduated from University of Southampton, UK, with a BSc (Hons) in Biomedical Sciences. I love spending my summers volunteering in different labs around the world. I have done this previously at the University of Zaragoza, Spain, helping research on atherosclerosis, and at the Evandro Chagas Institute, a centre for tropical disease, in Brazil. It is my first time taking part in iGEM and it has been an amazing experience being involved in the wet lab part of the project. Not only have I experienced the world of synthetic biology, but I have also made many great friends. Some of my hobbies outside of the lab include, painting, dancing, and eating good food!
Zhibek Salimbayeva
Initially from Kazakhstan, Zhibek grew up in the cold heights of the Tian Shan Mountains amongst the country’s symbolic snow leopards. In 2004 she moved to Canada in hopes to start an eagle hunting business with her brother Borat in the prairie provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan. However, due to the strict regulations and small market the business soon went downhill. She is now in her 3rd year of biological sciences at the University of Calgary, and is hoping to pursue the field of Medicine. Her favorite cuisine includes Kazakh traditional horsemeat sausages (kazy), roasted sheep head, and salty cheese balls (qurut). In her spare time she practices archery, camel riding and playing music on a dombra.

Stanford,2018,Team:Stanford#HP#Gold Integrated_-_-_TEXT.html," obtain greenhouse space to try our hydroponic system and learned about some of the variables, such as light exposure and nutrients, that would make the biggest differences in our cultivation.
Growers
Overview
Growers are at the backbone of OxyPonics since our goal is to have them incorporate our platform in their greenhouses. So we interviewed a lot of them - over 30 total. We talked, and we listened to what they had to tell us, instead of trying to steer the conversations to oxidative stress specifically. The feedback helped us authentically realize what farmers are looking for to improve their farms.  This helped us understand what the problems we should be addressing are - a critical step to the design thinking process. Some of the most valuable exchanges are detailed in this section.
Key Takeaways
Many farmers are working towards consistent crop yields and larger, tastier plants by moving towards automation. Our OxyPonics system was developed to help growers like the ones we talked to survey their crops more efficiently.
Most farmers are looking to increase margins since hydroponic farming is typically much more expensive than traditional farming, and has many costly requirements for operation and upkeep. As a result, many hydroponic farms have failed within a few years of starting.
Hydroponic farmers currently work with the variables of light, atmospheric pressure, humidity, pest control, microbes, temperature, pH, and nutrient levels. Hydroponics requires a controlled environment.
Oxidative stress is a variable largely untapped by current growers. Considering the background gained from literature and researchers, we believe monitoring and maintaining certain levels of oxidative stress could increase plant growth. There is a need for a product like OxyPonics.

Omega Gardens
Omega Gardens is a small hydroponics set-up focused on turning consumers into producers. Ted Marchildon, the owner, has a rotary greenhouse, which captures and spreads artificially added light to allow plant growth using only 3-4 watts. We hoped to gain insight on what makes his small scale farm work in an economic sector based on produce numbers.  Omega Gardens is fleshing out an idea called Farmdominiums, which would be much like modern-day sharecropping where you buy land and pay people to grow the crops for you.  They are working to increase the atmospheric pressure in their greenhouses to increase crop growth. We learned that Omega Gardens deals with bugs and humidity problems. They aim to better conserve water and make a realistic environment for plants. From them, we learned that, as we expected, farmers care a lot about the"

Helping ZJU-China construct their biobrick
We helped ZJU-China construct a calcium responsive promotor which plays a significant role in their crops-protecting project. This promotor can sense the increase of calcium ion concentration cause by a medium wave signal and express downstream genes to achieve the goal of using wave signal to regulate chassis gene expression. We used Golden Gate Assembly to assemble seven different fragments of the promotor in E. coli, and used Gibson Assembly to shift the promotor onto shuttle vector for their further use. We cultivated sincere friendship with ZJU-China through our close collaboration, they also attended our Beijing-Tianjin iGEM Meetup in Beijing in spite of the 1500km distance between us.

World-wide data base of water pollution
Invited by Tianjin, we collaborated with FAFU-CHINA, XMU-China, SCUT-China A and other 5 teams to construct a world-wide data base of water pollution, especially copper pollution and cadmium pollution. After collecting all the data we need, we drew a map to visualize the data we collected. By constructing this map, we can get better understanding of the overall condition of water pollution around the world. As ammonia pollution is one of the severe water pollutions, we believed by collaborating with these wonderful teams, we can have better understanding of our own project from a brand new point of view.

From the above conditions,GFP0/RFP0=1
Considering the dual fluorescence system in the expression will have a very complex side effects, affected by many factors, beyond our current level, so we decided to assuming that the linear relationship for first, then combined with our search of the literature data, using professional literature data prove that the dual fluorescence system linear relationship.
From the experimental data and the conclusion shown in the literature, it could be seen clearly that there is an obvious mathematical linear relationship between the two fluorescence systems.
It could be proved by the literature data that the dual fluorescence detection system was feasible and had a great amplification effect. During the next experiment, we could construct a feasible dual fluorescence detection system based on the literature.
Conclusion
According to the modeling of two parts, we could guarantee that the feasibility verification of gene line and the theory of dual fluorescence system, and then determine the relationship between output and input by simulating the expression of dual fluorescent system. Based on the modeling of two parts, we can also get this conclusion: The input signal was further linear amplified by the ratio of red and green fluorescent signal. So we succeeded in modeling, providing theoretical basis for the expression group, providing theoretical support for the purpose of our team's final testing, providing the necessary guidance for the success of their subsequent experiments.

DTU-Denmark,2015,Team:DTU-Denmark#Project#Intein_-_-_TEXT.html," under control of promoter BBa_J23101  were selected and re-streaked in order to grow enough biomass for detection of peptides by chromatography. Due to time constraints, the sequence of the transformants were not confirmed. Instead, six samples for each peptide (total of 12) were analyzed by UHPLC-DAD-QTOFMS. It was not possible to detect the cyclized protein from methanol extraction of secondary metabolites. In order to confirm whether this was due to improper splicing of intein, cell lysates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The size of the unspliced protein iwas 19.4 kDA (cycloviolacin Y1) and 17.2 kDa (tyrocidine-like). It was not possible to detect bands at this molecular weight on the gel (data not shown). The size of the cyclic peptide was below the lower detection limit for SDS-PAGE.
Discussion
It was not possible to produce short cyclic peptides using the Npu DnaE. No unspliced variant were detected by SDS-PAGE and no cyclized peptides were detected by LC/MS. This may be explained by (1) a sequence mistake in the construct or incorrect integration of the promoter and/or (2) that the peptide was not proper cyclized. As 12 colonies were sequenced, it seems unlikely that a mutation in the oligo should be present in all transformants. The promoter may not have been inserted correctly, but the results are contradicting. Lack of cyclisation may be due to either its small size (tyrocidine) or the fact that the extein sequence was mutated from its native for expression of cycloviolacin Y1. It may also not be possible to distinguish the unspliced intein-peptide due to background in E. coli. Cyclisation of cylotides (cycloviolacin Y1 is a cyclotide) by Npu DnaE has been achieved in E. coli. [4]. It has however to our knowledge not been possible to use Npu DnaE to successfully cyclize a 10 amino acid peptide. It may be possible to achieve cyclisation of these peptides by exploring the diversity of inteins used by different organisms [5].

Amplify the rest of the eluate by adding the eluate to the 20-ml ER2738 culture from Step 4 (should be early-log at this point, i.e. OD600 ~ 0.01-0.05) and incubating with vigorous shaking for 4.5 hours at 37°C.
Note: The remaining eluate can be stored overnight at 4°C at this point, if preferred, and amplified the next day. In this case, inoculate 10 ml of LB+Tet with ER2738 and incubate with shaking overnight at 37°C. The next day, dilute the overnight culture 1:100 in 20 ml of LB in a 250-ml Erlenmeyer flask (do not use a 50 ml conical tube) and add the unamplified eluate. Incubate with vigorous shaking for 4.5 hours at 37°C and proceed to Step 10.
Transfer the culture to a centrifuge tube and spin for 10 minutes at 12,000 g at 4°C. Transfer the supernatant to a fresh tube and re-spin (discard the pellet).
Transfer the upper 80% of the supernatant to a fresh tube and add to it 1/6 volume of 20% PEG/2.5 M NaCl. Allow the phage to precipitate at 4°C for at least 2 hours, preferably overnight.

Columbia_NYC,2015,Team:Columbia NYC#Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," applications of synthetic biology. Thus, it is important in the future to consider what synthetic biologists should do to garner more support for their cause and to assess what the public fears and support about GMO.
When asked about probiotics, the results show that 27.4% of the population do not know what it is. To help inform our survey takers, we explain that probiotics are live bacteria that are shown to be good for one's digestive health by supporting the beneficial bacteria in the gut and can be found in food such as yogurt, kefir, and miso. Given this information, 85.7% felt as if they have a better understanding of what probiotics are. When asked how comfortable they were with consuming probiotic from a scale from 1-5, 71.4% reported a comfort level greater than or equal to 4 as shown on the right. This seems to signify that people are more inclined towards consuming probiotics because of the benefits it can give and its more natural nature.
In order to get a better understanding of what people were concerned about, we had them choose topics they would want to learn more about (see graph below). It is clear that people are most concerned about the potential impact GMOs have on the environment, how GMOs would affect the body, who is benefiting monetarily from GMO developments, and how they would be regulated. Thus, the survey has allowed us to learn what the public wants to learn about GMOs and probiotics and although we have not been able to follow up on this survey, we have a better understanding of how to approach and educate the public about these issues in the future and this is an extremely important first step.
;
Further Engaging the Public
In addition to the online survey, team members also went out to talk with people directly to facilitate conversation about synthetic biology between the general public and those involved in the field of science. One such opportunity for this involved volunteering at the New York Hall of Science ""Building with Biology"" pilot exhibit. This gave members of our team the chance to talk to children and their parents about synthetic biology. One of our biggest take-aways was that children were much more open to the idea of using engineered bacteria in their day-to-day lives while their parents were much more reluctant to support such developments. This leads us to believe that the next generation will be more inclined to support advancements in the way we think about bacteria. However, in order for this to happen, children need to be more exposed to and educated on the possibilities of synthetic biology.
Furthermore, interactions with the public have shown that as they learn more about"

(1)The first regulator was T7 polymerase and T7 promoter.
T7 polymerase was put in the “Controlled DNA Invertase device”. In G+ cells, T7 polymerase was in the right orientation and expressed by Ptet. Threefore, Pt7 could express real-time reporters. When T7 polymerase sequence was inverted in P+ cells, further expression of real-time would cease.
 
(2)The second regulator was riboregulator.

Functionality:
In our design, BBa_K145215 (“TetR promoter + J23066 RiboKey”) was put in G- on the plasmid incompatible with F factor.
 
 
The Ribolock “TetR promoter + lock3d” was constructed and put in G+ on the F plasmid.
 
We improved an existing biobrick part BBa_I714070([pTet][Lock3]). We could not  transforme this part from the distribution kit, and the QC results for this part in the registry were bad, too. Bad sequence, inconsistent resistence, and bad gel results.
Therefore, we constructed this part by ourselves. We assembled two basic parts Ptet BBa_R0040 and [lock3d] BBa_J23032 to create a new part: BBa_K1087004
Sequence results were confired the successful construclion, and we did lots of tests to prove its function.
 
We assembled BBa_K1087004 with mRFP to create BBa_K1087015 , and we ligate BBa_K1087015 with RiboKey BBa_K145215 to create the new BBa_K1087021 .

We transformed BBa_K1087015 , BBa_K1087021 into E.coli DH5α, respectively. And we used Ptet + mRFP1 (BBa_I13521) as positive control, irrelevant BBa_J61046 as negative control. The transformed cells were cultured separately in the same condition and measured the intensity of fluorescence at the same time. See results.

Different truncations (67, 100, 150, 180, 249, 300 bp) were planned for deciding the minimal promoter region, but in the course of construction, only the 100bp version could be finished in time. It was tested to be functional and therefore submitted as PcelA.
PcelA and PcomFA gene were both cloned from the genomic DNA of S. pneumoniae strain NCTC7465 by PCR using Vent Polymerase. The difference between these two promoters is the whole sequence of PcomFA was obtained from Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, a British genomics and genetics research institute.

Assembly
comX and comW construct contain 3 parts that need to be assembled: BBa_K880005 which contains constitutive promoter and RBS, comX engineered with C-myc tag / comW engineered with FLAG tag, and a double terminator in pSB1C3 backbone. Promoter, RBS, comX engineered with C-myc tag, and double terminator were combined using traditional digestion and ligation method. The ligation product was confirmed by digestion check and sequencing.
Com-Box construct also contains 3 parts that need to be assembled: PcelA/PcomFA promoter, BBa_E0240 which contains RBS, GFP and double terminator, and pSB1C3 backbone. All three parts were combined using traditional digestion and ligation method. The final ligation product was confirmed by digestion check and sequencing.
Characterization
RPU (Relative promoter unit) and leakage will be measured as a characterization of 100 base pairs Com-Box promoter (PcelA), and 160 base pairs Com-Box promoter (PcomFA). For Com-Box promoter characterization, σx generator construct which contains BBa_K880005 , comX gene, and BBa_B0015 , is ligated with P"

Ligation and Transformation of pSB1C3-T7-Lys: First Attempt [✔️]
In this attempt we had changed several of the experimental procedures and also used a chloramphenicol backbone. Here, we finally succeeded with the 3A Assembly and two colonies were observed from the the transformed E. coli TOP10 culture. The colonies were picked and confirmed with colony PCR using VF2 and primers VR. The expected size of the amplicon is 1093 bp and can clearly be identified on the gel below (well 6 and 7).
Figure 4. Colony PCR of E. coli TOP10 containing pSB1C3-T7-Lys. (1) Ladder (6) Lys Colony 1 (7) Lys Colony 2.
Demonstrating expression and investigating solubility of Lys in E. coli
The pSB1C3-T7-Lys was first transformed into the expression strain E. coli BL21(DE3). To express lysostaphin, IPTG was used as an inducer. The induced cells were then sonicated and separated into pellets and supernatant which serves to identify the solubility of lysostaphin. It is considered soluble if it is found in the supernatant or insoluble if it is bound to cellular compartments and found in the pellet. Hence, the separated samples are then analysed with a SDS-PAGE analysis.
Protein expression using IPTG Induction [✔️]
IPTG concentrations were varied between 0.5 mM and 1.0 mM. This variation was employed to see if high concentrations of IPTG or a high expression of the protein could have a negative impact towards the E. coli BL21(DE3) cells. Lysostaphin is a bacteriolytic enzyme and thus could potentially disrupt the cell walls of the expression system.
SDS-PAGE of Expressed Lys [✔️]
Based on the open reading frame from the T7-Lys construct (741 bp) a fully expressed protein would be around 27 kDa in size. The SDS PAGE result is shown in Figure 5. On the protein ladder, 30 kDa corresponds to the fifth band from the top. The result of the SDS Page show bands of approximately 30 kDa on all the transformed samples including that from the supernatant and pellet. Whereas the untransformed samples do not display protein bands of this size (lane 2 and "
