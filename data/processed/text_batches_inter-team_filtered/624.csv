Newcastle,2009,Team:Newcastle#Labwork#27 August 2009_-_-_TEXT.html," saw pGFP-rrnB DNA being cut with restriction enzymes EcoRI and NheI which is now stored in the -20C freezer. For today's lab session, we hope to run the enzyme digested pGFP-rrnB products on agarose gel (also made yesterday) and use this analytical procedure to isolate the 7995Kb plasmid fragment. Once the fragment has been determined by exposure to ultra-violet light, we hope to cut it out of the gel and extract the DNA from the agarose using a gel extraction kit.
Extracting the 8Kb fragment
Prof. Wipat updating lab-book before carrying out the gel extraction process
40ul of the DNA + restriction enzyme solution was run on the gel for about 10-20 minutes under 70mv before the electrophoresis was stopped. The gel was then taken to the dark room (where the gel analysis equipment is kept) and under UV light, the fluorescing band found at the top of the well was cut out of the gel. The fragment was then placed in an Eppendorf tube for the gel extraction process. Although the heavier band was taken for processing, it has to be said that we were unconvinced that the digestions had worked properly; the bands we had expected to see did not emerge and the probable reason for this the time these enzymes had to operate. The FastDigest enzymes had been used and despite the protocol suggesting these enzymes take 5 minutes to digest, the bands seemed to show otherwise.
Meanwhile, the 8kb fragment of DNA was prepped using the gel extraction kit; the end solution was 50ul eluted plasmid DNA which is now stored in the -20C freezer.
Another attempt at digesting pGFP-rrnB with EcoRI and NheI
Once this had been accomplished, another attempt to digest the pGFP-rrnB plasmid DNA with the enzymes EcoRI and NheI was made to make sure that the enzymes work correctly if given enough time to operate. However it was decided that the contents of the digest mixture would be altered slightly to assure complete digestion:
4ul of EcoRI
4ul of NheI
10ul of pGFP-rrnB DNA
4ul of FastDigest buffer
28ul of sterile distilled water
Instead of allowing just 1 hour under incubation these digests were given 2 hours to digest under incubation. The resulting digest solution was then placed in the freezer for storage.
Further digests of the pGFP-"

Entrepreneurship
In previous years, iGEM had an entrepreneurship track. Teams were encouraged to build projects and focus around commercializing their work. For 2015, we're removing the track and introducing an award for entrepreneurship.
Note
In order to be considered for the Best Supporting Entrepreneurship award , you must fill out this page.
The Best Supporting Entrepreneurship award recognizes exceptional effort to build a business case and commercialize an iGEM project. This award is open to all teams to show that entrepreneurship is something all teams can aspire to do with their project. This award can go to an new project, or to a previous project that a team aimed to commercialize. Have you filed a provisional patent on your project/device/process? Have you raised money to build and ship products? Have you pitched your idea to investors and received money? Complete the entrepreneurship section on the 2015 Judging form and tell us what you did. As always in iGEM, the aim is to impress the judges!"
Aachen,2017,Team:Aachen#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," this complexly regulated system. All these transporters have been predicted in silico [19],      which helped us in modelling our system.
Why Arabidopsis thaliana?
Why did we use the seqeustration mechanism of A. thaliana for the integration into the vacuolar membrane.
Arabidopsis thaliana is one of the best described plants and is well known as model organism in plant physiology. A lot of research has been done in the past to decipher      the different genes of A. thaliana [22,23]. Moreover, the main mechanisms occurring salt tolerance, for example the ion channels responsible for a fast efflux of Na+ out      of the cell, are well described. Main cellular metabolic processes in A. thaliana and yeast are similar, so genes can be transferred easily from one organism to the other.
Allgemeiner Fact: müssen wir noch irgendwo einbringen.
In yeast cells, transport systems exist at both the plasma and organellar membranes, which mediates alkali metal cation fluxes with different substrate specificities and using      diverse mechanisms (e.g. primary active ATPases, secondary active symporters and antiporters, and passive channels).
Homologous Recombination
Homologous recombination is a powerful tool to make genome editing. It is a well-established technique for S. cerevisiae and generates integrations into the genome, that are stable      through generations. Such a characteristic is a big advantage in comparison to plasmid-systems. It also prevents horizontal gene transfer, which would be an issue with the plasmid      system. Especially when looking at antibiotic- resistances, but also at other genes, this is a big argument for us in terms of safety and responsibility to use homologous recombination in the lab.
(A) Homologous Recombination results in the ingetration     of our gene casette into the genome (B)
For the application it is incontrovertible that a stable integration into the genome is the right choice. The lower chance for horizontal gene transfer is in application even more      important than in the lab. High conservation of introduced genes is significant here, because loss or mutation of any introduced gene could easily lead to dysfunction. Moreover,      there is no need to maintain selection pressure with e.g. use of antibiotics in combination with antibiotic resistant cells. Another advantage is that we can use our lab strains      directly for application- testing.
Easy Clone Recombination Sites
Genome editing using homologous recombination needs good recombination sites. The sites have great influence on the level"

Based on the response from our game participants, we believe that the palette has successfully achieved our educational goals. Most of the players said that they realized the wonderful outcome from the mixing of colors. In addition, they provided a lot of novel ideas for the improvement of our game:
1. Players said that the game did not explicitly guide players to be aware of how the colors mix. We could have set the winning criteria to be getting a specific color block, or ask the players to create a specific color block for a certain number of times.
2. Other players said that the game can be designed into stage mode: different levels require different patterns of color mixing. In this way, the game will work better in achieving our goal. "",,,,"

Abstract
We tried to mutate the vector again and we failed again.

8.19.2012
We came back to the school on Friday night.
We had a meeting on Saturday, in which we discussed what we did and what we’re going to do. It was very helpful. We felt more united after the meeting.
The freshmen all came to the school over this weekend. It’s our duty to help them. So we got very busy. But that was fun.
8.20.2012
1. A senior student did a PCR for the template plasmid over the weekend. Then she did an electrophoresis. We can see from the photo that the duplication was successful. She also made a reaction system to do the restriction enzyme digestion. We used enzyme Afl II. To make all of us satisfied, the mutation was successful. She also transformed the plasmid into the body of a competent cell, and let it grow for one night.
2. The next step is to amplify the GFP and RFP which is not difficult. Here are our reaction systems.

Calgary riboregulator page
Abstract: Calgary 2007 wanted to design and build a biomechanical printer. The printer composed of a two dimensional plotter equipped with a red laser. The plotter would receive instruction from a software that can translate computer images into instructions. E. coli would respond to the laser light. The red laser light would trigger the expression of beta-agarase enzyme which can degrade the agar polymer that cell rest on. This would produce “bacterial lithography”, where the E. coli exposed to red laser light would dissolved that agar and form a picture.
For Calgary 2007’s project to work, they needed a precise control of the gene of interest. To have such control, they decided to use the riboregulator system to prevent accidental expression of gene of interest.

Schematic representation of Caltech 2007’s project design regulation
Abstract: Caltech 2007 wanted to engineer viruses to selectively kill or modify specific subpopulation of target cells, based on their RNA or protein expression profiles. To prove the concept, they decided to use bacteriophage λ and E. coli. Caltech 2007 tried to engineer a bacteriophage λ to target and lyse specific subpopulations of E. coli. In their design, the developmental genes of the virus essential for virus infection and survival are regulated by cis-repressing RNA (lock). Only the target E.coli contain the trans-activating RNA (key) to activate the expression of the virus developmental genes. Once the genes are activated, the target cells will go through the lysis process. Meanwhile, non-target cells won’t be affected by the virus because the non-target cells lack the key to activate the expression of the virus developmental genes.

Synthetic Cancer Killers
""Killer cells of the immune system identify cancer and pathogen-infected cells and kill them. These potent killers travel throughout the body, recognizing proteins and other molecules on the surface of cells. In order to differentiate between healthy and diseased cells, killer cells use a variety of receptors, which bind to specific ligands on the target cells’ surface. If the target cell is deemed potentially dangerous, the killer cell grips the target cell tightly and creates an immunological synapse at the site of adhesion. Within this immunological synapse, the killer cell releases cytotoxic granules to kill the target cell without harming nearby cells, triggering a directed apoptotic response.
Our team will focus on improving killer cells’ specificity and killing efficiency towards cancerous target cells. By using tools of synthetic biology, we hope to create powerful killing bio-machines to fight cancer. Our newly engineered synthetic devices would have the potential to enhance current adoptive cell-based immunotherapy for cancer patients.""
We believe that as long as the proper precautions are taken and the safety guidelines are followed, most potential safety concerns can be prevented. None of our genes, parts, or devices are considered potentially oncogenic or pathogenic which would require a safety rating above BSL1. We specifically chose not to use materials from known pathogens. A possible extra precaution to make parts, devices, and systems safer would have been to put suicide genes into the sequences to prevent unintended introductions of them into the environment, but this was less necessary based upon the components and systems we used.

""The development of sensitive and selective biosensors is an important research field in synthetic biology. Biosensors can be applied in a wide range of uses - from the detection of environmental toxics up to clinical diagnostics. Because cells have to sense their surroundings, there are a lot of natural systems that are similar to a biosensor. Prejudicial cellular biosensors often show negative side effects that complicate any practical application. Common problems are the limited use outside of a gene laboratory due to the use of genetically engineered cells, the low durability because of the usage of living cells and the appearance of undesired signals induced by endogenous metabolic pathways"

RDFZ-China is an active, collaborative team within the iGEM community in China. We share our resources and ideas aiming to create positive impacts on other iGEM teams we collaborated with.
Tsinghua
We provided team Tsinghua with IPTG assay with Ptac plasmid backbone in Tsinghua’s IPTG induction devices in their NEON system.Also we provided AHL for their Lux system.Tsinghua was generous to provide us some lab space and equipments to work on our projects. We worked close, both physically and intellectually, to create maximum impacts on our team projects.
SJTU-BioX-Shanghai
This year, we provided SJTU-BioX-Shanghai with plasmids expressing acoustic reporter genes arg1 and arg2. They were applied to report the location of cancer foci combining with ultrasound in their project “E.Coli for Colon Health Observation”. We also shared protocols and equipments regarding non-invasive bacteria monitoring in our section of gas vesicles.
Great Bay China
Zeyu Tang from the team, RDFZ-China, kindly provided help on modeling for team GBC. To be specific, Zeyu gave them one document about previous work he has done on the fermentor model, which contains deterministic ODEs for predicting the productivity of engineered bacteria in the fermentor. In addition, Zeyu wrote another document which illustrates the deduction of Hill equation, helping them create their model simulation.
Knowing GreatBay was constructing a constitutive expressing GFP into the bacterial genome, we enquired for it and used it as a capacity monitor for characterizing the expression burden. Greatbay kindly gave it to us as a gift.
BFSUICC-China
Our team leader in 2017, Bowen Xiao, did a report on strategies preparing the iGEM competition; then the two teams shared resources and had a conversation on the biggest problems encounter during iGEM. Team BFSUICC-China in September met with us to discuss project updates and Jamboree preparation.

Over time there is seen a reduction in the number of light spots indicating the spores are germinating. The two images below show the first and last image of the time lapse, side by side for comparison.
First image taken 13 minutes after initial addition of culture to germination pad
Last image taken 3 hours 2 minutes and 40 seconds after initial addition of culture to germination pad
There is a clear reduction in number of phase-bright spots, both the number decreases over time (see graph, above) and the intensity of remaining spots decreases. This is indicative of spores germinating.
Published data
The following shows figures from [ Wang et al. 2011 ], supporting the spoVA overexpression.
This experiment shows how overexpressed spoVA (strain PS3411) increases the rate of germination. The group isolated individual spores and followed their progress as they germinated using DIC microscopy (high Normalized intensity represent fully sporulated, low Normalized intensity represent fully germinated).
Wild Type B.subtilis, germinated on L-alanine at 25°C
strain PS3411 (overexpressed spoVA) B.subtilis, germinated on L-alanine at 25°C
On average spores germinated faster at 45°C for both wild type (WT) and PS3411. Even at 25°C PS4311 still appears to germinate quicker than WT.
Spores were heat shocked at 70°C for 30 minutes prior to measurement.

UI-Indonesia,2014,Team:UI-Indonesia#Human Practice#Expert Talking#aroem#_-_-_TEXT.html," (U.S. Food & Drug Administration, FDA). Biosimilar product that currently been commercialized is Erythropoietin Stimulating Drug. Erythropoietin is a hormone produced mainly in the kidneys, which stimulates the production and maintenance of red blood cells. Recombinant erythropoietin drugs are known as erythropoietin-stimulating agents (ESAs). These drugs are given by injection (shot) and work by stimulating the production of more red blood cells. These cells are then released from the bone marrow into the bloodstream. Until now, the synthetic biology commercialize product in only biosimilar product such as ESD or vaccine.
Is there any regulation about synthetic biology research in Indonesia?
About product commercialization, yes, there are some regulations. Such as:
1. UU 21/2005 about Genetically-modified Product Safety
2. For pharmacy product:
• Ministry of Health Regulation 1010/2008 about Drug Registration
• National Agency of Drug and Food Control Republic of Indonesia HK 03.123.10.11.08481/2011
However, there are no guidelines for researches in synthetic biology in Indonesia. IHVCB follows the NIH Guidelines For Research Involving Recombinant DNA Molecules (NIH Guidelines). Overall, research in synthetic biology in Indonesia is still free of use. This could be a good news because everyone can do researches and propose new ideas, but it could be bad if wrong people misuse this.
That’s why Universitas Indonesia is currently developing a new guideline for biosafety and risk assessment, which could be used generally all across Indonesia. This is the first one Indonesia will ever had! We intend to make boundaries or restrictions so it would reduce the risk of contamination or mutation in the environment or even human. It also contains materials about ethics, because until now ethics only a matter of perception through patient as a human being––there are no limit or boundary against it so the ethics perception between one person and another could be biased. For publication outside Indonesia, international safety guidelines like NIH should be fulfilled. That’s why; every research in UI should fulfill the NIH Guidelines and should pass the risk assessment test before being brought out from the lab. We’ve been listing our researches that have been conducted so we could categorize it.
How should we package our product? Could we use it as a probiotics? And how will people of Indonesia accept it?
If you’re trying to make a probiotics, be careful about the storage because it’ll has short term of expiration date. Back again, you should consider the"

Building a multi-detection device of STIs based on aptamers
Detecting STIs with aptamers requires to assemble numerous components together. So let’s identify the cornerstones and how to make them fit together!
Detection System
The detection system relies on 3 major functional blocks. Detection using a hook/target system Revelation, either fluorescence or latex beads Anchoring the system on paper
Detection using a hook/target system

Introduction to aptamers... 4 different couples of targets/aptamers were used:
Adenosine aptamer: This aptamer is able to catch adenosine derivatives (ATP, ADP, AMP and Adenosine). It has the ability to bind cooperatively two molecules.
Its sequence is                      TCACTGACCTGGGGGAGTATTGCGGAGGAAGGT Thrombin aptamers: as thrombin is the uppermost studied target of aptamers, we used it to make the proof of concept of the feasibility of protein detection.

Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus johnsonii and Lactobacillus acidophilus have been mentioned or tried to engineer in few iGEM projects. But there’s no evidence to show how they achieve.
Uppsala successfully engineered Lactobacillus reuteri in 2013. They developed the shuttle vectors based on pSB4C15, in which the replication origin was changed with a broad range replicon from the plasmid pJP059.  In addition, they also collected a series of useful biobricks working in probiotics including promoters and antibiotic resistance cassette. The promoter CP29 and erythromycin resistance gene were taken in our project.
TMMU_China is another iGEM team to successfully engineer the probiotic, Lactococcus lactis. Although they demonstrated the method and transformed Lactococcus, they didn’t create any BioBrick parts working on transforming the probiotic.
Our Approach
We have genetically engineered a probiotic which stably expresses the genes of interest. Based on the Uppsala’s method, the probiotic was transformed with shuttle vectors and selected by antibiotics. The bacteria have to maintain the plasmids in the pressure of the existence of antibiotics. Further, the concerns may be addressed with the possibilities of horizontal antibiotic gene transfer.
Lactobacillus acidophilus exists in your gut and is one of the most common probiotics added to your food supplements. Lactobacillus acidophilus strain NCFM has been produced and applied to commercial products and studied in many scientific papers including available full genome sequence information3. In addition, we could obtain them from a local Bioresource Collection and Research Center in Taiwan. Therefore, we decided to choose Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM as our chassis.
Chromosomal integration are stable for the engineered strain to express heterologous genes. We’d like to design and create the BioBrick vectors for transforming probiotics by inserting genes on chromosome through homologous recombination.

1 Promoting communication between classic science and synthetic biology
2 Educating junior high school students on synthetic biology
3 Cohosting iGEM Southern China Regional Meeting
In the interdisciplinary project, we focused on the communication between people from synthetic biology and other fields, such as behavioral psychology, optogenetics and brain imaging science. We hope that it will spark new ideas in using synthetic biology to study neuroscience and behavioral psychology. Meanwhile, this activity will also promote cutting edging development in synthetic biology to our fellow undergraduate student. Moreover, our engagement in public awareness successfully spread the knowledge of C. elegans and synthetic biology in neighboring communities.
Promoting communication between classic science and synthetic biology
People at the seminar
To promote communication between different fields and spread concept of synthetic biology, we co-hosted a seminar and a synthetic biology lecture with Prof. Zhihao Li at Shenzhen University. In the seminar, we shared the philosophy of synthetic biology, “build life to understand it”, and its engineering principle, methodology with Prof. Li. We also learned recent progress in the technology of brain imaging science. After the inspiring conversation, we purposed to deliver light-sensitive channels into necrotic neurons of human brain and activate them with light.
In the lecture, we mainly talked about synthetic biology and brain imaging science. In the first session, we gave the audience an introduction of the latest advancement of brain imaging method and the importance of integration it with synthetic biology approaches.

The Human Practice Story
This year UCL's iGEM team has addressed the subject of Policy and Practice with three central questions. The answers to which not only gave us valuable insight, but also guided our research to best benefit the world.
What does the Industry need?
Synthetic biology could be a powerful industrial and environmental tool, as our project hopes to demonstrate. As with the introduction of any new technology it is important to understand the problem that we are trying to solve with synthetic biology and the context into which our potential solution solution fits; not just in terms of the technological competition, but also in terms of policy making, legislation, the history of the problem, extant environmental and health data and even international relations. Though often overlooked in iGEM, we chose to look at this by creating a short, concise digest in the form of a mock POSTnote. A POSTnote is the standardised format by which the UK's Parliamentary Office of Science and Technology advises Parliament on science and technology issues. We suggest that following such a format could help iGEM teams contextualise their project better. Alongside our social media campaign we also contacted local government agencies, and used it to launch our engagement with the biggest name in dye policy, ETAD.
Download the Mock Parliamentary PostNote here
In a bid to further understand the industry requirements for an azo dye remediation project three of our team ventured to the head office of The Ecological and Toxicological Association of Dyes and Organic Pigments Manufacturers (ETAD) in Basel, Switzerland. We met with their Chief Director Walter Hofher along with Research and Development Directors from Bezema and Huntsman Dyeing Companies; Georg Roentgen and Dr Stefan Ehrenberg respectively.
We came out from the meeting with a much deeper understanding of the factory dyeing processes, current remediation strategies and the requirements of the entire industry.  The table below summarises what we learned and how it changed the direction of our project.
Composition of dye effluent: Effluent not only contains azo dyes that we can toxic to E.coli upon remediation but Copper and Chromium salts in addition.
From the knowledge we set out plans to test the toxicity of different concentrations of copper"

Hong_Kong_HKU,2018,Team:Hong Kong HKUST#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," CO2 into methane. Both substrates were intimately linked with our project: the CO2 was the sustainability problem we had to tackle, while methane was a substrate that could be processed by our Alkane Metabolism pathway. Seeing this connection, we asked for their permission to borrow their construct design to improve our system overall.
Originally, we meant to use E. coli bacteria to secrete laccase for PE plastic degradation and Shewanella, stored in the MFC, to house the alkane channel and alkane metabolism pathway. However, to integrate insights from both Professor Bookhart and the HKJS_S team, we decided to change our final system design into one single Bacterial Artificial Chromosome, so that our individual systems could be housed in one single cell to increase the automation of our project. This modification will be implemented upon successful attempts on PE degradation and Alkane metabolism. The new schematic is as follows:
As usual, laccase degrades PE into alkanes (refer to our PE degredation page for details). The AlkL gene (coding for Alkane outer membrane channel protein) allows larger alkanes to enter the transformed Shewanella and the ASS cluster allows the cell to process it (please see our Alkane metabolism page for details). In addition, we added a nitrogenase gene to convert the CO2 products into methane. The idea is that since methane can also be processed by the ASS cluster, CO2 produced by Shewanella during respiration can be recycled into the MFC system.
According to our modelling, carbon dioxide can be converted into methane after undergoing reduction process, in which the molecule uses the energy from the sun/catalyst to break up the CO2 molecule into carbon and oxygen atoms, then combine with hydrogen to form methane and water, as explained on the chemical equation below.
Using irreversible Henri-Michaelis-Menten Kinetics, we tried to consolidate an enzyme-catalyzed reaction with a single reaction and and reaction rate equation with Vmax of 0.8 ± 0.07 nmol/min and a Km for CO2 of 23.3 ± 3.7 mM [1].
From this graph, it can be seen that it takes over 3 hours to fully convert 10 nmol of CO2 into methane. It appears to verify that common features of homogeneous catalysts for CO2 reduction to CH4 are low reaction rates (e.g., turnover frequencies) and limited number of turnovers (e.g., turnover number) before inactivation of the catalyst [2].
Since laccase takes about 80 days"
UCL,2014,Team:UCL#Humans#Soci_-_-_TEXT.html," are under the influence of scientific human practice and technological innovations. These are issues that necessitate questions of sustainability as the environmental implications and discourses surrounding the production and application of knowledge imply that there are positive and negative effects of the latter when it comes to the state of the environment. A case study about sustainability research entails therefore a search for models and practices that appear to pave the way to achieve sustainable outcomes. Furthermore, it also means that the researcher has to be engaged with a topic that requires interdisciplinary interaction and processing data that are potentially unfamiliar to the eye of the social scientist. Nevertheless, sustainability research is ultimately about how the social factor interrelates or manifests itself in relation to other spheres, where a variety of disciplines can have differing perspectives on how a solution might be devised. When making an attempt to explore why iGEM and this team can provide an insight in understanding, and thus enhancing sustainable practice and outcomes, it is key to consider the complex (social) world as something that is unmistakeably beyond our control. Regardless whether the use of multiple variables can keep track of intricate changes, these complexities cannot be definitively reduced to the models of social phenomena we seek to create in the meantime (Evans 2011).
In social scientific research, the case study method is often not made explicit when researchers explore its methodological need because a predetermined case implies that the scope of the research is already a given. However, the motivation to answer a carefully constructed question on a sustainability issue, is juxtaposed with the kind of empirical work of a case study that would suffice to answer that question. Its rigour, scientific validity and appropriate use are therefore especially important when it comes to sustainability research considering that the multiple potentialities of actions, influences and outcomes require the simplicity and particularity of a case to demonstrate the scientific validity of the case in question (Evans 2011). A case study delineates the parameters of the subject in which the researcher is interested but does not disclose how it should be executed. To examine and analyse the UCL iGEM team of students or scientists in the making, it is important to actually look at what they do and say as practitioners of sustainability. Therefore, conducting an ethnographic study of this team can uncover some indications ‘about the ways sustainabilities are created, practiced and held to be true. Or they can tell us how the ‘ideal’ versions of sustainable living fail to take hold in the communities to which they affect’ (Enticott 2011: 39).
The ethnographic method in this case study primarily consists of conducting participant observation as a team of UCL iGEM 201"
EPFL,2018,Team:EPFL#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," newly characterized Cas12a (Cpf1) protein.
CRISPR-Cas (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats–CRISPR-associated) systems are originally inspired by an antiviral defense mechanism used by prokaryotes which work by recognizing and cleaving the foreign DNA/RNA. They have, in the recent years, widely been used as a gene editing tool for their ability to find and cut at a specific site allowing the insertion of a desired sequence. This target sequence is what we call the activator.
In the case of Cas12a this activator is composed of two different strands: the target strand (TS) and the non-target strand (NTS). The NTS requires a T-rich protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) sequence whereas the TS contains the sequence we want to detect. CRISPR scans all PAM sequences in the genome and compares its loaded guide RNA (gRNA) with all possible adjacent target sequences. When Cas12a finds its target, it undergoes a conformational change and cleaves the activator: its double stranded DNA (dsDNA) target.        It is also worth mentioning that Cas12a proteins retains the capacity to recognize and cleave ssDNA without any PAM sequence.
As a result of its conformational change upon target recognition, Cas12a unleashes a non-specific endonuclease activity (i.e. collateral cleavage) virtually against any single stranded DNA (ssDNA). Each activated Cas12a protein can cleave huge numbers of ssDNA molecules, and this is what makes this system so suitable for detection, as it greatly amplifies the signal. As explained more in detail in “Fluorescent readout”, by coupling this  property to a single-stranded FQ reporter, we can hugely increase even very small signals, which means higher sensitivity for this system.
In our assays we worked with the purified Lba-Cas12a (type V-A CRISPR) extracted from Lachnospiraceae bacterium ND2006 and provided by New England BioLabs .
Design of the gRNA
The gRNA must contain a 17 to 24bp complementary sequence to the dsDNA of interest. For activating Cas12a and further collateral cleavage, it is crucial that the activator incorporates a T-rich PAM sequence, TTTN, 5’ of the target sequence. Once the protein has recognized the PAM sequence and the gRNA has bound the complementary sequence, the staggered cut will occur around 18 bases 3′ of the PAM"

They behave unobtrusive until they leave their familiar habitat and become pathogens of urinary tract infections, Sepsis and natal meningitis. Although these findings are concerning horizontally transferred genes are mostly acquired for the purpose of surviving and fitness. For instance the expression of the aerobactin iron uptake system is important for the fitness of strain Nissle 1917, as the availability of free iron in the human body is limited. Thus, together with the expression of other systems involved in iron acquisition the aerobactin system contributes to competitiveness, survival, and colonization. From the authors point view, the presence of six different determinants involved in iron uptake is noteworthy and seems to contribute to the great adaptability and fitness of E. coli strain Nissle 1917.
A very efficient iron acquisition system, which bacteria including E. coli use are siderophore mediated transport pathways.                 We tested the probiotic E. coli Nissle 1917 strain because of its additional iron acquisition systems. Since this E. coli strain is not a laboratory strain we addressed its safety in our safety section.
Additionally, we attempted to knockout two genes that regulate the iron uptake systems in E. coli. First, the ferrous iron efflux transporter (FieF) which belongs to the cation diffusion facilitator family and is responsible for transporting excessive iron out of the cytosol into the cell environment. Another, relevant regulator for the iron homeostasis is the ferric uptake regulator (fur) -which was previously topic of another iGEM project. However, by knocking out both of these genes we hope to increase the iron content inside of the cell in order to load our ferritin proteins more efficiently.[2]

They explained that in principle it would be possible to structure Au nanoparticles on top of a small 0.14 mm             fiber with experimental electron-beam processing (e-beam). But this would prohibit using normal             commercial litography systems like UV-litography which are state of the art right now.
Figure 1: Mr. Scholz showing us the lab
All commercial litography systems are optimized to work with thin wafers.             The space inside these machines prohibits placing long fibers in them.             The vast share of the cost of producing nano structures lies in the price of the machines.             If standard semiconductor machines are used like UV-litography,             then the price per chip in mass production can be cut to a couple of dollars.
During the discussion, we changed our setup from placing the Au nano structure on top of the fiber to placing             it on standard glass wafers. This greatly reduces the cost of the wafer and markets the wafer as a disposable part,             that you change once you want to measure a different molecule.
Figure 1: In the cleanroom
In another meeting, Mr. Scholz also gave us a tour of their clean room and machines.             It is really impressive what kind of effort goes into making those small nano structures.             Just the machines for clean non-ionized water are as big as two student dorms.

Hardware Optimization: From Reflection to Transmission
We met with Dr. Mourran, group leader for Thermoplasmonics of Nanoparticles at the DWI Leibniz Institute for Interactive Materials.             His group uses Plasmon Resonance to liquify hydrogels.             He is an expert in the application of Plasmon Resonance and the different setups available.             With his input we changed our approach from reflection to transmission.
The reason we approached him, was to talk about a possible partnership to manufacture the Au nano particles.             He was quite intrigued, but could not help us with the manufacturing, as they did not have the necessary machinery.             But he could lend us his expertise. Firstly, he taught us a lot about the actual physics, what Plasmon Resonance is and how they use it.             With his applied knowledge in using Plasmons for thermal purposes, we learned how all the different parameters influence Plasmon Resonance.

Producing a GFP-REACh Fusion Protein
In our project, we reproduced the REACh1 and REACh2 proteins by subjecting an RFC-25 compatible version of the BioBrick E0030 (EYFP) to a QuikChange mutation, creating the BioBricks K1319001 and K1319002 . Subsequently, we fused each REACh protein with GFP (mut3b) which is available as BioBrick E0040 . The protein complex was linked via a protease cleavage site ( K1319016 ). As constitutive promoter we use J232101 . When GFP is connected to either REACh quencher, GFP will absorb light but the energy will be transferred to REACh via FRET and is then emitted in the form of heat; the fluorescence is quenched. Our cells also constitutively express the LasR activator. Together with the HSL molecules from P. aeruginosa, LasR binds to the LasI promoter that controls the expression of the TEV protease, which we made available as K1319004 . When the fusion protein is cleaved by the TEV protease, REACh will be separated from GFP. The latter will then be able to absorb and emit light as usual.
Composition of our biosensor
For our biosensor, we use a mix of already available and self-constructed BioBricks.
The resulting fusion proteins can be expressed in K1319013 (GFP fused with REACh1) and K1319014 (GFP fused with REACh2). The linker between the proteins containing a TEV protease cleavage site is labelled as K1319016 .
Since we did not have enough time to build the complete system we tested our FRET reporter with an IPTG inducible TEV protease ( K1319008 ). In this way we were able to establish a proof of concept of our reporter system including proper expression of the TEV protease as well as functionality of our GFP-REACh construct.
Composition of our biosensor for IPTG
To test the funtionality of our sensor concept, we expressed the TEV protease with a T7 promoter.

Dr. Ir. Tom de Greef (1980) was born in Eindhoven, the Netherlands, and studied at the University of Eindhoven                 (TU/e), where he received his MSc degree in Biomedical Engineering cum laude in 2004. He completed his PhD at                 the Department of Chemistry at the same university in 2008 with professors E. W. Meijer and R. P. Sijbesma,                 working on novel polymeric materials based on quadruple hydrogen bonding motifs. Subsequently, he moved to the                 Biomodeling and Bioinformatics group headed by prof. P. A. J. Hilbers at the Department of Biomedical                 Engineering (TU/e), studying self-assembling systems from a computational perspective. He also became assistant                 professor at this department in 2010. In 2013, Tom de Greef was a visiting scholar in the group of Prof. D. Weitz                 (Harvard) working on protein affinity screening using droplet microfluidics. Current research themes are                 centered on the engineering of artificial cellular systems (bottom-up synthetic biology) with the aim to                 rationalize physicochemical design principles of biological systems and to develop novel biotechnological                 applications. In this multidisciplinary work he combines his fascination for (bio)chemistry, mathematical                 modeling, microfluidics and complex systems. In 2012 and 2013 he was awarded a VENI and an ECHO-STIP grant                 respectively by the Netherlands Organization of Scientific Research (NWO). He is also core member of the"

Bielefeld-CeBiTec,2016,Team:Bielefeld-CeBiTec#Project#Modeling#Model II_-_-_TEXT.html," similar (figure 1 (A), exponential phase). To account for varying growth behavior at the beginning and an almost uniform behavior after a certain time, we had to work with a dynamical r. After fitting the growth curves of our theoretical model to the experimentally measured ones, we observed a change of the growth rate r at an OD of about 0.38.
As we could not find information about the behavior of different adapted E. colis together in one flask, we performed another experiment for further improvement of our mathematical model.  Therefore, we cultivated two different adapted JS200 cultures, culture A and culture B, together in one flask. To be able to compare the two cultures we transformed a GFP labeled plasmid in culture A and an RFP labeled plasmid in culture B. Culture B had a little disadvantage with respect to growth in comparison to culture A.  As a control we also cultivated the cultures alone. The experiments were performed with 1:1 A to B and 1:9 A to B proportion of the two different cultures to be able to study the behavior in detail.
Figure 3: Growth (A), GFP (B) and RFP (C) curves of differently well growing cultures and culture mixtures.
Culture A is a well growing E. col culture containing a GFP labeled plasmid and culture B a badly growing culture containing a RFP labeled plasmid. A 1:1 B is a culture mixture which contains an equal amount of culture A and B and A 9:1 B is a culture mixture which contains a proportion of 9:1 A to B.
As can be seen in figure 2 (A) the culture mixtures do not reach the same high plateau as the separately cultivated culture A. Still they reach a higher plateu as the separately cultivated culture B.  This means that the reproduction rate is influenced by different cultures.  Also in figure 2 (B) it can be seen that the curve of the culture mixtures lies in between culture A and B, but the curve resembling the culture mixtures with A 9:1 B is nearly the same as the curve representing culture A.  Thus, it can be seen that in the culture mixture culture A grows normally, but can not reach the same final OD.  It can also be seen that in the 1:1 culture mixture the GFP concentration is not that much lower compared to the concentration in the separately cultivated culture A. This means that culture B does not influence the growing of culture A.  Figure 2 (C) shows that in the culture mixtures"

We have designed the basic functional parts including gdh, cI protein, emrR protein and emrR binding promoter. Gdh and cI protein is well character by using SDS-Page gel electrophoresis and western blot. These parts can worked well separately in E.coli when cultivated in LB medium containing appropriate amount of sAmp antibiotics and IPTG inducer.
In our project, gdh works as a growth factor that successfully accelerated the growth of bacteria, which is clearly showed in figure1A. Gdh is a 89kDa protein and in our design, we added V5-tag to the C-terminus of the coding sequence, so we can process the SDS-Page gel electrophoresis and western blot (figure1B) to make sure it is gdh that cause the growth acceleration.
Fig.1 Demonstrations of gdh.cI protein is a 47kDa protein with V5-tag in C-terminus. We also use the electrophoresis and western blot to insure the expression of cI (figure2).
Fig.2 Demonstrations of cI.
Besides, we created the loop described in Figure 3a to test the function of emrR protein and its binding promoter. Bacteria is induced by SA. By monitoring the fluorescent density and its ratio to the OD value in the bacteria (Figure3), we confirm that emrR protein and its binding promoter can correctly work and have the potential to be used in integrated plasmids.

Slovenia,2012,Team:Slovenia#TheSwitchDesignedTALregulators_-_-_TEXT.html," the KRAB repression domain. (B) TAL activator; fusion of TAL DNA-binding domain with the VP16 activation domain. Expression of TAL effectors is under the control of constitutive CMV promoter. (C) Reporter plasmids used to test efficiency of TAL regulators. TAL DNA-binding sites are placed upstream of either a CMV promoter (repression) or a minimal promoter (activation), driving the expression of reporter genes (firefly luciferase or mCitrine).
The TAL transcriptional activators and repressors were basic tools in our iGEM project. We designed and characterized three functional TAL regulators ( TALA , TALB and TALD ) by fusing TAL DNA-binding domains (Sander et al., 2011) with the VP16 activation domain (Figure 3B) or a KRAB repression domain (Figure 3A), as shown on Figure 2. To assess the activity of designed TAL regulators, we also designed reporter plasmids , which contain several repeats of TAL binding sites upstream of either a CMV promoter (repression) or a minimal promoter (activation) (Figure 3C).
In addition to the synthesis of new TAL effector-based parts and their characterization, our team also improved a part which was deposited in the Registry by the Slovenian iGEM2010 team. They synthesized a TAL effector, named NicTAL , which did not work as expected in mammalian cells. We discovered that a subdomain next to the DNA-binding domain was missing, because the requirements for the functional TAL binding domains have not been known two years ago. We linked the missing subdomain to the DNA-binding domain of NicTAL from the Registry. Additionally we prepared chimeric proteins of the NicTAL-DNA binding domain and KRAB or VP16 domains, generating another repressor and activator pair and demonstrated the newly acquired functionality of the NicTAL-based regulators.
Designed repressors
We designed and tested three different variants of TAL DNA-binding domain fusions with the KRAB repression domain. KRAB was placed either on both termini or on the N- or C-terminus of the TAL DNA-binding domain (Figure 3A). All tested constructs offour different TAL domains exhibited over 90% repression of the reporter plasmid (with the exception of KRAB:TALD ). We expected to observe a difference in repression due to potential clustering of KRAB-binding proteins, but no significant variation between constructs was noticeable. Our conclusion is that"

Biofilm formation on surfaces is an issue in the medical field, naval industry, and other areas. We developed an anti-fouling peptide with two modular components: a mussel adhesion protein (MAP) anchor and LL-37, an antimicrobial peptide. MAPs can selectively attach to metal and organic surfaces via L-3,5-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA), a nonstandard amino acid that was incorporated using a genetically recoded organism (GRO). Because this peptide is toxic to the GRO in which it is produced, we designed a better controlled inducible system that limits basal expression. This was achieved through a novel T7 riboregulation system that controls expression at both the transcriptional and translational levels.

Figure 9. Production rate of holin at oxygen levels of 2000 and lactate levels of 10
Figure 10 shows the production of LuxI and LuxR with maximally inducing oxygen levels, about 250, but no lactate. There is much LuxR being produced, but no LuxI and thus no HSL. In the model, it turned out to be difficult to turn the system completely off, as long as there were lactate present, even in small amounts. This is probably not realistic, as V. fischeri has a constant production of both LuxR and LuxI without inducing luminescence.
The last plot shows the response to high oxygen levels; 5000, and high lactate levels; 100. this gives a response similiar to the one in Figure 9 were holin is produced, but forms a complex with antiholin and does not reach large enough quantities to cause lysis.

Modelling for RHIT
Our part of the collaboration with RHiT was helping them with stochastic modelling of the trigger system for mating in yeast. The full mechanism has been quite well studied, but it is very complicated [17] . In RHiTs model , the final steps of the mechanism is activation of the Ste12 protein by the Fus3 enzyme. To simplify the model, production of Fus3 in the model was described by a sigmoid curve found in experiments [18] with respect to the concentration of α-pheromone. Inactive Ste12 was quickly activated by the presence of Fus3, so the outcome of active Ste12 followed a similar sigmoid curve, giving the expected switch behaviour. The resulting plot is shown in Figure 1. Each point is the average of 100 trajectories with the error bars indicating one standard deviation.
Figure 1. Amount of activated Ste12 at steady state as a response to α-pheromone concentrations. Error bars show one standard deviation.
The equations used in the model are given in the table below. The parameters are taken from [1] and are modelled using mass action solvers, except Fus3 → Fus3PP, which use a sigmoid function. Timesteps in the model are minutes.

Tuesday, 7/17/12  - Uros - By tonight will have a google doc up of his plan for the primers for the tethering and making the split CFP construct (in parallel). There was a mistake in one of the primers, but he caught it. Received an email back about split GFP, and got referred to another person. Will email her tonight and hopefully will get a sequence. If cloning/tethering doesn’t work by Monday, will send out constructs for sythesis.  - Anthony - still working on putting WT PUF in pBAD. Ran a gel and extracted from yesterday’s digests. There’s no band for pBAD. So starting 3 new digestions from different minipreps of pBAD. Hopefully will get some result from that, because can’t start ligation until the pBAd digest works.  - Asha - old plates of YFP constructs had weird growth 4 days. Uros and I looked at them and didnt think that they were fluorescing. Working on a positive and negative control to look at fluorescence. Negative will DH5a and positive will be E0030 subcloned into ptet (working with Angela on that.)  - Divya - working on biobricking WT PUF. PCRed more WT PUF. Isiah will run the gel on them tonight. Also poured Amp and CM plates (10 of each). Still waiting for the alkanes to arrive, so the Washington characterization is delayed. Isiah will call the company to see what is taking so long.
Thursday, 7/19/12  - Uros - no meeting yesterday because Uros and Angela discussed the format of the daily meeting. A big reason why the meetings run so late is because people are late. JUST BE PUNCTUAL! If you have a legit reason for being late, text everyone to let them know. If you miss a meeting look at this google doc to look at everyone else’s work and also be sure to update the google doc for the lab notebook. Come in tomorrow with a brief checklist of your project goals for the end of the summer so that everyone can be updated and be ready to start participating in quality discussions about all the separate projects. The google doc on which to share these summaries has been shared with everyone.  - Uros - trying to make a split"

""Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world."" – Nelson Mandela
Policy and practices has been a major part of our project because Edible coli has many ethical issues.  We want to raise awareness about GMO legislation, as well as get better knowledge about the general opinion on eating  bacteria. To achieve this we have made a questionnaire, presented our project, published an article in the university newspaper and organized a Microorganism Quiz Night.
To get an even deeper and completely comprehensive discussion, one of our team members traveled to Ghana and interviewed two scientists with expert knowledge on nutrition in Ghana.  Additionally, we have made a business plan with which we present a possible final product idea. And last but  not least we have made a video adventure that is both entertaining and educational. Try it out, and learn more  about bacteria and GMOs here.
Questionaire
In mid summer we made a questionnaire, which was accessible for 2 months. It was only meant to be  answered by people connected to a University, as we assume that people with an educational  background have the possibility to rule on various issues. The questionnaire explained GMOs for the sake of the participants who had not heard of it. The purpose of the questionnaire was supposed to give us a better idea of how much people know about GMO and what the common opinion is about"

Agent-Based Modeling
Introduction
Compared to traditional modeling tools, such as ODE, PDE and many other numerical methods, the Agent-Based Modeling bases itself on the discrete modeling of individual behaviors, in which the agent choose his actions according to the circumstances. The most intriguing part of ABM is that the overall phenomenon emerging from many agents can be discovered, not verified, which is a regular case in equation modeling methods. So, the reason why we use ABM in our model is that:
Give a comprehensive analysis of our artificial system
Discover possible problems or unexpected results
Visualize the regional behavior of a colony
Modeling Details
NetLogo Prototype
At first, we constructed a simple model based on NetLogo.
Specification
Agent: C.crescentus
Environment: 2-D Plate, with solid surface (where enough nutrition may exist) scattered at certain places; the light can also effect the cell's attaching behaviors
Behavior: The agent cell have two state: swimmer and attached. In the previous state, the cell will move around the plate in a nearly random discipline, and when it get near to the solid surface, its holdfast will attach to the surface so it can intake the nutrition from surface. When reaching a certain level of nutrition accumulation, the cell will reproduce another cell.
Version 1: Light Control
Usage: After setup, you can toggle the Light on GUI panel, and the cells' growth curve will be affected by the light. When the light is on, the cell's movement will be inhabited temporarily.
Version 2: Attaching Visualization
This is trying to simulate the scenarios in which the C.crescentus goes around and get attached.

Celllab
Celllab is a bio computing framework I am developing, enlighten by the using of NetLogo. The reason why we decide to develop such a web-based, flexible framework is that it is very tempting to give user the ability to customize the modeling running arguments, seeing what happens instantly in a single browser, and be freed from (maybe) heavy computing burden.
Except for the essential interface, such as a mini server written based on Node.js, we"

●
We used the mini prep of meffRed to run a PCR and then ran the PCR product on a gel and performed a gel extraction. The gel showed strong bands (stronger than we had seen in previous gels using the previously prepped meffRed) at around 2070 base pairs and after the gel extraction we ended with a higher nano drop concentration than previously seen.
●
We used this meffRed backbone and previously PCRed his-tags and chromoproteins to re do the Gibson assembly of the 4 plates that did not show colonies (MP, SP, DM, DT).

Collaborations
Collaboration between teams is crucial for the health of a project. As each team has a variety of skills, collaborating is the best way to improve all the iGEM projects.
Evry Paris-Saclay team
We met the Evry Paris-Saclay team in Paris during the 3rd Parisian meetup. Evry Paris-Saclay team project is focusing on the production of D-Psicose, which might be helpful for diabetic patients. Unlike us, their team has knowledge about legislation and market study that none of us has. On the other hand, our team has skills in biochemistry, structural biology and in enzymology.
After few skype conferences, a collaboration was born! Therefore, we offered them our help to study the enzyme responsible for the conversion of D-fructose and D-psicose , the D-Psicose-3-Epimerase (EC 5.3.1) (see here) and members of Evry Paris-Saclay team offered us help with the regulatory framework of GMO research and the release in the market of our product. You can check out their research here .
We would like to thank Evry Paris-Saclay team for their marvelous work !
Collaboration with UNebraska-Lincoln
UNL iGEM team contacted us to collaborate on their human pratices. Each member of our team responded to their survey about the methane production and inhibition. Our answers interested them because GMO is a sensitive topic in our country. You can check out our research on GMOs study here .
Project postal card exchange
Thanks to the Cologne-Duesseldorf team, we took part to the postal card exchange program. This was a great opportunity for us to share with other iGEM team our project and the iGEM experience. We also received a lot of postcards coming from other iGEM teams. We were excited to read about their projects and to learn more about their iGEM experiences.
We would like to thank the Cologne-Duesseldorf team. We really look forward to meet all the teams at the Giant Jamboree !

Also decided to miniprep more of the plasmid that was used for the ligations.  This includes pRS306, Z0279 (which had been chosen by mistake), Z0842 (which requires another scheme for ligation into pRS306), and Z0507 (which we might need should the current ligation into pRS306 fail).
However, decided against doing this tonight because the only available LB + Amp media appeared to have chunks of some white cloudiness.  Does not appear to be contamination, but will leave it out on the table overnight to make sure.  (Also, it did not make sense to add antibiotic to the remaining 50 mL of plain and clear LB because of the small mass of antibiotic required (0.5 mg).
6/25/08
--------------------------------------------------
To Do:
Ask Adrian if we can use a bit of any restriction enzymes that will work to cut the plasmid fragment from ZO842
Do that restriction digest.
Gel purify ZO507 & ZO842
Ligate these into yeast vector

GENESOCKET DATA AND STRATEGY!
GeneSocket uses a plasmid, a circuit and a strain to construct circuits on chromosome by lambda-red and ecombinase-derived bistable switch. BBa_K1433018, which is called SOCKET, is a circuit need to be recombined on chromosome by a helper plasmid BBa_K1433013, called SUPPORT DEVICE.!
TO achieve our project, we designed 8 exquisite circuits, 3 on plasmid and 5 on chromosome. See our Circuit Strategy.pdf !
TO construct this circuit, we use GBclonart Seamless Assembly Kit.
TO prepare segments which the kit required and to test circuit accuracy, we designed hundreds of primers. See our Primer.pdf !
TO use these segments which have prepared by using the primers through assembly kit , we did lots of PCR. See our PCR Strategy.pdf !
TO get some segments which cannot find in The 2014 DNA Distribution Kit, we designed 4 fragments and acquire them by de novo synthesis. See our Total Synthesis Strategy.pdf!
TO assembly these segments and construct our circuits by assembly kit, we did lots of work. See our Assembly Kit.pdf !
TO verify the accuracy of constructed circuits, we choose colony PCR. See our Colony PCR.pdf !
TO recombine these circuit on chromosome"

Lethbridge,2017,Team:Lethbridge#Software_-_-_TEXT.html," Choose 20)*20! possible combinations. Or put another way, 4.77 x 10^34 entirely novel genetic codes within which to encrypt a harmful DNA sequence.
GRecoS (Genetic Recoding Space)
That's 47 decillion, or 47 million billion billion billion genetic codes. Even at the lower bound, this is an extremely large sample space to search iteratively. Despite the size of the sample space, it remains to be seen whether or not this relationship is cryptographically strong. The program used to perform this calculation can be found on our GitHub page.
Check out GRecoS on the CODONxCHANGE GitHub repository!
Our estimation of the full genetic code sample space, including functionally redundant genetic codes is as above. However, it should be noted that this is an estimation of the upper limit of the coding space and may overestimate the true diversity of the given coding space.
Preliminary Testing
The potential for harm as a result of this technology is not to be underestimated. If recoded systems become as prevalent and easy to obtain as we expect them to be, control over where DNA containing funtional toxin sequences are distributed greatly diminishes. Accordingly, we reached out to gene synthesis companies to determine whether or not current bioinformatic technologies can detect radically recoded toxin sequences. For most of our analysis, we selected alpha conotoxin because it is short, lethal, and previously described as a potential threat in the paper Conotoxins: Potential Weapons from the Sea in the Journal of Bioterrorism and Biodefense.
Detecting Encrypted Sequences
A total of five companies from the IGSC (n=5) of the 11 possible agreed to test our sequences. Two control sequences were sent along with the encrypted sequences: unencrypted GFP and unencrypted conotoxin. The remaining 10 sequences consisted of equal numbers of encrypted GFP and conotoxin.

The project
One of processes currently implemented to clear the wastewater from its contaminants is bioremediation.
It embraces processes that use microorganisms to remove pollutants from a contaminated environment.
This rather  new approach, is especially interesting in the treatment of sparsely contaminated effluents.

The activity of ECOL was found to be increased in presence of low concentrations (1 % v/v) of either  MeOH or acetonitrile resulting in an higher amount of oxidized ABTS after 5 hours. Increasing concentrations of either substance decrease this positive effect, resulting in a significantly decreased laccase activity in presence of 8 % (v/v) MeOH. These results indicate that for further measurements in substrate analytics it is recommended not to use high concentrations of MeOH or acetonitrile to ensure the functionality of ECOL .
Figure 20: Standard ECOL activity test applying different amounts of MeOH. No considerable impact on the activity can be detected.
Figure 21: Standard ECOL activity test applying different amounts of acetonitrile. No considerable impact on the activity can be detected.
Since Regionals: Initial activity tests of purified fractions
Another cultivation of ECOL has been done after the Regional Jamboree in Amsterdam. The fractions of the purifictaion were analyzed further on protein content and re-buffered subsequently into deionized H2O. To determine the protein content afterwards because of loss of proteins through re-buffering, another protein concentration measurement has been done. The re-buffered fractions have been incubated with 0.4 mM CuCl2 to gain higher activity of the laccases, because they are copper-dependent. Standard activity tests were done with all ECOL fractions with adjusted protein content for comparison. The experimental setup included the ECOL fractions, Britton-Robinson buffer (pH 5) and 0.1 mM ABTS. Measurements were done at 25 °C. Resulting, one fraction showed very high activity in comparison to the other fractions (see Fig. 22). This fraction, fraction 50% 2, oxidized up to 23 µM ABTS after 5 hours. The first number of the sample indicates the percentage of used elution buffer, whereas the second number stands for the fraction number of this elution. This fraction was set as containing 90 % ECOL laccase of the whole protein content. Therefore a ECOL concentration of 63,9 µg mL-1 was gained. This fraction was analyzed further on pH optimum, temperature dependency and ABTS saturation.

The first verification of the part was done by digestion of the purified plasmid. Six colonies were chosen and digested with EcoRI and PstI the desired bands were 2029 bp and 2658 bp. The results of the digestion is shown in figure 24.
Figure 24: Digest verification of 6 potential colonies of composite part BBa_K2355302. 1kb ladder. Wells 2,5,8,11,14,17 double cut with EcoRI and PstI. wells 3,6,9,12,15,18 single cut with EcoRI. The rest of the wells are uncut.
None of the digestions gave the expected bands. Therefore, a PCR was also run on BBa_K2355302 with iGEM verification primers: BBa_G00100 and BBa_G00101. But showed no bands of the expected length.
The results of the digestion and PCR showed that the assembly of BBa_K2355302 had not worked.
Assembly of composite lacZ part (BBa_2355313)
Using basic digestion/ligation based assembly of parts, we were able to assemble a composite part, consisting of a coding sequence for ScAvidin with BBa_B0030 RBS, and the coding sequence for an empirical protein linker. This has been confirmed by sequencing. We were also able to attach a promoter (BBa_R0010) to this composite part, and we were able to PCR-amplify a lacZ coding sequence to prepare the BBa_I732005 lacZ part for assembly using the RFC[25] standard.
However, while assembling the lacZ part with the RBS + ScAvidin + linker part, we might have encountered some STAR activity from our restriction enzymes, as the finalised lacZ part only contains fractions of the ScAvidin molecule, in contrast to the intermediates, where all of the ScAvidin was present.
Figure 25: Picture of 1% agarose gel with 1 kb NEB ladder. It shows the PCR product of a lacZ part (BBa_I732005). The bands correspond well with the fact that lacZ is ~3000 bp long.
The finalised composite lacZ plasmid was digested with BseRI to verify that the Scavidin part + RBS was there. If inserted correctly, two bands would be visible at ~6000 bp and ~1000 bp respectively. The"

Antibacterial Stock Preparation (starter pack)
Introduction
The preparation of antibiotic stock is a relatively simple series of mixing and dilutions. The antibiotic stocks are typically made from four antibiotics: Ampicillin, Kanamycin, Tetracycline and Chloramphenicol. With the exception of chloramphenicol, the other antibiotics are light sensitive and once stock is prepared they are wrapped in foil to reduce light exposure.
An antibiotic comes in a powder form as the basic stock and is mixed with milli-Q water to form a stock solution. Antibiotic stock preparation follows the same basic process for each antibiotic, varying only in concentration which is dependent on the type of antibiotic used.
Antibiotic stocks are prepared for use either in liquid or solid media. In the case of liquid media, the antibiotic stock is simply added and mixed in. For solid media, usually agar and LB, the media is sent for autoclaving, and while the media is still hot the antibiotic is added and mixed. This is to ensure that the antibiotic can be mixed evenly amongst the media before it solidifies into a solid state.
Antibiotics are used for the purpose of selection. In terms of synthetic biology, plasmids confer selective antibiotic resistance when successfully transformed into their target bacteria. Using liquid or solid growth media that has been treated with antibiotics provides a selection control for those bacteria that have successfully incorporated the plasmid.
Basic Terminology and Concepts
There are some terms which will be commonly used to describe the preparation of antibiotic stocks. Familiarity and understanding of these terms is key to comprehend the protocol.
Milli-Q: Water that has been purified through successive steps of filtration and deionization. The standard used in our lab is typically 18.2MΩ·cm at 25°C, measured in resistance due to the lack of ions. The filters used are 0.22μm in size to ensure a high level of purity. This water is used for preparing our antibacterial stock to ensure purity.
LB (Lysogeny Broth): a very standard and simple media to create due to its recipe consisting of 3 components - tryptone, yeast extract, and sodium chloride. This mix of anhydrous ingredients is added to water and then autoclaved, producing liquid media. The production of solid LB for plates is done by adding agar, a protein isolated from certain species of seaweed which coagulates the liquid into a gel-like form when cooled. This is done prior to autoclaving and is poured into the plates while still hot,"

Introduction
After last year’s astonishing Interlab Study results, teams were again asked to take part in the biggest collaboration in the iGEM competition. All teams were asked to characterize the fluorescence for three different GFP devices in relation to each other.  This enables an assessment of the devices robustness during use in different laboratories.
Using the gBlocks provided for the study, we built the constructs and transformed them into E. coli DH10beta. The cells were cultured overnight in LB medium containing chloramphenicol as described in the Protocols . Correct cloning was ensured by plasmid miniprep and test restriction.  GFP fluorescence was measured in a TECAN plate reader with 488nm excitation wavelength and 520nm emission. We measured three biological replicates with three technical replicates each.
The three promotors are characterised by the iGEM-Team Berkeley in 2006 resulting in the following relative strengths:
J23101 1791 (Device 1)
J23106 1185 (Device 2)
J23117 162 (Device 3)
It was therefore expected, that the construct in Device 1 would produce the highest fluorescence, followed by Device 2 and with a strongly lower fluorescence, Device 3.
Results
We tested the fluorescence intensity produced by three combinations of a varying promoter coupled to the GFP gene.
Our results show, that Device 1 yields a higher fluorescence than the positive control, while Devices 2 and 3 present far lower fluorescence levels. The fluorescence of Device 3 is higher than that of Device 2, which is surprising as the promoter in device 2 was shown previously to have a much higher expression level."

If communication and more importantly interaction between scientists and the general public appears to be essential, another big question comes to the mind: which stance should the scientist adopt in the discussion process? Do his competences give him authority to stand above the general public? Prof. Trono insists:  “We [scientists] have to constantly be discussing with the public. However we must not present ourselves as those who know everything, compared to the uneducated crowd that awaits for a magic kit that works by simply pushing a few buttons”. Such position requires the scientist to step  back from his everyday research and from his own interests in order to get an overall view of the situation, which, as Prof François Lefort, biologist and member of the Parliament of the State of Geneva  underlines, is not easy: “One must bear in mind that a scientist does not only work to discover things, even if that is exciting [...]”, he told us, “But he then has to take the necessary time to understand  and reflect upon his discovery, to realize whether it is dangerous or not. It is not only philosophical, but very human. [...] It is a matter of survival”.
We also asked Prof. Lazare Benaroyo, ethicist and researcher at the University of Lausanne, about the position of the scientist in the information process. “I believe that interacting with the public and participating in the information process is part of the scientist’s responsibility”, he says, “It is a central matter. We hear people say: yes of course, we have to inform people because we have to respect their will, and for them to express it, they have to be informed. The problem is that when we are informing, we are already giving our own vision of things. So is it really an information?”. This analysis brings up another issue: scientists do not learn how to discuss their field of research with the general public and other experts such as humanities specialists. “It has to be taught to researchers during their training”, Prof. Benaroyo affirms, “A researcher has to be able to step back and question his own work”.
Responsibility
Recently, CRISPR-Cas9 has generated a heated debate on the way it could be used in gene therapy, which has led us to investigate the issue of the responsibility of the outcomes of scientific research. We asked the public in Lausanne about it, and the main answer was neither “the people” nor “politicians”, but by"

Principle:
Limulus anti-LPS factor (LALF) binds LPS on anti-gram negative bacterial surface tightly, forming a biofilm. This can prevent nutrient from entering the cell, causing the growth inhibition.
Also, the biofilm can prevent Plasmid spreading to the environment and gene pollution.
Besides, to make LALF across the cell membrane and bind to LPS, we still need  an efficient protein export signal sequence of E. coli. leading LALF into extra-cellular environment.
