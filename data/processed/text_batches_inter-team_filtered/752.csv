METU_HS_Ankara,2016,Team:METU HS Ankara#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," best candidate was butyrate. The research about butyrate’s effects on colon cancer has been done by Dr. Sreeparna Banerjee’s lab from Biological Science Department at METU, also encouraged us to focus on Butyrate.
Defining The Problem
Our project handle two main questions. First question was, “Is the colon cancer formation correlated with unhealthy diet such as non-fiberous diet and increase in consumption of carbohydrates?” Second one is,”Does the reduction of butyrate producing bacteria directly or indirectly lead to colon cancer formation?” and we have designed our project accordingly to get answer to these questions. Based on our collaborative work with research from Biological Science Department at Middle East Technical University, we had an opportunity to test our design with co-culture on cancer cells. Our challenge was then to develop a method to detect cancer, form a micro-environment and inhibit cancer formation.
Why Butyrate?
At the beginning of our project, we recorded a few proteins fitting our goal like TSP1, VASH1 ,A4.6.1 , 17-1A and vitamin D.
When we inquired about those proteins we saw that their arrangements are too long to be expressed in E. coli. Since they are eukaryotic (have introns, needs a further protein modification that cannot be performed in a prokaryotic cell and also we can’t be sure if they are folded accurately or not) and  not found naturally in colon, we then started to search an organic compound found naturally in colon and prokaryotically synthesized by the help of bacteria. The best candidate was the butyric acid.
Butyrate is a short chain fatty acid which is formed by bacterial fermentation of carbohydrates (Sengupta et al., 2005). We found out that butyrate prevents colon cancer by promoting differentiation, cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis of transformed colonocyte (Hassig et al., 1997). Since butyrate is already present in the colon it differs from other cancer therapies by not having side - effects (when the concentration is accurately arranged). There are many pathways to produce butyrate. Unlike Toulouse 2015 iGEM Team, we didn’t want to use so many enzymes, because it would create product inefficiency and a crowd in bacteria. We decided to work with a shorter pathway. As Acetyl CoA is readily present in the cytosol and it can be directly converted into our agent, Butyrate, the best choice for us. This enzyme is called ButCoAT (butyryl coA:"

Project design
C. difficile & phage characterisation
C. difficile strain SBRC 078 was isolated previously in the SBRC from clinical faecal samples and belongs to the hypervirulent PCR ribotype 078. The strain contains the genes tcdA and tcdB encoding for both toxins. Phage phiSBRC was previously isolated in the SBRC from an environmental sample and can infect and form plaques on C. difficile SBRC 078. A lysogenic version of C. difficile SBRC 078, which contains phage phiSBRC integrated into the bacterial chromosome, was created previously in the SBRC.
C. difficile growth analysis
The growth profile of the wildtype version of C. difficile SBRC 078 was compared to the growth profile of the lysogenic version of this strain. To assess this the growth of both strains was monitored for 24 hours and the OD at 600 nm was measured and the maximum growth rate was calculated using the equation
(2.303x(log10t2)–(log10t1))/3
where t1 is the OD at the start of exponential phase and t2 is the OD at the end of exponential phase. This data was used to inform the model parameters and was required to ensure that in the human gut the lysogenic bacterial strains created in this project would grow in the same manner as the wild-type cells and therefore would outcompete them.
Phage burst size
Phage burst size was assessed to determine the number of infectious phage particles produced per bacterial cell during one infection cycle. This was determined by measuring the number of infectious phage particles (in plaque forming units per ml) produced over a time-course after infection of C. difficile SBRC 078 with phiSBRC. The titre of free phage at each time point was determined by enumeration of plaques using a plaque assay. C. difficile SBRC 078 was infected to a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1. The burst size was calculated as the Final Phage Titre/(Infection Phage Titre – Titre of Unbound Phages). This data was used to inform the model parameters.

Overlap PCR
Purpose: fuse two or more fragments of DNA using PCR (less efficient)
PCR amplify the fragments
Design PCR primers with 20 base pairs of homology
Run product on a gel to confirm that you have the correct products
Clean up the product
Use the PCR products as template in a PCR reaction where the overlap regions will anneal on their own
Do not use any primers in this step
Run 15 cycles
PCR amplify the fused fragments with the end primers that encapsulate both fragments
 
Colony PCR
Purpose: Determine if cells took up construct after transformation
Take “x” number of colonies from a plate of bacteria and suspend them separately in 100 µL of dH2O
Design primers that amplify a region contained in the target construct (surrounding homology region ideally)
Regions of 200 – 500 bp are ideal
Create a mastermix of forward primers, reverse primers, APEX mastermix, and dH2O (look at table 3 below)
The mastermix should be made for “x” number of reactions without the colony suspension added
Add 1 µL of the colony suspension to 24 µL of the mastermix in a PCR tube and run the samples in a thermocycler
Run the PCR products on a gel to determine if you have the correct construct

IoT (internet of Things) technology currently shows multiple application in aquaculture management.
Li is majorly concerned about the biosafety of our design and we also think it is a key point on whether our product can be sold on the market or not. Let’s pay more attention on safety of our device!
Contact with fish farmers
To make our project and device have practical meaning, we contacted with different fish farmers and presented our project and device to them. Thanks to their feedback, we had better understanding about what fish farmers actually concerned about. In addition, we also found that most of the farmers are lack of basic scientific knowledge to deal with outbreak of fish diseased and ammonia nitrogen. This inspired us to put some effort on publicizing scientific knowledge among fish farmers.
Crab Farmers
Yancheng, Jiangsu Provice, China
Crab is one of the fresh water creatures that are extremely sensitive to water quality and to be specific, ammonia concentration. Therefore, we interviewed some crabs farmers to see what they think about our project.
Key point
Individual farmers lack of cultivation knowledge, so factory farming is not implemented on a large scale.
Experience still plays an important role in assessing pond water quality.
As for the pond water detection, online equipment is expensive while offline kits are complex and abstruse.
According to our communication with the crab farmers, we feet it important to design a product that farmers without much knowledge can use easily. Let’s make a convenient, cheap online device to help the farmers!
Sturgeon Farmers
Beijing, China
Since it is important to and learn about their opinions about ammonia pollution in ponds, we contacted with several farmers in Beijing, paid visits to their ponds and had face-to-face talks with farmers to get more information.
Key point
Fish farmers themselves do not care about biosafety, they only care about how customers think about their aquatic product.
Changing water is an efficient but expensive way to improve the water quality, only big companies can afford 200 thousand yuan per month on changing water.
Our project should aim at self-employed fish ponds instead of those big aquaculture companies.
Good water quality does make fish more tasty and fish can be sold for a higher price as long as the fish tastes good.

“I am implanting some parts into your bodies and I am going to tell you how to operate them later.” Summer was always in such a brief every time she faced something serious. It was her style.
With her words coming to an end, the two guys lay down right away relaxing until she finished the work to install all the parts. In addition, she cloned the connection mediums of those parts then put them into the bacteria. As a result, two bacteria groups were formed. One was led by Lily，after the first part of job accomplished, their heads were painted a red mark. And the other was led by Wind, with a green mark on their heads, their jobs were to finish the work left behind. Well, all things had been worked out. But why the little prince had yet not brought the picnic lunch yet?
“Little Dot, Mr Careless, little prince……”
“I am coming!”
“Aha, nice, I am really hungry!”
After a quick meal, Summer said:“Wind and Lily went out to work. There are something left behind I need to deal with. So I go inside in advance.”
“I would like to enter your laboratory, could I?”
“I will go too.” Mr Careless was not quiet anymore.
“Hey, Mr Careless, do you still remember the bottle of perfume you knocked over last time? It took me over one month to blend!”
“Well, I did not mean it.” Mr Careless said in a timid manner.
“All right.” All of them were happy. One was because he had never been to a laboratory and held the view that there must be lots of novel things. The other two recognized completely that lots of things in Summer’s lab were funny. For example, the pen which can write invisible characters. The characters can only be recognized after met specific kind of liquid.
Summer devoted herself to research after she entered the lab and gave little attention to things around. Now she was busy with detection and decomposition of micromolecules and not clear what to do. When she was observing the cells under the microscope, Mr Careless ran to the mirror below for the purpose of scaring her. However, there was a damn cell ahead and it occupied a definitely excellent position.

Achievement
We uses this system to measure totally 21 pairs of different combination of pInv-gens and pInv-reps. There are 6 different invertases we have tested using the Real-time system. While Cre and Flp are most commonly used recombinases in Biobrick plates, we newly contributed 4 brand-new invertases: Dre, Vcre, Scre, and Vika, all of which are Cre-family recombinases with different and non-intervolving RTS. We successfully proved that all these invertase work pretty good in our system, which you can see in RESULTS . All of the data we gather are analyzed by modeling group to render its corresponding time length. This work could guide other groups for their final design. 
Abstract
Additionally, we prepared a website plug-in to for potential users to design their own timer with specific length of counting time, a project in cooperation with SYSU-software(此处超链接指向软件队主页). According to the data gathered in this research and other promoter intensity given by iGEM official page, we can anticipate the overall timing length of any given combination of various invertase module. Vice versus, if a user could provide his/her target time, we can automatically generate one or more optimized design of Micro-time to precisely match the demand.

A New Era of Biosensors
Biosensors...
...have applications in many aspects of life; from agriculture (testing for pesticides/herbicides) to medicine (diagnostic tests), and everything in between. Unfortunately, biosensor development can be far from simple. Below are some of the major issues identified during this project.
""Quote Quote Quote Quote Quote Quote Quote Quote Quote Quote"" - Firstname Lastname
Our research showed that the overwhelming majority of biosensors fit into a specific design pattern: a 'detector' module, which interacts with the target of choice; a 'processing' module, which does something to a signal (e.g. amplification); and a 'reporter' module, which converts the genetic signal into something which can be perceived by the user or a machine (e.g. a colourmetric output or a change in pH). By making biosensor designs modular in this way, the development of future biosensors can directly benefit from previous designs. This is possible because the processing and reporter modules of a previous design could be connected to a new detector module, hence creating a new biosensor without re-designing new genetic circuit components.
The Sensynova Framework takes this concept further by drawing on the wealth of literature regarding the advantages of multicellular communities in synthetic biology. Each module described above is separated into separate cells, which can be co-cultured to form a functioning biosensor. This allows for truly 'plug-and-play' behaviour, in which a newly designed detector module within a cell can be simply added to previously designed and characterised processing and reporter module cells without requiring any DNA assembly or re-design"

Since the beginning of the human race, we have tried to communicate our feelings,                         thoughts, and achievements. That’s why having good skills in public engagement are needed then                         and now. Therefore, in the path of developing TecTissue, we have several activities in order to                         express the main objectives of our project, the need to solve the problem of burns and also                         encourage people in the field of science.
GOLD
Rino-Q.
On July, 5th, and 6th, we had the opportunity to visit Rino-Q, which stands for                         “Integral Rescue                         of the Burnt                         Child” in Spanish. It is a foundation in charge of the overall rehabilitation of kids                         and                         adults who have                         suffered burns. We had to book a hotel since we come from the State of Mexico and                         traveled to                         San Luis Potosi.                         We arrived and got a brief tour of the facilities. After that, we had a meaningful                         conversation                         with the                         director of the foundation, Gerardo Manuel García Lozano and his wife, Beatriz Eugenia                         Hernández Contreras.                         They explained to us the complications of treating with burned people as well as the                         costs it                         implied. One of                         the most important aspects to consider when addressing the problem is the amount of                         time                         patients remain hospitalized due to their burns. This represents one of the main opportunities for our                         project.                         The next day we taught a group of kids who were part of the foundation about synthetic                         biology                         and prepared                         some activities to reinforce what they learned through games and interactive dynamics.                         In the                         end, we                         approached the parents and families of the kids so that they could talk about their                         experiences                         and                         testimonies. After the visit, we realized that, in addition to the statistics and                         technical                         information                         regarding burned people and their treatment, we have a moral commitment with the kids                         and                         society in general                         because we have the possibility and therefore the duty to help"

Outreach
Our team made an effort to spread the idea of synthetic biology to the community in a somewhat traditional manner as well. We conducted talks and workshop for undergraduate students. In addition to that, we also held similar activities to reach out to high school students, who will be entering university in a near future.
Talks
Presentations are one of the most common and effective ways to share information and convey messages. This year, HKUST iGEM Team held two sessions of presentations for the freshmen. One session was conducted on the 26th of September for freshmen from School of Science, and another one was conducted on 13th of October for freshmen from School of Engineering. Through the presentations, we introduced synthetic biology and iGEM, explained briefly about our main project, shared our experiences joining the iGEM competition and encouraged the freshmen to join iGEM in the future. It was good to see students with different intended majors equally participate in the talk, and moreover show their enthusiastic attitude on synthetic biology and iGEM competition.

Workshop
Fig 2. Workshop for college undergraduate science students
To help HKUST students become more familiar with iGEM research activity, we felt that a hands-on laboratory experience would be a very interactive method for them to have a better understanding of synthetic biology. It would be an effective way to get those students introduced to the practical aspect of iGEM research.  Therefore, our team organized a workshop on the 7th of October for a group of 15 interested freshmen. This three-hour workshop was divided into two sessions - talk and wet lab. For the talk, our team first explained about the basics of synthetic biology and iGEM, as well as the rough idea of building constructs. We also introduced them to some common experiments in a synthetic biology laboratory. For the wet lab session, the participants were divided into smaller"

Fig 14. Acceptance of melatonin of the people with                                             night shifts
      Not so surprisingly, over two third of the                                         people we investigated showed no                                         acknowledgement of melatonin, while 24% of the people have heard of melatonin                                         but not sure about its usage and only 8% know its curative effect. When asked                                         whether they will try melatonin, 50% of the people who go for night shifts state                                         that they don’t need medicine and 39% of them keep cautious and want to learn                                         more; distrust is also seen where 3% of the respondents regard melatonin is not                                         reliable. Only 8% percent of the night shift groups say that they would try                                         melatonin. Obviously, more toil must be committed to educate the people about                                         melatonin.
1.3 Conclusion & Discussion
      To determine more precisely the current                                         sleeping conditions and to evaluate more                                         objectively about the knowledge on melatonin of both the groups having normal                                         schedules and having night shifts, we conducted two questionnaire survey targeting the two groups, respectively, and we get a deeper understanding of our                                         questions.
      Considering the people’s sleeping quality,                                         the data apparently show that most                                         people do not meet the healthy sleep time standard (≥ 8 hours). Besides the                                         common sleep problems like going to bed too late or not having enough time to                                         sleep, people suffer from other problems that affect their sleep quality like                                         feeling difficult to fall asleep or easy to be waken up. The population in China                                         is large, so the absolute number of people who have trouble with sleeping is                                         enormous which makes this no trivial issue. As stated above in the Results                                         section, many dominating sleeping problems result from the disrupted circadian                                         clock, whose symptoms could be eased by taking exogenous melatonin.
      As for the awareness of sleeping, we regard                                         most of our respondents lack                                         sufficient knowledge, which is reflected by their ways of regulating sleep and                                         improving sleep quality – the methods are indeed traditional, but they have no                                         apparent effect and easily falls into the range of placebo. To sleep better,                                         know more about sleep first; science popularizing sessions and activities can                                         serve as very good ways to arouse public attention and improve public awareness.
      For the people who goes for night shifts,                                         such as servicemen, flight attendance                                         and medical staffs"
UPO-Sevilla,2011,Team:UPO-Sevilla#Project#Improving Flip Flop#Results#Change Speed_-_-_TEXT.html," IPTG state induction time and swith change using flourometry and flux cytometry. Unfortunately we haven’t been able to analyse all of them yet. Though, we have observed that the “IPTG state” tends to impose itself over the 42ºC state in the absence of induction. We expect to show these results in the World Championship Jamboree.
Note: For an easier understanding of the bistable system we denominate ""IPTG state"" to the transcriptional state caused by IPTG induction; and ""42ºC state"" to the transcriptional state caused by 42ºC heat shock induction. In the improved flip-flop the 42ºC state causes GFP expression and the IPTG state causes RFP expression. The Basic Flip-Flop works in the opposite way: the 42ºC state causes RFP expression and the IPTG state causes GFP expression. The 42ºC/IPTG denomination will be very useful for the comparison of basic and improved flip-flops.

Abstract
Navigation Instructions
Sponsors
Cystic Fibrosis is a genetic disease that results in the accumulation of thick mucus in the epithelial linings of the entire body, particularly the respiratory tract. Over the course of a patient’s life, the mucus-lined lung epithelium becomes repeatedly infected with pathogenic bacteria that stimulate an immune response; leading to inflammation, tissue damage, and ultimately, respiratory failure.
The microflora of the Cystic Fibrosis lung changes over time. In childhood, the major coloniser is Staphylococcus aureus, but as the patient matures other bacterial pathogens infect. The later-dominating pathogens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Burkholderia cepacia, are very difficult to eradicate and are associated with chronic decline in lung function. Burkholderia is so infectious that patients have to be isolated from one another, and can be denied lung transplants due to the persistence of this bacterium.
It is important, therefore, for medics to monitor and identify the levels of bacteria within the respiratory tract of a Cystic Fibrosis patient. Currently, patients must provide sputum samples and identification of bacteria takes between 72 hours and 2 weeks, by which point the bacteria can be in an antibiotic resistant state.
The Dundee 2014 iGEM project is focused on designing and testing a device that will rapidly and non-invasively identify the bacteria colonising a Cystic Fibrosis patient. Three biosensors will be developed that recognise external signal molecules produced by key bacteria, all of which are known to be in sputum samples of Cystic Fibrosis patients. A quinolone signal (PQS) is produced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a Diffusible Signal Factor (DSF) is produced by Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, an organism that is also associated with Cystic Fibrosis lung infection in adults, and BDSF is a related, but chemically distinct molecule that is produced by Burkholderia cepacia.
By engineering signal recognition and signal transduction proteins from these biological systems the Dundee iGEM team want to produce a portable electronic device that will identify infection outside of the"
PASantiago_Chile,2017,Team:PASantiago Chile#project_-_-_TEXT.html," The virus synthesizes (object) from the Cl repressor, which inhibits the expression of the rest of the genes, where in conditions of cellular stress the bacterium activates the SOS response, acting RecA to inhibit the activity of the Cl repressor that ends a chain reaction that causes the virus is integrated into lithic route. It is here where the cell is usually infected, producing viral particles that are released into the medium, once the host bacterium is lysed the cell membrane breaks, killing it in the process.
With the activation of RecA and the transcription of the Cro, LuxR and LuxI genes, the activation of the second plasmid with the LuxR / HSL promoter will be given, which will allow the color to be transcribed in the same way as the purple color, and the lemon-smelling gene. This will be the warning signal for our specialist. (Plasmid 2)
The operation of the circuit was taken from the work already done by a group of IGEM 2011, Penn States, which, similarly detect the harmful radiation rates, but unlike ours, RecA detects damage, prevents repair and connects to a reporter to know where the damaged DNA is. (States, 2011)
Why does the RecA protein serve us?
RecA is a multifunctional protein, which is essential for different biological processes. Coordinated regulation of unrelated gene expression in response to damaged DNA, also known as SOS response, is what matters for this project.
The regulatory role of RecA works with an SOS operon of approximately 20 unrelated genes inducible by overexposure to DNA damaging agents. The encoded enzymes that induce these genes work to cut out the damaged DNA and facilitate the repair of possible damage occurring in DNA recombination.
Expression of the SOS genes is controlled by the LexA repressor that represses its response, binds to the group of inducible SOS genes and limits its transcription. After the event with high levels of radiation has occurred, the co-protease activity of RecA is activated, due to the generation of a single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), either by the action of the nucleases or because the replication fork is stagnant.
This single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) binds to RecA in the presence of ATP, promoting the formation of a nucleoprotein that separates the repressor LexA and induces the SOS genes, including RecA. Genes that weakly bind to LexA are the first to be fully expressed. If the damage persists or is very high, the concentration of the RecA protein increases and other"

Calgary,2014,Team:Calgary#Sandbox#Project#Collaboration_-_-_TEXT.html," Facebook page to learn about peoples opinions regarding different aspects of synthetic biology. They asked iGEM teams from all around the world to participate!
We (iGEM Calgary) helped out by asking Calgarians their favorite application of synthetic biology, containment concerns and how they feel about ethical issues surrounding genetically engineered organisms. A few of the responses we got are posted below. To view more pictures please visit the “ Humans and Synbio” Facebook page!
Do you think there is a limit in how far we should go with syn bio?
""Synthetic biology is an area of research which has unlimited potential for growth and innovation. I believe that synthetic biology has the capacity to be hugely advantageous to the scientific community and to society as a whole. It would be irresponsible to ignore the potentially harmful applications of synthetic biology, however, the potential benefits provided by research in this area exceed the disadvantages. Through establishing firm regulations in this area I believe that research can be conducted in a safe and productive manner. I believe it is the responsibility of members of society, including those in the scientific community, to establish the ethical groundwork which will shape the aims and applications of synthetic biology.""
In general, how do you feel about humans purposely modifying organisms or species so they will be more useful to us?
""If humans can benefit from modifying organisms or species they should, as long as it is done in a humane sustainable way.""
How would you define humane use of animals?
“By humane I mean in a way that doesn't cause unnecessary suffering or excruciating pain to the animals because life is precious and shouldn't be mistreated if we can help it.”
What is you favorite application of synthetic biology?
“I know it's an old school example, but my favorite application of syn bio would have to be when they got E. coli to make human insulin. That definitely revolutionized how we look at type 1 diabetes and really improved people's lives.”
Synthetic biology creates biological systems that do not naturally exist. Does anything about synthetic biology make you feel uncomfortable?
“The idea of synthetic biology doesn’t make me feel uncomfortable but the applications and potential outcomes are somewhat worrisome. I don’t know much about the topic on hand but just as long as there are regulations in place and governing bodies to overlook the research and applications, I would feel at ease with it all.”
How do you feel about humans purposely modifying organisms or species so that they will be more useful to us?
""I’m sure that there are benefits that do go along with that type of research, but I am a firm believer in the earth is where it is for a reason and we are where we are for"

Figure 2 : Corn Syrup chromatography analysis
Figure 3 : in-lab produced maltodextrin chromatography analysis
Figure 4 : Industrial hexamaltaose  chromatography analysis
First, we can see that the industrial maltopentaose is closer to hexamaltose than maltopentaose. The homemade one is particularly rich in tetramaltose. By comparing homemade maltopentaose to corn syrup, we can assert that the purification we conducted is an enrichment in tetramaltose. We can also see that there are still some DP 2 and 3 in our homemade product. This could be a problem regarding our selection goal, but we observed that petri dishes with maltopentaose (both kinds) never showed growth of our negative control with the wt pIV. We concluded that these DP 2 and 3 were not in high enough concentrations to allow growth of false positives on our selection media. Traces of DP 2 and 3 might even have helped our bacteria to implant on their medium before facing restrictive media with low resources concentrations. Considering these results, we judged this step of maltopentaose production by ourselves as a success.

After promoting the iGEM competition to the Victorian State Chair of National Science Week (NSW) - Nick Besley, our team decided to field a stall in ‘Market of the Mind’ – a NSW event aimed at the general public located in a high foot traffic area alongside the Yarra River in Southbank across the river from Flinders St Station. Luckily, our stall was located next to the bar, which meant there was a lot of foot traffic directed to our happy team members wearing our iGEM team t-shirts. Using a true/false quiz, armed with Ferrero Rochers as rewards for getting all the answers correct, we had over 30 quiz contestants engage with us on the first night and 35+ contestants on the second day.

Intellectual Property
Our team considered the question of ‘how should we proceed if we want to retain IP rights on our project’?
Before attempting to answer this pertinent IP question, our team leader decided to recruit two more team members who had some intellectual property experience to complement the learning on patent law that a few early team members had acquired in their biotechnology undergraduate degrees. Both the new team members had previously filed provisional patents; one had filed some in Russia and the other in Australia, offering two perspectives on this question of IP.
In answering this question, we approached our universities’ tech transfer office to gain clarity over our team’s discussions and brainstorm sessions on whether our project was patentable.
The tech transfer office advised us that our project may have commercial applications, however it was probably too soon to act on the idea and convert it into a provisional patent, so we decided to hold off and wait till we had a more substantiated grasp on our commercial applications. We were also advised that if at any point we wanted to file for IP protection on the project, it would be really important to not have disclosed the details of our idea to anyone else, as this could result in us losing the right to our IP.
After doing some research on the various law firms who could offer us a provisional patent, we discovered the estimated cost would be in the vicinity of $3500-$6500 depending on the level of detail we wanted to cover"

Bielefeld-Germany,2013,Team:Bielefeld-Germany#Project#MFC_-_-_TEXT.html," concentrations. Since all mediators tested lose their color when reduced, a change in the color of the solution indicates that the bacteria are able to reduce the respective compound. Incubation took place at 24°C for 24 hours.
Figure 31: Reaction tubes with bacteria and different concentrations of methylene blue and neutral red after 24 hours of incubation.
In Figure 31 it can be seen that the samples containing methylene blue show a reduction of color intensity after incubation. Oxygen is able to reoxidize leucomethylene blue to the molecules blue form, so a blue color near the liquids surface is to be expected. Based on these results, methylene blue was chosen as the preferred exogenous mediator for further experiments.
Figure 32: Lewis structures of the cationic form of methylene blue (right side) and the reduced form, called leucomethylene blue (left side).
When methylene blue salts are dissolved in water, they dissociate into anions and methylene blue cations (see Figure 32). The conjugated electron systems of the molecule causes methylene blue solutions to appear in a dark blue color.
The compound can be reduced, accepting an electron and a proton in the process (see Figure 32). This interrupts the conjugated electron system, which is why leucomethylene blue is colorless. The standard potential of the methylene blue/ leucomethylene blue reaction is +0.01 V.
Results
One possibility for the analysis and characterization of microbial fuel cells are polarization and power curves. By using different microorganisms, while keeping all other conditions the same, this measurement method allows a direct comparison of the electrical power provided.
To record a polarization curve for the whole fuel cell, the electrical circuit described in Figure 3 was used with a variable resistor box and a second multimeter for current measurement. The self-constructed box, shown in Figure 4, contains six different potentiometers which are each connected with a switch for easy and fast shifting between the different resistance values. Beginning with the lowest one, a periodic increase of the resistance from 10 Ω to 10 kΩ is performed. Like presented in Figure 33, the system expectedly reacts with an increase of voltage and, after a few minutes, reaches a constant value, which is used for further investigations. When looking at the recorded voltage values in Figure 33 it is obvious that a mediator, in this case methylene blue, in combination with the biocatalyst E. coli is essential for electron transport. In contrast to the voltage values reached with this setup even"

CLSB-UK,2017,Team:CLSB-UK#Software#Alexa_-_-_TEXT.html,"’s very easy to use the software in existing workflows; if your protocols aren’t already on Protocat they simply need to be uploaded and they’d instantaneously be available on our app.
We looked into protocols.io’s API , another protocol database, and contacted the team there to try and get access to the public protocols without the user’s login details. Their cofounder, Alexei Stoliartchouk, informed us that they are working on adding that ability but at the time of writing it had not yet been implemented.
We also looked into sourcing protocols from OpenWetWare . Despite having an immensely useful database the protocols are not in any standard format and thus very difficult to parse automatically. We talked with Michigan Software , who are looking into standardising a protocol format as part of their human practices work.
Testing and feedback
Several teams tested it at the UK meetup, including Judd-UK. Judd suggested the team lookup feature and the ability to repeat a step in the protocol (as opposed to just next and back), both of which we implemented soon after.
Judd also suggested having a command to skip to a particular step. We tried to implement this but found it wasn’t feasible as it caused conflicts with the part lookup feature. This was because the natural language processing algorithms tended to match the numbers to part IDs.
Future work
As it’s open-source (GPLv3 license) and available on Github , other teams are free to build other functions or improve the current ones. In the future all kinds of biological queries could be supported such as looking up particular reagents or safety instructions. It also has the potential to control future IoT lab equipment, such as WiFi-enabled centrifuges or electrophoresis power supplies.

Scientific Background
Sporobeads are Bacillus subtilis spores modified in a way that they can be used as a platform for individual protein display. The aim of this module is to create these spores that display fusion proteins on their surface. There are several different proteins forming the spore coat layers of B. subtilis spores (Fig. 1). The outermost layer, the so-called spore crust, is composed of two proteins, CotZ and CgeA ( Imamura et al., 2011 ). This is why we used them to create functional fusion proteins to be expressed on our Sporobeads.
Fig. 1: Composition of the Bacillus subtilis spore coat ( McKenney et al., 2010 & Imamura et al., 2011 )
Crust Protein Genes Organization
The gene cgeA is located in the cgeABCDE cluster and is expressed from its own promoter PcgeA. The cluster cotVWXYZ contains the gene cotZ which is cotranscribed with cotY and expressed from the promoter PcotYZ. Another promoter of this cluster, PcotV, is responsible for the transcription of the other three genes (Fig. 2). Those three promoters were evaluated with the lux reporter genes ( pSBBs3C-luxABCDE ) to analyze their strength and the time point of their activation (see data ). Based on this data, two of the three promoters could be used for expression of spore crust fusion proteins.

Our Project
For this year’s iGEM competition our team has set out to find a method for producing new regulatory parts used in the construction of complex biological devices.
Transcription is the first step of gene expression that can be regulated. Key elements of this regulation are proteins recognising and binding specific DNA sequences that either recruit the full  transcription machinery or prevent it from assembling on the DNA. It is this class of proteins, called transcription factors (TFs), that we intend to engineer.
Existing DNA binding proteins can be a starting point for developing these new TFs. By changing its residues it is possible to modify the affinity of these proteins to a specific binding site  and interact with the activation or repression mechanisms of the downstream gene transcription. Investigating these effects can improve our understanding of how the residue composition affects the TF's ability to recognise a given DNA consensus sequence.
Engineering new transcription factors will not only give us a better idea of how they work but also extend the tool kit of the synthetic biologist. Within synthetic biology, TFs are used to design biological circuits where they act as building blocks for reporters, inverters, logic functions and switches . Extending the tool kit with new TFs will allow combinations of the devices that today share the same regulatory elements and thus cannot be used in the same system.
Our project’s outcome will be a method to derive pairs of TFs and DNA binding sites meeting selection criteria for orthogonality, affinity and specificity. It will include setting a selection scheme that allows for high throughput testing identification of functional TF-consensus sequence pairs in vitro and in vivo. We plan to use bacterial culture in parallel chemostat platforms and MITOMI  to screen a library of TFs against a set of consensus sequences.
Our research will begin with the tetracycline repressor (TetR), a transcription factor which down-regulates (represses) the transcription of the adjacent gene. This protein and its mutants are often used by synthetic biologists “as control elements to"

The DmpR we use is based on the wild type DmpR used by 2013 Peking ( BBa_K1031211 ) but has 5 sites of nucleotides mutation[7] of which two are nonsense mutation and others lead to two amino acids change. The mutant type shows high efficiency of transcription initiation .

TfdB-JLU is a novel 2,4-dichlorophenol hydroxylase whose amino acid sequence exhibits less than 48% homology with other known TfdBs. The rate-limited step of phenolic degradation is the ortho hydroxylation[8]. Compared to wild-type TfdB, TfdB-JLU has a wilder substrate range and higher catalysis activity. Thus, the enzyme has advantages in efficient disposing of phenolic effluents[8].

SPONSORSHIP
The marketing team has immediately delved into researching and contacting pharmaceutical and biotech companies and research organizations from early May. But to begin marketing, we needed some sort of a document to describe the purpose and goal of our marketing initiatives. Therefore, the marketing team devised a Sponsorship package. This package introduces the iGEM competition, our project, past successes of the team, areas of sponsorship and a breakdown of the different levels of sponsorship. Starting from Community sponsors, the level of contribution from each organization is recognized under the bronze, silver, gold and platinum banners. The iGEM team will give back to corporates in the form of advertisements at the local, national and international levels based on the level of sponsorship provided to the team.
The marketing team has contacted companies such as SNC Lavalin, Nexen and Roche Canada and labs such as Cedarlane Labs and New England Biolabs, only to name a few. Our sponsors were thrilled to hear about this year’s project which could potentially be geared towards the advancement of medicine or assisting industries. This sponsorship package gave them the background information needed to answer their basic questions.
Most companies have responded promptly and informed us that they were unable to sponsor our project this summer. Our sponsorship proposals have been sent to not only the Corporate staff but many Executive committee members. Companies who were unable to support the iGEM team this year will"

Plac promoter characterization
Back to Reporter systems || Ptet | Plac | Plasmid details
We used a medium-strength Plac promoter that had been designed by Henrike Niederholtmeyer and put it into biobrick format. We characterized it by coupling the promoter to RFP and adding increasing concentrations of IPTG.
We didn't transform a LacI gene in the DH5alpha cells. Still, these cells can have a basal expression of the transcription factor. By adding IPTG to the cell's medium, we make sure to inhibit any endogenous LacI expression, in order to have the maximal RFP expression that can be driven by our Plac biobrick. The plasmid used for this characterization was J61002 Plac-RFP .
IPTG induction
The DH5alphas cells, even if the plasmid we transform doesn't contain TetR, can still have a basal expression of the transcription factor. By adding ATC, we are able to inhibit this TetR basal expression, revealing the full power of Ptet as a promoter sequence.
Cells without IPTG:
Cells with IPTG:
Experimental results:
The cells treated with IPTG produced more RFP than their non-treated counterparts; this difference is not striking, showing that the basal expression of LacI by our DH5alpha cells is quite low. The normal expression of RFP driven by our Plac promoter is of 530 normalized RFUs; the highest value is 640 normalized RFUs.
Dose-response curve
This graph shows the action of IPTG on RFU output. Since it doesn't seem to saturate, there was perhaps still some repression by LacI occurring in our cells. Interestingly, LacI does have a quantifiable action on our Ptet promoter - meaning that we can use it efficiently in our second reporter system .

Carnegie_Mellon,2015,Team:Carnegie Mellon#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html,"L of culture and 100uL of extracted protein for each culture transformed to express fluorescent proteins
Week 6
6.29.15
Goal: Start work with the Gaussia Luciferase and continue work with fluorescent proteins in TOP10 cells.
Started five 2 mL cultures of the Luciferase for experiments tomorrow.
Restreaked fluorescent proteins that were transformed last week into TOP10 cells.
Start 5 mL cultures of the fluorescent proteins for purification tomorrow. Started these from the plates that were grown on 6/19.
`
6.30.15
Goal: Run the TECAN and the BCA protein assay test on the proteins we purified last week
Conduct standard BSA protein assay protocol. Use same standards as last week & same dilutions of culture for sample readings (1:10, 1:100)
Run TECAN to try & find correlation between concentration of protein in culture with fluorescence data.
Made new BSA standards for use in BCA protein assay experiments. Made four standards; 3 μg/mL, 9 μg/mL, 15 μg/mL, and 20 μg/mL.
For 3 µg/mL of BSA, the absorbance @ 595 nm was 0.047; for 9 µg/mL, 0.707 absorbance; 15 µg/mL had 0.665; 20 µg/mL had 0.792.
7.01.15
Goal: Test the Arduino-based luminometer with the Luciferase cultures we started yesterday.
Used TECAN plate and a tube to test Light Dependent Resistor and make sure it is sensitive enough to make the measurements we need.
Added 100 μL cells to a TECAN well. Kept lights off and the Arduino recording data until it read no signal. Added coelenterazine into cells and observed what happens. Expected cells to emit light.
Did not have much luck with these tests (the LDR could not pick up such a faint signal)
Tried to purify luciferase to get a better response.
There was likely no response because of the cheap diode used.
Started an overnight from the No IPTG cultures. Added 500 mL of the No IPTG culture to 5 mL LB, 5 μL chloramphenicol and 5 μL IPTG.
Started overnights from the Luciferase cultures; three 2 mL & two 1 mL. Added 1% chloramphenicol and 10% culture to the media.
Will begin using the Arduino Mega instead of the Arduino Uno in order to"

When the glass substrates were removed the beaker, a golden-red color was observed, leading to the conclusion that gold was bound to the cysteine subunits of the curli. Unfortunately, optical microscopy did not show whether nanoparticles were bound, so this outcome still needs to be verified using electron microscopy.
Better results have been obtained upon binding cadmium salts. For this setup, a solution of Cd(NO3)2 with c = 50 mmol has been spread on a biofilm grown on an FTO substrate. After a few minutes of incubation, nanoparticles have been formed by addition of a Na2S solution with c = 150 mmol. By doing this, the difficultly soluble compound CdS precipitates in the form of nanoparticles, which can also be observed by an immediate color change from transparent to bright yellow-orange. After the reaction, all residual liquid was removed. The remaining color on the biofilm seen in Figure 1 implies  that cadmium was bound by the biofilm.
Figure 2: CdS nanoparticles on a biofilm grown on an FTO substrate. The bright yellow color indicates that CdS is present.
ZnO Mineralization
Figure 1: TEM images of ZnO microflowers related to syntheses by Zhang et al. (2004).
From the TEM images of the ZnO synthesis it could be concluded that no autoclave is needed to produce the microflowers, which was used by Zhang et al. (2004). The purpose using highly branched systems, is an increase of adsorbing molecules on the surface. Further, the branched ZnO clusters can be anchored more simply in a biofilm, than flat or spherical nanoplatelets. The size of the microflowers was a general problem for our proof of concept. As the particles could cover most of the distance from one electrode to the other. This implies that biofilm can be used as template to stabilize the structures, however it is no crucial factor. To circumvent this issue, we changed the procedure to a direct mineralization process, where the biofilm is directly involved in the synthesis on ZnO.
Figure 2: ZnO nanoparticles grown in presence (left) and absence of curli fibers (right) on a p-doped silica wafer
The REM images (Figure 1) visualize the difference between ZnO growth in presence and absence of curli fibers on the glass surface. In presence of curli, the particles tend to grow isotropically, with fibers coated around an assembly of individual particles."

Interview and group discussion with Dr. Mirko Himmel
Projects dealing with genetically modified organisms (GMO) offer a great chance to recreate living organisms in a novel way, opening new possibilities to address problems. However, taking advantage of these new opportunities comes with responsibility for the GMOs as well as for the environment. The big keywords here are biosafety and -security. While developing the S.H.I.E.L.D as a malaria prevention method this year, we used bacteria which were modified to sustain itself for a potentially indefinite amount of time while producing a neurotoxin. Regarding these two aspects of our project, biosafety was of great concern to us. To discuss the risk factors of our project with an expert, we invited Dr. Mirko Himmel from the Carl Friedrich von Weizäcker-Centre for Science and Peace Research. He holds a degree in biochemistry, with a specialisation in biological arms control and biosecurity matters today. He gave us a detailed introduction into biosafety and security focusing on the difficulty of Dual Use Research of Concern (DURC). This informative lecture was followed by an open discussion addressing potential issues in safety and security as well as possible solutions. Lastly, Dr. Himmel raised the topic of important and sensible precautions for lab work.
The first major topic of the discussion was possible off-target organisms of the S.H.I.E.L.D. In the device we developed, the toxin produced by our bacterial culture is separated by a hydrogel from the environment. Due to this specific design, only animals that can sting this gel have access to the toxin and can suck it out. This prevents any other animals from getting in contact with the toxin while the trap is intact. Furthermore, the composition of attractants used in the S.H.I.E.L.D. are specifically designed to lure mosquitoes, reducing the chance other animals might fly into the trap.

Prof. Dr. Wilfried Weber
Wilfried Weber supports us not only with fancy ideas but also with his experimental experience and lab equipment. We were always welcome in his lab group and could always ask for help.
It was very helpful to get his appraisals, if our project ideas were practicable. And no matter what is happening you'll see him smiling... :-)
Prof. Dr. Gerald Radziwill
Gerald Radziwill is our PI. His support concerning any open questions or tasks is essential for our project. He enabled the participation of our team and always has an open ear for problems whether it concerns experimental procedures, cell culture handling or safety.
Supporters
Hannes Beyer
Hannes supported us with very helpful advice concerning experiment planning for controlling our system via light and for spatiotemporal light induction in our uniBOX. He also provided us with cells. That was especially great when we needed to expand our cell culture after the Lyon Jamboree.
Konrad Müller
Without Konrads experience in light experiments we would have had a hard time to get these systems running. With his support spatiotemporal light induction in our uniBOX finally worked.
Desiree Hövermann
Desiree was our expert for the (d)Cas9 ELISA. She helped us to develop and optimize the uniBAss and it was very helpful to discuss our project with her.
Maximilian Hörner
Maximilian supported us in concerns of hormone induced nuclear localization of our Cas9 and helped us in discussions over our project.
Patrick Schindler
Patrick is the quiet giant, who always reminds us to consider certain aspects from a different angle. Due to his deep voice, his advices are even given more importance. Our team benefits from his experience as he also participated in iGEM 2010 . Furthermore, he is known for organizing big board game parties!

The plates were divided into quadrants with CHOP on the top left and bottom left quadrants and crcB on the top right and bottom right.
CHOP had the most growth at 100μM F at 10-4 dilution.
Future Directions
The CHOP System can be used to improve the affinity and characterization of the fluoride riboswitch.
Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) system may be used for detecting presence of fluoride; at a certain level of fluoride, it can trigger gene expression of the GFP as the fluoride riboswitch releases terminator. This may provide a better visual mechanism for people to determine if their water can be safe to drink or not.
A fluorinase gene can be utilized to bio-remediate the excess fluoride in water."

And then we changed our chassis to S. cerevisiae to verify the function of the kill switch we designed, which works like this: heat shock can cause the aggregation of Sup35 while GdnHCl can disaggregate them. We tried to detect the aggregation level of Sup35 under temperature and GdnHCl concentration gradient by measuring the fluorescence the S. cerevisiae produced. As what we’ve already mentioned before, the aggregation condition of Sup35 is indicated by the fluorescence intensity. The low level of fluorescence intensity can indicate high level of aggregation of Sup35, this is because when sup35 aggregates, sfGFP11, which is fused with sup35, will fail to bind with sfGFP1-10. According to the mechanism of split sfGFP system, it can lead to weaker fluorescent intensity. Briefly speaking, the brighter the fluorescence is, the weaker the proteins' aggregation is.
We conducted experiments to compare the different fluorescence intensity induced by heat shock under temperature gradient. And in further experiment, we added GdnHCl solution to the system and then we measured the fluorescence to see if GdnHCl can disaggregate the protein. So that we could know if our kill switch can works effectively.
The expected results are fluorescence intensity will decrease under heat shock. But if we add GdnHCl solution to the system the fluorescence will turn back due to the curing function of GdnHCl.
Experiment Results
1. The spilt sfGFP experiment in E. coli
To test if the split sfGFP can function as our expectation, we transform the plasmids containing sfGFP1-10 and the plasmids containing sfGFP11 respectively in BL21, cultivating the bacteria at 37°C and shacking at 250 rpm/min overnight. We use fluorescence microscope to observe the bacteria under 100X objective lens. From these fluorescent images, we find that fluorescence of sfGFP1-10 is stronger than the fluorescence of sfGFP11 and both of them are weak. It corresponds with our expectation that either of separate part of sfGFP have part function of complete sfGFP and sfGFP1-10, which is longer, may be brighter after excitation.
However, when the pSB1C3 carrying the part of sfGFP11 and the pSB1A3 carrying the part of sfGFP1-10 ware expressed together in E. coli , it doesn't present stronger fluorescence than either plasmid is expressed in E. Coli respectively. the possible reasons are as"

Small cultures, PCR and analysis of new pTetO + HlyB/D
New small cultures were made of pTetO+HlyB/D which were incubated for 5 hours in the morning, and then a colony PCR was run with a control construct that has the HlyB/D. It turned out that colony 3, 4 and 5 had a band at the right height but were quite thin and samples 4 and 5 had an extra band.
Lysostaphin induction
An induction of lysostaphin was done to see if it gets produced. This was done on the transformed cells from Wednesday the 15th of August. Induction was done with arabinose. It was analyzed with an SDS-PAGE in which we could see a clear protein production pattern over time, but it seemed as if lysostaphin-HlyA was cleaved over time since the bands at 50kDa (combined weight) dissappeared and bands at 25 kDa (separate weights) occurred.

Its name is the abbreviation respective of Science, Education, Life and Future.
This time, we invited Ph.D. Haoqian Zhang, who is once an iGEMer and now the chief technology officer of a syn-bio company Bluepha, to give a speech on SELF Conference. Aiming at promoting synthetic biology, the speech talked about its principle, significance and various applications. In this conference which more than two hundred people attended, our UCAS iGEM team members offered volunteer services and have a really good time!
Overview
Aiming at designing an effective, convenient and cheap device to detect ammonia for fish farmers, we believe that our device has the potential to be applied in the real ponds and reach commercial success. The following is a summary of our work on entrepreneurship, including the discussion on product application, market analysis and financial summary.
Product Application
Since a patent is needed if we want to apply our device on real ponds, we went to the department of transformation of scientific and technological achievements in Institute of Biophysics, and asked for advice. During the communication with the staff there, we learned about the process of applying a patent and noted significant issues. At present, we are planning to apply a patent for our designs after the project is finished.
Market Analysis Summary
In China, freshwater aquaculture is the most important production method in the fishery industries. Among all aquaculture modes, ponds account for over 75% of the product. Nevertheless, few farming ponds in China are equipped with ammonia monitoring and water purification systems, causing pollution and fish diseases and reduced aquaculture production.
We compared our designs with other methods on the market which are widely used currently, and find our designs having the obvious advantages such as cheaper, cleaner and more convenient.

Both of the red line and the blue line in the illustration show that the colony coverage decreases while the level of IPTG increases, which suggests that the growth of colony is somehow repressed. Moreover, the yellow line reveals that the IPTG has little side effect on colony. As a result, FtsZ truly represses the growth of bacteria and also provide experimental evidence for our project scheme.
For the efficiency of paired termini structure, we have done some additional experiments. Detailed results can be seen here.

What other methods for recycling P3HB and PLA are there?
Currently we are are not aware of any technologies available for the recycling of P3HB, that makes this this first.
PLA can be recycled by chemical means, reducing it into the monomer and then re-polymerising it again. However, innovation in recycling methods which tackle some of the key issues facing PLA will be key to its successful increased use. One benefit is the ability to recycle material contaminated with food waste. Currently plastics with more than 10% food waste contamination must be incinerated or landfilled. With biological recycling this would become an asset, helping to feed the bacteria.
Solid Recovered Fuel(SRF) contains finite resources which are currently used inefficiently.; Peaks of Waste

2.With SYSU
We met up with the iGEM team SYSU-China in May, introducing each other's projects, teams and experiments, sharing some experience in modeling, and exchanging ideas. We built strong friendship with each other.
In September, in order to solve the problem of simultaneous measurement of the rate of detachment of bacteria and algae, two-wavelength method was established based on Beer-Lambert Law. After obtaining experimental data, we needed to verify the accuracy of the two-wavelength method by modeling and data analysis. Team SYSU-China had given us a lot of help in data analysis, and to some extent proved the reliability of the method.
3.With Team SUIS Alpha
On June 16th, the Shanghai Pinghe High School team came to our school. Since we both contain bacteria and algae symbiosis in project, we gave guidance on the overall framework of design and experiment to them. In the original design, they wanted bacteria to express a small molecule (iron carrier) so that they could better achieve the purpose of manufacturing. We emphasized the importance of pre-experiment for them and suggested that it should be carried out with pure chemical molecules. Moreover, it should be emphasized that the engineered bacteria transformation and expression could be carried out after the pre-experiment success.
4.Communication with Team worldshaper-wuhan
On July 31, 2018, the high school team worldshaper-wuhan came to visit us. In addition to giving them introduction on the project, we took the initiative to help them contact the community and provide them with a platform to showcase project and broadcast synthetic biology.
5.iGEM Central China Regional Conference and with HUST
At the beginning of this summer, team Hust-China held the 5th Central China Regional Conference. Although there were not many experiments results in the presentation, but the design was basically completed. We presented our projects and communicated with each other.  We knew about that the project of team Hust-China this year also involved the symbiosis of bacteria and algae, and they plan to use it to generate electricity. We have discussed experiments on symbiotic co-culture of algae. What’s more, our project - the automatic water element recovery device and theirs- usage of bacteria and algae for power generation also have a high degree of upstream and downstream cooperation relationship.
In addition, Hust-China team also helped us to freeze the parts and helped us solve the problem of sending samples.

Software
Best Software Tool Special Prize
Regardless of the topic, iGEM projects often create or adapt computational tools to move the project forward. Because they are born out of a direct practical need, these software tools (or new computational methods) can be surprisingly useful for other teams. Without necessarily being big or complex, they can make the crucial difference to a project's success. This award tries to find and honor such ""nuggets"" of computational work.
To compete for the Best Software Tool prize , please describe your work on this page and also fill out the description on the judging form .

Introductory Lab Session - 27th July 2009
Introduction
Last week the team had completed the ethanol precipitation of the GFP and RFP (in plasmids pSB1A2 and pSB1AT3 respectively) DNA samples. They are midi-prepped plasmid DNA samples extracted using Sigma-Aldrich's GenElute Midi-prep kit , however the ethanol present in Wash Solution 2 hadn't been completely removed so ethanol precipitation was necessary. With the ethanol removed, it should be analyse the samples through DNA gel electrophoresis.
Practical Outline
Run the GFP and RFP plasmid DNA samples on gel through DNA gel electrophoresis and analyse.

Ethics & synthetic biology
Synthetic biology strives towards using engineering principles to the practice of biology and  makes the development of biological systems possible, including development of entire  organisms, which don’t exist in nature and serve solely specified human purposes. Synthetic  biology relies on genetic engineering techniques of recombinant DNA that were first  developed in the 1970s, but synthetic biology hopes to bring these techniques many steps  forward. It aims at the development of genetic sequences that can serve as standardized  modules and be used in standardized platform organisms to cause those organisms to  exhibit predictable behaviours.
This rapidly advancing technology raises ethical questions about benefits and harms that  have not been thoroughly addressed and are subject to a worldwide debate. For example,  many countries of the EU are attempting to completely ban the use of GMOs in agriculture  and food, but on the other hand, many other countries such as the USA are growing more  and more genetically modified crops. Synthetic organisms raise questions about public  health, environmental contamination, and even abuse. This technology could be very  dangerous, if it ever falls into the wrong hands, since it could be used for bioterrorism. Other  concerns that have a more religious nature are about the very idea of creating synthetic  organisms. These tap into our instincts about what is natural and what is our relationship to  the natural world, but also about the intrinsic value of human creativity and industry.
But like most things, not even synthetic biology is purely black and white. It also opens door  to numerous practical applications of living organisms, especially bacteria. It could make our  lives easier, safer and better and could even help us to do more to preserve the  environment. Medicine, agriculture, waste treatment, fuel production and pharmaceutics  are just some of the possible are where synthetic biology could mean an enormous  breakthrough and a solution to many of our problems. One possible invention it could bring  is personalized medicine tailored to each individual. These would be more efficient than  normal medicines and would also cause fewer side effects. Also, in most cases these  applications would require GMOs, safely trapped in bioreactors; therefore the fear of these  organisms being released into naturel is redundant.

2. pBAD::mKeima ( BB_K2060001 ).
We aimed to grow these biobrick-containing bacteria in the presence of arabinose to induce expression of each construct and then measure the fluorescence and bioluminescence of the bacteria to assess:
1. Whether the proteins were correctly expressed by analysis of the appropriate spectra
2. Whether there is a change in light output when different bacterial cultures were mixed prior to analysis of appropriate spectra
Initially we sub-cultured overnight bacterial cultures (1/10) and grew for 3hours prior to induction of gene expression by addition of arabinose at various concentrations for approximately 6hours.
Following induction we used a Cary XXXX to measure fluorescence and bioluminescence across appropriate spectra. The LUXoperon has been previously shown to emit light at 488nm whilst the emission wavelength of mKeima is 620nm. We also used a non-biobrick construct expressing pBAD::sfGFP as a control, for which  the emission wavelength is 510nm.
Results
Firstly we grew biobrick-containing E.coli overnight and after sub-culturing (1/10) grew for 2hr before induction with mM concentrations of arabinose.
Figure 1 shows that at these concentrations (5-20mM) of arabinose, bacteria containing the native LUXoperon showed a predicted bioluminescence spectra. However none of the other bacteria were bioluminescent.
Figure 2 shows that at these concentrations (5-20mM) of arabinose, bacteria containing sfGFP showed a predicted fluorescent spectra. However none of the other bacteria showed any fluorescence across the range of tested wavelengths.
Previous work has demonstrated that mKeima expression under the pBAD promotor was best at lower concentrations of arabinose. Therefore we grew bacterial sub-cultures for 6hr in 100uM and 250uM Arabinose (Figure 3 and 4). Unfortunately this did also not show bioluminescence or fluorescence that was suggestive of mKeima expression.
Finally we attempted to stimulate expression of the mKeima-containing biobricks BB_K2060001 and BB_K2060002 by growing bacterial cultures overnight and spiking in arabinose at 10mM for 2hr before measurement.
Figure 5 demonstrates that the LUXoperon-mKeima gave a bioluminescent blue-light output, indicating that the LUXoperon is working correctly. However"
CLSB-UK,2017,Team:CLSB-UK#Fluorometer_-_-_TEXT.html," Digispark pretends to be a keyboard, that types the results extremely quickly into the computer it’s plugged into. The interpreter software can intercept this, along with other keyboard events for changing the settings to provide useful output.
As processing is shifted onto the device it’s plugged into, data analysis is much easier as readings can be automatically logged and exported to spreadsheets. With Judd-UK’s feedback, readings can be marked with ‘recording numbers’, making it easy to do batch measurements. Also based off their feedback, we added a button to export only the ‘recorded’ data to csv. See the collaborations page for more details.
Showing Judd-UK our fluorometer and densitometer.
This framework makes the device easier to modify as a few lines can be changed on the webpage rather than reconfiguring the Arduino board or rewiring the circuit with different components. This in turn also reduces the risk of irreversibly damaging the hardware through bugs in the code. Website programming is much more forgiving than Arduino programming, allowing people with less experience to modify the software. It is also much easier to debug as computers can spit out error messages to the screen.
Moving the complicated processing to the device it is plugged into also means you can use cheaper components in the fluorometer, further reducing the cost. It allows smaller and fewer components to be used, making the device more portable and easier to build.
The interpreter is designed to be used continuously. While the fluorometer is logging data, you can use the keyboard shortcuts to change the options.
Instructions
Our digisparks came with pins free - if yours do too, solder the pins to the board first so you can more easily swap components out if it doesn’t work.
To snap them simply use 2 sets of needle-nose pliers at the point you want them to break and twist.
If you don’t already have a soldering iron check your electrical engineering, physics department or local hackspaces. Most of the time they’ll give you instructions, but if not or you just want more guidance there’s lots of advice online on how to get started soldering. We were lucky enough to be trained by our physics teacher, but sparkfun’s guide looks pretty good too! Don’t hold us responsible for your safety - if in doubt ask someone who knows what they’re doing.
Our one warning is about the light sensors (TSL235R) - the pins are easy to break and they are fairly expensive so be careful with them!

Note there’s just one LED - if you solder both the optical density and fluorescence LEDs seperately and use pin"

Medal criteria
Nottingham iGEM team have been keeping the medal requirements in mind whilst working hard on their project. Below is a list of the completed criteria to earn each medal.
Models were created to give insights into the use of lytic vs temperate phage and to determine whether the treatment would be more successful over a prolonged period if the phage kept its ability to enter the lytic cycle rather than removing this ability to produce a strictly temperate phage. It was also used to study how these impacted on the titre of phage that would need to be administered.
Integrated human practices: We consulted with experts from within the field from various universities across the UK, including University of Birmingham and University of Leeds, as well as holding a discussion group with non-scientists. This allowed us to inform the decisions we made in both the lab design and the modelling. The discussion group were concerned about the delivery of the phage and it was suggested by an expert that delivery should be by capsule. This was therefore chosen as the delivery method for the phage therapeutic, rather than using injection. The discussion group were also concerned about how elderly people would be informed about the new therapeutic therefore, a leaflet about phage therapy was created which could be given to patients to provide advice. Our integration is summarised in a flow diagram on our Wiki. We have also created a human practices gold guide to help future iGEM teams with their human practices.
We have improved the characterisation of the part BBa_J23119 by the addition of an RBS and GFP, and characterised its fluorescence relative to iGEM InterLab control plasmids, using the calibration curves generated during the InterLab study. The new composite part used for this characterisation was BBa_K2715119. Additionally as part of our collaborative studies, we invited two other iGEM teams to characterise our composite parts using their equipment and calibration curves, and"
Uppsala-Sweden,2011,Team:Uppsala-Sweden#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," template of the green light sensor, which includes the two genes ccaR, ccaS and the PcpcG2 promotor (see protocol ccaR BioBrick, protocol ccaS BioBrick & protocol PcpcG2 BioBrick). Voigt(UCSF) provided the green sensor, the red sensor and PcpcG2 on plasmid pJT122 (11,088 bp) [ Tabor et al 2011 ].
Green&Blue output
Site-specific mutagenesis was performed on amilGFP and amilCP in order to remove illegal EcoRI sites within the genes (protocol amilGFP_EcoRI, protocol amilCP_EcoRI).
After lunch we did a plasmid preparation of the overnight cultures from 2011-07-04.
Red sensor
At the end of the day we performed colony PCR to verify the length of the single clone we got of red light sensor (cph8) strain.
2011-07-06
Preparation of agarose gel (1%) for the gel electrophoresis. Then we ran our PCR products from 11-07-05 on the gel.
Finally we initiated the first BioBrick assembly. The following entities were assembled:
Chromophore
RBS (B0034) + pcyA (I15009) - Lidaw, Pikkei & Johanna
RBS (B0034) +ho1 (I15008 ) - Erik L & Tomas
Red output
PompC (R0082) + Inv.cl (Q01511) – Kalle, Hamid, Ismael
The plasmids were cut, the enzymes heat inactivated. After mixing the upstream parts, the downstream parts and the backbones, T4 ligase was added and the ligation mixes were left over night in room temperature.
Evalutation: We couldn’t observe any band on the gel corresponding to cph8. Thus the transformation of cph8 has failed completely. We came up with the following conclusions: either there were no or little DNA in the iGEM kit, or the kit just contained something else.
All the other gels were successful but the band for pcpcG2 was slightly weak. The gel bands for ccaR and ccaS looked good. Hence, we have successfully PCR amplified the green sensor parts. Also, the PCR products from the site directed mutagenesis of amilCP_EcoRI and amilGFP_EcoRI showed strong and clear bands at the expected size. Furthermore"
