The graghs above show that when multiple enzyme B and enzyme C respectively, the productive rate of HBP and the consumption rate of DBT almost stay the same. But regarding the quantity of the intermediate, with more expression of enzyme DszB, the reaction becomes more stable.
We can get a linear inequality equation based on the level of importance of three enzymes: DszB>DszC>DszA.
Under real conditions, we could regulate the intensity of the promoters in order to regulate the enzymes’ proportion.
3. Water-Oil Ratio Model
The process of fermentation is shown as below:
3.1 Theories
Recently, the studies found that the number of DBP and HBP stored in the cytoplasm is determined by the cytoplasm and the distribution coefficient of oil phase and water phase. We managed to derive the best proportion of water and oil in the reactor to optimize our system.
We collected information and listed the distribution coefficient of DBT and HBP in different phrases by searching the literature:
3.2 Related parameters
Distribution coefficient refers to the proportion of the components in two phrases, in the condition of equilibrium and certain temperature.
3.3 Modeling
Hypotheses:
1).The volume percentage of the cell constantly maintains at 3%.
2).The stirring rate is fast enough to approach the chemical equilibrium and materials transfer balance at a fairly quick speed.
Construction:
In order to meet the actual need of making the remaining DBT least while maximizing the product HBP in oil phase, we establish the following models in order to eliminate the remaining DBT in the oil and preserve the HBP as much as possible:
In the initial state, the amount of DBT is a constant:
In the final state, the amount of HBP becomes a constant:
Assume that the volume is 1, then:
Substitute the known quantity into the equation, we get:
Which are equal to:
According to the actual demands, we define:
Which are:
Substitute the known quantity:
We can derive: xH2O≤0.08818349 or xH2O≥0.470590405
Because we can not calculate a result to satisfy both two optimal solutions, we take aonther new evaluation method.
Definition:
M1 represents the level of importance of DBP: 
M2 represents the level of importance of HBP: 
Because the toxicity of organic solvent has direct impact on the living of bacteria, then:
M is a parameter that has a positive correlation with the optimization of"
Cambridge,2012,Team:Cambridge#SD#DesignProcess_-_-_TEXT.html,"encourt iGEM project. They have built a system optimised for 'E.coli', the system proposed would need to be compatible with 'Bacillus subtilis'.
It involves an 'inducer' supplied in the germination medium. This is either unstable and degrades at a regular rate, or is consumed by the bacteria. Loss of inducer releases repression of the kill switch: a unique endo-nuclease targets the anti-toxin gene for destruction. The toxic gene product now mediates cell death of it's host cell and also neighbouring cells in the medium.
This is a neat, synthetic biology solution. Such systems are in need of refinement if synthetic biology is going to be a viable technology to release into the world.

Aberdeen_Scotland,2009,Team:Aberdeen Scotland#ethics_-_-_TEXT.html," drive for the minimal genome has raised questions about a working definition of ‘life’, whether this will differ from what we regard as ‘human life’ and the threat of a definition of life working solely in terms of DNA.  The most common phrase thrown around this area is the accusation of ‘playing God’.  The definition of ‘life’ is key to much of the confusion and uncertainty in this area of study.  Although it is often said a large part of the objection from this kind of work comes from religious sensibilities, there is no real definition of life amongst the major religions of the world, indeed they often rely on the same scientific definitions such as ‘metabolic properties, the ability to respond to the environment or replication.’ (Cho et al, 1999).  Indeed the search for a ‘minimal genome’ could be misleading as there may be multiple minimal genomes ‘depending on what the organism is expected to do and under what environmental circumstances the organism is placed.’ (Cho et al, 1999).  It is not only religion which is struggling with an acceptable definition and understanding of what constitutes life.  Aristotle’s scala naturae, which would later become the ‘Great Chain of Being’ in Christian theology, was more descriptive than explanatory, although Aristotle at least went into some effort to describe the different nature of souls present on different tiers of the scale.  There was no serious attempt to do more than classify and scale in formal epistemology.  In discussing the history of knowledge Foucault said ‘At the end of the eighteenth century, the description and analysis of these natural beings showed, through the use of more highly perfected instruments and the latest techniques, an entire domain of objects, an entire field of relations and processes which have enabled us to define the specificity of biology in the knowledge of nature.  Can one say that research into life has finally constituted itself in biological science?  Has the concept of life been responsible for the organisation of biological knowledge?  I don’t think so.  It seems to me more likely that the transformations of biological knowledge at the end of the eighteenth century were demonstrated on one hand by a whole series of new concepts for use in scientific discourse and on the other hand gave rise to a notion like that of life which has enabled us to designate, to delimit, and to situate a certain type of scientific discourse, among other things.  I would say that the notion of life is not a scientific concept; it has been an epistemological indicator of which the classifying, delimiting, and other functions had an effect on scientific discussions, and not on"

** A PCR takes 20-30 seconds to extend a sequence by 1kb, and since our longest sequence is ~2kb the extension time was determined to be 60s per cycle.
Gel Electrophoresis of PCR-Amplified gBlocks
An agarose gel was prepared according to the agarose prepartion protocol.

PCR Results
The 7 bands corresponding to expected DNA sizes were excised using a razor blade for cleaning and extraction. The other sequences, along with J which only showed a very weak band, will be re-PCRed under modified conditions at a later date.
The excised gel chunks were transferred to centrifugation tubes.
Extraction of DNA (PCR product) from Agarose Gel
The extraction was performed using the E.Z.N.A. Gel Extraction Kit made by Omega Biotek, according to the Spin Protocol.
The excised agarose chunks needed to be dissolved in a minimum of 1mL of XP2 Binding Buffer per gram of gel. The heaviest chunk of gel weighed 0.16g and as such 160µl of buffer was added to each tube.

Cadets2Vets,2017,Team:Cadets2Vets#Improve_-_-_TEXT.html," boards. Cadets2Vets improved upon this model by building a box for ultraviolet imaging and altering the software that captures the image. The imager can provide users with a more accurate idea of the arsenic concentration of a sample.
Additionally, Cadets2Vets has eliminated the potentially messy and complex “kit” system used by many other assays by employing a paper-based system. The entire reaction mix can instead be lyophilized into a paper ticket, which is much easier to deal with than free DNA in a test tube. Finally, Cadets2Vets has designed a circuit that functions in vitro, meaning out of cell, as opposed to the Gaston Day School’s ""inside of cell"" experiments.
Our in vitro circuit allows us to test a greater range of arsenic concentrations, since exposure of arsenic to bacterial cells in vivo can adversely affect their viability.
university of edinburgh
A second team from the University of Edinburgh designed an arsenic sensor using pH and arsenic regulatory proteins in 2006. While the Edinburgh circuit contained several promoters, involving LacZ, urease, ArsR, and ArsD, the Cadets2Vets circuit only includes one constitutive ArsR promoter and GFP reporter. Due to the Edinburgh team’s reliance on pH, their results were susceptible to concentrations of phosphates and bicarbonates in the environmental samples tested. Like the Gaston Day School, the Edinburgh team also performed their experiments in situ.
University of Edinburgh’s entire purpose for including multiple promoters was to create a high dynamic range for arsenic detection. Cadets2Vets found a simpler way of achieving greater range by utilizing in vitro expression in a paper-based ticket. In vitro, the maximum concentration for our circuit is that which denatures our DNA, which would undermine any synthetic biological construct. Due to the fundamentally simpler nature of our circuit and resultant cost efficiency, as well as immunity to pH fluctuation in the environment, our sensor would be easier to produce and use in the field.
Team Cornell
Finally, a team from Cornell created a bacteria-based biosensor that would directly output electrical current. While the electrical signal did avoid the interpretation of fluorescence required by the use of regulatory proteins, it created a much larger problem.
The electrical signal produced by a bacterial construct would be small, requiring an amplifier to increase the signal for interpretation. Within this amplification processes lies inherent uncertainty, due to external noise and electrical current variability; as a result, conclusions on arsenic concentration could prove to be dangerously skewed.
For these reasons, the Cadets2Vets team believes that we have produced a novel, inexpensive, and"

1.5 Robust Design to enable Multiple Plug-and-Play Modules
Technical Challenges and Complexities of this Project
This project looks deceptively simple superficially, because it is built using Lego Mindstorms, the same pieces that middle school students often used in competitions like the FLL (FIRST Lego League).  The fact that the sole developer, Gabriel, is only 11 years old might also create a wrong impression that this project is simple. However, looks are extremely deceiving and the external industry experts and advisors on this team can also testify to that.  Please take a look at Gabriel's bio and you will agree that he is no ordinary 7th grader.
There is an extremely vast difference between this project and other Lego Mindstorms Robot projects, in terms of technical complexities, which we will explain below.
Overcoming Limitations of Lego Mindstorms
Our team has chosen to use Lego Bricks as our hardware platform, because it is easily available, and replicable. However, Lego Mindstorms NXT uses integer math which does not give us the level of precision needed to position the pipette head accurately at each of the 96 wells or control the pump to aspirate a few microliters of liquid. Hence we replaced the Lego NXT firmware with RobotC firmware that is developed by Carnegie Mellon University Robot Academy. RobotC provided us the needed precision using floating point mathematics.
Another limitation of Lego Mindstorm is the programming environment. The simple drag-and-drop iconic interface from Lego Mindstorm might be sufficient for a typical middle school student, but does not give us a enough flexibility to develop the highly complex sophisticated programs that is needed for this project. We have selected RobotC which provide us complete freedom of programming style using a “C” like language, with rich feature sets.
Computing reverse triangulation in 3-D space
Determining the position of a point accurately in 3-D space using a constrained 3-D Polar Coordinant System can be difficult. Here, any position on or above the well can be described in terms of x, y and z"
FAU_Erlangen,2018,Team:FAU Erlangen#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," Marburg and Team Bielefeld 2017. We lacked nothing and had a great time in Marburg.
The European meetup in Munich
Since our experiences in Marburg were so overwhelmingly postitive, between the 20th and 22th of July, our members David, Sven, Franzi, Flo, Verena Lena and Selina also participated in the European iGEM Meetup hosted by the iGEM Team of LMU/TU Munich. After arriving on Friday, we were invited to witness talks of both domestic and international scientists in the field of synthetic biology and bioengineering.
Following up the very informative talks we joined the poster session, where we could both introduce members of other teams to our project, and also listen to them explaining their respective ideas. Thereby it was possible to exchange ideas and valuable advice regarding the course of the projects. Due to the interdisciplinary nature of iGEM, the variety of different topics we could discuss about with our peers was simply overwhelming. For example, we could exchange knowledge about our Markov-chain simulations with computer scientists, and also discuss the characteristics of our used S-Layer proteins with fellow structural biologists.
The evening of the first day offered another opportunity to get in touch with the other teams, and to establish first contacts with peers from all around Europe. Here we want to remark the teams of TU Eindhoven, LMU/TU Munich, Graz and Hamm-Lippstadt in particular, with which we had great conversations and also resonated beautifully on a personal level.
The second day saw more enlightening talks and another poster session, with the additional introduction of workshops, where iGEMers could improve their soft skills in diverse research-related fields such as finance or project management, predominantly hosted by other teams.
The European meetup left us with an overwhelming impression. It gave our team members a first taste of what it means to be a scientist, to meet up with peers at conferences and to have constructive discussions about fascinating scientific topics. We want to wholeheartedly thank the iGEM Team Munich for the great organization of the event and even more so for their sincere, welcoming attitude towards their guests. The meetup will surely remain as an experience our attending team members will not forget too soon.

We moved on from educating children mainly primary kids to high school students grade 11 from ___ school and UCCKE school. We used the same workshop which is the extraction of DNA as a medium of teaching the concepts of synthetic biology. materials for fruit DNA extraction experiments were given to groups of students to let them try out the implementation of scientific principles, and of course, have fun learning science!  Not only that, we added more background about synthetic biology by introducing them the Central Dogma, the Recombinant Biology and the Biobricks using minecraft as an analogy.

Could use http://medbac.dk/slst/pacnes in order to make a new BT phylogeny. -> from research proposal.
Talked with people about project integration, tested known protein stuff, something seems to have broken. -> Bugfixing -> issues between unix and dos newlines. dos2unix to the rescue.
Week 9 (16th)
Got a bunch of errors out of the program, it should now be a lot stricter about letting sequences into the HMM’s. The known_protein_pipeline seems to function now.
Thoughts on Pipeline structure:
¿¿Should bash calls be their own function -> “bash_” + thing_you’re_making() ?? (align_files does not do this)
Anything I might reuse should be its own function -> sensible_name()
Anything both pipelines use should probably be in a separate (super?) file -> eg make_dir, global dir vars, ¿all dir vars?
¿An interface for global vars and things such as extensions?
All functions/scripts should have a docstring -> also usable as usage thing
Should all userinput be caught with inflags? (run_get_cry does not do this right now)
Having user input set to true should always be the default, but I usually call my functions without it in the main pipeline.
Known_pipeline_v1.py is now complete and PEP acceptable, Going to start working on the FFpred tools wrapper,
Going to try to do the Machine Learning/Pattern Recognition wrapper in R using these programs and R.peptides commands:
R (peptides.lengthpep)

Bielefeld-CeBiTec,2016,Team:Bielefeld-CeBiTec#Results#Mutation#Reversion_-_-_TEXT.html,"ulate that one reversed beta-lactamase gene can confer ampicillin resistance to     the cell. Therefore, the observed mutation rate is 100 to 300 fold higher than the true mutagenesis rate. Additionally, potential     reversion sites on each plasmid contribute to the underestimation of the mutation rate. The stop codon TAA can mutate into nine     different codons, which include two new stop codon (TGA, TAG). In total, there are seven mutation possibilities on every plasmid     which could revert the stop beta-lactamase back to its functional state. These considerations lead to the modification of equation     one to equation and.
Equation 2: Modified equation to determine the mutation rate by mutant accumulation considering a reporter with a stop codon on a plasmid.
To measure the mutation rate similar conditions for each replicate were choosen. The setup looked as following. JS200 cells     carrying either pHSG-EP Pol I or pHSG-WT Pol I were transformed with 10 ng pLA230, regenerated for 60 min in SOC and transferred     LB with chloramphenicol and kanamycin. After 24 h the cell count was determined by OD600, the cells were serial diluted and appropriate     dilutions were plated on LB plates with ampicillin and grown at 30°C.
The reversion frequency f was determined by counting ampicillin resistant colonies and normalizing this value by the number of cells     measured via OD600. Therefore, we assumed OD600 as 5×108 cells. This experiment was done in five biological replicates     both with the error prone polymerase I as well as with the wild type polymerase I.
Equation 2: Modified equation to determine the mutation rate by mutant accumulation considering a reporter with a stop codon on a plasmid.
An increase in reversion frequency by a factor of 2.7×103 when using the EP Pol I in contrast to WT Pol I     was observed. In this evolution of the reversion experiment the controls pre mutagenesis were not plated, which prevents     exact determination of the change in reversion frequency. This leads to us using plating to determine the viable cell count in addition to the revertant count.
Due to obvious difference between the error-prone and the wild type polymerase I, we reduced consumption of material by only     characterizing the error prone polymerase in further detail. Major obstacles when trying to measure revertants in wild-type     cultures were the trait offs in respect to the number of plated cells. Plating too few cell leads to"

WashU,2010,Team:WashU#Notebook#Yeast_-_-_TEXT.html," overnight FY4 culture using a spectrophotometer and a nanodrop
Spectrophotometer gave a reading of 1.220
Nano drop gave readings of .282, 0.347, 0.360
The nanodrop has a 1mm pathlength while the spectrophotometer has a 1 cm pathlength so there is an expected factor of 10 difference
We later became aware that the spectrophotometer cannot measure saturated cultures accurately so we conducted a more thorough experiment.
The culture was diluted 5 fold and the absorbance of both the saturated and diluted cultures were measured.

Oxford,2015,Team:Oxford#TestDuke#Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," nurses abourtour idea. We organized a trip to the Adams Ward (Geratology) to learn more about how urinary infections affect elderly people.
First interview with Laura Evans, Adams Ward
What is the procedure for treating UTIs?
Dip urine
If the test comes back as positive, treat with a wide spectrum antibiotic
Whether or not the catheter is inserted with prophylactic antibiotic treatment is the doctor’s decision
What happens when a patient tests positive for a urinary infection?
Whether or not the catheter is removed if a patient tests positive for a urinary infection depends largely on the reason that the catheter has been fitted. On the whole, the catheter remains fitted and the patient is treated with a large dose of antibiotics.
Is antibiotic resistance a problem?
Yes, particularly on this ward. As we treat elderly patients with recurring infections, their UTIs are frequently resistant to antibiotic treatment. We try different combinations of antibiotics but recurring infections are a significant problem.
Our project involves designing a catheter that prevents the formation of a biofilm on its surface. What do you think of this idea?
A catheter like that would be useful, but it depends on how long your catheter would work for. Patients can have catheters fitted for 3 months or longer. Catheters are also removed for other reasons, for example if they become blocked. Blockage is particularly an issue when the patient is suffering from a urinary infection.
Laura’s response regarding how long a catheter remains in place spurred us into researching how we could keep our Solution bacteria alive. This is what we found.
The Problem
Following our inspiring visits to the Churchill and John Radcliffe hospitals, we wanted to find out the public thought about the problem of antibiotic resistance. We posed the question: To what extent do you feel that antibiotic resistance is a problem that needs addressing in society today?
Our survey clearly shows that, according to the general public, antibiotic resistance is an important problem that needs solving. Therefore we felf it was a useful area to direct our project towards. One of our team members, George, worked in a UTI clinic over the summer of 2014, so he knows first-hand that UTIs are a big problem for a lot of people and that, in severe cases, current methods of treatment are inadequate. When he brought this to our attention, we thought it was worthwile trying to find a solution to this problem.
Feedback from Oxford Experts
To gain a further insight into the feasibility of Solution, we gave two talks during the summer, one at the termly Corpus Christi College Biochemistry talks and another to a group"

Below, you will find a schematic representation of the system our biochemical modelling was performed on. The crossed-over enzymes and proteins have not been modelled as a differential equation but considered as constants in the system.

The important enzymes in the system are mathematically represented by a differential equation under the assumption of steady state in the system and modelled in a demo version of the program Berkeley Madonna .
Figure 3: Picture from the modelling program Berkeley Madonna, showing a model example.
When light hits the photo receptor SopII, the signal is transduced through the HtrII and Tar and onto the enzyme CheW. CheW is then activated because it is a straight-forward signal transduction. The proteins SopII and HtrII are not considered in the model and the equation for the activation of CheW is:
When the CheW enzyme is activated, it induces auto-phosphorylation of CheA. The phosphorylated CheA can then phosphorylate the enzymes CheY and CheB. The equation for CheA-p concentration is given by:
Phosphorylated CheY is produced by phosphorylation of CheA and is removed by CheZ which, in this model, is defined by a constant k. This can be described mathematically by this equation:
Phosphorylated CheB is dephosphorylated when methylated Tar is demethylated, this can be described mathematically by this equation:
Methylated Tar is constantly produced by the CheR enzyme which, in this model, is also considered a constant. The demethylation is performed by CheB-p. The concentration of methylated Tar can be described by this equation:
In Berkeley Madonna it is possible to define different parameters as sliders which enable the user to change parameters continually while the model is running. The sliders used in the model are:

Concordia,2013,Team:Concordia#Interface_-_-_TEXT.html," The development of this signal, and its subsequent effects, requires the presence of two critical AHL genes; Lux I and Lux R. After many decades of research, it is now evident that Lux I and Lux R homologues exist in almost all the cases of AHL signaling (Galloway 2011).
AHL synthase
The first AHL gene required for the completion of AHL signaling pathway is; the ‘I’ type gene. This gene encodes an AHL synthase which is the basis of the AHL signal formation. AHL synthases require two cytoplasmic substrates in order to create an AHL; S-Adenosylmethionine (SAM) and Acyl carrier protein (ACP) (Boyer 2009).
The chemical reaction responsible for AHL creation, and catalyzed by the synthase, is the formation of an amide bond between SAM and the acyl side chain of ACP. This acylation is then followed by a lactonization, yielding the final products; the AHL signal, a holo-acyl carrier protein, and the remaining 5’-methy-thioadenosine group from SAM (Galloway 2011). Each AHL synthase acquires its specificity, in terms of creating its proper AHL signal, by a variable C domain used to recognize a particular ACP side chain (Boyer 2009).
AHL receptor
Additionally, the ‘R’ type gene is reqiured. This gene encodes an AHL receptor which is crucial for AHL recognition as well as DNA transcriptional modification. AHL receptors bind their exclusive AHL using the variable N domain, and also specifically bind their target DNA sequence using the conserved C domain (Boyer 2009).
Receptor-AHL binding is triggered by a threshold accumulation of AHL inside the cell; while its subsequent specificity is regulated by the chemical structure of the variable side chain found on the AHL signal. Crosstalk can sometimes arise when AHL signals are structurally or chemically related; that is to say they have similar carbon chain lengths and oxidation levels (Boyer 2009).
Receptor-DNA binding is mediated by receptor-AHL binding, and is specifically executed using a unique target DNA sequence; termed the ‘lux-box-like sequence’. This sequence is found in the promoter region of AHL-receptor targeted genes (Greenberg 2000). These target sequences are conserved in terms of DNA binding reception but are also variable enough to provoke specificity dictated by the structure of the particular receptor protein being bound. In some cases, such as the LuxI/R AHL signaling pathway, these target sequences can be"

These statistical results confirm the global robustness of the system, which will remain efficient even under a reasonable degree of uncertainty.
Metabolic control analysis
Metabolic Control Analysis (MCA) is a mathematical tool widely used in biotechnology to quantify the influence of a specific parameter on the functioning of the system, in terms of fluxes and concentrations. Working with a system governed by a large number of parameters, MCA allows to determine the influence of each of them towards each variable of the system. 2
Usually applied to investigate the control of concentrations and fluxes under steady state conditions, we have extended the concepts of MCA to quantify the control exerted by each parameter on the response time (τ), which depends on the system dynamics. For each parameter (p), the control coefficient (C) was calculated as:
\begin{equation*} C = \frac{(\tau(p)-\tau((1+\delta).p))/\tau(p)}{(p - (1+\delta).p)/p} \end{equation*}
Each coefficient quantifies the relative change in the response time τ in response to a relative change δ of the parameter p. If the response time is not impacted by the parameter p, the corresponding coefficient will be zero. A positive (negative) value indicates that an increase in p increases (reduces) the response time. A coefficient of 1 indicate that a change in x % of the parameter results in a change of x % of the response time.
Control coefficients were calculated by numerical differentiation (δ set at 0.01). To reduce calculation times and increase the accuracy of the calculated coefficients, we used the event function of Matlab: integration stops as soon as the concentration in Vibrio cholerae reach a non-pathogenic concentration, and the solver returns the exact τ value. This sensitivity analysis was performed for a wide range of initial concentration of Vibrio cholerae to ensure the genericity of its outcome, and results are presented as a heatmap. The Matlab script used to calculated control coefficient and generate the heatmap (SimBiology needed) are available below.

Luckily, our design can be an alternative and suitable choice for patients, especially for those who are hyperuricemia but don’t have gout, as using the merit of intestinal flora, letting them colorize in patients’ gut can reduce the frequency of taking medicine. If our design can come true, then it will be a totally new and harmless method in the cure of hyperuricemia or gout.
The conversation with Dr. Liu benefited us a lot and gave us confidence to keep doing such research, as we had confirmed that what we aim to do has necessity and is valuable to the clinical circumstance. In addition, the supportive attitude and encouragement Dr. Liu gave us rendered us firmed our determination to make this year’s project as perfect as we can.
2. West China Hospital Visiting for the 2nd time With Dr. Yi Zhao, Dr. Chunyu Tan, Dr. Min Yang, Dr. Xiaomin Cen, Dr. Hua Zhao, Dr. Beibei Cui
After the last exchange with Dr. Yi Liu, we found that the direct communication with clinical doctor was very helpful and efficient for us to understand the status of clinical treatment and to improve our project. As a therapeutic project, doctor's advice was essential to us. Therefore, relying on the advantageous resources of West-China Hospital Sichuan University, we contacted Dr. Yi Zhao, Dr. Chunyu Tan, Dr. Min Yang, Dr. Xiaomin Cen, Dr. Hua Zhao, and Dr. Beibei Cui these six doctors, and we communicated directly with them face to face about what we wanted to know and what they suggested about our project.
We first asked the current situation and existing problems of clinical blood uric acid concentration lowering therapy for hyperuricemia and gout. The doctors' answers were basically similar. At present, the clinical use of blood uric acid concentration lowering drugs can basically reduce uric acid in patients and have less adverse reactions, but the biggest problem is the poor compliance of patients. Since the treatment cycle of acid lowering is very long, most patients stop taking medicine when they are not painful, so the treatment effect is difficult to achieve. At the same time, doctors tend to advise patients to control their diet and try to eat less-purine food, but patients are often unwilling to adhere to the doctor’s advice, causing the poor acid lowering effects. In addition, there is controversy over whether to use drugs on patients"

Survey Summary
Unfortunately, based off of the results from our surveys, we can conclude that the knowledge about GMOs, biotechnology, and coral reefs is relatively low in the homeschool communities. However, there are a range of answers so we cannot assume that our results are representative of all homeschooling families. Fortunately, we found that there is an increased desire for more information on the aforementioned topics to be implemented into educational programs and materials. Overall, from our survey we learned that there needs to be more educational materials and training available for homeschool educators so that they may be more confident and better suited to teach their students about biotechnology and GMOs.

The lab of synthetic biology
This year, the USTC iGEM team work at the lab of synthetic biology in the building of the school of life sciences. Besides doing experiments in the lab, we have welcomed some visitors from outside and show them how we conduct our work.
The open day
We conducted the visiting activity in our Synthetic Biology Lab as part of the ""Open Day of Biox "" program during the Week of Science of USTC. This program is annually held for people outside from our campus to get to know more about science. Being part of this program, our lab serves as a visiting site for people to pick up some concepts about synthetic biology. A great range of people, from kids to the elderly are involved in our program. ( GET TO KNOW MORE )

Community Lab
In order to spread the idea of “synthetic biology” to public, we did a lot of brainstorms and came up with plenty of ideas, one of which was to cooperate with Zhejiang Science and Technology Museum (ZJSTM) and exhibit a series of activities to a wide range of people.
After a long and profound discussion with the principal of the museum, we noticed that building up a community lab should be an excellent way to introduce “synthetic biology” to public and ZJSTM would provide us with a certain place for this lab.
Months later, the building of a small lab especially for presentation of life science as well as a stage was completed. The walls of the community lab were especially designed to be made by glass. They are transparent so all visitors of the museum, even children at low age, can watch the whole procedure of some biology experiments with out any risk.
To make full use of the lab and other resources provided by ZJSTM, lots of thoughts were put on how to make the activities presented entertaining while educational.

Stage 2
WPI’s visit to BostonU had two purposes. First, it would help validate WPI’s assay protocol and results in another lab, Second, it would give our team a better understanding of the protocol we would be moving onto a microfluidic device. Two students from WPI, Catherine and Aylin, met with a member of our team in Boston University lab on July 26th. Before performing the experiment in the lab, the WPI team gave a quick overview of the experiment as well as any specific safety protocols required while working with lead. In the lab, the WPI team members performed their protocol in its entirety; the BostonU Team member observed but did not touch any biological materials.
During this process, the two teams discussed various limitations and difficulties found in performing the assay by hand. A difficulty of note was the importance of adding and mixing reagents at exact times. For example, GSH needed to be added between 15-20 seconds after mixing the Lead and Gold Nanoparticles; however, adding the GSH at a uniform time was extremely difficult. With this information in mind, we decided that reliable timing would be an integral part of the microfluidic chip design.
WPI performing their lead assay in the BostonU lab on July 26th 2017. They performed their entire assay in the lab while the BostonU HW team observed and asked questions.
Stage 3
After meeting with WPI in the lab, our team had a solid plan for what the design of the chip would look like. The chip would perform one portion of their assay with volumes scaled down by a factor of 10. It would consist of 5 main sections:
Lead Metering: 4.15 ul
AuNp Metering: 3.46 ul
Lead and AuNp Timed Mixing: 17.5 Seconds
GSH Metering: 1.0 ul
Final Mixing: 18 seconds
With this workflow in mind, the chip on the right was designed. The animation details how liquid would flow through the device.
We provided WPI with full documentation of the chip including SVG files, a usage protocol, and the animation seen to the right. All of these files can be downloaded below.

Today, fish provides more than one billion people with most of their daily animal protein. Fish provides nutrients and micronutrients which are essential to the cognitive and physical development of people, especially of children. It is also an important part of a healthy diet. But heavy metals in water have become a threat to both fish and public health. The EPA (United States Environmental Protection Agency) announced that women living on the East and West Coasts had twice as much mercury in their blood (5.9 parts per billion, or ppb) than inland women (2.4 ppb). Levels higher than 3.5 ppb may pose a threat to the woman or fetus.
We designed two kinds of questionnaires including a Chinese questionnaire and an English questionnaire, in order to enlarge the region of our investigation.The Chinese questionnaire and English questionnaire are basically similar.
We totally acquired 544 questionnaire responses. The survey in China was carried out both online and offline. We used an online survey website and collected 526 effective questionnaires. We also got 18 effective paper questionnaires. As to the English questionnaire, we put it on the website and promoted it. Finally, we recycled 12 effective questionnaires from 5 different countries (German, Canada, USA, UK and Netherlands).

Nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT) is a transcription factor family consisting of 5 members (NFATc1, NFATc2, NFATc3, NFATc4, and NFAT5). NFATc1 and NFATc4 are sensitive to calcium signalling. A high calcium level leads to the exposure of the nuclear localization signal and the transcription factor is transported into the nucleus.

Because of their DNA binding zink finger domain they are involved in gene expression in the role of transcription factors, especially in the early embryonal development, cell growth, diﬀerentiation and tumorigenesis. Kid3 has a Krüppel-associated box domain (KRAB) at the N-terminus, that performs  a transcription repressing function, and a C-terminal C2H2 zink finger domain. The consensus binding sequence of Kid3 is 5'-CCAC(C/G)-3' [66] .

LDL receptor
Low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDL receptor) is a cell surface protein which is responsible for the cholesterol supply of the cell.  The receptor recognizes the protein B100 which is part of the LDL particles. Binding of the B100 protein to the LDL receptor leads to endocytosis via clathrin coated pits. The vesicle fuses with an endosome, the resulting shift in the pH value leads to the detachment of the LDL and the receptor can be transported back to the plasma membrane (receptor recycling). Through this process the cell takes up the cholesterol which is associated with LDL.  LDL accumulation in the blood is responsible for atherosclerosis and many cardiovascular diseases. The LDL gene is regulated by the intracellular level of cholesterol. A low level of cholesterol leads to the activation whereas a high level results in a decrease of transcription [40] .

Figure 7: The percent survival of Nosema-infected honeybees of that were fed a range of E. coli concentrations.
Interestingly, when we look at the Nosema-infected bees, we don’t see any significant differences between any of the bacteria-fed groups against the infected bees that were just fed sugar water, making us comfortable with the conclusion that the bacteria did not cause increased bee mortality. Even the highest tested E. coli concentration did not lead to a significant difference in bee mortality over time or in the overall survival trend. Bee mortality over the time course is therefore expected to a function of natural causes in the variably-aged bee population.
With no pronounced toxic effects induced by ingestion of E. coli, results demonstrate a valuable proof-of-concept that E. coli could be a feasible delivery vehicle of our therapeutic treatment.
Experiment 3: Does PPIX lead to a reduction in spore load?
Of course, we needed address our primary hypothesis: Will ingested PPIX, the same chemical that APIS will produce, decrease the N. ceranae spore load in honeybees in vivo? Both healthy and infected bees were fed with sugar-water supplemented with PPIX at a concentration of 80 uM, which is around the expected production levels enabled by our APIS construct.. In parallel, healthy and uninfected controls were fed regular sugar-water. PPIX was introduced to the feed 24 hours after Nosema infection, then this concentration was held constant for the duration of the treatment. PPIX tubes were wrapped in tin foil to minimize exposure to light and mitigate photosensitive degradation of PPIX. Altogether, there were six conditions tested:
Healthy bees fed regular sugar-water
Healthy bees fed PPIX treatment
Healthy bees fed Tris-base:Ethanol solvent system (solvent control)

3. Characterization of flA and oprF
3.1.1 Protein expression of oprF
Plasmid pET28a-oprF was transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3) for protein expression analysis. The strain was grown in Luria broth containing 100ug/ml kanamycin at 37℃, 250rpm/min until an absorbance of 0.4–0.6 at 600 nm was reached. We then added IPTG to 0.5mM and continued the incubation at 28℃ overnight to induce the overexpression of oprF. The cells were collected, suspended with 10mM imidazole containing 0.1mM protease inhibitor PMSF and then disrupted using Selecta Sonopuls. After centrifugation, the sediment was treated with 1*SDS gel loading buffer and kept in boiling water for 5 minutes and applied to SDS-PAGE.
Figure 3.1: SDS page test of purified recombinant oprF and flA protein.
4. Immunofluorescence analysis of oprF
To identify that whether our oprF has anchored on the cell membrane of E. coli, we performed immunofluorescence assay. HA tag was added to the N-terminal of oprF-GS(linker)-CBP so that the recombinant protein oprF-GS(linker)-CBP-HA can be specifically recognized by anti-HA antibody. When FITC labeled anti-IgG antibody was used as the secondary antibody and interacted with the primary antibody, green fluorescence could be observed in the cell membrane of E. coli under fluorescent microscope.

5. Cu2+ adsorption capacity assay
We have got the evidence of SDS-PAGE and immunofluorescence assay, which confirmed that the recombinant protein oprF-GS(linker)-CBP can be expressed in high level and successfully anchored on the cell membrane in our engineered bacteria. Then, we further investigated its capacity to absorb Cu2+ when incubated in Cu2+-rich environment. Samples of culture medium in different stages was collected and assayed to identify the Cu2+ concentration using BCO method (see more detail of BCO method).

10.TV Interviews
Our iGEM project gets high attention and positive responses from all life sciences teachers and even directors of the Academic Affairs Division Office at Jilin University.
To support our project and spread the influence of iGEM, our Jilin University News Network interviewed our Jilin_China 2016 iGEM Team early in 2016. Through this educational TV exhibition, we shared our project idea as well as basic synthetic biology concepts with the public. We are informed that the interview about us reached a vast audience throughout the whole University.
11.iGEM Alliance
The construction of iGEMUnion was initialized this year with the aim of providing the stage for different groups from all over China to communicate with each other. There were five teams in the iGEMUnion (BIT-China, Tianjin, Jilin_China, CGU and BIT teams), and gradually teams including Peking, NCTU-Formosa and UCAS also participated in the iGEMUnion. We constructed a WeChat group number (iGEM-Union) together and updated our progress and results in it. We also propagandized synthetic biology and iGEM. Through iGEMUnion, all teams are able to communicate their own problems and it is a good stage for teams to collaborate with each other.
12.Youth Education
We always care about the young generation, and we hope our project will have a positive influence on high school students. Therefore, we introduced our project to students at the High School Affiliated to Jilin University. They do not know much about the Synthetic Biology, so we gave a brief introduction about Synthetic Biology and the iGEM competition at the beginning. Then we gave a detailed description about our project. The possibility of using bacteriotherapy to cure cancer was the major topic of our talk, as the major approaches to treat cancer have been radiotherapy, chemotherapy and surgery. We told the students how we designed our genes and how we electrotransfered them into bifidobacteriums. We also explained how our system worked. We also invited them to visit our lab. Not many students showed much interests in our presentation at the beginning of our presentation. However, more and more students showed great interest about our project during our presentation. After we finished our speech, we gave them the e-mail address of our team. Those who are interested in our project could contact our team and get more detailed information about our project and synthetic biology.

Ethics and how the iGEM community Should behave
When working with synthetic biology, we have the urgent need to question our own methods and seek solutions that are focused care and monitor our actions with a clear and correct target. However, as a scientific community, we do not have a clear model to follow regarding this issue.
iGEM ​​encourages teams every year to deepen in this subject and try to improve on the work that has been done, however, although ethics is not a subjective matter, lends itself to interpretations, even when analyzed the same points from as many socio-cultural perspectives, as happens with the iGEM teams.
Every year we witness new breakthroughs in our field, every year we have the opportunity to see how each member of the iGEM community contributes to push the boundaries of knowledge in Synthetic Biology, every year, it is possible to characterize new parts, new vectors and new chassis, and this forces us also to question further.
So the question arises: Where should we draw the line ?, What is the limit to what we can do? and How do we do right?
A few days ago, we read a comic in which a futuristic dystopian perspective on what will be showing the progress of synthetic biology
And it's very funny, and somewhat unrealistic, but shows a potential reality that can happen if you do not take care of our work and we take a position of full responsibility in our day to day.
You can then conclude that it is necessary that the synthetic biology community, and particularly iGEM, which represents the vast majority of those who work in this field, we have an outline to guide us and be our reference for this field.
Professional codes of ethics are a way in which a complete professional community can agree on ethical guidelines on which to follow for the situations. For this, Team BIOSINT_Mexico we stick to an idea:
Create a code of professional ethics for the iGEM community
To validate our idea, we conducted a survey, which was attended by many iGEM teams and asked about his opinion regarding our idea"

After spinning this down, there was a pellet, with chromosomal DNA.
It was difficult to remove the supernatant because the viscous liquid kept getting sucked up and bringing the pellet up with it.
Resuspend pellet in 1/2 volume of original 0.1X bug buster solution

Mix to get an even suspension by pipetting and vortexing for several minutes and spin down as in step 9.

Store solution at 4C until further required.
I noticed that after a day in the 4C, the solution gelled up.
According to protocol, storage at temperatures below 4°C may cause precipitation of the detergents in BugBuster reagent. Incubate in a room temperature water bath with gentle swirling to redissolve."

Lab Diaries
Overview | Surface Protein Team | XylE Team | Vectors Team | Modelling Team
Here are the technical diaries for our project. We've split them up into three lab teams and the modelling team. We think it's really important that absolutely anyone can find out what we've been doing. For a really detailed look at what we did, and when, you've come to the right place!
Week 4
Day
Monday
Tuesday
Wednesday
Thursday
Friday
Objectives
Piotr, Anita and Kyasha start work on modelling.
Clearly identify all steps of the output pathway and draw out the diagram. Start with the simplest case and build up from there.
Completion
It was recognised that modelling of output amplification model would be beneficial as model could give answer to how many amplification steps would be most effective in given context.
It was decided that other model to be done afterwards would involve modelling the activation of our ComD receptor and the disaply of proteins.
It was concluded that the amplification model except for transcription and translation was involving just enzymatic reactions.
Tried approaching the output amplification model using Michaelis-Menten kinetics as Kyasha had already some experience in doing that.
Decided to have a go on implementing the simple production equations in MatLab.
Week 5
Day
Monday
Tuesday
Wednesday
Thursday
Friday
Objectives
Attempt implementing 1 step amplifcation into Matlab.
Continue developing models/equations/reactions of 2 and 3 step amplification.
Try using TinkerCell to implement the 2 and 3 step amplification systems and then export them to SimBiology MatLab interface for verfication.
Prepare short slide presentation for advisers for 12.00.
Meeting with students from the Royal College of Arts later on during the day.
Keep implementing the models in MatLab.

The design of a scientific research project requires individuals to consider many things besides the science behind it. It is crucial to take into consideration the impact that your research could have on the world. During our design process, we interviewed a series of professionals about their opinions regarding the ethics and safety of our project and integrated their suggestions into our project.
Dr. Wen Xue, UMass Medical School RNA Therapeutics Institute
The interview with Dr. Xue focuses primarily on the potential to do a project based on single nucleotide base changes. His biggest concern was making sure that our system was equipped to handle the large spectrum of expression levels associated with genetic diseases. For example, two people with the same disease can express it differently based on how many mutations are present. By making sure that our system is tunable, we can ensure that both of these people can use our system for treatment. Our solution to this issue was including the reverse tetracycline Trans-activator (rtTa) gene on the end of the enzyme/dCas fusion plasmid. This gene allows us to control the amount of expression in our system by adding and removing Doxycycline. The more Doxycycline that we add to the system, the more expression we should see.
Dr. Erik Sontheimer, UMass Medical School RNA Therapeutics Institute
One of our main concerns when designing our project were the dangers and risks associated with current CRISPR technology with regard to editing the genome. When we spoke with Dr. Sontheimer he was in agreement with our reasoning. He argued that there was no point in spending time and money on treatment that can never actually be used because of risk factors such as off-target mutations. This concern was addressed during our design process when we decided to edit the RNA instead of DNA. Editing RNA allows us to turn off the system if anything were to go wrong and the damage would not be permanent. In the future, this aspect of our system will help us to ensure patients and their families that the risk is minimal.
Zachary Kennedy, Graduate Student at UMass Medical School RNA Therapeutics Institute
The concern brought up with Mr.Kennedy, in his interview, regarded how the public"
Aachen,2018,Team:Aachen_-_-_TEXT.html," and meetups enabled us to unite internationally.
We  also took part in the international March for Science to demonstrate for free accessibility of scientific research, met Emmanuelle Charpentier and by radio, we raised awareness for melatonin-related diseases.
Learn more about our public engagement.
Wetlab
During the last five months, the team experienced a new style of ""life"", we updated our biosafety level and got a new first home.        In the laboratory, gloves and tips, western blots and electrophoresis gels, were part of our new daily routine.        We thought, worked and lived together. Get to know our lab successes and failures in this chronologic weekly overview .
Hardware
For detection of melatonin in saliva, we decided to use LSPR. For this a spectrometer was built, so we are able to see changes in the refraction index,  due to fine changes in the composition of the medium. LSPR makes our sensor a very sensitive device, while a gold nano structure with the binding domain of RZR with streptavidin and biotin is responsible for the high selectivity.
As most of the components of our hardware can be used multiple times, the sensor is very cost efficient.

Nous avons participé à l'enquête mise en ligne par l'équipe UGent sur la biologie synthétique et l’enquête de l'équipe iGEM Purdue sur le projet de caractérisation !
Nous avons rencontré l’équipe de Paris Saclay à l’ISSB le 19 Août afin de discuter de nos projets respectifs.  Lors de cet atelier, chaque équipe a présenté les différents aspects de leur projet: de la biologie à la modélisation en passant par l'éthique. Nous avons ensuite discuté du projet de l'autre et chaque équipe a proposé différentes façons d'améliorer le projet.
Félicitations pour votre médaille d’or !

  First,the user interface. Apple offers developers dozens of UI elements ,which is all in the Apple Style.Developers are encouraged to use Apple designing patterns so that the user can get used to a new App immediately.
  For security problem as well as the efficiency, Apple requires developers to use public APIs given by Apple. This is very important,developers should be very careful about the APIs in their app.
  Of course,The app can not access the user's information without asking for permission.
  One of the most important features for a good app is that it should  not crash. Developers should test carefully on different devices with different iOS version before they submit the app to Apple.
  Last but most important. An app should give users great experience. There is so much work to do to make an app perfect because there are so many details to handle. For example, every picture needs to be optimized so that it can work on devices with retina display. Developers should also offer a user guide to make sure the users can manage to use the app very easily.

Project Overview
Increasing global oil demands require new, innovative technologies for the extraction of unconventional oil sources such as those found in Alberta’s Carbonate Triangle. Carbonate oil deposits account for almost 50% of the world’s oil reserves and approximately 26% of the bitumen found in Alberta 1. Due to unstable oil prices in Western Canada, these vast reserves have historically been set aside in favour of less time consuming, more economical sites. Microbial enhanced oil recovery (MEOR) has been utilized across the world to increase the productivity of difficult resources including carbonate oil deposits. Using a synthetic biology approach, we have designed the CAB (CO2, acetic acid, and biosurfactant) extraction method that demonstrates a modified MEOR method for extracting carbonate oil deposits. CAB extraction will utilize the natural carbon fixation machinery in the cyanobacteria Synechococcus elongatus to convert CO2 into sugars to fuel acetic acid and biosurfactant production in Escherichia coli. Acetic acid applied to carbonate rock increases the pore sizes and allows for enhanced oil recovery. The reaction produces gases that will help pressurize the well site to facilitate extraction. The natural biosurfactant rhamnolipid will also be applied to the carbonate rock to further enhance extraction yields.
By coupling carbon capture with acetic acid and biosurfactant production, carbonate oil deposits can be mined with reduced greenhouse gas emissions. The use of carbon fixation to feed downstream systems can be tailored for use as a module in many applications requiring inexpensive methods for fueling biological systems. CAB extraction will be suitable for large-scale bioreactors, providing an alternative, inexpensive, and environmentally sustainable method for MEOR from Alberta’s oil deposits. Furthermore, developing the carbon capture module will be of interest in oil extraction strategies using steam, as it will help with the mitigation of CO2 release caused by steam production using for example natural gas.

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Degradation_-_-_TEXT.html," RFP gene into E. coli and in degradation part, we transformed some enzymes in purine metabolic pathway into our engineered bacteria. Therefore, no toxic matters will be produce in our bacteria. Our engineered bacteria have either chloramphenicol resistance or ampicillin resistance, which are widely used in the lab and have been widely confirmed to be safe.
Safe organism
We used and only used E. coli in our experiments. The strain of E. coli we use are TOP10, BL21 and DH5α, which means that all the organism we used in our lab are of group 1 risk. In addition, we separated our organisms from other organisms in the lab that are used by others. There is no phage or virus in our lab and our lab is of group 2 risk.
Safe Shipment
We have already sent our parts to iGEM Headquarters. Our parts are not in the select agents and toxins list. They are safe and well packed. There’s no liquid, no organism, no toxin in the package, only plasmids that are allowed to ship. Our parts are on their way to Boston, bon voyage!
Protocol
Add 1g agarose into 100mL 1×TAE buffer. Boil in miccolumnave oven to dissolve the agarose. The agarose concentration depends on the DNA size. 1% is the most commonly used concentration. Add in 5µl view dye in 100mL solution when it is cooled down to 60℃.
Choose the suitable gel tank and insert the comb. The electrophoresis comb according to the purpose. Pour the fluid agarose gel into the tank. After a complete solidification soak the gel in 1×TAE buffer to make the DNA strips clearer.
Pour enough running buffer into the electrophoresis tank and put the agarose gel in the electrophoresis tank.
Mix the sample with loading buffer sufficiently and load them into the sample lane together with proper marker. The choice of the marker is dictated by the size of the target DNA. Some PCR system already add loading.
Run the electrophoresis under 120V.
fter 15-20 min, put the gel in an UV detector and record the picture.
The 50% glycerin should be autoclaved before use.
Mix 600µl bacteria solution with 600µl 50% glycerin separately in two 1.5mL tubes.
Seal the tubes with parafilm.

BIT,2018,Team:BIT#Hardware-Microarray_-_-_TEXT.html,"3.2 Structural design:
The chip is mainly divided into three materials:
PMMA layer, PDMS-CI mixed layer and pure PDMS layer: The PDMS-CI layer is a magnetic film layer, which is mainly made of CI and PDMS. It is one of the electromagnetically driven control elements and will be control liquid drive under the action of electromagnet. The pure PDMS layer is the main constituent material of the chip, which is used to implement various preset functions in the chip, and the PMMA layer is used for supporting the PDMS chip body.
Fig.8 Principle explanation(a)A schematic illustration of the three- phase peristaltic motion. The fluid could be transported by this motion from the loading chamber to the reaction chamber. [5];(b) From top to bottom is fixed layer, top layer, support layer, magnetic film layer, fixed layer; (c)The mask diagram of the chip design.
3.3 Advantages and disadvantages:
Advantages: Compared to conventional peristaltic pump drives, electromagnetic drives are less expensive and smaller. The basic liquid drive can be achieved by simple electromagnetic action. In addition, the combination of the electromagnet and the magnetic film can also be used for the design of the solenoid valve to controlle the channel switch.
Disadvantages: The chamber size parameter of the chip has a great influence on the liquid driving effect, and the parameter exploration is more complicated. The PDMS-CI hybrid membrane production process is complicated and takes a long time. In addition to this, electromagnetic interference will also affect the experimental results.
3.4 Detailed steps to make the chip
3.4.1. Making CI-PDMS film
1) Add a 2:1 mass ratio CI powder and PDMS prepolymer to the centrifuge tube for thorough mixing and then add and mix the PDMS: curing agent mass ratio of 15:1 (curing agent density close to 1).
2) Vacuum pumping using a vacuum pump
3) Turn off the vacuum pump, deflate, and evacuate
4) Open the vacuum pump Check the operation of the silicone machine Note the change file
5) Use a clean piece of silicon (be careful not to touch the surface with your hand) into the  spin coater . Pour the vacuum-filled CI-PDMS mixed glue on it (note the amount of control).
6) After the silicone is finished, place the silicon wafer on the foil paper, put it into a 60 ° C heating box, and heat it for 1 hour.

Youth rep workshop on United Nations SDGs
The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are projects created by the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) and comprises a call to action to achieve 17 goals by 2030 ( SDG Website ). These goals can be achieved by governments, the private sector, the civil sector or individual citizens and will be funded by the UNDP.
On 17th September the UN youth representatives of Switzerland have organized a workshop with various youth organizations of Switzerland, including Zurich Model United Nations (MUN), Young European Swiss (YES), Youth Party representatives, iGEM ETH Zurich and many more. The goal was to present the SDGs, listen speakers of current SDG related projects already started in Europe. Afterwards, teams were created to determine how our organization can work with other youth representatives to achieve these goals.
It quickly became apparent that iGEM and the different projects it has spawned since its creation have the potential to help achieve multiple goals:
Goal 1: No Hunger
Goal 3: Good Health
Goal 4: Quality Education
Goal 5: Clean Water and Sanitation
Goal 7: Renewable energy
Goal 9: Innovation and Infrastructure
Goal 14: Life on Land
The competition itself touches on the “Quality Education” goal with its Human Practices component. Our Pavlov’s Coli project and other diagnostics/therapeutics track projects attempt to achieve goal 3. In general, iGEM can show great synergy with the SDGs and we strongly encourage future iGEM teams to collaborate with recognized NGOs (Non-Governmental Organizations) related to achieve SDGs.
Additionally, we collaborated with Zurich MUN and the YES to focus together on goal 4 (Quality Education) and 17 (Partnership for the Goals). Our plan is to organize an event with the motto “Inform, Motivate, Engage!” Given that our common interests are educating people on our subjects, we want to get more people engaged in their subjects. To achieve this we would introduce them to three levels of engagement: Global, Regional and Local.
These also represent the levels at which our projects act: MUN is engaged globally, YES on the European regional level and iGEM teams through"
Aachen,2014,Team:Aachen#Notebook#Software#Measurarty_-_-_TEXT.html,"ness index). Due to the merging step in our C++-SRM algorithm implementation, our code has to do  $O(x^2 \cdot y^2)$ comparisons, which then finally results in a runtime complexity of $O( x^2 \cdot y^2)$.
Pixel count of the detected pathogenic region versus time after induction.
From the above figure it can also be seen that the detected amount of pathogenic-area correlates with time after induction. The lag-phase can be explained first by the lag-phase of the cells, which first need to generate a response to the pathogen, and on the other hand, by too low fluorescence which is not detectable. The pixel count also meets the expectation when looking at the sample files by eye.
Detecting P. aeroginosa with K131026
The left half shows the original images from the device and the right half shows the same pictures with the detected pathogenic region analyzed by Measurarty.
It can be concluded that the Measurarty pipeline defines a robustly working chip-analysis algorithm which can detect pathogens from images supplied by WatsOn. Therefore, this algorithm closes the gap between our biology, detection hardware and the user who wants easy-to-interpret results.
For future prospects, it would be interesting to do a proper performance analysis on our code, to find hotspots and optimize the code. Many for-loops leave plenty of room for vectorization and loop-unrolling. Parallelization, specifically with respect to embedded hardware such as the Raspberry Pi or Odroid U3, is limited to the extend that the overhead created would probably eliminate the improvements.

Measuarty is the image analysis logic behind our project. It has been prototyped and developed in MATLAB , and only later been ported into our WatsOn GUI.

During the winter holiday，we were honored to attend a trial on environment issue and got acquainted with Mr. Licheng Lin, a lawyer from Dacheng Law Office in Beijing. We introduced our project to him and raised several legal questions concerning environmental protection, then he invited us to visit his office and answered our questions with great patience. Mr.Lin’s reply enabled us to have a deeper understanding of legal provisions about environment protection, and we really appreciate his support and help.
Dialogue
1. Has China promulgated any laws related to the plastic pollution currently?
No. Now we only have the Environmental Protection Law of the People''s Republic of China, which came into official enforcement as of January 1, 2015. It is the cardinal law for environmental protection in China. This Law is formulated for the purpose of protecting and improving people's environment and the ecological environment, preventing and controlling pollution and other public hazards, safeguarding human health and facilitating the development of socialist modernization. It shows that our nation shall encourage the development of education in the science of environmental protection, aim to strengthen the study and development of the science and technology of environmental protection, and raise the scientific and technological level of environmental protection and popularize scientific knowledge of environmental protection.
2. What result has been achieved by enforcing relevant laws and regulations?
With the introduction and enforcement of the environmental protection law, our citizens' consciousness of environmental protection has gradually enhanced and deepened, contributing to the improvement in our environment."
Nevada,2011,Team:Nevada#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," glucose to feed E. coli. While it is possible to grow E. coli and cyanobacteria in the same culture vessel (Niederholtmeyer et al., 2010) Applied and Environmental Microbiology 76: 3462-3466), the photosynthetic efficiency of the system will be limited by light blockage caused by E. coli. For this reason, we have developed an apparatus that physically partitions the two bacterial species from each other, while still allowing for the free exchange of growth medium. In this way, we can ensure high photosynthetic rates for Synechocystis and total accessibility by E. coli to the cyanobacterial produced glucose.
Choice of Growth Medium
      BG-11 must be used for culturing Synechocystis.  However, this medium does not provide adequate nourishment to E. coli.  Thus, this project must determine what additives to BG-11 will foster growth of both organisms.  The supplemented media must allow for growth of E. coli comparable to LB but must not inhibit Synechocystis with toxic levels of solutes.
      Initial tests will determine if BG-11 has an inherently sufficient nitrogen supply for E. coli.  Previous research has shown that NH4+ is more effective than nitrates and nitrites when used by E. coli as a nitrogen source (Strevett, K.A., and Chen, G., 2003).  Therefor, testing will be done with the growth of NEB 10-ß cells in BG-11 with NH4Cl as an additional source of nitrogen.  The growth in this media will be compared with that of BG-11 alone.  It must then be shown that Synechocystis PCC6803 can tolerate the levels of ammonium chloride required.  If ammonium chloride cannot be used, nitrites and nitrates may then be used as a backup option.
      Once a source of nitrogen has been found, experiments will be done to find a standard curve.  This curve will give us a baseline we can compare with when determining if our E. coli is being successfully fed by glucose produced in cyanobacteria.  The ideal media will produce an optical density of 1.00, at 600 nm, after 24 hours.  When glucose is added to this media, we should see a greater extent of growth, giving a positive result for co-cultivation.

Construction of ODE equation
At our first step, we wanted to describe the system thoroughly without leaving out any seemingly unimportant actions and factors. As a result, the description of the system contains every possible mass actions as well as some hill kinetics, Henri-Michaelis-Menten. We came up a set of ODEs with 19 equations.
Figure 1 designed circuit of cell I
Figure 2 designed circuit of cell II
Promoter 1 and promoter 2 preceding lasR and luxR genes respectively are constant promoters, which will transcribe and translate into protein PlasR and PluxR. LA1 is the binding association of lasR and 30C12HSL(A2C1) and it can affect the subsequent promoter 2 which can be described by Hill Equation. The same goes to LA2. Gene luxI will be translated into protein PluxI which would generate 30C6HSL(A1C1) through enzymatic reaction. The AHL will diffuse through the membrane to the environment(A1e) and finally enter into Cell 2(A1C2). Protein PtetR which is translated from gene tetR represses promoter 5 which is responsible for transcription of gene lasI. Promoter 6 is constant for translation of protein PlasI. 30C12HSL(A2C2) is generated from Protein PlasI through enzymatic reaction. 30C12HSL in the environment is called A2e which will diffuse to Cell 1. aTc is added manipulatively to change the phase of oscillation by binding the protein PTetR. Therefore, we have these following ODEs:
Parameters
The parameters are inherent factors determining the behaviors, properties of a system. We selected the quantities thoughtfully from previous iGEM teams and some others were found from published papers.

To evaluate these parameters, we will fit the data created by the wet lab team. We allow a tolerance of a factor of ten either side of our initial guess for each parameter. The fitted parameters will be given in the fourth column and will be found using the MATLAB function fmincon. To solve the equations numerically we use the MATLAB equation solver ode15s. We plot three solutions for various parameters below.
Stochastic
A stochastic model is anything which includes some random element, and is useful for modeling small systems or those with some uncertainty. We produced a video tutorial on how to model gene expression networks stochastically using Gillespie's algorithm.[ 2 , 4 ].
Gillespie's Algorithm
Find random numbers \(r_{1}\) and \(r_{2}\) which are uniformly distributed between 0 and 1.
Find propensities \(\alpha_{i}\) of \(N\) possible reactions. Find \(\alpha_{0}=\sum\limits_{i=1}^N \alpha_{i}\).
Compute time \(\tau=\dfrac{1}{\alpha_{0}}\ln\left(\dfrac{1}{r_{1}}\right)\"

The situation, however, is quite different from what we expected. We explained to them what the promoter is, but it was so hard for them to understand, not to mention completing a circuit. Since most of the students lacked related knowledge, few students attended this game. And those who attended this game required a lot of hints to finish the circuit.                           In terms of the “Project Sharing” part, we presented the project of 2014, FLAME. We demonstrated the function of our software. They also gave us some suggestions, one of the most impressive being:
The public are interested in the games.

“It’s awesome to generate a circuit automatically                        though I don’t know what exactly is a circuit.                        But what about finishing a circuit together?                        Say, working together?”
This remark did give us much inspiration: in this world full of competition and cooperation, why not make design a collaboration one? Via collaboration and co-development, we can even construct designs much more complex than we can ever imagine. (A good example is the sequencing of human genome, which was done by collaboration between several countries.)
Plus, most of our audiences have the same question:
“Does the simulation module accurate?”
Which is the one of the biggest challenges remaining unsolved.
2. Synbio Box: learn synthetic biology in a game.
“What are biological parts?
What are their functions?”
In the garden party, some one asked us these questions. It is difficult to explain to them, because they lack relevant knowledge on molecular biology. What if let them play a game and learn synthetic biology at the same time?
So we designed a game, Synbio Box, to help introduce synthetic biology to the public. Target players of this game is people who have not ever learned synthetic biology but have interested in it.                            We have promoted this game to other iGEM teams, to the public as well as to the freshmen. In the NCTU_Formosa meetup, meetup with high-school teams as well as the Peking CCiC meetup, we promoted this game to wet-lab teams, and they had great interest in this simple but enjoyable game.
The game is popular among WeChat. After trying on the game, some people gave us feedbacks. According to their feedbacks, we re-designed and improved the game. Now players can have more fun playing this game with the new game settings!                           For more details or if you want to download the game, please"

Background
TALEs: a powerful tool in synthetic biology
Transcriptor activator-like effectors (TALEs) are proteins produced by bacteria of the genus Xanthomonas and secreted into plant cells. These naturally occurring TALEs play a key role in bacterial infection, as they are responsible for upregulation of the host genes required for pathogenic growth and expansion (Mussolino & Cathomen, 2012). Recently, it was reported that another plant pathogen, Ralstonia solanacearum, produces type III effectors, which have a sequence similar to TALEs from Xanthomonas spp. These proteins were therefore named Ralstonia injected protein TALEs or RipTALEs (De Lange et al., 2013).
TALEs share some common features, such as an N-terminal type III secretion signal, which allows the proteins to be translocated from the bacterium and into the plant cell. They also present nuclear localization signals (NLS) and an acidic activation domain (AAD) in the C-terminus. The central region, also termed repeat region, mediates DNA recognition through tandem repeats of 33 to 35 amino acids residues each (Bogdanove et al., 2010). The binding domain usually comprises 15.5 to 19.5 single repeats (Figure 1). The last repeat, close to the C-terminus, is called “half-repeat” because it is only around 20 amino acids in length. Although the modules have conserved sequences, polymorphisms are found in residues 12 and 13, the “repeat-variable di-res"
Wageningen_UR,2017,Team:Wageningen UR#Safetytest_-_-_TEXT.html," that several residues will have to mutate to render a functional protein that does not need bipA. Multiply the slim chances that a single protein mutates for the three engineered proteins, and the chances of an escapee mutant are really low.
Protection from environmental supplementation: bipA is an artificial compound that will not be found in any natural ecosystem.
Resistance to horizontal gene transfer: The escape frequency will decrease as different auxotrophies are included. Moreover, the difference in the genetic code will help avoiding the horizontal gene transfer. For example, if an essential gene transferred contains the stop codon UAG, this will be translated into bipA and the gene will render an inactive protein.
The advantages and efficacy of this method make it the perfect for our chosen containment mechanism.
Figure 1: This figure explains basics of the chosen biocontainment system, synthetic auxotrophy. Its easy explanation makes it adequate for the general public. This figure was used next to the comic to inform the public about the safety of our project.
Risk Assessment
Risk assessment is the quantitative or qualitative estimation of the risk that a specific threat generates. Performing this analysis in synthetic biology can prove difficult, as there is no certain understanding on how synthetic organisms might affect the environment.
With the development of genetic engineering, a risk assessment protocol for GMOs was developed in 2008 [7] in which a case-by-case analysis of the trait inserted, the strain used, and a release in a specific environment should be performed. However, synthetic biology handles far more complex systems that just one insertion, which will interact among themselves in a way that might affect the cell and therefore, reduce the knowledge about the risk it possesses [1].
In an attempt to develop a more suitable protocol for the release of synthetic organisms in the environment, a group of synthetic biologists and ecologists met in the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars in Washington DC to discuss on how to assess the risks of synthetic biology [8]. They identified four points of risk research to evaluate the ecological impact of synthetic organisms:
Interaction between synthetic and natural organisms
In the case of a release in the environment, the differences in the physiology between natural and synthetic organisms will have an important impact on the environment. Furthermore, when a modified bacteria is released in the environment, its main competitor will be unmodified bacteria of the same species or similar ones. Therefore, it is important to compare the synthetic organisms with their unmodified parent strain: growth rate, toxic effects and growth requirements.
Effect of the synthetic organism on the environment
In case the modified bacteria finds a niche in the environment, it may interact with other organisms as well"

Collaboration with Synbio-tech
Synbio Tech is an innovator in the field of synthetic biology in China, having a wide range of cooperation with both international companies and universities. It aims to provide customers with a perfect technical platform of the synthetic biology. For now, by applying their unique self-established technical platform Syno? involving sound chip-based gene synthetic and high throughput gene sequencing service, it already develops the technology of constructing recombinant antibody libraries as well as highly-purified vaccines, genome synthesis and DNA storage.
As a major sponsor of XJTLU-China 2015, they provided a lab equipped with all apparatus and reagents needed and directly gave a hand in the de novo gene synthesis in the circuits’ construction. At the beginning of iGEM project, the company offered us a training program including both theoretical basis of synthetic biology and practical skills useful in later wet experiments. Also during the collaboration this summer, they were active in supervising our experiments and giving valuable suggestions on experiment protocols and result analysis.

The expression of human sweet taste receptor in yeast
In the sensing part, the G protein coupled receptor (GPCR) T1R2 and T1R3 were heterologously expressed in Saccharomyces Cerevisiae due to its ability to regulate a wide range of cellular processes such as the senses of taste and smell. Moreover, we constructed a mRFP-based assay to achieve proper detection of sweetness responses.
So we had to achieve two goals:
1. To express T1R2 and T1R3 in Saccharomyces Cerevisiae.
2. Construct a response signal circuit to confirm that our receptors can detect the sweeteners.
Results:
1. Synthesized the gene of human receptors T1R2 and T1R3
2. Expressed the heterologous GPCR in Saccharomyces Cerevisiae.
3. The engineered yeast with T1R2 and T1R3 can sense the sweeteners.
Details of the results:
1. The gene synthesis of T1R2 and T1R3
GPCR sequences are extracted from NCBI’s NR database. The sweet taste receptor T1R2-T1R3 (ID: 83756 and 80834) responds to diverse stimuli associated with the human sense of sweet taste, such as sucrose, d-tryptophan and aspartame. In reliable expression in Saccharomyces Cerevisiaei, we finished the codon optimization and reverse transcription of protein sequences into DNA sequences on the website http://54.235.254.95/gd/. The sequences of our receptors were established into the parts BBa_K2368003 and BBa_K2368004.
We synthesized the human receptor genes T1R2 and T1R3 using building block which based on overlapping-extension PCR. The PCR result was showed as Fig.9.
Fig. 9 The PCR result of synthetic genes T1R2 (2520 bp) and T1R3 (1989 bp).

So, we concluded that the solution could be a concentrated LB medium (10X)12,without heat treatment. This medium has a low percentage of free amino acids. By concentrating it, we can increase this percentage, allowing the metabolic pathways described above. The advantages of a complex medium over a chemically defined medium are the easiest and cheapest fabrication process, which is important to turn our device accessible to the society. Furthermore, as LB medium has different free components, allowing also the activation of pathways that trigger the germination of superdormant spores 12.

Tsinghua,2017,Team:Tsinghua-A#KillAbility_-_-_TEXT.html,"6. If the ratios are alike, then the killing ability of the warriors are similar.    Figure 2 shows the result.We can see that in the medium containing A+K, the amount of the warriors from two sides are roughly equal. At the same time, in the medium containing C, the amount of warrior 2 is much larger.This is easy to explain as not only does warrior 2 kills warrior 1, but warrior 1 kills itself as well.                                     *A+K stands for ampicilin+kanamycin,C stands for chloramphenicol.
IV.Results:
B.Test if the killing ability is adequate
   We calculate the ratio of beggar/warrior in each group and the results can be seen from the figures.
   We can see that when we mix warrior1 with beggar 2, the amount of beggar 2 after 15h is much more than the amount of warrior 1.This may partly because warrior1 kills itself and partly because its killing ability towards beggar 2 is weak.
   In contrast with the result above, we find that when we mix beggar1 and warrior 2 together, the amount of warrior2 surely surpasses that of beggar1. Besides, the killing ability of warrior2 is adequate. The killing ability is neither too strong                                                                      when the ratio is 1:1, nor is it too weak when the ratio is 1:10.
   Furthermore, we compared the amount of beggars when they are cultured alone with the amount of beggars when they are cultured with warriors. We calculated the amount of beggars in group 7/group 8 to see the change in beggar1 and in group11/group12 to see the change in beggar2.From  figure 4, we can see that the amount of beggar1 drops drastically when it is cultured with warrior2,                                                                which means that warrior2 really work. As the amount of beggar2 does not have an apparent change, we may say that warrior1’s killing ability is surely too weak.
       
V.Analysis:
    Firstly, we ensure that our warriors can really kill. The amount of beggars do decrease when the warriors from the other side is added and the more warriors, the less beggars.(figure 3) Secondly,we get to the conclusion that the killing ability of the two warriors are apparently not equal. The killing ability of warrior2 is actually quite ideal as it does not kill itself and that its killing ability towards beggar1 is obvious but not excessively strong. The killing ability of warrior1 is rather"

Calgary,2013,Team:Calgary#Sandbox#Notebook#Journal#Modeling_-_-_TEXT.html," to figure out how to simulate TALE binding to DNA, according to laws of physics. We were hoping for using the electrostatics plug-in and derive the reactions from Brownian motion, but I had no luck with any of these. In fact I doubt whatever Cesar understood the capability of Maya himself, for he too is learning about doing dynamics in Maya just as we are. Probably the ¡°quantitative modelling¡± he envisioned was due to wishful thinking, not based on the capabilities of Maya.
Justin did have made good progress with animating TALE binding to DNA without any physics. He did the most of the work of creating two animations while I rendered them into .avi files. Together we now understand the entire process from importing .pdb files to output animations to .avi files; we are ready for production.
For next week, after meeting with Cesar, we had agreed to focus on animation for now. The physics and details can be added later as we gain experience and insight with the molecules we working on.
Week 15: August 5 - August 9
Justin kept working on animating TALE binding to DNA, except this time he will also add ferritin, coils and linkers. The result is ferritin sphere + 12 TALE's + 24 coils and linkers + 1 DNA. Unfortunately the computer he is working on is not powerful enough to smoothly handle this, as a result of the slow response from the computer his progress has been slow. For me the work is to animate immobilized TALE binding to DNA. The difficulty lies in finding out how TALE should deform such that it can bind to DNA while one end of it is immobilized. For this Justin and I actually spend some time playing with wires that represent TALE and DNA to figure out the proper motion. Moreover Maya just behaves oddly on our computers; sometimes we can't generate DNA using the ePMV plug-in, sometimes the button on Maya's shelf will disappear. As a result we accumulated lots of technical questions that we were hoping to be addressed.
To this end we wished that Cesar would be of help, but our meeting was not of substance. Cesar avoided all of our technical questions; instead he spends lots of time reminding us of the big pictures and the approach he would like to see. He actually advised us to abandon the way we had been doing animation, which is by key framing, and switch to Nucleus engine. Given that the animation we tries to build are already complicated for us to handle (protein folding and interactions), we doubt that the computer can solve on its own"

We studied about part's prefix and suffix and how to assemble it. We went further to find out what an RBS is, and studied glossaries and composition of them. Then we asked concepts we didn't understand to advisors.
2/21 - Q & A session
Today’s meeting was canceled due to an unexpected problem with school’s Wi-Fi. We therefore had a question-and-answer session.
The questions were:
Aligned space.
Orthogonal RBS
Meaning of 'various purposes of origin of replication'.
2/23 - Groups formed
We finished studying the 'Help' section of registry.
What we learned and did:
Termination, rho-dependent/independent pathway, types of RNA polymerase.
Design, components, construction, efficiency of terminator.
There are forward, reverse, and bidirectional terminators.
How to differentiate between natural parts and synthesized parts using barcode.
Parts symbols.
Read dissertations related to the above topics.

TU_Darmstadt,2014,Team:TU Darmstadt#Team#Members_-_-_TEXT.html,"stadt for my bachelor's degree in computer science and my master's degree in physics.
I initially learned about iGEM during my bachelor thesis at the Computational Biology and Simulation group.
As physicist and computer scientist I am equipped with a relatively broad theoretical knowledge from which I want to contribute to the Team, e.g., in the field of modeling.For me personally iGEM is a chance to work with a large Team, in comparison to the group sizes common for my field of study, on an interesting and multidisciplinary subject. Thus, through iGEM I can broaden my scope of knowledge and learn new team competences.

Study: B.Sc. Biotechnology
I pay attention on iGEM because of a documantation of syntetic biology which aroused my interest.The more I informed me, the more I wanted to take a part of it.By chance I met the right person and I could not miss this opportunity.Now i am glad to transform the theory of lectures into practice to collect important experiences

The contest offers the unique opportunity to carry out research in a practically oriented manner and to meet scientific challenges as a team. Therefore, iGEM presents an outstanding occasion to gain new valuable experiences and to further develop my personal and scientific skills.  
I hope that we as a project team will be successful in finding solid solutions to the problems we will be confronted with and I am highly motivated to make my personal contribution to iGEM.

Age: 25 
Subject: M.Sc Technical Biology, 2. semester 
I took part in the first iGEM participation of the TU Darmstadt two years ago and I am looking forward to another challenging year of participating in the competition. I like working with students from multiple disciplines and the freedom and opportunity to try out diverse ideas in the lab. The fascinating projects that are performed every year give an impression of how much knowledge a student can gain by competing at iGEM. I specialized on computational biology during my bachelor studies and I am looking forward to employing those skills for my team.
