Conclusion
Non-small cell lung cancer, or NSCLC, is an aggressive cancer. It grows in the lumen of the organ at high speed. This localization is highly correlated to the localization of factors launching the tumorgenesis (contained in the tobacco smoke for example). Tumor cells lose their apoptotic capacity after the functional loss of different tumor suppressors playing a role in the apoptotic pathway. The DVS application in the fight against cancer is based on the fact to reactivate these apoptotic pathway by bringing into tumor cells a wild-type version of genes coding for an healthy version of a non-functional  tumor suppressor gene. The COSMIC project of Sanger institute allows us to inventory genes the most likely to be mutated in the case of lung cancer. So, we had to determine the therapeutic plasmid composition applied to this physiopathology.
Several studies showed that lung is one of the Mycobactérium avium natural tropism in mouse and Human. After an intravenous injection of M. avium, the tissue vector gets to the lung and can grow inside it. So, the first DVS concept, for these application, is validated.  For the second one, literature shows that the creation of a recombined phage with an adenovirus penton base , a protein which allows to pass through membranes by endocytosis, is possible. The cell vector creation, which has for objective to integer the therapeutic plasmid into eukaryotic tumor cells, is feasible. It is proved that we can modulate the efficiency of the interaction of the penton base with integrins of eukaryotic cells by using the whole protein or only its RGD sequence alone. In the DVS project context it is the entire structure of the protein that we placed on the Lambda phage capsid. Possessing a lower affinity for cell than if we used the RGD motif alone, cell vectors could more  scatter and consequently, touch a higher number of cells.
In vivo studies on human proved that to bring a wild-type version of a tumor suppressor gene into tumor"

SJTU-BioX-Shanghai,2015,Team:SJTU-BioX-Shanghai#Public Acceptance_-_-_TEXT.html," to make the water shortage report as a map on the basis of available data in China to make understand the public in easy way . Also, the maps will help to identify the most severe water shortage area in China. With the maps, we want the public to understand the reason behind our water shortage problem. It might not seems related to our project but this will help pushing to find the solution for other water shortage problem, such as water recycling.
Figure  6.5.3 2013 Per Capita Water Resources in China
Data resource: National Bureau of Statistics of China
Figure  6.5.4 2013 Per Capita Water Consumption in China
Data resource: National Bureau of Statistics of China
Generally speaking, China is now facing severe water problem, which is mainly about the lack of clean fresh water. Although China’s total water resource is temporarily abundant, whose quantity is about 2.8 trillion cubic meters, ranking the forth in the world. Water resources per capita equals to only one quarter of the world’s average (Li, S, 2009). From figure 6.5.3 and 6.5.4,  water problem is the especially serious in Northwest China and North China.
Reasons of water shortage in China
China’s water problem results from multiple reasons. The reasons can be divided in two parts, uncontrollable reasons and controllable reasons.
Uncontrollable reasons, including hydro-geological condition, rainfall capacity, and demand growth caused by population growth, are difficult to be changed by human beings.
Some areas are located in arid or semi-arid region, such as Northwest China, so annual total rainfall is very little. Especially in Sinkiang, annual total rainfall in 2013 is only 303. 6 billion cubic meters (Department of Water Resources of Sinkiang, 2014). What’s more, awful hydro-geological condition makes surface and shallow subsurface of some area lack water storage space. Even though water resources is abundant in flood season because of heavy rainfall in a short time, most of water will go rushing out in the form of flood. Therefore, water resources shortage won’t be alleviated after flood season (Tan, H, 2013).
Demand growth caused by population growth is also a reason of more and more serious water resources shortage. Although the population of China is under effective control, positive natural population growth rate means that the population is growing continuously. If we suppose China’s total water resources is almost invariant, per capita water resource is less and less.
Compared with uncontrollable reasons, controllable part should be"

√  Our project has implications for the iPSCs application in regenerate medicine field. Actually our design itself is a novel approach we used to minimize the potential tumorigenicity risks of iPSCs and accelerate the development of moving iPSC-based therapies to the patient bedside. Synthetic biological technique helps us to set up an accurate and controllable model of our design. What’s more, with the mature tet-off system we used, in the future it’s even possible that patients could get a healthier and safer liver derived from their own iPSCs without taking any medicine in the long term.
Experimental achievements
√  Via transient transfection experiments, we successfully proved that each parts of our design (suicide gene, tet-off system and miR122 target) work as expected in both hepatma cell lines and 293T cell lines.
√  Via stable transfection with lentivirus, we successfully established several cell lines (Hep G2, HTC and mouse iPSC) stably expressing our device.
√  Successfully generated Oct4-GFP iPSCs, which harbor an IRES-EGFP fusion cassette downstream of the stop codon of the Oct4 (Pou5f1) gene.
√  Successfully proved that our suicide genes part worked in stable expression mouse iPSC lines.
√  Successfully isolated and cultured the primary hepatocytes from mice. Because hepatocyte is very hard to both transiently and stably tranfect (at only 10% efficiency), we are still trying to improve the transfection efficiency.
√  Trying to inject the mouse stable iPSCs containing our device into nude mice and wait for the in vivo result.

We tested the cell extract for laccase activity by filling each well with 140 µL cell extract, 40 µL buffer, 18 µL H2O and added 2 µL ABTS. Unfortunately no activity was seen. We felt like we could not take the laziness of our laccases. We thought and discussed what the reason could be for them to be inactive.

Stanford,2018,Team:Stanford-Brown-RISD#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," this experiment, N-acetyl D-glucosamine (“NaDg”; analogous to a chitin monomer and widely used in the literature for assessing chitin binding) was first titrated into 2x-HHTC-Re-CBD and no isotherm was calculated because binding sites were not saturated by the ligand. Cu was then titrated into the 2x-HHTC-Re-CBD + NaDg complex and this resulted in a Cu affinity at Ka= 7.61 +/- 1.49x 106 M-1 that is largely comparable to 2x-HHTC-Re (no CBD) and lowerby an order of magnitude than 2x-HHTC-Re-CBD without bound NaDg. Data show 20 1 µL injections. 2x-HHTC-Re-CBD was selected as the candidate for testing because it displayed the most consistent and strong results during protein purification procedures, and seemed most promising for downstream applications (such as our filter). Work is in progress on optimizing the 3x and 6x fusion proteins and creating prototypes (thus far, protein production as been successful).
Figure 5: Isotherm and data produced by ITC for assessing the binding affinity of our fusion protein (2x-HHTC-Re-CBD) for chitin (represented by N-acetyl D-glucosamine) and Cu.
Tangential Flow Prototype Creation: Material Properties and Design Considerations
The first consideration when thinking about creating a mycelium biofilter had to do with the qualities and characteristics of the mycelium material. Would it be waxy? Would the chitin be exposed? Such questions and more could significantly impact the approach we picked for functionalizing any material produced. The first test we did was comprised of a simple dye being poured on a piece of mycelium to observe the hydrophobicity of the material and whether it could be easily penetrated (as seen in the video below).
It is evident that the mycelium surface is highly hydrophobic. While this may appear to be an undesirable trait for a water filter, we found that subsequent incubation of mycelium in moving water for a period of 48 hours allowed for the material to become permeable. In an interesting twist of synergy, the fusion protein we were attempting to produce was highly hydrophobic as well, and therefore probably showed good affinity for the mycelium material (Figure 6).

NAU-CHINA
On July 31, 2018, at the 6th Asia-Pacific iGEM Conference hosted by National Chung Hsing University, Taichung，we met with NAU-CHINA team and established a deep friendship. Since then, our two teams have exchanged and discussed ""how to build a team.""
The professor affirmed the feasibility of our project and gave us some invaluable advice. Under the suggestion of Professor Zhu Zhi, we chose EpCAM and aptamer SYL3C. In addition, we are very grateful to Professor Zhu for her support on many instruments and materials provided during our experiments.
First we discussed ""what kind of team should we build?"" The International Genetic Engineering Machine Competition is a creative synthetic biology event and an interdisciplinary competition involving cross-disciplinary fields in mathematics, computers, statistics and so on. So our team should be a creative, comprehensive synthetic biology team. Our team members should be creative and comprehensive students. Most students of our two teams have multiple roles in the team.
Second, we discussed ""how to find new partners."" After we know what kind of team we want to build, we could find the companions we need. First, we have presentations, exhibitions, lab activities, etc. to make students realize that, what kind of the team they will join in and what is the team building for? what role they will be in the team, and what should be done by themselves? In order to join this team and make this team better, how should them prepare and learn? Then we divide the interviewers into different groups according to different division of labor and their wishes. Different groups determine the way of assessment according to the division of labor. For example, the number module is tested by some models, and the art team performs preliminary selection through some art production tasks... We will give priority to students with multiple skills.
Third, we communicated on how to train the new team members in the early stages of team formation. First of all, we will introduce our team and International Genetic Engineering Machine Competition through"

BDSF-Induced Phosphorylation of BCAM0228[P] Mediates GFP Expression
BCAM0228 is Phosphorylated by Unknown Compound
Conclusion
Objectives
To investigate why GFP expression was high in the absence of signal in our engineered BDSF system.
BDSF-Induced Phosphorylation of BCAM0228[P] Mediates GFP Expression
We constructed models1 similar to those used in the PQS system to investigate the signal-response behaviour of the BDSF system. Using the parameters defined in table 1, our results2,3 verified what we had expected to happen. Phosphorylation of BCAM0228 is induced by BDSF binding to a cell receptor.   BCAM0228[P] then activated the expression of GFP through the engineered cbld promoter. In the absence of a BDSF signal, BCAM0228 remained in its unphosphorylated form and GFP expression was repressed.  Increasing the signal induced an increased GFP response (Fig 1).
BCAM0228 is Phosphorylated by Unknown Compound
Our experimental results revealed that in the absence of BDSF, the cblD promoter was active in our engineered system and hence GFP expression upregulated.
From our system of equations we know that the expression of GFP is dependant on the levels of BCAM0228[P]. We hypothesised"
Northwestern,2014,Team:Northwestern#Growth_-_-_TEXT.html," samples from Lake Michigan from Northwestern's lakefill provided two additional environmental strains. Characterization of these strains were done in the same cell free platform. The two strains collected were Comammonas testostrene and Enterobacter aerogenes. Comammonas testostrene is a strain of bacterium that plays a big role in bioaugmentation. Characterization of this strain could significantly expedite the process of biowaste degradation in the near future. Successful characterization of our part in these different lysates would also prove that our platform can be universally utilized.

Metabolic Engineering Design:
Analysis of metabolic pathways helped us decide what approach was best to engineer an organism to produce erythritol. While some organisms were shown to produce erythritol naturally, we mainly aimed to find one that naturally produced a precursor, erythrose-4-phosphate (E4P). E4P is produced in many bacteria in the pentose phosphate pathway.
Previous attempts to complete this engineering in other organisms showed at least two necessary genes were needed to convert erythrose 4 phosphate to erythritol. An enzyme was needed to remove a phosphate and convert the molecule to erythrose. For this we used TM1254, an erythrose-4-phosphate phosphatase, isolated from the thermophile Thermotoga maritima MSB8. GLD1, an erythrose reductase, isolated from the filamentous fungi Trichoderma reesei, was then used to complete the final reaction in our pathway to erythritol.
Visual representation of the gene construct designed to engineer the Erythrose reductase pathway into B. subtilis. Pylb is the promoter. TM1254 and GLD1 are the genes required to complete the Erythrose reductase pathway and produce erythritol.
It was important to consider energetic favorability in the genetic engineering of our metabolic pathway. This played a role in the balancing of chemical resources within the cell between pathways that promote cell proliferation or viability and those that made erythritol production. Majority of reactions to produce erythrose-4-phosphate in the cell use fructose-6-phosphate as a key reactant. Fructose-6-phosphate also serves as a primary reactant in glycolysis, one of the metabolic pathways necessary for cell survival. By driving the conversion of E4P → erythritol, we worried that during exponential growth stage, we would create a ‘carbon sink’, causing continuous over-consumption of available fructose-6-phosphate, and as a result reducing available reactants for the glycolytic pathway. This could potentially result in cell death or low erythritol yield. To account for this, we aimed to engineer a method that yielded minimal production of our enzymes during exponential growth yet strong upregulation during"

Methods
We ordered the nodC gene via IDT sequencing and inserted this gene into the pSB1C3 vector via the BioBrick system and verified this via sequencing.
One pSB1C3 vector has an AraC promoter system (BBa_K808000) and the other an Anderson promoter with defined cleavage sites (BBa_K2380025) . Both vectors have the RBS BBa_K2380024 .

Figure 6. Plasmidcard of NodC with Anderson promoter. The nodC gene (in pink) is located on the pSB1C3 vector with an Anderson promoter (red) and a RBS (grey). This part is used for expression studies without the necessity of an induction. BioBrick (BB) suffix and prefix are shown in light blue. (BBa_K2380001) .

Afterwards we transformed the vector in E. coli BL21 for expression studies and started the expression, once by induction with 100 µL arabinose for the AraC promoter system and the other without induction by the constitutive Anderson promoter. To examine the successful expression, an SDS-PAGE was done.
The next step was the purification of the protein and the verification of the enzyme function. To purify the enzyme, a site-directed mutagenesis was done at the C-Terminus to add a His-tag and the protein was purified via an ÄKTA in combination with a 1 mL HisTrap column by GE Healthcare.  The activity of the NodC enzyme was evaluated via two different assays.

UNebraska-Lincoln,2017,Team:UNebraska-Lincoln#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," them suggestions on how they could solve their problem. Methungeny’s project aim is to develop a methane biosensor medium which consists of methane-utilizing bacteria and an enzymatic assay. When methane is present in the environment of the bacteria, they will produce lactate which will be converted to a colorful substance by the assay kit. The bacterium they chose to perform the methane to lactate conversion is the Methylococcus capsulatus. Normally, it does not produce lactate and that's why they are going to insert a gene of the lactate-dehydrogenase (LDH) enzyme in it, which is able to transform pyruvate to lactate. Since this bacterium is a thermotolerant organism, they thought it would be worth using the LDH of another thermotolerant bacterium, so the LDH gene is originated from Bacillus coagulans. They will put this gene into a vector designed especially for Methylococcus capsulatus, but at this point they faced an issue.
They were searching for an appropriate constitutive promoter which would be able to drive the LDH gene, but they had not found an exact promoter sequence. They asked us if we could help them find a promoter which could be used in Methylococcus capsulatus. The UNebraska-Lincoln iGEM team did some research and gave them some suggestions on which promoter they could use. We suggested that Methylococcus capsulatus's primary sigma factor for exponential growth (RpoD) is very similar to E. coli's RpoD, especially the DNA binding region. So we believe an Anderson promoter will be sufficient for their purpose. In the spirit of iGEM, we sent them a link to Anderson promoters already cataloged in the registry: http://parts.igem.org/Promoters/Catalog/Anderson.
In return, they helped us with our safety page section. Our team has designed a new idea called safety cases to help with safety in the iGEM world. We asked them for help critiquing our explanation of the safety cases and also our general safety information. They promptly responded with many helpful suggestions seen below.
“We missed a ""Safety measures in a molecular biology laboratory"" part what describes the biosafety dress code (the need of wearing gloves, goggles, lab coats etc.).  In our opinion, it would be also essential to mention the separate collection of disposable materials (e.g.: pipette tips, Eppendorf tubes and inoculating loops connecting with microorganisms).

Four attempts were made at producing the most photogenic electrophoresis gel to present our digested parts to the world with pride.
It is one thing to run a gel for a screening, it is an art to create one which is both accurate and appealing.
We set up one more set of cultures in the gas collecting apparatus. Continued to collect data and took a sample of gas.
Again, we compared the weight of the gas with that of air and hydrogen.
We also did another barium hydroxide reaction to determine how much CO2 was present.
Displacement was measured for each set up then it was time to analyse.
Finalising the collaboration work for NTU Singapore, we did an electrophoretic mobility shift assay testing their dCAS9 mutants.
After weeks of waiting we finally received a delivery of cytochrome c so there was a mad scramble to do an assay to demonstrate the activity of Fer.
Hanging up the lab coat marked a brief moment of reflection then someone reminded us about the looming wiki deadline and everyone dived head first into their computers.
The End.

According to research, in 2015, about 7 in 10 adults suffer the problem of being overweight or even being obese, and it is predicted that this problem will become apparent in more adults in the near future. One of the major factors that leads to obesity is “sugar”, which is found in beverages, desserts, and almost any kind of food. Thus, it is quite difficult not to absorb an excessive amount of sugar in our daily lives. In the hopes of preventing our bodies from absorbing too much glucose, our team aims to engineer bacteria that absorbs glucose more efficiently. Our team constructed active glucose transporters on the membrane of E.coli, enabling the glucose uptake to become faster than intestine cells. On the other hand, our team has designed a suicide circuit ensuring the bacteria won’t absorb all the sugar so that the body can get an adequate amount of sugar.

To understand what doubt people will react when seeing our product and to increase the extent of public acceptance, we invited The Mingdao Voice, an outstanding club for thinking and discussing. We introduced our project to them during the club time in the hope of getting inspiring feedback. 
 
 
The Mingdao Voice is a club organized by students themselves in Mingdao High School. Students there follow social issue with interest and hold lots of lectures, sharing thoughts with audiences. Quite unique this club is. 
 
This is the first time Mingdao iGEM jumps out of the field of science and collaborate with the elite in humanities and social science. The way they think against the holistic issue and the speech hitting the nail on the head made us realize more about the further influence our product will bring to the world if released. 
The followings are what we discussed with The Mingdao Voice :
Research has indicated that there will be a subtle decline in weight by reducing sugar intake in daily diet. The study lasted for about 8 months. The average decline on weight is about 1.7 bounds. Participants who consumed more sugar gain not much weight than those didn’t. 
“There is also evidence that the longer the study, the more striking the effect.” said researcher Jim Mann, DM, PhD, professor of human nutrition and medicine at the University of Otago. 
But, there’s no correspondence between sugar intake and changes on weight found on children. That may be owing"

Adaptor: Sarcosine Oxidase

Rationale and Aim
Glyphosate is a herbicide that works by blocking the activity of the enzyme enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase (EPSPS), which converts carbohydrates derived from glycolysis and the pentose phosphate pathway to plant metabolites and aromatic amino acids. We attempted to design a system capable of glyphosate detection. With little information regarding mechanisms of glyphosate interactions within the cell, we could not identify a simple system in which a responsive transcription factor was able to affect the production of a reporter gene. This is a common issue in many biosensor projects. The mining of transcriptome data has previously been used to find responsive DNA elements to a molecule of interest (Groningen 2012). Therefore, we analysed differences in transcriptome data between glyphosate sensitive and insensitive plants. A number of genes were found which were differently expressed. However, it was determined that it is more likely that this differential expression was not due to glyphosate directly, but rather the aromatic amino acid starvation caused by EPSPS inhibition by glyphosate, making these systems unsuitable for direct glyphosate detection. Various other systems we designed were also far from ideal, with high levels of complexity and reliance on native plant machinery. Through conversations with biosensor developers, we found that this problem was common in biosensor development - large amounts of often unavailable data is required for system design. For the Sensynova framework, we needed a more generic solution to this issue. Therefore, we expanded our search to look for biochemical reactions which we could monitor instead. This resulted in our concept of “adaptor” devices which can biochemically convert a difficult to sense molecule into a molecule for which there is already a genetic sensing component.
Background Information
Sarcosine Oxidase (SOX) is an enzyme that oxidatively demethylates sarcosine to form glycine, hydrogen peroxide and formaldehyde (Figure 1) (Trickey et al. 1999). SOX was selected to be an example of a possible solution to one of the 5 problems in biosensor production that we identified - unconventional substrates. We defined an unconventional substrate as a substrate that we have little prior knowledge of but that can be adapted into something with an existing biosensor. SOX was specifically chosen to demonstrate"

""Strategieprozess Biotechnologie 2020+"", Berlin, Germany
We were invited by the German Ministry of Education and Research to attend a national biotechnology conference and present a project poster in June 2012 in Berlin, Germany, along with the other 10 German iGEM teams. During the conference, we made good use of the opportunity to network with other iGEM teams and discussed collaborations, coordinated human outreach projects and general research topics in a separate iGEM session. Our SynBio Info Day (see below) is one of the results of our deliberations.

BostonU,2016,Team:BostonU HW#HP#Gold_-_-_TEXT.html," successful, long term open source project. By integrating our software, with all its documentation and supporting educational material, to NONA, we have provided Neptune a community and a platform for long term sustainability.
SEE OUR WORK WITH NONA
NONA and the iGEM Community
We mentioned that our team could give NONA a hand. Indeed, Neptune is the first iGEM project to be placed on NONA, and in our discussions with NONA we found that our team could pave the way for future iGEM teams that want to have a place for their software tools.
The Problem: iGEM software tools get lost
Each year, software solutions to synthetic biology problems are generated from teams around the world. iGEM software tools are especially prone to losing support or community after they are developed, as teams that developed those tools for the competition often find it hard to maintain those projects in the years thereafter. And worse yet, there have been dozens of software tools to come from iGEM, and none of these tools have a clear or coherent locations where they can be found.
The Solution: NONA to protect iGEM software tools
Our team offers itself as a point of contact for NONA at the iGEM Giant Jamboree this year. We want to extend the hand to other iGEM teams that have developed amazing tools, but are worried about how these tools will be maintained in the future. We will have an active NONA “about” booth at our Jamboree table, where we will provide information about what NONA is, how NONA can help iGEM teams with software, and information about how these teams can contribute their tools to NONA. We will also actively help these teams contact NONA and we’ll give them information on how to properly send their tools to NONA, expediting the integration process.
We are very excited that Neptune is now part of the NONA software tool platform. We are even more excited about the incredibly potential of integrating iGEM software tools with NONA. We envision a future where iGEM is integrated with NONA such that NONA has an entire section dedicated to tools developed by iGEM teams. This would be a huge way to make software tools in synthetic biology more integrated, well documented, coherently located and above all, accessible."

1.Would any of your project ideas raise safety issues in terms of:
researcher safety,
There are no hazardous chemicals that we used in the laboratory except for EtBr that we used in a special room for gel visualization and some buffers used in commercially available kits.
public safety, or
Since all the organisms used in the wetlab are destroyed after they are done working with they pose no danger for public safety. We use E.coli strain DH5alpha which is easy to kill and all the student members who work in the wetlab are very well trained to make sure there is no unwanted contamination. This year we are also working on a kill switch which, if works properly, will eliminate any bacteria whereas they will not be able to survive without IPTG present.
environmental safety?
As mentioned above a kill switch will be available in the organism which will initiate cell death when the cell is in an environment that does not contain enough IPTG.
2. Do any of the new BioBrick parts (or devices) that you made this year raise any safety issues?
We have followed all the safety procedures during the isolation process from the cells we had and we successfully isolated the DNA without any problems that will raise safety issues.
3.Is there a local biosafety group, committee, or review board at your institution?
If yes, what does your local biosafety group think about your project?
If no, which specific biosafety rules or guidelines do you have to consider in your country?
In our university we have a biosafety and ethical research center which monitors the safety of our projects. http://www.ueam.metu.edu.tr The members of METU Biology department are also members of National Biosafety Coordinating Committee. We are able to consult to them whenever it is necessary. Also biosafety is a very important subject for METU Department of Biology, whereas the student members are very well trained in the subject. Also the projects that we decided to work on are presented to many people in the area in order to see if they are of any concern for the biosafety regulations. All the"
Newcastle,2017,Team:Newcastle#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," digested with XbaI and PstI with expected band sizes of (2840 bp and 2044 bp).  The pSB1C3 plasmid (Lane 2) containing sfGFP as a control was also digested with XbaI and PstI with expected band sizes of (811 bp and 2044 bp).
The Fim switch insert is 2882 bp in length which makes performing standard short sequencing reads challenging as multiple reactions are required to completely sequence the entire part.  To overcome this we used our in-house Illumina MiSeq to completely sequence the entire plasmid.  Following quality control analysis the sequence was assembled and shown to be a match to the expected Fim switch part.
A problem we found with the Fim switch was that a subset of the colonies were prematurely switching from red to white.  This is likely due to a low level of leaky expression of the fimE gene which then inverts the promoter region upstream of the eforRed gene.  A single white colony was picked and cultured for use in downstream testing as a control as the switching of the promoter should express the rhlI gene and therefor produce the C4 quorum sensing molecule.
Characterisation
To test the functionality of the Fim switch, ensuring that C4 AHL is produced, the strain was cultured with a reporter strain ( K2205015 ) which produces GFP in response to the quorum sensing molecule C4 AHL.  Due to a small sub-population of the Fim switch strain being white, a single white colony was picked and cultured separately.  This strain was used as a positive control as it should produce C4 AHL.  Both the majority (red) Fim switch strains and minority flipped (white) Fim switch strains were tested for C4 AHL production by co-culture with the reporter strain.  Initially the Fim switch strains were spotted onto a lawn of the reporter strain (Figure 5) followed by quantitative analysis of the strains by co-culture in a 96 well microplate (Figure 6).    This culture is then co-cultured with the reporter cell. This reporter cell detects C4 AHL and expresses GFP in response.

UCL,2016,Team:UCL#Gut_-_-_TEXT.html,"1). We found greater strength in this argument when we were shown data from research undertaken at Imperial University showing oxidative stress to have a detrimental impact upon protein stability. The consequence of this is in turn reflected in protein activity and hence ageing. A description of these results is included below.
We have been researching the link between protein aggregation and oxidative stress. By using Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS), we were able to see that the size of a protein (monoclonal antibody) changed in the presence of oxidative stress. Under oxidative stress the protein becomes unstable and either undergoes a conformational change forming an unstable intermediate with a radius of a bit more than 1nm (as seen in image 2), or it aggregates (seen as the 2nd peak (at ~100-1000nm of the 2nd picture). 5mM of Hydrogen Peroxide was used to induce oxidative stress.
Particle Size Distribution without Oxidative Stress
 
Particle Size Distribution with Oxidative Stress
 
We also did some experimentation using Self-Interaction Chromatography (SIC) (data not shown). Without oxidative stress we get a nice peak and the area under the peak can be used to calculate the 2nd Osmotic Virial Coefficient (B2). B2 is a dimensionless no. that indicates protein stability. A positive B2 means that the proteins particles repel each other and will tend not to aggregate, but a negative B2 means that the protein is unstable, as its particles have a net attractive interaction and will aggregate. Without oxidative stress, the protein is stable with a B2 of 0.66.
However,  when the same protein is exposed to oxidative stress we have a negative B2 value of -21 meaning that the protein is very unstable. This is because oxidative stress causes particle-particle interaction to become very high and very attractive. This means that the  particles begin to take more and more time interacting with each other and the column attracts the mAb and heavily disrupts the flow of it.
In conclusion, oxidative stress has a very significant impact on protein stability. As you age and there is more oxidative stress in the body, the proteins in our cells which are essential to healthy functioning become unstable/aggregate, thereby leading to a loss of activity. This loss of activity of the essential proteins leads to the deterioration of health, so targeting oxidative stress to promote healthy ageing can be an effective strategy.
Clearly the impact of oxidative stress upon protein structure is significant and since structure and function are inexplicably, linked the functionality of the proteins are likely to be hinder"

Adding the blast option to the parts registry has also     been suggested to locate parts of interest. We are sure all of us would     like to see gene-protein and pathway information if these information     was integrated into the database and offered automatically for each     entry in the database.

Tuebingen,2014,Team:Tuebingen#Project#Motivation_-_-_TEXT.html," This process could be realized technically by  immobilizing the enzymes onto a column. To convert a blood preservation, it is only necessary to  apply the preservation onto the column. The process of conversion can therefore get highly  automatized.
So a new blood donation and reception system making use of converted blood cells could improve  several aspects of the transfusion medicine. First of all the amount of blood tests would decrease. All  donations would be immediately converted and the only blood test would be a blood quality control  after conversion is done. Patients with rare blood groups now can be supplied sufficiently with blood  preservations and there will not be a deficit of a certain blood group again. Due to the consequent  conversion of blood cells, all blood preservations will be able to be used. This would result in a more  efficient use of donated blood and in less disposal of preservations. Moreover, an automated process  would result in faster handling and more efficient preservation supply of patients.
Last but not least, the possibility to supply preservations to every patient in nearly any amount and  higher performance will save lives.

Best Software Tool Special Prize
Regardless of the topic, iGEM projects often create or adapt computational tools to move the project forward. Because they are born out of a direct practical need, these software tools (or new computational methods) can be surprisingly useful for other teams. Without necessarily being big or complex, they can make the crucial difference to a project's success. This award tries to find and honor such ""nuggets"" of computational work.

- Safety -
We all believe in safety!
oh safety!
What do we think about safety?
Before starting any experiment...
... we were kindly training by a biosafety expert, Neuza Antunes, responsible for all the training programs of biological safety and risk prevention. In our institution, we have an internal committee for accident prevention and a waste management department that seeks to properly instruct about accident prevention, emergency responses, safety practices to work with genetically modified organisms and biological risks. In our institution we use the ""Biosafety Manual"" of professor Mario Hiroyuki Hirata, ISBN: 9788520433164 and the guideline ""Good laboratory practice"" ISBN: 9788520433164.
To perform any experiment we use personal protective equipment such as lab coat, proper shoes,   gloves and the collective protection equipment necessary to handle genetically modified organisms or other organisms of biological risk of type II.
Our chassis are noninfectious and non-pathogenic organisms and we are aware about all the good practices for the correct disposal of biological waste, necessary to prevent gene transfer to related species, horizontal gene transfer, direct and indirect effects on non-target organisms, development of resistance in target organisms, and effects on biodiversity.
We are aware that inherent risks of working with genetically modified organisms are possible because of the unpredicted nature of altering the DNA sequence. However, we work consciously and we seek to modify as little as possible our chassis to perform our goal.

Tufts,2015,Team:Tufts#app scenario_-_-_TEXT.html," of the technology. Doudna is suing over the patent rights of CRISPR, claiming that she was the first to invent the technology as well the first to file for a patent over the CRISPR-Cas9 system – seven months before Zhang [1]. Winning this lawsuit and the patent right to CRISPR-Cas9 has immense implications; the patent is essentially worth billions of dollars, seeing as CRISPR-Cas9 is a breakthrough technology potential for successful gene therapy. Furthermore, the owner of the patent will be credited as the inventor of this novel technology, and will be able to control the usage of the technology by other scientists.
  The Doudna/Zhang lawsuit over patent rights juxtaposes the values of the iGEM foundation because of the foundation’s emphasis on open biology. The foundation encourages collaboration between teams and is committed to fostering a global and open research community. Although iGEM teams compete at the Jamboree each year, open biology allows teams to build off of one another’s projects, encouraging students to contribute their unique perspectives in order to develop projects even further year after year. This competition is, in many ways, an experiment to test the waters of open biology.
  The field of synthetic biology has grown at an exponential rate compared to many other STEM fields, partially because of the pace at which students are encouraged to produce biobricks and share them publically. Teams have developed useful technologies such as a spoiled meat detector that could benefit the food industry, while foregoing the potential profit as well as potential lawsuits should the product fail. This could lead to a system that exists as a zero-sum game with no risk and no reward. CRISPR-Cas9 is a breakthrough idea in science and would allow synthetic biology to progress at an incredibly fast pace. Academics can build off one another’s achievements without a need to engage in legal battles, while allowing scientists to turn their findings into affordable tools for everyday use.
  While this experiment is a great success for synthetic biology, it is unclear whether the model will function among professionals. Without privatization, scientists cannot claim ownership of their work -- or profit from it -- which could stifle innovation. The scientific “free market” would be passive; and a decline in novel technologies would follow – decreasing the benefits to the general public. The lack of risk could also serve as a benefit if there is no risk of liability or of being sued.
  Lawsuits have historically been a pressing issue for small biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies. Over the past decade there has been an increasing number of “patent trolls”; companies which"

Model 3: The Growth rate model
Introduction
The mathematical models that can predict the growth rate of a microorganism population under a set of environmental conditions is useful for many research. Many growth models have been proposed, such as the widely used Logistics model. However, when primary models are applied to bacterial growth curves, the biological variability is reduced to a single curve defined by some kinetic parameters (lag time and growth rate), and sometimes the models give poor fits in some regions of the curve. Moreover, the number of experiment is usually limited for most iGEM teams (relative to the threshold to get credible growth curve). To solve this problem and get the credible growth curve, we built a random effect multiplicative heteroscedastic model. The model combines nonparametric theory and bootstrap techniques that can get a prediction band with a probability of 0.95(95%) to predict the optimal growth curve.
Modeling
The process of this non-parametric model is shown in Figure 3. The theory basis of this model (including 4 steps) was supplemented in the note.
Figure 3.1 The process of the non-parametric model
Analysis and Results
As shown in Figure 3.2, we found that the non-parametric model can predict the process of bacteria growth rate very well, and the nisin antibacterial activity is enhanced as the concentration increased. The results were obtained by only 3 groups of experimental data, indicating that this model can get the credible results by a smaller amount of data.

3 ) to design 28 mutants. We hypothesized the trans-2-pentenal would occupy a highly similar structural space as triclosan. Analysis of triclosan bound to NADH in the active site revealed that the phenyl ring of triclosan lined up face to face with the ring of NADH forming a pi-stacking interaction. We hypothesized that if we could increase the pi-stacking interaction by mutating residues around the triclosan-NADH site to be aromatic residues, we might be able to increase the enzyme’s activity on trans-2-pentenal.
Each mutant was generated using kunkel mutagenesis through the transcriptic cloud laboratory . The sequence verified mutant genes were cloned into our expression strain of E. coli and protein produced and purified as described in our Notebook [LINK]. From this initial round of 28 mutants, 23 expressed as soluble protein. Of the solubly expressed designs 4 of the designs had no effect on function, and 19 decreased activity.   However, one of the enzymes resulted in 1.5x increase in activity against the non-natural trans-2-pentenal substrate.
We are currently exploring new mutants based on the data generated from this first round of screens. While the enzyme activity needs to be improved ~100-fold in order to achieve levels of activity observed on the native substrate, this is well within reach of enzyme engineering efforts based on previous successes [30][31][32]

In the lab we used an EPOCH spectrophotometer to run our assays. At a price tag of ~$10,000 this device is definitely out of the budget range of a high school teacher, so we looked for a more appropriately priced alternative.
We found a colorimeter device from IO Rodeo, a company that develops open source hardware and software for educational purposes. They sold a spectrophotometer which we hypothesized would work for our assay for $80. One reason for the price difference is the EPOCH is a monochronometer covers a spectrum from 200 nm - 999 nm, selectable in 1 nm increments.  The IO Rodeo is based on an 365nm LED and requires hardware changes to adjust the wavelength of emission and detection.  Our enzyme assay is based on oxidation of the enzyme cofactor NADH into NAD.  The standard wavelength for detection of this reaction is 340nm, however the NADH has a broad spectrum (see figure below).  Based on the differences in NAD and N"
Paris,2009,Team:Paris#EthicalReportFullIntroduction_-_-_TEXT.html,"iplinarity which sponsored the creation of the inter-institute Paris IGEM team, I wanted to be part of the Paris IGEM team in order to observe the team in the 2009 competition and to see how the team engineered biology and how they dealt with and interpreted the ethical aspects of synthetic biology. This participation was a very good way for me to enlighten knowledge and productions process of a team of student in synthetic biology and for the other students to reflect on ethical issues, which we were able to build on together.
With this perspective, and I am to avoid the conceit “sociological” in my observation, nevertheless this report has to be understood from the perspective “science and technology studies”, with references and concepts that are situated in that academic context. My primary goal in precisely situating my point of view is to be precise what it is not : this report is not the  reflexion of a scientist about his/her own practices, but the look of a student of science and technology studies about what students of science are saying about their work.
In my daily work with the IGEM team, some important methodological questions had to be answered :  I decided to use a qualitative and participant-based approach, preferring collective experience of reflexion of ethical reflexion to data. This report won't have any graphics with team-members-answers to pre-set questionnaires, instead our meetings and talks were dynamic and I decided not to constrain the scope of the discussion by my up stream reflexions. That process also permitted discussions were coexisted sociological and scientific stakes, when everyone of us were trying to find answers to our own research programs. That was, for me, the greatest benefit to my privileged access to a scientific field, having the opportunity to discussed these questions with the team.
My discussions with the team started with a series of individual conversations with almost all students of the team. Depending on student, these discussions were all very different  and at the end of the first round of conversation, I sought to bring together all the different stakes and questions brought by the individual team members in a collective and dynamic reflexion process. We decided to schedule collective talks, each about one hour long and focusing an pre decided themes, in order to delimit stakes. For certain discussions, I had to make a presentation, to put into light the history of a concept, to share with the team my reading on the subject or to highlight what seemed important to me, as a sociologist. That way, I shared with the team my own system of  references, they were able to know through what “regard” I appreciated"

During the course of this iGEM edition, TU Delft embarked on an ambitious and challenging journey for the realization of its project. However, we believe that the iGEM experience is more than just carrying out complex microbiological lab work and developing complicated yet cutting-edge models: iGEM is also a worldwide community that continues to expand, with more than 300 teams participating from all around the world this year. Consequently, TU Delft organized an European iGEM Meetup in which teams from all over Europe were invited to join us in Delft, the Netherlands. Approximately 200 attendees from 9 different countries had the chance to get to know each other, engage in a debate about synthetic biology and its future prospects,"

E. coli DB5 Drifting with Flow of Medium
Figure 37: A video showing E. coli cells moving, from the top-right in a down/left direction, in a sample at 5x magnification.
Results: Though the moving diffraction patterns are faint, it cn be seen that the movement of each cell in the above video is identical, smooth and in a single direction. Hence, we assert that the motion is drift, rather than autonomous transit.
Conclusions
In summary, we can draw several conclusions. We have had some successes and have seen some areas that seem promising but require more work.
The main shortcomings:
Creating a closed analysis system using a milli-fluidic chamber.
We came to realise that we required a thinner analysis chamber. Some evidence can be found here .
Inserting MEX-1 into the outer membrane of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii.
Our transformation of C. reinhardtii failed. As mentioned here .
Quantifying the motility of organisms using our DIHM setup.
We could see C. reinhardtii moving on various occasions, but failed to observe the motility of E. coli DB5, a motile strain. As discussed here .
Using a UI to control the DIHM from a third party computer.
We had a great design, there was a compatibility bug that we could not fix in the time we had. As seen here .
The main successes:
We created inexpensive and functioning upright DIHM hardware and open source holography software.
The hardware can be seen here . The software is discussed here .
We created blob detection software which is capable of finding cells of a given size in a focused image.
The software is mentioned in more detail here .
We successfully observed the shapes of organisms using our DIHM and holography software.
This can be seen here .
We calculated the cell density of samples consistently to a fair degree of accuracy, using our DIHM and holography software.
As shown here .
We confirmed that C. reinhardtii and E. coli can grow together in a co-culture.
This is evidenced here .
We successfully constructed our MEX-1 plasmid.
Though we didn't manage to make C. reinhardtii accept it, we present proof that we correctly constructed it here .
Hence, our overarching conclusion is that digital holography is not only low-cost, easily adapted and useful for analysing co-cultures but also holds great potential in terms of future applications. We mention one such future application on our Applied Design page.

Evry & Ionis-Paris
The European Experience, a collaboration between Evry and Ionis, held in Paris over the 2nd and 3rd of July, was a massive success. It attracted 28 European teams from 11 countries, where each team presented their project informally through a poster.
We discovered some exciting project ideas including producing bio-plastics on Mars, and building a DIY 3D printer for tissues.
United Kingdom iGEM meet up
Westminster UoW
In August, we were invited to the UK Teams’ Meet-up at the University of Westminster. Almost the whole team decided to head to London to interact with local teams and gain feedback about our project. It was a really friendly atmosphere when we arrived and we even bumped into the UEA (University of East Anglia) iGEM team on our way to the University as we both tried to navigate our way around London.
The meet-up was a two-day engagement and both days consisting of a number of engaging talks in the morning with presentations from other iGEM teams about their projects in the afternoon.

Helping others
During our project we tried to be as helpful as possible to the other teams.
We've tried to share our experiences on our blog . Especially the description of our best mistakes , resulted in a quite a lot of response from other teams, who where having similar problems. Hopefully they avoided making the same mistakes.
We all contributed to the Valencia's survey , and got a gold medal for helping them. Thanks Valencia :-)
To make things easier in the lab for ourselves and for other teams we made a program for the Ti84 pocket calculator, which we posted on our wiki under Tools . The program makes it easy to calculate concentrations and volumes for making the optimal ligation mix.
We have improved the characterization of the part pSB1A3 .
We have corresponded with the other Danish team DTU-Denmark and agreed to help each other by evaluating our presentations before the competition this way getting a good sense of what we can do to optimize the communication of our project.
We also corresponded with Team Groningen from the Netherlands and helped them solve some problems similar to those we were facing at the beginning of the project. We had learned by experience that small concentrations of DNA in the samples were causing the problem and therefore advised the team to use PCR to increase the concentration there samples to get a better result.
Thanks
We would like to thank the kind people from DTU-Denmark for helping us throughout the competition.
Thanks to Team Groningen for exchanging ideas and problem solving with our common ligation troubles.
A really big hug goes to Meagan and the rest of the HQ for their fast response and help with everything else!
And of course, all of this couldn't have been posible without the support from the University of Southern Denmark and our sponsors. Especially Peder Thusgaard Ruhoff from BMB, deserves great credit for making this possible.

1.With the help of Mr. Wanshun Ma and Qiong Guo from Beijing Institute of Nanoenergy and Nanosystems, Chinese Academy of Science(CAS), we got Caulobacter crescentus CB15 from ATCC.
2.We got E. coli S17-1 from Professor Tao Zhu in University of Science and Technology of Tianjin and also as key scientist of Cansino, which would be utilized for conjugation with C. crescentus.
3.Experiment Practice.
July 30th 1. Preparation of competent bacteria S17-1 and using it, red fluorescent protein (mRFP) was successfully transformed.
July 2nd 1. Start construction of the first shuttle plasmid for conjugation OriT-RFP.
July 4th With bacterial colony PCR, we were attempting to get DgrA and DgrB, which are indispensable for flagellum synthesis and fortunately, DgrA band appeared.
July 5th Again using bacterial colony PCR, we got DgrB band.
July 22nd Construct OriT-RFP plasmid using 3A assembly methods.
July 26th Successfully constructed Orit-RFP plasmid and made a conjugation using it. Though it seemed worked, results from electrophoresis were not exactly correct. The reason was unknown.
August 6th Trying to guide the plasmid into* C. crescentus* by electrotransformation, including the preparation of competent cell and electrotransformation procedure. This method was tried 6 times in August, but it failed again and again. Finally, we had no alternative but to try on conjugation again.
August 8th Redesign the primer used for standardization of DgrA, DgrB and HfiA which controls the biosynthesis of holdfast.
August 9th Add promoter on DgrA, DgrB and HfiA.
August 21st Failing to get the correct sequence of R0051-DgrA, we all ascribe to promoter in Parts.

After finishing the brochure, we delivered the brochures to farmers who contacted us online though China. In brief, nearly 400 brochures were sent to twelve cities and counties in China, including Suzhou, Yanan, Yancheng, Jining, Guanzhou and so on.
Bio-safety
Questionnaire about laws on transgene and bio-safety
In order to know more about the opinions on transgene laws from iGEMers and students majoring in synthetic biology, we designed questionnaires and finished the survey. 177 students finished our questionnaire, most of whom were iGEMers or undergraduates and graduates majoring in biology. We found out that laws on bio-safety problems still need to be advertised, since a number of students were not familiar with them and thought it would be helpful to know more. Also, we provided some of the details in the laws, and majority students replied that they were useful to their study and research work.
Video about bio-safety in laborites
This year, UCAS iGEM team collaborated with other nine Chinese iGEM team, making a series of videos which focused on bio-safety to help Chinese students learn more about bio-safety. The topic of our team’s video is personal protective equipment, mainly concerns about the proper use of gloves, lab coat etc in laborites. Here comes our video.

Communication activities
Introduction video to GFP protein and awards
This August, Institute of Physics Chinese Academy of Science, Beijing Association for Science and Technology etc organization held a “3 minutes for science” activity, aiming to collect videos which introduce scientific phenomenon to the public. Our team members made a video to introduce GFP protein and relative knowledge, won the special award and had our video broadcast in the Scientific Carnival in Beijing Olympic Parks.
Our own We Chat official account
Since WeChat has been widely used in China, we decided to create our own official account to get more people know us and iGEM competition. In the past two months, we have shared introduction of iGEM competition and some details of our team's project. To sum up, we received 7731 clicks and more than 3783 persons read our passages.

After this we start spreading the game: we wrote about it on our facebook and twitter, on RPGmaker forums, on facebook school pages, we spoke with our friends, family etc.
We also offer the diffusion of the game as a collaboration with other iGEM groups: if they advertised the game in at least four different internet groups with at least 50 people on everyone, they could get this medal as a prove of their collaboration.
We gave this medal to Teams TecMonterrey and Valencia_Biocampus. By the time of the wiki freeze, we have reached 440 people with the Spanish version. The English version wasn’t properly outreached due to lack of time: if we reach the jamboree at the MIT, we are going to distribute it all over the world!
In total, that means that 440 people know now about SynBio because of our game, and that only with Spanish native speakers! Who knows how much people are we going to be able to reach with our newly finished English version!.

Hypothesis
It has been reported that TAL effectors target genes efficiently in many eukaryocytes like mammalian cells and yeasts. However, the former experiments with E. coli indicate that TAL effectors don’t work well in E. coli cells. There are a variety of factors can possibly be attributed to its low efficiency, and homologous recombination is a highly possible one.
As is known since the discovery of Holliday junction, homologous recombination can happen to DNA sequences sharing common region, and only depends on the homology of the two sequences. We have introduced that TALE is composed of many highly conserved repeats, with only the 2 amino acids at position 12 and 13 in difference, which reasonably leads to in cell homologous recombination under the functions of Rec family proteins.

- Titering result revealed an adequate plaque number at -2 dilution for each mutagen concentration. We thus plate 50 plates using 500ug -2 dilution and x8 agar. As control, 5 plates were plated using 0ug -2 dilution and x8 agar.
4) Large Plaque Confirmation 1 (6.19)
- We selected 12 of the largest plaques that we could find from our Selection Test 1
- For each plaque, we scrapped off of the plaque with a pipet tip and then dipped it in 100ul of LB in an eppendorf tube.
- To 12 test tubes each, we added 750ul of BL21 overnight.
- We then added 30ul of phage from each eppendorf tube into one of the 12 test tubes and let it incubate at room temperature for 20 minutes.
- Next, we added 7ml of x8 top agar to each test tube and plated it on 12 LB plates.
- Placed in 37 C incubator for about 24 hours.
5) Large Plaque Confirmation 2 (6.24)
- Using the 70uL (100uL - the 30uL used) stock from 6.19, we performed dilution series 1:100 to generate -2 and -4 stock.
- 0, -2, and -4 stock from each plaque was plated using 0.75mL of BL21 overnight, 30uL of phage, and 7mL of x8 top agar. Similar procedures as those in 6.19 were used.
- The plates were incubated in 37 C incubator for approximately 24 hours.
V) Results
1) Applying the mutagen
No obvious signs of clearage was seen after 30 minutes of incubation with phage.
2) Titer to determine phage concentration
There was a little variation in the number of plaques as the mutagen concentration increased, but there was no clear sign of phage death due to the mutagen. Each dilution showed plaques up to -3.
3) Selection Test 1
Each plate had roughly 25 to 50 plaques on it with natural variation in plaque sizes. From all these plaques, we selected 12 that appeared to be bigger than normal.
4) Large Plaque Confirmation 1
All the plates seemed to have been completely or almost cleared by the phage, leaving no visible plaque sizes. Also, the plates were contaminated.

Collaborations
We collaborated with team Evry to investigate if TAL-based transcriptional regulators are functional in cells of amphibians and in multicellular animals. Frog oocytes and embryos transfected with plasmids containing mCitrine reporter under the minimal promoter and an upstream TAL-operator exhibited fluorescence when it was cotransfected with TAL-VP16 activator. This fluorescence was absent in cells and animals that were transfected only with the mCitrine reporter (described in the Switch section ). This collaborative result demonstrates that TAL based genetic logic could be used to regulate complex properties in multicellular organisms, which has many important implications for the potential therapeutic use.
We provided parts that were not included in the distribution to the Warsaw team .
We provided additional information about the part development to Peking team .
We were pleased when the Wageningen team sent us a mail after the European jamboree that they were amazed by our project and that they introduced features of our pharmacokinetic model into their project.
We participated in the survey of TU Munich team .
We had discussions with a member of St. Andrews team that visited us. We welcome all other visitors as well.

Team: Can  you  tell  us  about  the  various  techniques  that  are  currently  available  for  detection  of   food spoilage? Professor Mishra: there  are  old  traditional  techniques  which  include  various  types  of  plating   methods,  and  techniques  to  obtain  microbial  counts  which have  been  in  use  since  decades.   Among the new methods, electronic sensor­ based techniques are more prevalent. Nowadays,   biological  kits,  for  detecting  specific  pathogenic  microbes  like  salmonella  are  also  available.   HiMedia is one such company making biochemical test kits. Team: The  acceptability  of  GMOs  by  the  public  is  often  seen  as  an  issue  when  a  genetically   engineered product is released in the market. What are your views regarding the acceptability of   our product, if commercialized? Professor Mishra: There  has  always  been  a  big  divide  in  the  Indian  society  when  it  comes  to   acceptance of any genetically engineered product. Equal groups of people are willing to accept   and  equal  groups  are  against  it.  Most  are  concerned  regarding  the  safety  of  the  product,   whether it has any side effects or not, since that has never been established in a solid manner   in the past. If somehow we can establish that our product is absolutely SAFE for consumer use,   then we can surely think of a long ­term capture of the market. Team: How do  you propose we  can  solve these issues regarding acceptability of our product, if   released? Professor Mishra:: We first need to analyse what the consumers want from our product. As in most of   the  food  products,  it  is  the  economic  and  nutritional  benefits  that  they  look  for...and   simultaneously the product must be safe to use continuously. These days, due to high level of   adulteration in food products, consumers are always in an apprehending mode and try to avoid   new products. But the change has to come at some point.

Team Student Academy:
E. coli Mach1 with pMTE cp46 His received from the working group “Fermentation Engineering”, University Bielefeld. Plasmid contains genes for GFP and kanamycine resistance. We plated it and made a liquid culture at 37°C. Result: There was an intense fluorescence. We made a glycerol stock  and a plasmid isolation.
Team Cloning of Bacterial Laccases:
We did colony PCRs on the transformations from the day before. We got product for every transformation approach so we plated the positive colonies on new plates to make plasmid isolation. So hopefully in some days we have the plasmids with the E. coli laccase, the Xanthomonas campestris laccase and the B. pumilus laccase with the inducible T7 promoter and a His-tag.
Figure 1:Saturation curves of TVEL0 activity with 0.1 mM and 0.05 mM ABTS (n=24).
Team Activity Tests:
After establishing our recipe for activity measurements we were curious about different ABTS concentrations and wanted to make sure we took the right one for our approach. With this in mind we did our activity measurement with 0.1 U TVEL0 laccase , 100 mM sodium acetate buffer (pH 5), ad 200 µl H2O dest., but with two new ABTS concentrations, namely 0.2 mM and 0.05 mM ABTS (see Fig. 1). It turned out that using 0.05 mM ABTS leads to a low maximum of saturation but reaches it quickly. With 0.2 mM ABTS the opposite occurs: the activity curve is saturated at a OD420 of ~2.7 but it needs more time to reach its maximum. Knowing this we are happy using 0.1 mM ABTS because it is saturating slowly and the maximum is not too high. 0.1 mM ABTS is therefore established!

Safety forms were approved on 9/20/13 by David Lloyd and Julie McNamara.
Overview
Brigham Young University has set protocols aimed at ensuring student safety in the laboratory. Students are required to wear long pants and close-toed, waterproof shoes and follow safety precautions for working with chemicals and biological agents (protective clothing including gloves, etc.). They are prohibited from eating in laboratory rooms. The labs are kept locked when not in use and are subjected to random inspections to ensure that safety procedures are followed.
All biological agents we are working with are BSL1 (E. coli and various phages) or BSL2 (Vibrio cholera, ATCC 14035). Dr. Julianne Grose, our instructor, has received BYU approval to work with BSL-2 reagents. All students involved have been trained to handle cholera safely. We have followed current safety measures for disposing of biological samples in biohazard waste as well as cleaning glassware and desktops with bleach and/or ethanol.
All BioBrick parts created and used are non-hazardous and have been contained to the lab.
The Institutional Biosafety Committee (IBC) at Brigham Young University supervises the use of recombinant DNA and handles other biological safety and hazard issues in experiments."

Wiki
We've put a lot of work into our wiki this year. The most important part of course is the content. We used Google Docs to write and work as a team - resolving a total over 600 comments. Adam, our student leader who did the bulk of wiki editing made over 1300 edits - and as a result has gone slightly insane.
Several wikis we looked at were inaccessibly written - often lacking good explanations and having little page structure. This is likely down to the last minute rush before the deadline. We started early and spent a long time perfecting our text, so hopefully you find it all makes sense.
Another problem is that previous wikis are slow to load. They often have large swathes of redudant code and uncompressed images are commonly uploaded at much higher resolutions than needed. We saw some homepages well over 10MB! Our homepage is just 0.7MB, and all our other pages are similarly optimized. We've done this by analysing our site with Google's Pagespeed and Lighthouse auditing tools to find where we could improve. We correctly sized and compressed images, reused files so they can be cached and used SVGs where possible for diagrams.
As SVGs can be embedded more easily into the page, page load times are improved as the browser doesn't have to fetch the images seperately. SVGs also allow for infinite scalability allowing our wiki to take advantage of high resolution screens like Apple's 'Retina Displays'. They're also powerful as they allow text to actually be text rather than pixels - allowing screenreaders to read diagrams, improving the accessibility of our wiki. The worst cases we’ve seen are are wikis that are just huge PNGs - they take forever to load, don’t allow you to select text, are inaccessible to the visually-impaired and lack links and citations embedded in the text.

Week One--June 9th
This week was my first working on Berkeley's iGem Computational Team.  The week was spent mostly getting background information about the topic.  I knew very little about biology and, much less, synthetic biology coming into this project, but with the help of Nade and Matt as well as Professor Anderson, I am beginning to understand the process.  With my introduction to biology, I was also introduced to various computational tools used in the field of synthetic biology like BioJade, APE, and GenoCAD.  Our  tool, Clotho, will have many of the features of these tools in addition to others.
Specifically, the project that I will be working on will be to add an assembly feature to our software.  This feature will be  used to input a specific set of goal parts and return an output of all possible subparts both in text and graphical display.  This result will be achieved through the implementation of an algorithm, which optimally assembles a goal part.
Next week, I will begin implementing this algorithm as well as constructing the basic design of my ""Assembly View"".
Week Two--June 16th
I began this week my creating the view I wanted for assembling parts.  Below I have included a screen shot of the assembly window as well as a  description of each feature.

A video shows that two of our team members are having great fun at our favourite company. Do you know the name of the second member that appears in the video?
For one of our models we had to do very extensive computations. To prevent our own computers from overheating and to keep the temperature in our iGEM room at a normal level, we used a supercomputer. Which centre maintains this supercomputer? (Dutch abbreviation)
We organised a symposium with a debate, some seminars and 2 iGEM project presentations. An iGEM team came all the way from the Netherlands to present their project. What is the name of their city?
Now put all of these in this URL:https://2013.igem.org/Team:KU_Leuven/(firstname)(abbreviation)(city), (loose the brackets and put everything in lowercase) and follow the very last instruction to get your special jamboree prize!

Design of the Sticker Model
The original way of administering our BanAphids to plants, via a spraying system, is perfectly suited for our end-users, the farmers . However, some of them felt that the direct use of bacteria on crops would scare off consumers. Also, regulations do not allow the spreading of genetically modified organisms in the environment. That's why we came up with a way to keep the BanAphids in a container, a small bag or sticker. However, if our BanAphids are held in a contained environment, the direct contact between bacteria and aphids is lost, as well as the honeydew cue for the production of methyl salicylate. Because of this, an oscillating"

MAGE cultures that recovered overnight were saturated, so we made 1:1000, 1:10000, and 1:100000 dilutions and plated 20µL of each onto amp plates and left at 30˚C overnight.
MAGE round 2 cultures from yesterday:
We did a PCR (His_F and and His_R primers) on 24 of the 48 cultures we grew and sent them off for sequencing.
Results of NM culture:
The selection strain (∆HisB∆pyrF∆rpoZ+pKD46) did not grow in NM, which is worrisome.  None of the MAGE samples grew in NM either, so either they all have HisB knocked out or there is something wrong already with the strain's His pathway.
We will grow up selection strain (without pKD46) from glycerol stock in LB+tet and transform with Vatsan's plasmid tomorrow to see if that has any effect on the his-deficiency phenotype.
Kan-ZFB insertion: modified nucleotides:
Primers finally arrived that would put modified nucleotides on the 5' ends of the insert, which should improve lambda red efficiency.
PCR: KAPA protocol with Kan forward phosphorthioate and URA2 reverse phosphorthioate, 56˚C annealing, 90 sec elongation, 25 cycles, 1µL kan-ZFB-hisura DNA as template
Results: PCR only produced a smaller side product. This is strange since we also ran a gel of all our different kan-ZFB-hisura purifications and they all run at the correct size (see images below).

NUS_Singapore-Sci,2018,Team:NUS Singapore-Sci#Reporter Overview_-_-_TEXT.html," used as a marker for transfection efficiency and the overall fusion protein expression level. The EGFP gene is modified such that the start codon of EGFP is mutated (ATG → ACG), resulting in a truncated GFP that is non-functional (Figure 1). Since the minimal fluorescence region for EGFP is from amino acid 7-229 (Li et al., 1997), this truncation mutation will cause the production of non-functional EGFP protein, while mCherry expression is not affected. However, when this mutation (ACG → ATG)  is corrected by our RESCUE Editor system , the normal expression of EGFP is restored and can be visualised either on a fluorescence microscope or via flow cytometry.
Both the mCherry and the EGFP genes in the fusion protein are linked by a self-cleavage peptide, T2A. When the ribosome reaches the T2A oligopeptide during translation, it will fall off from the mRNA and translation would be restarted for the next fluorescence gene. We chose T2A among the 2A family peptides as it has the highest cleavage efficiency (Liu et al., 2017). This is to ensure that expression of EGFP and mCherry are under the control of the same promoter, such that the level of mCherry fluorescence is linearly correlated to the level of EGFP fluorescence. In this way, the mCherry expression would be a useful indicator to normalise the expression of the dual reporter system between individual cells in a transient transfection experiment.
The relative number of editing events can be quantified by the percentage of dual-colored cells transfected with mutant ACG reporter as compared to cells transfected with the WT reporter, or relative green fluorescence intensity after normalizing to the red fluorescence intensity. We will be testing our reporter system in both E. coli and transfected HEK293T cells.
A further modification to the original EGFP and mCherry sequence is a six amino acid truncation at the N-terminus of EGFP and a seven amino acid truncation at the C-terminus of mCherry. Since EGFP and mCherry have the same nucleotide sequence for the first 22 and last 23 nucleotides, such truncation makes cloning easier. Moreover, since bacteria like E. coli can utilize alternative start codon GUG up to 13% of the time (Hecht et al., 2017), and the first 18 nucleotides of EGFP sequence contain one GUG, this truncation mutation will eliminate the chance of background translation"
Debrecen-Hungary,2010,Team:Debrecen-Hungary#project_-_-_TEXT.html,"CDNA3.1 results constitutive expression of the inserted part in the cells so the investigated part can be tested at functional level. The other expression vector is a fully SB (Synthetic Biology) compatible mammalian expression vector generated from pSB1A3. We inserted into the pSB1A3 the TRE (tetracycline response element) a strong CMV (cytomegalo virus) promoter and a PolyA element that is a terminator of transcription in mammalian cells. These four elements are available as individual parts in the parts registry and can be used in combination with other parts too.
Cloning
Basic Parts
18 basic parts have been inserted into pSB1C3 which contain 3 DBDs, 1 hinge, 11 LBDs, 2 regulators and 1 apoptosis protein. A Gal4 DBD which has the RFC25 N terminal linkers was designed and submitted to be used (BBa_K364319).
Composite Parts
13 composite parts have been created, ten of them consist of two basic parts, one of them has been built up from three basic parts, and an expression vector from standard biobrick parts has been created by using four basic parts. The backbone has been opened with AgeI and PstI restriction enzymes in order to ligate the part cut out with NgoMIV and PstI. The previous restriction digests have been repeated so each part could be inserted after the previous one.
Gal4-human LBD fusions
Two human nuclear hormone receptor LBDs (Pregnane X Receptor LBD, Estrogen Receptor LBD) have been inserted into pSB1C3 after Gal4 was ligated into the backbone. The Gal4 (438 bp) is a modular protein consisting of a DNA-binding domain and an activation domain which can be used in Two-Hybrid system in order to identify interactions between two proteins or a protein with DNA. The length of PXR LBD is 732 bp while the ER LBD is 828 bp long, so the fusion leads to 1170 bp and 1266 bp long composite inserts.

Hi:) I  am Gill from Taiwan and currently a year two student in CUHK. The part I like  IGEM competition most is that IGEM is a student-oriented competition. Thus,  Other than cultivating research abilities and learning important scientific  techniques, IGEM taught me much more than these. Since we have limited time and  resource, I learn to cherish and arrange what we have and make best use of them  in an efficiency way. As a nonlocal student, I learn to cooperate with students  with different background and overcome language barrier. After spending whole  summer in the lab, I gonna miss all these crazy days and nights  in the lab.

Hello, I’m Natalie. Participating in iGEM is a very precious experience for me. I tried plenty of different things that are completely new for me, such as doing lab works, contacting different biotech companies, holding talks for high school students, etc. It feels really good when you successfully solve new challenges and each time I gained a lot form them. All my teammates are also very integral parts of why this competition is so enjoyable. Though each of us has distinct personalities, we got the same goal of perfecting our project. I’m really glad that I can join iGEM, winning knowledge and friendships from it.

This amounts to a net increase in market value of more than 22 billion dollars ( Mordor intelligence ). The specific market segments we are addressing are molecular tests for infectious diseases as well as microbial and viral tests. These market segments are expected to grow above average compared to the overall IVD market growth, where molecular test for infectious diseases experience vastest growth of up to 9% annually ( Kalorama information ). Generally the profitability of players in the molecular diagnostics field lies between 15 and 20% ( Roche Half Year report 2017 ). The key factors to successfully enter the IVD market are the integration of our unique technique within other techniques, and its capability for rapid and versatile diagnosis at the molecular level, especially for detection of infection diseases. These technological advantages contribute to a strong position within the identified markets.
SWOT analysis
For the commercialisation of CINDY Seq, the strengths and weaknesses of our product were considered. We did this via a so-called SWOT analysis. SWOT stands for ""Strengths Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats"", and is frequently used by companies to determine how its objectives can be accomplished, and what obstacles must be overcome or minimized to achieve desired results. It allows to see where our technology CINDY Seq is today, and where it may be positioned in the future.   The SWOT analysis is further divided in an internal and an external analysis. The internal analysis is done to identify the values and the weaknesses that should be covered to achieve a stronger market position. The external analysis is done to clarify the opportunities we have to grasp and to acknowledge the threats against which we have to protect CINDY Seq.
Internal analysis
Strengths
:
We already have a proof of concept and a strong IP position.
CINDY Seq is a versatile tool to obtain both simplex and multiplex results.
CINDY Seq is rapid, cheap and meets all safety requirements posed by the iGEM competition.
Weaknesses
:
CINDY Seq relies on other techniques, for example in our applied design Cas13a is required for detection
Because CINDY Seq relies on other techniques, the values rapidity, low-cost and on-site are highly dependent on other steps in the detection method. For example, in our applied design the detection of genes takes a few hours due to the steps during sample preparation. In addition, lab equipment and expertise till a certain extend is required
External analysis
Opportunities
:
There is a high demand for frontline diagnostics.
The market is predicted to grow (see market"
BostonU_HW,2018,Team:BostonU HW#Hardware_-_-_TEXT.html,"processor. Our team also considered the use of a Raspberry Pi, but it contained more functions than needed for our project with fewer ports.
Manufacturing Method: TERRA is composed of 3D-printed supports, as 3D-printing is more accessible, lower-cost, and allows for rapid prototyping. While traditional machining, such as milling and turning, would result in tighter tolerances and more accurate parts, we realized the cost of manufacturing parts in a machine shop were high. In fact, many of these parts only include clearance holes, which will serve its purpose as long as they meet a minimum dimension.
Material: Since our team chose to manufacture our system with 3D-printing, we chose to create our parts with ABS. The typical material for 3D-printing is resin, as it is inexpensive, but resin lacks the resolution needed to create the negative features on certain parts. ABS is stiffer and allows for more accurate parts and is more durable than resin.
Motors: We chose to incorporate stepper motors to the XY-plane as it allowed for a minimum step resolution of 1.8 degrees, which translates to 0.20 mm per step. Stepper motors also allow for microstepping, which allows us to further improve the resolution to 1/16 of a step, or 0.0125 mm. The typical well to well distance of a 384 well-plate is 4.5 mm, so the higher the resolution, the more accurate the dispensing of fluid.
Building the First Prototype
The first iteration of the XY-stage was composed of 3D printed parts and HDPE machined parts. We chose to do so in order to test the accessibility of each manufacturing method. All parts were modeled in Creo Parametric and STL files were generated for 3D-printing using a UPrint SE and ABS stock material. The machined parts were created from HDPE stock and milled using a manual NC mill.
Since the first design was part of the prototyping stage, we had chosen to use open ended timing belts in order to have the freedom of adjusting the design of the XY-stage with the least amount of dimensional constraints. We realized, however, that the timing belts were difficult to maintain the correct amount of tension without a proper tensioner, which would not be possible to integrate to our system. Also, it would be difficult to standardize if the user were to cut their own timing belts according to how well they put together their XY-plane.
When designing the XY-stage, we decided that we would like the default, starting position of the plate holder"
