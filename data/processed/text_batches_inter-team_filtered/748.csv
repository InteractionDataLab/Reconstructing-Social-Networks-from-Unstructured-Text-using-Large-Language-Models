December 2013 – January 2014: Team selection
- iGEM competition presentation and explanations
- Constitution of the team by interviewing different students from Université Toulouse III Paul Sabatier and INSA de Toulouse
The adventure begins for the 2014 Toulouse iGEM Team!
Collapse
January – June 2014: Projects brainstorming
- Thanks to weekly meetings, our team was able to discuss about new project ideas.
- Many ideas were approached and debated regarding the feasibility thanks to the literature and supervisors including teachers and researchers.
This is a list of the main projects:
- Let's save our trees with SubtiTree: the purpose is to use Bacillus subtilis as an optimized bacterium to target and bind to a specific fungus and secrete fungicides to destroy it.
- E. coli cancer: the concept was to create a bacterium able to colonize specifically the hypoxic regions of the tumor. The oxygen-sensitive bacterium would not be able to develop in the healthy zones.
- Reduction of ruminants’ methane production: the goal is to reduce the production of methane by ingesting a microorganism in the animals' rumen. This bacterium would be able to reduce the quantity of metabolic hydrogen and eliminate the methanogenic Archaes population.
Collapse
June 2014: Choice of SubtiTree project
The discussion has been long to estimate the practicability of our final project. By the end of May, most of the ideas were eliminated but two of them remained: controlling the cancer or saving the trees. It became easily clear that SubtiTree was successfully completed whether regarding the scientific part or the ethical aspect. Indeed, our knowledge in medicine was not sufficient enough to evaluate the consequences of a bacterium injection in the human body for E. coli cancer. Therefore, the whole team agreed on focusing on a local issue as"
METU_Turkey_Software,2010,Team:METU Turkey Software_-_-_TEXT.html," but there     is no order in the information flow and no common standards. Furthermore,     the information bulk is being used in an ineffective manner. Some of     the parts distributed are known to be nonfunctional. Web pages for parts     contain lots of information, but majority of them, are again not ordered.     Moreover, some additional information had to be removed or replaced     in such a way that the information for parts can be used effectively.     And removal of the redundant bulk information related with parts at     iGEM’s web site had been recommended for future.
Although, the final standardization, which we have suggested is not     for general public use and it was urgently needed in order to satisfy     the needs of our algorithm. But, still it will be a valuable resource,     since it summarizes the basic information about the parts.
As the first step to build the proposed standardization template,     the headings selected related to parts are listed on Table 1. Submission     of part IDs for individual parts is an accepted and quite valuable way     of tracking information. Although, every part has unique partID, for     every part there is a need to assign unique part names as official iGEM     names. Part names will have an important role as they will be providing     the short description about the part, which synthetic biologists can     immediately recognize and utilize during the construction of unique     Biobricks. Additionally unique part names will be helpful to identify     the devices with more than one Biobrick in their constructs. Assignment     of unique and distinct names for parts describing their nature and content     will be helpful to researchers for the recognition of and search for     the parts.

One of which aimed to break the record for the longest DNA model in the world, which was a success! She likes to learn calligraphy on her spare time and would like someone to invent a teleportation machine that can help her commute to school.
Aesha Patel
4th Year
Aesha is a fourth year Biology Student at Ryerson University. She is highly interested in synthetic biology for its infinite applications and the way it can be used as solutions to a wide range of problems. For her, synthetic biology is essentially a lego factory for scientists. If you can dream it, it can (most likely) be engineered. She hopes to get Ryerson’s name into the scientific community and raise the interest for the field of synthetic biology. This way, the public can gain a better appreciation for this emerging field.
     Aesha is the team’s all-rounder from managing lab work, organizing outreach activities and developing the Wiki page. It gets pretty hectic but it is a way for her to learn a bit of everything. Her skills are a result of her previous volunteering experiences at a Botany and Molecular Biology Lab at Ryerson and her current co-op term at the Princess Margaret Cancer Research Tower. In the future, she hopes to establish a way to grow all plants in harsh conditions (maybe even Mars?) to address the problem on world hunger. She loves reading, biking, and (now) watching Star Trek. She is also a fan of FRIENDS, so ask her a trivia and she got the answer.

Sensitivity analysis
After the initial modeling of chemical reactions of the system, and having                     set a range of values ​​for each kind of parameter, based on the type of                     biological component and the nature of the reaction, we proceeded to                     sensitivity analysis for all parameters. Our goal is to characterize the                     parameters and apply this approach from a simple model to a more complex                     one such as the dcas-sgRNA system we studied later on.
Initially studying the bibliography and previous iGEM teams, we were able                     to gather several values ​​for the rates of transcription, translation and                     degradation of the components, and we set the range in which each parameter                     ranges. Next, we created the samples within the defined range using                     Saltelli's sampling scheme from SALib Library [3]. In particular, we used                     for each variable N = 40,000 samples translated into 880,000 parameter                     sets, for the calculation of first and second order Sobol indices through                     the relation: sets=N(2D +2), where D is the number of parameters. At first,                     we had a smaller sample size and we noticed that several sensitivity                     indices values ​​were negative, or with a confidence interval greater than                     50% of their value, so we increased sample size to get more accurate                     values, which we judged based on how small their confidence interval is.
Figure 4, shows First and Total order sensitivity indices from the first                     sensitivity analysis we applied. This analysis contains all the parameters                     of the system, and we used it as the initial criterion for the significance                     of each parameter. The ranges of parameters, that were defined after our                     study, are listed in the workflow sensitivity analysis section. Second                     order indices of this analysis were not quoted, because their values were                     so small that they make their investigation unnecessary.

ShanghaiTech,2018,Team:ShanghaiTech#Improve_-_-_TEXT.html," over previous iGEM parts that submitted in 2013:
Reduce leak: As our pT181 attenuator could regulate both transcription and translation in a single compact RNA mechanism, which means it could provide stronger functions without increasing burden. This dual control repressor is able to increases repression from 85% to 98%.
Characterization
We generated two plasmids, one is for experimental group, the other is for a positive control. The experimental plasmid, which is the pT181 attenuator in this experience, contains the antisense sequence downstream of a constitutive promoter and followed by a double terminator on a high-copy plasmid. Meanwhile, there are also a GFP gene with a ribosome binding site downstream of the pT181 attenuator sense target sequence. The GFP coding sequence is also downstream of a constitutive promoter and followed by a double terminator. The positive control plasmid, which is the blank in this experience, contains the same as the experimental plasmid except for the antisense sequence.
We did a group of pT181 attenuator expression experiments. First, as a part that needs to show strong inhibition, we should ensure that its inhibitory effect is obvious enough. Therefore, we compared experimental group and positive control group, which is transformed into a normal GFP plasmid. Depending on the GFP expression, we can prove that our work has a high credibility. Additionally, in the group above, three types of flora from InterLab are cultivated for contrast. The aim is to compare the statistics of pT181 attenuator and verified InterLab to find out which repressor level pT181 attenuator is in when put into practical application.
For this group, we transform different plasmids into the E. coli in the tubes and cultivate for hours (37℃, 220RPM). Then we used ELISA plate to detect the change of fluorescence and OD600 over time. What should be noticed is that we set the original flora at OD600=0.05 to guarantee flora proliferating at the same concentration. As the repression of pT181 attenuator attenuator is so powerful that the fluorescence of the experimental group is hard to detect. As a result, to remove LB medium’s fluorescence background, we centrifuge fluid, take out supernatant, add PBS buffer and resuspend before detect.
Fig.1 Characterization of pT181 attenuator in DH5-α E.coli cells. OD600 monitored over time for cell lines incorporating the pT181 attenuator in the absence or presence of the pT181 antisense. The result shows that"
UChicago,2013,Team:UChicago#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," we don't set it up it's not a big deal, since cut vector with ligase will just show the total background due to uncut vector and vector recircularization.
insert ONLY WITH ligase: checks for contamination of intact plasmid in ligation or transformation reagents
expect no colonies, since if there are colonies it indicates contamination of intact plasmid carrying antibiotic resistance in reagents since only the insert was used which should not be able to recircularize into a construct which can be transformed
this control is optional, but if we are concerned about contamination of reagents with plasmids this could help, so I think we should do it if there is extra insert
More info on control ligation experiments can be found here .
Analysis of yesterday’s Agarose gel of digested RFP in lane 4:
the fragment is about 2 kb long
The BBa_E1010 insert (RFP) is 706bp long, while the vector is 2070 bp long.
It seems like we have our vector present (the approximately 2kb band in lane 4) but not our insert.
To check if the BioBrick actually has RFP, plate E. coli with the plasmid with IPTG.
After checking the kit again, we realized that the BioBrick we isolated from plate 3 well 6G is BBa_R0080, not BBa_E1010.
The insert in BBa_R0080 is 149 bp, which explains why we couldn’t see it on the gel because it was run off.

After speeches from Dr K. Vavitsas (An                                                 Introduction to Synthetic Biology) and                                                 Professor Emeritus Fr. Kolisis (Systems and                                                 Synthetic Biotechnology), iGEM Thessaloniki,                                                 iGEM Athens and iGEM Greece (2017) presented                                                 their projects to the audience. When the                                                 presentations were over, Yvoni (iGEM                                                 Thessaloniki) and Giannis (iGEM Athens) spoke                                                 about the applications of engineering                                                 principles in synthetic biology and explained                                                 the use of some basic synthetic biology tools                                                 (e.g. toggle switch, oscillator, riboswitch) in                                                 order for the participants to be able to use                                                 them in their brainstorming sessions. Leda                                                 (iGEM Athens) talked about the safety                                                 precautions and evaluation process that a                                                 project should pass in order to be considered                                                 safe.
The students were then divided into subgroups                                                 and participated in a brainstorming session in                                                 order to solve real world problems using synthetic biology circuits, with help from                                                 members of iGEM teams. Finally, they managed to                                                 come up with innovative ways to tackle problems                                                 such as wound healing, forest restoration and                                                 infant food allergies. In the end, the                                                 participants presented the ideas they had come                                                 up with and before leaving they were asked to                                                 fill in a short questionnaire regarding their                                                 experience in the workshop.
Thessaloniki - 26/5/2018
Students of the faculty of Pharmacy, AUTH,                                                 invited us to the Pharmacology Club where we                                                 gave a speech about Synthetic Biology and its                                                 contribution in Health Sciences and                                                 Pharmacology. We spoke to them about the                                                 production of artemisinin, an antimalarial                                                 pharmaceutical compound, from yeast and                                                 explained the advantages of this method of                                                 production compared to the traditional                                                 isolation of artemisinin from the                                                 pharmaceutical plant. We, also, gave them                                                 examples of iGEM Projects in the diagnostics                                                 and therapeutics tracks.

Collaboration
It has just been the second year for NTU_Taida to participate in iGEM, therefore we have been enjoying cooperation with iGEM teams in our country.
With NYMU
We asked NYMU_Taipei to test functional results of our biosensor ACE &CEA (BBa_K1157020 & BBa_K1157021 ). They use ELISA plate reader to read the GFP intensity through time. On the other hand, we tested NYMU_Taipei team’s promoter (BBa_K1104242)activity expressed in bacterial strain E. Coli M1655. (See results/protocals for further details)
Apart from functional assay testing, we also discussed about optimizing our functional results. We shared our opinions about data collection time intervals and incubation conditions. We concluded that 8-hour functional tests are better than 4-hour functional tests, but there will be no obvious difference as soon as fluorescence reaches intensity plateau.
With NTU_Taiwan
As a new member of igem, NTU_Taiwan has been a helpful partner to cooperate with. They supported us with our construct of pConst-RBS-CinR-tt (though we weren’t able to submit that part in time) and we supported them for functional testing.
We performed western blotting to test the protein expression level of pRS424-Gal1 SrUCP-TAP (experimental group) and pRS424-Gal1 TAP (control group)."
TU-Eindhoven,2013,Team:TU-Eindhoven#PublicSafety_-_-_TEXT.html,"psis. Even though mutations are unlikely to occur, it is still important issue consider. Therefore different types of safety locks should added to the device.
At the stage where our project is currently at, no extra features are needed to ensure safety, our bacteria can be easily eliminated using ethanol and they are not yet used in humans and animals. However we are aware that the following stages would involve adding two main types of safety locks. Considering that we intend to use the CEST protein producing bacteria to generate a CEST contrast agent to be used in humans and animals, it is necessary to take into account that the outer membrane layer of the bacteria must be modified to avoid activating an immune system response. Moreover a killing mechanism must be implemented in order to eliminate the bacteria from the organism after their purpose has been fulfilled.  The following paragraphs give a detailed explanation of these two elements that must be added to our bacteria in further stages to ensure that no safety issues arise from our project in the future.
In what refers to the mechanism to avoid the immune system , the bacteria should be altered so that they have a carbohydrate surface layer instead of chains. By applying this modification to the bacteria, they will be disguised and invisible to the immune system, allowing them to move forward into the hypoxic region.
The killing mechanism that we propose is the Thymidine kinase/Ganciclovir system, studied and used by previous iGEM teams as well as in researches found in the literature. KillMecID. Dey and G.R.D.

Brazil: Amazonas_Brazil and USP-Brazil Teams
The Amazonas Brazil Team had problems with the LUDOX solution during the InterLab experiments and ran out of it, so we sent them a sample and helped them completing their participation in the InterLab.
The Brazilian teams also collaborated in many aspects through a WhatsApp group. There, we discussed and helped each other with wet-lab issues and discussed doubts about the iGEM deliverables. Since it’s our team’s first time in iGEM, the group helped us a lot in getting some information about how to do a lot of things! We also had a Brazilian meetup early this year where we got in touch with Amazonas_Brazil, USP-Brazil, teams from the previous years and groups interested in participating in iGEM next years. To learn more about the Brazilian Meet-up see the page on the USP-Brazil Team, here.

USA: Harvard Team
We collaborated with the Harvard Team by creating a Global Perspective Outreach Survey about biomanufacturing. This survey was intended to standardize the way teams reach out to experts and authorities related to their projects and how the information is documented. Also, a goal from this collaboration was to understand the gap between academia and industry, the level of public knowledgement about biomanufacturing and the main challenges to push foward the development of biomanufacturing in the world.
Our team created a few questions for the survey that would be asked to the general public, academics, industries, politicians and regulatory agencies. After we created the questions, all participating teams gave their opinions and Harvard Team compiled the best ones and we began to spread the survey and get the data. In this work we have also collaborated with Linkoping , Aalto-Helsink and Hamburg Teams .
Our team has collaborated creating the questions below:
To academics:
How do you think your research could contribute to the advance in biomanufacturing in your country/region?
Do you consider easy to be in contact with the industry and have a research the benefits both, done together?
To industries:
Are you interested in work with universities to develop a biomanufacturing process that benefits you or"

Using these criteria, we designed 10 mutant cages for PCquad and 3 mutant cages for O3-33.
2. The second step of the project is protein expression and verification of cage formation. We attempted expression of five of our best PCquad designs and all three of our O3-33 designs. Expression was done using standard expression protocols and purification was done using his -tag nickel column purification while cage formation was verified using Dynamic Light Scattering.
Dynamic light scattering is used to determine the approximate size and polydispersity of small particles in solution. A beam of light is shown through the sample and the fluctuations in the light due to the movement of the small particles is measured. DLS is dependent on size to the fourth order so it is very important to filter out any large particles such as dust before conducting the experiment.
In our experiment, DLS was used to determine whether or not our protein cages formed as well as the purity of our samples. A radius around 8 nm for PCQuad (WT +mutants) and a radius around 6.5 nm for O3-33 (WT + mutants) as well as a polydispersity below 30%, indicated by DLS meant a pure sample.
3. The final step of the project involved testing our successfully formed mutant cages for disassembly in the presence of Thrombin protease. The mutant cages that had successfully formed cages were treated to Thrombin protease at various concentrations and durations. Disassembly of cage was verified using a combination of SDS page to see if the individual subunits cut at the locations of the cleavage site insert and DLS to see if the entire cage structure fell apart.
General Protocol
60 uL 0.2 mg/ml protein cage samples used for thrombin assay
For each protein cage tested, a sample was subject to thrombin while another was not
Added 1.25 uL of 460 units/ml bovine thrombin stock to each sample (0.69 units) to each sample that was to be subject to thrombin every 4 for hours for 16 hours
An SDS-PAGE gel was run to assay for cleavage and a DLS test was conducted to assay for protein cage disassembly

Collaborations have been one of the greatest parts of iGEM, it was amazing to meet lovers of the science from all over the world, share whit them and make contacts. It was wonderful to hear all the ideas of their projects and share our idea too.
As newbies, we asked many questions and all the teams were always willing to answer, thank you very much. We shared whit teams from Mexico, Estonia, España, Chile and we participated in the MeetUp Latinametica. Below are the different iGEM teams that have collaborated with us.
ESTONIA
The iGEM team from Tartu Estonia, is working in the  production of mycosporine-like amino acids, UV  radiation protection compounds, in yeast using the genes from two different  cyanobacterial species. This compounds work not only as sunscreen but also are  able to protect skin from photoaging, have the anti-inflammatory effect and  antioxidant activity and even could be considered as anti-cancer agents.
As Ecuador is located on the equatorial line or parallel 0 °, is subjected to extremely high UV radiation indices, especially in the Andean area. In our country, there are constant campaigns to prevent skin cancer and protection against intense radiation.
In the meetings with the iGEM team from Tartu we talked about the importance of your project and how it would benefit tropical countries like ours. We also comment on experiences on how the sunscreens contain chemical compounds which are extremely toxic to the oceans and the environment.

In comparison, another transformation was implemented, using TOP10 chemo competent cells to investigate the effect of MP1 as a non-transformable plasmid. Furthermore, pSB1C3 plasmid was also used for transformation to test the general competence of the electrocompetent S1030 cells. A last, a transformation using only 1 ng of MP1 DNA was implemented under equivalent conditions with S1030 cells.

Preparation of Davis Rich Medium for transformation of MP1 in S1030
Davis Rich Medium (DRM) was used in all PACE papers for transformations as well as the PACE device itself. Therefore, using DRM should be of any great advantage against using normal media like LB, 2xYT or simple Esvelt medium. For preparation of DRM, the amounts of different chemicals was mixed according to the methods of the “Negative selection and stringency modulation in phage-assisted continuous evolution” (Carlson et al., 2014). The amounts were adjusted to 1 l medium instead of 20 l. 10 mM of 50 ml Borsäure and Coppersulfat were prepared using the appropriate amounts calculated using the molecular weights.

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html,". Embedding method is the most common one to realize bacterial immobilization. Immobilizing living bacteria in carrier like sodium alginate, cellulose and agar, etc., increases the density and survival time of them, as well as reduces the flow of bacteria into natural environment. Our team produces immobilized E. coli by embedding the sensor bacteria in polyvinyl alcohol/sodium alginate (PVA/SA) beads.(UCAS-APPLICATION-DESIGN-1)
We planned to breed our immobilized bacteria in fish pond water, but as our analysis of fish pond water shows, in nutrition in fish pond water is limited and cannot meet the demand of our engineered bacteria. Therefore, we changed our plan and decided to breed bacteria in our nitrogen limited M9 culture medium, mixed with fish pond water. Nevertheless, our technique in immobilization might have further use since we are still seeking for a better solution.
Pumping System
The equipment contains a detection system, a pumping system, a control system and a battery. In order to properly inject water, a peristaltic pump is employed to inject 1.5mL pool water into the detecting cell, and another pump will pump it out once the detection process finishes. The second pump delivers the water to a cup and, considering the potential danger of escaping bacteria, a microporous filter at the top of the cup.
Detection System
Detection part mainly consists of a detecting cell, a LED and a photoresistor. In our first plan, we planned to applied bacterial immobilizing technique. Firstly the polyvinyl alcohol/sodium alginate (PVA/SA) beads with immobilized E. coli soak in the water in the detecting cell for approximately 5 hours. Thus the promoter begins to respond to the concentration of nitrogen, and then RFP gene is expressed if the concentration is below the threshold. A 585nm-595nm LED is applied to excite red fluorescence and a photoresistor are used to detect the fluorescence. The detecting cell is the only consumable item in the whole equipment. In our second plan, we will breed our bacteria in nitrogen limited M9 culture medium for approximately 5 hours, then inject the fish pond water to mix with the culture medium. It will take 2-3 hours before the GFP being expressed and detected.
Control System
To ensure that the hardware perform properly, a control system was designed. We used a small circuit board to control the relays and the Bluetooth module. The relays’ opening or closure makes different parts in the equipment start or stop working at proper time. And the Bluetooth module sends the"

Background
Nowadays, most disease-diagnosing methods are confined to specific delicate testing apparatus, which are expensive, time-consuming and low sensitivity. The study of Point-of-care testing (POCT), also called bedside testing (with the definition of medical diagnostic testing at or near the time and place of patient care), has become very heated because of its convenience, simplicity and highly efficiency. Internet of things (IoT) is the network of physical devices, vehicles, home appliances, and other items embedded with electronics, software, sensors, actuators, and connectivity which enables the connection and exchange of data.
Here we came up with a design. We combined the idea of our project Aptamer-based Cell-free Detection system (ABCD system), IoT, and the above concept of POCT so as to develop a microfluidic device, which is small while convenient for real-time detection of cancer.
Given that the biomarkers of different cancers are overlapping and the time was limited, we just took the pancreatic cancer as an example to certify the feasibility of our testing theory as well as our device.

2. Product Concept
The Problem
Recent advances in the $6.4 billion synthetic biology field have dramatically increased the potential of synthetic biology technologies to transform our world. We can now use our biological understanding to create products that solve some of the biggest challenges the world faces. We have adopted a strong lean methodology to identify that these advances have also lead to a currently poorly met need for a new set of accessible computational tools that enable the synthetic biologist to quickly and collaboratively design and test DNA circuitry.
Through extensive interviews with the synthetic biology community, we have sought to verify every one of our business hypothesis to generate evidence-based identification of the pains of each our customer segments and the value propositions that they care most about. By talking to 69 iGEM teams, 7 synthetic biology startups, the UK’s world leading synthetic biology labs and a major world pharmaceutical R&D lab, we have been able to identify the key pain points in the work flow of synthetic biology users. This has informed and shaped our continuously changing business model canvas, the staple tool of all startups in search of a viable and scalable business model.
The three key pains of most of our customer segments within the synthetic biology community are that (1) the design of gene parts is complex because collaboration between and within teams is difficult and thought processes are lost; (2) exchange of gene circuit parts is messy, as you have to individually track and hunt down the person who created it and (3) individuals have to have an advanced understanding of programming languages to use automated labs. Our customer interviews, moreover, elucidated nuances in the pains felt by our customer segments: while most of our customers would benefit from easier access to automated cloud labs to reduced labour costs and the time taken to run manual experiments, some of customers, and arguably our most important customers in terms of purchasing power, would not benefit from this due to worries over intellectual property and trade secrets. From talks with a major pharmaceutical and biotech company, we also identified a fourth pain point, (4) the need for notifications about patented sequences and readily available information about part combinations.
Our Solution
We have therefore founded Alphabrick, a software tool interfacing automated cloud labs, for the design, exchange, and creation of synthetic gene constructs. Our software platform solution, www.alphabrick.bio,  originated at the UK’s first 72 hour biohackathon at which it won first place.

Consequently, we can determine the specificity with which the proteins bind and how they might respond to DNA not belonging to enterohemorrhagic E. coli. This will help us define how specific we expect our final system to be.
When we sequenced TALE B ( BBa_K782006 ), we discovered that it had a small mutated segment. We expected a sequence of AGCAATGGG in the repeat variable di-residue of the second repeat. However, the sequence was actually TCCCACGAC. This meant that the required target sequence at this position was a C, and not a T, as the parts registry web page indicates.  The two TALEs also had a Kozak sequence at the front of the sequence which blocked expression in E. coli as shown in Figure 13.  We removed the Kozak sequence before using TALE A and TALE B to construct BBa_K1189000 and BBa_K1189001 respectively.
Since, our system uses two TALEs we made a plasmid containing both TALE A and B target site annotated [A] and [B] respectively with some non specific nucleotides in between, such that the distance between [A] and [B] is similar to the same distance between the two target sites of the TALEs we engineered for EHEC detection (appx. 200bp).
We also incorporated TALE A ( BBa_K782004 ) and TALE B ( BBa_K782006 ) in our other constructs. We synthesized TALE A and TALE B with a K coil under a IPTG inducible promoter. The K coil binds to E coil, its binding partner in vitro which is fused to our Prussian blue reporter.
As a back up plan, we considered using β-lactamase as a reporter. Therefore, we synthesized TALE A linked to β-lactamase ( BBa_K1189031 ). In all of TALE-A bound to the K-coil under a LacI promoter( BBa_K1189029 ), TALE-B bound to the K-coil under a LacI promoter ( BBa_K1189030 ), and TALE-A bound to a β-lactamase under a LacI promoter ( BBa_K1189031 ) we tried to further improve the TALEs, so that they are more useful to us and the general iGEM community, by codon"

Figure 1: Schematic illustration of the general microbial fuel cell functional principle, showing the flow of charged species during operation.
To determine how well the different BioBricks we create really work in the designated environment, the design and construction of a suitable microbial fuel cell is necessary. This fuel cell has to meet several requirements. As explained previously it should consist of two chambers, separated by a material that is only traversable for cations. Both chambers have to contain an electrically conductive electrode. Also, they should have a large surface area, in order to allow contact to a high number of electron donors at the same time. Both the anode and the cathode chamber also have to be air-tight, since the reaction has to take place under anaerobic conditions. For obvious reasons, we aim at keeping the costs for the cell low by using materials which cost as little as possible while still performing well.
Construction of a first prototype began in May. After initial testing, the design underwent significant changes over the course of the project. Important stages of this process are shown below, along with a description of their design and the flaws that led to the planning of a new model.

Conclusions
Conjugation System
A key aspect of this project is the conjugation system which allows the signal plasmid to be transmitted from cell to cell. A thorough design plan was drafted and we set about building our communication system in the lab. Performing the necessary knockouts proved to be a difficult task. Three different knockout attempts were made using the λ-red system without any success. The exact reason for this remains unclear. Although we were unable to successfully knockout the required genes from the R751 conjugative plasmid, progress was made with the signal plasmid. Despite the fact that we did not have access to R751 ΔoriTR cells, we were able to show that our prototype signal plasmid is transmitted in the presence of wild R751. This plasmid should provide a useful tool for future teams wishing to use the R751 system. Another success was the synthesis and characterization of the trbK entry exclusion protein. Conjugation tests showed that this was able to block incoming conjugative transfers, as predicted.
Self Destructive Plasmid
The goal of the Self Destructive Plasmid subproject was to create a plasmid that could be induced to destruct itself. It would do so by expressing an endonuclease that would recognise and cut a sequence in the same plasmid. This linearised DNA was expected to be automatically degraded by the cell.
The final goal of self destruction was not reached. However, a 30 basepair I-SceI homing endonuclease restriction site has been biobricked and shown to be restricted by that endonuclease. It has been combined with an inducible GFP-LVA reporter gene, which has also been shown to work.
The problem is the I-SceI homing endonuclease. First a part from the registry was used, that turned out to be T4 DNA ligase instead of I-SceI homing endonuclease. Construction of this part was done by assembling more basic parts. But the gene for the I-SceI"

This was used in an attempt to compensate for the fact that the peak at 560nm (Orange) in MOrange/luciferase fusion spectrum is lower than the one at 490 nm (Blue). Even though we did not manage to test the latter with transformed bacteria, the data collected in all the previous experiments makes us confident that the instrumentation is at least adequately functional.
Sensor data for different colours at different intensities
As the major part of the instrumentation, the bio-electronic interface, had been made and tested, now we turned to testing the other parts of our deveoped kit. This included the mechanical chassis of the prototype, the electronic/mechatronic (sensory and motory) components, and of course the software. The overview of the finished hardware/software can be seen in our Intstrumentation (Biologger) page . Below, the videos showing our instrumentation in action can be seen.
Sporage and Distribution
Please find detailed explanations of this part of the project on our Sporulation and Germination main page and on our Design Process page The graph below shows the percentage of spores (strain PS3411) counted in a sample of culture that were pipetted onto germination medium containing agarose pads. The graph shows the spores germinating over time.
Percentage of spores in samples counted at different times after addition to germination medium agarose pads
The images below show a time lapse taken using DIC microscopy from which the time point values were calculated. Using excel's exponential line fitting, the half life of these spores is calculated to be 5000 seconds (83 minutes). This is much slower than was hoped. However, we were unable to replicate the conditions used by Prof. Setlow in the papers linked on the attributions page due to limitations of equipment in our lab (e.g. no access to a mounted stage or difco sporulation medium).
Furthermore, we were unsuccessful (three times!) in making spores from the wild type Bacillus 168 strain and are unable to explain this. Therefore we haven't provided comparative data to prove that there is an increase in germination rate when the fast promoter is swapped in.
In the following microscopy images and animation, spores show up as phase-bright spots whereas vegetative cells are dark.
Over time there is seen a reduction in the number of light spots indicating the spores are germinating"

Connect With Industry_ Visiting Cheng Loong Paper Company
Cheng Loong Paper Company is one of the biggest paper company in Taiwan, so we contacted them and hoped to understand how our design can be applied in paper industry. During the visit, we had clarified three things_ First, the chemical pollution used to deink cause water pollution, and the company wanted to remove the use of chemicals due to the high cost of sewage treatment. Second, the strength of fiber is according to the length of it, therefore, reduce the opportunity of the contact between fibers and deinking agents preserve strength. Third, the cost of white paper produced by our device is higher than current method.
According to our discoveries, Cheng Loong suggested us to focus on preserving fibers. And due to low light penetration in paper pulp, we decided to deink paper before cutting it into paper pulp. Thus, we constructed a new deinking process which can specifically deink and hoped to preserver more fibers. Through the visiting, we understood the need and lack of factories, and tried to adjust our design to make it more practical for industry.
Contact 2012 TU Munich iGEM team for biobricks improvement
In the last design of our project, we contacted 2012 TU Munich to learn about their red light induced system biobricks. Through meetings, we gradually understand their original design. We appreciate 2012 TU Munich for giving us many advices of how we improve the biobricks. Lastly, we optimize the protein codon and reverse the direction of protein expression.

Plasmids, Promoter, resistance
Usually, a big hurdle when changing your chassis organism is a very basic question: Will my constructs still work? Do I need different
ori
? Do I have to redesign everything from scratch? Fortunately, the most commonly used origins of replication, ColE1, p15A and pMB1 are maintained just fine in V. natriegens (Weinstock et al. 2016) We could observe some differences in copy number, which we quantified. You can find the corresponding data on our Part collection page. To retrieve these plasmids from the cells, we have tested a wide variety of commercially available kits and found that all of them worked, returning plasmid of the same purity and yield as for E. coli. Promoter commonly used in E. coli also lead to expression in V. natriegens. Expression levels are slightly different, but we also quantified these and you can find the results on our toolbox page. The same goes for other basic genomic parts like terminators and
ribosomal binding sites
.
Commonly, when very high gene expression is needed, for instance in protein overproduction, the phage derived T7 system is used. The T7 phage infects E. coli but it was also successfully inserted into V. natriegens and shown to drive protein expression (Weinstock et al. 2016) One way of generating even stronger, phage derived promoters could be using V. natriegens derived phage expression systems.
Every organism has its unique set of resistances to certain antimicrobial molecules. In order to successfully use a new organism, awareness of its individual tolerances is required to use antibiotics successfully for selection. We could show that chloramphenicol, carbenicillin, tetracycline and kanamycin worked, but at different concentrations from E. coli. We measured the V. natriegens specific concentrations and made them available on our strain engineering page.
Plasmids in absence of a selective pressure were only retained for a short time (Own Data). Curing of plasmids that have no longer a purpose is therefore quick and fairly effortless.

NUS_Singapore,2016,Team:NUS Singapore#Project#Wet Lab_-_-_TEXT.html," the membrane of the cell.
Normally in the cell, hasI, which is a sigma factor, is bound to hasS, which is an anti-sigma factor. This prevents hasI from activating the production of luxR. But when hasR is bound by hasA, this leads to conformational changes that result in the release of hasI by hasS. hasI will then activate luxR production.
CD44 is a cell membrane protein involved in normal cell function (cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesion). However, one notable isoform, CD44v6, seems to play a major role in cancer progression, facilitating cell migration and invasion and is commonly upregulated on the surface of cancer cells. The RIOT system uses CD44v6 as a spatial marker, and recognition of this protein via a CD44v6 specific antibody allows anchoring of the engineered bacteria on the surface, triggering the expression of invasin and LLO for subsequent invasion.
Part III:RIOT Invader
LuxR is under the control of pHas, which get activated via transponder circuit. The production LuxR will then induce the expression of LuxI, invasin, LLO (listeriolysin O) and GFP respectively. There is already a basal level of AHL in the bacteria. Upon LuxI expression, more AHL is produced, thus amplifying the loop of this positive-feedback mechanism.
Invasin helps the bacteria to get into cell endosome while LLO which is a pore-forming toxin will allow the bacteria to escape out of the endosome into cytosol. We use GFP as a marker to locate the bacteria and signal the successful activation of circuit.
BACKGROUND:
Invasin is derived from the bacteria Yersinia pestis which allows selective invasion of cells that express β1-integrins. Listeriolysin O (LLO) on the other hand, is expressed in Listeria monocytogenes and allows the bacteria to break out of the endosome after entry into mammalian cells.  LLO is activated in the low pH enviroment (pH 5.5) of the endosome. Then,  LLO  will forms pores in the membrane of the endosome and results in the lysis of the endosome and the escape of the bacterium into the cytoplasm. Combining the traits of these two genes, our engineered bacteria is capable of entering the cytosol of cancer cells to potentially release a cytotoxic drug.
We aim to make a construct that is activated in the presence of a hasS-hasI complex that is formed"
UCSC,2018,Team:UCSC#Design-N_-_-_TEXT.html," binding of progesterone in the cell. This idea had some problems; the natural binding affinity for these receptors was much too high for our purposes and would result in apoptosis when the cell had accumulated ~0.05% of our target progesterone concentration of 20mg. This concentration is the required dosage for progesterone to suppress ovulation when taken sublingually. Changing the binding affinity of a cell receptor would require a large effort to intelligently design a new receptor or, more likely, a large library of random mutant receptors to screen. This idea was discounted fully after we discovered that the innate activity of the receptor tended to disrupt the apoptosis pathway.
Riboswitch
We still liked the idea of creating a sensor that could inform the consumer when the desired concentration of progesterone was present in the culture. From our mentor, McKenna Hicks, we learned about riboswitches, due to her extensive research and creation of the nucleotide-based sensors. We were informed that the guided mutagenesis process for a protein-based receptor was comparatively more labor-intensive anyways than for the sensors that could be created with riboswitches.
Riboswitches are composed of short sequences of nucleotides made up of an aptamer, which is a ligand-binding domain made up of nucleic acids, and the expression platform that can control gene-regulatory functions. These aptamers can be tested in vitro for progesterone specificity, whereas proteins require synthesis in vivo. A paper by Contreras Jimnenez et al. (2015) described several in vitro-derived aptamers specific for progesterone (Contreras Jimnenez et al., 2015). Unfortunately, like the progesterone receptor, these aptamers are also three orders of magnitude too sensitive for our desired concentration, but have much shorter sequences - an average of 51 bp compared to 933 bp for human progesterone receptor isoform B (hPR-B) (UniProt, n.d.; Verbeke et al., 2013). Mutating these short sequences and isolating variants would be much easier than mutating a larger protein receptor. We found that the systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX) method follows a similar logic to directed evolution, and is intended for selecting RNA aptamers (Ellington and Szostak, 1990).
For these reasons, we looked into the viability of creating a progesterone-specific RNA aptamer that could be used in conjunction with a riboswitch expression platform to affect the expression of a reporter gene. Our research uncovered a previous iGEM BioBr"

GeorgiaTech,2015,Team:GeorgiaTech#Background_-_-_TEXT.html," to use the in vitro selection capabilities presented by phage display to artificially evolve naturally occurring copper-binding proteins into unnatural enzymes that can aid the CuAAC reaction in acquiring copper for catalysis in copper-deficient environments.
Starting Proteins
Our search for an unnatural enzyme began with research on natural copper-binding proteins. Our selection process demanded proteins that were small (less than 80 kDa) in order to be successfully displayed on the pIII coat protein (Russel, Lowman, Clackson, 2004). Additionally, these proteins had to have the ability to bind to either one or two copper(I) ions in order to satisfy the requirements of the CuAAC reaction (Fokin, Worrell, Malik, 2013). We selected the following six proteins: Atx1, CusF, plastocyanin, tyrosinase, Ace1, and the N-terminus domain of MNK. We also worked with three additional tyrosinase homologues which were 80%, 70%, and 70% homologous to wild-type tyrosinase. These homologous genes were necessary for DNA shuffling, as explained below. We hypothesized that using these candidate proteins’ copper binding geometry combined with further CuAAC reaction-specific optimization would allow us to more efficiently search the “protein universe” and generate more diverse libraries; therefore, we would increase our chances of discovering a functional “clickase”.
Protein Library Generation
A fundamental component of our evolution-directed experiment is to generate a library of mutated proteins. After selecting six starting proteins, our next task would be to generate a large number of derivatives with similar but different properties. An ideal mutant would retain the high binding affinity for copper while also being able to exchange copper with an alkyne to trigger the CuAAC reaction. We used two different techniques to generate used our library of mutants: error-prone polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and DNA shuffling.
Natural condition PCR has three main steps: denaturation, annealing, and extension. During denaturation, the reaction mixture (containing DNA, primer, dNTPs, buffer, and DNA polymerase) is heated, allowing the double-stranded DNA to “melt” into single-stranded DNA. Specialized primers anneal to specific sites (usually the beginning and end of the target sequence) on the single stranded “template” DNA in accordance with complementary base pairing. Then Taq polymerase (a heat-resistant DNA polymerase) begins assembling base pairs along the entire template DNA strand, extending it until a complete dsDNA molecule is formed"

After the polyethylene plastic is decomposed by laccase, we plan to use bacteria to uptake the decomposed waste as a carbon source. As such, the second module of this project involves an alkane metabolism pathway, where the chassis organism is Shewanella Oniedensis MR-1, which can generate electricity for our project.
To generate the alkane metabolism pathway, the starting product (alkanes) must penetrate into the cytoplasm through the cell membrane. While short-chain alkanes (less than C12) are able to diffuse directly into the cell, medium to long-chain alkanes cannot due to their increased hydrophobic nature. Since the laccase fragmentizes PE into randomized lengths, it is in our interest to make sure that all ranges of alkane size can be efficiently metabolized within the cytoplasm. To this end, we have to use an outer membrane alkane channel protein to mediate the entry of the medium to long chains alkane.
According to the literature, an outer membrane channel protein called AlkL, encoded by alkL, from Pseudomonas putida GPo1 has been shown to enhance the diffusion efficiency of dodecane (C12) into the cell when expressed in Escherichia coli. It is also shown to be able to facilitate the transport of larger alkanes, which has high hydrophobicity, making it more difficult to pass through the lipopolysaccharide outer membrane of the bacteria. The mechanism behinds AlkL is that it penetrates through the lipopolysaccharide layer, where an extracellular domain with high affinity for hydrophobic molecules lies. After the alkane molecule is collected via this domain, it makes its way through the hydrophobic core of AlkL. This subsequently allows the alkane to makes its way to the cytoplasm via a small lateral opening of AlkL. From there, the alkane may make its way to the cytoplasm. The outer membrane alkane channel protein(AlkL) we plan to use"

The consensus sequences were run through the Conserved Domain Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (CD BLAST) to identify conserved domains within the open reading frame of the Gag and Pol polyproteins. The consensus sequences were further analyzed using publicly accessible protein modification servers to identify conserved modifications of the polyproteins. Covalent protein modifications were scanned for using ProtParam (Gasteiger et al., 2005), MyHits Motif Scan (SIB, Switzerland), and PlantsP, (Podell and Gibskov, 2004). Nuclear localization signals were scanned for using NLStradamus (Nguyen et al., 2009), NucPred (Stockholm Bioinformatics Center, Sweden), cNLS Mapper (Kosugi et al., 2009), WoLF PSORT (CBRC, Japan), and SeqNLS (Lin et al., 2012). These conserved domains were annotated on the consensus sequences using Geneious (Biomatters, Newark, NJ 07102, USA) and an alignment was generated using MUSCLE (EMBL-EBI, England).
Making inferences from previous studies investigating the cleavage specificity of the aspartyl-like proteases of retroviruses, we predicted putative cleavage sites along the CR polyproteins. These studies found that in most cases, aspartyl-like proteases cut substrates at the bond between two adjacent hydrophobic amino acids (Toszer, 2010; Laco, 2015). We scanned through the consensus sequences and noted sites meeting the criteria for adjacent hydrophobic residues. We additionally considered the covalent modifications that have been reported in specific domains. We identified three putative cleavage sits between the Gag and Protease domains, eight between the Protease and Reverse Transcript"

Waterloo,2016,Team:Waterloo#Integrated Practices#OpenScience_-_-_TEXT.html,"disciplines in biology each have a different classification within big science. These disciplines often publish data and discoveries in different manners that can vary by researcher and sub-discipline  (Borgman, 2015).  For instance, data in ecology will be collected and analyzed in markedly different ways, even within ecology a researcher studying larger effects of climate change on a specific ecosystem would have different data practices than a frog reproduction researcher.  In order to develop scientific explanations,  standardized forms of data analysis and collection exist throughout the many subdisciplines of biology. Yet there are still many fields in biology that are much smaller, with more individualized projects, that are small science. Some of these fields  are emerging to have more standardized elements of data collection and data storage that is moving them towards big science (Müller & Arndt, 2012; Price, 1986). These fields will also have dynamic characteristics and requirements when oriented to openness.
One of these evolving sub-disciplines is synthetic biology.  Synthetic biology utilizes the power of genome modification and protein synthesis to create new systems in cells that can change the functionality of the cell. Scientometric analysis by Paul Oldham, a British analyst, reveals the development and divergence of synthetic biology with respect to terms used in the Web of Science, an international data and publication repository. The term synthetic biology is mentioned for the first time by a French scientist in 1912 but then remains dormant until the early 2000s, and not until 2007 are there many citations in the field (Leduc, 1912; Oldham, Hall, & Burton, 2012; Zeleny & Hufford, 1992). Even with the increase in citations in synthetic biology, in 2007 there are just over 200 articles, significantly fewer than other developing fields such as nanotechnology. The analysis also shows the global nature of the discipline, with researchers scattered across the globe (Oldham et al., 2012). However, with the development of data repositories, increased research interest, and standardization, synthetic biology is developing many characteristics of a big science (Borgman, 2015; Endy, 2005). As such it forms a crucial case-study in evolving data methods in an emerging science.
The overall objective of synthetic biology is the engineering of complex biological systems which create novel cell functions such as protein synthesis (Osbourn, O’Maille, Rosser, & Lindsey, 2012; Shetty, Endy, & Jr, 2008). The approach of synthetic biologists typically proceeds"

INSA-Lyon,2014,Team:INSA-Lyon#insa_-_-_TEXT.html," 1, I'm back for a fourth year of iGEM ! This time as an instructor, I'm excited to see entirely new aspects of an iGEM project, and experimenting teaching in an unusual and rather unique way.
Apart from iGEM, I'm preparing a thesis on the regulation of the virulence of the phytopathogen Dickeya dadantii. You know, complex stuff involving 5 different proteins, 2 promoters and DNA supercoiling acting simultaneously on a single gene... Still, I hope my experience with genetic regulation, reporters and data analysis prove useful to the team.

Pharmacist and graduated in Systems and Synthetic Biology, my first experience with the iGEM competition was in 2013 in Evry where we designed iron-chelating bacteria as an alternative treament to hemochromatosis. The experience was intense, albeit very addictive. Since I'm back in my hometown, I'm doing this all over again but this time as a supervisor at the INSA-Lyon. My favorite experience so far is teasing Juliette Paillet and testing her mental toughness through the summer.

Programmed drug delivery with LLO
  Listeria monocytogenes is a bacterial pathogen that replicates in the cytosol of mammalian cells. The pathogen is initially internalized in host phagosomes, then lyses them to obtain access to the cytosol. A single gene, LLO, is responsible for this activity and is sufficient to convey the phenotype to E. coli.
The LLO protein is activated by the low pH of the lysosme. By forming large pores in the lysosomal membrane, it allows protein delivery to the cytosol of macrophages (Higgins et al. 1999). Using E. coli as a protein vector means we don't need to isolate and purify the TDMH enzyme.
We hypothesized that a bacterial delivery system could be efficient and specific in targeting mycobacterial-infected macrophages. In effect, we might take advantage of the natural tendency of macrophages to phagocytose E. coli and their enzymatic payload.
Because LLO expression is known to be associated with Listeria pathogenicity, we took extra precautions in our cloning and experiments. These measures are detailed on our team safety page. Briefly, we worked in a Biosafety Level 2 lab under the supervision of two full-time lab managers. We researched and complied with French national and insitutional biosafety rules as they apply to this gene.
Figure 5 Experimental design of the killing assay inside the macrophages. We infected them with M. smegmatis and washed after 1 hour. Then, we infected them with E. coli and washed after 1 hour. The end of this final infection step refers to the time 0 on our graphs. At this time we started the observation under the microscope
E. coli and M. smegmatis coinfections
  Figure 6 displays J774 macrophages one hour after coinfection with E. coli and M. smegmatis. As described in the methods, the E. coli express TDMH and LLO and fluorescent mRFP as a label. The M. smegmatis express GFP as a label, but are otherwise wild type.
The two movies displayed in figure 7 are time-lapse microscopy of live coinfected macrophages collected over a period of 6 hours. Fluorescence patterns revealing the localization of E. coli and M. smegmatis within the macrophages are relatively stable over this time period.
We next applied quantitative microscopy to characterize the behavior of our system inside live"

Tol/Pal accumulates at the basis of nascent blebs
The value of the Laplacian operators used to model Tol and Pal diffusions in the membranes (see equations above) depends on the membrane curvature: in non-flat membranes, the ""efficiency"" of the diffusion depends on the direction. In fact, molecules anchored in the outer membrane, like Pal, diffuse less efficiently in regions of negative curvature, and consequently tend to accumulate in these regions.
Using our computer program, we have been able to experimentally demonstrate this accumulation. The bottom plot presents the accumulation of Pal proteins in the membrane represented on the top plot. In the bottom plot, the left/right axis represents coordinates along the membrane, whereas the other horizontal axis represent the time evolution of protein concentrations (from time 70 to 100, instead of from 0 to 25 as indicated) One can show the protein accumulation at coordinates 11 and 43 approximately, corresponding to the regions of negative curvature of the membrane.
This result is corroborated by recent experimental findings showing that “negative membrane curvatures [act] as a cue for sub-cellular localization of a bacterial protein” [ 7 ].
Most notably, we can thus assume that Pal molecules accumulate at the basis of blebs. This naturally leads to an increase of Tol-Pal complexes formation in these regions. Lastly, because we additionally assumed that these large complexes diffuse less efficiently than Tol and Pal alone, we finally obtain that Tol-Pal complexes accumulate at the basis of the blebs. This is depicted in the following picture.
Rings of accumulated Tol/Pal constricts blebs basis
As explained above, Tol-Pal complexes tend to accumulate at the basis of the blebs, creating a ring of Tol-Pal (if seen from above).
When Tol-Pal molecules move to the interior of the ring, due to Brownian motion, they narrow the two membranes because they impose to have a constant distance between the two membranes as explained in the picture below: the proteins act like zippers on membranes, as depicted below. This leads to vesicle formation.

Fig. 1 PCR amplification of ICA 9-mer. This time, the results are much cleaner than the one from 7/13/2015 . The anticipated product corresponding to a successful 9-mer is 1018 bp.
It seems that we are able to get ICA to work properly.
While the accessory bands are still present to some degree, the major product is our desired 9-mer.
We still do not know if the accessory bands are an artifact of PCR or ICA.
It seems that a 1:100 dilution of the crude eluate does not provide sufficient template for amplification.
Gel Purification
The bands corresponding to the 9-mer were excised, then gel extracted using qiagen kit.

Safety
The projects that are made possible by iGEM are incredible in their variety and potential. While some make their bacteria smell like bananas , others have worked on astrobiology, laying down the foundations for creating micro-organisms that can tolerate the extreme conditions of space . Others yet are inventing new ways to combat real world diseases or energy problems . What needs to be remembered is that even the banana project raises safety issues, for example the possible dissemination of genetically modified organisms in the environment. This dissemination is something that is required by the other projects mentioned above, if they were ever used in an industrial context, away from their origins in tightly controlled research environments.
This is why safety considerations and an analysis of consequences need to be taken into account, should biological material from the lab be released into the environment. In the case of our project, we analyse each individual part in terms of safety issues and try to imagine how they could interact with the environment if they should ever be accidentally or intentionally released.
KillerRed
When working with proteins like KillerRed , one can quickly raise safety issues. We have been contacted by the ATOMS-Turkiye iGEM team on the possible toxicity of KillerRed, for example. This shows why it is particularly important to study possible risks arising from use of new parts like this protein.
The ATOMS-Turkiye iGEM team believe that communication about safety issues can improve overall safety levels in synthetic biology"

Mathematical models and computer simulations provide a great way to describe the function and operation of BioBrick Parts and Devices. Synthetic Biology is an engineering discipline, and part of engineering is simulation and modeling to determine the behavior of your design before you build it. Designing and simulating can be iterated many times in a computer before moving to the lab. This award is for teams who build a model of their system and use it to inform system design or simulate expected behavior in conjunction with experiments in the wetlab.

Country Profile
Synthetic biology is a relatively new and rapidly growing research field that is considered to hold significant technological potential. As it involves the design and production of biological systems not present in the natural world, synthetic biology resembles an engineering application of biological sciences. Development up to now has mostly been centered in the West, in countries such as the United States and the United Kingdom, with Japan being East Asia’s one of the early adopters.In more recent years, other East Asian countries have begun to participate on the international synthetic biology stage. But in comparison to western countries, synthetic biology in East Asian countries is still in its infancy. The result is a disparity in information available to the public about synthetic biology developments in these respective regions.
In the interests of amending this situation, we present this document as a reference for progress in synthetic biology in the four East Asian countries/regions and one South East Asian country: Hong Kong, China, South Korea, Japan, and Indonesia. It includes investigations into research achievements, public perception, regulations and funding that we conducted using local online search engines and our native languages that will hopefully provide with the inside story.

Evry,2012,Team:Evry#GB_-_-_TEXT.html," modifications, which noticeably reduce the probability of having a mutation at the ligation scar.
If these new techniques dramatically speed-up the assembly of DNA pieces, to our knowledge, no reported work has been carried on standardizing these methodologies. So far, biologists using Golden Gate engineer new overhangs and create a new library each time they are making a different construct.
From Golden Gate and BioBricks to GoldenBricks
The BioBricks are a collection of parts that can be assembled one by one in a generic way. Golden Gate is a technique that enable the assembly of several tens of parts simultaneously. Taking inpiration from both technique, the 2012 Evry iGEM Team invented and developped a new methodology called GoldenBricks, merging the power of the two techniques while keeping the compatibility toward the old RFC 10 BioBrick format and preserving the possiblilty to make standard GoldenGate assembly simultaneously with GoldenBrick assembly, using the same vectors.
GoldenBricks technique is a one-shot cassette construction using DNA parts coming either from a plasmid distribution or from PCR product, engaging 5, 7 and possibly more different parts. Moreover, GoldenBricks works for both eukaryotes and procaryotes DNA construction with the very same protocol. If a non classical assembly is required (as for testing the strength of a terminator) a new ""split construction"" method based on standard plasmids make possible to assemble parts in a non classical way.
Perspectives
Such technique offers great perspectives for the future of iGEM and of the PartsRegistry in general. First, it would make possible the fast and simple assembly of complete cassettes using less expensive equipment, less toxic chemical and less sequencing runs than the BioBrick assembly. Second, it would make fast and efficient cloning accessible for both researchers as well as for less experimented users, such as high school iGEMers or biohackers thanks to the simplicity of its protocol. Third, the creation of large expression cassettes using this method is cheaper and faster than synthesizing the construct at the present day, which would guaranty the interest for a DNA database compared to de novo synthesis for the years to come. And last, this method is a lot more easy to automatize unlike the RFC 10 biobrick format.
Theory
Requirements for the development of the new standard
In the continuation of what we wrote previously and in order to stay in the progression of the methodology we have tried in this work to stay as close as possible to the biobrick format, to keep GoldenBrick parts compatible with the RFC"
Uppsala,2015,Team:Uppsala#Results enz_-_-_TEXT.html,"1. After incubation of the transformed cells on agar plates with chloramphenicol overnight, colonies had appeared on the plates with dioxygenase and CueO. The RFC did however not seem to work for the CotA. The colonies were screened using colony PCR and the result from this PCR is shown in Figure 3. The results shown in this figure indicates that the RFC was successful for both the catechol 1,2 dioxygenase and the CueO.
Figure 3: Agarose gel with PCR product from colony PCR of RFC product from the second PCR. Well 5 contains dioxygenase without the HlyA-tag attached and well 4 contains the RFC product which should have the HlyA-tag attached. The band in well 5 has moved further than the band in well 4 which shows that the PCR product in well 4 is longer than the product in well 5. Well 2 and 3 contains CueO with and without the HlyA-tag respectively. There is a difference in length between these two bands as well and this shows that the RFC was successful also for CueO.
Samples were sent for Sanger sequencing to SciLifeLab in Uppsala to confirm correct assembly of the HlyA-tag. Results showed that a 2 base frameshift in the coding sequence was introduced due to faulty primer design. This resulted in incorrect expression of the export tag, which made the tag useless.

Introduction
Requirements
Implementation
Our project started with the observation that chemical contamination of surface water is an increasingly important problem. We felt that a biobased sensor would offer excellent opportunities for detection of such contaminants, and identified the bacterial chemotaxis pathway as the best point of entry to engineer a flexible and sensitive sensor. Below, we describe the design and implementation of our project.
Overview
The goal of our project is to engineer the chemotaxis pathway of the bacterium Escherichia coli to emit a visible light signal that lets us know whether specific contaminants are present in water, and at what levels.
Design
In the design phase of our project, the input from stakeholders was instrumental. In an iterative process of design and feedback, we came to a final design incorporating 5 requirements that our biosensor would have to fulfill in order to be successful.
Biosensor Design: Establishing requirements in concert with experts and stakeholders
Feedback sessions with stakeholders were instrumental in the design of our biosensor. At the start, we knew that chemical contamination of surface water is a severe threat to this valuable resource. The sources of contamination can be unexpected, like the dumping of chemical waste from illegal drug production. However, early sessions with stakeholders taught us that the most commonly encountered contamination is from common pharmaceuticals, like antidepressants. We therefore focused our efforts in this direction. In an iterative process of design and feedback, we identified the following 5 points as key requirements for our biosensor:
accurate detection at different concentrations;
clear and easily measurable detection signal;
possibility for detecting diverse ligands;
rapid signaling;
low-cost system.
Chemotaxis: the optimal system to meet all biosensor requirements
We chose to base our biosensor on the bacterial chemotaxis system because it offers many opportunities to address the above considerations. Because it is a native bacterial system, it can be produced at low cost (requirement V) and responds rapidly to environmental input (requirement IV).
Figure 1: The Chemotaxis Pathway of E. coli. A) The inactive pathway. B) The active pathway.
In their natural environment, the chemotaxis system is used by Escherichia coli bacteria to direct them towards the highest concentration of a ligand, or away from a harmful substance. This system uses a receptor that can be modified to detect a wealth of compounds (requirement III), (Shuangyu Bi et al. 2016). Furthermore, the sensitivity of this receptor can be fine-tuned through methylation. Customizing the methylation states facilitates the ability to"

BW25113 pEBS-csgD
The protein CsgD is a regulator of genes involved in curli assembly, induced in mid-exponential phase that are active in stationary phase. It positively controls σSexpression; its deletion should in principle interfere with biofilm formation. [1]
BW25113 pEBS-fimB
The gene fimB mediates off to on switching of fim operon, while fimE mediates on to off switching of the fim operon. Its deletion should in principle repress the fim operon, while its overexpression should in principle encourage fimbriae formation. [2]
BW25113 pEBS-mlrA
MlrA stands for a merR-like regulator A, which regulates curli production. Its overexpression should in principle suppress curli formation, while its deletion should in principle encourage curli formation. [3] BW25113 pEBS-ompA
The protein OmpA influences cellulose production by  repressing cellulose production with CpxRA stress response system; it is  overexpressed in biofilm formation and repressed when cells are exposed to  visible light. [4] BW25113 pEBS-ydeH
YdeH is a diguanylate cyclase, where its product  regulates biofilm formation and motility. Its deletion has been shown to reduce  surface attachment of the cell, its overexpression has been shown to reduce  motility as well as flagella. [5]

Valencia_UPV,2016,Team:Valencia UPV#Protocols_-_-_TEXT.html," users can get leaf                         disks from N.benthamiana using a hole punch. It is                         recommended to take the maximum agroinfiltrated area                         avoiding plant nerves. Leaf discs are put in a specific                         plate depending on the light condition requirements.                         Different samples are taken during the next two days                         after discs were made and immediately they are put in                         liquid nitrogen and stored at -80°C.
The steps to follow are:
The Passive lysis buffer 1x is prepared. Each                             disk of leaf needs 200ul. The passive lysis buffer                             is stored at 5X so it must be diluted with                             distilled water. Place it on the ice besides the                             LUCII substrate and the STOP solution.
Cut off two little leaf disks of approximately                             0.8cm and put it into an Eppendorf tube.                             Immediately, freeze it with liquid nitrogen to                             avoid the deterioration of vegetal material.
Grind the freeze sample using the metabolomics                             robot. Put the samples on ice.
Add 150ul of passive lysis buffer 1x to each                             Eppendorf tube.
Vortex gently.
Centrifuge 13200rpm during 15 minutes at 4°C.                             While switch on the luminometer.
Dilute 2:3 the extracts on a new Eppendorf                             tube. Add 36ul of Passive lysis buffer 1x and 24ul                             of sample.
Take an optimal plate to use in the                             luminometer. Fill luminometer wells with 40 ul of                             LUCII which is stored at -20°C.
10 ul of sample is added in each well. Wait                             10minutes. During this time turn on and configure                             the luminometer.
Measure luciferase activity
Prepare 40 ul/well of Dual Glo 1x (STOP                             solution + substrate). The substrate is at 50x                             concentration and stored at -20°C.
When the first luciferase measure is done, it                             is necessary to add 40 ul of Dual Glo into each                             well. Let it rest during 10 minutes.
Measure the Renilla activity.
Take the obtained information and analyze                             it.
It must be kept in mind that the luminometer                         (machine to measure the luminescence) has to be ready                         before adding the reagents to the samples because it                         needs 10min to be ready. Set the timer (10min) with the                         first sample of luciferase and add the reactant to the                         other samples as quick as possible.

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#ImprovePart_-_-_TEXT.html,"100uM CuCl2 was added to the medium. After centrifuging at 13,000 rpm for 10 minutes, the supernatant was mixed with 8-Hydroxyquinoline and K2CO3 for hydroxylamine detection and tested its UV absorbance at 700nm (see notebook for detailed protocol). Compared to sample NH2OH (Figure 5), no absorption was detected in culture supernatant (figure 6). Apart from the possibility that no NH2OH was produced, it was also possible that the produced NH2OH was exploited by E. coli. Since NH4Cl is natural nitrogen source for E. coli, decrease of NH4+ concentration does not necessarily indicate AmoA activity nor NH2OH production. Therefore, we decided to use a coupling assay to test the activity of AmoA which depends on the activity of the alpha subunit of HZS (HZSα).
From hydroxylamine to hydrazine
A senior in the laboratory helped us expressing the alpha subunit of HZS, but no expression was detected.
Solid Group-Design
We came up with a second solution of converting ammonia nitrogen into insoluble precipitation– uric acid, which ends up in sediment. This is our “solid group”. Uric acid is produced in human’s purine catabolism process with xanthine as its precursor. This reaction is catalyzed by Xanthine Oxidoreductase (XOR) in human and this enzyme also catalyzes the oxidation of hypoxanthine into xanthine. E. coli, however, lacks the ability to transfer purines into uric acid because of lack of this enzyme. Therefore, we hypothesized that introducing XOR into E. coli may enable it to produce uric acid (Figure D2). Furthermore, to elevate the efficiency at which purines are transformed into uric acid, we over expressed key enzymes in de novo purine biosynthesis pathway of E. coli to “pull” the reaction towards uric acid production. In this way, excessive nitrogen, especially ammonia nitrogen, is transferred into nitrogen in sediments and fish don’t have to bear the high concentration of ammonia.
Solid Group-Results
Key achievements
Successful expression of functional recombinant human xanthine oxidoreductase (rhXOR) in E. coli and optimization of expression conditions.
Successful production of uric acid in E. coli with extra xanthine supply.
Increase of uric acid production by over-expressing key enzymes in de novo purine biosynthesis pathway.

Our first step was to contact social entrepreneurship projects at UFSCar who could help us develop our activity. So, we found Enactus UFSCar , a group of students that carry-out educational activities with children in many       neighborhoods of São Carlos, including São Carlos 8. Then, we choose this neighborhood, that represents the living conditions of the majority of the population as the target to our intervention. This community faces the problems that can increase dengue cases (such as the       accumulation of waste, for example). Also, this neighborhood has a social organization that assists education of 6-13 years children in the neighborhood, which was very receptive to our proposal. Thus, we decided to conduct our activities at the       community center PROVIM Dom Luciano de Almeida.
Figure 3: We and Enactus UFSCar.
As our audience would be children, we have developed a playful way that allowed both approaching dengue issues and approximate children to University reality and research developed there. Thus, our team organized the play ""The mighty bacteria       against dengue"", which addressed the main aspects of the disease, ways of common and alternative prevention, in addition to the role of science in meeting demands of society. The piece was made up of five characters, interacting with each other       and with the children. Among the characters, we highlight our “repellent bacteria” (bug-shoo) and the “tire-eater bacteria” (Rubber Bye), representing Brasil-USP Team . Therefore, this activity was a moment of interaction between the two teams, which       used the themes of their projects in favor of awareness about dengue.
At the end of the presentation, the audience was divided into 10 groups to carry out the planting of Crotalaria juncea seeds, a plant that supplements dengue prevention. Crotalaria is a plant from Fabaceae family which attracts dragonflies, natural       predators of A. aegypti eggs and larvae. Thus, we conducted the planting in PET bottles, helping to reduce the garbage dumps and mosquitoes breeding sites.
Figure 4:PET bottles where the children planted Crotalaria.
During the intervention, we observed that the audience was, somewhat, awared about dengue prevention actions. After our activity, we talked to children and realized our activity impacted them reinforcing the perceptions they already had. We also contributed to introduce alternative measures for the prevention of dengue that science can offer in the future. We felt that our activity aroused children's"

PCR products were loaded and run on 1% agarose gel to check for the correct sizes of these three genes (glnA: 1640 bp, gltB: 4462 bp, gltD: 1420 bp). Among the three, we were successful in obtaining two genes — glnA and gltD. We repeated PCR for gltB for the second time by adding DMSO. This time too we could not see bands of correct size. We again carried out PCR using different annealing temperatures and the product obtained with 62°C as annealing temperature gave good bands. This was further gel purified and used as a template to carry out another PCR for the same gene. We could not see bands of correct size again.
Week 5: What next?
We anyway proceeded with cloning glnA in pSD113 (Ref. 1) and gltD in pUC19 cloning vector.
Step 1: RE digestion of glnA(insert) and pSD113(vector) with NdeI and HindIII              RE digestion of gltD(insert) and pUC19(vector) with SmaI and KpnI
Step 2: Digested vectors were gel purified and digested inserts were PCR purified. Further, glnA was ligated with pSD113 and gltD with pUC19 in 1:3 molar ratio.Each ligation mix was separately transformed in E. coli DH5α competent cells and plated separately on Luria Bertini (LB) medium + ampicillin agar plates. Few colonies from each plate were patched to create a masterplate and inoculated for plasmid preps and glycerol stocks.
Step 3:We carried out blue-white screening for gltD+pUC19, whereas we screened for glnA by carrying out a restriction digestion.
Week 6: We don't give up!
We repeated PCR for gltB using a different polymerase enzyme — Long PCR Enzyme Mix (Thermo Scientific #K0182).
We checked for the correct band (4462 bp) using agarose gel electrophoresis . Hurray! Positive results finally. gltB was further gel purified and RE digested with SalI and SmaI. pUC19 was digested with BamHI. Digested pUC19 was gel purified and digested gltB was PCR purified and a ligation reaction of both was was set up in 1:3 molar ratio. We sent out all three genes for sequencing.

Nous avons entamé une collaboration avec l'équipe de TU-Delft dans l'objectif de comparer l'efficacité de l'adhérence suivant deux approches. L'objectif est de savoir si la surproduction de curli est la meilleure stratégie pour optimiser l'adhésion d'E. coli.
D'autres collaborations avec les équipes d'Osaka ou de NYC seraient à envisager pour optimiser l'aspect de la bioremédiation du cobalt radioactif de nos souches ""Cobalt Buster"".
Il est possible d'envisager une utilisation de notre biofiltre au delà du contexte nucléaire. Le système impliquerait l'association de plusieurs souches utilisées en bioremédiation, chacune d'elle état optimisée pour la capture d'un métal ou d'autres espèces polluantes comme les hydrocarbures ou les antibiotiques ...   Ces souches seraient associées au sein d'un biofilm complexe afin de créer un biofiltre aux applications très larges, comme cela est montré sur la vidéo suivante!

Through the activities we were able to convey the message about the disease and extra scientific knowledge about the global Igem competition, and in particular synthetic biology. As part of the publicity we signed up 3000 people!! A petition calling for a change in public policy towards people with celiac disease and achieving social justice for them.
Striving for student equality rights for celiac sufferers in the school food nutrition 
Data: In most educational institutions (kindergartens and schools) in Israel, lunch is provided to students. The lunch meal is devised of a meat menu and vegetarian menu, but there is no reference to students who are sensitive to food. High school cafeterias and also academic institutions have no reference to people with celiac disease. 
Vegetarianism is a choice however intolerances to foods such as celiac is a disease which can cost human life. Student celiac patients cannot participate in the project because it does not show any sensitivity to gluten and there is no provision of gluten-free food. There is no reference by the Ministry of Education to provide a menu for food-sensitive children. In Canada and the United States there is a severe reference to peanuts sensitivity out of concern for human life, but no reference to celiac patients who are also limited nutritionally (according to publications of Celiac Associations). 
Student celiac patient actually considered unusual, especially his sense growing through the Ministry of Education advocate and educator for equal rights of the child in all enlightened countries and amended. This student must prepare food differently when everyone else eats the catering provided. He cannot buy gluten-free food in the cafeteria. It is possible to avoid embarrassing moments for the students by offering suitable alternatives at least for younger ages. 
Raising awareness of the disease in the restaurant industry 
Data: As of today there is no law binding restaurants to offer gluten-free items, awareness has increased in this issue, however not enough. Few restaurants offer a gluten-free menu, which prevents patients with celiac disease enjoy sitting in a restaurant and sometimes prevents them from this experience.
We want to change the status quo by increasing public awareness and create public pressure on this issue. Like the vegetarian and vegan age who are not statutory, but are slowly penetrating the consciousness of the Israeli restaurateurs.
To do this, we met all high school students in the city to talk about the gluten disease; there has been serious marketing on the Team's Facebook account and Facebook page. Also mall marketing activities helped raise awareness of the hundreds of people from all over the State of"

OUR PROJECT
This year the Purdue iGEM Team is tackling the problem of global     malnutrition with our new project: Minecrobe! More than 870     million people are malnourished according to the United Nations     World Food Program, and the World Health Organization states     that iro deficiency is one of the most common and widespread     nutritional disorders in the world. We plan to utilize synthetic     biology to combat this problem by engineering Bacillus subtillus     to increase plants’ ability to uptake iron from the soil, through     production of plant phytosiderophores.
As the summer comes to a close, we’ve finished our main plant     control experiment, we’re working on optimizing our transformation     protocol for bacillus, and we’re waiting for our synthesized DNA to     come in. The goal of the plant control experiment was to find out     how corn and rice grow at different levels of iron available in the     soil. We had 48 corn and 48 rice plants grow in a range from 0%     to 150% recommended iron content, and grew them for 4 weeks.     We took pH readings, height measurements, and chlorophyll     measurements at regular intervals to gauge how the plants reacted     to the varying levels of iron. At the end of the experiment we took     leaf samples from each plant, and are planning on using ICP-MS     to quantitatively find out how much iron the plants had absorbed.     We’ll be able to use this data when we compare the plants grown     with our modified bacillus in the future.
Plan for future steps: In the coming weeks, are going to finalize our bacillus     transformation protocol and then transform our constructs     into the three strains we have in our lab. We then plan to do a     siderophore assay to confirm that our constructs are working as     expected, and then choose our final strain based on the quantity     of phytosiderophores being produced. Once we have chosen our     strain, we are going to start the final plant experiment to see how     our modified Bacillus affects plant growth.

Model-based analysis of the genetic Flip-Flop
The genetic Flip-Flop
Figure 1. Scheme of the genetic Flip-Flop
The molecular circuit in Figure 1 can switch between two different stable states (LacI-ON and TetR-ON), driven by two external stimuli (UVc and IPTG). LacI-ON represents the stable state in which LacI gene is active and LacI protein represses  the TetR gene expression, with a positive feedback. Therefore, the LacI-ON state coincides with the TetR-OFF condition. On the contrary, the TetR-ON represents the state with the TetR gene active and the LacI gene silenced (LacI-OFF). Owing to the coexistence of two stable states (bistability), this circuit is capable of serving as a binary memory [Collins et al. 2000]. We denominated it  a Flip-Flop since it works as a SR Latch : LacI state is the
output and TetR state is the
output. Uvc is the set signal and IPTG is the reset signal. Indeed, IPTG stimulation inhibits LacI repressor, thus can cause the transition from the LacI-ON state to the TetR-ON. UVc radiation, inactivating LexA repressor through the SOS response [Friedberg et al. 1995] can cause the opposite transition from LacI-ON to TetR-ON.
The core elements of the genetic program are two mutually regulated promoters. The promoter transcriptional strength and the repressor binding affinity to the promoter determinate such relevant circuit properties as the bistability and the response to inputs. To quote the promoters in terms of strength and sensitivity to repressor we resorted to the following model-based analysis and numerical simulations .

BGU_Israel,2018,Team:BGU Israel#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," lower cytokine secretion. Alternately, the band may be stronger than samples 2 and 3 and the astrocytes grow in only their native medium and therefore will survive better and secrete more C3.
In sample 6 the astrocytes are grown in their native medium with out any treatment. Therefore, we expect a vary faint band which will correspond to the amount of C3 secreted by resting astrocytes.
In samples 7 and 8 the astrocytes are treated directly with TNFa, IL1a and C1q cytokines for 24 and 48 hours, respectively. We expect very bold, thick bands in these samples.
 Results:
The bands for all of the samples appear at 120kD, which is the molecular weight of the alpha subunit of the C3 protein (the long chain)1. In some of the lanes (7-15) ,there also appear faint bands at the 45kD and 13kD height. These sizes correspond to fragments of C3 which are produced after digestion by β-mercaptoethanol (which is used during western blot analysis – adding a ""Sample Buffer"") .
The bands in lanes 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,14,15 present very similar color and width.
The two biological repetitions of sample 5 (lanes 9 and 10) do not match, rather they appear to have different color and width.
Lanes 11 (sample 6), 12, and 13 (sample 7) appear bolder and thicker than the rest of the bands in the gel.
Figure 7: Effects of LPS and three cytokines (IL1a , C1q and TNFa) on activation of C8D30 astrocyte by demonstrating C3 protein levels of reactive astrocytes . Cell supernatant were immunoblotted with C3 antibody after 24 hr. and 48 hr. of activation.
Discussion:
The purpose of this experiment was to examine the level of reactivity in C8D30 astrocyte cell line. Some of the results obtained did not comply with our expectations. We expected bands 2 and 11, which correspond to the negative controls (samples 1 and 6), to appear significantly less bold than the other bands. Instead, the negative control results appear like the experimental samples. Furthermore, band 11 (astrocytes which did not receive any treatment) appears very similar to bands 12 and 13 (astrocytes activated by cytokines).

EPFL,2017,Team:EPFL#Description#Aptamers_-_-_TEXT.html," closing of the flow channels by pressurizing the control channels using an incompressible fluid such as water. Under the control layer, the so-called flow layer encapsulates the reagents. Both layers are finally aligned and fixed on an epoxy-coated glass slide as shown in Figure 1 (A). In Figure 1 (B), a magnified view shows two unit cells and the fluid within these cells can be controlled by three separate mechanical valves: the sandwiches, the neck and the button.
Figure 1: Disassembled view of a MITOMI 768 chip (A) and magnified view showing two unit cells (B).
Once the chip is ready to be used, reagents are held within small pieces of Tygon tubing that are plugged into the inlets of the flow layer with connecting metal pins. Tubes filled with deionised water are plugged into the control layer in order to open or close mechanical systems. The tubings that are plugged into the flow inlets are used to flow all the chemicals (NeutrAvidin, protein, aptamers, …).
Before running an experiment, the glass surface of the channel is patterned with NeutrAvidin at the button area, while all other parts of the channel are passivated with biotinylated BSA as shown in Figure 2, enabling the specific binding of biotinylated proteins or DNA oligos to the button area.
Figure 2: Surface chemistry and sandwich assay on MITOMI
Since the first reactant will need to bind to NeutrAvidin, the first compound, which is being flown in the various channels, must be biotinylated. At least one compound of the experiment must integrate a fluorophore since the chip is being analyzed under a fluorescent microscope.
To summarize, the general workflow starting from mold fabrication to data analysis of a MITOMI experiment is shown in Figure 3.
