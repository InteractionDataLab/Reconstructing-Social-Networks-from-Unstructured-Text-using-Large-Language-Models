WHU-China,2013,Team:WHU-China#templates#hp_-_-_TEXT.html," each other, We are all looking forward to further cooperation between WHU-iGEMers and Shenzhen BGI-iGEMers in the near future. 3.Giving CAU team suggestions
We communicated with team CAU(China Agriculture University).Both teams introduced projects  and give some meaningful advice to each other. Since it is the first time for CAU to attend the IGEM, we offered some basic guidence to them.
Lectures to peers
1.In the College of Chemistry and Molecular Science of WHU
In order to raise the profile of the IGEM, especially within the freshmen who just start their colorful life in the campus, and promote the academic communication between different subjects in IGEM, we publicized the IGEM competition and our 2012-IGEM project to the freshmen in College of Chemistry and Molecular Science of Wuhan University. Furthermore, we had a heated discussion on the future of the synthetic biology through the different perspectives of biology and chemistry, which made us know more about how to combine the study methods of biology and chemistry on synthetic biology studying. We mainly discussed the following topics: (1). Introduced the IGEM, including the organizers, the ideas and significance of this competition, and the form of this competition. (2). Took our IGEM project of converting the excessive intake glucose into cellulose and degrading overmuch fatty acids by Escherichia coli, as an example to explain how an IGEM project works. (3). Communicated the meaning, study methods, and the future of the synthetic biology through the different views of biology and chemistry. We found that biologists concentrated more on the whole biological function of the designed protein, whereas the chemist focused more on the structure and chemical properties of the designed protein. However, since the structure and chemical properties of the protein are essential factors of function studying, once we can perfectly combine the study methods and ideas of biology and chemistry, the synthetic biology studying will grow with leaps and bounds. 2.In the College of Life Sciences of WHU
In order to raise the profile of the IGEM, especially to the sophomores who are full of enthusiasm to study synthetic biology, we publicized the IGEM competition and our 2013-IGEM project to the sophomores in College of Life Science of Wuhan University. Furthermore, we had a heated discussion on the application of our precise gene expression regulation system and the research significance of the synthetic biology.

BASIC PARTS
Keratinases are a type of proteolytic enzymes, meaning they are capable of breaking down proteins into smaller units (1). While keratinases have been isolated within several different fungal and bacterial species, they have not been commonly expressed in E. coli K12 which is a gram-negative bacteria.
For the project we are using a strain of E. coli called JM109 as our bacterial chassis which allows us to express protein at a relatively high rate and to work more easily in the lab.
Keratinases were previously used by the Chicago and Sheffield iGEM teams. Chicago attempted to express keratinase in Bacillus subtilis but was unsuccessful in transforming the genes.  The University of Sheffield experienced a cleaving issue as they did not remove the signal peptide from the Bacillus (gram-positive) gene sequence. This causes an issue because of the differing amount of membranes between gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, and the differences in how the bacteria must secrete the enzymes. Therefore, in optimizing the keratinase genes for expression in E.coli, we removed the gram-positive signal sequence entirely and replaced it with pelB (a signal peptide, and biobrick part, optimized for secretion of protein in E.coli).
Figure 1: Shows a generalized depiction of the membrane differences between Bacillus and E.coli.  The light blue tag at the end of the protein represents the native signal peptide, while the orange tag is representative of the optimization.  During the optimization, the original signal peptide was completely removed and replaced with pelB.
Once these basic part are paired with a promoter, keratinase should be expressed and secreted into the periplasm. Because of the toxicity of accumulating high amounts of keratinase, the bacteria would the release keratinase from the periplasm into the cell-growth media.
These parts were synthesized and placed in the pSB1C3 backbone using the standard biobrick assembly. Before the synthesis, the correct start and stop codons were added, and we checked to ensure that the protein coding sequences were not altered during the other optimization steps by comparing the DNA sequences using Clustal. NEBCutter V2.0 was also used to check for any illegal restriction sites. Keratinase A (Ker"

This time will be my last time to enter this competition as a high school student, but I think I will continue doing the iGEM competition. I’m looking forward to next year’s opportunity.
Ji, Huanding
Teammate
Hello, I’m Huanding Ji from SHSBNU. Currently in grade 12, I had mainly taken responsibility in experiments in the summer vacation and weekends. I have very deep interest in biology and have nearly decided it as my major in college, which is the main reason why I decided to join iGEM_SHSBNU. Prior to this competition, I had taken part in Accelerated Biology Course, Advanced Biology Course, Gene Engineering Course, and trainings for various kinds of biological competitions. I tried to make use of all the resources available in our high school in the field of biology.

I am a team member in SHSBNU_China and my contribution for this team is HP part—making an interview and contact other teams for cooperation. At school, two other team members and I established Synthesis Biology club in order to let more students know there is a subject can even “create life”.About myself, this experience of taking part in IGEM really influence me a lot, it just like opening the door of the new world and also help me determine the direction of future study.
Li, Boxuan
Teammate
Hello, I’m Boxuan Li, one of SHSBNU team. It is so lucky for me to meet my team members and I think the experience is extremely impressive. At first, because there are four students in our team, we need to learn more about biology, and then we also learnt about lab operation. During this summer holiday, I nearly spend all of my time on experiments. Certainly, I learned a lot in biological engineering and get good results on experiments. My works are experiments and searching some sources on non-invasive detection of bacteria and materials of capsules which suit our project. In conclusion, I hope our team can get some successful achievements.

Successful Results
Both Long GolS P118A (BBa_K2048002) and Long GolS (BBa_K2048001) constructs responded to gold concentrations in a dose-responsive manner up to 1uM
Long GolS P118A (BBa_K2048002) is specific to gold
Long GolS (BBa_K2048001) is more responsive to both gold and copper concentrations than York 2013 construct (BBa_K1127008)
Long GolS (BBa_K2048001) was found to be significantly more response to gold than it is to copper
Unsuccessful Results
Cell-free assay required further modifications
Future plans and direction
Make Long GolS P118A (BBa_K2048002) and Long GolS (BBa_K2048001) work in a cell-free environment
Integrate that cell-free environment onto a paper-based system (first fresh paper-based system and then freeze-dried paper-based system)
Discussion
The iGEM Toronto 2016 team was successful at modifying an naturally existing transcription factor called GolS (natively found in Salmonella enterica) to contain certain mutations that have been found to cause CueR (a copper-response factor in Escherichia coli) to increase sensitivity to gold and significantly decrease it's sensitivity to copper. This modification was due to an amino acid change from proline to alanine at site 118. This successful synthetic change can be found composite BioBricks, Long GolS P118A (BBa_K2048002) compared to the unchanged Long GolS (BBa_K2048001) . For further details on what is contained in the Long GolS P118A BioBrick, see Figure 1.

Biobrick: Red Fluorescent Protein measurement (FAILED)
Goal:
Measure the expression of the Bba_J04450 biobrick in transformed dH5α cells. This is done by measuring fluorescence.
Procedure:
1. Incubated dH5α, J04450 transformed cells were dilluted 1:100 with LB
2. 200 µL, 5 replicates of LB, LB with Chloramphenicol and 5 dH5α dillutions made from different batches were applied to a 96 well plate
3. Tecan plate reader was used to measure absorbance at 588 nm and fluorescence at excitation 584 nm and emission 607 nm with the following parameters:
Temperature: 37,0°C, varying from 36,5°C to 37,5°C
Kinetic cycles: 750
Gain: 40
Z position: 18055 µM
Shaking: 300 s
Orbital shaking amplitude: 3 mm
Results:
The wells dried out, presumably due to us choosing not to use a lid on the plate, and the measurements were therefore aborted by the machine.

Virginia,2012,Team:Virginia#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," The denaturing solution contained 6M, 50mM Tris (pH 8.9), and variable DTT. The control solution did not increase urea concentration. Lysate/denaturing mixtures were incubated (1 hour, 37°C). As a negative control, some mixture was applied dropwise to a pregnancy test kit, as per instructions on the kit.
After incubation, each mixture was titrated with folding solution in order to render hCG-β detectable by a pregnancy test kit. Folding solution was prepared so that upon its addition, final concentrations of reagents were 4.8mM Cysteamine, 4.4mM Cystamine, 1M Urea, and 1mM EDTA. Titration with folding solution (0.5ml/minute for 14 minutes) brought the final volume to 8mL.The final mixture was incubated at room temperature for 16 minutes and applied dropwise to pregnancy tests. Test kits remained at room temperature overnight and were read the following day.
Results
Phage Production
Following transformation, and after four hours of incubation during which cell density increased, the O.D. of the E. coli transformants steeply declined. Clearing was also observed upon addition of the transformants to a fresh culture of E. coli. However, no clearing was observed when T7 genomic DNA was mixed with non-competent cells, demonstrating that the previous results were indeed due to transformation, and the genome was not contaminated with intact phage particles. These results support that T7 phage genome was taken up by host cells, transcribed and translated, and packaged into intact, infective phage. Production of BPP phage was not observed in transformations with bronchiseptica, so the Gibson assembly product was not used to produce modified BPP phage.

This is the assumption we made for approach 1 for modeling the reaction. We can see that under the conditions we assumed, the reaction behaves like a Michaelis-Menten reversible reaction.
Inhibition of directions:
Examination of the in vitro properties of the recombinant AKR1C2 showed that it was potently inhibited in the oxidation direction by NADPH [6] . Since all AKRs catalyze an ordered bi-bi reaction, we can assume the enzyme we chose to use - AKR1C9 - has the same mechanism."

Introduction.
Overview.
Our project aims to construct a synthetic biological device based on a digital circuit called a multiplexer. Our system is designed to generate a response dependent solely on the provided input signals. As multiple input signals were needed, we had to test multiple inducible promoters. Activities  of these promoters are induced by presence or absence of various monosaccharides: xylose, arabinose, rhamnose and disaccharide melibiose. Thus, their concentrations were equivalent to analog signals that could be converted to expression of serine recombinases (phage integrases) in an 'all-or-none' way, providing us with a digital control over the system.
Using the interases' ability to recognize nonidentical sites and invert or excise identified sequence, one may make DNA editable in vivo. One of the possible uses of such a sub-system is to create a biological equivalent of a transistor - dubbed a transcriptor -  that uses DNA polimerase flow as an analogue of the electric current, while exploiting the integrase as a control signal. That suffices to build an SR-latch - the simplest memory cell, being one of the basic units of the Von Neumann computer architecture.  The resultant DNA-based memory storage can be propagated when cells divide.
We envision that the abilities of integrases could allow switching expression  on and off, targeting various genetic components.
Inspiration.
We were inspired by a digital circuit - a multiplexer - allowing to choose an arbitrary input signal x and send it to the output y using adressing signal a. Strobe signal S forces the original device to ignore the inputs producing 0 as an output. Our modifications of the circuit include a multiple rewritable memory cell functionality - the device is designed to comprise of three SR-latches (each memorizing one bit of information). The strobe signal resets them to 0 state. The output has 8 cumulative states while still remaining digital - one may choose more than one input to be included independently.
Implementation.
Input signals are concentrations of saccharides rhamnose, xylose and melibiose, and the strobe signal is the concentration of arabinose. Each of them induces expression of a corresponding integrase. We have decided to use standard reporting genes - fluorescent proteins - as an output,"

Overall Project
Aromatic organosulfur compounds in heavy oils or bitumen resources, such as the Alberta oil sands, are toxic and difficult to remove during the refining process. While industrial scale methods for the removal of inorganic sulfur compounds have been developed, existing methods of hydrodesulfurization do not efficiently remove organosulfur compounds. Recent advances in biocatalytic desulfurization promise to improve the refining process by reducing energy requirements, carbon emissions and waste streams. However, existing methods of biocatalytic desulfurization using single engineered isolates in bioreactors have yet to become industrially scalable.
Here, we propose that communities of microorganisms expressing a distributed pathway for desulfurization will perform better than single strains in culture when treating complex mixtures of organosulfur compounds present in heavy oils or bitumen. To this end, we will engineer consortia capable of desulfurization using synthetic biology and environmental genomic approaches. We have chosen to distribute the 4S desulfurization pathway, due to its retention of the carbon skeleton and consequent preservation of the fuel’s energy density, among the members of the microbial community.

TMMU_China,2016,Team:TMMU China#Project&Results#Project3_-_-_TEXT.html," solution is a signal peptide from the Usp45 protein which is secreted out of L. lactis very efficiently. Fusion of the signal peptide of Usp45 to a couple of proteins resulted in an efficient way of secreting the coded proteins into the media. The fusion protein will meet a chaperone protein, SecB, which bring the fusion protein to a protein secretion apparatus. This apparatus cleaves the signal peptide and frees the proteins from the cell.
Figure3.1:The surface display system
Design
The protein of interest is fused to the cA domain with the USP45 signal peptide, driven by the PnisZ promoter and followed by the nisin resistant gene nsr. To demonstrate the utility of the protein surface display, here we took the β-galactosidase protein as a proof of concept.
Figure3.2:Design of the surface display system
Result
To demonstrate whether cA could indeed anchor the protein of interest at the surface of L. lactis, the pLacZ-Cytosol and pLacZ-Surface plasmids were introduced into NZ9000 respectively. As stated above, the cA domain is derived from the AcmA protein, which is an autolysin of L. latis that cleaves the peptidoglycan to release the duplicated bacteria. Since the substrate peptidoglycan is now occupied by the cA-β-galactosidase fusion proteins, the AcmA autolysin activity is hindered, thus cell separation will be interfered. Indeed, we found that under microscopic, the NZ-Surface cells were poorly separated compared to the NZ-Cytosol strain. Further more, using a polyclonal antibody against β-galactosidase, we found that about 70% of the β-galactosidase protein is present at the cell wall, while the other 30% protein is present in the cytoplasm, perhaps due to the inefficient secretion process. In contrast, all theβ-galactosidase proteins were present in the cytoplasm in the NZ-cytosol strain.
Figure3.3:The protein surface display system for L. lactis. A). Microscopic picture of the NZ-Cytosol and NZ-surface. The LysM domains of cA can compete with the autolysins of L. lactis, thus the NZ-surface strain is poorly separated after nisin induction. B).

Human Practices : Extensive probing performed to understand how our science and society synergistically shape one another, with special focus on investigating issues within the human practices frontier and how this will impact design and execution of the project
Proof of Concept : Our project demonstrates that the GAF protein could be a viable natural alternative to artificial food dyes. In real-world applications our project would need to evaluated under color properties, protein properties, production capabilities, safety, environmental effects, and societal effects. Within our project we address at least one aspect of these major concerns to represent a broad proof-of-concept that GAF proteins could be brought into industry and further the human food system

The London meet up was a great experience and gave us presenting experience. We received great feedback from the other teams about our project and constructive feedback on presenting.
   
Open Days
In an effort to promote our message to prospective students of our university; our iGEM team had a stall at a number of open days across Summer and Autumn. Here, prospective students got the chance to learn how to use some of our equipment (we were not aware that autopipettes were such a crowd pleaser!). We had a wonderful time getting to know students eager to hear about the iGEM competition and our project, some even brainstormed ideas they might put forward as part of a 2017 team! It was very encouraging to learn that many students felt that an opportunity to take part in the competition might fill the void left by their pre-university education. This is because some believed that their enthusiasm for innovation in science was stifled by a rigid national curriculum.
Moreover, not only did we receive a lot of interest from students but also from parents, whom we helped learn a bit more about the scope of genetic engineering and what impact it might have on their lives. This was particularly pertinent for our project as our focal disease is osteoporosis. A few spoke about family members afflicted with the condition and were very excited to take our leaflets home to find out more about our iGEM team project through our various social media accounts.
Public Engagement
Another key aspect for iGEM is public engagement. This year we decided to integrate social media with our project in order to educate and understand the public’s views on synthetic biology. We made regular updates on our project using or facebook, instagram and twitter pages. We engaged with almost 1,000 people across all social media platforms.  To get an insight on public understanding on GMO’s, members of our team went into Leicester city centre to talk with the public. We asked them the following questions:
What is a GMO?
What is DNA?
How do you feel about using Genetic Engineering?
What about Synthetic Biology?
What is your opinion on our project?
Does our project idea affect your opinion?
If you could save a life/treating a disease through genetic engineering, would you?
We got mixed results, most people had positive opinions about GMO’s while other had no idea what GMO’s were. People were supportive of our project and felt better after we explained to them how genetic engineering works and helps the public. We’re hoping that after talking to the public, public opinion will have improved in"

Grenoble-EMSE-LSU,2013,Team:Grenoble-EMSE-LSU#Documentation#Notebook#May_-_-_TEXT.html," Tristar microplate reader. Production is induced with arabinose, a kind of sugar.
Qualitatively, fluorescence starts appearing three hours after induction with arabinose. Originally we didn't think it would take this long. A microscope picture was taken, where we can clearly see GFP fluorescence. Our advisors say that we didn't have enough controls to make sure this was actually GFP expression, though. THis is true as we didn't compare our results to wild-type cells, and it means we will have to be more rigorous from now on. Examples would be wild-type cell autofluorescence, LB autofluorescence, and an estimation of the measurement errors incurred by our use of devices such as the microplate reader.
Thursday
As we know the state of the cells is often determined by the amount of cells in a culture when a fresh culture is started, we want to obtain OD600 measurements at the same time as fluorescence measurements on the microplate reader. Unfortunately we can't do this with our microplate reader, since the photomultiplier has a certain position for fluorescence readings and another for absorbance readings. (the user has to manually change the position of the detector every time one wants to change the mode). We could also have problems if we used clear plastic microplates to do fluorescence measurements as well as absorbance measurements since there can be fluorescence crosstalk between adjacent wells.
We thus have to use fluorescence only. A characterization curve has to be made in order to link actual OD600 measurements to their equivalents in fluorescence. The instrument would measure the amount of light scattered by the samples, which is a function of OD, by using the same emission and excitation filters.
The trend seems to be decreasing fluorescence with increasing OD600, contrary to our expectations, as intuition would have it that scattered light increases with the amount of cells. The trend seems linear but this isn't sure because of measurement noise: we would need additional points to make sure. Another experiment has to be done.
Friday
Meeting with Yohan Roulland at the Institut Albert Bonniot (Grenoble medical campus), regarding the use of KillerRed. Information obtained: KillerRed is more effective as a dimer, whereas the gene itself only codes for a monomer. The dimer form can be obtained by fusing one KillerRed protein to another directly after it on the gene, or by fusing it with two different proteins which operate close to each other in the cell, thereby bringing their respective KillerRed proteins close enough for dimerization to occur. Expression of KillerRed in the cytoplasm of different organelles in"

We had a lot of fun with these three teams. The meet up is set in Hangzhou where two of the teams are located, and we spent our time together from July 26 to July 30. We arrived in Hangzhou at 2:00pm on July 26 and then went to a meeting with the representatives of the other three teams to plan the presentation and activities on July28 and July 30. The representatives came up with the idea of doing simple experiments in order to attract the kids. We spent some time at the meeting room thinking about the possible experiments we can do. We thought about different types of activity that can introduce our project and synthetic biology to the younger kids. However, we didn’t pass any of the plans due to feasibility problem or safety-related concerns.
On July 27, we visited the lab that ASTWS-China and Worldshaper-Nanjing are using. We went to see the facilities and were told about the functioning of the equipment there. Another meet up is held as well. We continued our discussion about the presentation and activities, and finally we decided doing science-related experiments would be fine as the condition in the museum wouldn’t allow the kids to sit down and wait. It’s also hard to decide the type of experiment regarding safety, short duration and equipment availability. On the other hand, we started our preparation on the PPT and graphs that are needed for demonstration.
On July 28, we went to Zhejing University where the lab of Worldshaper-XSHS is located. We visited their lab and the team leaders discussed about the usage of Bio Parts sent by the committee as ours seemed have already denatured due to preservation problem. Recently, there were a few technique-related problems in our experiment. The leader and members from experimental group discussed about the possible cause and showed us their colony of fungi， given that we had trouble"

Our inoculum in LB liquid medium chloramphenicol 34 µg/µl with the transforming from BB_Essential + K346004 and BB_Essential + E0840 didn’t grow. ='(
We isolated from the plate with the binding made yesterday. Twelve new colonies of BB_Essential + K346004, 2 colonies of BB_Essential + E0840 and 2 colonies of BB_Essential + BB_Bioremediation.
Hoooowever, the BB_Essential + BB_Bioremediation developed!! \o/ We extracted plasmid DNA!
Electrophoretic profile of pBSK with BB_Essential + BB_Bioremediation:
1 – 2: pBSK with BB_Essential + BB_Bioremediation.
To confirm if the BB_Essential + BB_Bioremediation binding worked, we’re going to cut with EcoRI and Pstl to release the biobrick. It’s expected that the biobrick will have about to 3.057 base pairs. We made enzymatic digestion using the following system:
The samples were digested from two different clones of BB_Essential + BB_Bioremediation and we applied it in agarose gel 0,8%.
Electrophoretic profile of the enzymatic digestion using EcoRI and PstI from pBSK on BB_Essential + BB_Bioremediation:
1 – 3: pBSK “with” BB_Essential + BB_Bioremediation not digested.
2 – 4: pBSK “with” BB_Essential + BB_Bioremediation digested using EcoRI and PstI.
Definitely…. This wasn’t the expected results! =(
The enzymatic digestion should’ve released a fragment of around 3.057 base pairs, but it’s electrophoretic profile doesn’t shows a cut “vector-fragment”, but a linear vector instead. What will we do now? The strategy to solve"

The objective of this debate was to achieve a state of art on the ethics questions raised by synthetic biology, and our project. Thus, we were convinced that our different stakeholders could provide pertinent questions on the differents issues related to the subject. We wanted to present to the scientist community this ethics debate.
Unfortunately, a technical failure does not allow us to add english subtitles to the first part of the video! This part will be added as soon as possible on youtube. However, a report has been achieved on the stakeholders talks and can be found after the videos.

Summarization of reflections
« Ethics is the movement of the Liberty which searches a well life, in the solicitude toward others is in just use of social institutions »; Paul Ricoeur quotation, philosopher of the 20th century. In other terms, ethic represents the philosophical field gathering moral values which define the way we have to behave.
Applied to synthetic biology, ethics indicates the way to follow in order to allow this discipline development by avoiding its drifts. Indeed, even if it lets dream to large perspectives as new energy sources, accessible therapies to all or biological remediation methods, to manipulate the living rises regularly to a certain number of ethic questions. François Le Fèvre mentions « it is the first time that human is confronted to the possibility to create new forms of life ».
It seemed  important to us to interest to these points, beside the biologic engineering  technic aspect. In this way, we organized an ethic debate based on the topic of the synthetic biology, in which some different expert key figures of the domain were invited. During this debate, different problematics were raised.  Like emphasized Thierry Magnin, some of them are of metaphysical order, and concern notably what «this gives us as the living representation, as life »; some others concern direct applications and their technical aspects which can push us to imitate them. At the occasion of this debate, we presented our project to our guests in order to take out ethic questions.

Samples were then spread plated and colony forming units (CFUs) were counted. All parts were carried on the pSB1C3 plasmid and transformed into E. coli BL21 (DE3). Samples that were induced were done so with Isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) to a final concentration of 0.2 nM.
Henceforth samples will be refered to as:
KillerOrange induced
KillerOrange not induced
KillerRed induced
KillerRed not induced
RFP
Control: BL21 (DE3)
See protocol for detailed method.
KillerRed is excited by green/yellow light (540-580 nm) and KillerOrange by blue light (460-490 nm). We constructed a box around the LED array to prevent ambient light entering. Access to the inside of the box was gained through an opening cut in the front. With help from Ryan Edginton , we used a portable spectrometer (Ocean Optics USB2000+VIS-NIR-ES, connected to a CC3 cosine corrector with a 3.9 mm collection diameter attached to a 0.55 mm diameter optical fibre) to measure light spectra and absolute intensity in the visible range.

Metabolic Kill Switch: Results
Characterisation experiment
The following graphs show the average percentage viable cells for induced and uninduced samples after 6 hrs of exposure  to 1.2 mW/cm2 of white light and an average temperature of 38.63 °C. CFU count for the control condition was treated as 100 % and viable cells calculated  as a proportion of that value. CFUs were not counted above 300. Error bars represent  the standard error of the mean. Little to no difference in CFU count is shown between the control (BL21 (DE3)) and kill switch samples when they are kept in the dark. There is a significant difference in the number of CFUs when the kill switch samples are exposed to light.

May 3 ~ May 9, 2010 Write a PPT on the framework of our game, which focused on database. We came to the conclusion that the database should have the following features, quick search, links to reactions, inheritance between different parts, easy to add elements, and most of them are still suitable now(Aug, 2010).
May 10 ~ May 16, 2010 We decide to realize the database and simulation of a biological oscillator first, the model was presented in article “A synthetic oscillatory network of transcriptional regulators”, Nature 2000.
May 17 ~ Jun 6, 2010 Summarize the reactions of oscillator, learn SBML and libsbml APIs. Search biomodels.net for SBMLs on oscillator created by other people and learn from them.

May 3 ~ May 9, 2010 Study the specification document of libsbml make an attempt at developing a sbml ode solver basing on the sundials math library.
May 10 ~ May 16, 2010 After meeting difficulty of developing a sbml ode solver from scratch, We turn to the existing library.

TUDelft,2017,Team:TUDelft#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html," to dialogues with the public, risk assessors, and potential users, we changed our design from a GMO-based lab tool to a safe and reliable end product. Key points that we took from discussions with stakeholders were that the method needs to combine a simplified sample preparation, a fast, easy readout and the possibility for on-site use. We integrated all these in our project, by designing a cell-free method that can be stored for up to two weeks and produces a visible readout.
We started by finding a relevant case in which our device could make a contribution. Through a conversation with a veterinarian, we were advised to narrow our scope to mastitis, an udder infection affecting dairy cows.
Every milk farmer faces mastitis, a challenging udder disease affecting dairy cows.
Bouwe Gall Frank (veterinarian)
This infection is not easy to get rid of; udders are exposed to the open environment, making the infection a common re-occurrence. All dairy farmers we spoke to in the Netherlands have had to deal with mastitis. Farmers want to have fast administration of antibiotics when treating this disease, as time is of the essence. Our tool makes sure that fast treatment of mastitis can be done in a responsible way, without misusing antibiotics, thereby helping to prevent the evolution of antibiotic resistant bacteria. Looking to mastitis, we adapted our tool to detect relevant resistance genes in the common pathogen, Staphylococcus Aureus (SAU), causing this disease.
It is relevant to be able to detect SAU pathogens. As there is a huge difference in sensitivity for antibiotics considering MRSA, it would be added value to have a conclusive result on the sensitivity.
Maaike van den Berg (veterinarian)
After talking to experts with expertise in mastitis from the Wageningen Bioveterinary Research Center in Lelystad, we found that detecting the mecA and blaZ genes was the way to go.
MecA can be used to detect resistance against all β-lactam antibiotics.
Fimme van der Wal (agricultural researcher)
Detection of blaZ is a conclusive result to exclude commonly used penicillin treatment.
Dik Mevius (agricultural researcher)

After defining our end-users and detection goal, we looked at how we could make our device as user-friendly as possible. From the start of our project, we wanted to integrate the use of tardigrade intrinsically disordered proteins (TDPs) which are able to maintain the"

I．Cre recombinase
Cre recombinase is a 38-kDa monomeric protein encoded by bacteriophage P1. Cre binds cooperatively to loxP sites ( which remains to be elucidated later ), with one Cre monomer contacting each of two 13-bp recombinase binding elements arranged as inverted repeats around a central strand-exchange region (Fig. 1) . Cre promotes the synapsis of loxP-containing DNA substrates and catalyzes recombination between the sites, as shown in Fig. 2.
II. LoxP site
Lox P (locus of X-over P1) is the recognition site of Cre recombinase on the Bacteriophage P1 consisting of 34 bp. There exists an asymmetric 8 bp sequence in between with two sets of palindromic, 13 bp sequences flanking it. The detailed structure is given below.
The asymmetric 8bp sequence between the two palindromes is the only factor that contributes to the orientation of LoxP site. The system works in 3 ways in the presence of Cre recombinase.  Two LoxP sites with the same orientation leads to the deletion of the sequences between these two sites, while an opposite orientation leads to an inversion of the sequences between them. Two separate DNA sequences with one LoxP site respectively will integrate in the aid of Cre recombinase. The detailed mechanism will be demonstrated below.
A Schematic drawing of the Cre–loxP site-specific recombination pathway, based on the strand-swapping model (Nunes-Düby et al., 1995) and on Cre–loxP structural models (Guo et al., 1997;). Conserved tyrosine residues from two of the four recombinases in a synaptic tetramer cleave the DNA backbones of the recombining segments to form transient 3'-phosphotyrosine linkages. The released 5'-hydroxyl ends of the cleaved DNA undergo intermolecular nucleophilic attack of the partner phosphotyrosine linkages to complete the exchange of one pair of strands and form a Holliday intermediate. A second round of cleavages and strand exchanges using the remaining two recombinase subunits and the complementary DNA strands gives recombinant products.
III. Working Strategy
The working strategy of our system is elucidated as below. The figure ( B ) depicts the sequence at work. Two promoters, which promotes transcription in opposite directions"

"
UC_San_Diego,2017,Team:UC San Diego#HP#Gold Integrated_-_-_TEXT.html,". We realized that the scale of the work we were doing in the lab was not even close to the industrial scale we were envisioning, so we thought that it would be important to discuss the factors and considerations when trying to increase the production from cyanobacteria. Thus, we decided to get in contact with a local San Diego company, Triton Algae, to discuss the challenges of working with S. elongatus.
Exploration
Our discussion with research scientists at Triton Algae centered around strategies to decrease costs of producing the tagatose even further. At this point, by switching to a genetic engineering - based method rather than chemical-based, we had already significantly decreased the cost of synthesizing tagatose. The implementation of the four-step metabolic pathway was an important step, but he thought that we could also consider the environmental impact of our project. We learned that the current methods for algae cultivation include open and closed systems, including raceway ponds and photo-bioreactors (PBR) . He invited us to consider the lifecycle of the platform and choose to optimize our design accordingly.
In addition, one of the research scientists also pointed us to one of his publications and emphasized that the success of this project from an engineering perspective also required some research about materials science and how it pertains to bioreactors. He also suggested that we try to perform a
Deliberation
Now that we knew about the importance of differentiating between upstream and downstream bioprocessing, we also wanted to do our best so that our product could become even more cost-effective. Since we were now using a co-culture design, it was important to consider the upstream processing for the cyanobacteria component of our platform.
Point 11: Entrepreneurship and concept validation
Rationale
Because we wanted to ultimately make a product that could be utilized by industry, we decided to get advice about how to proceed with commercialization of our wet lab work, including concept validation and tapping into the Bay Area ecosystem of thriving startups. We decided to go to the Livermore iGATE Innovation Hub because it represents a unique combination of technology based startups, science innovation through partnerships with Sandia National Laboratories, and a growing network of life sciences investors. Specifically, we were looking for the key criteria that would be hit or miss for most investors.
Exploration

Achievements
Safety
Safety is a vital, if occasionally underappreciated, aspect of experimental work and as such we ensured that we followed the steps necessary to maintain a safe laboratory environment. Additionally following protocols correctly reduces the risk of mistakes and contamination of samples. All members of the team were briefed on general laboratory safety and on any specifics relating to our experiments before undertaking laboratory work.
General Laboratory Safety Protocols
When moving about the laboratory you must walk, not run. Additionally you should not move in such a way that you would inhibit others in their work.
Clothes must be suitable for laboratory work. This means no open toed shoes, loose/dangling jewelry or long hair that is not tied back.
Labcoats must be worn and correctly fastened at all times when in the laboratory. When not in use they should be hung on a hook or on the back of a chair not thrown on the floor or put on a bench. Gloves should be worn when handling anything involving live samples or harmful chemicals.
When an experiment requires it other safety equipment such as goggles should be worn.
When moving samples and equipment outside the laboratory at least one hand must be non-gloved for opening doors and operating lifts.
Do not chew pencils/pens or touch the area around your mouth when in the laboratory.
When lit and not in use bunsen burners should be left on the yellow safety flame not the hot blue flame.
You should not use your phone while in the laboratory to prevent contamination and risk of samples leaving laboratory.
Spills should be dealt with straight away, if unsure ask someone for help. Accidents should be reported to the first aid team so they can be dealt with properly, and any medical attention can be given.
Hands should be washed when leaving the lab to remove any bacteria that may be on them, particularly if work was undertaken without gloves.
Before undertaking laboratory work, you must have read and signed the relevant COSHH form for the experiment.
Used equipment must be put in the correct waste container. Tips must be put into one of the marked tip containers.
Food must not be eaten in the laboratory.
Follow safety instructions on equipment, ask if you are unsure how something works.
Safety Details for Project-Specific Experiments
We consulted PhD advisors during more specialised experiments or when we were using specialised equipment such as a"
Wageningen_UR,2016,Team:Wageningen UR#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html," sugar water, end up in the brood food and be transported to cells where bee larvae grow and where the mites are present. Inside the cell it will ""sense"" and kill the mite, strongly increasing the chances of survival for the colony. Existing technologies use for example thymol, a pure toxin. Thymol is not only toxic to mites, but to bees as well. It has to be applied three times a year and interferes with honey, which can make it taste like mouthwash. The ""do not change the consumer principle"" turned out to be an important input point. Rather than requiring that beekeepers have to change the sugar baskets they use (since some of them are not completely dark), we decided adapt the system in such a way that it will not be killed by the light of the sugar basket. A box-like product is the most ideal form since it can be applied to all sugar-water-basket systems.
Collaboration
DAE
We initiated contact with students from the Design Academy Eindhoven to enhance the interdisciplinarity of our project. We met up several times and discussed science, society and where those overlap. Their views on our project and synbio in general helped us in designing our project and adapting it to real life demands. For a concrete collaboration, we asked one of the students – Thieu – to design our end product, BeeT, in a way it could be presented to future users. Our collaboration with the DAE did not only lead to us having a positively received final product design, but also led to our project influencing the design students’ projects.  One of the students gave us the opportunity to have a “real life bee experience”. The aim of this project was to study group dynamics, stress, and teamwork. The task was to prepare a dish (Baklava) like bees would do it. Leif Czakai made a movie out of this.
Synenergene
Synenergene is a four year program to promote the dialogue about the future of synthetic biology between relevant stakeholders, contributing to responsible research and innovation. Synenergene partners, including the Rathenau institute, are in close collaboration with several iGEM teams from all over the world.
Our collaboration with Synenergene consisted of two assessments: an application scenario and a techno-moral vignette. The assessments were intended to help us evaluate the viability as well as the societal impact of our envisioned product. We chose to write a “Resource from the future” for our techno-moral vignette. “Resource” is the magazine and news website of students and employees"

Virginia,2012,Team:Virginia#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," cells expressing wild-type hCG in the pET-30a vector with B-PER reagent initially resulted in no positive pregnancy tests. When the pregnancy tests were checked the next morning (>12 hours after the initiation of the experiment), there was one positive band on the pregnancy test treated with 17-hour induced whole cell extract with no denaturant. We suspected that the B-PER was interfering with the ELISA and switched to lysis with T7 and sonication.
The solution was deposited next to ""S"" and flowed to the right. The test band is on the left (""T"") and the control band is on the right (""C"").
We then attempted T7 lysis and sonication using a culture expressing synCG. Applying a denaturing solution without DTT to a combination of four synCG cultures yielded a dark stain on the entire left side with a darker band in the test region, for both T7 lysis and sonication.
Controls were also conducted. Commercially ordered hCG dimer produces a bright ""T"" band on the test kit; however, the band is noticeably lighter if the protein undergoes denaturation and refolding before application to a test. We  can therefore expect a positive test result using a modified phage to yield a similarly light band. In the negative control (absence of hCG), there is no ""T"" band.
T7 modification
T7 phage genome was isolated, restricted at a unique BclI site, cleaned-up, CIAP-treated, and cleaned up again. This unique restriction site was used by Lu and Collins (2007) to insert a gene encoding a biofilm-degrading enzyme into T7. The two 5'-dephosphorylated genome fragments were ligated with various inserts. We have inserted synCG under the control of a constitutive T7 promoter and strong RBS and ending in a hairpin terminator. BL21 chemically competent E. coli were then transformed. A drop in OD was not observed, likely due to the low initial concentration of phage, so transformant cultures were plated by plaque assay. Phage genome was isolated from the plaques to PCR-detect the insert, and pregnancy tests are being used to detect the presence hCG and also validate phage modification.
Next steps
We propose a novel diagnostic for bacterial disease using engineered bacteriophage and pregnancy tests. We demonstrated that the synthetic version of hCG we designed, in the composite device we constructed to express it, successfully produces hCG detectable by $1 pregnancy tests in bacteria.

Background
In the previous year, the SZU-China team held the 2017 iGEM South China Regional Conference at Shenzhen University. After sharing the ideas with each team, most of them found it helpful for their experiment designs and project improvements.
With the experience and gains of the previous year, this year the SZU-China team continues to hold the meeting in the experiment preparation stage, hoping to gather ideas through the meeting and seek cooperation opportunities from each team.
Review
On May 6, 2018, we invited Sun Yat-Sen University, South China University of Technology B Team, Southern University of Science and Technology, Shenzhen Technician College, Shenzhen Middle School, Shenzhen High School, NPC High School and GBC team to our campus to have a meeting.
we are sharing with each other
2018 iGEM Southern China Regional Meetup
During the meeting, each team shared their thoughts and answered the questions to whom was interested in their projects.
After the presentations, all of us were welcomed to our canteen to have a lunch together. At lunch time, we met some new friends, had a deeper understanding of their projects and ideas. We also received the suggestions from other teams that made a great contribution to our later experiment.
In addition, we set up a group chat during our meeting. In the group chat, we share our problems we meet and get plenty of solutions from them during the whole iGEM competition. We also set up some collaborations to some of the teams like SUSTech_Shenzhen and SSHS-Shenzhen that participated in our meeting.

The idea behind the work of the transcriptomics group is to try and detect any changes in the gene expression when E. coli is grown alongside strongyles as opposed to just being grown in a normal lab environment. The aim for this undertaking is to find any and all genes which might be expressed exclusively in the proximity to the worms - giving us a prime opportunity to work some biotech magic and find a way to make a diagnostics tool for the strongyle parasites out of that very bacteria gene.
The way we decided to approach this was by running a full-scale transcriptome sequencing on the entire E. coli genome, both in bacteria grown normally and grown alongside the worms. By doing this, we would be able to quantitatively determine the differences in gene expression.
For this, we created an eight-step pipeline starting from lysing the bacteria to extracting their RNA contents, to refining and finally sequencing the genetic material using Oxford Nanopore’s MinION device - which you plug in to your laptop. That same laptop will then be used to understand what exactly is going on in the bacteria."

For example, rather than going through the litigation process of reducing the costs of Good Manufacturing Practice approval processes, or by investing into creating a new trading platform for public investment, we are providing a simple to produce insulin for up and running manufacturing plants to take on, or for manufacturing plants to be developed to produce these insulins.
We have specifically designed our expression systems such that there are three locations where the insulin will be accumulated. In E coli, we have insulin being accumulated in the cytoplasm and periplasm. In Bacillus, we hope to be able to purify straight from the media from secretory accumulation of Insulin. Through these methods we should be able to compare easily which worked, and which didn’t, and then the associated purification methods which simplified the process.
Furthermore, we have designed our own single chain insulin to help remove a lot of the post-purification methods associated with getting insulin into its active form. A series of di-sulphide bonds make it quite difficult to fold properly within bacterial cells. On top of that, for Proinsulin to become Insulin,  the C-chain must be removed. So, we’ve designed a single chain insulin with a small C chain linker which doesn’t need to be removed, and should also position the A and B chains more favorably to form the di-sulphides correctly.   Our solution is  by no means in isolation of other options also. Further down the track, following scaling up our production schemes, considerable efforts will be put into developing an open source pump to go alongside the insulins we have developed. Further efforts will then be put on to manufacturing contracts with medium-large scale plants to start pumping insulin out globally. On the side, efforts will also be put towards developing a gene therapy to ultimately cure diabetes in the mean time.
Economic Analysis of the Current Global Market, by Individual Country
From further analysis into the economic realm of insulin and diabetes, we decided to take a look at how people around the world could ""afford"" insulin, and which countries had individuals who could afford insulin in all percentiles of their household income distribution. We took data from government sources which outlined how much they subsidised an insulin vial, and insulin prices of one specific analogue were found in each respective country. Household income distributions were also collated from government statistical departments. Major difficulties were found in collecting data, especially in countries that do not publicise income distributions. Insulin prices were also hard to find, which we attributed to the fact that its a prescribed item.

4 - 10 August
Because the PCR products of NisA, PNisI and sfGFP(Bs) were lost during the purification and restriction in the week of 28 Juli - 3 August, the PCR was repeated for this genes, together with the genes that could not be amplified yet. This time a PCR was used that did not lower in  temperature, like the touchdown PCR, but that increased in temperature  with each step. This way it was hoped to get over the huge gap between the annealing temperature of the primer in the first cycle and the annealing temperature of the primer when the flap of the primer can also  anneal to the first PCR products. The temperature was set to increase from 40 &degC to 60 &degC in 20 cycles. Then, an additional 20 cycles were done at 65 &degC. The PCR was performed under standard conditions as was done before, together with a series of PCR that contained GC buffer (supplied with the Phusion DNA polymerase by Thermo Scientific), and a series of PCR with GC buffer and 1.5% DMSO. This time, with the help of Lisa, the PCR was finally successful for all genes.
11 - 17 August
The PCR on the BioBrick of the combined genes NisR and NisK was repeated because the yield of this product was very low after the PCR in the week of 4 - 10 August. The mixture of the previous PCR reaction was used as the template. The PCR was performed under standard conditions, with an annealing temperature of 64 &degC and 1 &mul, 2&mul and 3 &mul template. No product was obtained with this PCR. So the PCR was once again repeated, this time using diluted template. The mixture was diluted 50x, 300x, 1500x and 15000x. The PCR was repeated using 1 &mul and 2 &mul of each of the dilutions. This way, product was obtained for all reactions.
The PCR products of the genes NisA, NisB, NisC, NisRK, PNisI and sfGFP(Bs) were purified using the GeneJET purification kit. Then 1 &mug of each purified product was restricted with EcoRI and PstI, together with 1 &mug of the pSB"

4. Do the biological materials used in your lab work pose any of the following risks? Please describe.
a. Risks to the safety and health of team members or others working in the lab?
No.  According to the Final Risk Assessment of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) (1997), E. coli K-12 are not likely to pose any risk to human or animal health, to plants or to other microorganisms. In addition, we will use gloves and eye protected glasses during the experiments.
b. Risks to the safety and health of the general public, if released by design or by accident?
No. E. coli K-12 are not likely to pose any risk to human or animal health, to plants or to other microorganisms. Although strains we use in our lab work have antibiotic genes, but they can still be killed by other common antibiotics. We only use E. coli and we will have disinfection after the experiment.
c. Risks to the environment, if released by design or by accident?
No. Since E. coli K-12 are ubiquitous in the environment, they won't endanger any regular species in the environment.We only use E. coli and we will have disinfection after the experiment.
d. Risks to security through malicious misuse by individuals, groups, or countries?
No. We only have the directional optimization of promoters and use GFP to characterize them. GFP won't do any harm to the safety and health of the public and the environment.

UT-Tokyo,2014,Team:UT-Tokyo#Counter#Project#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," construction of resettable counter can be simplified. However, the simplified counter cannot reset from their final count.
</legend>
This simplified counter is made by only one sigma factor. In this construction, GFP without degradation tags is used. It works as the same way as original 2-counter until the first count. After the first count, crRNA coding GFP is transcribed at the downstream of Psigma. Then when the next arabinose induction occurs, GFP is translated. This expression can be considered a report of the second count. If GFP with degradation tag is used in this construction, GFP is decomposed after some time since GFP is translated only when taRNA exist. Thus GFP without degradation tag is used. This simplified counter can be also extended to the nth count. The simplified counter can count up to larger numbers compared to the original counter even when the same number of sigma factors are used, but cannot be reset from their final count. since half-life of GFP without degradation tag is too long. We performed our experiments on this simplified counter.
comparison with previous counter
Our σ-Re Counter is the improved version of the previous counter constructed by Ari.［1］In the previous counter, T7 RNA polymerase and T3 RNA polymerase was used as the counterpart of sigma factor in our counter Using sigma factors has two merits. One is the ability to make it easy to extend 2-counter for n-counters. The number of RNA polymerase derived from virus is limited, but there are many kinds of sigma factors. Consequently it is easier to construct n-counter by using sigma factor. Another advantage is the existence of inhibitors. Anti-sigma factors are inhibitors of sigma factors which has one-to-one correspondence. Inhibitors are necessary to realize reset functions.
Another difference is the positive feedback circuits whereas the previous counter design had no feedback circuits. Since sigma factors are more subject to degradation than RNA polymerase, the positive feedback circuits are necessary to keep ""memory"" (i.e. enable sigma factor to remain) in our counter.
<img src = ""
"" class = ""contTitle"" />
In a previous study[3], many sigma factors and anti-sigma factors that can regulate 1-to-1 transcription have been reported. Thus, a counter that has many states (count number) can be constructed. Even though in this project the reset function is simply a transition from other states to state 0, more general system that is capable of changing one state to any other states can be realized. Such system is clearly beyond a counter because it can have an input corresponding to any arbitrary transition between states. This system can be"

Complete chemical waste disposal training
Attend an orientation with Dr Jen Lee and Nikki Begg, part of the technical staff of the labs, regarding the University of York Health & Safety Regulations
Receive specific training from Dr Jen Lee and from Dr James Chong, our main supervisor, for the equipment in the lab
Complete a risk assessment form provided by Biological Safety Advisor (David Nelson)

Our standard lab practices were in compliance with the World Health Organization’s Biosafety Level 1 guidelines. Safety forms were approved on September 22, 2013, by Evan Appleton of behalf of iGEM. Many of our basic lab practices are described below.
Researchers were required to wear gloves while in the lab space, and to remove both gloves and wash their hands when going into the write-up area or in other lab common areas;
No gloves were allowed to leave the lab space, and no food or drink was allowed into the lab space, including the computer room;
Within the Department of Biology, microbiological samples were transported only via the internal service elevator and on lab-associated stairs which were accessed by card, to avoid contamination of public areas;
All flammable liquids were kept in a flammable storage cabinet;
The lab contained distinct waste containers for general waste, biohazard waste, biohazard sharps, and non-biohazard broken glassware;
Liquid bacterial waste was always autoclaved before being discharged into sanitary sewage;
Benchtops were decontaminated with ethanol before and after lab work was conducted;
Tools that came into contact with bacteria were soaked in ethanol and flame-treated before and after use;
An autoclave was used to decontaminate growth media, glassware, tubes, pipette tips, etc. All lab members were trained in preparing waste and media for being autoclaved. The actual autoclaving programs were run for us by the staff of the teaching labs, to avoid dangers to researcher safety;
An emergency shower, eyewash, and first aid kit were available within the lab space in case of emergency.
Dry ice was carried in iceboxes and thick gloves were used to take samples from them. Dry ice was left in the room to evaporate instead of disposing anywhere.

BFSUICC-China,2018,Team:BFSUICC-China#Team_-_-_TEXT.html," know more about biology in my spare time. I hope that I can make more friends and learn more about biology in this study and exchange activity.
My name is Wang Chenxi, and English name is Clarence, born in august 24, 2002. Grew up in Beijing. Currently I am studying in Beijing Foreign Studies University International Curriculum Center (BFSU ICC). Major subjects studied in school are biology and chemistry, but I am not very good at any of those. Beside riding bike and playing basketball, I don’t have any other hobbies. In the university I want to major in medicine or any subjects that are related to biology.
 
 
Hi, I am Tianyan Zhao and English name is Tina. I am from Beijing Foreign Studies University--ICC. This year is my first time to participate in iGEM. I am mainly responsible for Human paractice in the team. Usually I prefer sports, such as playing basketball. I think only sports can eliminate fatigut and bring motivation. This time, I am very happy to form an iGEM team with the school leaders. I hope we can cherish the process and enjoy the results.
I’m an international student in BFSUICC. Although I’m not studying biology, the knowledge of neuroscience and genetic engineering has a great attraction on me, therefore I decided to attend this competition. I enjoy the time that I spent in the lab, it brought me great surprise and fun to me.
Hello，everybody .I am Huang yilin, and I go by Lynn.I am 16 years old and I am currently study at Beijing Foreign Language Study University International Course Center.I have diverse hobbies.For instance, reading , watching films ，make journals ,cooking and so on.I asm a big fan of delicious food.As a result, beside seek for yummy food, another thing that I like do is keeping fit,Like running or swimming .It’s the first time I take part in IGEM, although the subjects that I study in school has no connection with biology.I enjoy the fun that biology bring to me.Thanks  guys!
 
Hello, I’m Deng Rui, a 16-year-old student from BFSU-ICC. I am a very casual person, and I like biochemistry, I am mainly responsible for experiments and various things in the team, what I like most is to soak in the laboratory, and operate all kinds of facilities or culture bacteria. Also, I like to discuss our project with the team, and I'm glad to have such a group of partners. I hope I can strengthen all my skills by participating IGEM and progresses"

When you get panicked and ossified with failed lab results, he can always calm you down by looking into the possible problems with you, no wonder his girlfriend’s heart got captivated!
Name:  Gary Ka Wing Yuen
Height: I'm tall; Weight: It's a secret! Belongs to the tetp group.
An active participant yet sometimes careless. He contributed to one of the proposal ideas which is about electric e.coli yet did not get to work out regrettably. Being one of the members in the modelling group, he studies really hard to ensure himself understand all the equations and concepts so that he can explain to the rest of us afterwards. By the way, let me tell you something, he is extraordinarily kind to his girlfriend in that he never goes Dutch when it comes to dating expenses.
Name: Janice Man Jing Wong
Height: I'm tall; Weight: It's a secret! Belongs to the tetp group.
She is always willing to learn, work and contribute, which makes her one of the valuable members in our team. While others are arguing for whatever reasons, she is always the first one going back to work and leaving us behind. Not only is she a hard-working member, she is also willing to take up extra duties with the most justifiable reason: I’m free anyway.
Name: Joyce On Ki Wong
Height: I'm tall; Weight: It's a secret! Belongs to the tetp group.
The Learner. Joyce is a very hardworking and diligent person. She always asks anybody else if she has any doubts or questions. She is very humble and her presence always brings joy and happiness. She’s talkative and very interested in psychology! Also, we don’t need to worry about running out of LB or LB plates if she’s around!

Cambridge,2012,Team:Cambridge#Diary#TheFinalMonth_-_-_TEXT.html," Biologger, a *cheap, arduino-based, fully functional automatic rotary device* that has an incorporated ratiolumnometer
Our project is entirely open-sourced and open-platform. We have published source code for the two applications which serve to operate the device, one for PCs and the other for Android devices, as well as the open source circuit design that provides this ratiometric reading. Furthermore, the Android app is able to receive its data wirelessly, which we feel is a great advance in BioBrick measurement.
Our dual-channel luciferase reporter was successfully tested with a dilution series of E.coli transformed with the Lux Operon (under pBAD) biobrick (Part  BBa_K325909) of the Cambridge iGEM 2010 team. It can detect, with good accuracy, both different light intensities, as well as the percentages of blue or orange frequencies in a sample.
Our device was successfully tested using artificial light to detect different frequencies (colours) as well.
Having done all the above, we believe that this fully open-sourced instrumentation kit (mechanical) chassis, electronics, software code), estimated at *$35.00* (or $85.00 if a Bluetooth modem is required), is a complete BioBrick measurement solution for any and all BioBricks with a light output.

As a riboswitch sensing construct, this part is an entirely new type of biosensor (along with the fluoride construct) that could potentially change the way we think about designing input genetic circuits. Unlike the fluoride riboswitch, it is a derepression system and therefore serves to demonstrate the principle that riboswitches can be used regardless of whether they turn on or off their reporter.

⇒ Results from very crude IPTG induction assay from 8/17/2011 yielded promising results. 16.5 hours later two plates full of red colonies were obtained, and a passing lab member correctly identified the plate contained IPTG from the shade of red alone.
∴It seems that there is enough protein production that exchanging the lacI promoter for a T7 promoter in the final construct may not be necessary.

So both of biobrick BBa_K515102 and our biobrick BBa_K1405004 have chemotaxis towards malate, and other McpS with the conserved sequence may response to the same ligand. And if we slice the conserved sequence of different chemoreceptors responding to other TCA intermediates, we may gain a super E. coli Prometheus who can respond to more universal root exudates.
Table 1. Properties of the model
Fig.7 (A) The structure of malate and succinate, and the thermodynamic parameters for the 2 compounds that were found to bind. (B and C) View of the interaction of malate (B) and succinate (C) with the McpS-LBR. Malate binds to a cavity formed by α1 and the C-terminal segment of α6, and its coordination is achieved through interactions with R60, R63, R254, and T258 from one monomer and Q65 from the other monomer. Residues R60, R63, and Q65 form part of helix α1, whereas R254 and T258 are part of α6. Succinate binds to McpS-LBR in an almost identical manner as malate. Unlike malate, succinate has no hydroxyl group at C2. Therefore, the two hydrogen bonds that are established between the malate hydroxyl group, and the protein cannot be formed in the succinate structure. The remaining interactions of succinate with R60, R63, R254, and Q65 are analogous to the malate structure where they establish six hydrogen bonds.

Prodigiosin pigment
- UV protecting properties
- synthesis controlled by quorum sensing
- absorbs in UV range from 240 to 400 nm as well as in the visible spectrum from 400 to 600 nm
- also antibiotic and anti-cancer (induces NAG-1 pro-apoptotic gene in human breast cancer cells)
- Prodigiosin biosynthesis gene cluster (pig cluster) contains ~15 ORFs in Serratia strains (Harris et al., 2004)
- PigS and PigP regulate prodigiosin biosynthesis in Serratia (Gristwood et al., 2011)
- Streptomyces griseoviridis 2464-S5 produces prodigiosin R1, gene cluster of 24 open reading frames, including 21 genes (rphD-rphZ) homologous to prodigiosin biosynthesis genes in the red cluster in Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2). The expression of rphN in S. coelicolor lacking redN restored the production of prodigiosin (Kawasaki et al., 2009)
- could also be used as a dye in clothing. pigment production from microorganisms by large-scale fermentation would be environmentally friendly and sustainable. Could make clothes with inherent UV protection, but they would all be red.... (Text by Nikki)
Sci-Fi prodigiosin ideas (developed by Rebekka, Nick and CJ from the RCA):
-use prodigiosin (red pigment) as the new ""colour of health"" (know something is sterile rather than assume it is)
-possible future uses: in decontamination/ as a ""panic room""/ sterile hospice
-possible future products: hand gel, clothing (e.g. protective suits in bioreactor plants), decontamination paint (in hospitals etc)
-actual uses: anti-cancer (could be in a red drip, red pill?), anti-malarial (drug verification because pigment colour is hard to fake)
Eventually, this idea was scratched because optimising the production pathway does not contain enough synthetic biology. In addition, the compound is immunosuppressive ( http://pubs.rsc.org/en/Content/ArticleHtml/2008/CC/b719353j ) and would therefore be disadvantageous to normal people. Many of the envisaged applications would only work with less problematic analogues of prodig"

Penn_State,2014,Team:Penn State#CodonOptimization_-_-_TEXT.html," thought of as an extra dial that can be tuned to rationally control output of genetic systems.
Background
Codon optimization refers to the idea that the individual codons of a gene in a specific organism can be changed in order to alter the behavior of that organism. This relies on an understanding of the central dogma of biology, which states that any organism produces proteins by first transcribing genetic material in the form of DNA to RNA, which is then “read” by ribosomes which produce proteins based on the sequence of amino acids in that RNA. The reading of the RNA is done three nucleotides at a time, and these three letter series of nucleotides are called codons. Codons specify to the ribosome which amino acid to add to a growing amino acid chain.
There are 4 nucleotides, thus 43, or 64 codons are possible.  Since there are only 20 amino acids, there is redundancy in the codons, that is, some amino acids are specified by multiple codons. There is no ambiguity, however, meaning that each codon specifies only one amino acid.  Codons that code for the same amino acid are called degenerate codons, and even though these degenerate codons code for the same amino acid, they do not necessarily lead to the same expression levels of that amino acid.
Degenerate codons do not necessarily lead to equally efficient expression of an amino acid.
Our Objectives
1) Find Criteria for Optimizing Genes in E. coli
All coding sequences were designed so that there would be no difference between the amino acid profile of the variant GFP and the original superfolder GFP. This ensured that each gene led to the expression of the same protein.
Previous researchers have determined through a statistical analysis of the entire genome that some degenerate codons occur more often in protein coding sequences and some are more infrequent. These are referred to as common and rare codons. The importance of this is that protein expression in cells is limited either by either translation initiation rate (TIR) or translation elongation rate, and it is theorized that commonly occurring codons will have faster elongation rates than degenerate rare codons. Translation initiation rate can be artificially controlled by varying the strength of the ribosome binding site (RBS), which consists of the genetic sequence that precedes the protein coding sequences (CDS) of a gene. This is accomplished through the use of the RBS calculator, and in previous research was used to steadily increase the RBS strength of a gene, GFP mut3b, the expression of which was then characterized.

SULSA TALKS
In June SULSA (Scottish Universities Life Sciences Alliance) held a conference in Dundee     and on the second day, the Scottish iGEM teams had the opportunity to present our project      ideas to each other. This was our very first opportunity to pitch our project idea, and it was     great to get some feedback from the Edinburgh and Glasgow team as well as find out about their projects.
UK MEET UP
The UK meet up was held by the University of Westminister’s iGEM team.     The whole team travelled down to London for this event and presented our project.     This was a nice practice before the big event in Boston and a fantastic experience.     We chatted with familiar faces from Edinburgh and Glasgow and met some of the other     teams from the rest of the UK.
AALTO-HELSINKI
Near the start of the summer the Aalto-Helsinki team got in touch with us and we arranged to chat over skype.      We described our projects to each other and discussed different methods for modelling enzyme kinetics.
BIELEFELD-CEBITEC
We collaborated with team Bielefeld-CeBiTec who are also constructing a chromate sensor based on the chromate resistance operon of Ochrbrobactrum tritici 5bvl1. However, we are using the part in very different contexts and configurations.      Team Bielefeld is using a chromate sensor to detect the contamination of drinking water, whereas we using it     to detect traces of stainless steel. This opened the door for our collaboration. We shared our results and     exchanged our constructs so that we could also test the other’s systems. They helped characterise our chromium sensor by testing our codon optimized sensor in their in vitro system for cell-free protein synthesis.
AIX-MARSAILLE
We answered some questions that the Aix-Marseille team had regarding the twin-arginine      translocation (Tat) pathway. They wanted to know whether we thought it would be possible to      transport something with a tat signal linked to something else with a secretory pathway (Sec)      signal together through the Tat system. Using knowledge from Tracy Palmers lab at the university,     we were able to advise them that this approach is unlikely to work and offered an alternative approach      to try.

Abstract
“Every 7 seconds one person dies from diabetes” (IDF, 2014). Among others, Type 1 Diabetes is the result of a partial or complete lack of insulin production that leads to deregulation of glucose levels in blood. Current available solutions for this disorder are based on complicated and expensive devices of external use. We propose the use of an innovative system based on the construction of a bacterial sensor capable to respond to glucose concentrations; secondly this sensor aims to induce the production of insulin according to glucose levels. The bacteria are going to be contained in a modular device composed by contention, communication, extraction and change sections. For the design of the device, a bio-compatible material was searched. This device is designed specifically to prevent an immune response of the patient. The system designed combines mechanical engineering and biotechnology, ensuring an appropriate and secure insulin dosage for the patient.
Diabetes mellitus is a metabolic disease characterized by the loss or alteration of the capability to regulate blood sugar levels (glycemia). Among other types of diabetes, type 1 diabetes (and in some cases type 2) can be treated by insulin dosage to the patient, which must be highly regulated.  The ways of administering insulin are many, but the least uncomfortable happen to be the most expensive ones and all of them imply changes in the quality of life of the patient. Regarding to insulin production at industrial levels, it has been predicted that insulin large scale production technologies could be insufficient to satisfy the demand, so it’s still a challenge to improve the ways this protein is produced.  For these reasons, it is our main goal to develop a device capable of sensing glucose levels and to produce insulin in response.
How could it be possible?
The idea is to integrate bacterial populations capable of doing the job within a special compartment .
The Design~
This project is an integrative work of students from different areas including engineering, biology, chemistry, medical, biomedical and genomic sciences.
For the device’s design, biocompatible materials were searched in order to be capable of containing the bacteria as well as allowing glucose levels’ information to pass through it and reach the bacteria, but this container also aims to prevent bacterial physical contact with the exterior.
About the bacterial populations job, we are building a circuit that consists of 2 mains parts:
One capable of measuring blood glucose levels
The other capable of synthesize and excrete right folded insulin

Calgary,2010,Team:Calgary#Community#Podcasts#Transcripts_-_-_TEXT.html," achieve a bronze or silver medal. For one, your team needs to describe your project on your team wiki, you can view ours at https://2010.igem.org/Team:Calgary. Both Calgary and Team needs to be capitalized. We also need to present a poster, and talk at the jamboree, and we need to submit a new bio brick to the Registry of Parts.
Alex: Yeah that’s right, all the genetic sequences that code for the parts that we create our projects with have been standardized into something we call a biobrick. Every biobrick has the same prefix and suffix made of restriction sites. This allows every biobrick to be put together into a “circuit” that we can then transform into a host such as e coli, which will then use those sequences to carry out their function.
Dev: O.K. so every bio brick can be cut, and then put together using the same enzymes and sites?
Alex: Yep, Biobricks have been likened to lego bricks, every piece has the same sized holes on the bottom and top so that you can easily put them together and build whatever you and your team have dreamt up.
Dev: Well that makes it sound pretty easy to create these biological circuits; it wouldn’t be very hard to teach anyone how to put these systems together.
Alex: iGEM is making synthetic biology much easier to access, opening it to thousands of undergraduate students. And the creation of standardized biobricks isn’t the only aspect of iGEM that is making synthetic biology easier and more accessible; it also has created the Registry of Standard Biological Parts.
Dev: Yeah the Registry of Standard Biological Parts is a collection of these interchangeable biobrick parts that are made available to iGEM teams and certain academic labs. It runs on a “get some, give some” basis, meaning that everyone who benefits from being able to access this collection of parts to create integrated biological systems, will also then contribute to the registry by providing information on the parts they use, and submit new parts which contain the biobrick prefix and suffix.
Alex: So how many parts does this registry have?
Dev: Well the registry was created in 2003 at M.I.T, by 2004 it had accumulated about 100 parts such as protein coding sequences, and devices built from these parts. This is because assembly of parts into devices and systems can then be put back into the registry so that others can use it to improve their own projects. Now with the growth of iGEM, the registry contains 2000 defined parts,"

Ontario iGEM (OGEM)
iGEM Toronto together with Queens iGEM, Waterloo iGEM, McMaster iGEM, uOttawa iGEM and Ryerson iGEM had the opportunity to present our iGEM projects at the 66th annual Canadian Society of Microbiologists conference. This year, we had two meetings as Ontario iGEM (OGEM) to share information/advice, and to dicuss collaborations. We collaborated together, with the help of Ontario Genomics, to work on developing a Synthetic Biology Network with the purpose of connecting synthetic biologists across the province and Canada.
Cardiff iGEM
We hosted a panel discussion event at the University of Toronto to discuss the current state of synthetic biology and the implications of using GMO technologies in real world applications. We invited Christian Donohoe from Cardiff iGEM as a panelist to talk about their iGEM project and also to provide an international perspective.

After this we start spreading the game: we wrote about it on our facebook and twitter, on RPGmaker forums, on facebook school pages, we spoke with our friends, family etc.
We also offer the diffusion of the game as a collaboration with other iGEM groups: if they advertised the game in at least four different internet groups with at least 50 people on everyone, they could get this medal as a prove of their collaboration.
We gave this medal to Teams TecMonterrey and Valencia_Biocampus. By the time of the wiki freeze, we have reached 440 people with the Spanish version. The English version wasn’t properly outreached due to lack of time: if we reach the jamboree at the MIT, we are going to distribute it all over the world!
In total, that means that 440 people know now about SynBio because of our game, and that only with Spanish native speakers! Who knows how much people are we going to be able to reach with our newly finished English version!.

We intend to develop a fast screening technique for different invasive fungi, such as Aspergillus fumigatus, Candida albicans and Aspergillus nidulans. The idea is to tag the invasive fungal cells with a special protein marker. By modifying the protein marker with a proper signal molecule, we will be able to accomplish a fast and direct elimination of invasive fungi.

We look for accountability of funds and full transparency that funds are spent according to the purpose, for which they were given. It is no secret that the governments of many countries are corrupted, and that the lack of oversight enables it to be viable.
We hope that this will motivate industries to partner with these organizations and compete for putting effective solutions out there, thus creating a healthy industry while still prioritizing safety.
We have so far considered potential partners, endorsers and funders such as UNDP: United Nations development programme, WHO incentive on developing a roadmap for neglected tropical disease, Doctors Without Borders (Medical sans frontiers). We project relying on  academia and University research grants for funding for our research and development of the prototype. Once, developed beyond a sufficient level, we are considering getting Impact investors on board, that are facilitating investment made into companies with the intention to generate a measurable beneficial social or environmental impact alongside a financial return.
Competition, running out of effective antivenom and inferior replacements
One issue is that countries in Sub Saharan Africa rely on imports from cheaper indian and chinese pharmaceuticals. These suppliers are able to  that usually carry antivenoms with inferior quality and an increased number of side effects due to the improper manufacturing process employed for the cheaper alternatives. In addition to issues of proper supply chain management of pharmaceutical in Africa [4].
This has resulted in significant casualties as in the case of Chad and Ghana that has seen a rise in envenoming related fatalities from a mere 2.3% to 15% [5].
Established quality antivenom suppliers have difficulties penetrating the marked as of late. Even with these suppliers having been endorsed and used by Non governmental organizations such as Doctors Without Borders.
A study carried out investigating the doses of antivenom both in vitro and through preclinical testing of antivenoms found that none of the six commonly employed antivenoms were effective, either due to unspecificity of the venom or due to that the dosing recommendations of the supplier were significant lower than necessary for treatment [6].
Independent testing
Taking our own solution into perspective, we will have to be very transparent with all the issues that come with such a device, such as the percentage likelihood of false positives, and -negatives, the accuracy of the test, in addition to accounting for stability and storage, as one would any other product. This means rigorous testing and declaration of any conflicting interests.

UMaryland,2016,Team:UMaryland#Model_-_-_TEXT.html,"biology runs fairly smoothly, so we’ll leave it to you to figure out the rest. Best of luck!
After we created the basic architecture for our two models, we experimented with various parameters to optimize our pathway.
Optimization and Parameter Scanning
We analyzed the contributions of three different parameters on the viability of our pathways: methanol tolerance, methane concentration, and presence of an Activator protein, ACT.
Parameter 1: Methanol tolerance
Methanol, formaldehyde, and formate are toxic substrates produced by the methane digestion pathways. As our project stands, each pathway is cloned so that the enzymes are expressed in 1:1 ratios. Under these circumstances, formaldehyde and formate do not build up in the cell. However, because the MDH2 enzyme has a relatively large Km of 360,000 μM, methanol builds up to a toxic concentration. MDH2 must therefore be expressed at a higher cellular concentration than sMMO so that methanol production does not significantly outpace methanol consumption.
Team Aachen 2015, which worked to upcycle methanol into a universal carbon source, indicated that their E. coli survived methanol concentrations at up to 1.6M. By modifying the ratio of sMMO and MDH2 enzymes, we simulated the efficiency of our pathway under conditions of increased methanol production.
Simulations were run to determine the equilibrium concentration of methanol at various sMMO to MDH2 ratios. We found that at a ratio of 300 mg to 217.3 mg respectively, methanol concentration reaches an equilibrium of 0.5M. By running a multitude of these simulations, and tracking the amount of carbon dioxide produced over a set time period, we were able to conclude that Increasing the sMMO to MDH2 ratio beyond 300 mg to 217.3 mg will not significantly improve methane degradation (as indicated by carbon dioxide production).
Sidenote: Because the reaction catalyzed by MDH2 forms a bottleneck in our pathway, we concluded that MDH2 should be expressed at the greatest concentration. We determined the peak enzyme concentration to be 5.3 μM because Team Braunschweig 2014 experimentally calculated that their part, which used the same backbone, promoter, and ribosome binding site that we used for all our parts, expressed protein at 5.3 μM. Expression for every other enzyme is tuned based on the fact that MDH2 concentration is 5.3 μM (217.3 mg per liter).
We sought to optimize the ratio of MDH"

Public releases: Purdue Biomakers releases, which they send to people that are interested in their work and circulate through departments on campus to raise awareness.
What We Provided In Return
In return for the documents and feedback provided by Purdue, we provided feedback on their club's organization and structure, their internship application, their Learning Objectives and, most importantly, we provided information on the course that our faculty mentors are currently developing so that Purdue's faculty-taught course can modify and improve where they see fit.
To see the full feedback that we provided for the Purdue Biomakers, please visit Purdue's team Wiki!
How We Integrated Feedback and Materials
We took the materials from Purdue Biomakers and used them in numerous ways. Most notably, we used Purdue's Constitution as a starting platform for the creation of our own official, registered student organization at the University of Iowa. By formally recognizing our team as a student organization, we gained access to additional funding opportunities and fairs, etc. where we could showcase our work to the student body and raise awareness, thus generating interest from a greater number of students.
In early August, our faculty began the process to register and develop the first ever synthetic biology course at the University of Iowa (!!!). This was great news for the students on campus who, before now, had no opportunities to engage in the discipline. With Purdue's supplied Learning Objectives, the course plan was improved and structured in a manner that took their feedback into account.
From the internship application supplied by Purdue's iGEM team, we were able to take a look at our own methodologies for keeping students in the laboratory. This year, the majority of our students worked in the lab on a volunteer basis, which we learned may not be the standard for other teams. Though we had great participation despite now being able to pay all of our students, we would love to, in the future, have dedicated funds to provide summer stipends to the undergraduate team members.  Ultimately, these funds would have to come from sponsors at the University of Iowa or from a partnership with industry, but we look forward to the challenge. With Purdue's application structure in place, our first attempt to fund students through competitive internships (hopefully next year) should go quite smoothly.
Take-away Points
With Purdue's insights, we were able to enact the following as a first-year iGEM team:
-Our faculty developed an official lab course in synthetic biology, the first of its kind at the University of Iowa.

It can also describe the species constructed by these parts, and reactions happen with the species, such as binding of species, dilution of species, degradation of proteins, amplification of cells, multi-compartment reactions, and so on.
Many traditional methods fail to consider structure of species when trying to markup reactions with only reactants, modifiers, products and kinetic laws. The best part of MoDeL is that it can preserve detailed structure in species and reactions using Chain-Node Model. Based on the model, MoDeL is able to markup almost all kinds of reactions in a detailed and clear way.
Overview of MoDeL
Figure 5 above is an example of a simple network of biochemical reactions(pTetR + TetR2 = pTetR*:TetR2) that can be automatically constructed using MoDeL:
MoDeL supports automatic construction of such network with only the input of its initial conditions and environmental parameters. In order to do this, obviously the data of parts, species, reactions, compartment, units and so on is needed. Besides, relationships between these components are also needed, so we can link to a reaction when we find a species. Data of relationship is stored as references and exists in most MoDeL components.
To define all the needed components in a systematic way, MoDeL organizes them in five component containers at the top level:
:: System: This container contains definitions of units, functions, rules and global parameters. These are all basic elements for other components of MoDeL, and many are mathematical concepts without direct synthetic biology meanings. The name of the container, System, separates this container from others which contains components of biological significance, and indicates this container includes the basic parameters of the whole system.
:: Compartment: This container contains definitions of compartments. Compartment here is considered as a holder of substance with certain volume, so it only stores related data such as units and volume. It also stores a list of compartments that are permitted to be placed inside. For compartments like E.coli that can multiply, a corresponding compartment with the same id will be created in the sub-container of compartment in Part.
:: Part: This container contains definitions of parts. Part includes the basic units that can be inserted in an abstract chain. The container of Part has five sub-containers which are: compartment, biobrick, compound, plasmidBackbone, and substituent. Biobrick contains biobricks from PartsRegistry together with other similar components created by users. Compartment contains cells and"

First of all, we are all undergraduates, our supervisors gave us advice and feedback but did not perform any dry or wet work. We did receive lab instructions by Martijn van Rosmalen, who is a PhD at our university. He gave us instructions on how to work with yeast and gave valuable advice when some of the wet work did not go according to plan.
All wiki content was created by the team, only the template from Cambridge 2009 was used and altered.
The animation on the home page was created in cooperation with the ICMS Animation Studio.
The workshop we gave at the Discovery Festival was developed in cooperation with the following teams: Wageningen_UR, Amsterdam and Groningen. During several meetings we developed an outset for the workshop and eventually divided the three locations of the festival among the teams. The team of Amsterdam went to the location in Amsterdam, the teams of Wageningen and Groningen went to Rotterdam and we ended up in our hometown Eindhoven.
Our control device was created in cooperation with the Equipment & Prototype Center of the Eindhoven University of Technology. The design was made by our device team and the device was created by the before-mentioned center.
The GECO proteins were created by the group of Robert Campbell who kindly gave us permission to create BioBricksTM of these proteins.
The MID1/CCH1 sequence containing vectors were provided by Hidetoshi Iida.

About Us
Our team consists of 11 students and 2 supervisors (Jana Herrmann and Frank Groß). We are biologists, bioengineers and biochemists. If you want to know a little bit more about us, you can read some information on this site.
Jana
Jana studied Molecular Biotechnology in Dresden and Munich. From biophysics to biochemistry to chemistry, she has been working on projects in different disciplines. However, her favorite discipline has always been Molecular Bioengineering. Therefore, she is happy to support the TU Dresden team to get SPACE-P into the orbit of iGEM. Being outside the lab, she enjoys the nature while hiking or cycling, and for working off energy – if something is left at the end of a busy week – she likes playing badminton. She says: “The iGEM competition is a great opportunity for the students to get a feeling of what it takes to plan and perform a project (also from the organizational and financial side) and to realize that having know-how is beneficial, but having a good network is as important.”
Frank
Frank studied biology at the Universtät Hohenheim and got his PhD at the TU Dresden. After three years as a postdoc with Syngenta at the Research Triangle Park, North Carolina, USA, he returned to Germany. He is interested in natural products, molecular bioengineering and lately in epigenetics due to group affiliation. “To be asked by the students to supervise the Dresden iGEM team is a honor. It was and is a hard learning process for all of us, since we are all novices in the iGEM hemisphere. Nevertheless, this project is a great opportunity for them to learn how science functions: planning a project, writing proposals to get funding and finally realizing the plans at the bench in the wet lab and present the results.”

Abstract
The Tristable switch was derived from advanced studies of other synthetic networks like toggle switches and oscillators. We think it would be helpful to create a synthetic network which produces distinct signals under specific induction. We hope to create a biological device that could perform three discrete, but alternating, steady states driven by three different repressible promoters. The presence of a transient pulse of inducer allows effective state shifting, while preventing signal interference. During data-mining, we noticed that iGEM Team Brown University has tried to build tristable switches in 2006 and 2007 but had low outputs. Therefore, we troubleshot and investigated improvements that can be applied to their design."

The cells transfected with pAct5C-GAL4 DNA and pUAS-LacZ DNA were fixed with cold methanol for 20 min or 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min. After fixation, cells were washed with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS, then masked with 5% normal goat serum in PBS for 1 hour. Then the monoclonal anti-beta galactosidase antibody (X500 dilution in PBS containing 5% normal goat serum) was added to the fixed cells and incubated for 16 hours at 4℃.
September 23rd
After incubation with the first antibody, the cells were washed with PBS (three times for 10 min each). Then the Alexa-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (X400 dilution in PBS containing 5% normal goat serum) added to the cells and incubate for 4 hours at 4℃. After washing with PBS (three times for 10 min each), cells were mounted with mounting medium in DAPI and examined under the confocal lazer microscope (Olympus, Fv10i). Results: 10.1% cells co-transfected with pAct5C-GAL4 DNA and pUAS-LacZ DNA were observed to be LacZ-positive, while no LacZ-positive cell was detected for the negative control cells, indicating that the P-element plasmid, pUAS-LacZ DNA, Biobrick part (BBa_K758005) is truly functional in Drosophila cells. We therefore decided to send this plasmid to iGEM Headquarters.
After 72 hours incubation, the cells transfected with pAct5C-GAL4 DNA and pUAS-EGFP DNA were examined under the confocal lazer microscope (Olympus, Fv10i). Results were nearly the same as those after 48 hours incubation.
