Freiburg,2013,Team:Freiburg#Project#unibox_-_-_TEXT.html,"-VP16 activation system will also be inducible at 632 nm instead of 660 nm.
Figure 1: Spectrum of the uniBOX LED light chain
The LED light chain was set to white light and the spectra of all three RBG LEDs were measured.
As proof of principal for an activation at 632 nm we illuminated a 10 cm culture dish containing CHO-K1 cells. Another plate was kept in dark for control. The results can bee seen in figure 2. For both plates the same exposure time was used. Cells illuminated with 630 nm red light for 1 h show a strong mCherry signal compared to the control plate. The weak fluorescence of the control plate is due to the leakiness of the CMV minimal promotor.
Figure 2: Red light induced mCherry expression (left) compared to a dark controle (right).
CHO-K1 cells were either illuminated with red light in the uniBOX (left) or kept completely in dark (right). The rasters seen in the right picture are due to the scanning of the cells via a fluorescent microscope and due of the weak mCherry signal.
Spatio-temporal gene expression
The best results for spatio-temporal gene expression were achieved by illuminating CHO-K1 cells for 1 h with an intensity of about 0.02 - 0.1 µE using red LEDs. In general a 10 cm culture dish with an even and dense cell distribution was illuminated through an edit format. Therefore only small parts of the plate were covered in light resulting in a production of mCherry. This method allowed us to write the word ""iGEM"" (Figure 3), to draw a heart (Figure 4) and even to display a rudimental iGEM logo (Figure 5) within the cells.
Figure 3: Red light driven mCherry production in CHO-K1 cells using spatio-temporal gene expression
3.5x10^6 cells were seeded and transfected with tetR-pif, vp16-phyB and mCherry reporter. The illumination was proceeded at 0.5 µE for 1 h through an ""iGEM"" edit format (top picture). The right picture is showing the fluorescence of mCherry and was proceeded using imageJ with a Gaussian Blur(1.0) and by adjusting intensity and contrast. The word ""iGEM"" is readable within the cells.

Circadian rhythm control over biological processes is pervasive among multicellular eukaryotes and cyanobacteria, suggesting a common evolved network motif and a strong evolutionary advantage for anticipating regular fluctuations in the environment.
To uncover the mysteries of the biological evolution of the circadian rhythm system, our project combines non-circadian single-cell eukaryotic Saccharomyces cerevisiae with the circadian clock of autotrophic circadian cyanobacteria. According to the concept of “understanding by creating (creating is understanding)” in synthetic biology, a new biological clock system has been established in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which has inspired a series of follow-up studies and novel applications of our project.
Project
We successfully reconstructed the KaiABC circadian clock in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, predicting by modeling, regulating by expression control and characterizing its oscillation by yeast two-hybrid system. A bold attempt is made to explore how the oscillator can impact chromatin structure in yeast. These results demonstrate that the heterologous circadian oscillator is transplantable for metabolic pathway study as well as wide-ranging applications.
Safety
Although the project barely involves genetic pollution or the use of toxic reagents, our instructor still attaches great importance to the lab safety during the experiment. Before entering the lab, every operator must accept comprehensive training and have a deep understanding of equipment and reagents. All wastes are divided and gathered into special bottles, later get handled by professionals in a unified manner.
Human Practice
We made a survey about the circadian clock to investigate the potential impact to society and conducted follow-up market research on possible application. Furthermore, we were devoted to spreading iGEM idea to every age group. We made a picture book and performed a TV show for children, invited teenagers and parents to our lab and displayed biology to hundreds of tourists on the Begonia Festival. Synthetic biology can be a popular science by our actual action.

Freiburg,2012,Team:Freiburg#HumanPractices#Education_-_-_TEXT.html," We wanted to give the children a first impression in the tiny, but amazing world of cell biology by learning through their own action. Using a microscope connected to a computer, we showed the children some cells and explained them the general concept of a cell, the smallest unit of life. After looking at the cells through the microscope the children learned the 'first steps' of genetics. Using a plastic model as a prop, we explained in easy terms the way DNA is responsible for the correct functioning and welfare of the cell. To make this rather abstract idea graspable for the kids, we showed how to extract DNA from common vegetables. In this way it was possible for them to actually see the mysterious DNA, which constantly works within their own bodies.
On three different occasions we were able to work with quite inquisitive groups of children and introduced them to the field of synthetic biology:
I. At the ‘Wissens-Tage Baden-Württemberg’ (Knowledge-days of Baden-Württemberg) in the city of Neuenburg, Germany. (3th -4th March 2012)
II. At the ‚Sommerfest’ of the city of Freiburg, Germany. (22th September 2012)
III. At the ‘Science Days’ in the ‘Europa-Park’ , Rust, Germany. (11th-13th October 2012)
It was really nice to witness the exaltation in the children's faces when using the microscope and to see all those smiles during DNA-extraction. The positive feedback we got is a clear sign of the great time the children and all of us had.
2.2 High school students
2.2.1 Presentations for high school students
For us iGEM is indeed a great opportunity for working and learning in a lab, but also a good chance to promote and discuss synthetic biology. In this vein, we decided to teach students the basic ideas of synthetic biology and our project in order to inspire them and enhance their motivation for the study of life sciences. Two of our team members visited a biotechnological high school in Freiburg ( Merian-Schule ) and the Freiburg-Seminar , a central organization of the city to promote talented students. During our visit we talk about:
Synthetic biology in general
iGEM and our project
Possibilities of synthetic biology
Risks, concerns and social implications
The students and teachers were amazed by the bright prospects of synthetic biology, but also concerned about the risks of it. Although our presentation was not able to reply to all"

We also decided to transform RBS (pA13CZ) off of a kit plate for subsequent miniprepping/digestion/ligation with GFP and mRFP. The T7 promoter needs a ribosomal binding site in order to express in E. coli. We then retried the ligation of pAK13D with mRFP using a 6:1 insert to vector ratio. We attempted to protoplast a huge chunk of mycelium, but had difficulty forming a pellet again. At this point, we decided to enlist the help of Professor Gillian Turgeon, who performs fungal transformations in her lab. We made some hygromycin plates to test transformants, and digested pAh13G with Sph1 to linearize, but this time we column purified the product.
Homologous regions were successfully appended to PgpdA, and cloning of the Cre recombinase appeared to be successful. We made another attempt at protoplasting, which was again unsuccessful. For characterization, we began cloning RBS into our constructs containing T7, since the promoter need a ribosomal binding site to express in E. coli.

We ran a Gibson assembly of pC13F and G. lucidum PgpdA to create pC13BH and then transformed and plated the new construct. As our previous attempts to append BamHI and KpnI cut sites to pC13F failed, we again ran another PCR, but tried using four times the amount of dNTPs. We ran a PCR of pC13CJ once again from the cultures. The gel looks good for colony 4 and okay for colony 3. We will miniprep colony 4 and send it in for sequencing. We also made five 5ml liquid LB cultures of pA13CZ and miniprepped pC13AQ. We ran a digest screen of select pC13F+pC13BJ, pC13F+pC13BK, pC13F+pC13BL, pC13F+pc13BM colonies with EcoRI and SpeI. Our initial gel didn’t show inserts (lengths of 130 and 230 base pairs) so we ran a second gel with 2% agarose.

Part Documentation
Each team will make new parts during iGEM and will submit them to the Registry of Standard Biological Parts. The iGEM software provides an easy way to present the parts your team has created. The <groupparts> tag (see below) will generate a table with all of the parts that your team adds to your team sandbox.
Remember that the goal of proper part documentation is to describe and define a part, so that it can be used without needing to refer to the primary literature. Registry users in future years should be able to read your documentation and be able to use the part successfully. Also, you should provide proper references to acknowledge previous authors and to provide for users who wish to know more.
Note
Note that parts must be documented on the Registry . This page serves to showcase the parts you have made. Future teams and other users and are much more likely to find parts by looking in the Registry than by looking at your team wiki.
Adding parts to the registry
You can add parts to the Registry at our Add a Part to the Registry link.
We encourage teams to start completing documentation for their parts on the Registry as soon as you have it available. The sooner you put up your parts, the better you will remember all the details about your parts. Remember, you don't need to send us the DNA sample before you create an entry for a part on the Registry. (However, you do need to send us the DNA sample before the Jamboree. If you don't send us a DNA sample of a part, that part will not be eligible for awards and medal criteria.)
What information do I need to start putting my parts on the Registry?
The information needed to initially create a part on the Registry is:
Part Name
Part type
Creator

Those activities included free debate about the better research method of synthetic biology, “Quiz King” (synthetic biology Q&A competition), and iGEM life salon.
It is worth mentioning that, before the conference, many attendees were under great pressure of doing experiment and other preparation for the Jamboree. During the conference, this pressure might even be deepened by listening to other teams’ presentations and, possibly, the terrible weather condition in Wuhan. But these fun activities significantly expelled the worried looks on attendees’ faces. Especially in the final part of iGEM life salon, Professor Chen Wenliang from NCTU_Formosa shared his idea of “enjoy science”. He reminded us that whether win a medal or not was not important comparing to whether you had fun in this experience. It was more convincing with a positive attitude and a smile on your face to show the judge that you had benefited a lot from this experience. And with this attitude, it wouldn’t be hard at all to fulfill the project and claim a medal. All the attendees were deeply moved by this idea and the true meaning of iGEM become clear to us. This conference was really a “cheer-up” for us as both host and also for all the attendees. It gave us inspirations on changing perspective in our work both inside and outside the lab.

Aalto-Helsinki,2016,Team:Aalto-Helsinki#Achievements_-_-_TEXT.html," sequence. Although this is a small difference, it could nevertheless potentially prevent the transporter from functioning entirely as intended. If experiments could be continued, the other transporter constructs should be tested. In addition, more experiment replicates would be needed to prove or disprove transporter functionality; as our visual catalase assay is rather imprecise, replicates for it would be needed to confirm results.
Transporter functionality is essential for our sensor concept as without it, the toxin can not be imported into the cell and thus it cannot cause any response in promoters. For this reason, solving the transporter problems would be of prime importance. One possible idea to be considered is the transformation of the stress promoters into VL3 strain as it already has the transporter for microcystin. However, it is difficult to assess and predict the feasibility and potential problems arising with this, as VL3 is not typically used in lab work.
Two of our stress promoter constructs (TSA1 and CCP1) seemed to be functional when their behaviour was tested with hydrogen peroxide. The base level of TSA1 fluorescence was rather high, and relative changes were rather small. Still, it clearly seemed to be upregulated by oxidative stress. For the CCP1 promoter, construct base level was near to zero, absolute values of induced fluorescence were much smaller, but relative values were significantly greater.
Even though there is a good proof of concept that both promoters are induced by oxidative stress using hydrogen peroxide, we don’t have data on their behavior when the oxidative stress is induced by microcystin. Hydrogen peroxide is a reactive oxygen species, and microcystin raises cellular reactive oxygen species levels, so we estimated that they affect the oxidative stress related genes in the same way. Nevertheless, this assumption would ultimately need to be proven by experimental results. We hoped to be able to test this during our project, but unfortunately we couldn’t get the QDR2 transporter from VL3 integrated into lab strain’s genome so that it would have remained functional. Without the transporter, microcystin induction of our promoters isn’t possible.
If the promoter constructs could be proven to work similarly with microcystin induction as with hydrogen peroxide induction, they would require additional optimization to facilitate the interpretation of the fluorescence. The main focus would be on producing a more easily quantifiable visual signal. The CCP1 promoter would seem to be the best option for optimization, as although its expression level is low, the fluorescent signal could be amplified using e.g. a genetic amplification circuit. However, this would require much optimization to achieve stable and comparable signals. Genomic integration of the synthetic constructs"

Abstract
More than 300 million people suffer from depression and anxiety worldwide. Although there are many therapeutic strategies available, novel treatments targeting the gut-brain axis are currently gaining importance. This is mainly because of the strong relationship that exists between alterations in the gut microbiome, systemic inflammation, and psychiatric disorders. Here, we propose the development of Lactobachill, a smart psychobiotic that in addition to its intrinsic probiotic properties, can also aid in the normalization of aberrant gut-brain signaling. For this, we will develop two different strategies aimed at blocking the trans-signaling pathway of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-6. Increased levels of this pleiotropic cytokine have been implicated in the pathophysiology and treatment of clinical depression, which in turn is accompanied by an increase in the levels of oxidative and nitrosative stress. Lactobachill is based on the widely used probiotic strain, Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, a biosensing component that detects an increase in nitrosative stress, and two different response mechanisms: 1) secretion of the soluble variant of sgp130, the soluble form of the IL-6 signal transducer; and 2) secretion of a mutated variant of sIL-6R that cannot bind to gp130. This smart psychobiotic will be able to sense and respond to alterations in inflammatory and nitrosative stress pathways, which are critical to the pathogenesis of depression. Non-conventional therapies, including psychobiotics such as Lactobachill, could be used as adjuvants to increase the efficacy of existing treatments against these and other mental disorders.

WLC-Milwaukee,2015,Team:WLC-Milwaukee#Project_-_-_TEXT.html,". These antibiotics inhibit the enzymes required to produce tetrahydrofolic acid which is necessary for the reactions that result in the formation of nucleic acids and fMet. Mammals do not synthesize tetrahydrofolic acid which decreases the risk of unwanted side effects in their application. These antibiotics are generally only bacteriostatic because synthesis of new amino acids is not absolutely necessary.[1]
This is not an exhaustive list, but merely an overview of the main groups of antibiotics. There is a need for new antibiotics, both discovered in nature and synthesized in the lab, to effectively combat infectious bacteria which continue to evolve mechanisms of defense.
https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/08/Antibiotics_Mechanisms_of_action.png
Modes of resistance:
Bacteria have evolved methods to be resistant to various antibiotics. Resistance differs from tolerance in that it causes the bacterium to stop growing while the concentrations of antibiotic are high, it does not require mutations or additional genes, and it is reversible. A resistant bacterium will grow even in the presence of antibiotic, gained resistance from mutation or from a resistance gene, and is not reversible.[1]
Mechanisms of antibiotic resistance tend to fall into one of four general areas: preventing the antibiotic from reaching its target (often by efflux), chemically modifying the antibiotic so it becomes harmless, modifying the antibiotic’s target so it is unaffected by the antibiotic, or preventing the antibiotic from becoming activated.[1]
There are several ways that bacteria prevent an antibiotic from reaching its target and taking effect. Merely the structure of the cell membrane, particularly in gram-negative cells forms the first line of defense. Antibiotics must pass through the outer membrane and the inner membrane to reach the cytoplasm. There are outer membrane porins which allow for transport of some molecules, but they selectively permit certain molecules based on size. Large, bulky molecules are unable to enter the cell through these porins. However mutations in the genes for the porin proteins can act either to broaden or narrow the opening of these porins thus changing the selection of which molecules can enter the cell. Antibiotics may also be prevented from crossing the cytoplasmic membrane. A more common resistance mechanism is the active efflux pump. Efflux pumps are ubiquitous in bacteria and work to prevent the accumulation of an antibiotic in the cell so that it never reaches an inhibitory concentration. These pumps may be specific or compatible with many substrates and are found in both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. Efflux pumps have been reported for every group of antibiotic, causing a significant challenge in combating bacterial infection.["

Peking
We met team Peking first on the 5th Conference of China iGEMer Community (CCiC). After intense and deep discussions on our project design, team Peking proposed that it is necessary to consider the kinetics properties of dCas9 protein and sgRNA-dCas9 complex, especially in multi-sgRNA systems. Besides, we realized that dCas9 proteins would be saturated by a certain sgRNA with its high concentration, which would disrupt the entire multi-sgRNA system. To solve these problems, team Peking provided us a prototype based on dCas9 activator and binding period delay causing by RNAi which will help us improve and perfect our project modeling in the future.

This qualitative failure is characterized by liquid leaking out of a channel and/or primitive into the space between the PDMS and flow layer. An initial leak occurs almost immediately after a liquid passes the area of the leak. Regardless of scale, these leaks are considered a failure mode.
Leak (Over Time)
This qualitative failure is characterized by liquid leaking out of a channel and/or primitive into the space between the PDMS and flow layer. A leak that occurs over time is not characterized by an initial leak growing over time but as a leak that appears a significant amount of time after liquid has passed the location of a leak. These leaks can be seen in situations where a seal degrades during incubation period, leading to a new leak forming minutes after liquid initially passed through a section. Regardless of scale, these leaks are considered a failure mode.
An initial leak. The red liquid has leaked out of the channel into the area between the PDMS and the flow layer.
Air Bubble
This qualitative failure is characterized by an air bubble being present within a channel or primitive. Air bubbles can affect proper liquid flow and can reduce the accuracy of design features such as time-dependent mixers and metering. Regardless of scale, air bubbles are considered a failure mode.
Multiple air bubbles are present in this chip. The red and blue liquids should extend down and up respectively to the circle valve between them, however air bubbles are present that are preventing these liquids from completely filling their respective channels.
Liquid does not cross an OPEN Valve
This qualitative failure is characterized by liquid not crossing over a valve that has been opened by actuating the corresponding syringe on the control layer. This failure can exist in many forms, such as liquid pausing after filling the first portion of the valve and never crossing into the second section or leakage around the first portion of a valve. This failure is often accompanied by leakage due to pressure buildup.
Liquid is not properly crossing over a valve in this chip. After filling the first portion of the valve the red liquid should be crossing into the other section and filling the following channels. However, it is not crossing, which can cause leaks and improper liquid flow.
Liquid crosses a CLOSED Valve
This qualitative failure is characterized by a liquid crossing over a valve that is closed, meaning that it’s corresponding control syringe has not been actuated. This failure can exist in many forms, such as liquid leaking over a valve that has never been opened before or leaking over a valve that was previously opened by is not closed. This failure can lead to contamination of liquids as well as inaccuracies with features such as metering.

NRP-UEA-Norwich,2012,Team:NRP-UEA-Norwich#NOSensing_-_-_TEXT.html," regulated by nitrates and nitrites; and NsrR, which is regulated by nitric oxide (Figure 1.). One of the key elements of PyeaR is that it is not repressed in aerobic conditions, allowing for easier carrying out of experiments. The PyeaR aspect of the hybrid promoter has been known throughout the project as the bacterial promoter, or simply B.
The mammalian element of the hybrid promoter was produced by nine CArG elements (repeated elements of CC(A/T)(6)GG), a promoter previously used synthetically for nitric oxide synthase as a cancer therapy (Worthington et al., 2005) and developed from the EGR1 gene for early growth response protein 1 (Scott et al., 2002). The CArG aspect of the hybrid promoter has been known throughout the project as the mammalian promoter, or simply M.
Following identification of the two elements of the hybrid promoters the B (PyeaR) and M (CArG) aspects were ligated to one another in two orientations; B upstream of M (B-M) and M upstream of M (M-B) (Figure 2.). The hybrid promoters were synthesised in a pUC57 backbone with the standard iGEM restriction sites of EcoR1/Xba1 upstream of the promoter, and Spe1/Pst1 downstream of the promoter. A BamH1 restriction site was included in between the B and M sequences in order to allow for the B and M elements to be separated, as well as for easy verification of the promoter having been ligated into the iGEM backbone in future experiments (as BamH1 does not already exist in the pSB1C3 backbone).
Characterisation of Existing BioBrick: BBa_K381001 (PyeaR + GFP BioBrick)
In order to begin to develop experiments to characterise the hybrid promoters + fluorescent proteins experiments were also carried out on a BioBrick containing PyeaR + GFP (Part BBa_K381001 , Bristol 2010). In these experiments transformed E. coli was inoculated into liquid culture, which in turn had varying potassium nitrate concentrations added to it. They were then left to grow before being spun down and viewed under a UV box in order to observe. The different concentrations of potassium nitrate that the transformed E. coli was grown in were: 0 mM, 1 mM, 2 mM, 3 mM, 4 mM, 5 mM, 6 mM, 8 mM, 10 mM.

Fatty Acid Sensing Mechanism
Overview
In 2009, Prof. James Liao's research group at UCLA published their findings that mice expressing synthetic glyoxylate shunt had increased resistance to diet-induced obesity. To engineer this behavior in mice, they introduced glyoxylate shunt genes to mouse liver cells, employing a constitutive promoter for expression of the said genes.   Though not demonstrated in mice, we worry that this glyoxylate shunt, when constantly turned on in human cells, could incur a fitness cost by continuing to burn off energy when the environment is not so energy rich. Thus, we are working to put this glyoxylate shunt under regulation by an inducible system, which would allow tunable fatty acid uptake by sensing fatty acid concentrations. Such a system should reduce the risk of energy or fatty acid deficiency when the surrounding fatty acid concentration is not too high.  To construct this inducible system, we searched for candidates that could regulate gene expression on the level of transcription while responding to fatty acid levels. Four different fatty acid induced promoters were then investigated, namely:
1. Liver Fatty Acid Binding Protein 1 (FABP1) Promoter;
2. Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor-alpha (PPAR-alpha) Promoter;
3. Glucose Regulated Protein (GRP78) Promoter; and
4. Fatty Acid Metabolism Regulator Protein (FadR) and FadBA Promoter.

Quorum Sensing
To design living cells that display this behavior we will use the natural ability found in cells to communicate their presence to cells in their proximity and likewise sense the presence of other cells by means of quorum sensing mechanisms. Quorum sensing is used by bacteria to coordinate behaviors based on the density of their population. Bacteria that are capable of quorum sensing constantly produce certain signal molecules called autoinducers. Based on the concentration of these signal molecules bacteria respond, and regulate a number of different processes. Quorum sensing can occur within a single bacterial species, as well as between different species. An example of quorum sensing regulated bacterial behavior is the formation of biofilm [7]
B.L. Bassler. Small Talk: cell-to-cell communiction in bacteria. Cell, 109, 2002.
. Another example is the production of signal molecule by Vibrio fischeri to adjust the production of luciferase, a light emitting protein, by cells present in close proximity. There are different types of quorum sensing systems which have their own signal molecules. One class of signal molecules is that of the acyl-homoserine lactone autoinducers. This class of signal molecules is used by different species of bacteria like V. fischeri, and P. aeruginosa. Each species uses a slightly different acyl-HSL, and there is a strong homology in the proteins involved in the quorum sensing systems of acyl-homoserine lactone producing bacteria. For instance TraR in A. tumefaciens, LasR in P. aeruginosa an LuxR in V. fischeri.
The acyl-HCL system was first described in V. fischeri [8]
C.H. Collins, F.H. Arnold, and J.R. Leadbetter. Directed evolution of Vibrio fischeri LuxR for increased sensitivity to a broad spectrum of acyl-homoserine lactones. Molecular Microbiology, 55, 2005.
. The acyl-HSL of V. fischeri is 3-hexanoyl homoserine lactone (3OC6-HSL)2. 3OC6-HSL is synthesized by the LuxI protein. 3OC6-HSL binds to the transcription regulator LuxR and dimeric LuxR with bound 3OC6-HSL then binds to DNA and activates transcription of the Lux"

BioBricks made by iGEM Stockholm 2016
On this page, we compiled an overview of all the BioBricks we have created this summer in our mission to degrade biofilms. The links below will lead you the corresponding registry entry, if you'd like to to know more about the proteins, have a look at our project description or our results page .
Composite Parts
The composite parts in our project were all assembled in a similar fashion, creating two new BioBricks for each protein. The first construct was generally a simple assembly with a T7 promoter allowing for inducible protein expression. The second BioBrick contained an additional sequence consisting or a linker and two tags (LT) - one needed for purification and one for Sortase-A-mediated conjugation of our proteins to spider silk.
BBa_K2144000 T7-Nuclease
BBa_K2144011 T7-Nuclease-LT
Nuc2, isolated form S. epidermidis is a well-known nuclease that we assembled with a T7 promoter in order to degrade biofilm-associated extracellular DNA.
BBa_K2144001 T7-Lysostaphin
BBa_K2144005 T7-Lysostaphin-LT
Lysostaphin displays a highly specific endopeptidase activity which has been shown to degrade a key components of many biofilms as well as peptidoglycans found in cell walls.
BBa_K2144010 T7-Esp
BBa_K2144012 T7-Esp-LT
Esp is a serine protease secreted by S. epidermidis which degrades a variety of proteins associated with cell walls or the biofilm itself, among them many virulence factors.
BBa_K2144003 T7-Defensin
BBa_K2144007 T7-Defensin-LT
Defensins are a class of molecules known to disrupt membrane integrity of pathogenic organisms, dramatically increasing membrane permeability and leading to cell death.

CLSB-UK,2017,Team:CLSB-UK#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html,"as cited by doctors), and had 2 well characterized miRNA biomarkers. However, due to the programmable nature of toehold switches, our concept could be applied any miRNA sequence.
Using multiple switches that regulate the production of reporter proteins with distinct emission peaks, with numerous wells in tandem, hundreds of cancers and other diseases could be screened for simultaneously, all using a single blood sample.
We interviewed several doctors to gain further insight into how our design could be optimized for clincial use. These feature on our integrated human practices page .
Other methods of quantifying miRNAs
To further consider the applications of our project, we also looked at current methods of quantifying miRNAs in qPCR and microarrays. We saw that both had their limitations, and a novel method was required if miRNAs were to be used clinically as a biomarker for cancer.
qPCR
qPCR is an accurate and sensitive method of quantifying miRNAs. To provide a common sequence feature for amplification of miRNAs, a polyadenylation step is required. This adds an oligonucleotide tail to the end of the miRNA to which the primer binds to. After this, a reverse transcription transcription step is carried out to produce cDNA. Standard qPCR can then be used. [15]
This multi-step process is labour-intensive and as such, it is not suitable for scaling and would therefore be unsuitable for mass screening. Additionally, the enzymes and reagents are costly when attempting to quantify numerous different miRNAs.
Microarrays
It can be challenging to develop probes and hybridization conditions that work well to detect numerous miRNAs at once. Consequently, microarrays typically have issues with cross-hybridization [16] leading to false positives. Furthermore, results are inconsistent even from the same platform. [17]
We also spoke to Dan Pregibon, an expert who developed a new way of detecting miRNAs. He was intrigued by our idea to use toehold switches to sense these miRNAs. He said that our method could be used in less developed countries and to provide point of care information, in a way his would not. However, he explained that while his sensor has undergone significant testing, it is not ready for clinical use until miRNAs have been more robustly characterized. The same would apply to our sensor, however, research into miRNA diagnostics is very promising. It is likely to only be a matter of time until miRNAs have been sufficiently characterized to be used in clinical diagnosis.
Applications to other disease
There many other diseases where screening has the potential"

AhpCp
We successfully improved the biobrick part: ahpC promoter ahpC (K362001) . Originally created by the KIT-Kyoto 2010 iGEM team by taking the upstream 1000bp of the AhpC gene, we improved the promoter by first mutating the PstI cutting site to make it conform to Assembly standard 10. We then designed specific primers to cut short the original sequence of AhpCp promoter to trim out unneeded sequences make it more efficient. More details about the design can be found on the Nosema Sensor page.

Experiments described in our wiki were carried out by members of the iGEM team Bielefeld-CeBiTec 2017 (see members page for details). Some very specific analyses were supported by other scientists from Bielefeld University, but executed by team members. In very few cases, we used commercial services for routine tasks like DNA synthesis, oligonucleotide synthesis or Sanger sequencing of parts (Sequencing Core Facility, CeBiTec, Bielefeld, Germany).
We would like to thank everyone who supported our project. An ambitious project like this would have been hard to complete without support from all over the world. During our research, every member of our team gained unique skills and knowledge from several experts listed below. Their expertise helped us to generate a sophisticated toolbox and to demonstrate its functionality.
General Support
Prof. Dr. Jörn Kalinowski (1stPI) gave us the opportunity to participate in iGEM by providing us with our own laboratory and the resources of his group.
Dr. Christian Rückert (2ndPI) participated in our weekly team meetings and helped us with advice and assistance.

IISc_Bangalore,2016,Team:IISc Bangalore#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," As scientists and engineers, it seems obvious that our contribution can be most easily and effectively be made at the level of manufacturing costs; to try to bring down the cost of these life-saving products.

Bioreactor design
We realized that manufacturing units use expensive and energy expensive machinery [3] . Hence, we engineered our bacteria in such a way that it could do most of the work done by these monstrous machines so that we no longer have to buy them and pay their bills. To increase the yield of the product, we came up with the idea of separating cell growth and target protein production so that when the cells have grown up to a high enough cell density, they shuttle all their energy towards the required protein production [4] . Based on the above ideas, we came up with the design of our bioreactor.
We realized that we would not be able to work on the whole idea this summer so, we focussed on two modules of our design: the Protein production module and the auto-aggregation module leaving the arresting of cell growth for future iGEM teams as a seed for their ideas.
×
Protein production
Induction synthesis of protein of interest is another important step. Microorganisms in bioreactors are induced at the OD, at which the protein production is maximum. [5] Because of this, factories install sophisticated machinery to keep track of the OD value of the culture so as to know when to induce the production. We wanted our bacteria to know when to start protein production and start it by itself. Hence, we used the lux quorum sensing system to sense this cell density. [6] We have expressed the gene for our protein of interest under the luxI gene so that protein of interest is produced in significant quantities only when the quorum is achieved.(Figure 2) We also wish to tune the quorum sensing system by tweaking with the strength of the promoters involved in quorum sensing.
×
Auto-aggregation
To achieve cellular aggregation, we use the famous auto-transporter protein, Antigen43 (Ag43). [7] It has shown to cause auto-aggregation of cells when overexpressed. (Figure 3) We plan to exploit this property of Ag43 to substitute centrifugation. We acknowledge previous iGEM teams who have worked on Ag43 (Hokkaido University, 2012; Aberdeen Scotland, 2014 and some more) as we got the BioBricks for Ag43 readily available.  We intend to express Ag43 only when the cells have made the product of interest. Hence, we use the diauxic"

Project
To promote public awareness of synthetic biology and introduce its basic ideas to the laymen, our team devoted to the development of an experimental video game which aims at instructing non-biologists to design and improve biological systems. Following the games-with-a-purpose paradigm in which players help solve scientific problems, we attempt to apply the human brain's puzzle-solving abilities to the complex designs of biological systems. While most of developed simulation tools are designed for experts to model the reaction networks from scratch, our game integrates a modeling environment in which users only need to submit their assembling of parts for our program to discover and generate the biological model automatically.

Decision to arrange a summer school for pupils in their last year before the final exams
Discussion about how to meet a member of the german Bundestag (the german parliament)
Monday April 30th
Team Student Academy:
We got the chance to organize one part of the first school academy “synthetic biology/ biotechnology” at the CeBiTec of University Bielefeld by arranging experiments for the pupils and by presenting us and the iGEM competition. For the experimental part our general idea was to give them an understanding of principle methods in biotechnology / synthetic biology by using fluorescent proteins. We planned the following experiments:
Plasmid isolation of RFP/GFP from a liquid culture.
Transformation of a plasmid mixture consisting of two different fluorescent proteins (e.g. RFP and GFP) and different antibiotic resistances into E. coli KRX. It will be plated out on LB agar plates without antibiotics and on plates containing one of the two antibiotics, which are present on the plasmids. This way we can demonstrate the effect of antibiotics as selective pressure.
Team Cloning of Bacterial Laccases:
Before our lab time started we sent requests for different plasmids with the desired laccase genes to working groups, which have already worked with laccases we are interested in. Sadly just one working group responded to us. We got answer for a vector with the laccase-ORF CotA from Bacillus pumilus ATCC7061 and an ampicillin resistance from the Swiss Federal Laboratories for Materials Science and Technology, Laboratory for Biomaterials in Switzerland. They promised to send us the plasmid pBpL6. More information... For an uniformly labeling we will further call this laccase BPUL.
In a publication we found a research group who worked with the laccase CopA from Xanthomonas pv. campestris ATCC33913. Luckily the sequence of this laccase is the same in Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris B100 which we got from a research group at our university. We will call this laccase XCCL in our wiki from now on.
We found a publication which described the laccase CueO from E. coli W3110. After blasting this laccase we found out that E. coli BL21(DE3) has this laccase, too. We decided to isolate the laccase from E. coli BL21(DE3) because this strain is available in our lab.

Project Background
In fields such as nano-scale robotics and manufacturing, researchers have encountered problems in generating motion and force reliably. In recent years many attempts have been made at using microorganisms to create usable mechanical force. Since microorganisms have adapted ways of efficiently creating movement in nanoscale environments, they pose an interesting alternative to conventional mechanical devices as means of driving nanoscale machines, much in the same way that animals have been used in agriculture and production in the past. Different approaches have been taken including using swimming bacteria to drive microgears [ 1 ], move objects [ 2 ] and to generate organised flow on surfaces and in pump-like systems [ 3 ],[ 4 ]. Different attempts at introducing remote control in such systems have also been made using magnetism [ 5 ], chemical stimuli [ 4 ] and light [ 6 ]. It seems obvious how synthetic biology might contribute by creating systems for these purposes.
The Idea
Inspired by an article on flow generated in a micro-capillary tube by a bacterial ""pump"" [ 4 ], we have decided to attempt construction of a similar system. In the article a pump was constructed by coating the inside of a tube with Serratia marcesens. This was done by washing a bacterial suspension through the tube at a speed, that allowed the cells to adhere to the surface. The flow also had the effect of aligning most of the bacteria so their flagella were facing downstream. When the induction of flow was stopped, the bacteria kept the solution flowing with their flagella, in essence acting as a pump. Control was achieved by altering the glucose concentration of the buffer solution. They were able to show a measurable force for several hours, before the cells suffered from nutrient deficiency (or high waste production) and died.
Figure 1: Illustration of the over-all flow system
Our Approach
Our approach focuses on E. coli strain MG1655 that will be modified to overexpress flagella, in an attempt to increase the force generation potential. We also want to be able to regulate the flow that is generated"

Conference
This year, besides Eurasian Meetup, our team has participated other two conferences: CCiC in Shanghai and Bluepha Conference in Shenzhen.
CCiC
From September 28th to 31st, we participated in the fifth CCiC held in Shanghai, China. It was a great experience for us to share and learn with dozens of other Chinese IGEM teams. We recieved many helpful feedback of our prototype shown in our presentation, which helps us to refine the performance and safety of our final product.
Bluepha Conference
Basic information
Date: 2018.6.24
Address: Qinghua Information Port, Shenzhen Guangdong
Number of teams attending the conference: 6
In this conference, we firstly presented the whole idea about our experimental design and concluded all the investigation we did until then. Nevertheless, although the principle was already clear, we had no concept about our product design, which means that we did not consider how to maintain the efficiency to process formaldehyde, ensure that the E.coli is safe to human, and dispose the dead E.coli without polluting the environment. Under the help of tutor from Bluepha, we got several useful suggestions. First, it is necessary to design an experiment test the efficiency of our product as well as how long it works. Second, to consider how to design the container of our product to separate E.coli from users is better than to consider if the product is safe enough to touch.

Tsinghua,2018,Team:Tsinghua#Demonstrate_-_-_TEXT.html," the new lux pR-HS ( BBa_K2558001 ) we designed had lower basal expression. The addition of Safety Catch ( BBa_K2558215 ) and Safety Catch-HS ( BBa_K2558216 )  almost eliminated the leakage of both positive feedback and the non-positive feedback systems. It is foreseeable that with appropriate parameters NEON system can be activated to almost 104 fold.

The fluorescence intensity was measured by flow cytometer at 488 nm. Neon, Safety Catch, Safety Catch-HS and lux pR, lux pR-HS test plasmids were transferred into E.coli DH5α. High fluorescence intensity suggests high level of basal expression in the system.
>>>>Protocol
1. Transform the plasmids into E. coli DH5α.
2. Pick a single colony by a sterile tip from each of the LB plates for all the experimental and control groups. Add the colony into 5ml LB medium with ampicillin at 100 ng/µl and chloramphenicol at 34 ng/µl. Incubate for 6-8 h at 37℃ in a shaker.
3. Measure OD600 of the culture medium with photometer. Dilute the culture medium until OD600 reaches 0.6.
4. Add 100 µl bacteria culture medium into a sterile 96-well plate. Add IPTG to final concentrations of 0 or 10 mM and AHL to final concentrations of 0, 10-9, 10-8 M. Fresh LB medium serves as blank control. Fix sample with 1.5 mg/ml kanamycin at one hour intervals. Then use flow cytometry to measure the fluorescent intensity at 488 nm of each sample.
5. Each group should be repeated for at least 3 times.

Just using painting brushes to dip in the culture medium containing these strains and draw on the solid medium, after culturing in 37℃ over night, we could finally get these beautiful works.We held a little painting competition in our school and attracted over 40 students to participate. Then, we decided to hold this activity in the science museum again to provide the opportunity for kids to learn some basic knowledge of synthetic biology when they were totally involved in this unusual painting competition.Of course,we requested every participant to wear gloves when they were painting. The following pictures showed these kids who did really love this activity.
What’s more, we met some professionals on site occasionally, who also showed interest in our work, so we seized the opportunity to discuss with them.
Way to a new world
If this activity is a key to the syn-bio door, then we stepped on to guide who interested in it to go a little further. You may already noticed that all the stamps and souvenirs were related to iGEM. The motifs on the stamps consist of the logo of iGEM, ZJU team logos from 2013 to 2017, and high school’s team logo this year. What’s more, when a children happily went home with a notebook designed by our own, he would find a brief summary of our project on the first page. For more syn-bio information, people can scan the QR code on the back of notebooks to book our wechat subscription. In this way, we can let more people know about iGEM and keep the communication with public.
We not only held some public involved activities, but also took part in some meetings to communicate with other participants.

Overview
Models
Simulations
Genome Deletion
Based on the genetic circuit , we know that
The lambda cI promoter is repressed by the protein cI that is produced constitutively under the strong promoter J23114.
At 28°C, functional protein cI will bind to the lambda cI promoter to repress it. Restriction enzymes DpnII and TaqI will not be produced.
When there is an increase in temperature (from 28°C to 42°C
[1 ]
[2 ]
), there will be a de-repression of lambda cI promoter, causing restriction enzymes DpnII and TaqI to be produced.

Our goals
We aim to:
Illustrate how temperature correlates to restriction enzyme concentration, and see how it affects the population of live cells, so as to characterise the effects of temperature on cell death.
Develop a model of the number of live and dead cells. From this, we can monitor the rate of killing and perform data analysis.
  about the model assumptions and predictions!
The system
The system is made up of 6 ODEs based on the Module 3: Genome deletion genetic circuit. ODEs are also used in modelling the population of E. coli.
  about the equations and what they mean!
Summary of Simulation results
Temperature above threshold – Cell population goes to zero
If the temperatures are above threshold, the population growth of live cells will be constrained by the concentration of restriction enzyme.
The maximum live cell population at a given temperature will also be lower for higher temperatures
If the lambda cI promoter is strong, there will be a higher rate of cell death than cell growth; we will see a decrease in live cell population. However, if lambda cI promoter is weak, there might not be enough killing, so we will only see a reduction in growth of cell population, ie: a slower increase in population.
  about the simulations!
Conclusions
A decrease in live cell population means that cell death is greater than cell growth, due to the killing by restriction enzyme. This is when M3 has fully kicked in.
At the threshold temperature, cell death balances cell reproduction, and we would notice a straight line in the live cell curve. Above this temperature, cell death dominates, and a decrease in cell population"
TU_Munich,2012,Team:TU Munich#Project#Thaumatin_-_-_TEXT.html,"pro-Thaumatin ( BBa_K801080 ) that is believed to be exported on its own [ Edens et al., 1984 ]. The original gene sequence was optimized for best yeast codon usage using  GeneArt® GeneOptimizer®. We ordered the gene synthesis and cloned this BioBrick into pSB1C3 and our galactose inducible yeast expression vector pTUM104. Furthermore we constructed an expression cassette with TeF1-promoter and the TeF1-terminator, which is also available as a protein generator (BBa_K801081). This expression cassette was subsequently cloned into the integration vector (BBa_K300001 ) assuring expression in brewing medium.
Expression of Thaumatin
We are planning a western blot of the supernatant to prove proper secretion. SDS page and coomassie/silver staining have proven to be too insensitive.
Ion exchange chromatography
Preprothaumatin will be posttranslationally modified by cleaving a part of the N- and the C-terminal polypeptide. Therefore it was not possible to add a tag for affinity chromatography. For this reason it was necessary to purify the protein from the cytoplasm of the disintegrated yeast cells using ion exchange chromatography for having a proof of principle.
Experimental details:
Samples: cell lysate, supernatant from culture, reference for thaumatin (MedHerbs)
Dialysis against 20 mM MES buffer pH 6.0 (twice) using a 12-16 kDa dialysis membrane
Chromatography with a Äkta purifier equipped with a Ressource S 6ml (S: Methyl sulfonate (strong cation exchanger))
Sample was applied using a super-loop
Wash with two column volumes 20 mM MES buffer pH 6.0
Elution with a gradient of 0-500 mM NaCl over 5 column volumes
Fractions of 1 ml were collected during the elution
Experimental results:
Reference thaumatin (see figure A and B)
nearly no protein in the flow through during sample application (see figure A)
a major peak eluting at ~14 mS*cm-1 which corresponds to fraction No. 14, see figure A)
the corresponding SDS-PAGE showed a clear bond around fraction No. 14 corresponding the expected 22 kDa
Cell lysate
high concentration of protein in the flow through (see figure C and D)
no clear peak around fraction No. 14 could be detected

We help USTC Wet Team identify the kinetic parameters in pConX2+LuxR+pLux/Tet+GFP device. The completion of this model are a result of collaboration. With the permission from both teams, we share the source code of this description page together
pConX2+LuxR+pLux/Tet+GFP
Parts:
Reactions and ODE
A Simplified Model
We employed an ODE model. We defined the input to be AHLout the and the output to be the synthesis rate of mature GFP. In this system,we assumed the concentration of the LuxR was constant.
To simplify the model, the (Recation S2-4), (Recation S2-5) and (Recation S2-6) were considered to be able to get balance in a very short time.
From above equations, we can the change of PoPS respond to the AHLin.
For this system, the value of parameter d, 0.00847, could be estimated based on the measurement of the OD. For instance, when the concentration of AHLout was zero, the value of d was 0.00368 per minute. The values of 4.8E-3 per sec for rmG, 1.8E-3 per sec for a and 0.4 per sec for pG were got from the experiment conducted by Barry Canton and Anna Labno in 2004, click here to the details.
Identification Results
With the help of USTC Wet Team , we succeeded to estimate the values of k3, rAHLin, C1, C2, C3 and C4. The simulation results as follows.
Parameters
k3=0.8; rAHL=0.001; C1=1.5*10^(-10); C2=1*10^(10); C3=8*10^(-7); C4=5.8*10^(11)

Fudan-CHINA,2018,Team:Fudan-CHINA#Composite Part_-_-_TEXT.html," the original ECFP shows a 5.7 folds of intensity compared to original ECFP (BBa_E0020), exceeding the less than 10-fold result reported in literature.
We carry out this experiment with E. coli. Firstly, we transfect E. coli BL21 with plasmids carrying BBa_K2886013 and BBa_K2886012 respectively. Then, when they express enough cECFP and nECFP, we lyse the bacteria with ultrasound and mix them up to emit cECFP and nECFP to a same system. At last, we measure the fluorescence with plate reader compared with negative and positive controls. Figure 1 shows that our attempt does succeed and even is better than the result reported in literature, which make it more reliable for more complicated conditions.
To further demonstrate the reliability of our BiFC system, we also do some similar things in Hela cells. We add outer-membrane and transmembrane domain to it as well as substitute the leucine zipper with GS linker. The result suggests that our BiFC also works. For detailed information concerning this, please click here to visit our Receptor Demonstrate page.
Summary
To sum up, using BBa_K2886013 together with BBa_K2886012, we confirmed the reliability of the BiFC system we designed preliminarily, accumulating experiences and lying down bases for further experiments and demonstrations. If you want to test your own BiFC system in a convenient way, you may try this method to give you help.

NR1, BR1 and BR2 transformed cells and WT cells were stained with conjugated anti-FLAG antibodies according to the immunofluorescence staining protocol and viewed under a widefield fluorescence microscope (NR1) and a confocal microscope (BR1 and BR2) with the goal of imaging the expression of our GPCR chimeras and image their localization in the cell. The image was analyzed with ImageJ to compare the fluorescence of the cell and cell membrane to the overall fluorescence of the whole picture.
Outcome
It can be seen that there is expression of the receptor: +NR1 cells are fluorescent (figure 4 below) and the reference strain is very weakly fluorescent (figure 4 top). In some of the +NR1 cells there is clear halo structure visible, which indicates localization of the receptor on the membrane. Below such a typical halo is shown (figure 4). For +BR1 and +BR2 cells receptor expression can be shown also by the fluorescent signal (figure 5, other experiment). The location of the signal indicates expression unequally distributed over the cells, indicating that localization in the membrane is not fully functioning. Contrast of these pictures are not optimal. The reference strain (figure 5, top) showed very little fluorescence. Further, a small percentage of the cells (~5 %) was found to be fluorescent, indicating that constitutive mRNA expression by the GPD promoter did not lead to constitutive protein expression in all cells.

Figure 5: FLAG immunolocalization of +BR1 and +BR2  yeast cells expressing a receptor with FLAGtag.
Ligand activation
Setup
The next step was to test the binding of the ligand to our new introduced receptor. If the ligand binds correctly to the receptor the downstream pathway is activated and the cells should go in growth arrest. If cells are dividing the percentage of DNA is higher then for cells that are in growth"

Calgary,2009,Team:Calgary#23 July 2009_-_-_TEXT.html,"erver event basically is triggered when there is data being handled at different times, so it will check that the data being handled is a line of the notecard and if it is it will add the string of data to a temporary variable. Then it keeps track of the number of lines read in order to request the next line of the notecard, which requires the number. So now I am confident with the use of this script, which lessens my guilt for implementing it.
I was able to edit and add to notecards that Mandy will read when she has time, which include:
What is DNA?
What is RNA?
Translation
Restriction Digest
Ligation
I have also started a display for DNA replication for the base of the spiral when I take some time away from working on the virtual lab, which involves animating a lot of objects to represent the enzymes involved as well as all the pieces that will have to be rezzed to make a complementary strand of DNA. The difficulties I will encounter will probably be with having all objects moving at the right times and where they will have to travel.
I have discovered that my restriction digest activity does more that it has to, which is not a bad thing. So people can just play around if they want to ligate promoter and rbs together for practice or it could be walked through in the instructions. The notecard reader has been implemented in the third and final construction site and tomorrow after group meeting I would like to obtain the names of all the materials required so I can finish renaming the general materials for the activity.

Question 5
What do you think is the current situation of global climate?
你觉得目前全球气候的状况是怎样的？
We wanted to find Chinese people’ views on climate change. Results are that over a half people considered the situation of global warming was quite serious and almost half of people felt that climate was changing currently. Particularly, there was nobody thinking the climate as same as that many years ago. Therefore, we can know Chinese people still cared about climate and had similar view that climate was changing currently.
Question 6
Which of the following item do you think is the main cause of greenhouse effect?
你觉得什么是造成温室效应最大的原因?
We asked reasons for climate change, the majority of people thought we destoryed the environment and a few people considered it was the automatical processing on Earth development.
Question 7
Which behavior do you think will intensify the greenhouse effect?
你认为社会上哪些行为会加重温室效应？
Most of people industrial pollution is considered as the most serious issue on environmnet as well as the most significant reason for climate change. Also, people thought the reducing vegetation and the destruction of eco-environment caused global warming. They did not view the urbanization and garbage were the main reasons.
Question 8
Do you pay attention to reduce carbon dioxide emissions and promote low carbon life in your daily life?
你在日常生活中会注意减少自身二氧化碳排放，倡导低碳生活吗？
CO2 is a type of warming gases, its uncontrolled emissions may result in climate change. We wanted to remain people of reducing the emissions of CO2 in their daily life. We found that people would like to enjoy green lifestyle such as riding bicycle, but they need more guide lines.

Franconia,2017,Team:Franconia#Collaboration_-_-_TEXT.html," great time and learned many things about the carbon    footprint of the everyday lab work. Please visit the website of this beautiful project to learn     more about this initiative ! During our time in Dresden we found     many potential collaboration partners such as Cologne-Dusseldorf, Berlin and Potsdam.
After a short coffee break and the closing ceremony, where a photograph of all iGEM teams    has been taken, we made our departure from this beautiful city.
We would like to thank the iGEM Dresden team for organizing the whole meetup. We had     a great weekend and loads of fun getting to know the other teams and their projects!
European meetup
Delft
From the 6th to the 8th of July we were invited from the iGEM Team TU Delft to come    together at their university town. So four of our team members had the possibility to take part    at this year´s European Meet up. Amused by the mistake of the naked-camping- place we    booked an Airbnb in our neighboring country and set off by car at 5 AM on the 6th of July.    Tired of the long drive and walk we met several teams at an All You Can Eat in Delft in the    afternoon which was proposed by Team Delft. There we had the first chance to compare notes    with the others and look for some collaboration partners. Despite our tiredness we had much    fun and Leo enjoyed the free beer. Even on our first day in the Netherlands we found out that    there are more bicycles than people in this country. That is why you have to pay more    attention to bicyclists than to cars. The next day, after forgetting our poster and running back    to our Airbnb to take it, we all met at the university in Delft. Two biologists gave lectures on    iGEM topics and provided the basis for discussions. At lunch we met Team Freiburg. Or    rather Team Freiburg met us. They knew some of our team members from the German Meet    Up several days before and mentioned us, what we enjoyed very much.
After lunch time the    most interesting part began: the poster presentations. We realized next to the other posters our    was – although designed that way by choice – really minimalistic and simple but anyway we    did a great job and could get the others into our project. Altogether there were many    interesting projects presented and we’re excited to see them all in Boston when they’re    finished.

Is there a local biosafety group, committee, or review board at your institution? If yes, what does your local biosafety group think about your project?
Yes, there is a biological safety review board at Penn State University. The Institutional Biosafety Committee (IBC) records, reviews, and approves laboratory research based on the NIH Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant DNA Molecules. They have approved the research conducted in our lab, and we are in full compliance with the biosafety regulations imposed on our work by the IBC.
Do you have any other ideas how to deal with safety issues that could be useful for future iGEM competitions? How could parts, devices and systems be made even safer through biosafety engineering?
Another way to ensure safety could be to create a new lab strain of E.coli that has more auxotrophic requirements. This would make it more difficult for a modified bacteria to escape and possibly spread a Resistance factor or Virulence factor.
Parts could be made safer by introducing more regulation components. By making the bacteria require cofactors to function or to live in an antibiotic containing environment would help to ensure containment of the strain being studied. You could also make it more difficult for the new BioBricks to be transmitted in an active form to an undesired bacterial strain.
Collaboration
This year, the Penn State iGEM team completed a survey for the Macquarie Australia team, commenting on the open source nature of the iGEM competition wikis. We were able to provide detailed responses to questions about collaboration practices and open source material.
Attributions
Due to the foundational nature of this year's project objectives, the Penn State iGEM team used several BioBrick promoter pieces its constructs. Therefore, all the non-synthesized genetic material was obtained from the Salis and Richard labs at Penn State.
Using vectors from the Salis lab, both the multiple start codon and bidirectional promoter projects were assembled.
In addition to using plasmid vectors and equipment, the Salis lab provides a RBS Library Calculator software program to the public, which both forward- and reverse-engineers RBS sequences and translation initiation rates. This software was used heavily in the design of the multiple start codon project in synthesizing varying RBS lengths and strengths for the construct.
The codon optimization portion of the project was a side project of one of the Richard lab's graduate students, Michael Speer. His partially-assembled construct was the basis testing codon bias.

Week of May 29th
This was our first week in lab! We took a week off after school to take a break and destress. Since our team is relatively new to lab techniques and our parts haven’t come in yet, we decided to spend this first week working on basic lab techniques and the Interlab Study. We attempted to amplify the A3, C3, and K3 backbones while we waited for parts to arrive.
Week of June 4th
Our first week went well and we were happy with the way we completed the Interlab study. This week, we wanted to get started on our plastic project and assembled the HlyBD into an iGEM backbone for our PETase secretion system. Transformations and overnights for the HlyBD part were successful. We sent out our HlyBD part to be sequenced. We still had more difficulty with working on amplifying the iGEM backbones and decided to work on doing some troubleshooting to determine where our process is going wrong.
Week of June 11th
We got back our sequencing results and found out that we did correctly assemble our plasmid. We attempted to troubleshoot the amplification of iGEM backbones. Unfortunately, our G-blocks were delayed again so we weren’t able to do too much wet lab work. We started planning our Mid-Atlantic Meetup and other outreach activities for our local community.
Week of June 18th
Another week while our G-block wasn’t able to be synthesized. We really do need to get this PETase G-block so while IDT is still attempting to synthesize it for us, we are reaching out to other teams that have worked on it in the past to see if we could possible get it from them instead. We worked on cleaning the lab and ordering new reagents. We also learned theory for many different lab techniques so that we can instantly learn how to troubleshoot the problems that occur in lab.

Calgary,2009,Team:Calgary#News#Alberta Events_-_-_TEXT.html," Alberta teams. These events began with the Alberta Genetically Engineered Machines (AGEM) competition in September of 2008, an event to emulate the iGEM competition at MIT. Because of the enormous success of the event, AIF put forth a calendar of several events for the 2009 iGEM season. This began with the Dragon’s Den in Edmonton, followed by an Ethics Workshop in Calgary and the Presentation/Marketing/Wiki Workshop in Lethbridge. The AIF-organized Alberta events will culminate with the 2009 AGEM competition in the beautiful city of Banff this September. Please see below for more information on these events!
We are incredibly grateful for the support of AIF, especially the hard work done on the part of Jennifer Hill, Laura Gadowsky and Chris Dambrowitz in fostering our teams both financially and through the organization of Alberta-wide iGEM events.

Dragon's Den @ Edmonton, May 25th, 2009
THE DRAGONS WATCHING STUDENT PITCHES
On May 25th, 2009, the University of Calgary sent three stalwart comrades to brave the perils of Alberta Ingenuity’s Dragon’s Den. Brimming with talent, poise and sex appeal, our representatives had two goals in mind: (1) feed on the entrepreneurial power and advice of the infamous Dragons; and (2) come home with lots of money.
In the days leading to the event, we prepared a powerful power-point presentation that highlighted our project’s goals and the corresponding implementation plan. After heading up to Edmonton the night before, we rehearsed, rehearsed, rehearsed (and rehearsed a little more) so that we could best seduce the Dragons with our eloquent delivery. Because although we’re attractive, we don’t want to rely on that! Indeed, there’s nothing like gathering in a residence room well past midnight to remind us of our incredible last-minute undergraduate productivity.
We rose fresh the next morning, indulged in the culinary largesse of Aramark’s fine cuisine, and ventured downtown to finally face the ferocious Dragons. After witnessing formidable performances from the other Alberta teams, we sauntered up to the front and delivered our presentation. Immediately after the face-off, we incurred their wrath (read: received useful feedback) and were given suggestions on how to improve our marketing approach to potential investors.

Mid-Atlantic Meetup
On July 13th, we participated in the 2018 Mid-Atlantic Meetup hosted by the UMaryland iGEM team. It was a great experience of presenting and exchanging ideas with other iGEM teams, including UMaryland, William and Mary, Virginia, Georgia State and Richard Montgomery. We got good feedback from those teams, and their interest in our project and our presentation animations really motivated us. From listening to their presentations, we obtained some helpful tips in delivering a presentation. Moreover, thanks to this opportunity, we were able to meet the William and Mary team, which led to more discussion and the collaboration between us.
      
William and Mary
After realizing the advantages of 3G assembly developed by William and Mary, we were excited to test their procedure and prove the feasibility of their assembly method.
3G assembly uses Golden Gate and Gibson assembly to construct a variety of multi-part circuits. Compared to traditional DNA assembly methods, 3G is quicker and less expensive; circuits with multiple parts in it can be constructed in a day. More information on 3G assembly can be found here
After connecting with the William and Mary team at the Mid-Atlantic Meetup, we received a clearly written protocol and a 3G assembly kit with a very nice greeting. It was a very simple procedure, and by following the protocol, we were able to successfully assemble the parts using this method.
      
As seen in the Golden Gate gel extraction images, multiple parts were assembled together, forming transcriptional units of the correct length.

Experiment 2: Construction of 4 Circuits with 2 Transcriptional Units Each
We would like to thank the William and Mary team for sharing this assembly method with us!

Vilnius-Lithuania-OG,2018,Team:Vilnius-Lithuania-OG#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," the MDA reaction to take place. The substrate bound nucleotides are inaccessible to phi29 polymerase meaning that the reaction mix is missing 1 type of nucleotide triphosphates. For this reason the polymerase is unable to amplify DNA, therefore there no DNA product is detected (13 Fig., 3 well). However, the addition of purified catalytic biomolecule to the reaction mix and separate droplets catalyse the conversion of phi29 inaccessible substrate nucleotides to accessible ones and in turn enables the amplification reaction to occur (13 Fig., 4 well).  These results conclude, that MDA reaction compartmentalization in microliter droplets works as intended - substrate nucleotides are inaccessible to phi29 polymerase and catalytically converted one are accessible and thus can be incorporated into the DNA molecule.
Figure 14. Microscopic images of 10 pL, 40 pL and 50 pL emulsion.
After assessing the conditions for activity recording amplification, the next step was to optimise the droplet electrocoalescence step and prove that it enables the addition of amplification reagents to the biomolecule synthesis droplets without disrupting the compartmentalization of single DNA molecules and information, stored as concentration of catalytically converted substrate nucleotides in it.
Movie 2. Reinfusion of previously generated 10 pL into the microfluidic droplet electrocoalescence device. The rejected closely packed emulsion is spaced by continuous flow of fluorinated carrier oil flowing from the sides and meets newly generated MDA amplification droplets in the main device channel.
Droplet merging technique involves a delicate step: reinfusion of previously generated biomolecules synthesis droplets. We have successfully optimized the reinfusion methodology by trying out different ways to collect and reinfuse the emulsion. By collecting the 10pL droplets generated during previous library encapsulation steps into a piece of tubing and using it as a vessel to incubate droplets at 37oC we have successfully avoided any disruption of reinjected droplet integrity as shown by a video above ( Video 2). The reinjected emulsion is closely packed, is stable and contains no air bubbles in between leading to perfect droplet reinfusion.
The most important factors of droplet coalescence are voltage applied to the device electrodes, the flow rates of droplets and the volume ratio of droplets merged together. Any of these parameters could decrease the efficiency of droplet merging and thus affect the overall performance of whole method. Videos shown below display the consequences of bad droplet merging parameters"

Figure 5: Our interviews answers to what kind of impact the street science event had on their opinion on genetic engineering. The numbers inside the boxes show the total number of people who gave the respective answer. Nobody chose the third option, which was ""Yes, I now have a more negative opinion"". Only the answers of people who did not know about Synthetic Biology before the event are shown here.
Finally, we wanted to know whether our event had an impact on people's opinion on the topic of genetic engineering. Unfortunately, we were not able to do a before-and-after-survey, so we were only able to ask people after they had already talked to us. The results were satisfying: Of the people who had not heard of Synthetic Biology before the event, 60% said that they now had a more positive opinion on the subject (see Figure 5). Nobody answered that they had attained a more negative opinion after talking to us.
Conclusion
The purpose of Synbio Day was not only to educate children in a playful way but also to address their parents and adults in general. As you can see here, we tried to explain Synthetic Biology to adults of all ages and with various backgrounds to get as much feedback and public opinion as possible.
We were very happy with how the street science event turned out. We entertained and educated many children and were able to inform lots of adults about Synthetic Biology and our project and thus share our passion. In addition, the event was very educational for us as well. We were surprised to find that, at least after being informed about the project, people liked the idea of microbial fuel cells and many would even use them in their everyday lives. However, we also realized how important a thorough biosafety concept is for public acceptance, even when working with supposedly harmless BSL-1 organisms. Almost every adult we spoke to asked us about the risks of using GMOs and what would happen if the bacteria in the fuel cell were released into the environment. Most people were content when we explained what kind of biosafety approach we had planned, some still had doubts. This made us spend even more time on making the biosafety system work. We also learned to consider not only which safety-measures we as scientists deemed necessary, but what was required to achieve public acceptance.

In order to obtain accurate measurements one has to calibrate relative measurements via an absolute standard set of measurements and the lack of such an absolute standard for most of the commonly used reporters in synthetic biology causes variations in the evaluation of the product. To cater to the need to find a standard set of measurement for GFP we participated in the InterLab Measurement Study and shared our results with iGEM along with hundreds of other teams across the globe.
We used black 96 well plate and Synergy H1 microplate reader for our measurements and followed all the protocols provided by iGEM as precisely as possible; the results of which are given below,

Environmental escape not only is a risk that should be                             avoided out of public and environmental safety reasons, but also contributes to public fear                             of GMOs ( 1 ). We consulted several RIVM experts who confirmed that escape risk is a limiting                             factor in the advancement of GMO technologies. Environmental safety threats related to GMO                             escape includes the damaging of ecosystems, the risk of horizontal gene transfer and effects                             on biodiversity ( 2 ).
Gelcatraz has been designed with the intention of minimizing escape risk. We aim to provide a device which makes working with GMOs inside and outside of the laboratory more convenient                             and safer. Our adhesion system prevents bacterial leakers by securely anchoring E. coli to                             our device. Experimental results indicate that our adhesin decreases leakage by several                             orders of magnitude. Although leakage is low thanks to the adhesin, it is not yet zero. To                             minimize the consequences of a leakage event, we designed a kill switch for our E. coli.
Antibiotics reduction
Problem: The use of antibiotics in R&D  does not pose a major threat, but antibiotic resistance in general is an urgent problem requiring alternative solutions.
Experts: Prof. Van Hest, Plasmacure, PAMM, Maasstad Hospital, Cécile van der Vlugt (RIVM)
Solution: Secretion of bacteriocins as an alternative to antibiotics
More information
To research the problem of antibiotic resistance and the need for antibiotics reduction, we approached several                             experts. All of them highlighted the urgency of the problem. Plasmacure as well as the doctors in the Maasstad Hospital explained that S. aureus and P. aeruginosa are increasingly becoming resistant against                             commonly used antibiotics. This makes treatment more difficult and even puts patients’ lives at risk. We also                             learned that the use of systemic, unspecific antibiotics contributes to the development of antibiotic                             resistance, as described under Product Design .
To contribute to a solution for the treatment of antibiotic resistant infections, we designed our living                             material to secrete bacteriocins as an alternative to antibiotics. Details on their functioning can be found                             here. Immunity to lysostaphin has not been commonly observed, but it possible (11) .                             We aim to reduce this risk by integrating a quorum sensing system in the design. This way, the relevant                             bacteriocins will only be secreted in the presence of S. aureus and/or P. aeruginosa.

York_UK,2013,Team:York UK#Project.html_-_-_TEXT.html," Dry ice was left in the room to evaporate instead of disposing anywhere.
Microwave was used for melting agarose for agarose gels and LB agar for making LB agar plates. Thick gloves were used to take hot samples after heating.
Gel electrophoresis tanks were kept separately to avoid any electric shock.
All the unused isolated DNA was autoclaved in order to shear the genetic material that would not be used by bacteria in environment.
While using Bunsen burners no gloves were worn in order to prevent melting the gloves and causing high level of damage to the skin.
For adjusting the pH highly corrosive 1M NaOH was used. Thus gloves and protective glasses were worn in order to avoid any skin burning.
Phenol/Chloroform extraction of S. oneidensis genome was performed in the fume hood as both of the compounds are volatile and toxic.
β-mercaptoethanol was  used during the beta galactosidase activity assay. All the procedures performed in the fume hood to avoid intoxication of highly volatile compound.
As gold ions are toxic to most of the living organisms after each experiment we treated them with the excess of HEPES to form gold aggregates as well as washed with excess of water to dilute to non-toxic concentrations.

Laboratory Safety Guidelines
Laboratory Safety Form
Safety forms were approved on September 22, 2013 by Evan Appleton.
To minimise the risk one might be exposed to when working with Ethidium Bromide (which is a carcinogen) we used its safer alternative, SYBR Safe, for our gel electrophoresis.  Team members were protected from exposure to UV rays during gel reading with a UV shield. Facial shields were also available for use when needed.
Safety Concerns for Our Project:
There are no serious safety concerns, as the genes or their products that we work on have no identified risk to human health, do not influence the environment and are specific for only our project.
Do any of the new BioBrick parts (or devices) that you made this year raise any safety issues?
The only safety issue associated with our new BioBrick parts is researcher safety in testing the parts. We have documented our standard operating procedures above, which other teams can reference if they want to use our parts, or test other parts using arsenic or naphthalene.  We are also conducting extensive tests to assess the functionality of our BioBrick parts, to ensure that they behave as expected under different conditions.

1 Polymerase Chain Assembly
The primers corresponding to the new MaSp2 sequences with a valine added to the end came today. We conducted polymerase chain assembly to place the biobrick prefix/suffix and the BsaI restriction enzyme recognition sites with the designed sticky ends.
We used NEB’s Q5 PCR annealing temperature calculator to determine that an annealing temperature of 65 C was optimal. We also decided to test annealing at 61.4 C and 59 C. In addition, we planned to use the GC enhancer because our sequence is GC-rich. We prepared reactions as follows:

Therefore, no toxic matters will be produce in our bacteria. Our engineered bacteria have either chloramphenicol resistance or ampicillin resistance, which are widely used in the lab and have been widely confirmed to be safe.
Safe organism
We used and only used E. coli in our experiments. The strain of E. coli we use are TOP10, BL21 and DH5α, which means that all the organism we used in our lab are of group 1 risk. In addition, we separated our organisms from other organisms in the lab that are used by others. There is no phage or virus in our lab and our lab is of group 2 risk.
Safe Shipment
We have already sent our parts to iGEM Headquarters. Our parts are not in the select agents and toxins list. They are safe and well packed. There’s no liquid, no organism, no toxin in the package, only plasmids that are allowed to ship. Our parts are on their way to Boston, bon voyage!
Protocol
Add 1g agarose into 100mL 1×TAE buffer. Boil in miccolumnave oven to dissolve the agarose. The agarose concentration depends on the DNA size. 1% is the most commonly used concentration. Add in 5µl view dye in 100mL solution when it is cooled down to 60℃.
Choose the suitable gel tank and insert the comb. The electrophoresis comb according to the purpose. Pour the fluid agarose gel into the tank. After a complete solidification soak the gel in 1×TAE buffer to make the DNA strips clearer.
Pour enough running buffer into the electrophoresis tank and put the agarose gel in the electrophoresis tank.
Mix the sample with loading buffer sufficiently and load them into the sample lane together with proper marker. The choice of the marker is dictated by the size of the target DNA. Some PCR system already add loading.
Run the electrophoresis under 120V.
fter 15-20 min, put the gel in an UV detector and record the picture.
The 50% glycerin should be autoclaved before use.
Mix 600µl bacteria solution with 600µl 50% glycerin separately in two 1.5mL tubes.
Seal the tubes with parafilm.
Preserve one tube in -20℃ refrigerator and another one in -80℃ refrigerator.

Fermentation is carried out under two conditions. In this first phase growth is carried out as a batch until  glucose is depleted, and will take approximately 13 [h]. After which, cells will be grown to high densities in a   fed-batch. One hindrance for accumulation of high biomass concentrations is the formation of inhibitors as   acetate. By restricting the carbon source this formation can be reduced greatly, which can be viewed in   figure 5. The figure describes the experimental results presented in the research paper used for estimates.   The inoculum is scale linearly as in the case of the substrate. Therefore the same cell concentration is kept   and the time will not be affected. The fed-batch and induction will be discussed further below. Reference: L. Yee and H. W. Blanch.

EPF_Lausanne,2015,Team:EPF Lausanne#Practices_-_-_TEXT.html,"which Prof. Benaroyo also mentioned as being a necessary quality for a scientist): “From a Christian perspective, it is with humility that greatness can be achieved. That is the whole paradox: we are responsible, we are in charge, but we are not Gods ourselves. We do not want to make ourselves Gods”. According to Xavier Gavend, the responsibility stemming from research might be too much for a human being to bear.
Moratoriums, necessary safeguards or obstacles?
Another way to discuss a breakthrough technology, how it should or should not be used, consists in declaring a moratorium, meaning that all research involving the specific technology is interrupted until a general agreement is found between researchers and all other stakeholders. A well-known example of such approach occurred in 1975 when a moratorium concerning genetic manipulation took place in Asilomar. Earlier this year a group of scientists who participated in the discovery of CRISPR-Cas9 called for a worldwide voluntary moratorium in order to discuss the ethical consequences of being able to easily edit and modify the human genome in an inheritable way [4].
Of all the topics covered with the experts, moratorium is the one that caused the most contrasted reactions. We encountered three different points of view on the subject. Some specialists insisted on the necessity of moratoriums, as they allow scientists to avoid making disastrous mistakes in the future and keep working in line with ethics: “I think that the word of caution made by these scientists matches with a broad consensus in the scientific community: we do not wish to modify the human germline in any way”, Prof. Trono affirms, also reminding us that the question of human genome manipulation is not a new one. Jean-Christophe Méroz, member of the legislation division at Swissmedic, emphasized that a moratorium on clinical applications of a technology is not to be confused with a moratorium on the technology itself. “This is my personal opinion”, he precises, “I’d say yes to a moratorium on any research applied to humans (like the one Prof. Jennifer Doudna called for). But let’s keep on doing our research on cells and animals to verify how precisely we can master this technology. [...] A moratorium should avoid future interruptions of preclinical research”. Méroz also made clear the regulatory assessment of the risks of a potential clinical treatment and ethical debates are two totally different things that should not be mixed up nor lead by the same institutions. Prof. Duboule also expressed concerns about fully stopping the research because of a moratorium, as it would represent a waste of time, above all for"

E. coli that glows in paucity of phosphate - at a glance
A. E. coli engineered with BBa_K1682013 or BBa_K1682015 functions as a phosphate biosensor. High concentrations of phosphate indirectly represses PphoA and PphoBR and decreases the expression of GFP.
B. The phosphate sensing promoters BBa_K1682013 and BBa_K1682015 can both detect a gradient of phosphate concentrations. Its activities at 0 and 300 μM were reported in Relative Fluorescence Level (a.u.).
Phosphate associate with essential growth factors for plant root development as well as seed production.
We improved on PphoA, PphoBR. The data provided dynamic range of these promoters.
PphoA , PphoBR and our engineered phosphate sensor BBa_K1682013 and BBa_K1682015 - the full story
Phosphorus is an essential plant macronutrient as it associates with various growth factors for plant root development as well as seed production. Deficiency in phosphorus will result in stunted plant growth. Our aim is to engineer a phosphate sensor in Escherichia coli and detect phosphate level in soil. To this end, we obtained different sequences for PphoA or PphoBR and fused it with gfp (gfpmut3b). The promoters are activated under low phosphate condition, so green fluorescence will be produced to show phosphate level in soil.

Chimeras
In mythology, a chimera is a monstrous creature with parts from multiple animals. In science, the word chimera is used to refer to an organism or a virus which has genetically distinct cells from two (or more) different zygotes or genetic material from other organisms. Also fusion proteins can be called chimeras.
Studying the connection between the different definitions for the word ""chimera"", we came up with the idea to draw a chimera for every team member. To make things interesting, everyone got to decide three different animals. Laura drew each of them during the summer. Here they are all assembled.
The caption under the image tells which chimera belongs to which team member (and which animals each chimera contains).
Every team member got to pick three animals. The combinations were then turned into illustrations of nine different chimeras.

Building the sensor
So we built our own light sensing system using Arduino microcontroller. We got the idea from iGEM 2010 Cambridge team. The sensor used was model TSL238T. Product developed by Texas Advanced Optoelectronic Solutions.
So.... what do you need?? Basically the following
- Arduino Uno USD$25.95- TSL238T High-sensitivity light-to-frequency converter. USD$5.80
- 0.1 uF capacitor USD$9.70 (cost of a pack containing many capacitors)- USB Cable USD$4.37
- Breadboard USD$14.80- Lots of wires USD$2.95
Total cost: USD$63.70 not so bad, right?
Now that you built your sensor according to instructions provided in code below, it should look something like this:
Running the program
Here is the sensor datasheet containing all technical specifications.
Our code. Written by Juano Venegas.

Edinburgh,2013,Team:Edinburgh#Human Aspects#Independence_-_-_TEXT.html," receive milestone payments for the research. That’s perhaps an illustration that you can do very good research but you have to be able to commercialise it. And if you’re taking products to the market then you need the industry input to do that.
J: I believe that our university is recognising it, and trying to liaise with industry.
JE: Yes, I think that the University of Edinburgh is especially good for research. There is for example ground-breaking research in stem cells and regenerative medicine, located at the Bioquarter, and the stem cell medical research centre. They are looking at developing treatments for some of the most debilitating diseases: Parkinson’s disease, multiple sclerosis, diabetes, motor neurone disease, and it’s a bench to bedside approach. What is significant is the level of expertise that is located there, in the Scottish Centre for Regenerative Medicine with 230 researchers, who are working on the stem cells and other regenerative therapies. So you’re getting a critical mass of expertise in one place. Next to that, you’ve got academics and clinicians working together.
J: So what are the plans for the future? If Scotland were to vote ‘yes’ in the next year’s referendum [for Scottish independence], is the Scottish Government going to invest further in the life sciences sector?
JE: Absolutely, this is a priority in the strategic prerogative of government. We ought to build our economy in a sustainable way. The Life sciences has been identified within that as a very important sector. The government is doing a number of things to promote Scotland as a location for inward investment. The government gets this, and as a whole is working together to achieve this ambition for Scotland. One of the ways in which we do that is we bring all of the key industry players round the table, in something called the Scottish Life Sciences Industry Advisory Board (LISAB) which is co-chaired by an industry person called John Brown, and the cabinet secretary for health and wellbeing. So it’s not just a talking shop, there are key objectives and milestones that are agreed within that framework. Having the cabinet secretary around the table makes sure the actions are followed through. One of the actions which came from that is the length of time it takes for commercial clinical trials to be approved being reduced significantly. That’s really important, if a global research company is sitting in the States deciding how to spend this money, how quickly they can get their approval for this research is important, and Scotland is able to offer a very quick turnaround on the approval times for commercial clinical trials. Also, although Scotland is a small country of 5 million people"

Chiba,2008,Team:Chiba#Meeting1_-_-_TEXT.html,"少なかったようなのでどんどん話せるようになったらと思います。 今日あがったプロジェクト案を発表をしたのですが、紙に書いたりしていないので次回は絵つきでプロジェクト案を提出してもらおうと思います。
プロジェクト案をあげていくというところまで来ました。もう少しプロジェクト案をあげていくということをしていこうと思います。 それぞれが自分のだけをよくしていくのではなく、他の人のプロジェクト案にも一つでもよくなるようにコメントしていくということをしましょう。 一人一つずつ上げていけば合計8個改善点が上がるはずです。自分では考えなかったことが出てくると思うので是非やっていきましょう。
次回はブレインストーミング第2回を予定しています。

4/14/08 第3回iGEM勉強会
場所：VBL3階会議室
今回この場所を使うのが初めてで、気分を一新してスタートです。
今回の題目は「セントラルドグマ」ということで、参考書を利用してDNAの転写からタンパク質の生合成までの流れを理解することを目指しました。 参考書を利用することで見通しをよくして、話を進めようとしましたが、どこまでがわかっているのかを確認しつつ進めていったために難航しました。 今回の参考書をよく読めばわかると考えたが、肝心の資料の配布が手間"
Imperial_College,2018,Team:Imperial College#Journal_-_-_TEXT.html," first time, amazing! Thomas redid the stimulation experiment and worked again. We now have big hopes for when the PCB arrives. We had a big meeting with Tom and Rodrigo at 5 pm. We revised who is doing what in the next weeks and revised the parts we are going to submit. Also we focused more on the presentation.
Thursday
The promoter libray results from the plate reader looked interesting. More info are going to be on the wiki.  Ismael brought Ben's cookies for everyone, thank you guardian of the welfare! From the results os the agar plate experiment, we finally picked the right (lowest) sulfite concentration to turn the system off= 0.02%. Our plates look like galaxies! Shiv is working on the banner. Siwat is working on the presenation. No news from the bioengineers...apart that Luis had bread and hummus for lunch.
Friday
We collected the results from the ""ferri"" plate reader results. Unfortunately the plate stopped working at 1 am. So Alberto has to do it again today... At 12:30, presentation with the centre of synthetic biology. Questions that came up: Wooli: IN the introduction part put some iterative sentences, we are jumping in the project too fast. Rochelle: do a better job at explaining that you are trying to achieve. First sentence should be: we are pixcell and we are trying to....You need to tell a story.  Also make it more accessible. For example, PCB what is it. Start with circuitry, not application.  Ismael: try not to split information from the same section into different ones Nicolas: put log scale and make prettier data. Also what information from modelling is actually flowing in the project? Michael: there is no clear application of what our system can do better than optogenetics. It is not application-driven Alice: it would be good to mention that we can explore not only electronics- > biology, but also biology--> electronics. This bidirectionality of communication is one of the main advantages of electrogenetics! Karen: I did not know where I was in the nabar at the top  Albert: in terms of experimantal part, it would be nice to have each slide to have a title that summarises the result, e.g. ""We proved that pyocyanin turns on our system""... etc.. Have it more compartmentlised so that people can follow the story also of experiments. Kirsten: don't be afraid to change your presentation. Also best results should be on the wiki.  Lunch in"
Groningen,2009,Team:Groningen#Buoyant Bacteria_-_-_TEXT.html," can of course be tested by restriction, PCR or sequencing, but it takes more time as another step will be introduced. The vector has two selection markers: Ampicillin and Gentamycin.
Alternative cloning strategy
Another possibility is to use eg. XbaI and SpeI and also cut a vector with these enzymes, this would lead to ligation of the gvp-cluster in one direction. A possible vector for this strategy on the partsregistry is: BBa_J23018 (2298 bp).
Missing information
Used promotor for expression of the gvp-cluster:
Inducible (may be used for proof-of-principle)
Constituative (may be used for proof-of-principle)
Metal sensitive
What kind of vector was used by Li and Cannon (1995) or Melbourne (2007)? Is there a negative effect of high copy number?
What is the maximum amount of pressure gas vesicles can handle? At which depth would this be, how can one put this kind of pressure on a water column?
What is the density of gas vesicles in cells (normally or in case of over-expression)
Modelling parameters:
-Cyanobacteria (Bowen and Jensen, 1965): gas vacuoles made up of gas vesicles (75 nm in diameter and up to 1.0 ,um in length, single wall layer only 2 nm thick) 0,7MPa gives irreversible loss of buoyancy fenotype, but found in next generation.

KULeuven,2011,Team:KULeuven#Law&Patents_-_-_TEXT.html," a general recognition that it’s up to each individual to decide “What his or her own good life is?” It’s even very hard for a country to regulate these intrinsic concerns because they touch upon religion and philosophy, and obviously people have freedom of religion in the Western World. So it’s up to them to decide how (s)he thinks about synthetic biology, which raises some important questions.
“How do you promote good governance in such tough situations?”
It’s obvious that every scientist has to abide by the legislation, not only safety legislation, but everybody must also respect the charter of human rights. But how to relate these to synthetic biology? Because all these fundamental declarations don’t go into the details of the technology, they state that you have to respect human dignity in terms of the biomedical fields. There are declarations about patient (informed consent) and data protection but all these declarations don’t really relate to the matter of whether it’s allowed or not to create a synthetic organism.
There is no real concrete ethical principle for this nor is there any global consensus. However, there are some issues that are covered at global level, for instance there is the UN declaration against Human Cloning. There are some issues where a consensus is reached, but these are scarce, mainly on the core topics, like the use of human stem cells.
There are some groups that are in favor of Human Cloning but by and large the human society is against the idea of human cloning so it’s easy to have a concrete guideline in opposition to that. Stem cell research in contrast is not allowed in certain countries, whereas in other European countries it is.
3. Legislation
Is there a need for a new legislation for synthetic biology?
As it is seen in Figure 1 there is a continuum between genetic engineering and purely synthetic biology as a result of this there will definitely be pressure on the legislation in the coming years as the field of synthetic biology matures. However currently the GMO legislation encompasses all aspects of synthetic biology.

Collaborations
During the iGEM competition we have prioritised building meaningful relationships and collaborations with other teams.         Through them we learned more about other projects, built friendships, experienced the diversity which is inherent to the competition and were able to further improve our own project.         Below are the highlights of our endeavors.
Determining HMF stress responses for iGEM Bordeaux
iGEM team Bordeaux saw an opportunity to collaborate with us when they found out through our social media coverage that our project involved the           detection of bacterial           cell stress.           iGEM Bordeauxs project is about producing a bacterial strain that transforms hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF)           to furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA). iGEM Bordeaux uses HMF in their project as an intermediate               to create FDCA HMF is a byproduct of the degradation of cellulose or other polysaccharides and is known to be toxic to bacteria. FCDA is a platform molecule that can be polymerized in plastics or biofuels.           Because HMF is a known toxin, iGEM Bordeaux suggested it would be interesting for us to test this on our bacterial stress detection system, and we wholeheartedly agreed.
Following a skype session to discuss the details of our collaboration, Bordeaux send us 2mL of solution containing 5 g/L HMF. This allowed us to test the compound at various concentrations on four of our stress detection strains: DnaK is involved in               the process of chromosomal DNA replication[1][2]. Read more about pDnaK on its iGEM registry page pDnaK, RpoE               has been shown to seemingly be involved in the exocytoplasmic stress response. Read more about pRpoE on its iGEM registry page pRpoE, pSoxS has been found to be involved in the superoxide pathway and responds to DNA damage. Read more about pSoxS on its iGEM registry page pSoxS and CspA is involved in cold-shock stress pathways. Furthermore, it is known that the transcription of the CspA-promoter can be               abolished almost               completely by the use of rifampicin or nalidixic acid[3]. Read more about pCspA on its iGEM registry               page pCspA.
Results of exposure to HMF show no stress reaction for the pCspA-G"
Grenoble-Alpes,2018,Team:Grenoble-Alpes#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," the voltage is pretty damn constant with a 100µF capacity:
It is quite important to take care of this stage: if its output voltage is not constant enough, or too far from VD, the output of the amplification stage will not correspond exactly to the voltage of the fluorescence light.
III) Amplification
This is an amplification stage with a single differential OpAmp. I am not sure yet that we will use this stage exactly or a stage which would look more like the one we used for the BE (with a single resistance to set the gain).
This is what we obtain at the output:
The variation is very little,  but once again, the current related to fluorescence is there equal to 10pA, it would be really disappointing: this would mean that the light’s power is equal to almost 0.2nW (responsivity of 0.2A/W).
With a 601 nA current, the output is nearly equal to 1V.
The entire circuit:
N.B.: a capacity might be placed in parallel of the transimpedance’s resistance.  There is no filter stage yet: that is because I don’t know what to filter, this will be determined in the lab.
The bias current of the transimpendance’s AOP must be very low (fA) → model in Chamilo Very high impedance for the follower
Gain yet to be set as we don’t know the current generated from fluorescence.
In itself, there are a lot of advice in Bucci’s lesson → must-read
→ Data will be eventually be acquired with an Arduino and sent to a raspberry pi that can monitor a touch-sensitive screen (cf bibliography)

BEGINNING OF THE FIFA WORLD CUP!!!
Besides that, I tested the memory stage with a 100µF capacitor. There is an unload that is actually non neglectable (200mV/min at the beginning), which means a 3mV/s loss. I don’t know yet what current will give me fluorescence but I hope it will be higher than 3 mV, otherwise, I’ll have to find another way to hold the dark currentvoltage (maybe with the raspberry pi, but I haaaaaate this idea, it is so ugly).

Otherwise, to sum up what I’ve done during the last month :
→ The conditioning circuit works on breadboards, the memory stage is pretty convincing as the capacity unloads 1mV/20s. Working on through-hole components, a polymer capacitor is what"

pMLPm Activation
Title: Validation of pMLPm activation with dCas9-VP64-gRNA and induction of apoptotic signal in HEK293 cells
Conducted by: Liat Tsoran, Mor Pasi and Ori Tulchinsky
Date:  30/9/18-14/10/18
Aim:In this experiment we wanted to validate our synthetic engineered system that should induce apoptotic death by the activation of the synthetic minimal adenovirus major late promoter (pMLPm) via dCas9-VP64-gRNA complex. This experiment is a control experiment aimed at demonstrating the specificity of our system. We have hypothesized that if our system is indeed specfici enough, we will not be able to induce apoptosis in HEK293 cells, as these are human kidney cells and not murine reactive astrocytes cell line, the real target of our"

Overview
The plants root exudates contain TCA intermediates that can attract bacteria having the ability of chemotaxis.  Click here to learn more about root exudates. E.coli has five kinds of chemoreceptors, which interact with factors of the flagella that leads to chemotaxis . But E.coli doesn’t have specific chemotaxis towards some TCA intermediates while Pseudomonas putida has some McpS, like McfQ and McfR. We made a part BBa_K1405004 containing the sequence of McfR, which detects succinate, malate and fumarate. Then we detected its chemotaxis towards malate and succinate, you can download our protocol which is based on the work 2011_Imperial_College_London had done before.click here to see the results. At last, we designed a model to mimic the movement pattern and predict the efficiency of the PromethE.coli Prometheus.

Root exudates
Plants secrete both high- and low-molecular weight compounds from their roots, and these root exudates play an important role not only as nutrients for soil microbes but also as signal molecules in plant–microbe interactions (Sugiyama & Yazaki) . In the wild, legume plants establish symbiotic interactions with rhizobia and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi to obtain several nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphate. The root exudates of legume plants contain organic acids, including some TCA intermediates, such as malate, succinate, citrate and fumarate. Especially, in response to phosphorus starvation, malonie, succinic, fumaric, malic, citric, and t-aconitic acids were detected in the root exudates (Ohwaki & Hirata, 1992) . Here, we"

From 2008.igem.org
Every year over 1.2 million people suffer myocardial infarction (MI). The resulting heart damage requires new approaches for effective repair. Stem cell therapies provide hope. However none of the stem cell therapies currently in clinical trials addresses the need for efficient stem cell targeting to cardiac tissue or the need to replace efficiently dead tissue with new cardiomyocytes. To address these problems, we have built several genetic circuits that work sequentially to repair the heart. First, we have built an inducible differentiation circuit that closely resembles the endogenous differentiation pathway, to program cells to become cardiomyocytes. Second, we have built circuits that use the extracellular domains of chimeric proteins to target cells to damaged cardiac tissue. Upon binding, novel receptor-coupled intein-mediated signaling domains activate effector genes that then aid in integration, inhibition of cell death, and the alteration of the tissue microenvironment.

Hamburg,2017,Team:Hamburg#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," solving it in detail they gave us valuable tips. Their ideas were a raise of the annealing temperature to 72 °C, adding 0.5 M betaine, try adding DMSO in 3 %, 5 % or even 10 % concentration or a combination of both DMSO and betaine. We gave a try to all these suggestions, unfortunately without having a hit. We expected a lane at about 1100 bp.
The PCR was tested with a Q5-High- Fidelity polymerase and a Phusion polymerase but neither led to a positive result.
We discussed the result with the iGEM Team Heidelberg who did not want to give up and gave us additional tips to try. Their next suggestion was to design new primes, as ours had a very high GC content in the middle part and were therefore prone to the formation of secondary structures. Also, the new primer pairs should be designed to anneal at 72 °C. They offered to design to take over the design for us. These were the original primers:
Fw: CATTATGAATTCGCGGCCGCTTCTAGA
Rv: GATAATCTGCAGCGGCCGCTACTAGTA
These are the newly designed primers by the iGEM Team Heidelberg:
Fw: CATTATGAATTCGCGGCCGCTTCTAGATGACCATCACCATC
Rv: GATAATCTGCAGCGGCCGCTACTAGTATTAG
Unfortunately, we did not have enough time at this stage of the project to order and test new primers. Therefore, we will only add the primers to the gene to facilitate the work for the next group who wants to work on the gene.
Even though the gene amplification was not successful in the end, we are very grateful for the help of the iGEM Team Heidelberg, especially Pauline for her advice and not giving up on our problem. Thank you very much!
Harvard
The iGEM team Harvard offered the opportunity to participate in the design process of a set of questions for human practices partner in politics, economics, and science. The questions were targeted to set standards for future surveys so that the results become comparable. And that future teams can easily navigate through interviews with highly qualified personnel originating from the respective fields.
Many teams came together working on the questionnaire, however we want to mention one team especially: Aalto Helsinki, adding a ton of good questions while also fueling the discussion.

Behavioral Analysis of Strains: DH5α, ΔCheZ
and Wild Type MG1655
E.coli performs two types of movements: smooth swimming and tumbling, which is decided by the rotation of the flagellum/flagella. Counter-clockwise rotation leads the bacteria to swim in a straight line, while clock-wise rotation causes the bacteria to tumble in place. As CheZ is essential to determine flagellar rotation, we analyzed the motility of DH5 α strain lacking flagella, ΔCheZ strain K12 AMB1655 from Jian-Dong Huang, and wild type MG1655 on semi-solid medium.
During bacterial growth on the semi-solid medium, the energy source where colonies were visible was consumed first, and the possibility of smooth swimming was increased. We expected that wild type MG1655 would diffuse into the surroundings, and ΔCheZ and DH5α would stay in place. The bacterial colonies were grown to mid-exponential phase (OD0.4-0.6) before they were visible on the semi-solid medium. After 20 hours at 30℃, DH5α stayed immobile and formed smooth colonies (Figure 1.a), while the ΔCheZ strain also stayed in place, but formed uneven edges due to tumbling(Figure 1.b), and wild type MG1655 spread to its surroundings and formed larger colonies in the form of a ring (Figure 1.c). The results show that CheZ indeed influences bacteria motility and thus we can"
