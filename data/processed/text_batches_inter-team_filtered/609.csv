UMaryland,2017,Team:UMaryland_-_-_TEXT.html,"9/sgRNA competent cells with a plasmid constitutively expressing non-mutagenized GFP containing a PAM site (BBa_K2477000) as well as a plasmid containing a constitutive RFP expression system. Both of these plasmid backbones were also pSB3K3. The non-mutagenized GFP served as a negative control as we expected it to be cleaved completely by our Cas9/sgRNA system. The RFP would meanwhile serve as a positive control that should not be cleaved by Cas9/sgRNA as it lacks sequence similarity to the sgRNA base pairing region.
After transformation and rescue, each culture was inoculated into LB cultures containing Kanamycin and Chloramphenicol. Each group contained cultures that were either induced, or not induced with a tetracycline analogue, anhydrotetracycline (ATC), to a final concentration of 400 ng/mL. These cultures were grown overnight and diluted by a factor of 10-5, 10-6, and 10-7 before being plated on LB agar plates with kanamycin.

LB+agar+kanamycin plates of GFP Mutant P2 uninduced (left) with ATC and induced (right) with ATC. Fewer colonies by a magnitude are seen on the plate where Cas9 expression is activated.
The number of colonies on each plate were counted. Colony counts were multiplied by the dilution factor to obtain CFU/mL for each group. Error bars represent standard error between the three plates for each group.
The number of colonies on the (+) ATC plates were divided by the number of colonies on the (-) ATC with the same transformation conditions and dilution factors. Error bars represent the standard error between the three different plates for each group.
From the figures above, we generally observe a lower amount of colonies on plates where the Cas9 cassette was induced compared to when it was not induced. Of all groups, the non-mutant GFP sample has the lowest percentage of colonies in the induced group, which matches our expectations, as the non-mutant should be cleaved by the Cas9/sgRNA complex.
Once the plasmid is cleaved, kanamycin resistance is not passed down to daughter cells"

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Composite Part_-_-_TEXT.html,"Ap2 to ammonium concentration, suggesting that glnAp2 is suitable for ammonia detection in aquaculture water (Fig 4).
Undoubtedly that the working circuit still needs to be further modified, but right now we have demonstrate that it is able to sense the concentration of ammonium and give valid response.
Degradation
For gas part, we successfully found 6 metal-containing enzymes capable of oxidizing N2H4 with O2 as oxidant, and this sets as a footstone for our aerobic ammonium oxidation pathway.
For solid part, we first demonstrate that our bacteria did produce uric acid, which is not an easy task. We cultured bacteria expressing xanthine oxidoreductase (XOR) and bacteria expressing sfGFP under same conditions, and both genes were cloned to the same vector. After 3 days we centrifuged the bacteria culture and resuspended the bacteria in 400mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH=8.5), and added 25uL of xanthine (21mM) as substrate. After shaking at 1100 rpm at 37℃ and centrifuging for 15min, we detected uric acid in the supernatant using HPLC-MS (for detailed protocol, see methods ). By co-analyzing UV absorbance plot at 275nm and MS plot of molecular weight 169, and comparing retention time with standard uric acid sample, we confirmed the presence of uric acid in the supernatant of XOR bearing bacteria but not sfGFP-bearing bacteria (Figure 5). Thus, we successfully fulfilled the production of uric acid.
Next, we demonstrate that by over-expressing key enzymes in de novo purine biosynthesis pathway, uric acid production was elevated in xanthine-provided reactions. Key enzymes were selected according to textbooks (PurF and Prs) and ATP-dependence of corresponding reaction (that is, ATP-dependent enzymes were selected) (Figure 7.). Following the same procedure, we measured the uric acid produced in supernatant after reactions. Results showed that this strategy worked quite well, since 8 groups out of 9 exhibited higher uric acid-producing activity than control group (that is, expressing XOR alone) (Figure 8).
Most importantly, we demonstrate that by over-expressing some of these enzymes, comparative amount of uric acid was produced even without extra xanthine supply (Figure 9). This means that normal nitrogenous substrates can be transferred into purines and be stored in bacteria for uric acid production."

Public Discussion
We had the great opportunity to present ourselves and our project in a café in Bielefeld to the general public. There, about 100 interested visitors listened to Prof. Dr. Alfred Pühler's introduction to synthetic biology and to our talk about iGEM and our MARSS project. The feedback was awesome! Prof. Dr. Pühler and we answered loads of questions of the curious audience concerning both technical and ethical aspects of our research.

Cambridge,2012,Team:Cambridge#Project#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," is possible that this was due to errors in making up the solutions, rather than actually being representative of the riboswitch. This data is very encouraging as the WHO safe limit for fluoride is 1.5mg/L (according to Farooqi et al ) which works out at 79μM. This means our riboswitch is at its most accurate around the safe level for humans. For more information on the implications of this, have a look at our human practices page .
It should be noted that we expected a greater difference in sensitivity between the knockout Bacillus strain provided by Yale, the 168 strain we were using, and the E. coli we used. In the original paper there was a significant, nearly 100-fold, difference in sensitivity between the knock and wild type bacillus strains, but our data did not reproduce this. However, we feel it is actually very positive as it means our part is consistent across multiple chasses, and that it has the desired sensitivity to fluoride, without the need for a special mutant to be ordered. This fits with our goal for our kit to be a standard which is widely compatible.
The next step was to place this construct in a ratiometric fluorescent construct, before eventually testing our luciferase construct with it. But, due to delays in developing the ratiometric construct, we only had one attempt at inserting and testing it and it proved unsuccessful. We shall carry on testing it and, whilst we cannot put our results on here due to the wiki freeze, we hope to present them to you at the jamborees.  However, we would like to include here what we plan to do, in order that future teams might benefit. We plan to insert the fluoride riboswitch into the ratiometrica construct and check that they work together as expected, i.e. get consistent readings for various concentrations, in spite of varying cell densities.
Magnesium Riboswitch
For the magnesium riboswitch, we successfully made the following construct:
The construct made in the pJS130 vector for the detection of changes in Mg2+ ion concentrations
The sequence of this construct was verified via Sanger sequencing.
To characterize this construct, we used a 96-well plate reader to assay the effects of the different concentrations of Mg2+ and IPTG on the levels of GFP. We expected the presence of either to allow the expression of sfGFP, however because transcriptional attenuation by the riboswitch occurs before expression of the repressor protein, it was expected that Mg2+ would somehow demonstrate a dominant effect.
Normalized final fluorescence readings from our construct."

INTEGRATED HUMAN PRACTICES
SUMMARY
Our human practices helped us thoroughly develop our project, from its initial conception to its design and execution. Our project was inspired by Dr. Che-Hong Chen, who came to our school to talk about ALDH2 deficiency. After we decided on our project, we interviewed Dr. Stephanie Hsieh, a medical doctor, and called hospitals to understand what is currently being done about ALDH2 deficiency. We learned that there is a much greater focus on other alcohol-induced diseases, and a relative lack of knowledge about ALDH2 deficiency and its increased cancer risks. This helped reaffirm the importance of both raising awareness and actually developing a treatment--producing recombinant ALDH2 to reduce acetaldehyde buildup in ALDH2 deficient people. As we tested the enzymatic activity of our recombinant ALDH2, we also consulted Dr. Chen, who helped troubleshoot some of the issues we were running into in our functional tests. At first, we ran tests using bacterial cell lysates, but Dr. Chen pointed out that there are too many other factors if we use lysate, and suggested that we add a HIS-tag and purify the protein to get clearer results. This helped tremendously, and we were able to obtain much better results with the purified proteins. Next, we wanted to target acetaldehyde buildup in the upper digestive and respiratory tracts, so we looked to the public for their preferred method of delivery. Our survey showed that people preferred delivery using probiotics, and only wanted to take this treatment if and when they drank. Thus, to learn more about common probiotic strains and the use of probiotics in manufactured food products, we visited Yakult, a yogurt manufacturer. Since Yakult uses Lactobacillus casei, a commonly used and widely known probiotic strain, we also tried to use it as the chassis. Our transformation attempts turned out"

What we have been doing so far is focused on promoting Synthetic Biology and iGEM to general public, in order to provoke thinking and debating of food safety, production sustainability and microorganism drug resistance issues. However, the general public are not the ones who own the knowledge of skills to turn Synthetic Biology into real products. Those who do are gathered in research labs of universities and companies. And they should be our target audience. We hope our efforts can stimulate these researchers' interest in Synthetic Biology, motivating more research work. This is the way we can make Synthetic Biology to change the world.
Enterprise Outreach
During this past summer, we had in-depth discussion with 10 companies. After shown to our drug resistance research work, they grew great interest in related fields. At last, four companies, namely Genewiz, Dongsheng Biotech, TransGen Biotech and Generay Biotechnology became collaborators or sponsors of our project.
The following is some products supported by our sponsors. Genewiz also provided very lower discount for our gene synthesis of polykitide synthase domains and gave funding on our team uniform and brochure.

Advocating the importance of the infection is one thing but once the owners of the animals do not see the economic loss big enough that it hurts them they will not do the diagnosis.
Kai:
No prevalence of trachoma in developed countries. Why?
Prof. Sachse:
It is mainly the hygiene, of course climate could contribute to that but it's mainly the hygiene.
Daniel C.:
So the first aim should be to improve hygiene in underdeveloped countries
Prof. Sachse:
Yes.
Daniel C.:
Thank you for the interview
Prof. Sachse:
My pleasure.
Note:Concerning the discussion of the hypothetical distribution of the device, we decided a few days later against outsourcing the incapsulation to national centralized laboratories. Instead the devices would be prepared at the production center and then shipped with the diagnostic bacteria, to be distributed throughout the country.

Dr. Thomas Meyer has studied and developed Chlamydia trachomatis diagnostic methods for clinical applications since 1990, working in the public as well as in the private sector. He is a foremost expert in the Chlamydia trachomatis life-cycle, working now as a researcher at the University Clinic Hamburg-Eppendorf.
Finding Chlamydory:
Introduction and description of our project.
Dr. Meyer:
The first question about your project. I think that it is a really good project and a really good idea and the technical procedure is absolutely trendy, to use microfluidic devices and to incorporate biosensors, another point is the test uses the point of care. It is a cheap assay, which it is exactly what is needed in some parts of the world, where the laboratory equipment, as we have it here in Germany is not present. It is important to have a device that can be used everywhere, if you look at Africa, Malawi, for example, there can be people that are infected that can not go to the next physician because they can be very far away and even if they do this long journey they will need the results immediately, they can not come back some days later when the results are present. So itˋs very important to have a point of testing and itˋs also important"

ATOMS-Turkiye,2015,Team:ATOMS-Turkiye#Project#Ulcer2_-_-_TEXT.html," a common set of cytoplasmic signaling proteins: CheW and CheA interact with receptor molecules to form stable ternary complexes that generate stimulus signals; CheY transmits those signals to the flagellar motors, CheZ controls their lifetime; CheR (methyltransferase) and CheB (methylesterase) regulate MCP methylation state.  Abbreviations: OM (outer membrane); PG (peptidoglycan layer of the cell wall); CM (cytoplasmic membrane)
As in many biological signaling systems, the signaling currency in the E. coli chemotaxis pathway is reversible protein phosphorylation (Fig. 5).  However, the principal signaling chemistry is a bit different in prokaryotes and eukaryotes.  CheA is a kinase that uses ATP to autophosphorylate at a specific histidine residue.  Phospho-CheA molecules then serve as donors for autokinase reactions that transfer phosphoryl groups to specific aspartate residues in CheY and CheB.  Phospho-CheY enhances CW rotation of the flagellar motors; phospho-CheB has high MCP methylesterase activity.  The active forms of these response regulators are short-lived because they quickly lose their phosphoryl group through spontaneous self-hydrolysis. CheZ further enhances the dephosphorylation rate of phospho-CheY to ensure rapid locomotor responses to changes in the supply of signaling phosphoryl groups to CheY.
CheW couples the autophosphorylation activity of CheA molecules to chemoreceptor control.  Receptors, CheW, and CheA form stable ternary signaling complexes that modulate the influx of phosphoryl groups to the CheY and CheB proteins in response to chemoeffector stimuli.
Figure 3: Phosphorelay signaling.  The flagellar motors of E. coli spin CCW by default; the signaling pathway modulates the level of phospho-CheY, the signal for CW rotation.  Reactions and components that augment CW rotation are depicted in green; those that augment CCW rotation are depicted in red.
Chemoreceptor signaling states in E.coli
The signaling activities of chemoreceptors are described by a two-state model (Fig. 6).  Receptor complexes in the CW signaling state activate CheA, producing high levels of phospho-CheY.  Receptors in the CCW signaling state deactivate CheA, resulting in low levels of phospho-CheY.  Thus, the behavior of the flagellar motors reflects the relative proportion of"

Prof. Rogler therefore suggests using Lactobacillus or Lactococcus lactis as hosts. These genera are not known to increase immune response. The former are already being used as probiotics in IBD patiens and the latter have been used in clinical trials with only minor adverse effects.[2]
On the topic of current methods to investigate microbiome composition, Prof. Rogler stated that tissue samples are taken during endoscopy. Through 16S RNA sequencing the distribution of bacterial populations can be asserted on the phylum level and in some cases even species level. However, such an analysis cannot discern between bacteria that are present and functional and those that are non-functional. A dysbiosis is found in all cases.
Our analysis with nitric oxide (NO) and N-acyl homoserine lactone (AHL) might be a useful tool to investigate simultaneously the state of inflammation and microbiome composition, yet it all depends on the sensitivity of the system. Currently, inflammation is measured through calprotectin levels in the feces of patients; one would have to compare the calprotectin analysis to the measurement of NO in order to assert its effectiveness.
Finally, in order to make the project clinically feasible, we would need to encapsulate our bacteria. There are certain properties in the pill that we need to look out for to make it safe for administration. The material needs to withstand, even partial, digestion by stomach acid and pancreas enzymes. The bacteria need to be prevented from migrating out of the pill and colonizing the gut. Although, the colonization itself is not a safety issue, as a clinical study of L. lactis showed[2], it is certainly not a desirable trait.
Prof. Christophe Lacroix
Our project relies heavily on the sensing of bacterial signaling molecules and metabolites in order to draw conclusions on the factors that affect IBD. Prof. Lacroix was able to point us to interesting markers that our system could sense, in order to determine what role they play in IBD.
The first suggestion he made in order to improve our system was to introduce a health marker that could be replaced with the inflammation marker nitric oxide (NO). This will be useful once we want to compare healthy individuals with IBD patients, in order to establish the difference between the two states. His suggestion was to use butyrate as this candidate marker, as it is a metabolite whose concentration is reduced significantly during IBD.
The most interesting suggestion was that of sensing metabolic intermediates, such"

We submitted all four recombinases as T7-LacO-regulated generator, in pSB1C3 and contain no illegal sites ( BBa_K2406081 , BBa_K2406082 , BBa_K2406083 , BBa_K2406084 ).
Restriction enzyme digestion followed by gel electrophoresis proved that our SCre and VCre generators have their illegal sites removed. SCre and VCre are the original construct; SCremut1 is after removing the first illegal PstI site, and SCremut2 are after removing the second illegal PstI site. Similarly, VCremut1a and 1b are after removing the illegal PstI site. U: uncut. XbaI: miniprep cut with XbaI.  PstI: miniprep cut with PstI.
T7-LacO-regulated Cre generator
We have successfully cloned T7-LacO out of pET28b, and used the cloned fragment to perform a five-part MoClo                 assembly. The assembled T7-LacO-regulated Cre generator was then cloned into biobrick format ( BBa_K2406080 ).
Standardized measurement constructs
We have created standardized measurement constructs to quantify recombinase activity in vivo. They are essentially                 transcriptional terminator flanked by two recombination target sites, inserted between a constitutive promoter                 and a RFP gene. Of fifteen possible combinations for five recombinases (Cre, Dre, VCre, SCre, Vika), we have                 successfully generated, sequenced, and submitted twelve of them:
The biobrick number of the measurement devices generated
We also demonstrated that the measurement devices can be used as a molecular switch, expressing RFP in the presence of correct combination of target sites and recombinases:
The measurement devices can act as a biological switch, expressing RFP in the presence of IPTG. Plates on the left have IPTG added, whereas those on the right have no IPTG. 9A: Measurement device Vox-Vox in Vika-expressing cell; 12A: Measurement device Rox-Rox in Dre-expressing cell; 6A: Measurement device Slox-Slox in SCre-expressing cell; 5A: Slox-Vlox in SCre-expressing cell, acting as a negative control.

Overview
The human practice part of XJTLU-CHINA team for 2016 is significantly highlighted throughout the whole process of running the project. Based on the theme of “Youth Research” this year, lots of activities such as seminars, public speeches and road show are held aiming at providing public education not only for university students, but also for children, teenagers, and old people. The content of those public activities is adapted from the project and effectively integrated with knowledge which different ages of people are thirsty for gaining. Through those activities, the public perception is promoted as well with our scientific knowledge and detailed examples. Furthermore, our human practice activities aim at a deeper understanding about how biologists help the achievement of long-term sustainability with the knowledge equipped with, how scientists deal with the ethics issues, how biologists can facilitate policy-making and how intellectual products can be transferred into real life.

Elan_Vital_Korea,2015,Team:Elan Vital Korea#Background_-_-_TEXT.html," very interesting, is not to be completed until 2020, and still requires incubation, as well as being expensive.
Our Hypothesis: Possibility of Using Quorum
Sensing for Early Detection
Our team, Elan Vital Korea, addressed the problem of rapidly detecting antibiotic-resistant bacteria. We were interested in a rapid and efficient method of antibiotic resistance detection, and we believed that such a method could be engineered using quorum sensing.  Our hypothesis was that we would be able to use quorum sensing – a method bacteria use to communicate with each other – to make the cells quickly report the existence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria
By quorum sensing, bacteria can perform many cooperative functions, such as biofilm formation, antibiotic production, motility, swarming, virulence, and much more.  While most quorum sensing takes place between bacteria of the same species, there are cases of interspecies quorum sensing.  Auto-inducers affect the gene expression of the bacteria once they reach a certain concentration threshold.  Bacteria using quorum sensing usually produce small amounts of auto-inducers, so that the concentration of auto-inducers are affected by the concentration of the bacteria. In other words, quorum sensing, in essence, regulates gene expression in response to cell density. Using quorum sensing, bacteria are able to act in unison, as if they were a single organism.
Quorum sensing is widely used by various bacteria for various functions, so each uses a slightly different auto-inducer so the signals are not mixed up.  In general, gram-negative bacteria use a class of molecules called N-acyl homoserine lactones, or AHL, while gram-positive bacteria use short processed polypeptides.
For example, the picture below represents the quorum sensing mechanism in the bacteria vibrio fisheri.  Vibrio fisheri is a bacteria that produces bioluminescence, and is famous for revealing quorum sensing for the first time.  Vibrio fisheri uses quorum sensing to produce light in high cell density, and researchers first discovered quorum sensing from examining vibrio fisheri.
In vibrio fishri, quorum sensing involves LuxI and LuxR as well as AHL.  LuxI is the protein that produces AHL, and LuxR forms a complex with AHL to affect the regulation of genes.  In this case, it produces luciferase, which produces bioluminescence. Furthermore, the process also boosts the production of LuxI, which creates a positive feedback loop.  This AHL-LuxR quorum sensing mechanism is one of the most well known gram"

LMU-TUM_Munich,2016,Team:LMU-TUM Munich#Attributions_-_-_TEXT.html," into an iGEM project. Likewise, the idea for our bioprinting project is far older than just this year – at least in theory. The life science students finally assembled around last February, eagerly suggesting various ideas for several promising potential iGEM projects that they had in mind. The project ideas that were developed most involved i) transforming the planet Mars with bacteria, ii) creating a vegan substitution product for milk, and iii) bioprinting. While we considered the bioprinting project to be the most intriguing idea, last year's TU Delft iGEM team had unfortunately already developed an excellent project on bioprinting. Thus began a long discussion of whether it would be in our team's best interests to participate with another bioprinting project. In the end, however, we agreed that the next years of iGEM will most likely witness the establishment of a separate bioprinting track and that this topic has extraordinary potential. By the way, it was much encouraging to listen to Randy in Paris when he described the potential of SynBio and chose bioprinting of organs for an example! At this point, our last doubts melted, and we were wholly confident that our project choice was just right.
Our principal investigators (PIs)
As implied above, it was very difficult to convince a professor at TUM of an iGEM participation, and at LMU as well it was cumbersome to find a PI enthusiastic about iGEM now that Prof. Mascher has left Munich. The initial motivation to found this year's iGEM team was sparked by the Graduate Center GRK 2062: Molecular principles of synthetic biology, which desired to re-establish the iGEM competition in Munich.
Prof. Dr. Jung (one of our secondary PIs, LMU) is the head of this graduate center and thus impulsed the creation of a team by recruiting students. Wanting to share the project she (and the GRK) looked for a lab participating in the graduate center that could host the iGEM team as main lab. During the summer we had access to lab space in her department, where we could perform cloning  steps and other work. This was of great help, as the distance between LMU and TUM at Weihenstephan Campus is more than 2 h with public transportation. We are grateful for Prof. Jung's support even though towards the end we decided to rejoin into our main lab.
Prof. Dr. Skerra (our main PI, TUM) already filled the role of the main PI of TUM's"

Overview
fishPHARM’s mechanical engineering work centers around two main principles: 1) the real-world implementation of a peptide treatment for bacterial coldwater disease (BCWD), and 2) the prevention of bacterial coldwater disease outbreaks on fish farms. To address these goals, fishPHARM has developed engineering solutions for the individualized delivery of flavocide, our bioengineered peptide treatment for BCWD, as well as a fish farm tank monitoring system for the constant monitoring of aquaculture conditions.
fishPHARM presents fishBIT, a novel means of delivering time-released flavocide gel to each fish individually. Inspired by fish tags, devices used to track fish in the wild, fishBIT allows fish farmers to target specific fish for flavocide treatment. Farmers can choose to apply the fishBIT system to a few affected fish, or to their whole farms. Each delivery device can store enough flavocide to treat one fish for the prescribed dosing period, as well as be easily re-dosed, making it an effective means of treating multiple and recurring infections. The device operates through passive diffusion of flavocide suspended in a medical hydrogel. FishBIT is safe for the fish, and is constructed using materials which are all approved by the FDA. Testing of the fishBIT system in a hydraulic flow channel has shown that fishBIT can resist normal fish motion and speeds.
FishPHARM presents the Heimdall Monitoring System (HMS). Named after the Norse god of surveillance, the HMS consists of sensor hardware to be installed within aquaculture tanks, as well as a mobile app for the continuous monitoring and collection of temperature, flow rate, dissolved oxygen concentration, and nitrogen concentration. These factors are important in the health of a fish hatchery, and if improperly maintained, will lead to infections and higher mortality rates. Current methods of monitoring these factors are inefficient and not as reactive to changes in conditions. The HMS is still in its development phase. A first prototype of the hardware is in the process of being built, and the mobile app is ready for testing.
Future work will be done at fishPHARM to improve the design and"

Tomorrow we'll make a ligation, and as soon as the primers arrive we'll be able to add LacI with Gibson assembly. Ligation results show 2 bands, as expected, however they are too big...
Vincent got the plates containing the tetR mutants: only the control worked, and not spectacularly well at that. The LB plates were not very good, so a new batch of plates was made with what was left of the previous day's transformation (kept overnight in the 4 C fridge). Unlike the previous plates, the sample mutagenesis plates were not covered with IPTG and Xgal, since these mutageneses do not benefit from such treatment.

Lilia measured the competence of DH5alpha cells prepared by Clara, Lilia and Alina according to the second (Inoue) protocol for chemically competent cells, they were pipetted on Tuesday by Clara and Lilia. On Wednesday 20µl of cells were transfected with 100, 50 and 10pg of the plasmid containing GFP-TetR. The 10pg plate is shown on the picture.  Competence is 10^8 CFU/µg.
Nadine ligated the pSB3K1 Pconst-tetR that should not contain RFP anymore. She also transformed it into Henrike's and our new competent cells.
Vincent got the fresh plates out of the incubator, only to find that the P39Q-Y42M was the only mutation that had grown colonies (only 2), which we consider to be an accident given that there ought to be hundreds of colonies. After poring through the protocol yet again, we spotted a mistake in the original dilution approach. Vincent went ahead and re-ran another PCR, digestion, transformation sequence, and we will see how the plates look tomorrow. In the meantime, a few emails have been sent back and forth with Cambridge's Bill Collins over the possibility of adding modules to the current Gibthon program. Discussions are ongoing.
Alessandro searched literature for T7 variant with different strength to use them in the T7-Lysis plasmid.
Lilia run MITOMI on spotted de Brujin library with GFP-wtTetR expressed off-chip with SP6 ITT. Everything went well, but no strong interactions were seen. Chip fabrication, spotting, alignement and the whole experiment was done by Lilia. Clara's wafers were used.

On 16th of September, there was an awesome gathering for all biologists in café Loburg. It was organized by iGEM team with some tipps and advices from the science café team. This edition was about “synthetic biology, towards the creation of life?” and the speakers were Prof dr. Arnold Driessen (University of Groningen) and dr. Dirk Stemerding (Rathenau institute) and as the side-kick Pieter van Boheemen , who is a DIY biohacker. It turned to be a really success!

New primers to clone GFP+Actin construct for parts registry
13.09.2013 – 15.09.2013
We ordered primers with standard 10 restriction sites for cloning our GFP+Actin construct into the recommended plasmid for parts registry. With these primers,  actin-GFP constructs were amplified by PCR. Then PCR products and parts registry plasmids were digest to obtain the compatible restriction sites and ligated to each other.
Alignment of Chromoprotein sequencing results
10.09.2013
We checked whether the sequence of the chromoprotein encoding genes had remained unchanged by sending it out for sequencing. Then the results were compared with the original sequence from parts registry. For aeBlue, mRFP and amilGFP  chromoprotein gene, the identity was almost 100%.

Calgary,2012,Team:Calgary#Project#HumanPractices#Killswitch#Regulation_-_-_TEXT.html,"0.2% glucose whereas GFP is significantly upregulated with 0.2% rhamnose and even more with 0.5% rhamnose. In this system we do not have the RhaS constitutively expressed and therefore GFP may not be expressed in the the control without either glucose or rhamnose. But, we are currently working on building this circuit and will be characterizing the RhaS with Prha and Prha by itself using GFP as a reporter.
Additionally, we also tested the rhamnose system with micrococcal nuclease in the presence of glucose and rhamnose in both Top10 cells as well as glyA knockout from the Keio knockout collection on the Synergy Page to compare the GlyA knockout alone, GlyA knockout with killswitch, Top10 with killswitch.
The Glycine Auxotroph
The idea of using an auxotropic system was initially considered, however due to the pricing of this system we felt it to be inappropriate for a large scale bioreactor. Auxotrophic systems that we had looked into included the 5-fluoro-orotic acid and histidine, which were both found to be expensive. This idea was reconsidered when our Flux Variability Analysis showed that the Petrobrick system can be optimized with glycine added to the media. The production of hydrocarbons increased by a factor of 3 with our glycine media when compared to Washington’s production media. This finding justified our introduction of a glycine auxotrophic system as the increased efficiency of the Petrobrick in addition to another safety feature far outweighed the cost of implementing the system. This is feasible because glycine is not readily found in the environment and is relatively inexpensive to supplement on a large scale.
We used a knockout strain JW2535-1 from the Keio collection in which the gene responsible for the synthesis of glycine was knocked out. The bacteria become dependent on glycine in the environment. The JW2535-1 knockout strain used works directly on glyA which is a component of the glycine hydroxymethyltransferase by mutating the glyA into Kan which overall prevents the bacteria’s growth. A glycine assay was set up to determine concentrations of glycine needed for the survival of the bacteria. The bacteria were grown on minimal media plate with glycine concentrations ranging from 1 nM to 100 mM. When zero glycine was added to the media there was some bacterial growth over time. This system will therefore need to work in conjunction with the kill switch system as another layer of security to reduce possibility of"

Uppsala,2018,Team:Uppsala#Result_-_-_TEXT.html," the decrease in resistance development and the improved physical health of horses.
Survey Analysis
When we had chosen to create a worm buster, we wanted to see if there was a market for this kind of product. To gain knowledge about the market we conducted a market analysis together with the human practises group. The modeling group worked with creating a analysis program that could use the information from the market analysis and see if correlations could be found between different variables.
Future Possibilities
The small strongyles’ larger cousin, Strongylus Vulgaris, is the most pathogenic parasite in horses, posing a significant threat[1]. They, like small strongyles, live in the grass and and infect the horse after being ingested [3]. During the different larval stages inside the horse, the parasite enters the intestinal blood vessels as a part of their life cycle [4,10]. Because of this, they generally can’t be targeted by deworming drugs or detection methods and can cause major problems for domestic animals [7].
Due to this, an efficient diagnostic tool that can be applied to grass samples are necessary to prevent ingestion of large strongyles. This is why we looked into the possibility of a second worm buster targeting large strongyles could be possible in the future.
Figure 6: Large strongyles.
Symptoms
When the worms migrate into the arteries they cause inflammation in the arterial wall and induce the formation of blood clots. When a small blood clot forms it may form an embolism which can detach and travel in the bloodstream until it reaches and blocks smaller blood vessels. This prevents oxygen and nutrient supply to surrounding tissues and may result in colic [13]. This can cause problems in the animals, with the worst case scenario being death [3].
Having these parasites is obviously a huge problem and there is great need for methods that can detect the parasites before ingestion, preventing infection. This makes the need for the second worm buster even larger.
Current Methods for Detection
To be able to count either small or large strongyles, the current methods require growing their eggs from samples and counting them.  The disadvantage is that this method only works for adult strongyles that have already laid eggs! This technique only makes it possible to detect strongyles after the infection which is a huge disadvantage! Other methods for detection, such as using an ELISA test or a PCR based method are expensive and require a high level of expertise [11, 12, 16].
In conclusion, the current need is a simple detection method which could be applied to grass samples to be able to check if a pasture is secure for horses to gra"
Tokyo_Tech,2010,Team:Tokyo Tech#Project#wolf coli#System_-_-_TEXT.html,"  The response regulator of phytochrome does not directly regulate gene expression, so they fused a cyanobacterial photoreceptor from Cph1 to an E. coli intracellular histidine kinase domain and response-regulator from EnvZ–OmpR.  Moreover, Cph1–EnvZ chimaeras were then activated by introduction of two phycocyanobilin-biosynthesis genes that convert heme into phycocyanobilin.
In weak red light condition, Cph1–EnvZ chimeras are activated. EnvZ is autophosphorylated and passes phosphoryl group intramolecularly to OmpR.  Then, phosphorylated OmpR binds to OmpC promoter and activates the transcription of the downstream gene. In strong red light condition, Cph1–EnvZ chimaeras are not activated. EnvZ is dephosphorylated, and thus phosphorylation of OmpR doesn’t occur.  Then, OmpR can’t bind to OmpC promoter, Therefore, the transcription of the downstream gene doesn’t occur.
The important point in this system is, light intensity determines expression of the ratio of phosphorylated OmpR.
Band-detect network
Band-detect network exhibits transient gene expression in response to concentration of chemical signals [2].  Previously, USTC(2008) attempted to build this circuit and registered parts for this circuit[3].
According to Basu’s group paper, LuxR, an AHL-dependent transcriptional regulator was used. LuxR activates the expression of cI and LacIM1.  LacIM1 shows weaker repression than LacIWT because it has a lower affinity to lac promoter (Fig. 4-3-5).
Figure 4-3-5.Band-detect network
Figure 4-3-6.Band-detect network
・High concentration of AHL(Fig. 4-3-6a) results in high levels of cI and LacIM1 and repression of GFP.
・At low concentration of AHL(Fig. 4-3-6b),  Lac IM1 and cI are expressed only at basal levels. This enables the expression of a LacIWT, again resulting in GFP repression.
・At intermediate concentration of AHL (Fig. 4-3-6c), this results in moderate levels of cI and LacIM1. However, because the repression efficiency of cI is significantly higher than that of LacIM1, cI effectively shuts off LacI expression while the LacIM1 concentration is below the threshold required to re"

Grow up cells of your choice in conical flasks in LB (under 1 hour if 1:5 dilution; if longer growth time desired dilute in 1:20, 1:50, or even 1:100 as necessary). Stop incubation of these cells at OD600 ~ 0.4 - 0.7, then wash with unsupplemented M9 salts to halt growth. These cells can then be used for microscopy and flow cytometry.
Microscopy: remember to book the microscope under the “confocal” sheet outside the door. Also, after completing session, consult Chris for demonstration on how to clean up microscope objective lens.
Flow cytometry: Consult Chris to arrange a time when George is also available, and work out how to use the flow cytometer properly.
Microscopy image analysis: If no one else has a laptop with MATLAB installed, grab Leon to learn microscopy image processing from Chris. Before that, get Leon to copy all the image files we’ve had thus far out of the microscopy PC.
Week 5
Day 36
Tasks
Basically repeat as much of the Day 35 workflow as possible, briefly:
Wash overnight cultures in M9 media (unsupplemented) for single-read fluorescence and OD600
Wash overnight cultures in modified M9 media (+ thiamine supplement) for growth curve
Set up flasks of washed culture (appropriate dilution) in modified M9 media (+ thiamine supplement) for microscopy and flow cytometry.
Day 37
M9 salts haven't arrived, should start interlab from making M9 media. Same as usual, except please do catch GDubz for cytometry.
Wash overnight cultures in M9 media (unsupplemented) for single-read fluorescence and OD600
Wash overnight cultures in modified M9 media (+ thiamine supplement) for growth curve
Set up flasks of washed culture (appropriate dilution) in modified M9 media (+ thiamine supplement) for microscopy and flow cytometry.
Day 38
Focus on MGs
Flow cytometry - 1/25 cultures in at 9.20
Set up for growth curves (only have 2 sets)
Trouble shooting for microscopy
Ask Chris to go through using the microscope
Try a 1/10 dilution
Day 39
Grow falcon tubes - DH5alpha this time → for cytometry and microscopy (1:25 dilution for flask shown to be good for MG)

Ethic collaborations
We wanted to support the debates around ethics in science, in fact we also developped several points with our specialist in epistemology.
Therefore answering the Valencia poll was the opportunity to widen our range of questions about biosciences, to share knowledge, and to prove that we feel concerned by the problem that ethics tackles.
All the team answered the poll and we are grateful to Valencia for rewarding us with a gold medal ^^
Software tool collaborations
In order to develop a fully operational tool we created a poll that we send to other igem team to ask if it could be a great help for them or not and if they have also advices and expectations concerning this software.
2 Teams answered :
TUDelf Specially to Sriram and Tim
Valencia Specially to Juny
We had some interactions with the Freiburg_software team , specially with Paul Staab. They have developed a synthetic biological software suite, based on Google's collaboration and communication tool Wave : SynBiowave. The actual version is 0.2 but it is a project with a great potential!

Schematic representation of Groningen 2011’s project design
Abstract: “Our project aims to design a genetic device able to count and memorize the occurrences of an input signal. We achieved this by utilization of auto-inducing loops, that act as memory units, and an engineered riboregulator, acting as an AND gate. The design of the device is modular, allowing free change of both input and output signals. Each increase of the counter results in a different output signal. The design allows implementation of any number of memory units, as the AND gate design enables to extend the system in a hassle-free way. In order to tweak bistable autoinducing loops we need a very fast and robust method for characterizing parts. For this we have created a genetic algorithm that will enable us to find parameters of the parts used in the design. It also allows the combination of data from multiple experiments across models with overlapping components.”

Abstract: 'Essencia coli' is a vanillin producing bacterium equipped with a control system that keeps the concentration of vanillin at a constant level. The showpiece of the project is the feedback mechanism. Vanillin synthesis is initiated by irradiation with blue light. The preferred concentration can be modulated using the intensity of that light. At the same time the bacterium measures the amount of vanillin outside the cell and controls its production to maintain the set point. The designed system is universal in nature and has therefore potential benefits in different areas. The concept can easily be applied to other flavours and odours. In fact, any application that requires a constant concentration of a molecular substance is possible.

As the finance manager I was first of all responsible for the external collaborations and communications. Getting in touch with companies and other stakeholders to receive funds and enthuse them about our project. Besides taking care of all funding, I also was the treasurer of our team, tracking our budget closely. Furthermore, as part of the core labteam, I have spent a lot of time in the wetlab making our constructs and characterizing them. At last, I also made a significant contribution to the policy and practice by co-writing our strategy report and the organization of several outreach events.
Liza
Modeling Manager
As a modeling manager I was responsible for making models underlying the work of the lab team. In order to create these models a good understanding of the physics was required and therefore I also have studied a lot of physics concepts. Therefore I also talked with experts. With my knowledge of the underlying physics I also assisted and advised the lab team. Furthermore I have helped Charlotte with building the optical setup. I also was involved in characterizing the lasing in both the optical setup we build as the microscope of the university. Furthermore I made Transmission microscopy images of the vesicles of the Wageningen team and of our silica  covered cells.

SMMU-China,2018,Team:SMMU-China#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," our school. Learning about this news, the iGEM team members are both excited and a little worried. We were excited about this excellent opportunity to show synthetic biology to everyone. Anyway, we decided to seize this opportunity. After active preparation, we successfully held an exchange meeting between iGEM and synthetic biology on the evening of August 3. The exchange introduced the concept of synthetic biology with the tyrannical Tyrannosaurus Rex in the science fiction film Jurassic World 2, showing the magical charm of synthetic biology. We also introduced detailed information about the iGEM competition, highlighting the creative and applied skills of the high school students who participated in the competition that inspired them to participate in iGEMer's high school student team. After a brief report, we used the form of interactive questions, asked the students questions on the  knowledge we mentioned, and presented a set of commemorative postcards with their own school features for the right friends. During the presentation of the poster, the students spoke freely and asked various questions to our team members, showing a strong interest in synthetic biology and iGEM. More than an hour of activity soon ended in a warm atmosphere. All that was hoped was that more young students could become interested in the field of synthetic biology, to explore, to think, to discover, to change.
Gold-integreted up
The human practice parts of our project focuses on the promotion of our project and gets feedback from what we have done. During our internship, we watched too many patients suffered from HF and died for that. Thus, we designed a questionnaire to investigate patients’ current situation. On the other hand, we talked to the doctors to find out the defect in treatment. With these preparations, we asked our PI for some suggestions. Then, we designed a nanobody to stop the process of heart failure on the basis of synthetic biology. At the same time, we consulted a Nobelist and some chiefs in cardiovascular department to improve our design. Communication with other teams helped us to fulfill for the competition. New media, visits to summer camp and geracomium promoted our project. Our human practice came from clinical disease and go back to the susceptible people.
Current status of heart failure treatment
To get better understanding of heart failure, we visited the department of cardiology in Changhai and Changzheng hospital. By means of questionnaire and communication with the patients, we came to know that HF patients had to stay about 20 days per year in hospital to receive treatment. HF not only costs a huge amount of money but also reduced patients’ life quality. When consulting the experienced clinical doctors,"

Possible Explanation:              - Adding Mn ions instead of Fe could be effected the Magnetization               - The red Fluorescence gen contains a cadaverin chain, this could explain the non-fluorescence.

Degradation rate of CsgA 14 must be taken into account due to suboptimal conditions
R12
CsgB → 0
0.03
Degradation rate of CsgB 14 must be taken into account due to suboptimal conditions
We calculated the reaction rate of R8 (CsgB + CsgA -> fibril) as follows:
The average length of an amino acid is 0.8nm15.  The length of CsgA is 82 amino acids16, so a non-folded CsgA protein is 65.6 nm in length.  CsgA's tertiary structure is folded into 517 so the length of a CsgA protein in a curli is 13.1 nm.  A curli is several micrometers long (~3000nm)18 so there are around 299 CsgA molecules per curli.  The production of CsgA is the limiting step in the production of curli fibrils (compared to production of CsgB) so the forward rate for this reaction is 1/299.
Results
The following graph shows that fibrils are produced at a rate of around 1 every three hours.

The digestion did not work well, because there wasn't enough DNA.  We decided to change.
Digestion system (XbaI and PstI) 1 hour at 37°C
- 18ul of Water
- 2ul of DNA
- 1ul of endonucleases
- 5ul of NEB 3 buffer
Eletrophoretical profile of the digested samples:
1. DH5a E0840
2. JM110 E0840 colony 1
3. JM110 E0840 colony 2
4. JM110 E0840 colony13
5. JM110 E0840 extracted from theKit
6. JM110 E0840 colony 13  extracted with the Kit
7. DH5a K346004
8. JM110 K346004
We ran the reaction once again in the same location.
Eletrophoretical profile of the digested sample:
Based on the eletrophoretical profile we have come to a conclusion that has been a partial digestion.

Business
Figure 1: Business model canvas for PAST.
We in PAST believe that our product is a valuable addition to the toolbox of researchers and educators. But believing is not knowing, and therefore an investigation was conducted to conclude whether this presumption is wrong. This evaluation consists of a business canvas, a market analysis based on iGEM teams from 2014 and a cost analysis, allowing us to assess if profit margins are large enough to verify our assumption.
A market analysis was conducted to determine how many batches PAST should be able to produce per year. The analysis is based on the competitors of iGEM 2014. These teams are at the forefront of synthetic biology and therefore it is assumed, that they represent the future of the field. Every team who has succeeded in making their wiki has been considered. The results can be viewed in the following pdf ( Market analysis iGEM 2014 ).

University_College_London,2012,Team:University College London#Notebook#Week7_-_-_TEXT.html," out to Science Magazines to the raise the profile of the events we are running over the next few weeks, including the upcoming speed debating and DIYbio.
Saturday 28th July
Island Collaborative Art: Carina and Yeping made a prototype for our island out of plaster to be used an interactive display at Southbank event this Sunday.
Sunday 29th July
Southbank Engagement: Martina, Yeping and Aurelijia put up a stand at Southbank with our poster and island prototype on display to tell the public about our project. This allowed part of the wet lab team to have experiences of engaging with the public. They also gave out leaflets which invited members of public to take part in our upcoming speed debating event.
Reflections
This week was full of activity for the team. The Munich conference went smoothly, and we were all pleased our project was received very well by attendees there. We have also enjoyed the collaboration with Munich, and we are looking forward to continuing the communication. The Lab team who remained in London also managed to do a great deal of lab work, but we are still encountering various problems with transforming BioBricks. The reasons for this are not clear, and are likely to vary between experiments. However, we hope to resolve some of the issues next week in order to begin assembly. Overall, we are a little disheartened by the difficulties we continue to encounter in the lab, and the barriers that face us in setting up the ambitious DIYbio event. However, we are encouraged by the progress they both continue to make, even if it is not as quickly as we would wish.

HUMAN PRACTICES
Beyond and alongside the scientific project, the human practices are the long story of the project building and the questioning about its applications in society. This essential part of the project allows the production of Biosystems that fit with current society issues considering people needs in a userfriendly and safe way. If the scientific project corresponds to the lab work, then human practices is the link between the lab and the society to gather people around the beautiful world of science and biotechnologies.
""Human Practices is the study of how your work affects the world, and how the world affects your work.""
Peter Carr, Director of Judging
MEETING WITH PROFESSIONALS
In the framework of Human Practices, we initially began with meeting professionals in the research community to verify if our foundational advance project: PEPTalk was innovative and if it seemed as useful for the world of research as for the public. Here are the main professionals we interviewed.
Jérôme BONNET
Researcher at UMR 1054 INSERM in Montpellier, FRANCE.
During this interview we discussed about the potential of our project to improve co-cultures in various projects. We had the opportunity to find many applications of our project to different laboratory techniques. See the Laboratory Aspects of the Applications.
Dr. BONNET also recommended other articles from other researchers in the field of logic gates. He advised us on some details that we should consider such as the permeability of the membrane of each bacterium to the viral peptide that serves to communicate, so we checked the presence of the Opp transporter in E. coli (see the Design Overview page ).
Overall, he was quite enthusiastic about the project and testified the real usefulness of PEPTalk in research topics using biosensing systems.

Week 26
This week we had a general scientific meeting to ensure the ""scientific gaps"" in our project. We listed all the questions which rised during this meeting, at the end we made a more detailed plan for the labwork. Afterwards Janneke, Carsten, Esmee and Tania worked on the lab manuals.  On wednesday we joined the kick off meeting ""Meeting of Minds"", organised by the Ratthenau institute. Their intention was to introduce synthetic biology to politicians. Therefore, we had a meeting with the young representives of the different poltical parties of the Netherlands. During this meeting we had several presentation about synthetic biology, the ideas of the Ratthenau institute for the Meeting of Minds, explanation og iGEM for the politicians etc. It was a very nice meeting and I think it is a very interesting oppertunity for our team to do a part for Human Practice! I'm looking forward to the further progress for this part. Beside meeting the politicians, we also had a drink with the other Dutch iGEM teams again. I liked the enthausiasm very much!
Week 23
This week I had a talk with Alessandro about setting deadline, was good! From now on I’ll be more strict on deadlines guys! Beside that we discussed also the modelling plan. On Tuesday till Thursday I worken in Zeeland, at my parents place…Since I have to baby sit the dog, I finished the planning and did research for modelling. Further I made a flow diagram for modelling and on Friday I had a meeting with Christian Picioreanu and Alessandro. Together we distinguished the several different modelling parts in the total idea. The total idea for modelling is very nice, but it’ll take lots of time and needs lots of more research. Enough to do"
BIT,2018,Team:BIT-China#Background_-_-_TEXT.html," (TEAC) [12] , total oxyradical scavenge capacity (TOSC) [13] , the peroxyl scavenging capacity (PSC) [14] , the ferric reducing/antioxidant power assay (FRAP) [15] , and the DPPH free radical method [16] . Although these chemistry methods are currently widely-use, their main measurement principle                         is to characterize the reducibility of antioxidants by virous artificially synthesized                         exogenous free radical occurring redox reactions with the antioxidants. As a result, chemistry                         methods have the shortcoming of low biological relevance, their detecting conditions are almost                         different from the physiological environment of cell living in, and these assays can’t evaluate                         the effects of antioxidants in the complicated metabolic process. That means, chemical methods                         are unable tot evaluate indirect antioxidants properly. [17][18] Therefore, the authenticity of the experimental results of chemistry methods is questioned. [19] For example, USDA's Nutrient Data Laboratory (NDL) removed the USDA ORAC Database for Selected                         Foods from the NDL website in 2012, because of the poor authenticity and low credibility of the                         chemistry methods. [20]
Cell-based assays
Compared to human studies and animal models, our program has shorter cycles, lower costs and                         lower detection difficulty. Compared to chemistry methods, our project is compatible with                         complex metabolic processes in cells, and biological relevance and data reliability have been                         greatly improved. In addition, our project can also detect the indirect antioxidants that can’t                         be evaluate by chemistry methods, such as antioxidants that functions by stimulating the                         endogenous antioxidant system in cells, which have not antioxidant capacity without cells.
Cell-based methods for evaluating antioxidants are a novel field. Cell-based antioxidants                         detection methods that people have developed can be roughly divided into three types. The first                         type is the CAA assay and MTT assay developed from the traditional chemistry methods. The                         second type is the cell-based electrochemical method evolved from the traditional                         electrochemical methods. The third type is the engineered cells that we use to synthesize                         biology. The third one utilize the engineering cells transformed by synthetic biological                         methods, which can detect and evaluate the antioxidants.
CAA assay
Fig. 6 CAA assay
CAA assay [21] is cell-based assay, but it still doesn’t break through the limitations of traditional                         chemistry methods. Firstly, it still produces free radicals using artificial synthetic                         materials used in traditional chemistry methods, such as ABAP (Azo compound) which are                         criticized for cells.

Condensation domains
Elongation of the peptidyl chain is performed by the C domains, which catalyzes the condensation of the peptidyl chain bound to the upstream PCP domain and the amino acid bound to the downstream PCP domain. These domains have strong stereoselectivity and may have some specificity towards the side chain of the amino acid incorporated by the A domain of the same module, whereas little specificity has been observed towards the peptidyl chain [10].
Thioesterase domains
The TE domain catalyzes the final step of NRP synthesis. It is the TE domain that determines if the peptide is released or cyclized to form a cyclic structure. Despite, the important role of TE-domains they are the least understood in the pathway. While it is possible to predict A domain specificity, it is not possible to predict TE affinity [11]. The tyrocidine TE domain (Figure 2) shows high flexibility in the number of different substrates it will accept for cyclization.
Engineering of NRPS
With a pool of more than 500 different amino acid monomers, a peptide of only nine monomers have almost infinite possibilities of composition. Yet, to our knowledge, improvement of existing NRP drugs through genomic engineering of NRPS in vivo still remains unaccomplished. This is somewhat surprising as it has been possible to predict NRP products based on bioinformatics analysis of NRPS clusters for quite some time [11-13]. Two years ago, the iGEM team from Heidelberg tried to advance synthesis of synthetic peptides by combining modules from different NRPS to create potentially any desired peptide. In addition, they expressed an NRPS module (indC), which leads to the formation of a blue color after the NRP is released from the thioesterase module. When placed after an NRPS module, it was possible to produce tagged peptides. Such a tagging system would greatly improve the synthesis of synthetic NRPS-derived peptides, but to our knowledge, it has not been possible to repeat the experiment within the group at Heidelberg. This illustrates the complexity of NRPS engineering, despite its modularity. Crystallization and structural studies have highlighted the specific and evolutionary evolved interaction between modules as crucial for NRPS function"

EPF_Lausanne,2015,Team:EPF Lausanne#Practices_-_-_TEXT.html,". Duboule also expressed concerns about fully stopping the research because of a moratorium, as it would represent a waste of time, above all for sick people waiting for a treatment (patients suffering from cystic fibrosis for example). In addition, moratoriums are, in his opinion, not the right way to address important questions. A third opinion, supported by Oliver Peter, assesses that the debate raised by CRISPR-Cas9 does not bring anything really new to the table compared with the Asilomar moratorium: “I do not think it [a moratorium] is necessary. For me, this technology is making things more feasible, but we have already debated this. And we already decided in our society that we do not want to interfere with the human germ line. There is nothing fundamentally new that one can do with CRISPR-Cas9 as far as I understand it”.
The role of Ethics
A topic that is often mentioned in discussions about moratoriums is the position and the role of ethics in the discussion. Recently, in the shadows of the very mediatized debate around CRISPR-Cas9 and the use of genetic engineering in medicine, ethics and bioethicists in particular have been described as a barrier to progress. An example is the editorial Steven Pinker wrote for the Boston Globe: “The moral imperative for bioethics” published on August 1st 2015 [5]. We also noted a tendency for scientists to expect ethicists to give clear answers to questions like “are we allowed to continue doing such or such experiment?” which is in fact a misconception about the function of ethics in such issues. Prof. Benaroyo makes it clear: “Ethics in itself will usually not give an answer as a matter of principle, ethics is reflexive, meaning that it will ask the questions and explore the issues”. Most importantly, ethics and ethics committees are not to be confused. Ethics committees are not and must not solely consist of ethicists. All stakeholders have to be represented. Typically, for a public health issue, it would mean scientists, members of an association representing patients, ethicists, sociologists, politicians and economists. The role of ethics committees is to make assessments, after having addressed the issues in a protocolar way, but not to lead a public debate between different parties.
A few final words
It seems very difficult for us to give any definite answer to the questions we asked about communication, interaction and responsibility in Science. Therefore, we decided to describe our general feeling after having met the experts and discussed the above-mentioned topics. It"

There is also the possibility of single-crossover plasmids which do also work fine, but the vector can then easily cross-out again, so it is not stably integrated.)
Linearisation before transformation in B. subtilis
For integration ofs by double crossover, plasmids (if it is not replicative) have to be linearized before transformation. B. subtilis is naturally competent, takes up DNA fragments and integrates preferably linear fragment into its genome via double cross-over. The linearization of our plasmids can all be performed with ScaI which cuts only inside the bla gene. If that enzyme also cuts in your insert, please check for other single cutters outside of the area that is integrated into the B. subtilis genome. For the actual transformation of B. subtilis, please linearize 1-2 µg of your plasmid and then proceed with our transformation protocol .
Verification of correct integration
Transformants are plated on selective media containing the appropriate antibiotic (resistance gene in between recombination sites).  The obtained colonies then are tested for their insertion into the correct locus. Usually it is sufficient to test 4-8 colonies.
To test the insertion into the
amyE-locus: amyE codes for an α-Amylase which degrades starch. Disruption of amyE disables B. subtilis of degrading starch. Starch is usually visualized by the starch-iodine reaction with Lugol's iodine that reveals a dark blue colour.
To test your transformants, streak the obtained colonies (and the WT as control) on a replica plate (with antibiotic) and on a starch plate and incubate overnight at 37°C. The next day, pour Lugol’s iodine  on the plate so that it is covered with a thin film. Around colonies which can degrade starch (WT and wrong colonies), there should be a bright zone around the colony. Correct clones do not show this bright zone. (see also Figure 1)
Figure 1: Starch plate with B. subtilis streaked out colonies, covered with Lugol’s iodine. 3 strains can still hydrolyze starch, which can be seen by the bright surrounding area. The other clones have the insertion in the correct locus.
thrC-locus: thrC codes for the threonine synthase which performs an essential reaction for the production of the amino acid threonine. Disruption of that gene leads to threonine auxotrophy which can be tested"

Public Engagement & Collaboration
As a student of the top normal university of China, we felt obligated to contribute to the popularization and education of the advanced idea of synthetic biology and iGEM. Thus, we took advantage of the education-related resources we possessed, and did a lot of meaningful and experimental educational works. We designed a systematic four-week introductory courses with the help of professors who owned original comprehension on the methodology of teaching. We launched this course system in a series of schools, expecting to stimulate their interests in synthetic biology. As for the selecting and breeding process for the next generation of team BNU-China, we’ve developed a whole new and well-paced program. What’s more, we’ve done innovative works with the user experience improvements of our website. We created an animated figure as a desktop assistant system based on our projects and basic knowledge and information on synthetic biology and iGEM. Users can access the above information simply through natural dialogs with the cute cartoon figure. The delightful way of science propagation had proven to be well-received among various population. Lastly, we reviewed the history and experiences of our team, and we set up our own websites and printed posters to exhibit our achievements.
Introductory Courses:
In September 2017, with the hope to accumulate experiences and explore the methodology of synthetic biology propagation, we launched the systematic four-week introductory course program in xx schools as a meaningful attempt on in-depth teaching of the principles of synthetic biology towards average high school students. The course system covers the 101 introduction on synthetic biology together with some example of its application adapted according to the knowledge base of high school students and a brief lecture on iGEM and our project. To guarantee the quality of the courses, we practiced, rehearsed and revised for several rounds. To make sure that the involved school, students and their parents fully consented with the course series and were willing to participate actively, we handed out well-adapted formal consent forms(超链接到另一个页面，放知情同意书原稿), which we believe to be a fair template for future references. The courses were liked by most of the students, and there were heated discussion among the teachers and students.         "

Transcription rate in E.coli= 80bp/s [26] = 80 x 1.66x10-6mM/s = 80 x 1.66x10-6 x 60mM/min = 7.97x10-3mM/min

3. Incubate master stock primers newly suspended in water for 10 minutes.  Mix well before making working stock dilutions.
4. Create a 10 uM solution of primers as a “working solution.” This reduces the number of freeze/thaw cycles that the master primer stock goes through and reduces the chances of contaminating the primary source for the primer. Dilute the primer master stock in a sterile microcentrifuge tube 1:10 with water.
5. Store stock solutions and working solutions at -20 degrees C.
Steady State Growth and Fluorescence Measurement
Purpose: One of the ways that gene expression can be measured is by fluorescence. By measuring the intensity of a fluorescent protein, it is possible to predict the expression of a gene that is kept on the same plasmid. One of the ways that measuring fluorescence is useful in the codon optimization project is that the gene that is trying to be optimized is a green fluorescent protein (GFP). Using a TECAN, it is possible to see which variations of GFP have the most expression while keeping the concentration of cells the same for all of the variations.
Procedure:
1.  A standard 96-well microplate containing 200 µL of LB media and the desired antibiotic was inoculated from single colonies. A non-fluorescent cell culture was also inoculated. The cultures were allowed to grow overnight at 37 C at 250 rpm until an OD of 2.0 was reached.
Note: Only the inner 60 wells are used for measurement because the outer wells can have media evaporate and this would affect the results. The outer wells were filled with blank media to prevent this from happening to inner wells.
2.  A fresh 96-well transparent, flat bottom microplate wwas filled with 198 µL M9 minimal media. Microplate wells were inoculated by overnight cultures using a 1:100 dilution.
3. The new microplate was placed inside the spectrophotometer and incubated at 37 C at 250 rpm.
4. When a culture reached an OD between 0.15 and 0.20, 10-20µL samples of each culture were transferred to a fresh, transparent, flat bottom microplate containing 180-190"

Project Abstract
Our goal is to engineer a novel biosensor with a faster readout than is currently available. Many bacteria produce, secrete, and respond to chemicals called autoinducers to monitor population density and to synchronize gene expression, a process called quorum sensing. In quorum sensing based biosensors, detection of autoinducer activates transcription of a reporter gene, which must then be translated and accumulate to detectable levels, which can take two to four hours. In our system, we will use TraR, a protein used in the quorum sensing response of Agrobacterium tumefaciens, which dimerizes only in the presence of its autoinducer. We have successfully fused traR to sequence for two separate complementary fragments of GFP. Upon addition of autoinducer, we predict that already accumulated TraR-GFP fragment monomers will dimerize, allowing the GFP fragments to interact and fluoresce. This new approach may drastically reduce the time necessary for future biosensors to produce detectable output.
A new approach to Human Practices
Here we present an outline of our workshop for the benefit of other collegiate iGEM teams reaching out to high school iGEM teams. We believe that formal collaborations between college and high school represent an innovative new approach to human practices with benefits for both the high school and collegiate teams. This was an effective way for us to engender excitement about both synthetic biology in high school level students as well as for our college students to demonstrate further mastery of the field of synthetic biology in general and their research topic specifically by creating presentations and activities designed for the high school level. Visit our Human Practices page to see our idea in action
Thanks for all your help!
We received lots of help from researchers with no vested interest in our success. We especially want to thank Dr. Clay Fuqua from University of Indiana and Dr. Lynne Regan from Yale University. Check out our Attributions page for more information.

10ul of each spiked extraction was loaded on a gel and imaged with the Typhoon. Next to that also 5, 10 and 15 ng of Cy5-labeled EPO where loaded on the gel as reference. Showing that circa 5 ng of Cy5-labeled EPO was present in the 10ul of the extractions. The total extraction volume was 60ul. So circa 5*6=30 ng of Cy5-labeled EPO was present in the final extraction volumes. Showing a roughly 50% extraction efficency, since 60 ng was spiked per sample.      Whereas the difference in cfDNA measurement by using the Qubit would suggest an extraction efficiency of circa 37%. But the three spiked samples were too different from eachother in values, probably due to using a too high concentration of sample for spiking.3

Backbone amplification
The  pSB1C3  backbone was amplified, purified and quantified in preparation for Gibson  assembly  of the naringenin operon.  Amplification was performed by PCR using  Q5® High-Fidelity  DNA  Polymerase and primers pSB1C3F and pSB1C3R. The resultant PCR product  was  analysed by agarose gel electrophoresis and showed a band at 2 kb that corresponded to the size of the plasmid backbone. The backbone was then purified using  Qiagen  QIAquick  PCR Purification Kit and the  DNA concentration quantified using a Qubit fluorometer, this was determined to be 3.58 µg/ml. As this concentration was far too low for Gibson assembly, the backbone was amplified and purified again using the same techniques resulting in a brighter band at 2 kb than before (Figure 9) and a stock concentration of 26.2 µg/ml.
Protocol Details found here
Figure 9. Agarose gel showing the 2 kb band representing the amplified plasmid backbone (pSB1C3).
Positive control - Gibson assemblies
A positive control of the Gibson  assembly was conducted. The NEBuilder® HiFi DNA Assembly Cloning Kit was used. A positive control reagent  supplied with the kit contained two  overlapping dsDNA fragments and the pUC19 plasmid. The positive control was conducted to check that the assembly mix was working, the protocols for transformation were correct and that the cells  prepared  previously were  competent.
The results of the positive control showed that the E. coli DH5α  cells had successfully been made competent as they were able to take up the  three-part assembly of the two overlapping fragments and the pUC19 backbone (Figure 10A).  Furthermore, the reagents and protocols used in the Gibson assemblies were shown to have worked proving their viability for use in future experiments.  No colonies grew on the negative control plates (Figure 10B),"

The results of Chylack et. Al. relate LOCS to opacity. Opacity (%) is physically related to absorbance at 397.5 nm, and can be calculated with the following equation.
As a result, we can find the equivalent absorbance of each point on the LOCS scale, shown in Table 1 (outside collapsible).

Assumptions of Model 1
We are about to use experimental data from experiments we performed. As we cannot perfectly simulate a human cataract in our lab, we have to make the following assumptions:
Cataract damage is directly proportional to H2O2 concentration and time. Crystallin damage is mainly caused by H2O2 interacting the cysteine on crystallin. The reaction between H2O2 and cysteine is first-order (Domínguez-Vicent 2016), supporting this assumption. This allows us to make the quantification of crystallin damage.
We assume that the amount of crystallin in the lens is far greater than the amount of crystallin degraded. Therefore, a change in the amount of crystallin does not impact crystallin damage, as H2O2 only degrades a small portion of crystallin"

SBML
SBML is a language which stores and exchanges computer-based mathematical models. It is an open standard based on the XML markup language. For writing the models in SBML we used the COPASI program.
JSim
To bridge the gap between agent based models (Java) and cellular models (SBML), the Newcastle team are using a software product called JSim, developed by the University of Washington.
Models developed
The following are models which we have developed using SBML:
