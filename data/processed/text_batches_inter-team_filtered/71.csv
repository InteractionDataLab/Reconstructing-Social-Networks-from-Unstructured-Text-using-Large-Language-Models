Stockholm,2018,Team:Stockholm#Applied Design_-_-_TEXT.html," 55 kDa in size and improved for degrading SMX, differs from the wild-type laccase by three amino acids. The bulky, volatile Phe162, Phe332 and Phe337 amino acids were replaced by isoleucine residues. These modifications were suggested by the results of rational design analysis. The core of the beads, which is approximately 200 nm in size, consists of magnetite (Fe3O4) giving ferromagnetic properties to the final product. The recovery from the water and re-use of Biotic Blue is based on these magnetic properties, as it is illustrated in Figure 4.
Figure 4. The immobilization process of mutant enzymes on the magnetic bead.
The magnetite core is coated by a layer of polystyrene sulfonate (PSS) which in turn is covered by Chitosan (Chi). PSS is an ionomer and mediates the adherence of Chi to the magnetic core since Chi cannot be adsorbed or form covalent bonds directly with the magnetite. Chi, a polysaccharide, offers a suitable surface to the bead for covalent bond formation. Although part of the Chi surface may be covered by adsorbed or covalently bound enzymes, the largest surface area is covered by Glutaraldehyde (GA), an agent used for the cross-linking of the enzymes. Cross-linking increases the capacity of each bead in regard to the number of enzymes it can bear, vastly improving its efficiency. Macroscopically, Biotic Blue has the form of a black powder and can be effortlessly discerned from clean water. The powder form enables uncomplicated integration of Biotic Blue in every wastewater treatment process system and makes its operation fairly handy. As Christian Baresel voiced: “Every plant is unique, thus, it is important to have a tailor-made solution for each one. The treatment technology is based on dosing, motion, etc., and therefore the tailor-made solution makes the most impact. For example, some hospitals have infection departments, and some do not, which requires different treatment of the waste” (Personal Communication C Baresel 20 Jun 2018).
... in the wastewater treatment process
The implementation site of Biotic Blue is the WWTP. Although the wastewater treatment process is not the same in every WWTP, in general, three stages can be distinguished: the mechanical, the biological and the chemical as it is illustrated in Figure 5. After considering all the feedback we received from experts in the field of wastewater treatment management, we decided that the point of implementation of Biotic Blue"

Toronto,2016,Team:Toronto#HP-Impact_-_-_TEXT.html," in the two special issues, which featured articles on projects done in the previous year, raises this figure to 2.18 years. This implies that removing teams and papers from the last two years provides a better picture of iGEM team publication rates, with the caveat that the Jamboree occurs very late in the calendar year and any paper published more than two months later is coded as being published one year later. Nonetheless, 72.73% of research articles and other writings were published two or more years after the Jamboree.
There are two other reasons why we believe it is appropriate to remove the most recent two years from the analysis. First, the graphics above show that research articles and other writing fell to two from the 2014 Jamboree and zero from the 2015 Jamboree so far. The second is how the results from a similar exercise performed by Porcar and Vilanova (2013) holds up after two years.
Porcar and Vilanova’s set of recommendations for iGEM included an observation that relatively few academic papers result from iGEM projects which was intended to emphasize the primarily pedagogical purpose of the competition. We agree with this interpretation of iGEM’s purpose and our own evidence shows that only .06 papers result from each project. However, their assertion that “to the best of [their] knowledge, fewer than half of the finalist projects have been published so far,” (Porcar and Vilanova, 2014) supported by their own review of finalist projects 2006-13 is false. Since 2014, seven articles by Groningen 2012, Paris Bettencourt 2013 (twice), Slovenia 2012, Heidelberg 2013, Munich 2013, and Imperial 2013 (Daszczuk et al., 2014, Atanaskovic et al., 2014, Libis et al., 2014, Lebar et al., 2014, Beer et al., 2014, Morath et al., 2014, Kelwick et al., 2015) have been published. All seven papers were published by teams in the two years before Porcar and Vilanova published their article. This is in addition to two articles by Slovenia 2006 and Peking 2010 (Ciglič et al., 2007, Zhang et al., 2013) that were published before 2014 but were missed by their review. The seven articles later published that were based on work from the two previous Jamborees show that"

After a successful test reaction at 10uL, we repeated our linearization PCR with a volume of 50uL. Our confirmation gel indicated a successful linearization, although some of the sample streaked above the 10 kb ladder.
We then attempted a transformation of our new chemicompetent Y. lipolytica using our control D17 plasmid. Our transformant cells were then incubated in liquid selective media for outgrowth. We also attempted a transformation of our linearized PCR product from the 50 uL reaction, but later realized that the linearized plasmid was unfit for expression of any genes at this point and so the transformation plate was discarded.
Created YNB+CSM-Leu medium (leucine-deficient) and YNBcasa (uracil-deficient) medium. Attempted to transform Y. lipolytica with pXRL2, ultimately to test if we can miniprep yeast with our protocol. Unfortunately there was no obvious yeast growth on the transformation plates.

Thesis week is upon us! This time around, we struggled a lot less to work as a group and write as a group. The early organization probably helped. We turned in a much more cohesive paper.
We received an invitation to speak at TEDx! This is exciting. We get to tell people about our project, but we also get to bring more attention to the unmet need for modern contraceptives! Our team is really happy about the opportunity to present on such a large platform.
In lab, we had some successful yeast and bacteria transformations, some successful Gibsons, and confirmed Y. lipolytica’s antibiotic resistance.
We also finally received IRB exemption for our questionnaires! This means we can now officially use our questionnaires to gather information about the women who may not have adequate access to modern contraceptives.
After outgrowth in liquid selective media, our cultures repeatedly failed to show colonies when plated on selective media. In order to address this, we redid our protocol for making chemicompetent Y. lipolytica cells after performing a final plating with the last of our transformant cell stock. We also performed transformations to reamplify our D17 plasmid in anticipation"

Tool Overview
Clotho is a software platform for synthetic biologists. Clotho is a nexus. Clotho is the foundation for the automated future of biological engineering. All of these feats are accomplished without Clotho doing anything itself.  At its core, Clotho is a data model and a plugin infrastructure. In other words, Clotho gives a vocabulary to describe biological objects and a way for many different types of tools to interact with these biological objects. By itself, Clotho is not a tool. However, the plugin infrastructure allows Clotho to be a rallying points for all sorts of different tools, each fulfilling the exact need of the user. Clotho is highly adaptable, and will rise to meet the diverse challenges that will need to be met in synthetic biology.
This summer we built a large variety of tools. We built a tool that designed re-configurable plasmids for studying tuberculosis. We created a software suite for performing automated software assembly. We also made a primer designing tool ,Genbank parsing tool, a tool for viewing sequence annotations . And we redesigned the interface to make Clotho easier to use and more effective as a tool for researchers. All of these tools can interact seamlessly with the same data. Clotho is the converging point for the tools we have made at Boston University, as well as those being developed at Johns Hopkins University, UC Berkeley, and tools we have not even dreamed up yet.
Each of these tools are designed to make it easier for scientists to manage their data and generate results.  There will be no more spreadsheets, no more copy and pasting sequences in a text editor.  You can simulate pcr amplification, simulate insertion into a vector backbone, and then annotate that plasmid, all with the same software tool, without having to open half a dozen windows. Drag a part and drop it according to your intuition. This summer at Boston University we built software tools"

No começo do curso, por exemplo, era muito comum ouvir que ao longo do curso as mulheres tornam-se machos. Acho que esse é um comentário que não tem intenção de ser preconceituoso, mas é feito de forma inconsciente. Acho que em nosso cenário, o preconceito é mais sutil; muitas vezes as pessoas fazem esse tipo de comentário sem pensar e refletir. Reconheço que esse cenário não vale para todas as situações... Há muito preconceito que é praticado de forma escancarada. Mas, no IFSC/USP, por exemplo, o preconceito é mais sutil.
Would you say there is any kind of gender segregation or discrimination, even if it is subtle? If yes, would you say happens unconsciously?
We live in a very prestigious surrounding, because people have a good education. In general we do not face prejudice. Not directly. I see that sometimes there are some prejudiced comments that happens unconsciously. At the beginning of my course, for example, it was very common to hear that women would become manlier over the course. I do not think this is a comment that intends to be prejudiced, but it was done unconsciously. I think in our institution, the prejudice is more subtle. Often people say it without thinking. I understand this situation is not always valid… There is a lot of prejudice that is done openly. But, at IFSC/USP, for example, it is more subtle. Uma carreira acadêmica, contando com graduação, mestrado e doutorado, muitas vezes passa a se estabilizar apenas aos 30 anos. Como você vê o impacto disso, no seu caso? É diferente, dependendo do gênero? No sentido de finalizar a carreira acadêmica, não há muita diferença entre os gêneros. Ambos terminam na faixa dos trinta anos.

Entrepreneurship
Best Supporting Entrepreneurship Special Prize
In previous years, iGEM had an entrepreneurship track. Teams were encouraged to build projects and focus around commercializing their work. We have now moved to an award as the best work in this area may come from teams who are not solely focused on entrepreneurship.
The Best Supporting Entrepreneurship award recognizes exceptional effort to build a business case and commercialize an iGEM project. This award is open to all teams to show that entrepreneurship is something all teams can aspire to do with their project. This award can go to an new project, or to a previous project that a team aimed to commercialize. Have you filed a provisional patent on your project/device/process? Have you raised money to build and ship products? Have you pitched your idea to investors and received money? As always in iGEM, the aim is to impress the judges!
To compete for the Best Supporting Entrepreneurship prize , please describe your work on this page and also fill out the description on the judging form .
You must also delete the message box on the top of this page to be eligible for this prize.
Inspiration
You can look at what other teams did to get some inspiration!
Here are a few examples:
2016 Sydney Australia
2016 Pasteur Paris
2014 UCC Ireland
2014 Imperial College London
Patents and intellectual property
If your team is seriously considering commercializing and looking into building a company after the competition, you may want to look at how you are going to protect your work and secure investment. Investors will usually require some form of intellectual protection, so you may want to investigate how to apply for a patent or provisional patent in your country and region before disclosing your project at iGEM. Remember that you can only be evaluated in iGEM based on what you share on your wiki and at the Jamboree, so any work you don't present can't count towards your project.
This is an area where we are different as we care about sharing, openness and contributing to the community and investors don't always agree with these"

Description of Customer Segments
After the market survey, we found that Taiwan is very concerned about children’s oral health. When we actually inquired of parents, they told us sometimes children are afraid to see a doctor, so they do not go to the dentist until they cannot stand the pain, which might be too late. Additionally, they also told us both parents and schools are conducting three-month dental examinations for cavities.
However, the dentist can help the school do the dental checkup only every half year or year, so the primary schools we interviewed responded that they are very interested in our product and willing to do business with us in the future. For example, they can use our products every three months as an initial inspection to identify those students who have cavities. After that, they will inform parents to take their kids to see the dentist, knowing the children's oral condition in advance.
According to this result, we have interviewed those primary schools"

Jennifer Baltzegar
Jen is an IGERT fellow and a Ph.D. student in Genetics, with a minor in Genetic Engineering and Society.
Project Focus: She has helped to write sections for different principles as well as developed the wiki and populated the Environmental Health portion of the concept map.
Academic Focus: Jen is broadly interested in studying the differences between populations and species via mechanisms of evolution and impacts of population change, and she is particularly interested in studying the impacts of genetic engineering in agricultural pest species.
Downtime Focus: She enjoys running, camping, playing with her dog, and renovating her house.
Johanna Elsensohn
Johanna is an IGERT fellow and a Ph.D. student in Entomology, with a minor in Genetic Engineering and Society.
Project focus: A bit of everything. She helped write sections for several of the core principles. She also helped design the concept map and helped put the poster together.
Academic focus: Johanna studies the ecology and behavior of agricultural pests in order to develop control solutions within an Integrated Pest Management framework. Genetic pest management has the potential to be an effective tool in IPM. However, the appropriateness of the new technology needs to address social and cultural concerns in addition to overcoming technological barriers. She joined the iGEM team because she's interested in studying the social, ethical, and legal issues that surround the release of new technology.
Downtime focus: When not chained to the computer or in the field, Johanna can be found either in the mountains exploring new places with her dog, out on the water kayaking, or in the kitchen concocting something delicious!

Our project wants to improve the quality of water and to do so, we focused on one of the biggest the sources of water pollution: domestic sewage. The effluent treatment is different in every place, so we wanted to know how the Waste Water Treatment Plant (WWTP) works in our city, Lorena.
Our team went to the WWTP, operated by the Basic Sanitation Company of the State of São Paulo (SABESP), to learn more about it. Coincidentally, this plant is not far from our University campus. You can see how this visit went on the video bellow:
Your browser does not support the video tag.
The city’s WWTP covers an area of 52,000m², with installed capacity of 568 l / s, currently operating at 290 L / s. The sewage treatment is done with four lagoons: two with anaerobic bacteria and two with facultative bacteria. Lorena’s WWTP is inspired in an Australian wastewater plant and this plant can handle quiet good Lorena sewage.
All the treated effluent is released into the “Paraíba do Sul” river, that it is a very important river in this region of São Paulo. A good information we received is that the water released has a better quality than the water of Paraíba river, so the treated effluent is helping on the cleaning of the river.
More than just visit, we obtained some data on the operation of the WWTP, information we used on our Scale-up modeling. Also, we gained a concern involving the legislation of WWT in Brazil and used that to improve the Application of our project.
To gain different perspectives of the sewage treatment in other locations, we also did a great collaboration with the Stockholm iGEM Team , receiving information of WWTPs in Sweden.
Waste Water Treatment Plant in Lorena - SP (BR)
Our next step was the public awareness. We wanted to see if the local population was aware of how the sewage in their city was treated. So, we went to Lorena’s main square “Arnolfo de Azevedo” to interview people on what they know about the WWT and see if that is a public concern. This is the overall profile of the people we interviewed:
From the questions we made, we got some interesting data. As it can be seen in the statistics bellow, most people find very important the wastewater treatment (both for consumption and for environmental release). However, most people don’t know how is the WWT in the"

Figure 8: Fed-batch fermentation
As mentioned above, the fed-batch facilitate high yield of dry cells. The experimental data from the research  paper showed that a concentration of 75 [g dry cells/L] was reached after 27 [h]. This was deemed an   appropriate level to start induction. The results also showed that substrate was fed in a rate, where   glucose did not accumulate in the broth, and furthermore that the levels of acetate after an initial rise was non-  existent in the end of the fed-batch phase, see figure 5: Batch fermentation. The composition of   the fermentation broth before induction can be viewed in table 6. Reference: L. Yee and H. W. Blanch.

SDU-Denmark,2015,Team:SDU-Denmark#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," Danish and a Nordic Meetup.  The Danish Meetup was hosted by the DTU iGEM Team. This meetup took place the 24th to the 26th of april, where all of the other danish teams participated. The core of this meetup was a biobrick workshop, which took place in the DTU laboratory. This workshop was meant as an introduction for how to build a biobrick. A lot of the team members do nott have much experience with wet lab before iGEM, so this was also a general “how to”-guide for wet lab.  But the meetup also consisted of lectures about ‘How to do - Wiki’ and some cosy social games and a dinner.
The Nordic Jamboree was hosted by the Uppsala iGEM team in collaboration with the Stockholm iGEM Team. This took place at University of Uppsala from the 24th to the 26th of July and a lot of the nordic iGEM teams participated in this event. The main event of this meetup was the Nordic iGEM Jamboree competition, which was held on the 25th. The competition was meant as a chance to practise for the Giant Jamboree in Boston. The winning team of the Nordic Jamboree would receive The Golden Pipette. Other than this the event consisted of workshops, social events, and a dinner saturday evening with a following barcrawl.
After the Nordic Jamboree we were contacted by the Uppsala iGEM team. They needed help to find information on how many teams that had been using antibodies in their projects. This turned out to be a win-win situation, since we could use the data in our Business Plan ). We also helped the 2015 iGEM team from d'Aix Marseille Université by spreading their survey about chewing gum. We earned a silver medal for our efforts.

Wait for the wafer to cool down.
Check the final image of the photoresist. The final image usually has a lot of defects at the edges of the channels. And due to the low transmittance of SU-8 photoresist to the low-wavelength light, the photoresist at the top side of the channel will absorb higher energy than the photoresist at the bottom, causing a trapezoidal cross section profile.

The third scale is that of the product: the biological compound the cell factory is used to produce. Certain products may be unstable, and dropping the temperature can inhibit their rate of degradation by simple thermodynamics. If the product is actively degraded, there is also a chance the decrease in temperature slows down the enzymes that would achieve this. Note that if the product is an enzyme rather than a metabolite, as is the case with many cell factories, thermodynamic degradation won't play much of a role, but inhibiting the proteases that would break them down is all the more valuable.
Biofuel Production
Biofuels are expensive. According to the U.S. Department of Energy's Aquatic Species Program, biodiesel production costs are projected to be at least twice as high as the price of ordinary petroleum diesel, even with very aggressive assumptions about bioproductivity [1 ]. Currently, over 90% of commercial algae biomass production is done with large-scale open pond systems. There are no feasible alternatives to this setup, because of the high pressure on cost efficiency. Unfortunately, such systems usually suffer from low production rates during the cold season [1] [2] . Heating the ponds is not an option either, because the energy required for this would cost more than the gained yield brings in.
Following the publication that cyanobacterial strains isolated from high latitudes often remain active at low temperatures [3] , Hong et al. (2010) identified the opportunity for cold-resistant cyanobacteria to enhance the efficiency of biofuel synthesis. [4] If our CryoBricks can be expressed in species other than E. coli, our project might be a humble first step down this road Hong et al. point towards.
Selection
An antibiotic is a compound or substance that slows down growth or kills bacteria. Bacteria can gain resistance for antibiotics by natural selection; if one micro-organism gains this ability it can share this ability through horizontal gene transfer. Although antibiotic resistance is very dangerous for human health and preventing the spread of antibiotics is top priority in hospitals and other medical facilities, selection of bacteria on antibiotic resistance is an essential tool in research.
When genes are introduced in bacteria, a plasmid is inserted into the bacteria containing the gene of interest along with a gene that grants antibiotic resistance. By adding antibiotics to the medium or plate, only bacteria that posess the resistance and your gene of interest can grow.
Our bricks will allow bacteria to grow in a cold environment. If the antibiotic resistance gene is replaced by one"

Bielefeld-CeBiTec,2014,Team:Bielefeld-CeBiTec#Results#rMFC#ElectronTransfer_-_-_TEXT.html," BBa_K1172507 ) provided by the iGEM Team Bielefeld-Germany 2013 . Crossing the periplasmatic space, the mediator adsorb at the inner membrane of the E. coli cell. The mediator functions as an electron donor for the over expressed fumarate reductase. In this step succinate is produced in the cytoplasm. Reduction of fumarate into succinate creates a loop into the citric acid cycle, because succinate would be reoxidized again by the succiante dehydrogenase. Succinate excretion is avoid, because of the knockout of the C4 carboxylate transporter DcuB. In the reaction of succinate dehydrogenase electrons are transferred to FAD+ generating FADH2, which enter the electron transport chain. The electron transport facilitates proton translocation over the inner bacterial membrane. The proton motoric force is used by ATP synthase. Generated ATP and reductive power in the bacterial cell leads to an increasing metabolic activity.
E. coli KRX ΔdcuB::oprF strain
We investigated the effect of the C4 carboxylate transporter DcuB knockout on E. coli KRX. Furthermore we showed the integration of the outer membrane porine OprF ( BBa_K1172507 ) into the bacterial genome by replacing the gene of E. coli C4 carboxylate antiporter DcuB. So we did knockout and insertion in a one-step process.  The successful knockout of the DcuB antiporter and simultaneous insertion of BBa_K1172507 was shown with PCR analysis, DNA sequencing and phenotypic investigation via Biolog analysis and anaerobic cultivation in M9 minimal media with fumarate supplemented. Substrates and products were analyzed by HPLC.  The electrobiochemical behavior of E. coli KRX with knocked out C4 carboxylate antiporter DcuB was tested in a H-cell reactor .
Preparation of knockout deletion cassette
We decide to knock out the C4 carboxylate transporter DcuB to prevent succinate export. Besides we inserted the outer membrane porines OprF ( BBa_K1172507 ) into the genome.

Potsdam_Bioware,2011,Team:Potsdam Bioware#Safety Ethics_-_-_TEXT.html," for the environment. This means that only a negligible risk arises from our used methods and constructs to the environment, the public and the team members. Last but not least, we do not see any particular danger of abuse or other security threat of our work, since it is specifically addresses scientific questions. It is our goal that the health of mankind and the environment benefit from our research.
Safety Questions
Would any of your project ideas raise safety issues in terms of: researcher safety, public safety, or environmental safety?
No, our project is not raising any of these safety issues.
Do any of the new BioBrick parts (or devices) that you made this year raise any safety issues? If yes, did you document these issues in the Registry? How did you manage to handle the safety issue? How could other teams learn from your experience?
No, our BioBrick parts or devices are not going to raise any safety issues.
Is there a local biosafety group, committee, or review board at your institution? If yes, what does your local biosafety group think about your project? If no, which specific biosafety rules or guidelines do you have to consider in your country?
In Germany, work with genetically modified organisms is regulated by the ‘Law on Gene Technology’ (Gesetz zur Regelung der Gentechnik, GenTG). According to these rules, the responsible governmental authorities of the state of Brandenburg have been notified about our work. Our work was classified as biosafety level 1.
Do you have any other ideas how to deal with safety issues that could be useful for future iGEM competitions? How could parts, devices and systems be made even safer through biosafety engineering?
So far biosafety assessment is primarily based on the characterization of wild-type devices or systems. For synthetic biology these rules should be extended to better represent the variations made by synthetic biology approaches. In addition to the continuous evaluation of safety and security, a section on technological impact assessment should be added.

PP still had its color at 45 °C after a minute it was raised to 50 °C and it began to lose its color. The chromoproteins were then rehydrated with 1 ul of miiliQ water and they gained their color back. This test shows a reversible color change that is seen at a relatively low temperature. Interestingly CP did not change to purple and then lose its color like we say in cell lysate testing.
Before Heat
Here are the chromoproteins before heat is added. Order from top to bottom: CP, PP, TP, VP.

Here are the chromoproteins after they lost their color and before they were rehydrated. Same order as above.
After Rehydration
Here are the chromoproteins after they have been rehydrated with 1 ul of water. They have gained their color back. Same order as above. These were then put back into heat.
After heat 2nd time
Here are the chromoproteins after the second heating where PP lost its color at 50 degrees C and CP, TP, and VP lost their color between 40 an 45 degrees. Same order as above.

S. enterica serovar Typhimurium SPI-2 region. A map of the S. enterica serovar Typhimurium SPI-2 region is depicted [9] .
Fig.4
To confirm the presence of SPI-2 region in the strain send from SGSC  colony-PCR analysis was performed using a primer set which targets a 481 bp region inside of SPI2. [M: λHindIII marker, C: negative control colony of E.coli(DH5α), S: sample colony of E.coli send from SGSC]
   Here we show the map of SPI-2 region (Fig.3). The length of SPI-2 region about 40kb and T3 secretion apparatus is a complex consisted of more than 20 kinds of proteins. As mentioned before cloned SPI-2 on R995 vector was functional in E. coli (K-12) [9] . And also it was reported that SPI-2 region cloned on pBeloBAC11 (BAC=Bacteria Artificial Chromosome) is functional [4] . So, we decided to request a E. coli (K-12) strain carrying a pBeloBAC11 vector encoding a genome fragment of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium LT2 which covers the SPI-2 region [B_STM07H21  SGSC4024  1464540～1562427] from Salmonella Genetic Stock Center(SGSC) in University of Calgary, Canada ( http://people.ucalgary.ca/~kesander/index.html ). We confirmed the presence of the cloned SPI-2 region in this strain via PCR analysis(Fig.4) shall refer to it as ""pBAC-SPI-2"" from now on. Because of the provision of MTA, we cannot register this strain as a Bio Brick, but you can also get the same strain from SGSC.

Trinity - towards an engineered co-culture toolbox
Abtract
Co-cultures are found in all conceivable entities, such as the human gut, cheese or plants, but good tools to study those communities are currently not given. Indeed we created a modularly built toolbox using not only three different dependencies but also three different organisms: With Escherichia coli, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Synechococcus elongatus our team engineered a system based on nutrient exchange. Here phosphate is provided through oxidation of phosphite, nitrogen source produced by melamine breakdown, whilst carbon source is provided by Synechococcus elongatus. Two additional independent approaches are designed, too. The first includes regulation via cross-feeding by amino acid auxotrophies and production: lysine by Escherichia coli and leucine by Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The other utilizes regulated self-lysis via quorum sensing molecules, to control cell density by a phage lysis gene. This engineered toolbox opens a wide range of possibilities to create microbial communities for different purposes, such as synthetic probiotics.

PcelA and PcomFA promoters have high specificity to σx for activation, so genes downstream the promoters will be translated only if σx is present. Hence, by using fluorescence protein as a reporting mechanism, this σx, PcelA and PcomFA promoters system could be further utilized as a specific reporter device in E. coli DH10B strain that could be used by iGEM communities.
σx-ComW mechanism
Figure 2. σx - comW Interaction Diagram
σx and ComW protein are both produced by a constitutive promoter BBa_J23100 , which continuously expresses σx required for PcelA and PcomFA promoters induction, and ComW protein is required for σx stabilization. ComW protein acts as a barrier that protects σx from being degraded by ClpXP degradation enzyme, hence it increases the production of σx. The increase in σx production will increase the expression of green fluorescence protein by PcelA and PcomFA promoters.
To complete the story of competence regulation mechanism from S. pneumoniae, we would also like to integrate another positive factor involved in competence regulation which was later found out to be ComW. Prof. Morrison's lab released another research paper on the identification of a new component in the regulation of genetic transformation in S. pneumoniae. The gene comW (SP0018) was found to be       regulated by the quorum-sensing system and is required for a high-level of competence (Luo, Li, and Morrison, 2004). Coexpression of ComW with σx restores the accumulation of σx and the expression of late genes as ComW contributes to the stabilization of the alternative sigma factor X against proteolysis by ClpXP and is required for full activity of σx in directing transcription of late competence genes (Piotrowski, Luo, and Morrison, 2009).
Based on these findings, we tried to integrate this ComW into the mechanism to see whether and how the presence of ComW affects σx. First, we cloned out the comX gene expressing σx and comW genes from the genomic DNA of S. pneumoniae NCTC 7465 strain. We then used BBa_K880005 (consisting of constitutive promoter BBa_J23100 and strong RBS BBa_B0034 ) from the BioBricks to express those genes.

For the design of this system, the E. coli ssRA tag 10 , has been used.
Testing With Different Concentrations of Vitamin B12 And Guanine
The designed construct was grown overnight in LB medium with different concentrations of guanine and vitamin B12. The concentration range of vitamin B12 was based on the concentrations normally used for testing bacteria that are used to determine the amount of vitamin B12 in human blood. The concentration range of guanine to test the guanine riboswitch construct were based on the concentrations used in previous experiments with guanine riboswitches from B. Subtilis The amount of mRFP has been measured every five minutes. Figure 2 and 3 show the mRFP over OD as from five hours of growth for the vitamin B12 and for the guanine riboswitch, respectively.
Figure 2. Expressed mRFP over OD after five hours of growth.

The expression experiment shows that gene expression is induced based on different concentrations of vitamin B12 and guanine allowing E. coli to sense the presence of V. destructor .    In addition, as a part of our collaboration with Groningen , they tested our construct in their lab as well. Their results are comparable to our vitamin B12 results. However, this is not the case for the guanine construct.
Population Dynamics
Modifying Population Dynamics to Improve Toxin Production
In our quest to save the honey bees from Varroa destructor we wanted to create a product that takes into account the hobbyist character of beekeepers.Therefore, application of BeeT should not be time consuming or require any additional expertise from beekeepers.
Our modified Bacillus thuringiensis Cry toxin ensures a high level of specificity. When activated and concentrated near the surface of cell membranes, Cry toxins form pores in the membrane, lysing the cell as a result 1 . Constitutive overexpression of such toxins in Escherichia coli is known to inhibit growth leading to cell death 2 . The aim behind the population dynamics subproject is to provide a regulatory system for toxin production that does not impair bacterial growth and survival. To this end, we propose a regulatory system that enables E. coli to express recombinant"

Multi-signal system
Design of the system
Of course, recording one changing signal in only two time periods is not enough for us to solve real-world problems. As a result, we have further designed multi-signal system based on two-signal system, which records one changing signal in more than two time periods.
Overview of the whole circuit
Like two-signal system, multi-signal system is composed of three parts, logic gates, sequential memory structures and basic orthogonal memory modules(Fig.1). The main difference between two systems is the sequential memory structures. Due to the diversity and orthogonality of serine integrases, much more orthogonal integrases used in sequential memory structures and basic orthogonal memory modules can be involved in this extending system.
Figure 1 | The overview of the Multi-signal system circuit design. Each integrase and its related attB/P sites are shown in the same color. TF, Transcriptional facters; Int, Integrases; C, Clock; T, Target.
Sequential memory structures
Fig.2 shows the sequential memory structures of multi-signal system(three-signal system). Not mentioned before, attB/P sites of integrases have core sequences. By mutating these sequences, orthogonal sites of one integrase can be made, which means that one integrase may control inversion of two sites, and that there can be little cross-talk. It helps to design this part, which has shown in the same color but in different shape. Other features of this circuit is similar to the two-signal system. It can be extended just by copying and pasting the design, involving more orthogonal integrases.

After the analysis of this gel we decided on discarding SpeC (due to the fact that we prepared a new liquid culture with LB + 1/2 Cm + PolyAs).
AhpCp1, J23119 and AtoC were ligated with PaC and transformed into competent DH5α cells and seeded on LB + Cm.
As until now we didn’t manage to make transformed DH5α loose the pCas9-SpeC plasmid, we decided on following a new strategy: prepare an overnight culture of the transformed DH5α cells into LB + Kn at 41ºC.
In order to check that DH5α hasn’t got resistance to Cm per se, we prepared two overnight cultures, one with LB and the other with LB +Cm.
27/08/2016
Colony PCR of the promoters AtoC, J23119 and AhpCp1 were performed. 4 colonies were taken from each Petri dish and 2 of them were selected from the result of the gel.
XbaI digestion of the overnight culture of pCas9-SpeC growth in LB + 1/2 Cm + Polyamines was also loaded into the electrophoresis gel.
KatG and PatA minipreps gone missing. We prepared again overnight cultures taking colonies from the Petri dishes to repeat minipreps the next day.
K2M were seeded on Petri dishes with Kn after an overnight culture at 41ºC in order to see if they had finally lost the pCas9 plasmid.
28/08/2016

In Mozambique, 6,000 people, mostly civilians, have been killed or maimed by landmines since 1980. Landmine Monitor reports have estimated that annually, 5,000 to 7,000 new casualties are caused by landmines and unexploded ordnance, the majority occurs in countries no longer involved in conflict. A child could die just for running after ball.
To conclude with; taking action to produce protein has some benefits and working with oxygen insensitive nitroreductase also has an advantage. We try to what scientists do.  (Save the people, save the world!) )

INSA-Lyon,2016,Team:INSA-Lyon#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," good, with the same warnings than for thrombin.
Important remark: We only have one aptamer to catch the Reverse-Transcriptase. Although our detection procedure requires two aptamers,                                     and the sensitivity of the method will be limited by the worst Kd between the two aptamers.
Then, we tried to do the same with 3 known aptamers against the HBV’s surface antigen (HBsAg).
Fig 7.
The sensitivity was worse than in the previous EMSAs with the thrombin and the RT. We chose the two best for our detection, but we hope to improve them to get a better sensitivity.
Things that did not work as expected...
Constructing a part with biobricks by ligation. This often failed. We tested conventional ligation, SLIC… We finally needed to order synthesized sequences. Testing the device on paper. This could not be achieved because we did not receive the required paper sheets on time.

Algorithm
In order to recommend the relevant biobricks, some advanced algorithms and classical methods are employed in the software. These algorithms and methods include Collaborative Filtering and Association Rules.
 
1.Collaborative Filtering
 
Collaborative  Filtering recommendation has become a very popular system in message filter and  information system. Different from traditional filters that analyze the content  directly, Collaborative Filtering analyzes the habits of users and find the similar  users for a given user. By dealing with the information of similar users, Collaborative  Filtering will predict the users’ interest and recommend the relevant  information.
 
Compared  with traditional text filtering, the advantages of Collaborative Filtering are  as follows: First it can filter the information that the machine is hard to  analysis based on the text. Second it based on the concept which hard to  express.
 
Collaborative  Filtering can be divided into two kinds, item-based CF and user-based CF, which  will be introduced as follows.
1.1 item-based CF
The  main idea of Item-based CF is that for a given biobrick, the algorithm finds  similar biobricks to recommend according to the similarity between two  biobricks.
In  our software, we use Hamming distance to measure the similarity of two  biobricks. Hamming distance is named by Richard Wesley Hamming, which was first  used in basic thesis about error detection and correction code. Today, hamming distance  analysis is widely used in many areas including information theory coding  theory, cryptography, etc.
The  Hamming distance of two equal-length character strings is the number of  different character in their correspondence position. In other words, it is the  number of change that changing one alphabetic string to another. For example,  the Hamming distance of 1011101and 1001001 is two.
In  our software, we calculate the hamming distance of each paired biobrick  sequence and use it as the similarity of these sequences.
1.2 User-based CF
The  main idea of User-based CF is to find similar users by analyzing the previous  behavior of different users and recommend"
Dundee,2015,Team:Dundee#Lab Book#FluID_-_-_TEXT.html," to determine if the reason for the failed transformation was an improperly digested OBP2A. This gel indicates that the restricted product hasn't been lost as the OBP2A gene fragment can be seen as a distinct band at 500 bp. A re-ligation of OBP2A into the pSB1C3 backbone will now occur.

Figure 4: Presequence Digest of pSB1C3-OBP2A. All seven plasmid purifications of the overnight cultures done on the 26/6 were digested to see if they contained the OBP2A insert. It is clear from the gel that all but sample 3 contain the insert for OBP2A as they all have faint bands at 500 bp's which corresponds to the size of OBP2A. It also appears that sample 5 contains the highest concentration, so that will be the sample that is sent for sequencing.

Figure 5: Presequence digest of pUT18-OBP2A To determine if any samples contain the OBP2A insert. It can be seen from this gel that of the  5 samples that were digested only two are show to have the OBP2A insert, therefore sample 2 will be sent for sequencing.

Figure 6: Amplification of OBP2A for insertion into pT25 vector . This is the PCR product from the amplification of OBP2A for cloning into pT25. The gel indicates OBP2A has been amplified successfully since the observed band corresponds to the expected size of 100 bp.

Figure 7: Presequence Digest of pT25-OBP2A In order to determine if any of the samples contain the OBP2A insert. It can be seen from this gel that samples 5, 6 and 7 may have inserts in them as they each have two distinct bands, one of which corresponds to the 100 bp size for the OBP2A for pT25. As a result all three samples will be sent for sequencing.

""jeu à débattre"" with the association ""arbre des connaissances""
On Thursday June 16th, the iGEM Pasteur team went to attend a ""Jeu à débattre"" that was hosted by the association, ""arbre des connaissances"". This is a debate practice or round table where several synthetic biology processes are made available to a few villages, and the inhabitants have to decide for the pros and cons of acquiring them, considering environmental, economical, and health benefits. Our role was to advise the players during the game, and then to have a little debate about synthetic biology and the ethical and moral questions it raises. We also addressed the “legal” aspect as viewed from the point of view of French and US Law.

Science Day Exhibition
April, at Seoul National Science Museum
For two continuous days, we ran a booth in ‘Family Science Day Exhibition’ hosted by Seoul National Science Museum. Since the museum was mainly for young children, we prepared activities for them and the parents. First of all, we brought many jellies and helped them make ‘sweet DNA' models. During the activity, the kids could learn the structure of DNA molecules and its basic properties. While the children making the sweet DNAs, we explained about synthetic biology and it principles using posters that we made and GFP samples to the parents. Besides, we made some other booth organizers or adults to play the “BioBrick Puzzle” which Team UT Tokyo made in 2012. Since it was also a software project, we could learn which features are needed when constructing a software.
iGEM Korean Team Meetup
August, hosted by Team Ellan Vital Korea
We joined the “iGEM Korean Team Meetup” which took place on 15th of August. Our team not only introduced our project 'Gil', but also support and mentor Korean High School iGEM teams participating the Giant Jamboree this year. By helping Ellan Vital Korea organize the meeting, we shared our experiences about Jamboree and research. It was a great time to share an opinion about each project. As they gave us feedback on our program as well, we were able to improve the ‘Gil’ to be more user-friendly.
Lecture on the ‘Gil’ and Synthetic Biology
September, at Korea University
Our aim does not stop in just informing people about synthetic biology and ‘Gil’. We tried to give realistic help to people who have a deep interest in Biology. So we gave lectures to undergraduate students of Korea University. Through this, we advertised iGEM and introduced our software program ‘Gil’. By letting them use our program, we made them grow their interest in the field and helped them realize how synthetic biology can be helpful in everyday life. Lastly, our ‘Gil’ demonstrated the purpose of scientific research."

INTERNATIONAL MEDICAL STUDENT CONFERENCE 
In 2011, we, as Fatih_Turkey (Medical School Wetlab    Team) started “iGEM” by performing a presentation about Syntehtic Biology in    the world and in Turkey for Human Practice. We have arranged the Second    International Medical Student Conference in Ankara. In the conference, papers    related to Synthetic Biology and the iGEM competition was presented    to inform medical school students coming from different medical schools in    and out of Turkey (e.g. Japan).
Burak Yilmaz, CEO of Sentegen, as our sponsor mentioned in his talk a wide    range of topics from discovery of DNA to Synthetic Biology, International    Genetically Engineered Machines (iGEM) and iGEM teams in Turkey.
Medical Students coming to our conference were informed about Synthetic    Biology Concept which consists of the design and construction of new    biological parts, devices and systems, and the re-design of existing, natural    biological systems for useful purposes such as genetically engineered medical    projects like Fast Wound Healing Project performed by METU-Gene Team at iGEM    2009. 
Especially, the students were excited when we mentioned the synthetic biology    projects like engineered bacteria having the ability to find and kill tumor    cells. In addition, we gave examples from the paper 'The impact of synthetic    biology on drug discovery published by Martin Fussenegger and Wilfried    Weber. From the paper, synthetic biology phenomenon was mentioned in the    conference in order to be used in medical schools to enable disease mechanisms    and target identification to be elucidated"

August 13 – 19, 2012
We purificated the DNA from the colony PCRs that were successful, and then digested it. Fortunately one digestion of ADF-3 and other of ADF-3 had the correct size.
Later we did PCR to amplify the backbones of ADF-3 and ADF-3+ (both with pBAD). But we made some errors and added the wrong primers.
The next day we repeated the PCR, and the backbone with pBAD of ADF-3 had the right size. Then we send for sequencing ADF-3 and ADF-3+. Later we realized that we sent the wrong sample of ADF-3!!
We also transformed some E. coli with backbone with pBAD of ADF-3. The following day we did colony PCR to these E. coli, but we did not obtain the desired  results. Then we cultivated the E. coli transformed with the backbone with pBAD of ADF-3 in 200 mL of LB with 1nM of arabinose.
August 20 – 26, 2012
We did colony PCR of 3 colonies transformed with the backbone with pBAD of ADF-3, but the results were negative. The next day we did colony PCR again, but this time with other method:
1) Put 100 mL of bacteria in eppendorf tubes of  2µl and heat at 95ºC for 10 minutes.
2) Centrifuge at maximum speed for 5 minutes.
3) Do Colony PCR with the supernatant as the template.
Unfortunately, the results were negative.
And we became the results from the sequencing. ADF-3 is incorrect (as we expected, because we sent the wrong sequence), and ADF-3+ is a bit weird. Bernardo never trusted the PCR band of this sequence anyway…
The next day we sent for sequencing ADF-3 (this time the right sequence). Some days later we became the results from this sequencing, and it were negative. This is terrible!
Finally, we prepared the materials for the community outreach activity for Penta UC, the Talents Development and Study Program at Catholic University. And we participated in this activity. More information in Human Practices/Community  Outreach.

We registered our team in the 2016 iGEM competition, worked very hard all summer and will attend the Jamboree at Boston!
We have completed the judging form
We received the deliverables through the post
We have created a page on our team wiki, where we have attributed each aspect of the project, clearly distinguishing our work from that of advisors and mentors as well as acknowledging sponsors.
We have contributed a collection of 18 parts, among which is BBa_K2148010 (mRaspberry fluorescent protein), which has been documented on the registry, establishing the phytobrick standard in iGEM (first chloroplast part in the competition!). We hope this will kickstart the use of plastid synthetic biology among future iGEM teams!
SILVER
VALIDATED PART
We have validated our parts, submitted to the registry by sequencing and/or restriction digests.
Experimental validation of aadA (BBa_K2148001 officially in registry) as seen through bacterial transformation.
Possible to make L1 constructs for the experimental validation of parts through biolistic transformation of CW15 C. reinhardtii strain.
We have also confirmed the correct insertion of all our 18 parts, either by sequencing of restriction digest. Check out wiki for more information on validation of hardware and software projects!
COLLABORATIONS
Collaborated with Imperial iGEM team by providing them with Chlamydomonas growth data, for use with their computer model A.L.I.C.E.
We established a close relationship with LiU iGEM team, also working on C. reinhardtii, by sharing weekly reports and skype meetings to follow up on each other’s work and advice on protocols.
Attended and presented at the EU-funded Bio-Design Night science hosted in Paris along with the iGEM Paris-Bettencourt team.

06-06: Meeting with the CEO of Sunwaterlife
We presented our project to Christophe Campéri-Ginestet who seems to be interested, especially by the detection function of V. cholerae. He would like to adapt it to the Sunwaterlife filters in order to have a direct colored response according to the water contamination. In addition, he would be willing to invest in our project in order to apply for JEI status (or “Young Innovative Enterprises” in english), a very interesting status for start-ups allowing them to have financial advantages. Besides, a collaboration is discussed so that Sunwaterlife provide us with their membranes, allowing us to confine our microorganisms within a device. He told us that he might be able to put us in touch with a UNICEF person in charge of cholera epidemics.
You can read the result of his testimony here.
06-08: 18th brainstorming
We’ve divided the subject in 3 modules. The “Quorum” module, with E. coli engineered to produce C8-CAI-1; the “Detection” module, with V. harveyi engineered to detect C8-CAI-1 and produce diacetyl in response; and the “Killing” module with P. pastor"

Collaboration
Having a lot of interactions with great teams, we were able to get a lot of good experience. Valuable experience we have gained with colleagues through iGEM is as follows.
Collaboration with UT-Tokyo software team
This year, there is another team from the University of Tokyo in the software track.  We used “Biobrick Search” which this team made when we searched biobricks. We gave feedback on our impressions and problems it had. This seemed to be beneficial for both our and the software team.
May festival
The UT-Tokyo team held a communication room in the university festival, the May Festival during May 19th and 20th, 2012. The contents are here . We cooperated with other teams in Japan (KAIT Japan, Tokyo-NoKoGen, Saitama) in organizing this communication room.  May Festival usually attracts over 10,000 people. So, this festival is a very good opportunity to get a lot of people to learn about iGEM. More people became interested in iGEM after attending our booth. Each team put up posters about their project, and explained them to people who were interested. By co-hosting the event, we think people were realized that there are various teams in the competition, with many projects. This also led to making an opportunity to strengthen collaboration between teams in Japan.
A social event with teams from Japan
On August 13, a social event was held by teams participating in 2012 iGEM from Japan. 5 teams; Tokyo Metropolitan University, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Kyoto University, University of Tokyo (software) and our team participated. Tokyo Metropolitan University hosted. Each team presented for 40 minutes about their team projects and human practices followed by questions. There were two aims for"

Edinburgh,2010,Team:Edinburgh#Bacterial#Core repressilator_-_-_TEXT.html," CcaS, which we are planning on using in our green light receptor, was measured by Hirose et al. (2008) .
In accordance with the above, the challenge was then to design and characterise luciferases compatible with the sensors. In this, we decided to build on previous work by Ljubljana 2007 and Edinburgh 2009 . The firefly luciferase from Photinus pyralis deposited as a BioBrick by the former formed the base of our red and green light producing proteins, while the bacterial luciferase LuxAB from Xenorhabdus luminescens BioBricked by last year's Edinburgh team was our blue light protein.
The emission peak of the wildtype firefly luciferase is roughly 557nm at pH 7.8 according to Branchini et al. (2005) . We needed to mutate this towards the red spectrum in order to activate the Cph8-based red light sensor, and also proposed to introduce a mutation towards the green spectrum so as to better match it with our hypothetical green light sensor. The LuxAB-LumP fusion already available in the Registry was theoretically already of the correct wavelength to activate the blue light sensor, although further characterisation was necessary. The theoretical spectra of the luciferases we sought to create are displayed in Figure 5 .

JUDGING FORM ⇗
Team Stanford-Brown-RISD was based in the NASA Ames Research Center for the summer of 2018, and worked on developing habitats for Mars and the Moon through the use of fungal mycelium.
Transportation of material through space is a basic yet fundamental component of many of NASA’s goals and objectives. Whether this material is equipment needed to test for life on Mars or structures that allow for prolonged habitation, it must travel from earth to its planetary of lunar destination, thus incurring great economic and energetic costs. But what if it didn’t have to be transported from earth? What if it could be grown on planet? The Stanford-Brown-RISD iGEM team proposed to explore the use of fungal mycelium, the vegetative structure of fungi, as a light-weight, durable material that could be grown on planet using spores to create habitats and other necessary items. The team focused on developing a design for a habitat from mycelium as a proof of concept, and using synthetic biology to enhance the filtration and adhesion capabilities of the mycelium. The team further explored the implications and uses of these biodegradable, self-growing structures made of fungi on Earth.
Our overall project can be broken down into four sub-projects. These are characterized as the following: Mycelium Material & Habitat Development, Mycelium Glue Project, Mycelium Filter Project, and finally the Mission Architecture that ties everything together. Major accomplishments included selecting and growing fungi on promising substrates, designing prototype habitats and growing actual structures such as a human-rated stool, the production of functional biological glues, a filter the effectively removed copper from solution, and an overall proposed mission architecture informed by our model, lab results and integrated human practices."

Tried extrusion, this time with PEEK tubing (0.005 inch inner diameter) cut with the tubing cutter
tube length was 10 mm
dope was 20% w/v cellulose acetate with a few drops of blue food coloring
extrusion rate of 6 uL/min
fibers still don't form. Rather, the dope blobs up upon coming into contact with the water
some observations:
the syringe pump inevitably reaches a point where it stops pushing. The motor is still working, but the drive screw is clearly not moving at all (and hence, the drive block isn't moving). Curiously, dope still comes out of the tubing when the motor is stalled
periodically, an air bubble comes out from the tube -- is this an indication that there is air in the tubing? Air is something that might be providing huge back pressure against the motor's force
speaking of air bubbles, I'm not able to load a syringe with dope without there being air bubbles in the dope.
I tried removing the plunger and pipetting dope in. But when inserting the plunger back in, bubbles are formed at the plunger/dope interface.
I tried using a large diameter needle to draw dope up. But there is inevitably dead space in the needle that is introduced into the syringe as bubbles.
a thin stream can be observed rising from the tip of the tube to the surface of the water. I think that this is acetone leaving the dope. The question is, is acetone leaving the dope that's already in the coagulation bath, or leaving the dope that's inside of the tube? If it's the latter, then that may explain why the motor stops being able to push out the dope.
At the end of the day, I just removed the water bath and wiped down the tip of the tubing with acetone. I'll try again tomorrow and see what happens.

If the levels of LacI at steady state are high, we are repressing more the production of protein of interest, so we will get a lower initial rate of protein production as the Lac promoter is stronger (higher PoPs output)
If we take into account leakiness of the Lac promoter, we will see a higher basal amount of protein of interest initially than in the non-leaky case.
When IPTG is added in, it will undergo a secondary reaction with LacI, thus, de-repressing the pathway, so we will see a bump in production of the protein of interest.
These effects are transient. LacI has a constitutive equilibrium, so after sometime, it will return to its original state and repress production of protein of interest once again.
The more IPTG we add in, the more LacI we will remove initially from the system, so the more output protein produced for a given period of time.

Abstract
As a first year joining the iGEM, we have insufficient experience about how to set up a team or what on earth does iGEM want us to do. So, we sought help from the experienced undergraduates since they have an edge over us on either biological knowledge or experience of iGEM competition. Luckily, We found assistance from TJU iGEM 2015 which has an assistance project for other teams this year by spreading the handbooks. Notably, we have accepted one in Chinese version from them, which then become a convenient and useful tool for us to get familiar with this competition. Information like the prolonged history, necessary knowledge about synthetic biology, requirements for medals and projects of other outstanding teams are all recorded in a single book. Therefore, we master the basic principles of experiment for synthetic biology and requirements of the competition in a fastest way.
Requirement of experiment
After communicating with the experiment teams, we find out that they need inspiration when choosing projects, information when starting on projects and tools when processing data and diagram.
Offer of software
And then, we consider what software can do to help the experiment teams. After the brainstorming and we get the answer we want. The introduction of previous projects will kindle their inspiration of their projects and give them the chance to stand on the shoulders on their ancestors. The tags help to well classify all the information and save lots of time. And the synsketch will help them draw clear and standardized flow diagrams of experiment. IGEMers can use this tool to consummate their projects.
Collaboration with the experiment teams
So, we establish a close connection with the experiment teams.
This summer, we have nice collaborations with teams like SCUT-China , SYSU-China , SKLBC-China . And we really appreciate the help and communications among teams.
Meet-up    2015 July 14th
At that day, the members of three software teamsincluding SKLBC-China, SYSU-Software as well as our team, SKLBC-GDSYZX and three laboratory teamsincluding SCUT, SCUT-China and SYSU-China, gathered together in the lab of SCUT. We discussed and exchanged thoughts about the relationship and interaction between the software and experiment of synthetic biology. At this meet-up, we also showed our projects with each other, after which we got lots of useful advice and"

(a)The number of sgRNA results
As we have seen, the number of sgRNA results of three software are all 14, in addition, the 14 sgRNA sequences are all the same(just the rank are different), proves our software’s approach to find sgrna is correct.
(b)The ranking of sgRNA results
Since three software have different scoring algorithm, so the rankings are not exactly the same. In addition, for our scoring which contains an efficacy score, so the rank of CRISPR-X and the other two software vary greatly. However, for specific scores, in some degree, the ranking trend of our software and the other two software are similar.

Discussion regarding the presentation slide during the preliminary round. Task allocated to all the members. While Joanne and Steven had to write the project proposal ASAP. Not much were done today. But TGIF !! Had some photo session after the meeting. Joanne go crazy with the effect thingy on the MacBook. Stressed up after one week of intensive meeting.

We are all so excited today because we having a photoshooting session this afternoon.  We asked another classmate of us, Jason to be our professional photographer. It looks like all of us are good model. It started to drizzle when we were moving to another spot. Too bad we only can do indoor photoshoot. Nevermind, we can have another one in the laboratory next time. In the evening, we also had a meeting with Prof. Ingrid. We did a rehearsal about our preliminary round with her. We really have to speed up to improve our slideshow so that we could stand a chance in the coming competition.

We had our second rehearsal. And we checked the email, too bad there’s no reply from the 3 professors who we send them the request letter.  I think we should stalk the professor in the facebook.

We had a quick briefing with Steven today. We just got the instructions to attend a meeting with our organizer on 26th of July.
Our preliminary is fixed on 22th July 12 noon. It’s only a week left, we have to work hard !!

Stanford,2009,Team:Stanford#ProjectPage_-_-_TEXT.html," begin to cause inflammatory damage to the microenvironment of the colon by (1) proliferating unexpectedly and (2) becoming self-recognizing.  Thus, a device designed to ameliorate the effects of recurring Crohn's disease would have to curb the proliferation of Th17 cell types.  Simultaneously, this device would have to increase the immunosuppressive response in the colon to decrease the damage caused by the self-recognizing Th17 cells.
Project Overview
Given the project's context in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), Stanford iGEM strove to develop a therapy that addresses the weaknesses of current treatments for IBD.  Taking a bioengineering approach that could avoid the drawbacks of medications and circumvent the risks inherent to surgical procedures, the team tackled IBD at its source by designing a microbial device that is capable of monitoring and regulating imbalances in ratio of T helper 17 (Th17) cells to regulatory T cells (Treg) cells.  With this project as a model, the team hoped to prototype a probiotic capable of autonomously determining loss of homeostasis and exerting measures to restore balance in helper T-cell ratios.
Markers involved in Device Regulation
Because the envisioned microbial construct is a biological input/output device, it must have the appropriate sensors to detect Th17 and Treg cell balance and the appropriate generators to output factors to restore balance.  First, the team identified two markers of Th17 and Treg activity: nitric oxide (NO) and 5-methyltryptophan (5MT) concentration levels.  These two markers serve as the inputs to the device.  In other words, the device senses concentration levels of these two markers to determine the balance between Th17 and Treg cell populations.  If the inputs indicate an imbalance, the device will produce factors to restore balance.  The team next identified two factors, retinoic acid (RA) and Interleukin–6 (IL-6), that can control production of Th17 and Treg cells in vivo.  Thus the device is engineered to produce heterologous RA and IL-6 in response to signals from the device sensor indicating imbalanced Th17 and Treg populations.
Chassis Considerations
The team chose Escherichia coli to use as the chassis for the sensors and generators.  The advantages of using E. coli are that the species is well characterized, tractable for bioengineering, and perhaps most importantly, native to the human gastrointestinal microbiota (depending on strain).  This last point ultimately enables our device to be assimilated into an IBD"
Aberdeen_Scotland,2009,Team:Aberdeen Scotland#ethics_-_-_TEXT.html," ethically unresolvable within the Western tradition?  Very few.  Of course, there is endless room for disagreement and debate, but not to a degree which must fracture societies.’  Furthermore, ‘That there are periodic unresolvable issues does not mean that ethics doesn’t work.’  These points are instructive to all of us concerning synthetic biology.  The idea that there are not countless, all mutually incompatible positions throughout the majority of ethical frameworks give us less reason to exclude these from the thought process on developing the research.  Even on particulars where some remain irreconcilable, this cannot be interpreted as an ethical failure or warrant a marginalisation of ethics in the field.  Debate and discussion are an intrinsic part of scientific history and development and indeed reason itself can be understood as thought and argument, so these should if anything be encouraged within synthetic biology.  Cho et al argue for a need for ‘scientific and public policy communities [to] stop placing religion and science in opposite camps when it comes to advances in science’ (Cho et al, 1999).  Particularly in synthetic biology with so many potential empowering and beneficial possibilities, many religious individuals and institutions are far from hostile towards it.  ‘the dominant view is that while there are reasons for caution, there is nothing in the research agenda for creating a minimal genome that is automatically prohibited by legitimate religious considerations. Moving forward with caution requires that the scientific communities be in continual conversation with the entire society, working together to address key ethical and religious concerns.’ (Cho et al, 1999).
In thinking about definitions of life, it should be recalled it was in fact scientific thinking that played a role in putting humanity back as a part of the rest of life on the planet through understanding of our evolution and such an almost ‘animist’ (Saul, 2001) tradition has played a role in many scientific arguments for seeing life as interconnected and more than just organized matter (Cho et al, 1999).
The discussion and debate here will surely centre on the absence of a fixed definition to answer what ‘life’ is. Edward Machery, a philosopher of science at University of Pittsburgh has gone as saying the idea of a stable definition would be ‘impossible and useless’ (Balmer, 2008), that synthetic biologists are confused over what life is and how complex it must be.  Similarly an editorial in Nature in 2007 argued ‘It would be a service to more than synthetic biology if we might now be permitted to dismiss the idea that life is a precise scientific concept’ (Balmer, 2008).  Perhaps the"

At the Rudolfsplatz a lot of speeches and talks from a variety of journalists, physicists and biologists, like Ranga Yogeshwar and Mark Benecke were given. We discussed fakes news and biased data of governmental proclamations as well as the repression of scientific work. An additional important aspect was the responsibility of the scientific community in representing themselves to the general public. Therefore the work of science journalists is very important for public relations. Some of the speeches picked out the working conditions of German scientists regarding permanent employment and resulting problems in life balance and family planning.
The speeches on the event were very informative and showed how important it is to be well received by the public. This event was the reason why our team decided to put more effort into public relations."

ProteInProgress: a cellular assembly line for protein manufacturing
Solutions
Several solutions were explored in this project to potentially improve the industrial production of recombinant proteins.
Self-inducible promoters were considered to avoid the usage of inducible systems especially in large-scale industrial bioprocesses, in which protein production has to be triggered by expensive inducer molecules.
Standard and user friendly integrative vectors for E. coli and S. cerevisiae were designed to stably integrate the expression systems of interest in the microbial host genome and to eliminate the need of expensive selection techniques, such as antibiotics or auxotrophic media.
Finally, an ""in-cell"" protein purification system was implemented using BioBrick parts: PolyHydroxyAlkanoate (PHA) granules were used as a substrate for PHA-binding peptides (Phasins) fused to the target protein, while a pH-based self-cleaving peptide (Intein) was used instead of a protease cleavage site. This solution can thus replace the usage of expensive affinity resins/columns and proteases.

Self-inducible promoters
The aim of this section is the realization and characterization of a library of self-inducible promoters. These devices are promoters able to initiate the production of the target protein when the cell culture reaches the desired culture density.
Exploiting quorum sensing mechanism...
Different studies demonstrated that many bacteria can communicate through a mechanism called quorum sensing and can regulate gene expression relying on cell culture density. One of the most studied organisms is V. fischeri, for which the quorum sensing is regulated by two genes: luxI and luxR. The first one encodes a protein responsible for the synthesis of 3-oxo-C6-homoserine-lactone (3OC6HSL or simply HSL), a small molecule called autoinducer. The second one encodes a protein capable to bind the HSL. The lux pR promoter, which is normally off, can be activated by the LuxR-HSL complex when the autoinducer reaches a critical concentration.
When a cell population expresses luxI, the concentration"

But there was no feasible possibility to store the energy. The resulting problem was the dependency while the electric net is not stable. The instability was caused by a blackout of one or more sources.
The new system could grant stability through generating a storable substance. The substance could be easily combusted to generate energy again. The system was biologically based. Bacteria would use electricity to generate energy for their growth and carbon dioxide to provide pyruvate for the synthesis of isobutanol. So with this new, innovative system, the village would be able to use the regenerative produced energy and store the excess energy as an emergency supply.
The agent told the citizen that the village would be renamed. Every village like Amberville got a name for the kind of energy which grants the highest energy outcome. The village Amberville got its name because of the yellow color of the eponym. In Amberville it was the generation via photovoltaic panels.
Now the project made its first progress because the experiment showed that regenerative energy could not be the only source. With the conversion to energy storage the village would be named Malachiteville. The green color of the malachite should symbolize the turn towards the biology as well as the usage of regenerative energy. In the next years it would not matter which energy source produces the most part of the energy. It would just matter that energy could be stored and reused.

Search the Database & Adapt
Although we had a strong idea of what we wanted our presentation to look like we wanted advice on how to structure the poster presentation. The event was three hours and beyond the emphasis on women presenters we weren't sure how to manage the evening. We used the Database to find other poster presentations and loved what Manchester 2016 did during their EuroScience Open Forum. The team presented their poster as a large group emphasizing the importance of their multidisciplinary research. After reading about this we determined a component of our presentation needed to include all the women on the team, and that we needed to cover the importance of having multidisciplinary involvement in our project. Our work is not possible without computer scientists, biologists, chemists and mathematicians and our presentation emphasized that.
Implementation
On September 21st, William and Mary hosted a poster presentation as part of the school’s “Women Weekend.” Our team presented our iGEM project, and had the honor of talking extensively approximately 20 of the over 100 attendees. All 100 attendees were able to review our poster during the walking dinner provided. As the attendees stopped by our poster, we would explain our project in the detail that best fit the attendee. Many of the women did not have an extensive biology background, and thus we focused heavily on applications of both our project and the field of SynBio. On the other hand, a few women had advanced experience in STEM and one woman we talked to had a PhD in biology. These women were able to ask perceptive and astute questions regarding our project. They were amazed by how far techniques in biology have progressed.
Reflect & Record
The event was a fantastic experience for the team and the alumni alike. Many of the women were blown away by what our lab was able to accomplish, and several of them expressed how proud they were of their alma mater. The women with backgrounds in STEM in particular helped provide a lot of perspective to our first year team members. This year we are using a method called 3G Assembly , many of our new members have only ever used this method of DNA assembly. After talking to some of the alumni who were familiar with the Golden-Gate and Gibson Assembly methods we more fully understood just how lucky we were to be using this new technology.
While the women we talked to were very enthusiastic about our project, many of them were not particularly interested in the details of the science. Rather than confuse them with unnecessary information, we boiled our project into a few short, easily understandable sentences, and spent most of the time on"

At the end of the     day and after a successfull workshop, they gave us feedback on our performance     as well as the experiments we had chosen for them. We took many of their comments     into account for developing the Mini-Kit, which is described in detail below.

Open Plant Forum and Workshop, Cambridge
At a later occasion, three team members went on a trip to Cambridge,   UK where we followed the Open Plant Forum in July and more specifically   the part of it that treated cell-free synthetic biology. We were able to  get in touch with Keith Pardee, on whose paper 1 we based the toehold part of our project (a toehold switch gets triggered by   a complementary trigger sequence, unfolds and let's the downstream reporter   gene be transcribed). Together we talked about our experimental setup, because   at the time we were quite desperate as we hadn’t managed to get the toehold   switch to unfold yet, so it was a relief to hear we were on the good track.   We were working on a software to streamline the process of finding toehold/trigger   pairs from a given input sequence, which would be the first computer program of its   kind and a great tool for anyone working with toehold switches, so we also discussed   our approach to the code with Pardee, namely how much weight certain parameters in   our scoring function could be attributed.
By chance we met the Oxford iGEM team at that very same conference, and it    was the beginning of a fruitful collaboration as they also work on a cell-free    biosensor and we were able to exchange protocols and ideas on improving the    E.Coli lysate reaction later on. However the highlight of this trip was definitely    the one-day workshop on the integration of cell-free biology in the educational    system of the UK. Named “Open Plant curriculum development working group”, this    workshop was an interactive opportunity to discuss the advantages of including    cell-free biology in the UK’s high school curricula and exchange ideas on the    implementation thereof. Our first-hand knowledge of manipulating and making E.Coli    lysate was a good starting point for many conversations, as we were closest to the    target age group and were able to contribute unique points of view.
At the end of the day, we were convinced that cell-free biology will provide    high schools with an amazing tool to explain certain principles of biology    ("

Hello everybody!
Welcome on our home page!
My name is Berit Haßing and I am a member of the iGEM team of the Georg-August University Göttingen. As most of the other team members I am currently in the second semester of the master study course “microbiology and biochemistry” and I really enjoy studying here in Göttingen! Last year I gained my bachelor degree in the department of microbiology of the University of Osnabrück and currently I am planning to further specialize in the field of microbiology and genetics.  I decided to participate in the iGEM competition because of the possibility plan a complete project and to work independently in a group with further students. Of course I hope to learn a lot and meet interesting new people at the jamborees!
Greetings

Bianca Genenncher
Hello everybody and welcome to our wiki. My name is Bianca Genenncher and I am a member of the first iGEM team of the University of Göttingen. It is my second year of the Biochemistry and Microbiology Master in Göttingen and I just finished my first lab rotation in the microbe-plant interaction department of Prof. Schirawski. During my Bachelor studies in Göttingen my main focus pointed towards the molecular plant biology examining the plant´s reaction on invading pathogens. Last year, I was studying in Scotland at the University of Aberdeen. I really enjoyed my time abroad working together with students from other countries with interesting cultural backgrounds. This is my first iGEM participation. I am highly motivated to start doing the experiments and gain the first experience designing own experiments. Another reason for me to participate is the internationality of this competition. I am also looking forward to have rewarding discussions about the results or different ways to reach the aim with my kind team members.

Report on Government Regulation
We searched past and present legislation to find how the various levels of government mandate the regulation of naphthenic acids in the oil sands. This culminated in a report that is summarized below.
The full report, including all references, can be downloaded in PDF format here .
Report Summary
Minimized environmental impact in oil and gas production is an increasingly important goal for both government and industry. This is the result of society’s growing awareness and concern for environmental degradation. Concern continues to increase due to the ever-expanding scale and production rates of oil sands tailings generation and the resulting increased safety risks to humans and the natural environment. Based on this social pressure, government responds by expanding or developing legislation to create further restrictions to push industry to be more responsible and accountable in regards to environmental impact.
In 2008, Alberta Energy Resources Conservation Board’s (ERCB) reported that 0.1 cubic meter (m3) of fine tailings is produced with the processing of one tonne of oil sands. After an initial tailings consolidation period of 3 to 5 years, this volume is further condensed to around 0.05 m3 to 0.06 m3 of mature fine tailings. For an average 100,000 barrel-per-day facility, approximately 195,000 tonnes of oil sands are processed, translating to nearly 20,000 m3 of fine tailings per day as the byproduct.
The current industry standard for the analysis of NAs in tailings samples is performed using Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrometer (FTIR). FTIR involves a filtered acid"
