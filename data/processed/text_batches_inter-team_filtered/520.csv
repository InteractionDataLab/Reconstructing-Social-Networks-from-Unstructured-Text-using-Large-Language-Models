CLSB-UK,2017,Team:CLSB-UK#Hardware#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," the dilutions is visible on the graph, as the distances betwen the points and the lines of best fit are similar both with the green filter and with no filter. The no filter readings are higher as fluorescence is provided in arbitrary units, as they are the light intensity readings without being calibrated against a blank. Without the filter less light is blocked and thus there is increased levels.
We were surprised results without the filter. We expected greater errors caused by variations in ambient light and the input blue light. The input source light must therefore be very consistent and also quite directional so as not to significantly affect the readings. For reference, we used a Nichia Superflux LEDs, product code NSPBR70BSS. However, we don't think there's anything particularly special about this LED - it may be an idea for future projects to test LEDs to see if there is a benefit to using a specific type or brand.
Conclusions
The results follow the trends we expected them to, demonstrating that our combined fluorometer and densitometer has high linearity and thus is an effective measurement tool. It could therefore be developed commercially to be used in diagnostics, especially in developing countries. This is further explored on our silver human practices page .
We characterized the linearity of our light sensor (TSL235R) with optical density readings of LUDOX, and found it performed very well.
Aachen 2014 characterized the linearity of the same light sensor (TSL235R) to detect fluoroescence of purified iLOV, [1] and our results with fluorescein are concordant. Using the same light sensor also means our work further characterizes their fluorometer.
Unfortunately we don’t have a plate reader at our school so we were unable to test the same samples with commercial equipment to compare the performance. However, the linearity graphs and Aachen’s previous work characterizing the light sensor (TSL235R) demonstrate that our hardware has real potential to reduce the costs and increase the accessibility of a screening programme.

Introduction
In light of the BBa_J33206 BioBrick (the arsR gene + arsR binding site) from the Spring Distribution possibly lacking the lacZ gene (as described in the Parts Registry), Chris French from Edinburgh University has kindly sent us the original BioBrick DNA as well as forward and reverse sequencing primers and forward and reverse PCR primers.
The sequencing primers should enable us to determine whether the BBa_J33206 BioBrick DNA (which we have midi-prepped)from the Spring Distribution contains the lacZ gene; if it does not then this means the unusually light bands seen in the gel (created from digests of the pSB1A2 plasmid which released the BBa_J33206 BioBrick) are not erroneous at all. No matter what the result, we should transform some E.coli with the 5ul of DNA sent to us.
Today's experiments involve sending our midi-prepped BBa_J33206 + pSB1A2 DNA (derived from the Spring Distributions) off to be sequenced using the sequencing primers and also to transform E. coli with the BBa_J33206 BioBrick DNA sent to us.
Also, we will carry out PCR reactions along with the sporulation team in order to amplify czrA gene, ArsR BioBrick without the promoter region, and the cadA promoter region.

The first step taken was to quantify the midi-prepped BBa_J33206 +"
UC_San_Diego,2018,Team:UC San Diego#Public Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html,"visibility is a huge problem for women and sexual minorities in STEM – little dialogue and role models are either present or even spoken about. For example, few know that Alan Turing, the founder of artificial intelligence, was gay. By simply knowing that sexual minorities exist and language is open and inclusive in a field, LGBTQ-identifying individuals can feel more comfortable and thrive in their environments.
In anticipation and response to this report, our team made it an effort to practice use of inclusive language, personal pronouns, and exercise impartial decision-making and responsibility distribution. Though certain genders and sexual minorities represent the minority in most places, taking the time to acknowledge that some people have struggles regarding certain issues makes them feel welcome and safe. It is this kind of an environment that ultimately produces the best quality work. With minimal effort, a community is shown that awareness is being spread about them, and it was with this in mind that we ultimately decided to assess inclusivity in iGEM.
Finally, we used our diversity report’s findings in order to propose a four-point plan that we believe iGEM as an organization can use to help these under-represented groups, centered around (1) inclusive language, (2) critical engagement with inclusive communication, (3) raising awareness of representation, (4) hosting workshops around diversity, equity, and inclusion
Reflection: The purpose of our survey and diversity report was to increase dialogue and bring greater awareness to issues regarding inclusivity in synthetic biology. The survey assessed members’ personal iGEM experiences and attempted to gain further understanding into how mentors, peers, and resources anticipated and addressed diverse backgrounds and individual identities. Questions were designed and answers were analyzed using the Ward-Gale framework for inclusivity in higher education, which was designed by researchers at the University of Birmingham. This model highlights the importance of inclusive role models, language, and curriculum/content in promoting a safe and welcoming environment for all genders and sexual identities. We were able to identify key differences between genders in terms of personal motivations and experiences; though statistically significant results were not present between different sexual orientations, general response differences showed that those identifying as heterosexual felt more comfortable in their respective iGEM environments than those identifying as a part of the LGBTQ community.
A larger sample size of LGBTQ-identifying folk would improve the study results; though responses from the LGBTQ community are hard to obtain due to lack of representation in general, a larger population would help generate a better idea of what kind of climate of inclusivity iGEM perpetuates. It is important to know if synthetic biology, being a relatively new field of study, is similar or different to other STEM disciplines"

Leiden,2016,Team:Leiden#Entrepreneurship_-_-_TEXT.html,", Mustard, stonecrop, cress and wheat. Unfortunately, these are             not the most efficient plants.
Rice, for             example, is a very nutritious crop, but it requires a lot of water. In             addition, one can only harvest it yearly. These two conditions make it             unsuitable for Mars.
Another             promising crop is the tepary bean. This bean requires very little water. It has             4 calories per gram. Additionally, it can be harvested every 60 days.             Unfortunately, this crop only yields 0.0645 kg/m2.
The potato has             a yield of 1.74 kg/m2. It does not require much more water than the tepary             bean. Considering a requirement of 2000 calories per day, one would need the             following things to be able to live off of potatoes:
1.       104 m2 of farmable land. A yield of 1.74 kg/m2 ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potato#Yield ) every 60             days corresponds to this area. This would provide 2000 calories on a daily             basis.
2.       10.6 Liters of water. ( https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2013/jan/10/how-much-water-food-production-waste ). To produce             one kilogram of potatoes, one needs 287 liters of water in total.
3.       A PH of 5.5-6
4.       19.9 tonnes of martian soil. Potatoes require a             soil depth of 0.1 meter. This, combined with the area needed, gives us the             required amount of soil.
 
1.99 tonnes of             Martian soil contains 199 kilograms of perchlorate. This is a lot of             perchlorate to reduce. Luckily, the process can be done iteratively. Namely:
1.       The astronaut puts an amount of sand in the             bioreactor, which contains the maximum amount of perchlorate the bioreactor can             process in one batch.
2.       One waits until the rate at which perchlorate is             broken down saturates.
3.       Add another batch of sand, start at 1.
The sand can             be used immediately, because the perchlorate is taken into the bioreactor. This             way, one can already arrange the purified sand, whilst the perchlorate is being             broken down. We place a water-proof canvas on the area we intend to use for            "

The cultures were then left in the 37°C shaker overnight and examined the next morning. We were pleased to note that the culture exposed to nitrate was visibly green whilst the one without was not, suggesting our new BioBrick worked at least at the most basic ‘on/ off’ level.
More detailed characterisation: 0 - 10mM assay
Experiment
Our next step was to set up and assay examining the BioBrick's behaviour between 0 – 10 mM of Potassium Nitrate at 2mM intervals. The same colony of MG1655 containing BBa_K381001 was used to inoculate six 5mL tubes of LB at varying nitrate levels as listed below. This was repeated twice to allow the results to be averaged.

Graphs
This data allowed us to construct graphs illustrating the trend in increased GFP production with increase in nitrate. The first images below show the raw data from the photo-spectrometer, and the graphs constructed from it.
We then used this data to generate a graph showing the average increase in GFP production, as illustrated below:
Unfortunately, because we only ran two repeats, we cannot be certain whether the downward curve of the graph is true behaviour or the result of one the 10mM readings being extremely low
Conclusions
From this data we are pleased to report that not only does our BioBrick definitely work - particularly within the range that is relevant"
Michigan,2018,Team:MichiganState#HP Expert Interviews_-_-_TEXT.html," future. I’ll admit however, that I still know very little about GMOs, and most of my education on them came from classes in graduate school. From what you've told me about your project, I do like what you are doing with your GMOs though.
What specifically do you dislike about GMOs? In other words, what do you see as the downsides of using GMOs?
On my personal farm, I don’t use GMOs because I am certified organic. Many customers rely on me to have non-GMO crops due to health concerns and strong opinions. On my old farm, Groundswell Farm, I didn’t have space for sweet corn and I was surrounded by corn fields. I couldn’t grow corn because my crops would be contaminated by GM corn nearby. Cross pollination scares me. Growing GMOs is also expensive--or at least developing them is expensive. Last I heard, it was something like a million dollars to produce a GMO. I like growing peppers, tomatoes, and lettuce that are not GMOs because GMOs of that produce are not profitable anyways.
How do you feel about GM crops vs crops grown with GM bacteria?
I need to look at more science in order to form an educated opinion. Organic regulations would not allow me to use such a product on my farm. GM inoculants also exist, but I always buy certified organic types for my farm.
Is there anything that we (us and scientists in general) could do that would make you feel more comfortable growing crops with GM bacteria (i.e. more experiments determining the safety of GMOs, applying GM bacteria to crops only in contained areas, etc.)?
I have no opposition to research that is done carefully, and for purposes that help small farmers and sustainable farmers. It’s about contentious landscaping. For example, Vitamin A rice, for good reason, met a lot of opposition. There were cultural barriers to switching to different varieties of rice. There was a lot of uncertainty about what GM rice would involve. I’m not completely sure what scientists could do, and want to look into it more.
What information sources have shaped your opinions on GMOs?
I took a class on GMOs in graduate school. Plus, I’m a farmer and farm worker in a bubble of organic agriculture and vegetable production. I’ve looked at information from the general press and trade literature of organic farming. I’ve met with many interesting and well educated people at farmers markets. I’ve met with individuals from a small local seed company, Ann Arbor Seed Company, who seemed justifiably nervous about GMO due to risks they have to their business model and the vision"

Our city & Our University
Xiamen:
Xiamen, also known as Amoy to the west, is a cozy city located in the southeastern part of China, and has a relaxing coastal charm with a population of 1.3 million. It's a historical harbor city which was founded in the mid-14 century, in the early years of the Ming Dynasty. In the early 1980's, Xiamen was declared as one of China's first Special Economic Zone, taking advantages of the city's heritage as a trading center and the proximity to Taiwan. In 2004 the city won the finals of the world's Human Settlements and Environment Award, ""Nations in Bloom"". Xiamen is one of China's most attractive and best-maintained resort city, and attracts a large number of foreign and local tourists. The city is easily accessible by air, and there are direct flights from Hong Kong, Kuala Lumpur, Osaka, Seoul, Singapore and Tokyo. Within China, Xiamen airport is linked to more than 30 domestic airports.
Xiamen University:
Xiamen University (XMU), also known as Universitas Amoiensis in Latin, is one of the top universities in China. It was founded in 1921 by Tan Kah-Kee, the well-known patriotic overseas Chinese leader. As an integrated university, XMU owns a comprehensive branches of discipline as well as many specialized institutes. Economy, counting, chemistry, life science and marine science all win high fame nationwide and even worldwide. The main campus of XMU locates in a picturesque setting between the sea and a scenic mountain, spreading over 150 hectares, and is generally regarded as the most beautiful campus in China.

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html," will express RFP when the ammonia concentration is below the threshold. When the ammonia concentration exceeds the safe value, our bacteria will stop expressing RFP. With the help of our engineered bacteria, we can convert the concentration of ammonia nitrogen into a more readable optical signal.
After transmitting optical signal, our device should be able to convert optical signal into electrical signal, and then make the electrical signal readable to fish farmers. We use photoresistance to achieve the first step and code a program to accomplish the second step. When the concentration of ammonia is above the threshold, fish farmers will receive a message on their cellphone sent via Bluetooth to warn them (See more details on in hardware ).
As for ammonia degradation, we planned to express three different enzymes form different organisms to achieve the aim of convert ammonia into nitrogen gas.
Adjustment
Nothing can be accomplished at one stroke. After we completed the design of our device, we still need to customize it to the practical conditions.
The first thing we need to know is the composition of fish pond water. We visited some fish ponds nearby and collected water sample from the ponds. We then analyzed the composition of our water sample and adjust the composition of our culture medium to stimulate the pond water (See more details on water sampling in Integrated HP). We also asked other iGEM Teams to help us collected water samples in their surroundings (See more details in collaboration).
The second thing we need to do is to engineer our bacteria to make it express RFP under certain concentration of ammonia. To achieve this, we designed and tested three different promotors and chose the best one among them (See more details on promotors in sensor).
Last but not least, we did market research and contacted with our potential customers, fish farmers, to optimize our device according to the demand (See more details in integrated HP and entrepreneurship ).
For convenient detection of ammonia nitrogen in fishponds, a device was designed based upon our sensor bacteria, which express RFP in low ammonia concentration water. The device is able to provide relatively accurate information while the cost is lower than most ammonia detection equipment on the market. The user only needs to fix our equipment on a buoy or a platform, and to purify the water when receiving the text message that the device automatically sends to him/her.
Design
Immobilization
As a mature technology which has fully developed in the past 100 years, the immobilization of bacteria at present is widely applied in various fields ranging from pharmaceutical industry to sewerage system. Embedding method is the most common one to realize bacterial immobilization. Immobilizing living bacteria in carrier like sodium alginate, cellulose and agar"

Level 10 Comics
Suhas and Deepak from Level 10 comics came to inspire us and learn about synbio. They've started up an awesome comic company that makes dystopian comics set in India, inspired by mythologies... The Rabhas incident is our favourite, a gory zombie-fest set in modern-day Bangalore, its iconic buildings and streets all-too recognizable. We introduced synbio, then learnt about the process and decisions in making comics. Very, very inspiring afternoon.
The Clearing
In the evening, another method of storytelling about science. We went to see The Clearing by Gautam Raja, a play about invasive species. ""The Clearing evolved from the month-long Theatrescience residency at the  National Centre for Biological Sciences  (NCBS) in January 2009, and is based on scientific input from Dr. Suhel Qader relating to “causes and consequences of invasions: the ecology and evolution of invasive species”, with additional information from the NGO"

Modern technology makes information acquisition more convenient, but there is no other way better than face-to-face communication. The conference provided teams with an opportunity to learn about each other. Meaningful exchanges in ideas enhanced the efficiency of problem solving. That’s why we tried our best to make a relaxing and pleasure atmosphere for participants, by providing delicious snacks and conference meals.
Attendance of CCIC helped all the teams acquire both reflections and inspiration from communicating, and improved the projects in the end. All in all, we believe that the conference will make a significant improvement for all CCiC attendees in the Giant Jamboree.

XMU-China,2018,Team:XMU-China#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," concentration of 1 g/L to preserve Cas13a. They discovered that while CAHS 94205 preserved Cas13a's RNase-like activity after drying, CAHS 94205 could not preserve its specificity. This is exactly the same as ours when the concentration is 1 g/L. Therefore, we believe that it is possible that they just did not find the most suitable storage concentration, and if the concentration is properly reduced, the results may be much better.
Conclusion
According to the experimental results of lyophilization above, we can clearly see the preservation effect of SAHS protein on protein activity. Secondly, when the concentration is too high, SAHS protein may affect the normal function of protein. Therefore, it is necessary to find the most appropriate concentration. The optimal concentration may vary slightly among different proteins, but the preservation of biological activity by SAHS proteins is undoubtable. We believe that SAHS protein is a promising bioactive protective agent for different preservative substances, as long as the appropriate preservation system is set up.
Verify the expression of CAHS protein
Figure 7. The circuit of BBa_K2623014
In the circuit, the Lac I was expressed constantly, and Lac O, lac repressor was bound to Lac O. Following the CAHS gene was our reporter gene mRFP (J04650). When we added IPTG in the bacterial solution, the IPTG bound to repressor and inactivated it. So the CAHS gene and mRFP would start to express.
Figure 8. the E.coli DH5а with BBa_K2623014 and IPTG turns red.(D+ is E.coli DH5а with BBa_K2623014 and IPTG, D- is E.coli DH5а with BBa_K2623014 without IPTG, D0 is E.coli DH5а without BBa_K2623014)
We found that the red fluorescent protein expressed very slowly. After we added IPTG in the 4mL bacterial solution, we put the bacterial solution in 25°C shaker culture. After 12 hours, we saw the centrifugal precipitation color showed red.
We also did experiment with E.coli BL21, but the bacteria didn't turn red.
We cultured the E.coli BL21 which contained the plasmid of CAHS protein (BBa_K2623014) in the fluid medium. When the value of OD600 reached about 0.6, we took 4mL bacteria solution in the glass test tubes and added 4 μL IPTG in the tubes"

Calgary,2013,Team:Calgary Entrepreneurial#Team_-_-_TEXT.html,", which probably means that I really, really need to get a life.  This summer I am looking forward to stepping outside the lab and tackling an entrepreneurial project. I am incredibly excited to see what we discover and hopefully see our FRED project from last year move into the real world. I’ll no doubt still be enjoying the late nights in the lab, but will hopefully be able to gain a good perspective on the business side of things. In my spare time I enjoy beating David at flight control, collecting stuffed pandas as well as taking drinks from my favourite water fountain in the Health Sciences Centre.
David Lloyd
This is my fifth year being involved in iGEM in which time I have had the opportunity to work with the Alberta team for two years as an undergraduate, two years as a team advisor for Calgary Collegiate, and now with the Calgary Entrepreneurial Team. I have completed a BSc and MSc in Biochemistry and now am pursuing the FREDsense Technologies venture full time. I am very passionate for using my synthetic biology experience as a manager, entreprenuer, and educator and hope to merge these passions into an exciting career in the future. iGEM has been an amazing opportunity and I greatly look forward to another year in the competition!
Robert Mayall
I have just graduated with my Bachelors degree from the University of Calgary. This is my third year being involved with iGEM, and my first trip into the entrepreneurial category. I was heavily involved in the technical design of FRED and am the electrochemist for our group. I will continue my technical role as a member of FREDsense Technologies by focusing on the development of our platform technology.
Lisa Oberding
I graduated recently from the University of Calgary with a degree in Cellular, Molecular, and Microbial Biology, and am now pursuing my M.Sc. in Petroleum Microbiology. This is my second year with iGEM, which I got involved with as a chance to gain more research experience, learn about synthetic biology, and further define my research interests. I was involved last year with developing the sensor element of FRED, however moving forward with FREDsense I have found myself taking on more of a business focused role. I find that I am enjoying the experience of learning a completely foreign skill-set as well as getting to see science and research from a completely new direction.

NOTEBOOK
Sunday 15th May
Our idea was passed in the school-level match, our team was finally set up after almost one month`s working. iGEM, we were coming.
Saturday 6th June
The design of experiment was finished, the gene would be sent in four weeks less. The leader said we would focus on the other parts.
Friday 24th June
We collected the works the iGEMer used to finish on our project and made it a Data Pool, which made us more understand the real meaning of our works.
Monday 11th July
Today is third day after final exam, we had chatted a lot about our project. After the discussion, we chose different type groups which we were interested about. The professor told us the train would be hard. God, crush it on me!!
Tuesday 12th July
Today we almost watched the advisors doing the experiment the whole time. They told us how to use the basic tools and what we should pay more attentions on, especial about protecting ourselves. And I inoculated my first E.coli.
Thursday 14th July
We started to learn about the molecular experiment, Luo got a wonderful result in his trying. The human practice group put out our questionnaires, and we were told to give it away. Kuria said she was working on the logo and the logo would be on fire. Waiting for the fire :).
Friday 15th July
Our gene arrived! Luo said we could work as different groups now. I wish the gene circuit would be finished as fast as it could be.
Wednesday 17th July
The logo of our team was completed. I have to commend Kuria for her painting. It was on fire indeed, but most of our team said it looks like a turkey. LOL
Saturday 13th August
The construction of expression cassette and the engineering bacterium succeeded. The fermentation and induction would start. We will use the liquid chromatography to test the desulfur-ability of our bacterium by using the whole cell catalysis.

5. GIBSON ASSEMBLY
We have successfully used this method to build 2 of our favorite parts (xx and XX). We did not encounter any particular difficulties.
STEP 1: PRIMER DESIGN
To this purpose you may find useful the GIBTHON tool designed by Cambridge iGEM team 2010. XX
STEP 2: PCR
If you used the Phusion method with HF buffer, to PCR out your gene, ther ei sno need of purification.
Quantify each product preferably by gel.
STEP 3: ASSEMBLY
We used the NEB Gibson kit (E2611).
Master Mix 10µL

The saturation level is 10-6mole/L  in which concentration or higher the bacteria’s movements to chemoattractant are less efficient. In addition, the relation between chemoreceptor concentration and the lower threshold and staturation level were also studied (Figure 5).
The quantity that links the CheY-p concentration with the type of motion (run vs. tumble) is called bias. It is defined as the fraction of time spent on the directed movement with respect to the total movement time. The relative concentration  of CheYp is converted into motor bias using a Hill function (Euqation 1)[5]. A graph describes bias against CheY-p concentration was shown in Figure 5.

2. Simulation of chemotaxis of bacteria population
In chemotaxis, receptors sensing an increase in the concentration of chemoattractant send a signal that suppresses tumbling, and, simultaneously, the receptor becomes more highly methylated. Conversely, a decrease in the chemoattractant concentration increases the tumble frequency and causes receptor demethylation. The tumbling frequency is approximately 1 Hertz, and decreased to almost zero as he bacteria move up a chemtoatic gradient [5].
In the model, the bacteria should be able compare the chemoattractant concentration at current point to the concentration at previous second. If the concentration decreases (i.e. C_t1-C_t2  ≤0), the bacteria will tumble with frequency 1 Hertz. If the concentration increases (C_t1-C_t2  >0), the tumble frequency decreases, and hence the probability of tumbling decreases. From equation 10 in ref [6], we known that even if C_t1-C_t2  >0, the probability of tumbling could decreases to 39%. Therefore, we can conclude the above description into the following statement [8]:
2.1. Chemotaxis of bacteria population under laboratory conditions
Under laboratory condition, the chemoattractant diffuses from the source, hence the distribution pattern of chemoattratctant changes with time. In this case, error function (Equation 2"

2. trBamA, trOmpA, trIgA - Transcription rate.
Transcription rate of T7 RNA polymerase is approximately 60 nucleotides per second [2]. Length of each gene was 2430 nucleotides for BamA, 1038 nucleotides for OmpA, and 945 nucleotides for lgA. Transcription rate per minute for each gene was calculated:
trBamA = (60/2430)∗60 = 1.48 mRNAs per minute
trOmpA = (60/1038)∗60 = 3.47 mRNAs per minute
trlgA = (60/945)∗60 = 3.81 mRNAs per minute
3. degmRNA BamA, degmRNA OmpA, degmRNA IgA - mRNA degradation rate.
Degradation rate is calculable from half-life using the formula: degX = ln(2)/halflife [3], where X shows the transcript of the target gene. Average mRNA half-life approximately is 5 minutes, however we screened half-lives of 1, 5, 10, and 15 minutes for each protein in order to more precisely evaluate the variability of the results. Degradation rates per minute were calculated:
1 minute half-life - 0.69 mRNAs per minute
5 minute half-life - 0.14 mRNAs per minute
10 minute half-life - 0.07 mRNAs per minute
15 minute half-life - 0.05 mRNAs per minute
4. trlBamA, trlOmpA, trlIgA - Protein translation rate.
Translation rate is about 20 amino acids per second [2]. Lengths of target proteins are 2430 nucleotides for BamA, 1038 nucleotides for OmpA, and 945 nucleotides for lgA. Translation rates per minute were calculated:
trlBamA = (20/810)∗60 = 1.48 proteins per minute
trlOmpA = (20/346)∗60 = 3.47 proteins per minute
trllgA = (20/315)∗60 = 3.81 proteins per minute

Offerings and Exit
Synbiologica is seeking funding that will be primarily directed towards research and development of BEAR, initial marketing of BEAR and networking.
Funds specifically used for research and development will be used to purchase and maintain laboratory equipment, purchase the necessary chemicals and reagents and hire laboratory technicians to assist in the development and testing of a viable prototype.
Investment money will be used to register for and travel to conferences and workshops the team will attend in order to develop our knowledge of business and the biotechnology and synthetic biology industries. This is important so the Synbiologica team can learn how to better integrate science with industry. These funds will also assist in travel to different research institutions when Synbiologica Ltd first begins to demonstrate the uses of BEAR to hormone researchers.
Synbiologica Ltd plans to spend 24 months in research and development as a viable prototype of BEAR is designed and patented. The company plans to rely on government grants and initial investment to fund this portion of the business’ development.
Synbiologica eventually plans to sell BEAR to one of the biotechnology companies to whom it had been licensed out. Profit from selling the product will be used to pay early investors, pay members of Synbiologica, and set aside as initial funding for Synbiologica’s future projects. At this point, Synbiologica cannot predict how much money BEAR will be sold for and how much money early investors will make back. The company needs to confer with people more experience with financials in order to accurately make these predictions. As BEAR expands to different possible assays it creates a current challenge in projecting the final value of the product and there for worth upon selling to investors.

UCL,2014,Team:UCL#Humans#Soci_-_-_TEXT.html," presumption that, from the environmentalist perspective, one could argue that their own strategy, indeed, does not dispose of the use of the chemical substance that causes mutagenic and carcinogenic activity in the first place. Notwithstanding that they are treating an ecological hazard that originates from industrial activity, team member Adam pointed out this contradiction in their project:
“I think our project is such quite a good example of how our environmentally-based project, that we always have our scientist hats on, [saying] “this is quite a good solution, that’s the best bacteria that can degrade azo dyes”, and the environmentalist would say “you are using azo dyes in the first place, a toxic compound, is there a better alternative we can use in dyeing textiles”? We always kind of forget that there’s more and more to solve a problem”.
The emphasis here lies on the fact that the team acknowledges that their solution does not meet the requirements of the ecologically-modern society. It is also the nature of the problem that adds a constraining factor to how solutions can be devised. Some of the team members illustrated this by making a metaphorical analogy with the medical sciences:
[Tanel] “This is an honest problem where you notice the problem and then you look at it…”
[Adam] “…Are we treating the symptoms of the disease or the disease itself”?
[Georgia] “Yeah, but the disease is just so awesome”.
[Daniel] “The disease is incurable I would say in our case”.
Looking for the better solution which would engender the necessary institutional reform to ‘ecologise’ the economy, is something that all team members evidently would prefer. However, as a matter of pragmatic concern, organisational constraints necessitate an intermediate pathway for UCL iGEM 2014 to solve the azo dye problem, while others would rather say that the nature of the issue is insurmountable:
[Daniel] ‘I mean it would great, it would be fun if natural dyes, even awesome, to stick to clothes very tightly and – but the thing is right now azo dyes are worth 70 per cent of all dye production in textile, cosmetics. They constitute the whole basis of how we understand fashion and cosmetic industry and maybe we should aim to change that, but thing is, the problem is there are right now and I think the chances to reconvert the whole industry are very low so at least we are tackling the problem derived from the use of azo dyes’.
[Philipp] ‘So your argument would be, put simply, there"

Clorobiocin blocks the ATP-binding site of bacterial gyrase subunit B (GyrB). The high sequence similarity between the ATP-binding site of GyrB and human topoisomerase II leads to blocking of the ATP binding site of human topoisomerase II rendering clorobiocin toxic to humans. Our aim was to improve the binding characteristics of our aminocoumarin in a way that it selectively binds GyrB but not the human topoisomerase II. A second advancement is that we use a β-lactam ring to make it specific to organisms that have a  β-lactamase, like MRSA. The docking poses of our new, activated aminocoumarin (with cleaved lactam ring) with GyrB (PDB:1KZN) scored better than novobiocin and clorobiocin indicating a higher affinity to our target protein.
Figure 1: Interaction diagram between the activated aminocoumarin and the binding pocket of Gyrase B (1KZN)
Next, we compared the binding affinity of a novobiocin-resistant variant of GyrB to our newly synthesized aminocoumarin. The activated aminocoumarin is differently positioned in the crystal structure (PDB:1AJ6) than novobiocin and showed better binding indicating that it is even effective against the resistant variant.
Figure 2: Interaction diagram between novobiocin and the binding pocket of Gyrase B (1AJ6)
Figure 3: Interaction diagram between the activated aminocoumarin and the binding pocket of Gyrase B (1AJ6)
The inactivated form of our antibiotic (lactam ring closed) was also docked in a reverse orientation in the ATP binding site of the off-target human topoisomerase II (PDB:1ZXM). The unforeseeable consequences for binding potentially render it ineffective in the human cell.

On Tuesday morning, the team met at UES where they discussed various points of action that would allow them to accomplish their goal of the cinnamaldehyde and chitinase producing bacteria. Peter, Chris, and Travis worked on researching as many forms of chitinase as possible and searching for the DNA sequences of each chitinase. Max began research on the pathways of cinnamaldehyde production and how to piece together to the three genes from the iGEM registry and which ribosomal binding sites to use.

The iGEM students of the RX lab began their day at UES.  They checked their work of the previously completed DNA sequences and made adjustments.  The entire team including RH then had a skype conversation with the New Deli iGEM team from India.  After this conversation, the RX team then proceeded to head to RX in order to meet with Chia.  At RX, Chia taught the students an in-depth method of how they were to use restriction site within their experiments and DNA sequence.  He then gave the team further guidance of how to correct their DNA sequences.  Back at UES, the RX team then split up into their various different tasks: Chris downloaded software onto the UES laptop and worked on the logo. Peter fixed the DNA sequences of the chitinases and sent them to Chia and then worked on designing the logo. Travis began work on the safety forms with Yazmin with the help of Tina, Dallas, and Andrea.

Exploring the emotions that people feel towards phage therapy through a representative sample video
13th of August 2018
Introduction
This report intends to explore what emotions people feel towards phage therapy. To get a representative sample, we found a very popular phage video on YouTube, entitled, “The Deadliest Being on Planet Earth- The Bacteriophage”. This video had 5.7 million views and to understand how people felt about phage therapy, we analysed 13,995 comments as a representative sample of 23,984 comments.1 By processing the comments in a program, we were able to pair comments to emojis. These emojis indicated feelings towards phage therapy in clear and easy to understand symbols. Several key emotion themes quickly emerged, and we have contextualised these emojis in relation to phage therapy below:
😷 Face with Medical Mask
This emoji is defined as a person who wears a surgical mask to avoid sickness or spreading disease.2 In the phage therapy context, this is an anomaly from the remaining emotion themes. This is because rather than reflecting an emotion, this emoji reflects debate and discussion about the medical benefits and risks of phage therapy. Example comments such as, “Utilizing viruses specifically to evolved to kill such bacteria is a viable option” and “This really is great! Our worst virus problem is the HIV phage!” demonstrate how some feel incredibly positive and view phage therapy as something with many potential benefits. However, it is also important to note that this emoji also symbolises discussion towards the risks of phage therapy. Comments such as, “What stops the virus from (eventually) evolving to attack human cells?” and, “Another idiotic gamble that could do the job the globalist want, to kill off mankind down to 500,000,000” highlight this. Overall, this emoji indicates that there is so much debate and discussion regarding the medical benefits and risks of phage therapy"

In other hand, to restrict the bacterial invasion, the yeast is made to produce Lypd8, a protein represses the move of bacterial by binding to the flagella. Moreover, we decide to use a cold shock kill switch to avoid the escape of our chassis to the environment and more supporting modules will be added if necessary. We hope these modules will incorporate into a functional system eventually. Integrating probiotic therapy with synthetic biology, we envision that the collaboration between the firemen and the policemen will greatly help us to overcome the tough situation in the patient’s gut.

9:31: Team 1 update. They’ve been working on getting EV131 out of pBlueScript. But when they ran the gels they didn’t see 2 bands. On Friday they ran a bunch of controls, will be running gels today.
9:36: Gary suggests to test the viability of the frozen cells. Also, we should test the primers to make sure the DNA sequence is in there. Also issues with the ladder….? The band might be there but not as bright because it’s less DNA. Or we could cut something to make the desired piece of DNA bigger. The 2 restriction enzymes are compatible.
9:42: Plan for the week… Let’s say the digest works. Extract the band, put it into pGEM. Start PCR. pGEM is only for PCRing. Then if that works successfully place into pNoTat expression vector. Still looking into binding assays for EV131.
9:45: Gary: Look at the reading frame! Look at the pNoTat sequence – look at where restriction site is relative to EV131 codon.

We, in turn, suggested some solutions for the adjustment of proper temperature for cyanobacteria in their CO2 incubator.
Tart_TUIT Estonia iGEM Team
We started our collaboration with Tart_TUIT iGEM Team from an Interlab study during which we tried to help each other to verify the final results. Later, our collaboration expanded to the discussion of our projects through the Skype meeting, where we could share ideas about different aspects of the competition and suggest some improvements on the current issues.
San Diego high school team
We have arranged a Skype meeting with a CCA-San Diego high school team , during which we shortly presented our projects. Since both our of our projects were related to bioremediation of oil products and production of hydrogen gas, we suggested them possible methods for hydrogen gas detection and quantification. This team has truly cheered us up with their enthusiasm and the collaboration went mutually productive.
Thessaloniki iGEM Team
The collaboration included answering a survey about synthetic biology, laboratory work, safety and ethics that was addressed to experienced scientists working on the synthetic biology field .

Purified and assembled (for Pf ferritin and DPS, detailed assembly protocol can be found in Method ) proteins were incubated overnight with 100mM hydrazine, respectively, and hydrazine leftover was measured by adding 4-Dimethylaminobenzaldehyde and HCl to the system (for detailed protocol, see Method ). Sample N2H4·H2SO4 exhibited apparent color change and UV absorption at 454nm after such reaction (Figure 1). Significant decrease of hydrazine concentration was observed after overnight incubation with all 6 proteins. However, since CuCl2 was added in culture medium of CueO-expressing bacteria to help correct folding, and Cu2+ alone exhibited considerable catalytic activity, it was hard to measure the catalytic activity of CueO. As for urease, additional experiments showed that it was not as efficient as Pf ferritin and DPS (Figure 3). Therefore, we stopped with these two enzymes and focused on the other 4 proteins.
https://static.igem.org/mediawiki/2017/7/7d/T--UCAS--Degradation_Fig1.png
We tested the catalytic kinetics of 3His, Degrado, Pf ferritin and DPS and found that the most efficient one was Pf ferritin (Figure 4). Unfortunately, even though Pf ferritin was already the most effcicient candidate for Hydrazine Dehydrogenase (HDH), it took about an hour to reduce the concentration of hydrazine from 100uM to 50Um, which was far from efficient in general sense. In future, we will introduce point mutations into these proteins to improve their catalytic efficiency, find more multiheme proteins and test their N2H4-oxidation activity, and try to express codon-optimized HDH in E. coli.

We cast our sight on AmoA, a membrane protein in Anammox, which was anticipated to transform ammonia into hydroxylamine. E. coli bearing AmoA was incubated overnight with 1mM NH4Cl at 37°C in a shaker. Since AmoA is a copper-containing protein, 100uM CuCl2 was added to the medium.

Phillip's notes:
Introduction:  For today, colony PCR will be done in order to verify the Yeate construct.  In addition, ampicillin plates will be made in preparation for beginning protein expression in the next few days.  Much of it will be limited to what is possible to work with in the boelter lab..
Resuspension of Oligos:
Resuspension, Dilution, Storage, and Other Tips
After receiving an envelope containing their order of newly synthesized IDT oligonucleotides, many researchers find themselves asking the question “Now what should I do with these oligos?” At this point, several important decisions must be made regarding oligonucleotide resuspension, dilution, and storage, which may vary depending on the intended application for each oligo. Here, we provide recommendations for preparing oligos to use in experiments and guidelines for proper storage.
Resuspension
Centrifugation and Resuspension. Most oligonucleotides synthesized and shipped from IDT are delivered dried down and often appear as a white flakey substance in the bottom of the tube. Dried DNA is quite stable and, typically, is easy to resuspend in an aqueous solution. The first step a researcher should take upon receipt of their oligos is to briefly centrifuge the tubes before opening them. This ensures that any dried DNA that may have become dislodged during shipping is brought down to the bottom of the tube. Next, the oligos should be resuspended in TE buffer (IDTE: 10 mM Tris, 0.1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0). Tris (tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane) acts as a buffer, helping to maintain a constant pH for the solution. EDTA (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid) prevents nuclease digestion of the DNA. At higher concentrations, EDTA can inhibit enzymatic reactions, such as PCR, by chelating metals ions like Mg2"

This week, the captains held check-ins with each individual on the team to hear concerns and alleviate worries, since we are now halfway through the summer. While the captains were busy with meetings, the rest of the team was working hard as always. Our modeling team started a growth curve for Yarrowia lipolytica so we can better understand the yeast’s growth rate, our riboswitch team began lab work, our plasmid team started linearizing plasmids, and our outreach team continued to update the wiki page and started creating a presentation for high schoolers.
Four of our team members and our PI took a vacation to Minneapolis that wasn’t much of a vacation at all. The small group toured Medtronic's Operational Headquarters, Physiological Research Laboratories, and the University of Minnesota's Visible Heart Lab. Almost every other second of the trip was spent on the BMES Coulter College Conference, which required teams to come up with a medical solution to a need. Our team focused on hypertension in resource-constrained settings and developed a solution in the form of a blood-pressure-monitoring phone case and app. Even after the conference, the fivesome was hard at work; they met with the University of Minnesota iGEM team, toured their lab, and gave advice about human practices, outreach, and fundraising.
The first step to prepare for Gibson Assembly was to linearize pUC19 and pXRL2 via PCR. We performed PCR Over the course of this week we had bands in strange and random locations. We were led to believe our plasmids were not what we believed them to be. Eventually it was discovered that we were using an incorrect amount of Q5 2x master mix which caused the PCR to not work properly.
During the first lab week, we rehydrated our gene blocks from IDT and performed overlap extension (OE) PCR on three of the genes (delta7, ADR, and FDX1). We used touch-down and touch-up thermocycler settings which resulted in many different sized bands on an agarose gel. To reduce the amount of nonspecific primer annealing in these reactions"

Thanks to their suggestions, we attained a more comprehensive understanding of the practical conditions and improved our own project.
Mingxian HUANG
Editor of the official account of China Aquaculture Website:
We interviewed Mingxiang Huang, the editor of the official account of China Aquaculture Website, the largest online aquatic products market and the communication platform of fish raisers.
Key point
The water pollution is severe in China, and aquaculture waste water contributes a lot to the ammonia-nitrogen pollution.
The current methods of ammonia-nitrogen degradation are circulating stagnant water and using activated sludge.
Administration and proper guidance is needed for fish raisers in the rural area.
It is important to concern about bio-safety when applying engineered bacteria to ponds.
The information and suggestion we obtained from this interview inspired us to go to synthetic biology for help. We expect to use genetically engineered bacterium to solve this problem. Let’s find a solution to detect and degrade ammonia-nitrogen pollution in a cheap and easy way!
Zhisheng YU
Professor of Energy and Environmental Microbiology in UCAS
In order to customize our project to practical conditions, we interviewed Zhisheng YU, professor of Energy and Environmental Microbiology in University of Chinese Academy of Sciences.

It is important to concern about bio-safety when applying engineered bacteria to ponds.
Prof. YU raised up many issues that we had never concerned before and inspired us to think more comprehensively. Let’s divide the detection part and the degradation part, and do more things on bio-safety!
Mr. XU
Technician of Yancheng Cheng Dong foul water purifying factory
Does the use of bacteria in water purification have any reference meaning to the degradation of ammonia in fish pond? We interviewed Mr. XU to find out the answer.
Key point
Activated sludge which is cultivated by their workers has been used in the factory.
There is not a full-blown industry in China for cultivating bacteria strains that can purify the water
A low-cost device to detect and degrade nitrogen will be very useful.
They advised us to pay more attention on engineering and application.

Waste Assays
These assays were designed to test whether our chassis could grow either directly with waste and/or in waste conditioned media. Waste conditioned media is a filter sterilised version of the waste media and was designed for several reasons; we were unsure whether mixed waste would be toxic to Ecoli and hence a less concentrated version may be more suitable and secondly large chunks of waste would prevent accurate OD600 measurements and therefore we decided to filter out the largest chunks.
Waste media
We can see from this experiment whether our bacteria can grow solely on the mixed waste.
(A) Waste media(B) Ecoli containing mCherry stress biosensor (BBa_K639003) were grown in mixed waste (A) over 3 days, then streaked in a qualitative assay to check for growth. (C) mCherry stress biosensor (BBa_K639003) transformed Ecoli were streaked again after 7 days growth in SRF.
(A) waste media made up in PBS (phosphate buffered saline). (B) E coli expressing mCherry stress biosensor (BBa_K639003) grown in waste media (A) over 3 days, then streaked onto an antibiotic containing plate to qualitatively assess whether the E. coli had survived. (C) Streaked again after 6 days growth in SRF.
Conclusion MG1655 can survive solely on mixed waste.

The random distribution may also lead to the                                 signal delay, which inspire                                 hot discussion among our team members. These considerations give us more possibility.
Since there is no antibiotics employed in our project,                                 the company’s manager affirmed our potential use in large-scale production.
What’s more, since our project has potential to be applied and has the obvious                                     advantage of no antibiotics employed, COFCO provided us with some financial help.
HP Union
In the Asia-Pacific conference, we greatly enlarged our horizons by sharing                                 ideas to other teams at the same time, we feel it’s not enough and it’s                                 necessary and urgent to establish a platform for teams’ interactive communication. That’s the first beginning of our HP union.
The first step is to build a Wechat official account to communicate with other                                 teams and propagandize                                 to the public. This way, we can investigate and get feedback from the public easily.
We lead the HP union and start the union with other five teams: BIT, CGU-Taiwan,                                 Jilin-China, Peking, TJU. So far, more teams up to 10 are members of the union.
And we had () user paying attention to the account.
We shared some articles about synthetic biology to the account referring to                                 issues about biological safety, ethics, iGEM competition and other general topics.
Besides, we plan to provide new teams or the potential participated                                     teams with resources including union members’ project introduction and team members’ personal                                 contact information attached with attribution.                                 This way, it can facilitate the communication among students.
Conferences
In August, 2016, BIT-China was invited to take part in the Asia-Pacific                                 conference held by team NCKU-Tainan. About 20 teams participated in the                                 conference, and all of them made splendid speeches to                                 present their own projects, from which we got to know plenty of exciting ideas.
We also presented our project, and received lots of feedback to improve our design.                                 As the first one to present, the Q and A section of our team were under                                 hot discussion. The questions raised refer to not only the project design,                                 but also extend to considerations about safety issues.                                 We also realized the importance of oral presentation from the questions.
In addition to this, we held and took part in several exchange                                 meetings with other four teams: Peking, Jilin-China, UCAS.                                 Through these exchange meetings, we got many useful suggestions                                 to shape our project step by step.

dDrawing Abs600-time curve under different inducers
The population and growth condition can be reflected by Abs600, so through the curve of Abs600-time, the effect of CbeA and CbtA towards bacteria can be displayed. ( read more in protocol )
1. CbtA function validation: L-Arabinose was added into TA group bacteria to induce the expression of CbtA and Abs600 values were measured along culturing. The Abs600-time curve was drawn according to the values. To exclude the impact of L-arabinose towards bacteria, we used the vector group as the control.
2. CbeA function validation: IPTG was added into TA group bacteria to induce the expression of CbeA and Abs600 values were measured along culturing. The Abs600-time curve was drawn according to the values. To exclude the impact of IPTG towards bacteria, we used the vector group as the control.
3. The recovering effect of CbeA towards CbtA validation: L-Arabinose was added into TA and vector groups bacteria to induce the expression of CbtA. After the bacteria displayed poisoning features, IPTG was added. Abs600 values were measured along culturing. The Abs600-time curve was drawn according to the values. To exclude the impact of inducers towards bacteria, we used the vector group as the control.
Cellular morphology observation
Two significant changes will happen when Geneguard takes effect. One is the delaying in bacterial growth, the other one is transformation in bacterial morphology. The two experiments we designed above certified geneguard's function through delaying in bacterial growth. We also wanted to demonstrate it through transformation in bacterial morphology. However, we lacked appropriate equipment for observation. Thus, we seek help from our partner NKU( read more ). We designed the morphology experiment according to our pervious work. Groups of control, 0.2% arabinose induction, 0.2% arabinose and IPTG co-induction were set. Bacterial morphology was observed in 1.5, 3 and 6 hrs.
Results and Discussion
plate streaking and colony growth observation
Result:The results show that addition of arabinose, leading to the expression of toxin, can greatly suppress the growth of bacteria. In the contrary, the addition of IPTG or both inducers show no significant effect, which confirm that the expression of antitoxin can relieve the suppression"

They became more concentrated on class, more and more students revel in synthetic biology, they began to think about the use of synthetic biology, even asked us something about synthetic biology experiment. They also talked about their ideas such as regeneration of human limbs, changes in sweetness of vegetables, and the integration of multiple biological genes on the same organism. Although these ideas may not be able to achieve, they have the willingness to use synthetic biology"
Heidelberg,2015,Team:Heidelberg#Overview_-_-_TEXT.html," has the capability of self-cleavage. A HHR consists of three stems of which one is open. The complementary region of this open stem can be designed so that the HHR cleaves off a customized sequence without leaving a scar
Meyer2014
. (Click for design guide) This makes it a valuable tool in the work with functional RNA as it leaves defined 5’- or 3’-ends after cleavage that are essential for some applications.
Balke2014
Another ribozyme that is related to the HHR is the hepatitis δ virus ribozyme (HDV).
Sharmeen1988
In contrast to the HHR it cleaves itself off a RNA at a specific position without a recognition site and without leaving a scar. This advantage of being independent from an upstream sequence makes it widely applicable and thus is used in our new BBF RFC 110 that aims to simplify and standardize the use of functional RNA.
Figure 2. Hairpin Ribozyme
Naturally occurring Hairpin Ribozyme with cleavage site indicated by arrow.
Both of the mentioned types of ribozymes are found in satellite RNA of plant origin
Serganov2007
as does the so called hairpin ribozyme (Fig. 2). It is a ribozyme capable of cleaving and ligating a RNA complementary to itself.
Buzayan1986
While researchers were looking for naturally occurring ribozymes, they developed methods to in vitro evolve the function of existing ribozymes and to discover new ones from random pools.
Beaudry1992
This way scientists were able to establish catalytic systems with new function. For example Joyce developed a self-replicating system consisting of two hairpin-ribozyme-derived parts that replicate each other.
Lam2009
Lincoln2009
Our idea of working with functional nucleic acids originated from this system. We were fascinated by the vast variety of processes that they can perform and started digging deeper into the potential of nucleic acids as tools. During this process we came across interesting systems amongst which we found the twin ribozyme (Fig. 3). Another famous hairpin-ribozyme-derived functional nucleic acid developed by Müller.
Schmidt2000

In order to let more people know about synthetic biology and the competition of iGEM, We not only held several campaigns between other Taiwanese iGEM teams, we also established a Blog ( http://igemntuadmin.blogspot.tw/ ) and a Facebook page ( http://www.facebook.com/NationalTaiwanUniversityiGEM ) for publics around the world. All Facebook (FB) users have free access to this page. This is one of the attempts We made to promote the visibility of synthetic biology during general public and students of all ages. In order to increase accessibility, we translated the journal article to traditional Chinese. All the articles were posted in traditional Chinese, too. We summited articles about latest advances in synthetic biology and fields relating to iGEM, in a routine schedule, usually two to three articles per week. In sum, we had posted more than 30 articles form July, 2012. The content not only includes latest journal articles sharing, our iGEM NTU_Taida project, the detail process of how we establish our team and the cooperating meetings between us and iGEM team NYMU_Taipei, NCTU_Formosa ,two teams from Taiwan and another team in USA, UIUC-Illinois.

Evry,2015,Team:Evry#Project#Chassis_-_-_TEXT.html," (19). Tumor antigen MART-1 was also expressed in yeast cytosol and induced both CD4+ and CD8+ in mice. (20)
D. S. cerevisiae prior immunization with the wild type do not create a response neutralizing the antigen expressing yeast, allowing repeated injections of the vector. (21)
Surface display of tumor antigen for CD8+ cross-priming
We chose to express our antigen on the membranes of S. cerevisiae because surface displayed antigen is cross-presented much more efficiently than yeast cytosol antigen (22). This is due to a particular kinetics inside the early phagosome, allowing the external antigen to escape from the phagosome. Cross-presentation can be further enhanced by inserting linkers susceptible to Cathepsin S cleavage between the antigen and Aga2p, supporting the evidence that early antigen release is important for cross-presentation (22).
Enhancing cross-priming with the antibody anti-DEC205
Our surface display antigen for ovalbumin was fused to DEC205 scFv. DEC205 is a lectin receptor expressed by some DCs subsets, including mouse spleen DC (23). It was shown that antibody targeting DEC-205, fused to tumor antigen, can induce T cell stimulation if administered with an additional stimulus triggering DC maturation, like anti-CD40 agonistic antibody (24). In the same way, immunization with DNA vectors encoding antigens fused to a DEC-205 scFv elicits a strong specific CD8+ responses in vivo (25).
The scFv of DEC205 was fused to our ovalbumin tumor antigen and surface displayed in order to get the yeast internalized in a DC endosome through DEC205 receptor, favoring CD8+ cross-presentation. We used the scFv instead of the whole antibody for the possibility to perform repeated immunisations without inducing deleterious host responses against the Fc part of the immunoglobulin chains.
Advantages of yeast expressing DEC205 over DEC205 protein vaccines
Pure protein vaccines with DEC205 are far less immunogenic than vaccine with micro-organisms mimicking pathogens and request an additional adjuvant. Moreover, the protein needs a prior step of antigen purification (26), leading us to develop this yeast surface display of DEC205 scFv fused to the antigen. The advantages of our system include better concentration of the yeast due to less diffusion than the protein DEC205 alone, the codelivery of both antigen and adjuvant, the possibility to target multiple DCs compartments at the same time (MHCI and MHC"

Explore SynthetINK
Our Project: SynthetINK
Most people fail to realize just how expensive, and environmentally detrimental current inks and its production methods are. For instance, the pigment Carbon Black is produced by the combustion of petroleum, leading to a great release of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gasses into the atmosphere. As well, modern ink production methods involve mining for minerals and harvesting large amounts of plants. This process produces large amounts of Volatile Organic Compounds, more commonly known as VOC’s, which are harmful to the environment. Looking to the price, current inks found in markets range from $0.53 to $3.40.The price of ink can even be compared to that of Chanel no.5 perfume, which costs anywhere from $2.50 to $3.30. In addition to this, ink companies are known to spend billions of dollars per year for testing and manufacturing ink products. It is simple to see why current ink production methods should change.
SynthetINK is our solution to these harmful effects of ink production. We are producing pigments in the bacteria Escherichia coli, using four constructs to create four different pigments in bacteria that will be extracted from the cells using an organic extraction. Following extraction, the ink will be placed into a fountain pen as a proof of concept.The pigment will be able to be used in a variety of applications, such as paint, printers, and textiles.
Looking into the human practices aspect of the project, our team has planned for a number of interviews to be conducted throughout the course of the season. We have interviewed a few experts in the industry and they have stated that they would be very interested in using our project in their businesses. We have also hosted a parent-teacher night to spread synthetic biology aspects to the community, as well as to display our project. Besides this, we intend to create a mathematical model of the growth of our bacteria and the expression of the genes and pigments produced.
Our hope is to successfully produce an ink at the end of the season to be showcased to the world.
Environmental Impact
With SynthetINK, our primary focus is a drastically reduced environmental footprint compared to modern ink"

We want to use genetic engineering technology, gene cloning Slps, design of controlled Slps operon gene expression, to build them into the expression vector, recombinant plasmid, electricity into a receptor in bifidobacterium, testing after transforming of bifidobacteria in vivo and in vitro resistance, adhesion and live action, in order to get more colonization ability of bifidobacterium, solve the disadvantage of low utilization rate of foreign probiotic bacteria in the body, make foreign probiotic bacteria in the body better able to play a role.
Community Class
Our team organized a community class for children to introduce our iGEM team and the microorganism on our bodies, especially on our feet. For the beginning, we listed some common microorganism, and differed the beneficial from the harmful. Next, our team gave a presentation about our iGEM project. At last, some children who behaved actively got microscopes as gifts.
The class attracted many children and their parents. In the class, kids gained the microorganism knowledge and had an initial understanding of synthetic biology which they showed a strong interest in. Some kids even said they wanted to be one of us in the future. Sincerely, we hope their dreams come true one day.
After the class, the parents and the children asked lots of questions related to genetic engineering and synthetic biology. Our team members explained to them patiently, and our project got a wide recognition.
As believed, genetic engineering is one of the most exciting areas in contemporary science and technology, and synthetic biology will definitely do more and more for our life. We hoped to do our bits to raise the children’s awareness about the subjects and encourage them to be curious in biology, particularly in genetic engineering and synthetic biology.
Teach-in for Freshmen
Right after the beginning of this semester, we held a teach-in for the freshmen in the College of Life Science of Sichuan University.
This teach-in was hosted by the team SCU_China. First, we introduced the origin of iGEM and synthetic biology in front of over 200 students who attended, then the contents of the iGEM competition (about the experiments, hardware design and modeling). We then shared our feeling about what wonderful experience iGEM brought to us, and how we practiced our ability of doing research from students ‘perspective. At last, we talked about the project"

After a few weeks of editing the protocol, a final procedure was developed for the Shewanella growth assay . The results of the most successful experiment are shown below, with an OD600 minimum of 0.06 reached for all three samples, with the sample appearing to still be on the rise. Therefore, a steady flow of 2% (w/v) sodium lactate could likely keep the cells alive and functioning for a long period of time in the reactor, though more testing will be needed to completely verify this claim.
Fig. 1. Growth as OD600 over time is plotted for a 96 well-plate inoculated with engineered strain S. oneidensis Sal1 growing on 2% sodium lacate in Synthetic River Media. Three trials of the same strain are shown  supporting an average OD600 of 0.098 (σ=0.034).

Offering equipment and reagent
Although we have more than two well equipped laboratories in the Institute of Biophysics (IBP, CAS) where we can carry out our experiments, we have to spend 3 hours commuting between IBP and our campus. Thanks to BNDS_China, who generously provided us with some equipment we do not have on campus, we managed to finish some of our experiment without wasting time on the subway. We also want to thank BIT-China. They generously provided us with 4 liters of Methanol for HPLC-MS testing during National Day vacation when we were out of stock and all our suppliers were off work, which facilitated the progress of our experiments.
Safe Project Design
Aimed at dealing with excessive ammonia in the fish pond, we engineered our bacteria to detect and degrade ammonia. To ensure the safety of our project, we chose E. coli (TOP10 strain for detection, BL21 strain for degradation and DH5α for InterLab) as our project chassis, which is of group 1 risk. Although we introduce resistance genes into our circuits, they are the ones that commonly used in the lab and have been widely confirmed to be safe.
For ammonia detection, we also designed a device to apply our bacteria into practical use, of which safety is of crucial value. We used filter to isolate the component that will contact with bacteria from other components of the device and open environment. Afterwards, we have a complete decontamination protocol to deal with our engineered bacteria and the component of the device that contact the bacteria.
For ammonia degradation, we have successfully expressed all the enzymes we need in E. coli. However, considering the harm E. coli can do to aquatic creatures, our engineered bacteria will not be directly released into fish ponds. Instead, we planned to replace our chassis with other harmless bacteria such as B.subtilis now that our concept has been proved success in E. coli.
Safe Laboratory Work
Lab Safety Rules
We have already completed and submitted the safety form. We guarantee to follow the safety rules provided by iGEM in our lab work. Besides, we have safety rules in our lab as well. We separate the experimenting area and living area apart, no experimental material is allowed in living area and no living item is allowed in experimenting area. When we do experiments, we strictly follow the protocol and are monitored by the lab manager.
Safe Parts
In detection part, we transformed three different promotors and a RFP gene into E. coli and in degradation part, we transformed some enzymes in purine metabolic pathway into our engineered bacteria. Therefore, no toxic matters will"

SUSTC-Shenzhen-B,2013,Team:SUSTC-Shenzhen-B#publicity.html_-_-_TEXT.html," we finally had a common view of cooperation in synthetic biology in the future.
The public course was just the same as we had in Shenzhen Experimental Senior High. Later, we had a very cheerful conversation with their teachers that they tried our software and we decided to have a cooperation of popularizing synthetic biology in their school in the future. That’s a big step of popularizing synthetic biology in Shenzhen, because they are the best high school here, and they can lead other schools to know and learn about synthetic biology.
SUSTC freshmen
In Sep 11th, we had a public course in our university. The public course was still the same as we had two High Schools, including history of synthetic biology, the basic idea and knowledge of synthetic biology, how we can build a new circuit, the safety and humanity of this new subject and iGEM competition.
What’s more, we gave these interested students a course about the details of experiment and knowledge, and we invited our professors, He Jiankui, to give them more guiding. Of course, we let some freshmen join our team, in order to let them know the working environment of iGEM and cultivated them to be the leader of next year.
Open course online
This year we invited our advisor Qie Boyu to upload a new open course about interesting synthetic biology to YouTube. This video could let rookies be more interested in synthetic biology and iGEM. And we made the open course livelier and easier to understand. So we believe that more and more people who have watched our video would develop an interest in iGEM and synthetic biology.
Brochure
In order to let more people know about synthetic biology, we made a brochure about synthetic biology and gave out it to citizens in various occasions. Many students and teachers who have read our brochure showed that they wanted to join in this amazing world. And we have used two different languages so that the foreigners in Shenzhen can also understand it without any problems.

Lambert_GA,2018,Team:Lambert GA#Measurement_-_-_TEXT.html," store the detected circles
The 6 by 6 grid located underneath the first row can be loaded with experimental samples and a percentage value can be determined on a scale from the negative control to the positive control. The circle detection process loops through until the maximum radius reaches 120 pixels. If anywhere from 35 to 40 circles are detected in total, then the loop stops. However, if there are fewer circles detected, then the loops restarts to finish through the maximum radius until anywhere from 25 to 40 circles are detected properly. If less than 25 circles are detected, then an error is caught and another picture is requested to be used. Zooming in or zooming out could possibly make the circle detection process easier for the system and more efficient. The following formula is used to calculate the relative percentage values:
The results are then displayed based upon the row in which the circles fall in on the base of the Chrome Q hardware. The app is able to determine the row in which the circles fall in by comparing y-coordinates. If the y-values are similar to each other, then the circles are classified as being on the same row. The relative values are then transferred to another page within the app where the user is able to enter information that could help contribute to our machine learning model, CALM. The application uses the latitude, longitude, and timestamp values obtained from the phone's GPS to effectively determine where and when the test was run. When the user submits the data, the results are sent to a MySQL database, which is a part of the Relational Database Service (RDS) as a part of the Amazon Web Services (AWS) platform. Refer to Discussion under CALM for further information.

Vilnius-Lithuania,2018,Team:Vilnius-Lithuania-OG#ProteinGAN_-_-_TEXT.html,",0001 for discriminator and generator (β1 = 0, β2 = 0,9). Both discriminator and generator were trained the same amount of steps.
ProteinGAN Architecture details
ProteinGAN networks are comprised of residual blocks that showed the best performance in ImageNet challenges. They are also a widely adopted in various implementation of GANs. Each block in discriminator contains 3 convolution layers with filter size of 3x3. The generator residual blocks consist of two deconvolution layers (transposed convolution) and one convolution block with the same filter size of 3x3 (see Figure 6).
Figure 6. Residual Blocks
We have experimented with 3 up-sampling techniques: Nearest Neighbor, Transposed Convolutions (deconvolutions)  and Sub-Pixel Convolutions (Shi et al., 2016). After conducting numerous experiments, we have chosen Transposed Convolutions as the best suited for dealing with proteins.
Figure 7: Architecture of generator and discriminator
The addition of Dilation into ProteinGAN
Convolution filters are very good at detecting local features, but it has limitations when it comes to long distance relationship. As a result, a lot of deep learning algorithms uses RNN (Recurrent Neural Network) approach when it comes to sequences. However, it has been showed that convolution filters with dilation outperforms RNN (Bai, Kolter and Koltun, 2018). The idea of dilation is to increase receptive field without increasing the number of parameters by introducing gaps into convolution kernels (Figure 8). Dilation rate was applied to one convolution filter in each residual block. The dilation rate was increased by 2 in each consecutive block. In this way by the last layer of the network, filters had large enough receptive field to learn long-distance relationships.
Figure 8: (a) dilation rate equals 1 (standard convolution), (b) dilation rate equals 2, (c) dilation rate equals 4. Red dots are where 3x3 filter is applied, colored squares show receptive field given previous convolutions. Source: (Yu and Koltun, 2016)
Self-Attention
Different areas of protein have different responsibilities in overall protein behaviour. In order to for network to capture this, self-attention mechanism (Zhang et al., 2018) has been implemented. To put it simply, it is a number of layers that highlights different areas of importance across the entire sequence. There are 64 such filters in ProteinGAN and ReactionGAN implementations.

HZAU-China,2014,Team:HZAU-China#Humanities#ethics_-_-_TEXT.html," existing organisms? Synthetic biologists, or the bio-engineers, take what they think is better from other organisms and engineer it into the target organism. This is molding the nature according to a certain subconscious standard: perfection, whether it is virtually reached or not.
     Because of this, there is the issue of ""playing God"" that has already been discussed by many.[8][9]
     When I first learned of this word, I wondered why people make it sound so sacrilegious. We all want to imitate our idols, don’t we? If the Cosmos Will that resembles God is cosplayed by a bunch of scientists, shouldn’t he feel pleased? Because this is proof that he has become the true model of the human beings so much that people want to imitate him! Though then I realized that the synthetic biologists were not imitating God by intention, they are just doing what their logic and inspirations and creative nerves tell them to do.
     But then again, it reminds me of the Old Testament, the story of God and Lucifer, and it is astounding how similar the claim sounds. God created Lucifer, the prime angel, the most perfect being, one which God loves the most. And he gives Lucifer something like freewill, that’s when Lucifer got out of control. He “ wants to be like the most high.”[10] i.e. he wants to rise above the will of God. Qur'an said he led a bunch of other angels and rebelled, and of course, Lucifer is condemned to the Hell. We can see the famous excerpt[10]:
""How you have fallen from heaven, morning star, son of the dawn! You have been cast down to the earth, you who once laid low the nations! You said in your heart, ""I will ascend to the heavens; I will raise my throne above the stars of God; I will sit enthroned on the mount of assembly, on the utmost heights of Mount Zaphon. I will ascend above the tops of the clouds; I will make myself like the Most High."" But you are brought down to the realm of the dead, to the depths of the pit.""
     It just sounds oddly familiar. Change the protagonists in the story into scientists and their carefully engineered or synthesized organisms, wouldn't it also be the story of one of synthetic biology’s biggest nightmares?
     Joseph Campbell speaks in his book The power of Myth of the underestimated importance of myths.[11]According to him, who was influenced by Jungian Psychology[12], humans are born with a psychological construct inherited from their father’s fathers i.e."

Laboratory work would be in full swing for all teams and we thought it would be a nice moment to get together and share our           experiences. We were are happy that all Dutch teams were represented during our Meet-up!
The Meet-up kicked off with some snacks and drinks during which the teams could relax and get to know each other in a more personal way. After this, the BBQ was fired up.           The teams could enjoy delicious food prepared by our own chef, Chiel van Amstel . Serving halal meat, vegan and vegetarian options, we made sure everyone was provided quality food.
Next, we hosted a pub quiz to stimulate conversation about all teams’ respective projects. To our pleasant surprise we saw that the teams are well versed in the other Dutch iGEM projects. The absolute winners of the Pub Quiz were iGEM           teams Groningen and Eindhoven!
In short, the Dutch Meet-up and BBQ was a wonderful event where plans for collaborations were furthered and ideas for next meet-ups were exchanged. We would like to thank all teams for a lovely evening.

Instagram Challenge
This year we took the opportunity to participate in the “Instagram Challenge For July” by iGEM Stony Brook .           This allowed us to enlighten our social network about our project, the people behind it and to give them a glance in the life of an iGEM’er. We love initiatives like this which enable participating teams to promote iGEM worldwide, showcase           team diversity and dedication!
Music Video
Near the end of our time in the lab, we were approached by iGEM TEC CEM for a music video collaboration. Their idea was to get as many iGEM teams together           as possible to participate in a music video for the song: “Labs Like you”, which           was rewritten from “Girls Like You” by Maroon 5. We were very excited to participate, and fortunately - and unsurprisingly - so were many other iGEM teams! There we so many interested teams that iGEM TEC CEM decided to write a second song           to, “Moves Like iGEM”, based on “Moves Like Jagger” by Maroon 5. We took this fun opportunity and recorded a short piece for the music video, which iGEM TEC"

Carnegie_Mellon,2012,Team:Carnegie Mellon#Hum-Overview_-_-_TEXT.html," changes.  To achieve this goal, we built an affordable, microcontroller-based, hardware platform and also developed an associated, open-source, simulation software .
The combined hardware/software platform allows the students to directly manipulate electronic components, which are formal equivalents of the BioBricks used in our sensor, and to observe the effect of changing these components on the current or voltage output, which is the equivalent of the fluorescence intensity in our lab experiments. In using the kit, the students get a feel for how different promoters are compared using the biosensor; they can rank ""virtual promoters"" in the order of their strength. Students who use the kit gain hands-on experience and understand how all the parts of the biosensor work together to measure the mRNA and protein levels, without working in the wet lab. The figure on the right is a photograph of the hardware platform on which the correspondence between the biological components of the biosensor and the electronic components of the kit are identified.
The software used in the platform is based on the model derived for the analysis of the fluorescence data obtained with the biosensor. We have also created a GUI that allows the students to modify the parameters used in the model and to visualize on a computer display the current/voltage output (which is the equivalent of the fluorescence output in our experiments).
Team Presentations to Groups of High School Students
To obtain feedback for how high school students use the circuit kit, the team has given several presentations about synthetic biology and our project to high school students enrolled in the SAMS and in AP Biology at Carnegie Mellon University.  We have also sought and obtained feedback on the kit from Dr. Janet Waldeck, Physics teacher at the Pittsburgh Allderdice High School in Pittsburgh.   The feedback and input gained from these presentations was used to refine the kit.
Broader Impact in Biological Modeling Methodology
The methodology used to build the electrical equivalent of the biological processes is not unique to the problem we are solving in this project. Starting from first principles modeling, one can use the methodology followed in our circuit kit implementation and emulate the behavior of the processes governing other biological phenomena by using simple controllers and circuit components. This shows that interdisciplinary training is not only desirable, but can also be beneficial for solving synthetic biology problems, thereby underscoring the importance of such training starting from high school through college.
