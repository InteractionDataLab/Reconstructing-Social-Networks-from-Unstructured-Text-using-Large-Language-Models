Conclusions and Future Work
Though we have generated a sizable library of promoters of varying strengths and functions, we lacked the time to complete its characterization by the screening against targeted molecules.
Due to time constraints, we also lacked the time to characterise these parts into the Sensynova platform within the lab.

Rationale and Aim
The Sensynova multicellular biosensor platform has been developed to overcome the limitations identified by our team that hamper the success in biosensor development. One of these limits regards the lack of modularity and reusability of the various components. Our platform design, based on the expression of three main modules (Detector, Processor and Reporter) by three"

Market / Industry Analysis. The project is enveloped within the context of an industry/market. Market research is done on current and future market trends, competition, complementary products, suppliers, clients, etc. Based               on this information, a competitive analysis is made to establish how the project (future company) could succeed in the respective environment (for example, by a SWOT analysis - will be explained later).
Product / Service. Describes the final product / service meant to be sold. Advantages or disadvantages of the product should be compared to existing similar solutions. Included is a description of R&D activities, evolution               of product (life cycle), and legal issues or patenting if the case.
Marketing & Sales strategy. What customers can you sell to, how to communicate with them, how to sell the product/service. Moreover, this section must describe a long-term strategy on how to maintain and increase client base,               while fending off competition.
Management and Organizational Structure. Essential to any project or company are its people and their interactions. This section should detail what kind of people the company will employ (both personal and professional typologies)               and how they will be managed within a chosen organizational structure.
Social / Environmental impact. Although this section is not a must-have for regular business plans, it is highly recommended for iGEM. A core iGEM goal is to make Synthetic Biology known and understandable to the world. Therefore, it is important to predict how the project will be perceived by society, and how society can influence the evolution of business. NOTE: One should be aware not to repeat information that is already treated in Policy and Practice modules. Rather, impacts found in the Policy and Practice section should be analysed here from a business perspective.
(Optional) Investment and Financial forecast. This section is traditionally necessary for a business plan, but an exception can be made in the context of iGEM. As the target audience are not necessary investors, but the iGEM               community and public, this section may be skipped. Moreover, financial forecasts and investment plans require considerable effort and expertise in order to be convincing. It is better to skip this part than write an unrealistic plan.
Use business theory and concepts
When writing a business plan, content information needs to be supported by existing business theory. Here are some points to consider:
Critical factors for new businesses. One can start developing a business plan by considering four essential factors that make or break a new business as proposed by (Sahlman, 2008). Here"

STEP 2 : CONSTRUCTION OF THE PLASMID DETECTOR
1. Design of the detector in silico
1.1 The target
The bioinformatic work aimed to find a specific Vibrio cholerae sequence to detect.  First, it was necessary to study Vibrio cholerae (Vc) pathogenicity. The known epidemic strains [1] O1 (GeneBank : KF664566.1) and O139 (AF302794.1) sequences available on PubMed have been deeply studied. Importantly, Vc’s pathogenicity is premised on the integration of a bacteriophage sequence - bacteriophage CTX - in Vc’s genome [2]. Indeed, the integrated sequence contains genes for toxins, responsible for symptoms of cholera disease. Based on the actual knowledge"

We offered advice on a bio-lab they planned to build in August, and they invited us to also use the lab and help their Fablab students. After the long talk, we realized that to promote bio-hacking and let the idea penetrate into daily lives still need a long process, rather than something that could be achieved a day. To reach the purpose, we should use every possible chance to deliver the concept and our ideas to both normal people and Makers. We should also focus on educating students on bio-hacking, planting this knowledge beforehand. More importantly, Makers in Shenzhen and all over the world should collaborate together and work on promoting this idea in the society. We understood a lot of things through this important visit, and it influenced our next steps in Human Practice significantly."

Ashlee and Emily met with Dr. Richard to discuss research using his biomass hydrolyzer and using a HYSYS model of a biorefinery plant to evaluate the economic benefits of increasing the threshold of furfural/HMF toxin bacteria can tolerate by inserting the HMF-ABCDE catabolism pathway. We will begin manipulating the Aspen Plus model and Economic analysis from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) .
Plan for continuing codon optimization project is supported by the advisers. Clay updated notebook online as well as the document diagramming the design process of the project.More RBS calculations run. Problem with RBS library calculator at this point is that using no initial condition (only N's in the  constraints field, followed by Pst1) the calculator does not mutate the Pst1 site that needs to be part of the dRBS, but yields very low TIR. Using a strong initial condition, followed by Pst1, the calculator yields acceptable TIR but mutates Pst1. Inserting Pst1 into these calculations after the fact, and then using the ""evaluate"" function of the calculator shows that TIR drops precipitously. Calculations were run in single RBS forward engineering mode to determine max TIR that can be found using only N's and Pst1. Culture of pFTV harboring cells inoculated.

Ashlee performed a transformation of Plasmid 1 into DH10B Escherichia coli electrocompetent cells via electroporation and plated this on Kanamycin plates. This was done to regenerate our Plasmid 1 so we can digest it and insert the dCas9 and Lambda Red Recombinase systems. She updated the Notebook and Project pages, and is constructing figures for her design process. She is having trouble with ""div"" functions in HTML and is consequently frustrated. We met with Dr. Salis and Dr. Richard for our biweekly iGEM meeting and Ashlee presented the work on the website, presentation and Emily's demonstration idea for the Center for Science and the Schools, and current progress on the project.
Culture of pFTV harboring cells plasmid harvested, much better concentration of pFTV measured than before. Inverse PCR conducted again, this time using optimized protocol and 3 tubes. Lab meeting."

The negative reference did not show any detectable activity. It should be noted that the growth medium for the strain containing PalcA was different from the growth medium of the reference strains. Furthermore, the PalcA strain did not grow well in the glycerol containing media. This means that in principal PalcA can not be compared to the reference. The figure above shows that the specific activity of PgpdA 1.0 kb is more than double the specific activity of DMKP-P6. The figure also shows that the specific activity of PalcA when compared to PgpdA 1.0 kb is more than three times as high. Compared with the qualitative analysis, we would have expected that the specific activity of PalcA and DMKP-P6 would have been similar to the activity of PgpdA 1.0 kb this was however not the case.

UNOTT,2017,Team:UNOTT#Experiments_-_-_TEXT.html," an additional control like sgRNA0 is for the gRNA parts design. It will help making sure no unspecific interference happens when no promoter is present. The second graph shows W1-4. It is clear there are some extremely different expression levels. SP3 and SP4 are quite similar with peaks of 5500-5800 a.u. at 24 hours; it would be hard to discern between them, but these are significantly the strongest promoters and would be useful as a ‘maximum’ expression promoter. SP1 and W4 are also quite comparable with peak around 3000 a.u., these would be considered intermediate/strong promoters. W3, W1, SP2 and perhaps SP5 are all relatively similar with peaks from 900-1700 a.u. at 24 hours. These would be considered weak promoters, they would be useful in a triple reporter experiment to act as the separate targets for the sgRNAs and see if they have distinct inhibited states. W2 is by far the weakest active promoter, with a peak at >500 it would be classed as the weakest promoter, perhaps serving as a minimum activation promoter. SE as expected produced no expression, and can be concluded it will work as a negative control or null promoter. In conclusion, it is promising that we have 5 distinct states of expression with maximal, strong, weak, minimal, and off. There is also the opportunity to have SP2, W1, W2 and maybe SP5 to act as a way to discern how effective the sgRNA:dCas9 inhibition, owing to their similar expression patterns.
STEP 4: Random Ligations
Why
The random ligation of different promoter-protein bricks is an experiment to test the viability of a brownian motion driven random ligation process. This random ligation is the basis for the unpredictability of a large scale key design process. The experiment hoped to produce a random mixture of fluorescent protein expression levels. This random mixture of multiple proteins in a single vector would then show the viability of the Key. coli restriction enzyme-ligation process for achieving unpredictability for keys.
How
The strongest and weakest promoters were chosen to give the most easily visible result, promoters E and 4. Promoter 4 gives a high expression of fluorescent proteins, as shown by our promoter library findings. The promoters were then attached to each reporter protein CFP, RFP and GFP via BsaI digestion and ligation along with a terminator to form six ""brick"" variants. After amplification of the bricks produced via PCR, seven products combinations were ligated to a low copy backbone in the"

A transcription will not end at a terminator with termination efficiency less than 100% (values are stored in attribute forwardTerminatorEfficiency/reverseTerminatorEfficiency): RNA polymerase will pass over and continue transcription. For translation reactions, the prerequisite condition is that the part next to RBS along the 5' to 3' direction must have non-zero attribute value forwardStartCodon/reverseStartCodon. Opposite to transcriptions, translation reactions would stop if one part with non-zero attribute value forwardStopCodon/reverseStopCodon is encountered.
Volume strategy is a special method to solve problems introduced by diffusion reactions. Consider a transport reaction S1->S2 in which the species S1 is moved from the first compartment with volume V1, to the second with volume V2. The rate constant is k but the rate law is not k*[S1]*V1, because the concentration conversion is needed. The correct expression is N*k*[S1]*V1. The volume strategy just uses N*V1 instead of V1 as the volume of the first compartment. To have a general definition, the volume of a compartment is defined as V*N1*N2, where:
V is the volume of the compartment itself;
N1 is the number of compartments located in its outside compartment;
N2 is the total number of its outside compartment
Chain Sorting and Weighting Scheme
Chains in our Chain-Node model should not have any order since there are no natural ways to sort them. One chain is not preferred to another, since in a complex of multiple chains, which are connected via binding interaction of binding bites on their own, all chains are equivalent. However, a chain-sorting program is a prerequisite for implementations of many other functions, such as comparison of two Chain-Node structures, or pattern matching of template species to those in the system.
Sorting is always performed under some rules. Since there are no natural options, we design one to generate the unique order for a list of chains. The rule we developed is something like that for comparing two strings: compare the first part of two chains by their partReference and partType in alphabet order and if equal, then compare the next until there are differences or to the end of either chain. At this stage, besides partReference and partType, two parts are considered equal if both are in bound states or not. There are some exceptions for DNA molecule: since dsDNA has both forward and reverse directions, comparison between its forward and reverse chain is also needed.

Hi, my name is Andrew. I’m currently pursuing a degree in Computer Science with a minor in Biochemistry. I enjoy working on problems that integrate computer science and biology, both hardware and software. My professional interests include automation and scientific instrumentation. In my free time I enjoy working on cars and welding.  I joined iGEM for the experience of using biology to solve a real world problem.
This summer I worked on several methods of quantifying the signal produced by our biosensor. I also contributed to the outreach of the project and sample collection.
Hi. I am Andrew Michelmore, a second year Electrical Engineer at Santa Clara University. I am very interested in the engineering and design of power grids, as well as in transistor organization for processors and microprocessors. I hope to pursue a career in one of these areas. I decided to join iGEM, because I was interested in the engineering approach and view iGEM has towards biology.
I contributed to the project mostly through outreach and wastewater collection. I also assisted with hardware and hardware testing.
University of California Davis, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Medicine and School of Medicine
My scientific efforts are focused on combining computational and experimental tools to develop a fundamental knowledge of enzyme catalysis, and applying those principles to design novel proteins of therapeutic or commercial interest. Currently I am working with an international community on the development of Rosetta computational methodology for predicting and designing macromolecular structures, interactions, and functions. Using this methodology I have completed the de novo design of enzymes capable of catalyzing chemical reactions not found in nature, such as the Diels-Alder reaction. This was followed up by working with an online community, Foldit, to further engineer these proteins for enhanced activity. Most recently I have worked on the redesign of naturally occurring enzymes for the degradation of immunogenic gluten proteins, to develop a novel CO2 fixation pathways, and design of a novel anthrax therapeutic. My current focus is on the design of novel biofuel and commodity chemical biosynthetic pathways, the development of novel therapeutics, and the general understanding of the relationship between protein sequence, structure, and function.
University of California Davis, Department of Computer Science and UC Davis Genome Center
My lab’s interests span a variety of topics related to evolutionary, synthetic and systems biology. We employ machine learning, graph theory, mathematical optimization, multiscale modeling and HPC simulation methods to address questions in these fields. Computational predictions are experimentally tested in our microbiology lab, where we perform laboratory evolution of microbial cultures, and we construct novel synthetic gene circuits for biotechnological applications.

If the ratio of a sample and the negative control is above a certain theshold (10%), a valid biosensor signal is detected. Additionally it is checked, if the value for the positive control (drop of sfGFP) is above a certain value, confirming the functionality of the biosensor.

The Black case
We showed that, the fluorescence detection works fine, but it's not very practical to take the photo. The filters have to be in the exact right position directly in front of the camera and the flash. It also has to be quite dark for high quality pictures. Therefore we designed a black case and realized it with a 3D printer. Marco Radukic programmed the file for the 3d print in exact accordance with our guideline. The top smartphone inlay can be specifically changed for different smartphone types. The test stripe can be placed on the push loading drawer and inserted into the box. Thus it is quite easy to use. The smartphone is put on the top inlay, the test strip is inserted and the taken photo provides information about the contamination. To download the model for the 3D printing click here.

Newcastle,2017,Team:Newcastle#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," and ammonium acetate, which, as has already been explained earlier, is not unusual as cell extract require specific amounts of these salts for high activity. Other supplements which appear to be having a strong negative effect on CFPS activity, such as the tRNAs and Co-enzyme A, are harder to explain.
Due to a lack of time, repeats of these experimental designs were not performed, and therefore the results of this analysis are only indicative. Further experimentation should be performed to validate these results, and hence the conclusions drawn.
Conclusions and Future Work
This study has begun multifactorial analysis on the components of the supplemental solution for cell free protein synthesis systems. It has provided evidence that some supplements have a greater effect on protein synthesis activity than others, and that the important factors may differ between cell extract batches. The ability to use a Design of Experiments approach towards the optimisation of CFPS systems has also been demonstrated. While this study has provided evidence to-wards these claims, further work should be performed to validate the findings. A DoE screening design for the supplements of CFPS sys-tems should be used on the same cell extract batch repeatedly. This will help confirm that the screening models derived from the experi-mental design data are accurate. The screening design should also be performed on many different batches of at least moderately active cell extracts to confirm that important supplements do differ between batches. Following the above, a surface response design could be used for all commonly important supplements of the CFPS system to deter-mine its effectiveness at optimising CFPS activity. The information could also be used to determine commonly unimportant supplements so they can be eliminated from the supplement solution, hence de-creasing the cost per reaction.

With the purpose of reaching out to different areas of the community and spreading knowledge about synthetic biology, as well as our project, we held presentations at several events and cooperated with the Swedish Makerspace association. Read more by clicking the buttons below were we discuss the importance of sharing information and explain the presentations we held.
Importance of spreading knowledge
Reaching out
Information Transfer to the Public
To engender a society free from corruption and to uphold it in a democratic manner, there is today an active debate about the information transfer to the public. The debate include certain dilemmas, such as what information might actually be of use for the public knowledge, more than just a hindrance. The debate also interferes with the questions of the information flow as a human right within a democratic society.
Uppsala iGEM team 2016 want to encourage scientific information transfer to the public, hence a cooperation have been established with the newly started company, Makerspace.
The definition of a democracy according to Oxford’s dictionary is “the practice or principles of social equality” (www.oxforddictionaries.com, retrieved 13-09-2016). This implies that a society that is considered to have a democratic government shall hold equal information transfer to all members of the society.
Through decades the National Research Council have plunged into issues like how to improve decisions about risks to public health, safety and environmental quality. Several studies have been done by the council that concerns how society can understand and cope with these risks, as well as how contentious decisions about exposure of toxic substances shall be informed to the public. The studies determine what kind of institutional mechanisms that foster a partnership between science and the government (National Research Council, 1983:1).
Improving Risk Communication has had a focus on how to foster the relationship between producers and users of scientific information with the purpose of improving public understanding and thereby obtain a society “with better-informed individual and social choice” (National Research council, 1989:x).

Violacein (Source)
Violacein purple pigment production serves as a simple way to test a multiple gene pathway (such as vitamin production) in an expression vector or neochromosome.  If the gene construct is transformed and the organism becomes purple, the system is successful.  As our main project is in yeast and since purple bacteria was achieved by Cambridge iGEM 2009, we focused on producing violacein in the eukaryotic S. cerevisiae yeast.  We chose violacein specifically as a Boeke Lab rotation student had begun to engineer the violacein pathway in yeast.

BIT-China,2013,Team:BIT-China#humanpractice.html_-_-_TEXT.html," United Nations. It make progress for international environmental. ""Declaration on the Human Environment"" than was passed in this meeting is the first global international documents in human history to protect the environment, and it marks the birth of the international environmental law.
The International Environmental Education Conference, which published the famous ""Belgrade Charter,"" was held in Belgrade in 1975. This Charter sets out the purpose, goals, objects and guiding principles of environmental education.
Copenhagen World Climate Conference was held in Copenhagen the capita of Danish in2009, and it absorbed many representatives from 192 countries, who are to discuss the follow-up program after the first stage of ""Kyoto Protocol"" expired. The conference is regarded as ""the last chance to save humanity"".  After that, ""United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change"" published.
Nowadays,energy crisis and global warming have become increasingly prominent and threated the healthy development of human society. To solve these issues to some extent, we，members from BIT-CHINA,investigate the basis of Bioproduction process at home and abroad and hope to create one kind of heat self-regulated E.coli with the help of synthetic biology.
We can see that E. coli is still the main industrial model strain used in the process of domestic production of bio-based chemicals from the current industrial production process. Applying our new E.coli to the fermentation industry is important to biological industry restructuring and healthy development. Our research can broaden the optimum fermentation temperature of E.coli to effectively activate reaction process, accelerate the metabolic process flow and control the reaction mass transfer efficiency, and thereby improving the efficiency of cell product synthesis; In addition, the application of this project can effectively save water and power resources, reduce fuel consumption, such as coal and oil, and thus greatly reduce the amount of CO2 generated by thermal power, effectively curb global warming and other environmental issues.Last but not least, our project is conducive to the sustainable development in our society, the harmony in natural ecosystems, and the environmental protection of global village,

UFAM_Brazil,2014,Team:UFAM Brazil#Background_-_-_TEXT.html," polymerase cannot recognize the promoter and messenger RNA from other genes involved in resistance to mercury is not produced (repressor). In the presence of Hg2+ merR binds to this element and is displaced from the promoter-operator, which allows the expression of the genes of the operon (inducible) region.
Figure 5. Mercury’s action to activate the genes on the operon.
The regulatory merR gene is transcribed from a promoter, which is oriented divergently from the promoter of the other mer genes, and also down-regulate their own expression (Mukhopadhyay et al. 1991). When the operon is being expressed, the structural genes merD, MerA, merP and merT are also activated.
Figure 6.  Genes orientation involved in the Hg metabolism process. metabolismo Hg.
The other merC, merA, merB, merD, merE and merF genes are involved in bacteria broad-spectrum and narrow-spectrum. Bacteria narrow- spectrum have resistance to mercury inorganic compounds that besides include merA, mercury reductase that converts Hg2+ to Hg0, and merD, regulatory protein, may have the merC and merF genes, which are responsible for the transport of Hg in the cell. The broad spectrum possess beyond resistance to inorganic compounds, genes involved in resistance activities to organic mercury compounds, namely: merB, organomercurial lyase protein that breaks bonds C-Hg+; and merE carrier protein of methylmercury that captures organo-mercury compounds to the cytoplasm.
Genes of mer operon were made by bioinformatics tools. From this, we construct the merRTP and merA genes, thinking such as essential genes for the transport and breakdown of mercury in the cell, acting as a bioremediador. From iGEM parts of the kit 2014, we used a GFP to construct a biosensor in which genes merRTP were connected with the fluorescent protein. Besides this part, we used another part called MBP, this would be linked to merRTP to allow bioaccumulation of mercury present in the medium, linking this protein to mercury.
The future goals of the team is to make the recombinant bacteria will be cultured in medium with mercury, and total mercury detection is analyzed before and after cultivation of bacteria by means of atomic absorption spectrometry. The biosensor system will be done through the construction of tanks in series, where the first bacterium will be able to detect mercury (merR"

Synthetic Biology
Bordeaux Project Summary
Our project aims at reproducing multicellular-like behavior in the bacteria Escherichia coli. The idea came from the patterns visible on some animals, like the “pseudo-eyes” on a butterfly wing. As well, we thought about the formation of stripes on tigers or zebra. Such patterns are created thanks to a very precise genetic regulation. So what we want to do here is modeling a regulation mechanism existing in eukaryotes in a simple organism. The bacteria will share the same DNA but should be able to display a different phenotype depending on the signal received by its neighbors. The phenotype here will be the expression of three different colors. The bacteria should be able to communicate between them. A light signal is used as the first inducer of our mechanism. Then, the first cells activated by the input signal send a signal to its neighbor that will react to it by changing its color, and sending another message to the next cell. This will allow us to draw different patterns on the petri dish.

Modelling - Python - Script
Our IGEM project aim to create a regulation system into the bacteria (a strain of Escherichia coli). The goal of that project is to have just one strain of bacteria able to create concentric patterns on flat surfaces. The challenge consist of modeling a regulation mecanism that mimic the cellular differentiation and cellular communication seen with eucaryotes.
We have first decided to make a modeling and simulation software of that regulation system. This first step will permit us to test several parameters and try some variations of the concentration and others factors involved (reduction of the activity of some operon, etc ). This parts we hope will give us the best conditions for our next biological manipulations.

Mtd (BPP-1 bacteriophage)
This part codes for the Major Tropism Determinant (Mtd) protein responsible for selective protein binding by the BPP-1 bacteriophage. In its native form, it has moderate affinity to the pertactin proteins expressed on the surface of Bordetella, the phage's natural host. The mtd gene has 22 specific nucleotides in its sequence that can be mutagenized to change the binding properties without adversely affecting the folding and stability of the protein. Mutations to these nucleotides give the Mtd protein the potential to bind to a very large range of target proteins. The mutagenic sites are highlighted below in red:
Mutagenic Sites on mtd gene.
In the natural phage system, libraries of mtd are created by the BPP-1 bacteriophage's Diversity Generating Retroelement. For in vitro library generation, synthetic methods such as PCR using variable oligonucleotides can be used.

Bacteria Distribution
After orally ingested, certain amounts of modified probiotic L. casei can survive under acidic condition when passing through the stomach. Owning to gastric acid, bile acid and digestive enzymes, the presence of these bacteria in the intestinal tract only last for a limited time, and then are washed out in faeces. [1] During the process of transition and temporary colonization, CPP-PYY complexes are produced and exert the following effect.
In the first part of Modeling, bacteria distribution in the small intestine was investigated. Data from Y. K. Lee et al. showed bacteria number against time adhered on the duodenum, jejunum, and ileum in mouse after orogastric intubation of 109 L. casei, which were listed in Table 1. [2] The ratio (%) of bacteria number to total ingested number were also indicated.

By summing up all the data, we constructed the continuous L. casei cell number and ratio distribution against time with curve fitting in MATLAB, as shown in Fig.1-1-1 and Fig.1-1-2. However, experimental data from suicide mechanism should be incorporated to complete the simulation for the survival of L. casei in the small intestine, here we hypothesized 4 days for bacteria survival. Therefore, the time-changing tendency could be utilized for further calculation.

The largest impact on biodiversity from GMO is seen in agriculture. In agriculture an increase in GM plants can be seen, as crops have been modified to be herbicide tolerant (HT). This is primarily seen in soy, maize and cotton UCN (2007) ”Current knowledge of the impacts of genetically modified organisms on biodiversity and human health”. . There are also plants modified to be arthropod tolerant (Bt), and is toxic to specific groups of arthropods.

Reproducibility is the main concern with many science based innovations and our hope is that with the DNA Origami library, we are able to cut down on time and resources spent troubleshooting with DNA origami construction, so that innovators can dedicate their energy innovating with DNA origami rather than making DNA origami. Our hope is that from this open source frame work, innovations with DNA origami can come about similar to how dNANO is an innovation in nano circuitry stemming off of DNA origami. However, with many innovations come the issue of ownership and intellectual property.

Intellectual property is described as any product, invention that has come about from the creative process and has the ability to be protected by a patent, copyright, trademark or any other form of legislative protection. With our novel innovation in DNA origami, dNANO, we wanted to know more about the legislation that is out there to ensure that any innovations from our open source initiative can be made ours. We consulted TEC Edmonton, a startup incubator for more information in regards to IP rights in determining what is protected under Canadian patent law. A patent is a method of protecting inventions in which the inventor discloses the details of the creation to the level of detail where another individual can replicate the device in place for exclusive rights to that invention for set amount of time. In Canada and the United States that time is 20 years. According to TEC, in order for an invention to be patentable it must demonstrate 3 attributes:
Novelty- Is this invention/application the first of its kind?
Usefulness- Does this invention show some sort of utility?
Non obviousness- The invention must improve on existing technology that is not obvious. For example, one cannot patent a series of lightbulbs since it does not deviate enough from the base invention being the lightbulb.
Things that can be patented are concepts, inventions and applications of other products. In every patent is a state of claims made by the inventor, so long as there is enough evidence to demonstrate what is claimed in the patent then it has the potential to be patented. By doing so the patentee is claiming their creation is reasonably enabled. The team broke down the DNA origami aspect into three individual components: the template strand, the staple strands and the final structure which all can be patented.
As the act of patenting is costly, we were also introduced to the concept of strategic patenting."

To allow this fusion, the perfect conformation of all protein that composed the SNARE complex is an obligation. Untill now, no one cloned this complex into bacteria. We thought that it will be a very ""dangerous way"" to go for our project, so we decided to focus our effort on the Jun/Fos strategy and the G3P one.

About IGEM
What is the iGEM Competition?
The International Genetically Engineered Machine competition (iGEM) is the premiere undergraduate Synthetic Biology competition. Student teams are given a kit of biological parts at the beginning of the summer from the Registry of Standard Biological Parts. Working at their own schools over the summer, they use these parts and new parts of their own design to build biological systems and operate them in living cells. This project design and competition format is an exceptionally motivating and effective teaching method.
iGEM Competition History
iGEM began in January of 2003 with a month-long course at MIT during their Independent Activities Period (IAP). The students designed biological systems to make cells blink. This design course grew to a summer competition with 5 teams in 2004, 13 teams in 2005 - the first year that the competition grew internationally - 32 teams in 2006, 54 teams in 2007, 84 teams in 2008, 112 teams in 2009, and 130 teams in 2010. Projects ranged from a rainbow of pigmented bacteria, to banana and wintergreen smelling bacteria, an arsenic biosensor, Bactoblood, and buoyant bacteria.

The Team
The Launch
Location: University of York
Date: January 2013
Initiators: Andra Necula and Alexandro Rizzo
Population: 60 in the first meeting, 40 in the first brainstorming session, 20 to begin dry lab work in April, 14 to survive to carry on in the lab.
The Idea
Let’s construct an improved Microbial Fuel Cell (MFC), powered by engineered E.Coli, which also converts harmful gold ions to shiny (yet tiny) gold nanoparticles!
Godparents: Evaldas Klumbys and Kobchai Duangrarranalert
Reason: Our MFC would provide a solution to growing sustainable energy needs, extract gold nanoparticles from pharmaceutical waste
Our team
When did we start?
The iGEM Team formed at the University of York started in January 2013.
Were we popular?
An introductory lecture to the concept of the competition was given by enthusiastic students and later team members – Andra Necula and Alexandro Rizzo.
60! Over 60 students showed up for the first iGEM presentation, after the competition had been advertised widely.
40! From these, about 40 came to the initial brainstorming meeting. Soon after, a couple of workshops were organised. During those workshops there was a further briefing on the details surrounding iGEM. However, the two main points of those were the brainstorming of project ideas and the subscription of new ‘recruits’ for the emerging York team.
20! After choosing two ideas from a list of over 100, about 20 enthusiastic students decided to carry on with the project.
The godparents of our idea
During one of those early sessions the idea of a Microbial Fuel Cell was mentioned by final year students Evaldas Klumbys and Kobchai Duangrattanalert. Being a complex idea, it initially did not receive as much attention as other more “exciting” ideas"

Demonstrate
Endophytic infection by a transformed strain of wild bacteria
We were able to inoculate a model grass species Brachypodium distachyon, a distant relative of the source plant of the endophyte, and demonstrate that the bacteria can grow to occur both root cortex tissue and the root surface. While the bacteria we inoculated under sterile conditions, a similar method is likely capable of inoculating plant in-field, simply by soaking the seeds in bacterial culture prior to planting.
Our experimentation demonstrated that our bacteria can infect a grass plant under near-real-world conditions (but for biosafety, the system was contained). B. distachyon diverged from the original host, switchgrass (Panicum virgatum) 51.6 ± 7.9 (SD) million years ago (Vicentini et al. 2008). B. distachyon is more closely related to the major cereal crops (rice, wheat, corn, barley, rye and oats) than it is to switchgrass. Because of the cereal crops’ relationship to the plant we reinfected, we hypothesize that this endophytic bacteria can help promote growth and health in these important food crops.

However, conducting the experiment using the agar-design, we encountered a problem: after some hours the LB-agar/agarose started to shrink and dried out. Thus, the agar-design cannot be used without modifications for experiments of longer duration.
In an attempt we only left a small agar fragment in each channel and filled the rest with liquid medium, so as to decrease chance of it drying out, while avoiding at the same time that bacteria from one chamber reach the other chamber.
The bead-design consists of an alginate bead for each chamber and liquid medium in between. The beads either contained regulator/sensor-bacteria or AHL.

Week 14 : Diffusion experiments started, simulated with Comsol, and fitting of quorum sensing dynamics
Monday, August 25th
We carried diffusion experiment with different designs : punched PDMS, liquid, beads. For every design we added high concentrations of pure AHL in the sender well, so cells are glowing a lot. However because of this high concentration, diffusion is very high and at a given AHL concentration, receiving cells are glowing at the same time for all 4 channel lengths. Check the corresponding article for more details.
We have a Comsol simulation for these experiments that explains why at this concentration of AHL (1mM), all 4 wells glow at the same time irrespectively of channel length. Check this article for more details.
We could fit degradation rates of external, internal AHL and GFP thanks to quorum sensing dynamic curves.

Fitting quorum sensing dynamic curves
Monday, August 24th
We could use quorum sensing dynamic curves to fit degradation rates of external, internal AHL and GFP. We fitted the experimental results for lux with riboregulator and thus didn't consider leakiness (we showed leakiness was low enough in that case when fitting quorum sensing Hill function parameters ). By writing GFP production rate and replacing AHL in this equation by $$[AHL]=[AHL_i]-[AHL_{bound}]$$ we find  $$\frac{d[GFP]}{dt}=\frac{k_{45}[P_{tot}]\Big(-1+\sqrt{1+8\frac{AHL_i}{K_{d3}}}\Big)^2}{16\frac"

Cependant, les approches actuelles à cet effet compter sur génétique germinale, et en tant que tels sont difficiles à contrôler précisément du point de vue du génie métabolique et de la biologie synthétique. Notre intention est de créer un système plus dynamique de faire varier la taille d'antenne qui dépend de l'intensité de la lumière incidente et qui peut facilement être optimisé en utilisant la biologie de synthèse de principes. Ce système devrait aboutir à la bactérie à l'extérieur du bioréacteur exprimant antenne récolte moins de lumière que les cellules de protéines à l'intérieur, de réduire NPQ tout en maintenant une forte absorption de photons accessoires. Nous mettrons l'accent sur la modification de la quantité de la récolte Light Complex 2 (LH2) par la réglementation de la pucB / A gènes qui codent pour les deux sous-unités du complexe. LH2 absorbe un maximum de photons à la longueur d'onde de 842 nm et des entonnoirs de conversion de l'énergie à LH1 et le centre réactionnel. Le ratio des complexes LH2 pour LH1 naturellement varie de 3,0 à 6,7 en fonction de diverses conditions de luminosité (Scheuring et al., 2005).Nous proposons que, si ce ratio de LH2 de LH1 est modifié l'ordre de 0-7 ou plus en réponse à l'intensité de la lumière incidente, la photosynthèse l'efficacité et la productivité d'une culture de R. sphaeroides mai être maximisée.

Results: No bands were observed at the expected sizes (1360 bp for agp, 1341 bp for KnR, 209 for petBD, and 1768 bp for INV). Thus, the gibson assembly primers are to be reconstructed and reordered for future PCR reactions.
VG:GLF (1605bp) and INV (1728bp) in the pUC57 (2710bp) ampicillin resistant vector were minipreped and 0.5mg of each sample of GLF and INV in the pUC57 ampicillin resistant vector were digested with EcoRI and PstI restriction enzymes and checked on a 1% agarose gel. GLF was properly digested showing bands at about 2000 bp and 1600 bp. Also, the GLF samples grew on chloromphenicol plates. Thus, two GLF samples were sent for sequencing at the Nevada Genomics Center to check if GLF was present in the pSB1C3 vector. The INV digest was not successful, producing a single band for all samples. Samples of GLF and INV in the pUC57 ampicillin resistant vector were obtained from Dr. Shintani and transformed in DH5α E.coli cells on AMP plates. The transformation was successful. As a result, 10 cultures were made for GLF and 10 cultures for INV in 2ml of LB-AMP liquid broth. The sequencing results for GLF from were checked. The sequencing was not complete. Thus, new primers were designed for further sequencing.  The GLF and INV in the pUC57 cultures were minipreped and 0.5mg of all 10 GLF and INV minipreps were digested with EcoRI and PstI and checked along with 0.25mg of uncut GLF and INV on a 1% agarose gel. All digested samples for GLF showed two bands at 2700 bp and 1600bp. Samples 3 and 10 showed a third band at about 5000bp. All digested samples for INV showed two bands at 2700 bp and 1700bp. Samples 2 and 3 showed an extra third band at about 5000bp and sample 4 showed four bands, with the fourth band being above the 5000 bp band."

The children were learning in hands-on experiments and were introduced to knowledge in a playful atmosphere. All of these experiments were very well received by children and parents.
With the adults we discussed Synthetic Biology and genetic engineering. We explained our projects and informed the public about the iGEM competition. Most people were quite interested and asked lots of questions. We were happy to have a high attendance all day long.
Our booth in front of the Bielefeld Town Hall
The chromatography experiment was fun and lots of colorful and diverse works were produced
Inside the tent, our young attendants could do an isolation of fruit DNA by using common household materials.
With joy and excitement, the children learned basic laboratory techniques from us. Here, Manuel is showing two girls how to use a pipet.
Assessment
The whole event was very educational for us, since we learned how informed the public is on the subject and we heard many opinions. This also allowed us to find out whether people would be open to using microbial fuel cells in their everyday life. A lot of useful feedback was obtained during conversations with the adults who visited our booth. To collect even more information, we handed out questionnaires to 52 of our adult visitors before they left the booth. This number is of course not high enough to gain reliable statistical data, but it still gave us a good impression of some general tendencies in the public opinion. The questionnaire was written in German, an English translation can be found here .

We were happy to find, that our interviewees do not outright reject the idea directed genetic modification and Synthetic Biology. Almost all people we talked to were quite interested in the topic and agreed that many beneficial applications are possible. This is also reflected in the results of our survey (see Figure 1).

Modeling
Us visiting him at Imperial
Dr Thomas Ouldridge
Early on in our project we met Dr Thomas Ouldridge, a Royal Society University Research Fellow at the Department of Bioengineering at Imperial College London. He strengthened our modeling foundations and told us what assumptions were sensible for our system. He explained energy landscapes of nucleic strand displacements, which helped us increase the specificity of our first series of switches despite us not modeling the toehold switch binding base-by-base.
We went back to him a couple of months later with our mass action kinetics model. He located where we could remove unneeded complexity from our model. After changing the model accordingly, we were able to to narrow our model to have just 4 main parameters. This allowed us to vary them to test the effects of changing the parts of our toehold switch, for example the RBS and promoter strength to optimize the dynamic range. This made our model orders of magnitude more useful to both our design and wetlab teams. See our modeling page to learn more about why fewer parameters is better and how our model influenced our design and implementation of our project.
Applications
Dr Daniel Pregibon
We spoke to Dr Daniel Pregibon, who works for Abcam, and developed a new method of quantifying miRNAs. He advised that our method could prove especially  effective in low resource settings and in situations where results are needed urgently. He also advised us on the clinical use of miRNAs as biomarkers.
We have looked further into all of this on our silver human practices page .

We were unsure as to the clinical implementation of our project, so we spoke with Dr Justin Daniels, a pediatrician and clinical director, who has served on NICE (National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, a UK public body that provides national guidance to improve healthcare) appraisal committees. He suggested its main value could be as a screening tool for high risk individuals. We knew previously about how beneficial early detection of NSCLC is, but we had not explored the clinical implementation of our sensor before talking to him. He suggested offering the"
UMaryland,2018,Team:UMaryland#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," week we assembled our PETase Gblock and transformed it. We ran a gel on the PETase and sent it for sequencing. Unfortunately, it seems like the backbone annealed onto itself rather than assembling with the Gblock. We are going to run it again but attempt to further optimize the process so it hopefully doesn’t happen again. It’s starting to get to the point of summer where people are going to have to leave the housing near campus which will make it more difficult for students to come in and continue doing work.
Week of July 23rd
Once again, we attempted to assemble the PETase from the Gblock and transformed and miniprepped before sending for sequencing. This time, it ended up working for us and we can now 3A assemble it with the cellulose-binding domain and our secretion system. The transformation of PETase with the HlyBD was successful so next week we will make overnights and send it for sequencing to confirm that it was assembled correctly.
Week of July 30th
We made overnights of our plasmid and sent it for sequencing. As we are getting closer to finishing up our plasmid, we started making plans for experiments to test the efficacy of our project when it comes to degradation. We also are now planning on making a way to detect plastic degradation through the use of other enzymes and plasmids. We looked at past iGEM projects for any ideas and started contacting other labs for certain plasmids to detect the byproducts of PET degradation. We also started working on a rough draft of a Jamboree presentation to display all the data and planning that has gone into our project so far. Professor Masai and Professor Jha were contacted regarding TPH enzymes and PcaU, respectively.
Week of August 6th
At this time, a bunch of lab members went on vacation since we didn’t have campus housing during August. Also, we only have two more weeks until school starts so we decided to give people a break and only a few people were in lab at that time. TPH plasmids arrived from Masai! Transformed and verified by SDS PAGE.

After the wet lab team spent hours designing primers by consulting with various online tools and using some good old guess and check, our dry lab team came to the rescue and designed a Primer Design calculator. After inputting a sequence you need a primer for, it will provide a list of potential primers sorted by Tm, and will also take into consideration restriction sites if specified by the user. Feel free to test it out - maybe you can help improve it!
The second major part of software was designing and creating a phone app. A worker or consumer, (or anybody!) can open the app, take a photo of one of our stickers or of the plate, and will be provided with a cumulative ethylene reading and a comment about how ripe the fruit is! We extended our success in this area by also designing a working phone app for Hamburg iGEM that works in a similar way in conjunction with their chlamydia biosensor.

In contrast, treatment with geraniol of E. coli JM109 (WT) and of E. coli JM109 (marA) showed toxicities to both strains (Figs. 14 B, C and D). If we watch the colony numbers carefully, E. coli JM109 (marA) had more than E. coli JM109 (WT) during these treatment intervals ((Figs. 14 C and D). These results demonstrate that toxicity of the geraniol was less to the strain E. coli JM109 (marA) than the strain E. coli JM109 (WT).

How to quantify channel capacity of gene regulatory networks?
We transfect HEK-293 human cells with our plasmid constructions as described in the form [ref: table]. Different concentrations of Dox are applied to cell culture at the same time.
Transfected cells are cultured for 48 hours before performing flow cytometry, long enough for protein expression level to achieve steady state. FACS examination measures florescent intensity emitted by each cell, from which we obtain a large sample of florescent protein expression level, tens of thousands of cells for each experiment group.
Data collected from flow cytometry are later analyzed on computers. We estimated probability density function (p.d.f.) from data using kernel density estimation, a nonparametric statistics method. Given high and low Dox concentration input, cells exhibit different probability distributions, as illustrated in the example below [ref: fig].
What we have in hand is the conditional distribution $p\left( {Y\left| {X = x} \right.} \right)$ , given a known level of input $x$ . In order to calculate mutual information $I\left( {X;Y} \right) = \iint {p\left( {x,y} \right){{\log }_2}\frac{{p\left( {x,y} \right)}}{{p\left( x \right)p\left( y \right)}}dxdy}$  and estimate channel capacity, which is $C = \sup I\left( {X;Y} \right)$ , we need to find the input distribution $p\left( X \right)$ and joint distribution $p\left( {X,Y} \right)$ that optimizes the equation. $p\left( X \right)$ , however, is not known in the first place. We first randomly pick a stochastic vector as the initial input distribution and then use an optimization algorithm to iterate the function and maximize $I\left( {X;Y}"

Extract DNA of Strawberry in Kitchen
This movie is original, please indicate the source when reship it.
Pinciples
1. After pinch the strawberry, the cell will be broken and the contains will get out. It’s not difficult to broke the cell because there are full of big vacuole.
2. In this simplified DNA extract process, the adding of detergent is to crush the cells because there are some phosphatide on the cell membrane. After the detergent has dissolved them, the surface of the cell will be full of little holes.
3. After adding the ethanol, the DNA will precipitate out. This is because DNA is polarity molecule (and also the RNA and nucleotide), but the ethanol is nonpolar molecule, the DNA can’t be dissolved. Salt can make DNA easier to separate out.
4. So, if you have some strawberry left, only one and you can see the DNA with your own eyes.
5. Only a few kinds of thing which can be found in home, anyone can break the cell wall of strawberry and divide the DNA out. At last, you can twist the DNA with your chopsticks. And now, DNA won’t be an abstract concept, neither the double helix model which is made by the computer. It’s just here, in front you eyes. This is the most important matter among all the creature.
By the way, the biological technic is not always so easy, but you can do it yourself in the kitchen, things can get easier. No matter you succeed or not, feel the fun of doing experiment by yourself. syndetic biology is everywhere if only you have the love of science!

GAL80ts is a mutation based on GAL80 which is a transcription regulator in Saccharomyces cerevisiae S288C. The activity of GAL80ts is temperature dependent. At 25℃, it is activated and will bind to GAL4 then deactivate it. At 29℃, GAL80ts were inactivated and could not bind to GAL4. For the temperature between 25-29℃, we did not detect.
BBa_K2374003—ple (Tyrosine 3-monooxygenase, TH) -> (fruit fly)
ple (TH) is a rate-limiting enzyme in the dopamine’s synthesis, and it plays an important role in the physiology of adrenergic neurons.
Catalytic activity:
L-tyrosine + tetrahydrobiopterin + O2 = L-dopa + 4a-hydroxytetrahydrobiopterin.             This subpathway is part of the pathway dopamine biosynthesis, which is itself part of catecholamine biosynthesis.
BBa_K2374004—GAL4 (GALactose-responsive transcription factor)
In yeast, GAL4 regulates the GALactose metabolism. Transcriptional activation of GALactose utilization genes occurs when GAL4 binds to the upstream activation sequence (UAS) containing varying numbers of a 17-mer repeat. GAL4 binds to DNA as a dimer through a Zn(2)-Cys(6) zinc finger. The N-terminal region mediates both dimerization and DNA binding and contains a nuclear localization signal, while an acidic C-terminal domain controls transcriptional activation. GAL4 directly interacts with the Tra1 component of the SAGA complex, recruiting Mediator and the general transcriptional machinery to initiate transcription. This ability to activate transcription is retained when GAL4 is expressed in other species including plants, human cell lines, zebrafish, and Drosophila.
BBa_K2374008—UAS
An upstream activating sequence or upstream activation sequence (UAS) is a cis-acting regulatory sequence. It is distinct from the promoter and increases the expression of a neighboring gene. Due to its essential role in activating transcription, the UAS is often considered to be analogous to the function of the enhancer in multicellular eukaryotes. Upstream activation sequences are a crucial part of induction, enhancing the expression of the protein of interest through increased transcriptional activity. The UAS is found adjacently upstream to a minimal promoter ("

Le plasmide thérapeutique
Le plasmide thérapeutique a pour fonction d’exprimer le ou les gènes thérapeutiques répondant à la physiopathologie ciblée.
Il doit posséder deux caractéristiques essentielles, se faire encapsider au sein du vecteur cellulaire , le phage lambda, et avoir la capacité d’atteindre le noyau de la cellule cible.
Vous allez pouvoir découvrir au cours de ce chapitre quelles ont été les stratégies mises en place pour répondre à ces problématiques.

L’encapsidation au sein du vecteur cellulaire [1,2,3,4,5,6]
Lors du processus d’assemblage du phage lambda, l’encapsidation du génome au sein de la capside est assurée par la présence à ses extrémités de séquences spécifiques appelées séquences Cos . Ces séquences sont placées sur le plasmide thérapeutique. Et afin de garantir sa seule encapsidation au sein du vecteur cellulaire , ces dernières ont été excisées du génome phagique. De ce fait, si le vecteur cellulaire vient à infecter une bactérie de l’organisme, cela n’aboutira pas à sa destruction et à la propagation d’une quel"

Following these transformations, more reagents were prepared. Phosphate buffer solution was made by adding 1 tablet of phosphate buffered saline to 100ml milliQ water. Chaps had also been made using 0.017g chaps in 1ml of milliQ water. Lysis Buffer 1 was created using 250 µL chaps, 500 µL sucrose and made up to 10ml using the phosphate buffer.
100ml milliQ water was added to 34.2g sucrose making 1M sucrose solution.  1M imidazole was prepared by adding 0.6808g of imidazole to 10ml of milliQ water.
Purification of GFP and BFP
1ml lysis buffer was then added to pellets containing either GFP/BFP in order to resuspend the pellet. After resuspending, a Pasteur pipette was used to remove 1ml into another pellet also containing GFP or BFP. These were sonicated to split the cells open at 70% duty cycle 30seconds on and 20seconds off for 3 cycles. Samples then centrifuged for 40min. The supernatant was transferred into eppendorf tubes (2 times GFP and 2times BFP). 250 µL of resin was added to each tube and placed on suspension mixer for 20min. again, the supernatant was removed and added 1ml phosphate buffer to the remaining resin.
This was centrifuged at 500rpm for 2min and the supernatant removed with 1ml phosphate buffer being again added.  This was centrifuged at 500rpm for 2min and the supernatant removed. The pellet was resuspended with 5ml elution buffer (An elution buffer was made using 2.5ml imidazole with phosphate buffer being added resulting in a total volume of 10ml. ) again this was centrifuged for 5min at 500rpm. The resulting supernatant formed contained the GFP and BFP; this was removed.

Result of triangle model
         
Fig_model.3 and fig_model.4 are simulation results indicating a pattern which cells spread on a petri dish surface. Fig_model.3 indicates our triangle regulation model. Fig_model.4 is the result which cell movements aren't regulated.
Please compare fig_model.3 with fig_model.4. There is slight difference. In triangle regulation model, the cells stops swimming when receive individual signal. Subsequently, cells advance to cells stopped by signal which they send. So, the pattern is like fig_model.3. In no regulation model, the border of different color cells is accurately straight line. This simulation result corresponds with experiments. ( see works. )
3-D movie of three colonies
We made the movie captured dynamic change of individual colony.
Discussion
Adequacy of simulation and experiment
We wanted to get the information we cannot directly know from some experiments. How much length is needed to switch on the transcription and stop cells movement? Oppositely, if we are able to know the length, can we decide the value of some parameter such as AHL production rate? We tried to answer the question using computer simulation. But we haven’t had enough experimental results yet. Though we use some value of parameter on papers, we could not correctly decide other parameters. Simulation is just ideal. We find the fact from experiment. But simulation sometimes becomes powerful tool for helping access the fact. If we were able to make program to fit the experimental results, this approach is significant.
Future Work
Sensor Function on Agar Plate
Once both Sender and Receiver function has been confirmed and characterized, we will attempt to characterize the function of the whole system in a way that relates to our intended usage. We will spot two colonies, one of Senders and one of Receivers, on a soft agar plate and determine the maximum distance that the Senders can successfully activate the Receivers. Of course, this will only work if the AHL molecules can effectively diffuse through agar medium, which is yet another thing that we have to find out.
Amplification
There is a possibility that the upregulation of transcription downstream of Receivers will be too weak, perhaps due to insufficient AHL produced by the Senders or poor diffusion of AHL through the soft agar medium. Therefore, we shall go back to the roots of natural quorum-sensing systems by introducing a positive feedback"

A. Team Discussion
Policy and practices is a way for us to introduce our project to society. We discussed our policy and practices project first on June 23, 2014. The points of our discussion were determining our survey targets and making questionnaire design. After we shared our best ideas for the project, we decided the purpose of the project which is to introduce ECONEY to Sumbawa society and to discover more information about everything related to Sumbawa honey. Because of our questionnaire design was still not complete, we had another disscussions then we report to our instructors to get the revisions. The problems were about the question complexity and its relation to the project. And finally, our questionnaire finished on July 6th.
The next discussion was about the respondents. We determined the region target and the number of the respondents. We devided the respondents in honey production regions. We divided the respondents into producers, distributors, and consumers. We targetted to have 630 respondents which consist of 210 producers, 210 distributors, and 210 consumers using random sampling design.
B. Idea
We surveyed 16 regions consist of 7 producer regions and 9 consumer regions, while the distributors were exist in both of the areas. The producer regions located in villages. On the other hand, we choose Sumbawa Besar (the capital city of Sumbawa regency) as consumer regions. Sumbawagen team then divided into 7 teams to do the survey. Each team did the survey at 1 producer regions and 1 consumer regions. The survey was held on July"

Project Ideas
This is a list of the ideas that have been covered during the course of the first iGem meetings. Included within some of the paragraphs are links to articles which gave inspiration for that particular idea
Ideas discussed for iGEM
MAN-SCAN
Last year the Newcastle team used bacteria to detect bacteria. How about using a similar approach to detect humans? Maybe we can come up with a less androgynous title. I visualised a lawn of B. subtilis onto which you place a body part (eg hand or foot) and later an image of it appears in light.
SYNCHRO-BAC
One large colony is glowing in the dark and send a message to other colonies to do the same.
HAPPY-BACTY - general environmental monitor.
B. subtilis seems to be quite good at detecting and responding to environmental stresses (is there a thing called a stressosome?). We could ask simple questions of the colonies - is your environemnt Nice, average or poor? maybe get a three colour output (traffice lites). This kind of thing is an environmentalist dream - to detect an average of environmental stressors in theis way, such as pollutants  maybe the environmental monitor uses synchro-bac to tell the others what they are ""feeling"" and if they were motile the other could move to a nice area, or away from a bad one.
Trapping of heavy metals then sporolate to fix them indefinatley

Kun Jiang
To start our project, I begin a detailed study of biology related softwares, including  SynBioSS,CellDesigner and TinkerCell. Especially, TinkerCell is a open source software, so I can read it'source code to carefully research biology simulation software.  Those  softwares provide me a lot of ideas, direct our development and influence our design.

Learining from other biology reaction network simulation software – Berkeley Software Team  2009,SynBioSS, TinkerCell, CellDesigner, because the realization of our game need simulation too. Thinking about the big picture of our game, the simulation, the UI, the database, the play  modes.(Liao)Chen Liao promoted a way to do the simulation – every biobrick will have an input and  an output. Though following discussion proved it was not a great idea, it is a good start for  the simulation part of out game.

BCA Assay for Protein Concentrations of the Tamura Batches
Fractions 1-Strip for the dual Tamura purifications were acetone precipitated and BCA Assay was conducted to determine concentration of samples before concentration.  Fresh BSA standards are additional precipitated for assaying purposes.
Protocol for BCA Protein Assay
1. Pipette 100 μl of each protein standard (including a blank) and sample into 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tubes in triplicate.
2. Add 400 μl of cold (-20°C) acetone to each tube.
3. Vortex and incubate 30 minutes at -20°C.
4. Centrifuge 10 minutes at maximum speed in a microcentrifuge.
5. Pour off the supernatants and allow the acetone to evaporate from the tubes at room temperature (RT) for 30 minutes.
Note: If two precipitations are necessary to remove the interfering substance, repeat Steps 2-5 before proceeding.
￼￼6. Add 100 μl of ultrapure water to the protein pellets and vortex.
7. Add 1 ml of BCA Working Solution (50 parts Reagent A and 1 part Reagent B) to each tube and vortex. Incubate 30 minutes at 37°C.
8. Cool samples to RT and measure absorbance at 562 nm.
9. Plot a standard curve based on absorbance of the protein standards and determine the protein concentration of each unknown sample according to the BCA Protein Assay Kit instructions.
21 samples - 21 mL of working solution.  25 mL of Reagent A and 0.5 mL of Reagent B.  Mix to combine.  Use immediately."

Molecular Biology
For Gibson assembly, we used the NEB HiFi DNA Assembly Kit . The fragments used were obtained from IDT and/or prepared via PCR reactions using the Q5 Master Mix from New England Biolabs (NEB). Restriction Enzymes were also obtained from NEB, and we used the Fast-Ligation kit from Bio-Basic. For routine PCR reactions (such as diagnostic colony PCR), we used a PCR kit from Bio-Basic.
DNA Quantification
To quantify DNA and determine the concentration, we used an Ethidium Bromide (EtBr) Spot test. A spot of 10uL of dilute EtBr (1ng/uL) was mixed with 1uL of a DNA sample, placed over an UV lamp, and photographed. By using standards such as diluted lambda DNA at known concentrations, we generated a standard curve that allowed us to estimate the DNA in a sample. It might not have the precision of a nanodrop, but it uses the same amount of sample and is a lot less expensive! See a representative image to the right:
This protocol was adapted from the following paper: Kasap, et al (2006) Ethidium Bromide Spot Test Is a Simple Yet Highly Accurate Method in Determining DNA Concentration. Turk. J. Med. Sci 36 (6): 383-386
The formula on the standard curve can be interpreted as such:
Y values: DNA concentration
X Value: Pixel Intensity
b (Constant): Pixel Intensity with no DNA
Preparation of Media
LB Miller broth and plates were prepared by dissolving 12.5g of LB power alone (broth) or with 7.5g of Agar base (plates) into 500mL of distilled H20. The mixture was then autoclave sterilized.
Concentrated 1000X stocks of antibiotics, such as Ampicillin (Am), Kanamycin (Kn), or Chloramphenicol (Cm) were used to supplement media appropriately, and were prepared as follows:

StanfordBrownSpelman,2014,Team:StanfordBrownSpelman#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," consumption of analytical instruments, which require bulky electrical components and large fuselages to support their weight. By moving these functions into cells with biosensing capabilities – for example, a series of cells engineered to report GFP, green fluorescent protein, when conditions exceed a certain threshold concentration of a compound of interest, enabling their detection post-flight – these problems of scale can be avoided.
However, housing live cells on an aerial system presents a new set of problems, chief amongst which is the concern of horizontal gene transfer. Bacterial cells can perform conjugation, a process which allows for plasmids (small, circular strands of DNA) to be copied from one organism to another. In our case, we must take steps to protect the environment from our cells and avoid the possibility that our engineered genes proliferate throughout ecosystems. In addition, not dissimilar to the problem of mechanical UAVs getting lost or crashing and leaching toxins into the environment, we must address what might happen if our biological UAV were to crash and allow the cells on its biofilm to act as an invasive species.
We are harnessing the power of genetic engineering to mitigate both of these scenarios. To address horizontal gene transfer, we are recoding the cells on our UAV to use the UAG stop codon, which usually signals the truncation of a protein during translation, as leucine, an amino acid, instead. When we engineer the genes we wish to transform into our cells (an “amberless” strain, as UAG stop is called “amber”), all instances of UAG will be replaced with different stop codons, and all leucine residues will be coded for by UAG. Thus, any engineered genes which are passed from an amberless cell to a normal cell in the environment will not be read correctly, as each leucine residue will be instead be interpreted as “stop” and will result in the production of a non-functional protein fragment. We hope that our amberless strain can be adopted as a model for any engineered organisms one might wish to send into the environment.
Finally, to address the invasion of our cells into the environment, we are engineering a pressure-sensitive “kill switch.” Upon crash, the cells will activate quorum sensing (a method of intercellular communication), which will act as a signal to begin producing a set of proteins which can degrade the cellulose acetate base material. Much of the UAV (minus the metals) will degrade into glucose, which can be taken up by organisms in the crash environment, while the engineered cells will be killed by the free acetate, which, hopefully, will be in high enough concentration"

Next, I co-transformed toggle switch device with light sensor BBa_K1913034 and picked up the correct colony from the plate, and tested toggle switch device 1-light sensor in different LB medium with gradient guanine concentration(from 0 to 0.1mg/L) under 8h culture. But it did not work. Last, I also tried to ligate R0440+BS-yxjA-P0412 part with P1+mRFP-P0440, but it did not succeed.

Week 11 (31st August-6th September, 2016)
Firstly, I purified plasmid of BBa_B0034 and BBa_J23114(46 ng/μL, 86 ng/μL), then I digested them and did 3A assembly with pSB1C3. But the results were not correct. Next, I tried to use PCR amplify vitamin B12 riboswitch and vitamin B12 riboswitch new that was order from IDT. Then, I did gel purification and got two parts (37 ng/μL, 26.9 ng/μL). Next, I amplified BBa_K592016 and BBa_K215001 by PCR. BBa_K592016, then was digested and ligated with BBa_J23108 in pSB1C3, BBa_K215001 was sent to sequencing and it was correct. Also, I digested BBa_C0012 and BBa_C0040 and ligated them with vitamin B12 riboswitch part in pSB1A3, mRFP-P0440 part was also digested and ligated with BBa_J23108 and riboswitch BS-yxjA in pSB1K3. After I transformed ligation product into DH5α cell cultured overnight, I picked up colony the plates and checked inserted parts by PCR and cultured the correct strain. But the colony from BBa_J23108 –mRFP-P0440 plate was in white. The BBa_C0012 and BBa_C0040 with vitamin B12 riboswitch and BBa_J23108 with mRFP-P0440 are correct according to the gel electrophoresis. After these samples was sent to sequencing, only BBa_C0012"
UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Contribution_-_-_TEXT.html," directly determines the efficiency of our system. Though no successful expression of the original hydrazine dehydrase (HDH, for more information, see Notebook ) from Anammox has been reported yet, that it is a multiheme protein is clear. Therefore, we decided to try heme-containing proteins and other metal-containing proteins available in our laboratory. We tested N2H4 oxidation activity of 6 metal-containing proteins, including Degrado, 3His, Pf ferritin, DPS, CueO, and Urease (for detailed protein information, see Notebook ). Purified and assembled (for Pf ferritin and DPS, detailed assembly protocol can be found in Method ) proteins were incubated overnight with 100mM hydrazine, respectively, and hydrazine leftover was measured by adding 4-Dimethylaminobenzaldehyde and HCl to the system (for detailed protocol, see Method ). Sample N2H4·H2SO4 exhibited apparent color change and UV absorption at 454nm after such reaction (Figure 1). Significant decrease of hydrazine concentration was observed after overnight incubation with all 6 proteins. However, since CuCl2 was added in culture medium of CueO-expressing bacteria to help correct folding, and Cu2+ alone exhibited considerable catalytic activity, it was hard to measure the catalytic activity of CueO. As for urease, additional experiments showed that it was not as efficient as Pf ferritin and DPS (Figure 3). Therefore, we stopped with these two enzymes and focused on the other 4 proteins.
https://static.igem.org/mediawiki/2017/7/7d/T--UCAS--Degradation_Fig1.png
We tested the catalytic kinetics of 3His, Degrado, Pf ferritin and DPS and found that the most efficient one was Pf ferritin (Figure 4). Unfortunately, even though Pf ferritin was already the most effcicient candidate for Hydrazine Dehydrogenase (HDH), it took about an hour to reduce the concentration of hydrazine from 100uM to 50Um, which was far from efficient in general sense. In future, we will introduce point mutations into these proteins to improve their catalytic efficiency, find more multiheme proteins and test their N2H4-oxidation activity, and try to express codon-optimized HDH in E. coli.

However, this was not the main aim of the blog or twitter handle. We have primarily used has been to educate and advertise. Throughout the last 7 months, our team have posted about every aspect of our project and by doing so have raised awareness about synthetic biology and IGEM. Furthermore, by posting about our involvement in events such as the march for science and young scientists journal conference, we hope we have encouraged young people to learn more about these events.

Oxford,2018,Team:Oxford#InterLab_-_-_TEXT.html," OD600 measurements to cell concentrations and hence cell counts.
Counting colony forming units (CFUs) from the sample. Since a colony on a plate can be grown from one cell, an easy method to count how many living cells are in a particular medium would be to plate an aliquot of it and count how many colonies form. We can then use the absorbance measurements made from the same samples to convert between absorbance and CFUs.
If the data from these 2 experiments appear reproducible across the range of iGEM teams undertaking the study, we will have helped create a new powerful technique for the Synthetic Biology community as a whole.
Protocols
An important criteria for the interlab to be valid is that all teams used the same protocol in carrying out their measurements. These protocols can be found on the following link: https://static.igem.org/mediawiki/2018/0/09/2018_InterLab_Plate_Reader_Protocol.pdf
Results
Initally the transformation of all plasmids gave colonies on LB+Chlor plates but we had issues with some devices (1,4 &5) failing to grow during the 6 hour incubation periods during day 2 of the plate reader protocol. After a few attempts and the same failed results we resorted back to transforming directly from the kit plates again. By now, we were running low on many of the supplied materials - namely the kit plate plasmids and the silica beads to calibrate the plate reader. This led to us collaborating with the University of Warwick iGEM team where they gave us their spare materials and we gave them other iGEM supplied plasmids that they required which were unrelated to Interlab.
After the second round of transformations we were able to conduct the whole protocol and get results that passed common sense checks and these were what we eventually submitted.
Evaluation
After completing the Interlab project here are our thoughts:
To try to develop a protocol which ensures results can be compared between scientists, the Interlab protocol requires all the plate readers must be calibrated against known concentrations of Fluorescein. These preset concentrations resulted in high fluorescence requiring a low gain to cover the range. This  resulted in the measurements made of the cells being incredibly low, making noise an appreciable factor. Hence we would suggest either altering the preset concentrations to be lower or finding an alternative method of carrying out this calibration.
We could not understand the reasoning for growing the cells in foil-wrapped falcon tubes and felt this was an unnecessary step and time/material wasting.
We believe that since the Interlab protocol is meant be designed"

And the K1361007 was arrived in company with a parallel part where BBa_J23104,  a relatively weaker promoter, replaced the BBa_J23100. In order to find the  better fit of promoter, they helped us measure the cell growth curve of each  part and Bradford protein assay was adopted to  monitor the total quantity of secrete protein in matrix.

Collaboration  with Nankai University(NKU)
We  hosted the 1st  iGEM Exchange  Conference Of TJU Team and NKU Team on Oct. 14th at the Nankai University.
The conference contains three parts: The introduction of Work  Project, Prospect and Mutual Aid.
First of all, mediators of both teams introduced their project.  Nankai University Team introduced their project called Super Petroleum Magician  which is an anaerobic rhamnolipid-producing engineered bacterial strain for  microbial enhanced oil recovery.
And Tianjin University Team  gave a speech about their program named Transfibre which is also called CsgA, a  kind of special fiber that can bind the electric circuit and play the role as  the conductor as its function.
In the experiment part, they helped us to detect our target protein  (CsgA) using SDS-PAGE. Here is the result.
From the result, we could see that the interest protein from cells  was about 15 Kp which was same as what we expected, from which we could infer  that interest protein unsurely existed.
