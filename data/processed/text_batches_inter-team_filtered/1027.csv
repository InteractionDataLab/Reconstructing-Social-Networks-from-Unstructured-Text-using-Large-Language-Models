This year,the WLC-Milwaukee iGEM team was able to send one of our team members who was in Taiwan over the summer to the Asia Pacific iGEM Conference!
Over the course of the Conference, our attending team member received valuable feedback from teams on the operation of our system and the specifics of a color change based system. Participating teams gave and exchanged ideas during the poster and presentation sessions where we gained valuable input on the availability of other cheap test kit options in Asia that allowed us to better consider the marketing of our test kit in Asian communities. We were also able to improve the physical design of our test kit based on suggestions from various teams and the questions other teams had for the practicality of our system.
Overall, this was an exciting way for our team to collaborate with and get to know iGEMers in different regions of the world building friendships and connections that will aid in future collaboration efforts."

During our Human Practice efforts, we often faced the question “How far can a T cell migrate after being activated in a tumor microenvironment?”.  Finding an answer to this question proved to be challenging as the prediction of T cells migration is not trivial. Looking for a possible collaboration with the iGEM team from ETH Zürich, they offered us to answer this question with their modeling expertise.
As a basis for their modeling literature values for the migration behavior of T cells were used (Miller et al., 2003).
Animated simulation of CARTELTM cell behavior in- and outside the tumor microenvironment.
At the beginning of the simulation, CARTELTM cells, depicted by dots, are randomly distributed inside the tumor microenvironment (grey circle). Blue indicates a fully activated cell and yellow a cell close to deactivation. It can be observed that after leaving the tumor microenvironment fast deactivation of the the CARTELTM cells takes place. This basic model indicates that cells migrate on the average 6 mm from the tumour before getting inactivated. This on the one hand underlines the increased safety of our CARTELTM cells and on the other hand this model provides a perfect basis for further refinements.
Heidelberg
Mutagenesis rate
To improve current directed evolution approaches, iGEM team Heidelberg set out to make use of their newly designed method called PREDCEL (phage-related discontinuous evolution). For the collaboration with Heidelberg, we analyzed the mutagenesis level in E. coli containing different mutagenesis plasmids (MP1, MP2 and MP3). The plasmids  enhance the mutation rate by the inhibition of DNA repair mechanisms (Badran & Liu, 2015).
It was assumed by team Heidelberg that the mutation rate, which is several magnitudes higher in E. coli containing these mutagenesis plasmids, might vary between laboratories.
According to the data provided by team Heidelberg and literature (Badran & Liu, 2015), MP3 was supposed to have the highest mutagenesis rate, followed by MP2 and MP1. Due to these plasmids, E. coli is able to rapidly develop antibiotic resistances. To test this ability, E. coli cells were transformed with one of each of the mutagenesis plasmids and plated onto 2xYT (Yeast Extract Tryptone) plates, containing various antibiotics. After 21"
Imperial_College_London,2011,Team:Imperial College London#Extras#Collaboration_-_-_TEXT.html," other sources state that overnight growth in LB broth is sufficient. Both teams have agreed that growing overnight cultures in LB does not affect the ability of the bacteria to swim.
Another aspect of qualitative assays is semi-solid agar. Both teams have used semi-solid agar based on M9 minimal medium. Another important factor in observing chemotaxis is visualisation. The WITS-CSIR_SA team have added GFP into their construct, so visualisation of their qualitative assay was easy. However, since our construct does not contain GFP, visualisation was more difficult. WITS-CSIR_SA team have suggested to use Tetrazolium Chloride, a chemical that is metabolised by cells to produce a red pigment, and is often used as an indicator of cellular respiration.
In terms of quantitative assays, we have suggested to the WITS-CSIR_SA team that they combine a commonly-used capillary assay coupled to subsequent data collection using a flow cytometer for testing chemotactic movement as opposed to using colony forming units for the quantification of bacterial populations.
2. Dry Lab collaboration
The modellers of the Imperial College London team had several Skype meetings with the WITS-CSIR iGEM team to discuss the design of the chemotaxis modelling, and the theories behind our models. In order to share our modelling ideas and exchange some of our models, we modelled the theophylline riboswitch pathway for the WITS-CSIR_SA team. The modeling results are shown below.
2.1 Modelling results
The WITS-CSIR_SA iGEM team intend to use a riboswitch to reprogram the chemotactic behavior of E. coli. The project includes engineering the bacteria to be move towards theophylline[1]. CheZ is an important protein controlling the chemotaxis of bacteria, and WITS-CSIR_SA have used a theophylline riboswitch to control the expression of CheZ in CheZ mutants in order to engineer the bacterial movement towards theophylline[1]. They are using a riboswitch sensitive to theophylline to control the expression of CheZ. In the absence of theophylline, the start codon is covered so the translation cannot occur. In the presence of theophylline, the shape of the aptamer (riboswitch) changes and the start codon is exposed[1]. Thus, the higher the concentration of the theophylline, the more compound will enter the cell and the higher the expression of CheZ and the higher the level of directed movement will be[1]. The theophylline riboswitch"

The Plastic Problem
We live in a plastic world. From our grocery bags and disposable bottles to straws and coffee cups, plastic has become an integrated part of our everyday lives. Since plastic production started in the 1950s, more than 6.9 billion tons of plastic have become waste. According to a study in 2017, only 9% of this waste has been recycled [1]. If these products never reached the recycling plant, where did 6.3 billion tons of plastic end up? Unfortunately, the plastics that are never recycled end up in landfills, on the sides of roads, and in our lakes, rivers, and oceans.
PHOTOGRAPH BY RANDY OLSON
Because of its unique structure, plastic does not degrade. Instead, the plastic just breaks up into smaller and smaller pieces, eventually becoming microplastics. Smaller pieces of plastic and microplastics are more dangerous because they are easier for sealife to ingest. Because of the currents in the oceans, the plastic dumped in the ocean can travel around the world, leaving no place unaffected. As much as 15% of sand on certain beaches in Hawaii is made of microplastics [1].
Previous Work
In March of 2016, an article was released about the discovery of a bacterium that could degrade PET, polyethylene terephthalate. Ideonella sakaiensis 201-F6 was found to contain a PET hydrolase and a MHET hydrolase, named PETase and MHETase respectively. PETase introduced on a PET film degraded PET into MHET, a monomer of the PET chain, along with minimal amounts of terephthalic acid. In combination with MHETase, the PET film was degraded into the final products of terephthalic acid and ethylene glycol. After 6 weeks, the PET film was almost completely degraded [2].
Two years later, in April of 2018, an article was released with extensive research on wild-type PETase and select PETase mutations. The W159H/S238F double mutant of PETase showed significant improvement in crystallinity reduction and product release over the wild-type in just 96 hours. The percent crystallinity change is a result of the pitting on"

The Film Canister Cell
This fuel cell was designed to gain a better understanding of the general concept of galvanic cells and microbial fuel cells. It was used with different chemicals, yeast and the E. coli KRX strain. It also allowed to gather experience with the equipment used for measurement. The anode and cathode chambers are film canisters. Both are connected by a segment of a 15 mL centrifugation tube with a total length of two centimeters. The individual parts are held together by hot-melt glue. The centrifugation tube is filled with 3 % agarose, which acts as a salt bridge to allow protons to pass from anode to cathode chamber. In both chambers, pieces of carbon tissue (see Figure 5) act as the electrode.
Figure 5: Carbon tissue material. It shows a more flexible characteristic and seems noticeably more tearproof in comparison to carbon cloth.
Figure 6: Carbon cloth material. It shows a higher conductivity, but can be easily ruptured and therefore is difficult to mount inside the fuel cell chambers.
The biggest problem of this design is the salt bridge connecting both chambers. After being submerged in liquid for a while, it tends to become loose and glide out of the centrifugation tube. Furthermore, the construction does not allow for anaerobic operating of the fuel cell.

Connecting single batteries in series can be used to increase the output voltage. Likewise, the film canister stack consists of five film canister cells connected with copper wires in series. Because of the higher voltage generated, it was possible to operate a single low power light-emitting diode, using a high concentrated baker's yeast suspension and the exogenous mediator methylene blue in the anode chamber.

NTU Singapore iGEM Team Collaboration
Revisiting our successful collaboration with the NTU Singapore team last year, we approached them to see if this year’s team would be interested in partnering up again. After discussing our respective projects, a joint decision was made on how to best help each other.
Knowing that we have expertise in protein purification and in vitro assays, NTU incorporated His-tags into the constructs that they wanted to test and requested for us to purify and test their dCas9 constructs in vitro.
In return, knowing that the NTU team is experienced in quantitative PCR from our collaboration last year, our team was interested to know the different transcription levels of the genes within our functioning Hydrogen Gas Producing Gene Cluster plasmid this year (HGPGC) as it contains a few lac promoters within the gene cluster. We asked NTU Singapore to perform RT-qPCR after induction using IPTG to study the expression of our proteins in the gene cluster.
Our instructor delivered our HGPGC plasmid to perform RT-qPCR to the NTU team during his holiday in Singapore, and brought back the plasmids containing the clones that they were interested for us to test on his return trip.
The in vitro assay was performed on four truncated dCas9 mutants: wild type dCas9 (WT), 3P, 5P and HNH. This project used the dCas9 enzyme to form a Ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex with gRNA, and subsequently bind to the target sequence in our PCR product (similar to what we did last year). The results from the electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) show that the dCas9 mutants (WT,3P, 5P and HNH) were successfully truncated (Figure 1), and no longer retain their nuclease activity (see Figures 2,3). This is evident from the gel shift present, the shift of the target sequence protein and the presence of gRNA, indicating the mutant dCas9 has bound the target sequence of DNA from its slower migration through the gel (see Figure 2).

Through their RT-PCR expertise, NTU Singapore aided us in"

As is shown in the graph, this system can be reasonably considered as a TCS. The amount of NtrC-Pi (Conc) and NtrB-Pi (Conb) are two key parameters of this system. Four factors influence Conc and Conb: NtrB helps NtrC’s phosphorylation, NtrC starts the production of NtrB, Conb reduction caused by PII and constant NtrC production. Also, it should not be neglected that the inherent degradation of NtrC and Ntrb is in proportion to their own concentration.
Thus, the evolution equation of this system can be written as:
Where y0 can be expressed as:
The four parameters b, c, y0, x0 invited here respectively represent the velocity of the four processes mentioned before. To be emphasized,y0 describing the change of Conb caused by PII. Parameters a, d is the coefficient of proportionality between Conc or Conb and its depredating velocity. This is a differential equation and the evolution process could be treated as a Markov Process*.
Here we apply methods from dynamic system to conduct further analysis:
First, Consider evolution matrix A, calculate the eigenvalue λ of A
Solve this equation, get
and the eigenvector is
Since parameters a, d are relatively small compared with c, b and they are both negative, it can be easily spotted thatλ1>0,λ2<0 and the ordinate of the vector I1>0 while that of I2<0. If we temporarily put aside the parameters x0, y0 and the definition domain of Conc and Conb, this system could be explained and predicted by the phase flow graph shows below.
Every curve in the graph is an orbit of the system with different initial Conc and Conb. This means that the system with certain initial condition evolves alongside the curve that passes through that point. Thus, with any certain set of parameters, we can determine how the system evolves according to the graph.
So how to draw this graph? How to calculate the function of the curves in the graph? If we consider a system with the evolving law written as
Rewrite r(t) using the eigenvector I1, I2, defined vector X=(Conc, Conb)
Take this back into the differential equation, after simplify, get

It can be assumed that this large interdisciplinary and highly collaborative team work was the first experience of this kind for the majority of students and therefore a great experience for all participants. It is remarkable that the project was always focused on the overall goal to obtain a useful product at the end rather than endlessly discussing tiny details of each aspect.
As assumed at the very beginning, this was an enormously challenging effort, but all participants made this project a success. To me, it is still amazing how all this could be achieved in this short time and while in parallel educating the undergraduate students in so many disciplines.

In this summer, I donated my efforts on helping UCSD iGEM team to set up a new modeling format which modularized devices as individual function and standardized the function’s structure. Based on the concept of iGEM, we started from building up dozens of sub-functions that represents a set of simple devices which were the fundamental bio-brick in synthetic biology. Then we searched some literatures and picked up a system for testing our novel modeling method. Two arrays of ODEs were defined for representation of the circuits we chose. A python script was written to integrate these ODEs.
As result, the plot from wet-lab experimental data was reproduced by our differential equations. The simulative output approximately matches the curve plotted in citation which  shows the idea that modeling single devices and linking them as connecting bio-brick works like we expected. In next step, we tried to plugin this function into our web app but we didn’t finish because time was over. It is hopefully to be done in future.

uOttawa,2017,Team:uOttawa#HP#Gold Integrated_-_-_TEXT.html," strain of yeast and is not introduced to the wild strain.
Regardless, we follow the following stringent confinement strategies:
Molecular: The components of the system are not adjacent. dCas9 is in a plasmid, while the gRNAs will be integrated directly to the yeast genome. Study is performed on a mutant strain, not a wild strain. No genetic parts are produced commercially. We use homologous recombination to construct our entire network.
Ecological: Study is performed in a sterilized and confined laboratory environment, outside the habitable range of the host organism. The area contains no potential wild mates.
Barrier: Our transformations are performed in sterilized, low-temperature environment. Because our project does not consist of a gene drive, neither does our BioBrick.
Experience with dCas9
Our lab setting has previous experience working with synthetic gRNA networks. We have undergone necessary biosafety training from the Office of Risk Management - Environmental Health & Safety (ORM). We have thus fully assessed the project and have concluded that it is safe. Lois Sowden-Plunkett, Assistant Director, Biosafety, Radiation Safety and Laser Safety, whose contact information is given below has allowed us to proceed with the project. We are also in contact with Miles Gander, expert on dCas9-involving circuits and author of ""Digital logic circuits in yeast with CRISPR-dCas9 NOR gates"" (DOI: 10.1038/ncomms15459) from the University of Washington.
Conclusion
Despite using dCas9 to construct a NOR gate, no gene drive is created. By following the due process, we were able to design a project that is safe for the lab team and the greater community. Furthermore, by thoroughly understanding the established safety procedures we were able to gain insight into the policy surrounding research. uOttawa iGEM has an ongoing commitment to promoting safe research environments for the students and community.
Let’s Talk Science
In an effort to extend our reach into our university and city communities, the University of Ottawa iGEM Human Practices Team partnered up with Let's Talk Science for the 2017 season. Let's Talk Science is an award-winning, national organization that creates and delivers programs to engage youth and educators in science, technology, engineering and math (STEM). As a team, we recognized that our interests as Policy and Practices overlapped with the interests of Let's Talk Science in educating youth about the possibilities that science, including the field of synthetic biology, brings. We established communication with the Ottawa Chapter of Let's Talk Science and a great partnership was established for the "
Waterloo,2013,Team:Waterloo_-_-_TEXT.html," the original message, once received by primary receivers, was assumed to be 30 mins. Initial populations of senders, primary receivers, and secondary receivers were assumed to be 1000, 10000, and 1000 cells/mL respectively.
Figure 3. Effects of genomic tinkering on system outputs. The viral particle production efficiency in primary receivers, as a percentage of efficiency in senders, plotted against the ratio of secondary receivers that received Mmod vs Mori.
We see that sensitivity is highest when efficiency is low. As expected, increasing efficiency always leads to more successful delivery of M¬mod to secondary receivers. For the parameters used, an efficiency of approximately 0.3 is required for an equal proportion of P2 mod and P2 ori.
Effect of Initial Populations on Receipt of Modified Message
The aim of this system is receipt of Mmod by secondary receiver cells. Mmod can only be produced by primary receivers that are infected with Mori. In a sense, the message must “pass through” the primary receivers before it can get to the secondary receivers. We thus suspect that an increase in the initial population of primary receivers will improve system performance.
To confirm this, we simulated the system with varied initial populations for senders and primary receivers. The system performance measure was the ratio of secondary receivers that receive Mmod vs Mori, expressed as P¬2 mod/P2 ori, measured at the time when all secondary receiver cells have received a message. We also kept track of the simulated time required (Figure 4). For these simulations, modification and retransmission were induced; the half-life of the switch in the original message, once received by primary receivers, was assumed to be 30 mins; and the rate of particle production in primary receivers was assumed to be 50% of the rate in senders.
Figure 4. Initial populations of senders and primary receivers plotted against the ratio of secondary receivers that received Mmod vs Mori.
As expected, we note that the system is most efficient in delivering Mmod to secondary receivers when the primary receiver population is high and the sender population is low, so that the majority of phage particles carry Mmod. We also note that very low initial populations of senders results in a longer time taken to “infect” all secondary receivers with DNA messages.
Sensitivity to Basal Expression of Integrase in Primary Receivers
A key concern in this system is the reliability of the switch on the messaging phagemid. The switch must flip when modification and retransmission is induced, but must hold state when uninduced.
When induced, we expect the"

Failsafes and TroubleShooting
The next problem that could occur with our RNA based gene therapy system is the potential mutation to the DNA that codes for the editing system. The solution to a mutant of our system could be addressed simply by the patient to stop taking doxycycline, as the expression of the dCas9 system uses a Tet-on system, requiring the presence of tetracycline or a derivative (doxycycline).  However, if a mutation occurs that allows for the gene’s expression without doxycycline, then a kill switch will be needed. One concept for a kill switch is the use of a separate section of DNA coding for another dCas9. This dCas9 would target the DNA sequence where transcription starts or some section of the gene containing the dCas9 of the RNA modifying machine. Experimentation has shown that dCas9 has a high efficiency rate at silencing its target gene.3 Binding to the DNA will prevent or cause early termination of transcription, stopping the mutant gene from being expressed. Similarly, the dCas9 could be replaced with two active Cas9 molecules that could break or cut out a section of the mutated gene, breaking it.4 Both of these systems could be controlled by another artificial molecule like CNO or another antibiotic.The downside to these systems is that, if the target DNA sequence of the silencing dCas9 or Cas9 molecules is mutated to a certain point, it may no longer be recognized by the silencing CRISPR/Cas9 molecule. To counter this problem, multiple Cas9 molecules targeting different parts of the gene of interest could be included, or have the Cas9 molecules target a specific sequence that the gene requires to allow transcription. Alternatively, the Cas9 systems could also be replaced with a Zinc Fingers based editing molecule, or even a repressor molecule that is activated by the presence of Tetracycline TetR.5 Finally, the use of chimeric DNA MTases using Cys2His2 zinc finger systems can be potentially used to silence the gene of interest by methylating the promoter region. This would permanently silence the gene, while the other silencing methods can be reversed. It should be considered that this system could cause the unintentional silencing of other genes if the targeting sequence of system is mutated, causing further potential problems with the cell.6 The last stage kill switch that could"

With a set of the primers that has just arrived, we were able to PCR amplify certain parts that will be able to be Gibson assembled. On the plasmid that has RFP (a modified BBa_K093012, placed on the Psb1C3), we wanted to put arabinose inducible MetA or arabinose inducible TyrA. However, one of the primers necessary to amplify the plasmid itself, which would be necessary to incorporate the proper homologous sequence for Gibson assembly, did not arrive. Additionally, the PCR to amplify the MetA gene did not work the first time, but has been repeated. The arabinose promoter was successfully PCR'd out of the E. coli genome for both cases.  For the plasmid with YFP, the BBa_I13973, we wanted to put rhamnose inducible TrpA or TyrA after the YFP gene. We received all the primers necessary for this, but the PCR for the plasmid backbone gave several bands and was repeated at a higher annealing temperature. The results are not yet known. The rhamnose promoter was successfully PCR'd out of the genome, as was the TrpA gene. However, we lacked one of the promoters for the TyrA gene. Since there were several bands for the YFP plasmid, we did not do a Gibson assembly. Additionally, it is possible that the primers were designed for the pSB1C3 rather than the pSB1A2, but that"

• S. cerevisiae : YPH500
None of them is known to be toxic to aquatic systems, environment or organisms. [1]
The plasmids used were:
• pSB1C3, pSB1A3, pSB1K3
high copy plasmids carrying the antibiotic resistances to Ampicillin, Kanamycin and Chloramphenicol
These resistances are commonly used as markers and listed on the white list [1] .
• pYES2/CT
Commonly used Yeast expression vector with Uracil auxotrophy
• pSB4A5
low copy BioBrick standard vector with  ampicillin resistance
For the experiments in yeast the backbone pYES2/CT is used. It contains a galactose inducible promotor. Without galactose none of the inserted DNA can be expressed.  The final product in both E. coli and yeast is the hormone Auxin. Auxin is naturally expressed in plants and in small amounts in yeast, where it triggers growth and differentiation of cells. It is neither harmful to people nor the environment if accidentally released.
General Guidelines
In Germany there are many restrictions concerning scientific work with genetically modified organisms (GMOs). In the GenTSV and the GenTG (eng. genetic engineering safety ordinance and genetic engineering law) regulate what is generally forbidden in Germany/in the European Union (EU) and which safety precautions have to be observed. GMOs are defined as “genetically modified organisms, whose genetic material has been altered by molecular biology methods, in a way that would naturally not be possible by breeding or recombination”[1]. We also paid attention to the safety indications given by the iGEM foundation.
Their safety sheets made us aware that the used DNA binding protein dCas9 requires special treatment.
In addition to these guidelines there are regulations in our lab that are set by the university to protect the experimenter and other people in the building. A short summary of those rules, that were explained during an obligatory safety instruction, may be found under “Lab safety”.
In our lab there is a special disposure system that distinguishes between normal waste (paper, packaging, uncontaminated plastic waste), biohazardous waste (might have been in contact with GMOs), chemical waste (e.g. EtBr) and glass. Every kind of waste is treated differently. This way, neither the environment, nor other lab technicians or cleaning staff risk their health while working in the lab.

A 585nm-595nm 1W LED light bead, with the rated voltage around 2.0V, is applied in our hardware. Two 1kΩ resistors were put in series with the LED to reduce the voltage across it, as our circuit board can only provide 5V output.
To sense the fluorescence, we installed a LDR (light dependent resistor) sensor of LXD55 series, whose resistance ranges from 8 to 20 kΩ in brightness (10 Lux), and 1MΩ in darkness (0 Lux) with response time of around 20ms. A 10kΩ resistor is in series with the LDR sensor to divide the voltage, and then the resistance value of sensor is collected by the circuit board.
We printed some small components in this part to fix or support the items mentioned above, with the 3D printer.
Control System
An Arduino Nano V3.0 board is employed to control the whole equipment. It is powered by a battery and provides 5V output to different parts. Meanwhile it collects the signal from LDR sensor and transports it to the Bluetooth module, and later sends to user’s phone.
Five relays under the control of Arduino Nano separately regulate the power supplies of the pumps, the LED, the LDR sensor, and the Bluetooth module. We chose Risym 5V electromagnetic relay which could bear up to DC30V/10A.
For transmitting signal we applied HC-60 wireless Bluetooth module.
Firstly we plan to apply a much more complex design, which required us to 3D-print the total equipment. In fact it is difficult for our machine to print such a large box. Thus we simplified it and decided to only print some small components and use a relatively flat PC box to hold all the parts. The heaviest item, the battery, is put on the bottom and the whole detection system is placed at the corner, to stabilize the equipment.
Measurement
Different parameters of the hardware were acquired through a series of experiments. We attached importance to the performance of filter membrane, investigating the efficiency of filtration of bacteria and flow velocity. The working state of the pumps and the LED light bead were checked. And we conducted experiments to simulate the expected working condition of our hardware, to inquiry whether it functions well when floating in the ponds.

    Having been found in many ecological niches, such as waste from petrochemical effluents and honey, B. megaterium is able to grow on a wide variety of carbon sources. Its degradation of persistent insecticides was also documented in 1987 and 1989, suggesting its potential application as detoxifying agent.
    What's more, industrial application of B. megaterium for vitamin B12 biosynthesis is an excellent example for development of a production strain using synthetic biological method[3][4]. There're also many other advantages of B. megaterium to make it an employable candidate for biological studies.
2,4,6- trichlorophenol
    2,4,6-trichlorophenol is a halogenated organic, phenol-structured and chlorinated in ortho- and para-position of the hydroxyl group.
    It has been used as fungicide, herbicide, insecticide, antiseptic and glue preservation.
    United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has classified it as a Group B2, probable human carcinogen[5].
Membrane bioreactor
    Membrane bioreactor (MBR) is a membrane process combined with the activated sludge process. It has many advantages over conventional process and is now widely used in industrial and municipal wastewater treatment.
    In brief, the overall MBR process can be described as microbial fermentation to treat pollutants and microfiltration or ultrafiltration to prevent large particles and microorganisms.
    On that basis, hybrid membrane bioreactor (HMBR) was developed by introducing biofilm carriers into a conventional MBR and thus increased the total biomass. This not only improves the efficiency of biodegradation but may also contribute to the removal of small biological filaments and colloidal matter.
Surface display system[6]
    Surface display is a method to present target proteins on cell surfaces by membrane anchoring domain.
    Take BclA protein for example. It's derived from Bacillus anthracis (34F2) that covers the spores of B. anthracis. Although totally being 21 amino acid long, BclA is known to carry passenger proteins up to 120kDa.When expressed on the outer membrane"

Restriction digest of yesterday’s miniprep product
Procedure:
Gel separation and purification of digested PCR-amplified dCas9 and pSB1C3
4 μL loading dye was added to the digested PCR-amplified dCas9 and pSB1C3 backbone and the total volume of the samples (24 μL) were run on a 0.8% agarose gel containing GelGreen. The bands at approximately 5000 bp and 2000 bp for dCas9 and pSB1C3, respectively, were excised from the gel. The plasmid fragments were further purified following the ZymocleanTM Gel DNA Recovery protocol, using 480 μL and 210 μL ADB buffer for dCas9 and pSB1C3 backbone, respectively. The concentration and quality of the products were measured using the Nanodrop.
Restriction digest of plamids isolated from colonies
Yesterday’s miniprepped plasmids from the bacterial cultures with potentially correctly ligated dCas9 into the pSB1C3 backbone were nanodropped and digested with EcoRI-HF and PstI at 37 °C for about 2 hours. The products was ran on a 0.8% agarose gel containing GelRed"

SAFETY ORGANISMS
Our experiment is entirely safe, involving no pathogenic materials, environmental release and animal/human testing. We use Escherichia coli DH5 alpha as our chassis organism. From a recent study, E. coli DH5 alpha has been determined that it lacks several genes for known E. coli pathogenicity factors. We also use Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 in our experiment and it has been also shown no harmful effect to human nor the environment in the literature. Both bacteria are grouped under the risk group 1.
HUMAN PRACTICES RESEARCH
Our team had collected surveys from the public in regards to their concerns and opinions when using renewable energy. The only personal information we have collected in the survey are the age group expressed in range, and educational levels. There are no record of individual identity that one can trace. These information collected wile solely help us to analyse how the view point varies according to the different age groups. All interviewees are notified that the results from this survey will be used for us to see how we can modify our MFC according to the public's needs. All information we have collected will be destroyed after the duration of iGEM 2018.
TRAINING AND ENFORCEMENT
Training: All team members who work in the wet lab must have completed the safety training organized by Health, Safety, and Environment Office (HSEO) at the HKUST by completing a theoretical test regarding the safety concern.
The safety training we learnt:
-  Biological Safety
-  Chemical Safety I – Chemical Safety for Laboratory Users
-  Chemical Safety II – Hazardous Waste Management

The Biohacker Kit
The premise of this project was to create a linked two plasmid system to create a bio-system whose inputs and outputs can be easily swapped. The purpose of this system is to create a means by which students can be easily introduced to synthetic biology (the design and re-design of biological systems for useful purposes) in their classrooms without the need for high-tech, expensive equipment.
How It Works
The system uses two different types of plasmids (pACYC184 as the input plasmid and pBR322 as the output plasmid). The input plasmid had the promoter gene along with a phage activator ligated into it, and the reporter promoter had a phage promoter and a reporter gene ligated into it. When the promoter is activated, it will trigger the phage activator. The phage activator will then activate the phage promoter in the output plasmid, which will turn on the output gene. In this way, there could be a whole palate of input and output plasmids that can be mixed and matched at the students' will to easily create their own individual systems. The two plasmids have different antibiotic resistances so that one can tell when their programmed plasmids have been successfully transformed into cells, along with different origins of replication. Using two different antibiotic resistances will help ensure that the colonies have both plasmids co-transformed inside the E. coli cells.
Figure 1: Two plasmid system, using the UV promoter as an input and GFP as the output
The Biohacker Kit would be a box that schools could buy that contained all of the input and output constructs. The lab work involved would be to co-transform the input and output of the student's choice with E. coli cells, and plate them on the correct antibiotic plates. After overnight incubation, the students can see all of the colonies and then activate the promoter to kick-start the system. Then, depending on the promoter, over the next day or two the system will begin to express the reporter"

Upon induction with arabinose, TrpA is expressed for indole-3-glycerol-phosphate(InGP)binding and catalysis/cleavage of InGP to indole and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate during an α reaction. This construct can be used to induce growth in Trp- auxotrophs and can be monitored by fluorescence for its population dynamics in co-culture with other auxotrophs. Main Page - Constitutive EYFP generator - Arabinose inducible MetA coding gene, BBa_K804011: This part contains a constitutive EYFP generator along with an arabinose inducible (Pbad) Met A coding gene. Upon induction with arabinose, MetA is expressed for for the biosynthesis of de novo methionine. It encodes for the MetA enzyme which transfers a succinyl group from succinyl-CoA to homoserine, forming O-succinyl-L-homoserine, a precursor of methionine. This construct can be used to induce growth in Met- auxotrophs and can be monitored by fluorescence for its population dynamics in co-culture with other auxotrophs.

E. coli BL21(DE3) without any plasmid shows the best growth, with the highest specific growth rate and the highest final OD600 of 5.178 ± 0.046. The second negative control, E. coli BL21(DE3) harboring pSB1C3-PtNTT2 (BBa_K2201004) reached the second highest OD600 with 4.638 ± 0.029. Of the functional PtNTT2 variants, strains harboring pSB1C3-PlacUV5-PtNTT2(66-575) (BBa_K2201001) and pSB1C3-PlacUV5-pelB-SP-PtNTT2 (BBa_K2201006) reached the highest ODs with 4.397 ± 0.062 and 4.171 ± 0.051, respectively. E. coli BL21(DE3) pSB1C3-PlacUV5-PtNTT2(31-575) (BBa_K2201005) showed similar growth to the two previous strains during the lag phase and early exponential phase, but reaching a lower OD600 of 3.802 ± 0.135. E. coli BL21(DE3) pSB1C3-PlacUV5-PtNTT2 (BBa_K2201000) and E. coli BL21(DE3) pSB1C3-PlacUV5-TAT-SP-PtNTT2 (BBa_K2201007) grew significantly weaker compared to all previous strains, with a lag phase nearly four hours long and final ODs of 2.499 ± 0.134 and 2.735 ± 0.150, respectively. The difference in growth between the two negative controls can be explained by the metabolic burden caused by plasmid replication and expression of the chloramphenicol resistance. Therefore, E. coli BL21(DE3) pSB1C3-PtNTT2 is the more accurate control, since all samples contain the same plasmid backbone and were also grown in LB media supplemented with chloramphenicol. The difference in growth between strains expressing the native, full length transporter and the truncated version PtNTT2(66-575), observed by Zhang et al."

Hamburg,2016,Team:Hamburg#HP#Gold_-_-_TEXT.html," the man. This is highly entrenched in our culture. So if you are a man you are raised thinking that you have to take care of a woman. So that’s the problem. Because of illiteracy acquisition of knowledge and technology is very slow. And also with other believes and needs associated with eye health it highly complicates matters. Thatˋs why women are affected by disease.
Daniel C.:
How is the distribution of doctors in the field? Do people in the villages go to the doctor when there is something wrong or do you have to go and check?
David Chinyanya:
They go if there is something wrong with them. Medical [...] behavior is not yet there entrenched in us.They usually go to a hospital with a problem. Nobody will come to a doctor to ask to get his eyes checked. During my practice nobody came to me to just get his eyes checked. When you see them coming to you, they have a problem. The other issue is why is it like that? Maybe doctors are very few. So if somebody comes to me and says: “I just wanted my eyes to be checked” I would say : “Please wait, I want to check on the one that is sick”.
Daniel C.:
So you often diagnose the disease when itˋs in a late stage?
Michael Masika:
Yes, because of the illiteracy thing that is there. A lot of them come to us when itˋs already late. But it is not supposed to be like that, because when someone comes to me with a corneal scar certainly to trichiasis they are not supposed to come to me at that stage. They should have seen the problem somewhere four, five years ago. But if the people come with that corneal scars secondary to trichiasis, it means that the thing has been there for some time. Because if they came earlier we would have corrected the trichiasis.
Daniel C.:
And then you have to operate.
Michael Masika:
Yes. If they come at that stage you have to operate just to relieve the symptoms and signs but not to regain the sight. But when they came earlier on,we could have prevented the progression of the disease.
David Chinyanya:
In addition to that, of course our health system is also growing, progressing. Eye health specialists or clinicians, [there] are not many in the country. Very few. He (Michael Masika) is in charge of that, he can actually count for you. At least at one point he told me, that there are 69. And"

Atlanta Maker Faire: Building With Biology
Lambert iGEM's booth at the Maker Faire
The Maker Faire is a one day event where scientists, engineers and other “makers” gather to promote their craft to the public. Lambert iGEM hosted a booth where the public could learn about synthetic biology. The activities we provided were from a kit provided by Building with Biology, a foundation dedicated to the education of synthetic biology to the public. Lambert iGEM informed the public about synthetic biology utilizing models of ClpXP demonstrating its function in protein degradation. The Chrome-Q was also showcased as a cheaper option to the plate reader for underfunded labs. In addition, the team asked the children that stopped at the Lambert iGEM booth ”why are you interested in science?” Along with hosting a booth, the team was inspired by other Makers in the Atlanta area, including the Decatur Maker Space, whom are opening their own DIY Bio lab. The Lambert iGEM was able to discuss opportunities for the upcoming Spring.  The team will be hosting training nights to help teach standard protocols in cloning to the interested public.

HIT-Harbin,2014,Team:HIT-Harbin#WholeNameList_-_-_TEXT.html," association data to screen rice Hsps, the expression patterns of which strongly correlate with those of heat responsive probe-sets. Twenty-seven Hsp candidates were verified, including 12 small Hsps, six Hsp70s, three Hsp60s, three Hsp90s, and three clpB/Hsp100s. Then, using a combination of interolog and expression profile-based methods, we identified 430
interactorsofHsp70 family members in rice, and validated the interactions by co-localization and function-based methods. Subsequently, 13 interacting domains and 28 target motifs were over-represented in Hsp70sinteractors. Twenty-four GO terms of biological processes and five GO terms of molecular functions were enriched in the positive Hsp70 interactors, which expression levels were positively associated with Hsp70s. Analyzing the interaction network of Hsp70s, we found that Hsp70s were involved in macromolecular translocation, carbohydrate metabolism, innate immunity, photosystem II repair and regulation of kinase ac tivities.
Hsp26.7, Hsp23.2, Hsp17.9A, Hsp17.4 and Hsp16.9A were up-regulated in r ice (Orya sativa L. & Nipponbare) during seedling and anthesis stages in response to heat stress. Subsequently, the expression level of five sHsps in the heat-tolerant rice cultivar, Co39, were all significantly higher than that in the heat-susceptible rice cultivar, Azucena, indicating that the expression level of these five sHsps was positive related to the ability of rice plants to avoid heat stress. Thus, the expression level of these five sHsps can be regarded as bio-markers for screening rice cultivars with different abilities to avoid heat stress. Hsp18.1, Hsp17.9A, Hsp17.7 and Hsp16.9A, in the three rice cultivars under heat stress were found to be involved in one protein complex by Native-PAGE, and the interactions of Hsp18.1 and Hsp 17.7, Hsp18.1 and Hsp 16.9A, Hsp17.7 and Hsp16.9A were further validated by yeast 2-hybridization. Pull down assay also confirmed the interaction between Hsp17.7 and Hsp16.9A in rice under heat stress. In conclusion, the up-regulation of the 5 s"

This set-up was repeated with cells containing an identical plasmid and construct, except sfGFP was in place of deGFP. As a control, untransformed cells were also prepared identically except the LB did not contain chloramphenicol. Tubes with only LB and LB+chloramphenicol were also prepared as blanks. The cultures were shake-incubated at 37oC. 300 μL samples from each tube were taken at time points of 15 mins, 2 hours, 4 hours, and 6 hours and stored at 4oC until the end of the experiment. 100 μL of each sample were then added to a 96-well plate. Fluorescence (excitation 485 nm, emission 510 nm) and absorbance (OD600 nm) were measured using a BMG-Labtech fluostar optima plate reader. Fluorescence intensity and grow rates for all three cell types were calculated over time (Figure 3). It was found that while cells expressing sfGFP had a much higher fluorescence intensity than cells expressing deGFP, the growth rate for cells with deGFP was closer to that of untransformed cells. This suggests that in vivo, either deGFP has lower expression than sfGFP, or each molecule of deGFP emits less fluorescence.
Figure 3: a) fluorescence intensity of E. coli cells overtime. Each bar represents an average of three repeats, and error bars represent +/- standard error. Fluorescence intensity was negative corrected to LB media. b) growth rate of E. coli cells over time. Each bar represents an average of three repeats, and error bars represent +/- standard error. OD¬600 was negative corrected to LB media.

We discussed the pros and cons of having a standing ethics committee versus  having a temporary one. On one hand, a standing ethics committee is not limited by  time. They are able to carry out long term projects that span throughout the terms of  multiple Presidents. However, a standing committee would likely have elected members,  or members appointed by Presidents from different parties. As a result, the committee  would likely face the same type of gridlock that we often see in politics today. A  temporary committee with appointed members, on the other hand, does not have to deal  with standstills and can sometimes get more accomplished even when limited by time.  Our conversation with Dr. Lee was very informative. We learned a lot about how PCSBI  and other ethics committees work. Dr. Lee also gave us a lot to consider about whether  it is better to have a standing ethics committee or a temporary committee, and she  provided us insight into the political facet of science and ethics, something that we had  never thought about before. Additionally, she recommended we contact the Woodrow  Wilson International Center for Scholars for more information regarding follow-ups to the  recommendations made in New Directions: the Ethics of Synthetic Biology and  Emerging Technologies.
James Wagner
In 2010, the Presidential Commission for the Study of Bioethical Issues (PCSBI)  issued a report titled New Directions: the Ethics of Synthetic Biology and Emerging  Technologies providing recommendations for the responsible and ethical use of  synthetic biology. We had the pleasure of speaking to Dr. James Wagner, former Vice  Chair of PCSBI, to better understand the reasoning behind the Commission’s  recommendations in New Directions.
In our conversation with Dr. Wagner, we were interested in learning whether his  views on the Commission’s recommendations have changed in the six years since they  were issued, especially given the rapid developments in synthetic biology in recent  years. Dr. Wagner explained to us that the Commission was pro-science and recognized  the potential benefits of science for society. However, they wanted to ensure any risks to  society are also minimized. Thus, the Commission recommended broad principles such  as public beneficence and responsible stewardship to provide flexibility in the document  while simultaneously investing in science. Furthermore, Dr. Wagner emphasized the"

Leaky Expression by the OmpR-Regulated Promoter on Different Vectors
Leaky expression by the OmpR-regulated promoter is reduced when cloned into a low copy vector compared to a high copy vector.
Proper regulation of the OmpR-dependent promoter, BBa_R0082 , is necessary for the implementation of a functional dormancy system, as the balance between RelE and RelB is imperative. To verify that the OmpR-regulated promoter is up to the task, a reporter system containing RFP under control of the OmpR-regulated promoter, BBa_M30011 , was cloned into E. coli strain SØ928 ΔompR, lacking the OmpR transcription factor, on a high copy vector. By using a ΔompR strain, the background generated by stimulation of the intrinsic OmpR system is removed, and the strain functions as a negative control.
RFP expression was assessed by fluorescence microscopy using an Olympus IX83 with a photometrics prime camera, set to an excitation at 550 nm, emission at 573-613 nm, and exposure time at 500 ms. Assessing the RFP expression by fluorescence microscopy, it was discovered that the OmpR-regulated promoter mediated gene expression even in the absence of its transcription factor, see Figure 17. This observation was confirmed by going through the literature Levskaya A, Chevalier AA, Tabor JJ, Simpson ZB, Lavery LA, Levy M, et al. Synthetic biology: engineering Escherichia coli to see light. Nature. 2005;438(7067):441-2. .
Figure 17. Fluorescence microscopy of RFP controlled by the OmpR-regulated promoter on a high copy vector in E. coli strain SØ928 ΔompR.
On the basis of this finding, the relE gene controlled by the OmpR-regulated promoter required a low copy plasmid or insertion into the chromosome. Protein expression of RFP in pSB1C3 with a copy number of 100-300 plasmids per cell, and pSB3K3 with a copy number of 10-12 plasmids per cell, was studied by flow cytometry. As for the determination of noise levels in the weak, BBa_J23114 , and strong BBa_J23102 constitutive promoters, the experiment was carried out in both LB medium and M9 minimal medium, the latter supplemented with"

Originally painted in 1917 by Tom Thompson, The Jack Pine is a symbolic work of art, representing one of Canada's most iconic native pine trees, found east of the Rocky Mountains. It is not to be confused with Canada's most well known broad-leaf Maple, for which the country is famous. The scene depicted is at evening with a serene backdrop into the fading light. Tom Thompson was a forerunner to the Group of Seven before its inception had even been brought about, such was the influence of this iconic painting.
M.C. Escher was a woodcut artist, making art from trees. Here we have recreated his work by streaking media with Escherichia coli to form one of his art pieces, the Palm. Escher was a dutch artist and completed the xylograph in 1933. Xylographs are produced by etching and carving an image into a block of wood. The non-printing parts are removed and the printing process can commence, allowing the printing of the Palm to be done in black and white.

Part submission tim ITB_Indonesia for production module, Rhamnolipid
Source: http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K1685011
There are two enzymes responsible for rhamnolipid production in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The first enzyme, RhlA, catalyses dimerization of two hydroxyacyl (usually hydroxydecanoyl) chains that will constitute rhamnolipid’s lipid moiety, HAA. RhlB will catalyse the transfer of rhamnose and HAA forming mono-rhamnolipid.
We utilise The Biosurfactor biobrick (BBa_K653000) designed by Panama 2011 that encodes rhlA and rhlB. We put the biobrick under T7lac promoter with strong RBS, and double terminator.
Our chassis for production is E. coli BL21 (DE3). In its genome, it has a T7 coding gene under pLac promoter.
E. coli produces LacI protein to control expression of genes under Lac promoter. LacI will bind into the lac operator, and inhibit the expression of T7.
When lactose is available, it will bind into LacI protein. The binding causes the LacI to dissociate from lac operator.
Without the inhibition from LacI, T7 polymerase will be expressed
The absence of LacI binding to the operator lac in our construct plus the presence of T7 polymerase will allow the expression of our gene which is under T7 promoter. Therefore, rhlAB gene will be expressed to produce rhlA and rhlB enzymes. These enzymes will then produce the rhamnolipid.

UTIs are caused by uropathogenic bacteria that invade the cells lining the bladder and form biofilms. It was here that our focus turned, particularly as this was in accordance with our survey results and linked in well with the microbiome topic that had been popular previously. This meeting marked a change of direction for our project, meaning we had to return straight back to the drawing board. We were then faced with the question:
How could synthetic biology be used to better solve a problem that science and medicine is currently failing to address?
A BACKSTORY
Bacteria do mean business; however, before there was any notion of what business this may be and how we could incorporate it into our project, we first had to establish a team. Last year, the Oxford iGEM team had to set up everything from scratch as the University had never entered the competition before. Their project did very well, winning them a gold medal in Boston. It was last year's team which began the process of starting iGEM 2015. Once they had sparked interest, they set up some preliminary meetings so that we could start to finalise a team, and come up with a strategy for what we would do over the Christmas vacation.
During the vacation, we surveyed the general public so that we could find out their opinions on synthetic biology, what we could do to improve its profile, and how they wanted synthetic biology to help them. The responses we got to our surveys were truly diverse and, at times, reflected the public's lack of understanding about what synthetic biology can and cannot do. Duke received a response suggesting that we use synthetic biology to stop racism. While we're confident in synthetic biology's huge potential, we weren't sure whether it extended quite this far. There were also numerous suggestions that we ""create"" more energy, showing to us that perhaps more effort is needed to educate the public on the first law of thermodynamics.
Despite these scientifically unsound suggestions, we gathered that the public would love to see synthetic biology being put to use in the areas of environment and medicine, particularly in relation to global warming and antibiotic resistance. We each presented on an idea based on our surveys and voted on the top 6 topics. These were SPACE as proudly presented by Sam, using the human microbiome (which later evolved into our actual project) by Raffy, metal extraction by Leon, desalination by Duke, biological readouts in contact lenses and plants by Will and Lychee respectively.
Given Sam's great enthusiasm for space, we started exploring"
Lethbridge,2018,Team:Lethbridge#Demonstrate_-_-_TEXT.html,"el species, especially Zebra (D. polymorpha) and Quagga (D. bugensis) mussels, across aquatic environments in Canada represents serious ecological and economic hazard. Originating in Russia and the Ukraine, these mussel species spread rapidly through lakes and rivers to which they are introduced. They are responsible for injuries to swimmers, mass die-offs of native mollusk species, and hundreds of millions of dollars per year in damage to industries dependent on the Great Lakes (Rosaen et al. 2012). While Dreissena species have not yet invaded Alberta, the impact of a significant infestation would be felt across a wide range of industries.
One of the most promising new methods of controlling the spread of invasive mussels is Zequanox®, a cell lysate of Pseudomonas fluorescens. This treatment is believed to be effective due to FitD, a protein found in P. fluorescens that exhibits molluscicidal activity specifically against Dreissena species while sparing most indigenous mollusk species.
To demonstrate that PNCs enable a wide range of applications, including species-specific control of invasive organisms that pose an economic or environmental threat, we designed a PNC based system for delivering the protein toxin, FitD, to mussels. We chose to base our design on the bacteriophage P22 coat protein, as this PNC has well defined methods for encapsulating protein cargo and decorating the surface with functional peptides. See our Product Design page for more information
P22 PNCs as a Gene Therapy
One of the primary technical barriers to the application of CRISPR/Cas9-based genome editing is the delivery of DNA encoding all components of the system. Non-integrating viral vectors, like AAVs, are limited in the size of DNA constructs packaged and often have capacities below that required to encode all necessary regulatory sequences, proteins, and RNAs for CRISPR/Cas9 to function. Larger capacity viral vectors, like lentiviruses, insert their DNA cargo randomly in the genome and may produce dangerous mutations in transduced cells.
PNCs loaded with a Cas9-guide RNA complex represent a promising alternative to viral vectors for delivery of genome editing technologies for gene therapy and research applications. This need for simple and effective delivery of CRISPR/Cas9 systems was highlighted this year by the University of Calgary iGEM team. They focused on developing a novel approach to genome editing that combined the flexibility of the CRISPR/Cas9 system with the reliability of recombinases such as Cre and Flp.

Brochure Designing and Preaching
Our team of practice designed a brochure on knowledge about kidney disease carefully in order to                         make more patients with diabetes and hypertension recognize the dangers of the development of                         chronic kidney disease(CKD), and help the old to prevent CKD, hypertension and diabetes early.In                         July 2018, we held a knowledge preaching about the early prevention of CKD in Jianshan Community                         of Dalian ,and at the same time, we distributed our brochure designed by ourselves.In a summer                         house in the community, we distributed the brochure to some aunts,which lead them to understand                         the dangers of kidney disease, the causes of kidney disease, and methods for preventing early                         kidney disease. Besides, we answered many questions about diabetes and high blood pressure asked                         by those aunts patiently. After we had a further communication with community residents by                         interviewing them, we clearly felt that they had a deeper understanding of the dangers of CKD                         and the importance of its early prevention,which means our practice is successful enough.
Interviews with Doctors
During the summer vacation, the team members carried out practical activities throughout the                         country and went to the hospital to interview the specialists in the kidney department. We not                         only understand the serious situation that diabetes and hypertension cause the proportion of                         chronic kidney disease in China to rise year by year, but also know that patients with diabetes have no early and staged awareness. When patients come to the hospital for treatment, most of                         them have obvious symptoms and enter CKD phase III, and early visits and treatments are                         extremely important for the development of delayed kidney disease. At present, the diagnosis                         method of the hospital is mainly blood test, but the doctor said that if a non-invasive portable                         detection method through urine can be developed, it can not only alleviate the pain of blood                         drawing, but also have a very high rate of early detection and treatment. In this interview, we                         learned the importance and urgent needs of early detection in the treatment of chronic kidney                         disease and the importance of improving the awareness of early treatment of patients, and more                         deeply recognized the practicality and usefulness of our projects.
Product Research, Fun Marketing
In order to further understand the market demand for our products, the patient's recognition of                         products and their performance expectations for the products, we designed a questionnaire of the                         product. And to help people understand the superiority of our products, we have designed a                         product-based storyline, and we hope to attract more people who interest"

Collaborations
From the 25th to the 27th July 2014 three Swedish university iGEM teams (Linköping, Uppsala, and Chalmers) gathered at Linköping University for a joint Meet-Up which was initiated and planned by the LiU iGEM 2014 Team. The teams officially presented their projects for each other and participated in an Ethics and Collaboration Workshop. The workshop was divided into three parts:
A discussion about Collaboration and how the current Swedish iGEM Teams can jointly create a support network to aid in the establishment of new Swedish iGEM teams
A discussion about what direction the field of Synthetic Biology will take in the next 10 and 20 years, and how to foster an interest for Synthetic Biology amongst young people and the general public
A discussion about the more problematic sides of Synthetic Biology, namely accidental release into the environment, patenting of synthetic organisms, and how these issues should be approached.
The Meet-Up Weekend was deemed successful and all participating teams look forward to many years of future collaboration! The Ethics Discussion was summarized by LiU iGEM 2014 and is available to read in the PDF below.

What is iGEM?
iGEM stands for“International Genetically Engineered Machine.” The iGEM competition is an annual synthetic biology contest among undergraduates worldwide.  Each team must devise its own project and produce a new biological system, using a provided kit of biological parts and/or parts designed by the team. While all of the teams are competing, the true essence of the competition is to create new methods and systems to increase knowledge in the emerging field of synthetic biology.
The iGEM competition was started in 2004 and included 5 teams. Since then, more teams have joined every year to compete at the annual iGEM Jamboree held at MIT every November.  This year, the competition has grown to about 180 teams, and the Georgia Tech team is excited for becoming a competitor in this prestigious competition!

Project Description
In graph theory, the Single Pair Shortest Path Problem (SPP) is one of the basic problems with many applications. Many computational methodssuch as Dijkstra algorithm, A-star search algorithm and Floyd-Warshal algorithm etc., can solve it in a tolerable computational complexity. However, as the technology of the traditional silicon computers is gradually meeting its physical limits, new methods of the high-volume computing has been looked for for years.  As developing rapidly, synthetic biology makes bacterial computing possible and great potential. Programming Escherichia coli, the simplest model organism to implement these kinds of basic problems is very necessary. It will bring up with a brand new bio-computing method with better computational complexity.

Here, we will design a series of genetic circuits in Escherichia coli to solve the SPP in a directed graph. The nodes and arrows are programed as well-assigned promoters and transcription factors (TFs) respectively. For each arrow, the promoter of its source node initiates the expression of the TF which induces specifically the promoter of the target node. The paths in the graph are described by the transcriptional regulatory cascades. The promoter of destination node in SPP is followed by a green fluorescent protein (GFP) as a reporter. The temporal ordering of the fluorescent protein expression in E.coli reflects the distance difference among varied paths. According theoretical analysis, we can find the the shortest path consisted by all those arrows with linear computational complexity.

This idea, in the form of an advert for a fictitious healthcare company, raises several ethical questions regarding information security.
The team were also very active in educating the public via social media sites and in a radio interview, giving the public access to what happens inside the lab, shattering the intimidating ivory towers that kept the work of scientists of yesteryear isolated in the past. In addition to this, the team engaged in the public personally in both a large scale public workshop and by visiting various schools and educating the future of the UK population in the future of science and technology.
Not only that but the team also worked to bring together all 9 UK Collegiate iGEM teams (84 registered delegates, including several individuals not involved in iGEM) by hosting a 'hangout' at Google Campus for a day of inspiring presentations, which celebrate the innovative ideas that are emerging from these premier Synthetic Biology research groups. Our hangout were broadcasted publicly and globally through Google+ Events and Google Hangouts, all of which can now be viewed on youtube! The event was such a success Google got back to us and asked us whether the UK iGEM teams could meet again on their campus next year!

Finally, the team worked with BioLine to publish a blog entry and have arranged to take part in the SGM conference, which has worked to bring the world of synthetic biology to the attention of the wider scientific community.
This years team really have made efforts to inform the wider public of our projects aims, and synthetic biology in general, in an impartial and easy to understand way. Happily, several different media groups have contacted the team, and their project has already made the local news! It's onwards and upwards for the NRP-UEA iGEM team!

Though the down-regulation is not that evident, it still demonstrated that iRGD-KRAS-siRNA-exosomes can efficiently be delivered into tumor cells and regulate target gene expression, taking the short time of treatment into account.

Endotoxin is a type of natural pyrogen that was found in outer cell membrane of Gram-negative bacteria and can make impact on over 30 biological activities. To ensure the safety of our drug system, avoid toxicities, thus prove that our achievement is of great value for clinical application, a detecting assay was carried out using an endotoxin test kit. The result was negative, demonstrating that our drug system satisfies the safety requirement.

checkAn efficient drug delivery system
KRAS mutation was identified in NSCLC more than 20 years ago, but its clinical importance in cancer therapy just began to be appreciated. Our project aimed to develop a drug system that employed modified exosomes with iRGD peptide on its surface to deliver KRAS-siRNA into lung cancer cells specifically, thus target KRAS gene and down-regulate K-ras protein expression to treat lung cancer cases. Our results had demonstrated that iRGD-KRAS-siRNA-exosomes can be delivered into tumor cells and efficiently down-regulate KRAS expression both in vitro and in vivo. In silencing validation, we transfected KRAS siRNA into A549 cells using Lipo 2000 and performed western blot to test the function of our siRNA. Subsequently, we collected iRGD-modified exosomes loaded with KRAS siRNA, evaluating its effect on lung cancer cells (A549) by examining KRAS expression after transfection. The result confirmed that iRGD-KRAS-siRNA-exosomes could effectively down-regulate KRAS transcription level and reduce its protein expression. Later, the EDU assay further ascertained the biological role of KRAS siRNA in cell proliferation suppression in vitro.
To perform in vivo validation, none-small cell cancer mouse model was established after implanting tumor in 40 mice by subcutaneous injection with A549"

Extraction of Cry3Aa from B.thuringiensis
B. thuriengensis was grown for three days at 37⁰C in 5mL LB medium with sporulation salts (0.14 mM CaCl2, 0.20 mM MgCl2, 0.01 mM MnCl2). The proteins from the cell culture were extracted as written in the general protocol for protein extraction. However not the protein extract itself, but the pellet was further used. The pellet was dissolved in 6 mL carbonate buffer pH. The suspension was incubated for 2 hours at 37⁰C while shaking. The suspension was spun down. The Cry protein was expected to be in the supernatant.

Penn,2012,Team:Penn#Perceptions_-_-_TEXT.html," a therapeutic of choice could allow anyone interest to culture the organism themselves and have a potentially limitless supply of the drug. Simple PCR could allow direct access to the DNA ""source code"" for your own manipulations. This is much different than the current access to biologics or pharmaceuticals where only the final product, and not the means to produce for the product, is readily available. IP law will have to be very different to protect companies and provide incentives for the development of new biotechnologies while still promoting innovation and preventing the use of the patent system as a tool to monopolize and stifle competition.
Moral Issues
The use of bacterial-based therapeutics may open some moral discussion on humanity and augmentation. With standard drug-based therapies, the only way to make the effect of the drug ""permanent"" would be to constantly re-administer doses.  With bacteria therapeutics, it would be possible for the microbe to anchor in the body and produce a constant supply of a molecule.  The passiveness of the therapy may bring up discussion about augmentation.  By injecting these bacteria into the body, the person becomes better than they were previously, and this could theoretically be engineered to be permanent. Once this happens, you have changed the person, and philosophical discussions on the limits of man and the definition of human will most likely have to occur discussing the morals of altering the person. With socioeconomic factors in play, bacterial augmentations may widen the gap between the haves and have-nots.  While the possibility of this happening would be many years into the future, it is still something that should be kept in mind, especially when thinking about public perception of synthetic biology.
Solutions
The solutions to successfully integrate synthetic biology into society lie within the domains of regulation and control. Synthetic biology has the potential to do great good for humanity; it also has the potential to do great harm, whether intentionally or not. Therefore, measures must be put in place to ensure that the science is properly regulated and that synthetic organisms or systems are properly controlled.
To combat the issues of biosafety and biosecurity, controls need to be placed on the organisms themselves. ""Kill switches"" that cause the bacteria to die under anything other than ideal conditions are a popular method of controlling synthetically modified organisms. Modifying the lifespan of the bacteria finite will lower the risk of accidental contamination or genetic pollution. Additionally, regulation such as the FDA clinical trial process for drugs and biologics will need to be developed for engineered bacterial therapeutics. Scientists developing these treatments must be held to high standards, and should provide extensive research demonstrating not only that their microbe works, but"
Imperial_College_London,2011,Team:Imperial College London#Project#Switch#Overview_-_-_TEXT.html,"iholin and lysozyme will kill the cell, preventing it from keeping the plasmid containing the auxin genes. This mechanism will prevent the succesfull horizontal gene transfer to naturally occurring soil bacteria.
One flaw in the design, is that, due to the time constraints placed upon us by the iGEM competition, the system that we will engineer will have antibiotic resistance genes on the genome. This is not something that is intended as part of the overall design, but is necessary for this competition.
Modelling - Informing the Design
The key to the success of this design is the tight ratio between the amounts of holin and antiholin produced, and this needs to be carefully modelled before it can be assembled. The alternative method is to produce a promoter library using site-directed mutagenesis and then select for the survivors. This is, however, a time-consuming process and is extremely inefficient.

UPO-Sevilla,2011,Team:UPO-Sevilla#Human Practice#BSIES#IES Ostippo_-_-_TEXT.html,": If the advances of Science allow living to people with severe diseases, wouldn’t be that a way to direct the evolution of humanity?
Maybe, but this is what humanity have been doing during all the History. We take care of other human beings; we cannot think about the survival of the strongest when we talk about people.
María: Don’t you fear that by genetically modiying some organisms you may cause an irreversible damage to nature?
ynthetic biologists alter organisms, but they do it in a lab, a completely controlled place. Depending on the potential damage an organism could cause, labs must have different control mechanisms. If those genetically modified organisms are thought to work in an industrial or natural context then they must be designed for it. By now in Europe it is not possible to release genetically modified organisms in the nature, even to fight pollution, and scientists are studying the way to use them in our benefit without the release of new modified strains to the environment. On the other hand, most of the organisms we work with in the lab are engineered so that they would die quickly if accidentally released to the environment.
Antonio: Is it possible to patent a living organism? Is it allowed that a company patents a living organism or a molecule that could save the life to people (in this case, only the people who have enough money could have access to this resource)?
About patenting living organisms, it depends on the country. In the USA it is possible and the first organism patent was a Pseudomonas sp. strain designed to treat oil spills by General Electric in 1980. In Europe living organisms are not a patent matter and other places of the world have no clear rules about it.
About patenting molecules which could save the life of people, Pharmaceutical companies works on that. Their work is to develop new drugs, vaccines or other medicines which allow us to resist some diseases and finally prolong our life. As you said only people who can pay for it can use the patented medicine, but this also depend on the public health policy of the country.
Sergio Algarrada:  Medicine, Pharmaceutics, Biochemistry, Geology… all these disciplines have clear goals. What is the goal of Synthetic Biology?
Synthetic Biology is not a discipline of Science like those others. Actually it could be said that it is not a field of Science, it is a way to make Science. What defined SB are its characteristics: standardization, hierarchy, modeling, and quantitative measures; basically the same characteristics than define Engineering but applied to Biology. Another way to approach this issue is that the goal of Synthetic Biology is the same"

Additionally, the survey also told us how society perceives the problem we chose and if we would have to work to change their opinions on the importance of the problem.
There was a collaboration during the presentations in Chennai, the city in which the collaborating college, SVCE, is located. The point of the collaboration was that the iGEM projects of both the teams could be presented to the students and since our projects were quite different (ours was basic while theirs was applied research) and we could give the students exposure about the challenges in both these types of projects.
Govt. of Karnataka
Presentation to Government of Karnataka
We had a sit down on July 27th, 2016 with top officials at the Government of Karnatakaâs (GoK) (the state in which our institute is located) department of Information Technology, Biotechnology and Science and Technology and presented to them our idea and its applications.
We presented our project and its possible implementation in the government biotechnology parks which are lacking in machinery for automation and downstream processing, some of these processes can be performed by our BioBricks, which can effectively replace or supplement these expensive machines. Education of our governmental representatives is the quickest and surest way of ensuring change. Thus, the intent was to convince our government representatives of the need for enhancing the current government biotechnology facilities and a possible means of doing the same.
The novelty of using Ag43 for clarification of cell cultures and using this to replace or supplement energy and capital expensive centrifuges and its application in conjunction with auto-induction using quorum sensing made our idea patent worthy in their opinion and hence, to continue our research, the GoK's biotechnology department granted us ~$9,000 towards consumables for our project.

Description
We chose to base our work on a whole cell model originally developed by Tobias Bollenbach (2009), tailored to capture the influence of different antibiotics on the growth rate and metabolism of E.coli. This model was suitable because it is a simple high-level model, and it was possible to understand and re-implement it within the time course of one summer.  At the same time, it captures essential features of the cell metabolism which we might be interested in, such as resource availability, growth rate, and intracellular protein levels.
The model in the original paper assumes a constant influx of resources from the outer environment inside the cell. All resources needed to the cell are combined into one generic resource called A. This influx of A to the cell is the only input to the model, and as a function of it, the model can predict population average values for the following parameters (Figure 1):
Growth rate
Resource concentration inside the cell
Protein number
Amount of DNA
Number of ribosomes
Speeds of synthesis of proteins, ribosomes and DNA
The cell volume
Number of replication origins and forks in the cell
Figure 1. Simple diagram of the variables and relationships captured by the Bollenbach model
The model does not model RNA specifically, nor does it take into account the different proteins, their different expression levels and their different functions. Additionally, the model does not model degradation of proteins, only degradation of resources (which is supposed to capture resource usage by other factors which are not accounted for by the model).
The model constitutes a differential-algebraic system of equations, which track the evolution of the parameters over time.  There are 4 differentiation equations and 11 algebraic equations, which respectively relate the instantaneous amount of resources, protein, ribosome and DNA to their synthetic rate, and describe the interactions (protein and ribosome synthesis, DNA replication etc.) in the cell at molecular level. Another equation is introduced to enable the system to achieve steady states, implicitly relating growth rate to protein synthesis rate. The predictions given by the model are found by finding the steady-state solution of the differential"

Biosensor design
    Our biosensors using as chassis Escherichia coli K12 and Lactobacillus lactis Nis+ are based on two modules, which show differences to the works previously reported (Hwan et al., 2013; Saeidi et al., 2011).  The first module has the genetic elements for the production of the protein LasR. This biomolecule is the sensor protein which binds to the homoserine lactone and activates the second module. This module has two devices, the alginate lyase gene and an antimicrobial peptide microcin or nisin.The use of microcin or lisin depends on whether E. coli or L. lactis are used as chassis, respectively (Figures 1 and  2, section PROJECT->DESIGN). The alginate lyase will destroy the Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilm mainly made of alginate, and the bacteriocins or antimicrobial peptides will kill the pathogenic bacteria (Tielen et al., 2013; Saeidi et al., 2011). We selected the microcin gene to be expressed in E. coli, as this bacteriocin is produced by a probiotic E. coli G3/10 (Zschüttig et al., 2012) and also because it was available in the Registry of Standard Biological Parts  (Bba_K565004). In addition, although nisin, a bacteriocin produced by L. lactis has been reported in some studies that does not have effect on Gram negative bacteria, e.g. P. aeruginosa, Giacommetti et al. (1996) found that a high concentration of this antimicrobial, has an effect on P. aeruginosa viability. We decided to test the possibility that increasing the concentration of nisin in L. lactis Nis+, might have an effect on P. aeruginosa. It is important to indicate that although we might have positive results, the use of nisin in a biopatch"

Because of the DNA-protein complex, the effective replication rate of plasmid is
Numerical simulation
According to the previous analysis, the parameters which we can manipulate in the experiment is protein binding affinity(by choosing different binding sites) and protein degradation rate(by adding degradation tag). Here is the simulation results with a parameter of k and kdp
Parameter dependency
final product plasmid_protein complex we got by using different protein_binding sites and protein degradation rates:
We can see that higher binding affinity favors the final production of plasmid vectors(plasmid-protein complex). And the influence of protein degration rate is a little ambiguous: fast degradation may either favor or adverse to the production of plasmid vectors (compare when k= 0.021/1.626 and 0.021/5.197)according to the protein binding affinity. After all, both of the influence of protein binding affinity and protein degradation rate is minor and the binding of protein doesn't change the nature replication process much.
Conclusions
According to the analysis in the modeling section, we find that different parameters such as protein binding affinity and protein degradation rate won't affect the amount of the target protein significantly in the range of experimental values. However, it does give us the clue that protein with higher affinity and moderate degradation rate is suitable for large scale industry production.
Molecular Docking for Targeted Biobrick
Integrin structure
Fiber structure
We used ZDOCK software to conduct the molecular docking day experiment. In the generated docking graph, the ligand (we used the crystalized fiber protein to substitute the targeted biobrick) and the receptor (integrin) are both in a stretched confirmation in which the spacial clash is relatively small. Moreover, in the fiber confirmation, the positions for both RGD domain and cell-specific peptide are exposed to the surface to faciliate the specific interaction with the cell specific receptor and integrin.

Our device is not only environmental friendly, but also a reusable one. After the flushing of a lysis buffer, most cells can be washed away, even those attached to walls. Then the device will be washed for three times by sterilized water before reuse.

Image Capturing & Data analysis
The green fluorescence of bacteria in chambers is captured every 5 minutes by an inverted microscope (Eclipse Ti, Nikon) with a standard CCD camera manually and usually last more than 7 hrs. (This is really a big challenge for our team and very physically demanding since this is the only available fluorescence we could find. However, we managed to finish this data collecting process anyway. Good jobs, guys！)
Data are transferred into oscillation curves by ImageJ and software designed by our teammate for digital image batch processing. (More detail for our self-designed software, please refer to protocol.)

Modeling
Mathematical model
We modeled the oscillate gene circuit (without ndh gene) based on the paper ""A synchronized quorum of genetic clocks""[12]. In that, the author characterized the oscillator by using the four delay differential equations (DDEs), which are the basic of our modeling. DDE can perfectly simulate our circuit due to its powerful function about solving the dynamic change in biological processes.
In the first two equations,
item is a Hill function equaling to
, which describes the delayed reactions about the complex processes in the cells (transcription, translation, maturation, etc.). This Hill function takes the history of the system into account, i.e. the concentration of AHL at the time it binds to LuxR to form the activation complex.
This model does not include an equation for LuxR assuming that it is constitutively produced at a constant level. All parameters are normalized for the convenience of analysis.
Modeling in MATLAB

Fig. 3-3-3-11. Overview of the fim related parts in iGEM.
The characteristic of the part ( BBa_K1077002 ) ) constructed by Michigan, is that it can be inverted in [ON] state to [OFF] state direction or in [OFF] state to [ON] state done-sidedly with induction of aTc or AHL. The repression of the tet promoter by the tet repressor is weakened by the addition of aTc. Therefore, fimE ( BBa_K137007 ) ), which is on the downstream of the tet promoter is expressed by inducing aTc. As a result, the fim switch is inverted from [ON] state to [OFF] state. In other words, the target gene which is on the downstream of the fim switch, is not expressed.
On the other hand, by the addition of AHL, lux promoter is activated. Therefore, hbiF ( BBa_K880000 ) ), which is on the downstream of the lux promoter, is expressed. HbiF inverts the fim switch in [OFF] state to [ON] state. As a result, the target gene which is on the downstream of the fim switch, is expressed.
There are two immense issues to their system, judging from their experimental results. First of all, we could not conclude that their fim switch and fimE is functioning correctly, because the results were only shown for the fim switch[default ON] in their wiki and parts registry. In other words, the data of fim switch[default OFF] was not shown. Without the data of fim switch[default OFF], we can’t conclude that FimE ( BBa_K137007 ) ) inverts the fim switch in [ON] state to [OFF] state predominantly.
Second of all, the results of Team Michigan, lack reproducibility because they have failed to set Positive controls and Negative controls in all of their experiments.
It was impossible to verify the reproducibility because the nucleotide sequence of this part ( BBa_K1077002 ) ) was completely different between the distribution from the HQ and the information shown on the parts registry.

TU_Delft-Leiden,2014,Team:TU Delft-Leiden#Human Practices#Appendix_-_-_TEXT.html," environmental issues. “We have customers from all over the world. We are currently working on a project in Vietnam to detect dioxins. The concentration of these compounds in Vietnam is far above the health limits as a result of spraying with dioxin-contaminated defoliants.”
Upon being asked about innovations in BDS, Van Der Burg tells us: “We are currently mainly focused on optimizing our CALUX system. We simplify and automate the process of doing assays using our CALUX cells. Although we do not really focus on the detection of novel compounds with new pathways, we are currently trying developing a dioxin sensor for our project in Vietnam. We do this by searching for dioxin receptors which might have arisen in species living in contaminated areas.” However, this is not their usual approach in developing new sensor systems, which consist of extensive literature study and making use of toxicological research.
When we came to discussing ELECTRACE, Van Der Burg reacted very enthusiastic. “Alternative read-outs are very interesting. For light and fluorescence assays you need lots of equipment and devious procedures. For us, this is not really a problem since we do our measurements in the lab, but for a device like yours, which is to be applied in the field, is a really ‘nice trick’.” Also, our plan to create single-use, disposable paper microfluidics strips fascinated him: “That is very interesting; a disposable device is really the thing you need. What would make it even better is if you don’t have to cultivate your bacteria anymore. These costs a lot of time, and maybe even more important, a lot of money.” We further discussed possible (commercial) application of our ELECTRACE system. “Even when a handheld device shows to be unfeasible, there is a lot of potential for you to develop your project in a kit-like setting. This is much easier to sell than a license!”
We told Van Der Burg that we had some concerns about the speed of our system. He told us not to worry about that too much: “Our systems have a response time between 4 and 24 hours. If you really want a fast reaction you should use the translocation of tagged proteins, but this is at the expense of your accuracy.” Furthermore, he gave us some valuable advice: “The specialty of BDS is the measurement of complex mixtures, which is really important for real world applications. If your reporter responds to TNT in a distilled water solution, that is nice, but you should try if it is also possible to sense it in the kind of sample that you will use. In your case"

Regardless of the topic, iGEM projects often create or adapt computational tools to move the project forward. Because they are born out of a direct practical need, these software tools (or new computational methods) can be surprisingly useful for other teams. Without necessarily being big or complex, they can make the crucial difference to a project's success. This award tries to find and honor such ""nuggets"" of computational work.
