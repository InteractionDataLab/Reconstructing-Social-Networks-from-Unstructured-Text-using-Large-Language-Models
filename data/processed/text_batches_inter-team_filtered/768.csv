o Centrifugate the columns for additional 1 min to remove residual Wash Soulution.  This step is essential to avoid residual ethanol in plasmid preps.
o Transfer the GeneJET spin column should into a fresh 1,5 ml microcentrifuge tube.  Add 50 µL of the Elution Buffer to the center of GeneJET spin column membrane to  elute the plasmid DNA. The membrane must not be contacted with the pipette tip.  Incubated for 2 minutes at room temperature and centrifugate for 2 minutes.  Repeat.
o Discard the column and store the purified plasmid DNA at -20°C.
Making Gel for gel electrophoresis
o Choose the concentration of gel you want to use (e.g. 0.7%, 1%, 2%...)
o Measure out the relevant percentage of agarose powder (e.g. 2g of agarose for  100ml of 2% gel).
o Add the relevant volume of 1xTAE buffer (e.g. 100ml of 1xTAE for 2g of agarose for  2% gel)
o Microwave on low for 1-3 minutes, constantly taking it out every so often to swirl  and mix it. Keep microwaving until clear. Make sure it is completely clear.
o Cool to a temperature that is still hot but still can be held in your hand. If the gel gets  too cold and starts to harden, start microwaving again until clear.
o Add 3µl of ethidium bromide for every 100ml of gel after cooled to the correct  temperature. Mix it well by swirling.
o Pour it onto the gel tray with the combs in place.
o Wait 20-30 minutes until the gel completely solidifies.
o Place the agarose gel into electrophoresis unit.
o Add loading buffer to each of your samples.
o Fill the electophoresis unit with 1xTAE until the gel is completely covered.
o Load 7 µl of molecular weight ladder into the first well and load your samples in  additional wells.
o Run the gel at 90V-120V and 400 mA until the dye line is half the way down the gel  (30-45 minutes).
o View the gel in a device with UV light.

Cardiff_Wales,2016,Team:Cardiff Wales#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," coli 16S rRNA locus.
Dr. Daniel Pass developed a program to assist in designing sgRNA constructs for non-standard genomic regions and species, to the specifications required for this system. Here, we targeted the  E. coli 16S rRNA locus in order to facilitate proof-of-concept testing of our in vitro system. The design of these constructs was achieved using a Python script developed to find appropriate paired regions from a FASTA formatted genomic DNA region for paired target sequences using  guidelines  from Takara Bio USA alongside additional sources.The script initially identifies proto-spacer adjacent motif (PAM) sequences (5'-NGG-3') in this FASTA sequence in forward and reverse. The sgRNA sequence is complementary to the 20 nucleotides upstream of the PAM sequence, after accounting for other enhancement features. Viable pairs within a defined range of each other are selected and passed to BLASTn to test for simple alignment against a reference dataset. This would include the remainder of the species genome, and also multiple cross-reactive species. The output is a FASTA file of potential probe pairs, a table.txt file of the same information in a graphical representation, and the results of the blast search, to aid in choosing probes which do not demonstrate cross-reactivity
We designed one forward (F1) and three reverse (R1, R2 and R3) sgRNA constructs targeted to the E. Coli 16S rRNA locus using this program. Differing coexpression conditions could thus facilitate the characterization of background reconstitution at differing genomic distances. This builds on similar experimentation by MIT in 2013, and could contribute to future work with similar split reporter systems. This locus was selected due to its high copy number, promoting a strong signal during initial testing.

 First, we measured the fluorescence intensity from the GFP expression in the presence of arabinose. From the results (Fig. 3-3-2-6.), we confirmed that the fim switch (wild-type) is inverted from both [ON] state to [OFF] state and [OFF] state to [ON] state.
 Next, in order to confirm inversion more precisely, we also show the percentage of ON state (Fig. 3-3-2-7) and inversion in the level of DNA sequencing (Fig. 3-3-2-8).  Fig.3-3-2-7 and Fig.3-3-2-8 clearly shows inversion from both [ON] state to [OFF] state and [OFF] state to [ON] state. E. coli harboring the [ON] fim switch plasmid glows in green fluorescence while E. coli harboring the [OFF] fim switch plasmid does not glow under ultra violet light.  Cells transformed by the plasmid mixture extracted from the experiment formed two types of colonies: those with strong fluorescence and those with little background fluorescence.
 Also, sequence complementarity in the specific region of the fim switch(wild-type) shows intended inversion of the fim switch from [ON] state to [OFF] state.  Furthermore, the nearly equal number of the colonies between fluorescent and non-fluorescent suggest random inversion of the fim switch by FimB expression.

Lambert_GA,2017,Team:Lambert GA#Description_-_-_TEXT.html,"2017 Lambert iGEM team aimed to develop an imaging device called the Chrome-Q to cost-effectively standardize conditions for quantifying chromoprotein data; additionally, the team improved upon the 3-D-fuge originally designed by the Prakash Lab to pellet cells at a low cost. Different chromoproteins - Tinsel Purple, Virginia Violet, and Scrooge Orange - were induced at varying levels of IPTG, causing the cells to express different intensities; pictures of the cells were taken using a Chrome-Q and were measured with a self-constructed software app that analyzes the pigments using HSV color space. Additionally, the team observed that a common issue encountered by synthetic biologists is the overlap of protein expression in the development of genetic circuits which negatively affects the quality of performance in a given cell. The 2017 Lambert iGEM Team worked to develop an inducible “switch” to further characterize ClpXP, a non-lysosomal proteolysis mechanism, with three Keio strains; the data showed a correlation between IPTG concentration and amount of protein degradation. Overall, Lambert iGEM desired to promote scientific research under any financial circumstance and to characterize non-lysosomal inducible protein degradation (CLiP’d).

Vilnius-Lithuania,2018,Team:Vilnius-Lithuania#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," our former PI. Professor had presented the latest technology and innovations in the field of life sciences and pointed their impact on our everyday life. Relating this lecture to the purpose of the celebration, he introduced not only traditional DNA, but also XNA (synthetic, Xeno DNA) and its possible future applications.
The final part of DNA Day’s celebration was a coaching-type discussion about the provisional steps in turning our dreams into ideas and those ideas into real world applications. We invited some of the Vilnius-Lithuania iGEM 2018 stakeholders and partners to initiate a dialogue between them, the representatives of our team, and the community of Life Sciences Center. During the discussion, possibilities and most common difficulties which young scientists face while trying to implement their ideas in a university or by launching startups were covered. Considering that more and more teams set up their own companies after iGEM, we suggested an idea of developing our project into a possible startup. We learned that stakeholders were impressed by our project, however some concerns regarding complexity and time consumption were put into light. During the discussion an idea was suggested for us to develop a software which would ease the implementation of our project goals and would also be useful for other scientists in the field.
To sum up, celebration of the DNA Day allowed schoolchildren to take a glance at the project we have created for this year’s competition. It was a pleasure to see how enthusiastically pupils enjoyed the orienteering competition and how inspired they were after understanding our projects’ aim and significance. Even though it was kind of an entertainment for schoolchildren, we also felt encouraged to consider our project in all its bearings and find more creative ways to improve it. In addition Vilnius-Lithuania team members had a great opportunity to take a different look at the subjects they studied and pass their knowledge to the new generation. The discussion not only gave us information about startup-possibilities, but also inspired us to consider setting up one ourselves - we became sure about the necessity of our project and gained insights on how we could improve it.
Finally, we hope that the DNA Day’s celebration will become a pleasant yearly tradition in Vilnius University Life Sciences Center.

Discussions with the stakeholders we had during the DNA Day celebration was a great inspiration to search for a creative approach to implement our idea and to make this year’s project more public-friendly. Representing various professional-fields, the participants of the discussion proved us that a multidisciplinary team nowadays is a key to success. This is why we decided to organize an event for people who face"

However, for the purpose of our further work, we used the Etaluma Lumascope S40 fluorescence microscope, which had an LED light source, with the appropriate excitation, emission and dichroic filters for observing our GFP levels. Loaded in the channel, our cells showed fluorescence, and a sample image is shown below –

In order to visualize the oscillations, we needed to maintain a flow rate in the system. This is because as cells would grow, they would produce toxic compounds inside the chamber, and also reach stationary phase, which would cause a slowdown in protein production, which could kill the oscillations. Flow rate maintenance is something that commonly needs to be done in microfluidic chambers where oscillations are required to be seen, but such sophisticated systems for flow rate maintenance are extremely costly and require specialized equipment to handle.
We designed our own cost effective solution to the problem, by using commonly available material. From the required velocity of the fresh medium that would be needed, the flow rate was calculated. This was in turn used to calculate the pressure difference using the Hagen Poiseuille law. This pressure difference that would be required for the system was achieved by filling media inside a rubber pipe of small diameter (0.4 mm), and placing it up to a height h such that the hydrostatic pressure would be equal to the pressure difference required.
The height could be modulated to generate different flow rates and tune them specifically for our requirements. The following videos show the different flow rates that could be achieved –
Low Flow Rate –
Intermediate Flow Rate –
High Flow Rate –
Further, the droplets that were generated could also be modified to allow cells to pass through or not, depending on the initial pressure and volume of air that was pumped into the system. The following video shows how when low amounts of air is pushed through, the cells are able to pass through from droplet to droplet, from the edges of the air bubbles.

USMA-West_Point,2018,Team:USMA-West Point#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," independently probe the intended submission plasmid, restriction digest reactions were performed. The sequence information provided for the bio-brick insert showed that it contained two KpnI sites, whereas the iGEM pSB1C3 plasmid lacks a KpnI site (Figure 2A). If the bio-brick insert was present, then products of ~3.7 and 0.3kb were expected (Figure 2A). By contrast, two bands were observed at ~2500 and ~1500bp (Figure 2C). The second digest used EcoRI and MscI enzymes. This digest was expected to generate products 2.7, 0.7 and 0.6kb (Figure 2B). By contrast, we only observed bands at just below 1500bp and at ~700bp (Figure 2C). We believe that the ~700bp band corresponds fragment generated by the MscI and EcoRI sites present in the pSB1C3 backbone. The possibility that this apparent single band is actually the anticipated 0.6kb band unresolved from the 0.7kb band is unlikely because, as the ladder shows, products of those sizes are well resolved on this gel (restriction digest reactions were analyzed on an 0.8% agarose gel in 1XTAE for approximately 40min at 100V).
Figure 2
Due to the inconsistencies in the PCR product sizes between the reactions with the control (pYTK) and iGEM (pSB1C3) plasmids, in addition to the discrepancies in the expected and observed restriction digest products, we cannot conclude that iGEM submission plasmid is constructed as intended.

SCUT-China_A,2017,Team:SCUT-China A#Project Design_-_-_TEXT.html," result                     in clear phenomenon. What's more, we can he calculate the amount of enzyme relatively accurately by measuring                     the consumption of the substrate or the production of the product.
         We found that endogenous enzyme β-galactosidase from the E. coli, which is able to act as the ""chemical signal                     factor"" in our chromogenic module. It can catalyze colorless substrate such as x-gal or oNPG and produce                     blue or yellow products. The results indicated that with the IPTG induction, the gray value of the result                     of chromogenic reaction present an obvious law which can be used in quantitative measurement.
Detecting module
        As the pollution of heavy metal is serious, and the current detection methods are complex and expensive,                     we try using our repot module to detect heavy metal ions. In order to specifically detect heavy metal                     ions, we refer to mechanisms and genes related to bacteria's metal tolerance, from which we find promotors                     and regulatory factors can specifically respond to heavy metal ions. We selected five operons that are able to respectively respond to Hg 2+ , Pb 2+ , Cd 2+, Ni 2+, Cr 6+. And we finally develop three sensitive and specific metal ion detecting module (mercury                         detecting device( BBa_K2360008 ), cadmium detecting device( BBa_K2360010 ) and lead detecting device( BBa_K2360011 )).
Integrated Project
        Based on the results of the previous researches, we are going to synthesize five kinds of operons which can                     specifically respond to certain heavy metal ions and place them on the upstream of the SRRz lysis gene.
         At first, the bacteria would stably express the β-galactosidase. Once the bacteria accept a ""signal""                     —— specific heavy metal ions, it would express the lysis gene rapidly so that the bacteria would be lysed.                     Therefore, the β-galactosidase could be released into the solution with substrate and lead to chromogenic                     reaction.
        The depth of the color（which is reflected as its gray value） produced by the chromogenic reaction is                     positively correlated to the lysis rate of the cells, and the lysis rate of the cells is positively correlated                     to the intensity of the SRRz, which is induced by its operon, and finally determined by the intensity                     of the heavy metal ions. This result made it able to be used for not only qualitative detection but also                     quantitative measurement.

ETH_Zurich,2017,Team:ETH Zurich#Future Perspectives_-_-_TEXT.html," triggering the thermal switch that lyses the cells and releases the cancer-toxin. Popular FUS transducers (like from Sonic Concepts Co.) cost around $4500 and could be used with front-end sensing solutions such as from Texas Instruments (for eg. TDC 1000), that would overall be much cheaper than an MRIgFUS.
Moreover, according to recent developments in MRI science [4] , [5] , the near-future will very likely see cheaper and better accessible MRIgFUS devices. Recent research for gadolinium replacement for MRI [6] will also possibly lead to cheaper MRI solutions in the future, and thus could potentially lead to more economically-feasible MRIgFUS technology.
As per Beat Werner, radio frequency (RF) is better than FUS for heating a larger volume and thus a better solution for us, to heat the whole bacteria layer while maintaining a temperature of 45°C for 3 hours to trigger expression of protein E. However, currently RF allows lesser control than FUS. But with rapid progress in this field, using sound/RF as a non-invasive tool used in medicine would become better, cheaper and more accessible with time.

Goal: To  test the fluorescence intensity of PBAD-RLT beads.
Transferred  the PBAD-RLT  beads into  20mL LB medium with Ampicillin, 37°C shaker  ( 50r/min)incubated.
After 2  hours, added 2mL Ara. Took 5 PBAD-RLT beads and rinsed them  with PBS, then Started  fluorescence test  (exciting laser intensity: 485 nm, emitting laser intensity: 520 nm). Tested on  0.5h, 1h, 1.5h, 4h, 5h, 6h.
Problem:  There was a little difficulty taking out the beads without breaking them,  therefore the time we need to collect sample was prolonged.
When  first taken out, PBAD-RLT  beads emitted very low fluorescence.  After a while in plates, the fluorescence became stronger.
Maybe  the GFP proteins inside the bead emit fluorescence only after they are exposed  to enough oxygen. When the beads are in the medium, the dissolved oxygen is  relatively insufficient due to the low rotating speed.

UC_Davis,2016,Team:UC Davis#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," implementation of a Gel Electrophoresis on these samples. All other reagent concentrations remained unchanged from the prior experimentation.
7/15-Brent
Made colonies of Bacillus subtillus by placing stock colonies on LB media and glycerol stock-- allowing them to grow for multiple days. Prepared PCY79, Spo0A3, and KO7 Bacillus strains for the UC Santa Cruz iGEM team to use. These strains were propagated and distributed to the UCSC iGEM team. We asked Dr. Daniel Zeigler for permission to distribute these strains and obtained written permission for this distribution on July 14th. Competence Preparation and Transformation protocols for Bacillus subtilis was also shared with the UCSC iGEM team as part of our collaboration.
A Cryofreeze Procedure was implemented as follows:
A single colony from Bacilus subtilis was isolated from each strain type: Spo0A3, PCY79, and KO7.
Single colonies were placed into a 3 ml LB media solution with no antibiotics within a test tube. This culture was grown up at 37 deg. C. at approximately 180 rpm, in a MaxQ 8000 thermal cycler.
A control was prepared with LB media only (no bacteria)
Each culture was grown up until the LB media appeared to be sufficiently cloudy.
Cryofreeze tubes were obtained from each culture, ensuring 2 ml total of LB-Bacillus culture and Glycerol combined made it into each Cryofreeze tube. 312.5 microliters of 80% glycerol stock was combined with 1,687.5 microliters of LB-Bacillus culture such that glycerol would comprise 12.5% of the final 2 ml solution.

Final Concensus:"
Bielefeld-CeBiTec,2017,Team:Bielefeld-CeBiTec#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," was great to meet people from all over Europe and especially our friends from Munich and the Team Unifi with whom we started the mentoring partnership. After the official end of the meet-up, we met with some members of the team Cologne Duesseldorf and had a wonderful afternoon at the seaside.
Figure 7: Six of our team members at the European meet-up in delft.
Postcards
Just like last year, the team Cologne Duesseldorf organized a campaign to promote synthetic biology by inviting other iGEM teams to design interesting postcards related to synthetic biology. We were thrilled by this idea and started with the design of our own postcard. Since we were then in a time of intense cloning which consumed a huge amount of agarose gels, we decided to collect the nicest and most terrible gel pictures of our current work. We liked the funny design of the final card, and this little distraction motivated us to work even harder.

Labnotes Creator
To make it easier for this years and future iGEM teams to write and upload their lab journals to the wiki, we developed the Labnotes Creator . After initial testing performed by our team, we reached out to other iGEM teams to test the software. We would like to thank our beta testers team TU Darmstadt and team Duesseldorf-Cologne . Team Duesseldorf-Cologne provided some valuable feedback, while team TU Darmstadt actively tested and validated our software. A big thank you to both team!"

d-AuNPs Testing: ssDNAp interaction with EPO target DNA
The prescreening with d-AuNPs is tested with EPO DNA as target. Prior, the ssDNAp is heated up to let the ssDNAp anneal to EPO target DNA and create the secondary structure. The ssDNAp, EPO target DNA and hybridization buffer were incubated:
5 minutes at 95 ºC (denature dsDNA target)
1 minute at 57 ºC (anneal ssDNAp to dsDNA target)
10 minutes at 21 ºC
20 µL d-AuNPs, 10 µL target dsDNA, 6 µL hybridization buffer, 4 µL ssDNAp 1 and 20 µL of a varying salt concentration (range of 0 mM to 1000 mM) were added to the 96 wells plate. The plate was incubated at 21 ºC during 10 minutes. The visible absorption spectrum from 450 nm to 650 nm of the solutions was measure and the ratio 620/520 nm was calculated for analysis. The experiment was performed in triplicate. The plate view, relevant absorption spectra and ratio 620/520 nm is shown.
The aggregation of d-AuNPs due to increasing salt concentration starts at 500 mM of NaCl. When a ssDNAp is added, the aggregation is extended to a NaCl concentration of 600 mM. However, presence of dsDNA target with a ssDNAp that can specifically bind to the target dsDNA does not influence the aggregation behavior drastically compared"

Utah State University
Nestled in Cache Valley in northern Utah, Utah State University is sometimes overlooked as a quality college. Despite humble beginnings as a land-grant Agricultural School in 1888, USU has propelled itself into national status on the academic and athletic level. It was recently heralded as the #1 highest-ranked public university in the West and #4 in the nation for lowest tuition in ""America's Top Colleges"" (Forbes, ""America's Best College Buys,"" Aug. 2011). Engineering programs at USU consistently bring in laurels from national and international competitions.

The sgRNA (T7) is highly expressed, inhibiting the expression of mRFP1 and sgRNA(J23). The inhibition stage of GFP is ‘withdrawn’. At this stage, the system shows high GFP level and low mPFP1 level.
The bistable switch is designed as a minimal circuit to demonstrate the feasibility to build a whole CRISProgrammer system, which enables orthogonal regulation and demonstrate the regulation process of indigo syntesis.

Reporter
The Reporter Module contains two fluorescence proteins as its reporters (Figure 3). The construction of Reporter module involves two steps. First, rrnB T1 terminator and T7te terminator (BBa_B0010, BBa_B0012) were added behind the mRFP1 coding sequence. Our team is afraid that without the terminator in the transcriptional unit of mRFP1, the elongation will process, and the GFP will expression simultaneously. All the basic parts come from the previous exist plasmids in the
registry (BBa_K199118). Then, 3A assembly method was used to build the functional reporter by inserting T7-RFP fragment into J23100-GFP-pSB1C3 backbone. The experiment details are shown in the notebook .
We have successfully constructed the reporter plasmid and verified that it could function well (T7 promoter-RFP-J23100-GFP):
T7 promoter-RFP-J23100-GFP-pSB1C3 has been successfully constructed. The normal function of the GFP and mRFP1 have been verified.
dCas9 Expression Validation
We obtained the plasmid p-GFP-dCas9-VVD from Haiyan Liu's lab, University of Science and technology of China, and are to modify the plasmid so it could be of our use. First, we have to remove the trailing VVD sequence in frame with the dCas9 ORF and add a 6x His-Tag to dCas9 for downstream detection; second, we choose to delete the GFP coding sequence for we want a solely dCas9-expressing plasmid. What’s more, we decided to keep the backbone for it carried rop sequence, which makes it low-copy and therefore thought to be exerting less effect on the E. coli viability. After adding 6x His-Tag, we would transform the plasmid into DH5α and do Western Blot to verify the expression of dCas9.

Today we made sterile LB and some new agar plates (5 with amp, 1 without + some extra plates that should have had amp but didn't.) Ampicillin was added at a ration of 1 uL per mL of agar liquid.
We autoclaved some waste and some pipette tips.
We received competent cells from fredsense to use for a transformation with our NDC 001-1 in the PET21a plasmid.
We had an issue with rehydrating the DNA. We added 15 uL of distilled water to 4 ug of plasmid, but after centrifuging and stirring it seemed like there was very little DNA solution, so we added an additional 10 uL of water before proceeding with the transformation. We let this sit for 7 minutes before moving forward with the transformation.
Because of needing to rehydrate the DNA with additional water, the competent cells were thawed on ice, distributed into tubes, and then put back on ice before the DNA was added.
We followed the transformation procedure from the Synthetic Biology Workshop Protocol Manual (University of Lethbridge 2016).

Collaboration with Aalto-Helsinki
We collaborated with Aalto_helsinki team as well. We contacted them because they were working  on a similar project we were working on: producing boifuel with the tools of synthetic biology. While  they focused on producing propanol, we focused on producing butanol.
We kept in touch regularly trought e-mail, but also held a skype conference, where we talked about  our projects and the ways we could help each other. We both ordered gene fragments from IDT and  talked about that expreience and we gave each other tips on how to best accomplish other tasks of  iGEM. At the time, Slovenia HS has already done some work on our Human Practices, such as  presentations for students and appearences in media, while Aalto-Helsinki was just starting to  prepare their Human Practices, so we talked and echanged information and ideas about that. On teh  other hand, aalto-Helsinki already had experience creating wiki pages (their team won the award for  best wiki in 2014), while Slovenia HS was beginning to learn, so we were glad to also be able to ask  some questions about creating wiki.
We did some work for them in the laboratory as well. Aalto-Helsinki sent us one of their BioBricks (BBa_K1655001) for validation and to be able to compare their results with ours.  This BioBrick is a GFP that can be fused into any protein's aminoterminal. We first attempted to  validate this brick by fusing it with one of our genes (CtfB) that was already tested and proved to be  functional and active.
Our construct with CtfB and double terminator (K1669005) was first ligated as a back insert into their  plasmid pSB1C3 with GFP (BBa_K1655001) .

Fig 1. Relative Strength for the five repressible promoters, including the novel promoters pPhlF and pSrpR, used in the construction and analysis of 5n1. The decreasing order of relative strength is pLac>pcI>pPhlF>pTet>pSrpR. Rlative strengths have been averaged over 4 trials.

Fig 6. OD over time for the five repressible promoters, including the novel promoters pPhlF and pSrpR, used in the construction and analysis of 5n1. The plots have been averaged over 4 trials.
As shown in Fig. 2, pLac and pcI have three distinct regions of behavior in terms of relative strength over time. In the initial transient phase, dilution rate is higher than the protein production rate, thus we see that relative strength per OD decreases over time. The middle corresponds to overcompensation phase, where protein production rate surpasses the dilution rate. Finally, the relative strength settles a steady state value, entering an exact compensation between protein production and dilution rates. Contrary to pLac and pcI, the other promoters don’t exhibit the overcompensation phase.

Cambridge,2009,Team:Cambridge#Notebook#Week6_-_-_TEXT.html," Alan!) very kindly miniprepped all the activator constructs again so we can continue to consume the DNA at a shocking pace.
MelA BioBrick
Started the protocol to remove restriction sites. PCR with primers A/B worked, however, no results were present for PCR with primers C/F. As  both A, F and the enzyme have been shown to work, it was decided that this was probably an issue with Primer C. It was decided to move on and attempt to remove the second resitriction site, using primers A/D and E/F.
The same Finnzymes reaction mixture was used, along with the Touchdown PCR procedure. Both sets of primers worked! The gel was put in the fridge for DNA extraction and the continuation of the MelA BioBrick formation tomorrow.
From left to right the bands show: 2-log ladder, reaction mix with primers A and D and DMSO added, reaction mix with primers A and D and no DMSO, resction mix with primers E and F with no DMSO. The second and fourth lanes had the DNA at the correct length for the fragments we were expecting, and so these were used for DNA extraction.

High School Tours in Tianjin
Responsibility comes with the ability. As main iGEM teams in Tianjin, we are entrusted with the duty of spreading our concept and advanced knowledge.
With the same wish, we easily reached a consensus with NKU-China  and TUST-China . We held several meetups to discuss the appropriate approach to advocating rational analysis and creative thoughts during the CCiC. Eventually, we decided to take the first step in high schools.
We firstly listened to experts in education and contacted several high school in Tianjin. Teachers warmly welcome us to display and explain experiments for students. We hit it off with each other immediately. All three teams cooperated tightly, presenting a wonderful schedule containing: the concept of synthetic biology and its influence in reality, introduction of classic iGEM projects and example of our program, non-toxic yeasts which showed different beautiful colors.
To our great surprise, we received countless fans of synthetic biology and they showed great passion about the amazing field. They listened carefully and asked questions actively. The energetic and creative thoughts provided us valuable inspiration about our program. It was our pleasure to expose them to shallow biology research and we sent them the most sincere invitation to our next Open-up Day.
Joint Report
In our practice with people outside biology, we gradually found that production falls so far behind research that the public cannot understand its extraordinary meaning and scientists have difficulty in proving the value in their achievements. Hence, we initiated a joint research on how to apply a new technology to actual production.
In line with the principle of ‘To be more responsible and reflect more’, we jointly conducted a research on the transformation of biotechnology achievements with the iGEM team of Zhejiang University ( ZJU-CHINA ), the University of National Defense Science and Technology ( NUDT_CHINA ) and Ocean University of China ( OUC_CHINA ). Through the clear division of labor, we explored the general mode of the transformation in basic research results, and developed a series of HP activity guidelines and put"

HUST_Cheering
On July 7th, members of team ShanghaitechChina_B attended HUST-CHEERING seminar hosted by Huazhong University of Science and Technology in Wuhan, China. After several days of heavy rains, the city suffered serious water-logging. Power supply was damaged in HUST. Organizers and participants had to move from the hall to the teaching building to continue our seminar. The classrooms were not spacious but were big enough for passionate IGEMers.
Because ShanghaitechChina_B is a newly founded team, we gave a presentation about our project and received many pieces of valuable advice. Experienced IGEMers also gave their encouragement to our team. Our team gained a more comprehensive understanding of IGEM competition through this event and became much more interested in synthetic biology. It was quite an experience to establish friendships with other IGEM teams.
iDPI
Owing to one of the purposes of IGEM that is to improve public awareness and knowledge of synthetic biology, as the first team founded in ShanghaiTech IGEM, we decided to establish an IGEM Day for Public Interests (IDPI). This year, the IDPI invited students and teachers from Shanghai Concordia International High School and held an IGEM Open-Lab Day on Sep 3rd, 2016. Along with another IGEM team at Shanghaitech, we warmly welcomed the visiting delegation from Concordia. Their delegation included two major science teachers and eight students from different grades. We delivered two introduction speeches about and synthetic biology and the IGEM on behalf of two ShanghaiTech IGEM teams respectively. One was done by Haolong Zhu, a member of ShanghaitechChina Team, another was by Shenjian Ai, one of our team member. We introduced our IGEM project Gutrio to these curious visitors. To explain the design of our project, we made analogy of engineered bacteria to trained agents who carried secret weapons to terminate their targets. Thus, we described our potentially complicated experimental system in an understandable manner - an amazing adventure. Those high school students were all cheered up: “It was really cool!”. Our provocative speeches did stimulate their interests to synthetic biology.
After that, we held an open discussion session, where we witnessed the curiosity and passion of these high school students towards synthetic biology and IGEM. We shared many details of"

Utah_State,2013,Team:Utah State#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," to be lethal against many gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria including B. subtilis and S. aureus. A primary reason for our selection of grammistin Pp1 was the high concentration needed to inhibit the growth of E. coli. (Yokota et al., 2001)
CG-Defh1 (BBa_K1162004)
CG-Defh1 originates from immune cells in an oyster species. As a defensin AMP, CG-Defh1 contains four disulfide bonds and is most effective against gram-positive bacteria. The specific mode of action for this AMP is to inhibit peptidoglycan synthesis in the bacterial cell wall. This makes CG-Defh1 unique from many AMPs in that it does not target cell membranes. In fact, it was the first defensin from an invertebrate to exhibit antibacterial properties. Most importantly, CG-Defh1 inhibits the growth of S. aureus, a dangerous cause of nosocomial infections in the world.
Scygonadin (BBa_K1162005)
Scygonadin is produced in a species of mangrove crab to prevent bacterial invasion. It is the primary defense against dangerous microbes that thrive in marine environments. Scygonadin has been shown to be effective in inhibiting both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria including M. leteus, S. aureus, C. glutamicum, and A. hydrophila. This AMP has been previously studied for its production via recombinant DNA in E. coli using a pTrc-CKS vector and a C-terminus 6x His-tag. No studies were done with a 10x His tag or spider silk inserts.  (Peng et al., 2010)
LL-37 (BBa_K1162006)
LL-37 is an antimicrobial peptide (AMP) from the cathelicidin family of antimicrobial peptides, isolated from the Human (Homo sapiens). It is a 37-residue helical peptide found throughout the human body, exhibiting a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity as well as a variety of immunomodulating effects (Dürr, Ulrich H.N., et. al 2006). It has the distinction of being the first and only cathelicidin member discovered from humans, and is extremely well studied and characterized for this reason. The peptide is produced via epithelial cells as well as leukocytes in places such as the skin, gastrointestinal tract, and the respiratory tract. This AMP is is cleaved from a larger"

Toronto,2017,Team:Toronto#Experiments_-_-_TEXT.html," Remember to recalibrate your scales in between measurements.
If you are making LB agar plates, weigh and add 7.5g of agar and swirl to mix. Record the amount added.
Note the contents do not necessarily need to be completely in solution before autoclaving.
Part 2: Autoclaving
Lightly seal the top of the beaker with aluminium foil, and label the beaker with autoclave tape stating LB (agar)–[your name]–[date]–[media number]–iGEM.
Unless you have been trained to use the autoclave, you will not be conducting the following steps in this part
Use appropriate transportation protocols to bring the LB bottle into the autoclave room. Remember to store the beaker in an autoclavable basin, in case of spills.
Check the water level on the autoclave, if necessary. Autoclave on the liquid setting for approximately 20 min.
The contents of the beaker will be hot after autoclaving, therefore take the necessary measures to prevent burns.
After autoclaving, allow the LB media to cool to 55°C before handling.
Use laser thermometer to check the temperature of the glass.
The LB broth can be stored in sterile conditions at room temperature, and should be good for 3-4 months. Flame the lip of the bottle each time the LB is used. If the LB contains antibiotics, store in a -4°C freezer.
However, it is not recommended to store LB with antibiotics as the antibiotics will degrade over time
Part 3: Pouring the plates (for LB agar)
While pouring the plates, it is crucial to maintain a sterile environment. This should be done in room WB 303, with a sterile environment provided by a lit Bunsen burner.
Note: steps 1-3, in addition to the clean up from Part 1, can be done while waiting for autoclave.
Sterilize the workspace with 70% EtOH before depositing your materials. Light the Bunsen burner.
Obtain a stack/roll of empty plates. The plates should still be in their plastic sleeve/wrapping, as they should be sterile. Don’t throw out the wrapping as it can be used to store the plates. It is essential that you minimize any chance of contaminating the plates. Make sure that you open the package at the top and expose the plates as minimally as possible.
Note that this protocol makes ~25 plates.
Once you take the plates out, store them upside down on your lab bench. Label the plates with [your name"

UT-Tokyo,2014,Team:UT-Tokyo#Counter#Project#Project_-_-_TEXT.html,"RNA forms a stem-loop and its ribosomal binding site (RBS) is covered (Fig. 1). Consequently the gene coded in cis-repressed mRNA isn't translated. However if trans-activating RNA exist, crRNA and taRNA are hybridized and RBS gets exposed and translation starts.［3］
<img src = ""
"" class = ""figure"" /> <legend>Fig. 3 The System of a Riboregulator When only cis-repressed RNA (crRNA) exists, the RBS is covered. In the presence of taRNA, stem-loop gets opened and translation is initiated. </legend>
Namely, the gene encoded in crRNA is expressed only when both crRNA and taRNA is transcribed. Therefore this system can be considered as the AND function. For example, consider the gene circuit, Plac-taRNA-d.term-Pbad-cr-RBS-GFP-d.term. (cr is the sequence in crRNA which binds to RBS) If and only if both IPTG and arabinose exists, GFP is expressed. Therefore, the riboregulator regulates the activities of both of the two promoters and produces AND functions.
The construct of the counter in Ari, et al. is as follows.
<img src = ""
"" class = ""figure"" /> <legend>Fig. 4 The Construction of RTC Counter “crRBS” means cis-repressed RBS.</legend>
In the initial state, T7RNAP is transcribed but not translated because of translational inhibition by crRBS. taRNA induced by the first arabinose induction promotes translation of T7RNAP and it initiates transcription of T3RNAP. Translation of T3RNAP is induced by the second induction and it promotes transcription of GFP. GFP is translated by the third induction. This system can be expanded by adding pairs of transcriptional activators and corresponding promoters.

Sigma factors and anti-sigma factors are used for constructing the sigma-memory. Sigma memory is a genetic device which have two states and can memorize the state. Sigma-memory is applied for constructing resettable counter.
Sigma Factor
The sigma factors is promoter recognition subunits of RNA polymerase. A sigma factor is associated with a part of promoters. A sigma factor recruits RNA polymerase to its corresponding promoter and initiates transcription. Sigma factors have great variety. Some of sigma factor-promoter pairs have one-to-one correspondence. Thus, if only sigma factors which have one-to-one correspondence are used, a transcription activating system in which a sigma"

Construction of the regulator plasmids
Thursday, July 5th
Construction of the lasR regulator plasmid (piG0040)
Competent cells were transformed with piG0028 (K553003, lasR) and selected on chloramphenicol-LB-plates. Plasmid DNA was extracted by performing a miniprep. The relevant plasmid sequence was sequenced by Microsynth using the primers oiG0001 and oiG0002. Amplification of lasR by PCR using oiG0003 and oiG0004 resulted in the fragment fiG0004 (1.0 kb). The vector piG0034 (pSEVA 181) was digested with the restriction enzymes HindIII and PacI to fiG0001 (3.0 kb). The two fragments, fiG0001 and fiG0004, were assembled using Gibbson assembly. Thus we used the plasmid backbone of piG0034 and lasR of piG0028 to construct the lasR regulator plasmid piG0040. Competent cells were transformed with piG0040 and selected on ampicillin-LB-plates. Colony PCR using the primers oiG0035 and oiG0036 was conducted to check the size of the inserted fragment (expected bands at 1.0 and 1.2 kb). The sequence was verified by Microsynth using the same primers.

Anderson Promoters
Luminescence measurements
Eleven of the nineteen promoters of the Anderson collection (J23100, J23101, J23102, J23103, J23106, J23107, J23113, J23114, J23115, J23117, J23118) were evaluated. For that purpose, we used the reporter vector pSBBs3C-luxABCDE from the BioBrickBox containing the lux operon
as a reporter for promoter activity. The promoter activity leads to the expression of the lux operon and to the production of the enzyme luciferase. The bioluminescence, which is produced by the luciferase, can be measured with the microtiter plate reader Synergy2 ( BioTek ) (Fig.1).
Fig. 1: Luminescence measurement of Anderson promoters in the reporter vector pSBBs3C-luxABCDE. OD600 (right), Lumi (middle) and Lumi per OD600 (left) depending on the time (h) are shown for two different clones (green/blue). Data derived from three independent experiments, graph shows the mean with standard deviation. Curves were fitted over each other (t=0, OD600=0,3) and smoothed by taking average of three neighboring values.
All clones show a typical growth behaviour. The activity of the promoters increases during transition from log to stationary phase. The maximal promoter activity (t=1h) reaches 200 to 1500 Lumi/OD600 for promoters J23115 and J23101, respectively. Afterwards"

Public Outreach Survey
Introduction
Spreading awareness and interest for synthetic biology can be a difficult task due to the complexity of the field and the fast pace of development. Furthermore, the public scepticism towards genetic engineering and GMOs has been quite strong, at least in Sweden. To explore the awareness of some aspects of synthetic biology and their knowledge about it, our team conducted a survey covering the use of GMOs in household products. The survey also covered some basic concepts within biology, such as DNA and where it can be found. We also went a step further in the pursuit of understanding the public position, in our collaboration with the Istanbul Technical University iGEM team.
In our collaboration, we designed the layout and questions for our survey to be able to compare the differences in people's opinions and knowledge of GMO. The results could then be compared and an analysis of the differences can be used to device future strategies for informing the general public on the use of GMOs in both our countries.
The survey:
The survey consists of 15 questions in total with an initial part covering age, gender and education level to aid in analysis of the results. The questions were first written in English, discussed between two teams’ members. Teams made a joint decision about the questions and then translated to the native languages of each team country (Swedish and Turkish).
Chalmers Team’s Analysis about the Survey:
The participation on the survey was good, with 183 and 875 participants in Sweden and Turkey respectively. Demographically, the diversity was not optimal with over 80 percent of the participants having a university education which is not representative of the population as a whole in either Sweden or Turkey. Correction for this will of course have to be part of the analysis. Furthermore, it should be stated that conclusions drawn here are merely the thought and conclusions drawn by our team and are up for debate. After statistical analysis in"
CLSB-UK,2017,Team:CLSB-UK#Software#Bot_-_-_TEXT.html,"’s very easy to use the software in existing workflows; if your protocols aren’t already on Protocat they simply need to be uploaded and they’d instantaneously be available on our app.
We looked into protocols.io’s API , another protocol database, and contacted the team there to try and get access to the public protocols without the user’s login details. Their cofounder, Alexei Stoliartchouk, informed us that they are working on adding that ability but at the time of writing it had not yet been implemented.
We also looked into sourcing protocols from OpenWetWare . Despite having an immensely useful database the protocols are not in any standard format and thus very difficult to parse automatically. We talked with Michigan Software , who are looking into standardising a protocol format as part of their human practices work.
Testing and feedback
Several teams tested it at the UK meetup, including Judd-UK. Judd suggested the team lookup feature and the ability to repeat a step in the protocol (as opposed to just next and back), both of which we implemented soon after.
Judd also suggested having a command to skip to a particular step. We tried to implement this but found it wasn’t feasible as it caused conflicts with the part lookup feature. This was because the natural language processing algorithms tended to match the numbers to part IDs.
Future work
As it’s open-source (GPLv3 license) and available on Github , other teams are free to build other functions or improve the current ones. In the future all kinds of biological queries could be supported such as looking up particular reagents or safety instructions. It also has the potential to control future IoT lab equipment, such as WiFi-enabled centrifuges or electrophoresis power supplies.

Overview
We began our project early in this year, but wasted lots of time on molecular cloning. We were making mistakes and debugging during most of the time. In July, we tried to build the memory sequential structures at first but failed at last because of leakage. Later, orthogonality of five integrases we have was tested. At the same time, we were tring to change promoter in our two-signal system and still working on this now. Furthermore, we have engaged in InterLab in the mid-summer. Efficiency of five integrases was tested in late September and October.

Biology is much larger than what high school curriculum requires us to teach. Thus,                          as an educator, I am keenly ready to inspire my students with scientific projects                          enabling them to be the scientists of tomorrow. To reach beyond the rigid borders of                          classroom walls, iGEM is the best opportunity for me and for my students. I was always                          interested in synthetic biology and genetic engineering but exploring this world with                          my students is the best part. Although all aspects of iGEM takes hard work, seeing my                          students accomplish things and our project getting put together makes up for it. This is                          officially my fourth year at iGEM. We, as a team, put tremendous effort to our project                          and we are very excited to be a part of the iGEM family."

Manchester,2017,Team:Manchester#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html,"MMs in each related field.
The usage of the GMMs in Korea is strictly regulated by the GMO Law, established on Jan 28, 2001. The Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy takes charge of this law.
2. Who regulates the use of GMMs on a case-by-case basis?
We can distinguish two different administrative ways in which countries decided to regulate the use of GMMs. One way government regulate GMMs is by establishing a special, often non-governmental, organisation, which usually also acts as an information centre in the field of synthetic biology. The other way involves assigning conventional ministries to regulate the use of GMMs in their respective fields.
The European Union, Australia, and Indonesia belong to the first group. For example, in Australia, Gene Technology Regulator Advisory Committee takes charge of making decisions on products’ approval. Competent authorities in the European Union and The Biosafety Commission and The Technical Team for Biosafety in Indonesia have similar roles.
Brazil, Canada, Chile, Korea, India, Japan and the US belong to the second group, where conventional ministries are responsible for their respective fields. Even though the names of these ministries might differ amongst the countries, it seems to be a more prevalent way to regulate GMO. Additional information centres might be present to help the ministries make decisions, nonetheless.
*Click on each flag to see the response of each individual team!*
The US Food and Drug Administration regulates any GMMs that get used in consumer products, such as GMMs in food or cosmetics. The US Department of Agriculture regulates any genetic modification of plants. However, any GMMs that are to be released into the environment are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency.
Manufacturers wishing to make their products available in Canada are required to submit paperwork (including manufacturing and quality control methodologies, pre-clinical and clinical tests, side effects and limitation), as well multiple samples in the case of biologics, to Health Canada. Health Canada will then evaluate the product according to the regulations set out in the Food and Drugs Act, the Food and Drugs Regulations, and the Medical Devices Regulations.
All member countries are obliged to establish ’competent authorities,’ institutions responsible for overseeing the use of GMMs on a case-by-case basis.
It is the role of the Gene Technology Regulator Advisory Committee to assess all data supplied by any applicant (who is intending to release GMMs into the environment) and perform a comprehensive literature review to determine whether or not it will be approved. FSANZ also regulates the use of GMMs in foods for human consumption on an individual case"

The innovation given by Golden Gate assembly was the introduction of type IIS restriction enzymes used for DNA digestion. A current workflow at that time consisted of DNA restriction, gel purification and finally ligation of the single parts. For restriction different type II restriction enzymes were taken making it important to check for compatible buffers and getting a six base pair scar after ligation. By introducing type IIS restriction enzymes into this workflow the system was highly improved. This new method offered many advantages like I) an independent enzyme recognition site that is removed after restriction, II) restriction and ligation in one pot III) directional assembly by conscious design of the cleavage sequences IV) no buffer incompatibilities due to the usage of one enzyme cutting at several spots and still producing different cleavage sequences ( Engler et al., 2008 ).
Figure 1: Golden Gate assembly. Golden Gate assembly introduced the usafe of type IIS restriction enzymes which cut the DNA outside their recognition sites. This way the restriction site is removed from the cutted fragment after the restriction and the resulting overhangs can be designed freely.
Based on this, many new systems arose offering the possibility of building complex constructs out of single genetic parts in a fast, simple and flexible way. Full libraries of standardized genetic parts were developed enabling the user to build full combinatorial libraries. The first system developed was the modular cloning system (MoClo) offering a new hierarchical cloning method of defined biological parts ( Weber et al., 2011 ) and consequently setting a new standard over the years.
Here we summarize some Golden Gate based systems in a chronological manner looking at the improvements over the years and compare their advantages and disadvantages.
Modular Cloning (MoClo) ( Weber et al., 2011 )
The modular cloning system was the first one proposing a standard for Golden Gate based assembly. This toolbox offers 5 types of modules designed mainly for eukaryotes. The modules are stored in level 0 acceptor plasmids derived from the pUC19 backbone with a spectinomycin resistance and a LacZα cassette as dropout for blue/white screening. Custom level 0 plasmids are assembled by flanking the sequences with BpiI recognition sites and setting a single restriction-ligation-reaction with the correspondent plasmid. Up to 5 level 0 modules are assembled in an acceptor plasmid with ampicillin resistance and a LacZα-dropout by restriction with BsaI to transcription units. 6 transcription units can be assembled using BpiI into level 2 multigene constructs containing a kanamycin resistance"
Tec-Chihuahua,2018,Team:Tec-Chihuahua#prueba_-_-_TEXT.html," burn the colonies, quarantine the apiary, and tell the beekeeper he had five days to challenge, after that period, colonies that had symptoms would be burned.
What he would do is he would burn the frames and the columns on the bees and then crush the boxes so the beekeeper couldn't put bees in it anymore, nowadays, gasoline is used. The reason he did that is he wanted to make sure all the honey was destroyed because the honey stores were contaminated with the spores of American foulbrood and if the honey wasn't destroyed, all the apiaries around would get infected. Another way the disease is spread between beekeepers is through the places where honey is processed, they bring honey from different beekeepers or different countries and process it, if it is contaminated and bees get access to it, the disease is spread in the surroundings. Another way of spreading is when a beekeeper wants to buy or sell beehives or equipment that is contaminated because they don't see the symptoms and the person who is selling or buying, doesn't know there is a contamination.
We were curious if there were any biotechnical regulations that apply to bees in Brazil and the US regarding experimental work on them for example, for eradicating diseases. In Brazil they have no regulation affecting research with honey bees, the only regulation is involving bees in the wild. For experimental work, for instance, he is on the ethics committee of the hospital, he mentioned for human research a permission is needed as for animal research, but there are no insects’ permissions.
He offered to contact us to speak with Erica Weinstein Teixeira, she was a student of him, she set up a laboratory and it’s a good bee pathologist. Erika has worked with viruses and diagnosis and said she probably knows about AMPs. He also offered to contact us with more researchers in his lab in case we needed to.
Ultimately, he mentioned American foulbrood was not a problem in Brazil, but in Argentina is. He sent us some papers that could be useful to our research and said it was a good project. We are thankful for his help and for his willingness to keep supporting us.

Glass Cutting
Glass cutting was carried out to adapt the shape of dichroic mirrors to fit within the epicube that we designed for fluorescence microscopy. Precautions were taken to ensure that small fragments of glass do not come into contact with eyes or skin. Glass cutting was carried out on a large tray, preventing stray glass fragments being left around the lab; safety glasses, two pairs of gloves and a lab coat were worn at all times when cutting glass. Risk assessments were completed for the activity and students were supervised by the first-aider on hand. These can be found below (note: signatures were removed from the forms for privacy reasons).
In the final design of the epicube, the mirrors are incorporated into plastic drawers, so the user does not come in direct contact with any pieces of glass.

How secure is our lab?
Our work took place in the Teaching Lab, Department of Plant Sciences, University of Cambridge. The lab is GM certified and biosafety level 1 certified, and so is designed with safety precautions in place for working with genetically modified organisms.
What safety practices have we adopted?
Safety was a high priority when selecting a project to work on. Due to safety concerns several project ideas were discarded during brainstorming. Before carrying out any lab work we were given an extensive safety briefing and lab induction by the departmental safety officer. Standard laboratory procedures were followed at all times. Correct equipment was worn when doing any wet lab work. Cleaning and disposal of equipment was carried out appropriately by considering the hazard level associated. All relevant laws and regulations regarding biosafety were followed.

Finally, we could characterize R0011 at high IPTG concentration correctly. However, characterization of R0011 at low IPTG concentration may be required additional measurements.

This conclusion provides directions for wet lab experiments, which is to make the concentrations of yeasts and flagellin monomers as high as experimentally convenient, and to culture the system for about 10 hours.
As mentioned above, some of the parameters in the simulation were derived from literature. To better reflect reality, experiments can be conducted to measure these parameters. However, the qualitative results of our model will most likely hold.
If in future efforts, an estimation of the length distribution of the filaments formed on the yeast surface is needed, one can refer to the model proposed by Kashchiev (2015), who gave equations that could predict the concentrations of filaments of every length.

TU-Munich,2013,Team:TU-Munich#Project#Physcomitrella_-_-_TEXT.html," a great chassis that could bring iGEM closer to the real world applications we were looking for. Therefore we contacted Prof. Dr. Reski, who is a recognized expert on Physcomitrella patens and its biotechnological applications.
Prof. Dr. Reski liked our idea of introducing his Physco to iGEM from the very beginning and offered his help wherever we would need it. Members of our team traveled to his lab in Freiburg (350 km) five times in total [1] to fetch plasmids known to be functional in Physcomitrealla patens or for discussions with him or his co-workers. We could win him over as an advisor for our team, which shows how iGEM brings together universities and scientific groups from many different places.
Advantages as a new chassis for iGEM
As a plant, P. patens offers interesting opportunities for application as it is self sustaining, renewable and a natural part of our environment. Therefore it is much easier to implement it into real world scenarios than bacteria or yeast. And although there is the disadvantage of having to wait about 4-6 weeks after transformation until experiments can be done, this is still very short considering the high complexity of the organism. Working with P. patens can easily be done in the timeframe of the competition by preparing the DNA constructs in bacteria.
P. patens is a well studied model organism which means that besides having its full genome sequenced in 2006 there are well equipped databases . Furthermore, there exists an International Moss Stock Center (IMSC) in which many ecotypes, mutants and transgenic strains of P. patens are stored and accessible to the scientific community. So there is enough knowledge and material to work on for synthetic biologists.
At the same time the moss offers access to very exciting new physiological processes since it is a much more complex multicellular eukaryotic organism than the chassis already established in iGEM.
P. patens is an easy plant to work with and requires neither expensive maintenance facilities nor large laboratory space. Most of the basic tools for high precision mutagenesis have been tested on this plant, were found to work and are easily available (see Moss methods below).
Moss methods - working with Physcomitrella
The techniques used for the cultivation and manipulation of Physcomitrella patens are based on the knowledge of the chair for Plantbiotechnology of Prof. Dr. Reski at Freiburg University, which are available at Plant-Biotech.net .

NAWI_Graz,2017,Team:NAWI Graz#HP#Gold_-_-_TEXT.html," much discussion,             we decided that these strains are the safest variant for our planned experiment.
Another problem we solved with the aid of an expert was the time delay from the production of the proteins till their             degradation. After endless discussions, we came up with the solution to integrate a TEV-protease which accelerated             the subsequent degradation.
Finally, for the fluorescence proteins a problem occurred referring the detection. Originally it was planned to detect             the proteins after induction by means of a plate reader or through the robot, but since the fluorescence signal             was way too low we had no chance in proving the presence of the proteins. Coincidentally, we came up with this             problem during our discussion evening, which led to a lively discussion. Many solutions came up, finally we could             agree that a Western Blot would be the most promising variant. And indeed, we have succeeded in detecting the             protein. We are currently working on improving the fluorescence intensity. During Nerd Nite, we discussed possible             improvements with dedicated students. Their intellectual approaches were very interesting, some of them have             been implemented. The students were very enthusiastic that they were able to contribute to our project.
Some experts were able to support us with new input, in which areas our project could develop in the future. Many             novel ideas that on how this project might emerge are listed in the application section. There, many speculative new ideas are described and some of our team members hope             to be able to help bring them to life in the course of our scientific career.
Model
At the beginning of our project, we already had a model of our entire experimental process. Thus, we were able to             take this to public events, such as the “Spritzerstandl”. There, we got a lot of input from the public and even made fundamentally changes on how             the robot works. After fierce discussions, the pH-based controller has been improved by several aspects, instead             of just reacting to sensors' left and right input signals, additionally a kind of memory has been introduced             into the system through the creative use of the “bacterial medium”. By this, the robots could no longer get stuck in corners of the maze.
In addition, the model was sent to various other iGEM teams , who also created individually mazes. Unfortunately,             we did not have time to solve this with our physical robot, but we can show in the model that this would theoretically             be feasible.

At the meet-up, each team described the background and core theory of their project and raised valuable questions for other teams. SZU_China purposed an important experimental hypothesis linking Human Beta Defensin 3 ( hBD3 ) to motor protein             so that hBD3 can not be transported outside the bacteria.
We learned more about projects of other teams and had further understanding about synthetic biology.

Usage
What you need
Using the light box and performing light experiments is easy and can be done in every lab. All you need for your experiments is the following:
The uniBOX ( see construction )
A common box to keep the samples in dark
A room that can be made impervious to light (even a store room would serve perfectly well)
An incubator (also impervious to light in the optimal case)
2 LED light chains (one for the light box and one for the ""dark"" room to get your save light conditions)
A radiometer to measure light intensities
Principles of light experiments
In principle every light experiment works similar. All you have to do is to proceed your samples under safe light in the dark room. Otherwise it is indispensable to keep your samples in the uniBOX or dark box  to protect them from sunlight and artificial light. Even inside of the incubator this protection is important.  Safe light are light conditions that do not affect your light experiments. That means if you are doing a red light experiment it is important that the safelight does not include wavelengths form 600 to 700 nm. Therefore the safe light conditions for red light can be green light or blue light.  As green light contains less energy it is probably the best choice. Nearly every common green LED can be used to produce safe green light.
For blue light experiments red LEDs can be used to produce safe light conditions.
Set up the light box
For some light experiments it may be of great importance to regulate the light intensity. Using the uniBOX you can do this by adding layers of baking paper between the LEDs and your samples. For very small light intensities you can use normal paper instead of baking paper. The appropriate place to add these papers was described here . The light intensity in general can be measured using a radiometer.
Method, Results and Discussion
To test our light Box (uniBOX) we performed a spatio-temporal gene expression experiment by using a red light inducible Tet-Off system (TetR fused to PIF and VP16 fused to PhyB) (Müller et al., 2013). To get more information about the general functionality of the PhyB - PIF red light system klick here . TetR is able to bind to a TetO DNA target side that was cloned in front of a CMV minimal promotor driving an mCherry reporter gene. Therefore after an illumination with 660 nm the gene activation domain VP16 will be brought to TetR resulting in an expression of mCh"

Module Integration
In order for us to achieve our goal of having a relay race between GFP and RFP teams,
various parts from the the three modules must be integrated together into a single working system. What follows is a description of the requirements for the integrated system.
Signal Plasmid
The signal plasmid will contain the following features:
oriTR - to allow transfer during conjugation
constitutively expressed trbK - to block backward propagation of the signal, to reduce redundant transfer, and to prevent lethal zygosis
constitutively expressed trbC - if lethal zygosis turn out to be a problem (undetermined)
constitutively expressed GFP for the green team and RFP for the red team
delay device
input: the delay is triggered by the presence of the helper plasmid
output: expression of the I-SceI homing endonuclease
cut sites for the I-SceI homing endonuclease
a low copy backbone to allow the endonuclease to destroy the signal plasmid
Helper Plasmid
The helper plasmid will consist of a modified R751 plasmid with the following features:
trbK knockout to allow cells containing the helper plasmid to conjugate
oriTR knockout to prevent transfer of the helper plasmid during conjugation
trbC knockout to prevent lethal zygosis (undetermined)
constitutively expressed trigger for the delay device
Initiator Cells
In our proposal the signal is started by placing Initiator Cells into a culture of calls capable of transmitting the signal. Special care must be taken with these cells so that the self-destruction timer is not activated before placing the cells into the communication medium, otherwise your signal plasmid will dissapear at some point while you are culturing the Initiator Cells. Several strategies can be used to avoid this:
The start of the delay can be linked to the presence of some external initiator such as IPTG.
A different type of cell can be made to initiate the signal."

Vincent made glycerol stocks for the two mutants (Y42F, V36F -- 4 colonies each). He also miniprepped these populations with resulting concentrations being:
Y42F 47.2 ng/uL
V36F 31.4 ng/uL
These concentrations are low because a small amount ( 1 mL) of the liquid culture was used. If need be, the remaining 3 mL of the liquid culture can be taken out of the -4 degree fridge and used for re-doing a larger miniprep.
On the Gibthon front, Bill of Cambridge has released the most recent version of Gibthon for all to see. It has many more features than any of the previous releases, including the current version at gibthon.org (Gibthon Construct Designer). Some of these features are either features we thought we could add or are additional features that work well and enhance the program. Vincent will brainstorm this weekend about ways to further enhance the code and will present these ideas on Tuesday.
Lilia minpreped muTetR variants selected according to the colony PCR results and made glycerol stocks. Miniprep results:
1.5 237ng/µl | 2.2 142ng/µl | 2.5  150ng/µl | 3.1 142ng/µl | 3.3 152ng/µl     4.2 64ng/µl   | 4.3 140ng/µl   | 5.1 69ng/µl     | 5.3  65ng/µl     | 6.2 44ng/µl
Nadine miniprepped the pSB3K1-pConst-TetR ligated plasmids since all the colonies were still white. She also miniprepped the J13521 (ptet-RFP) and J13522 (ptet-GFP) plasmids from registry, and made glycerol stocks for all of them.

All the LB bottles were contaminated therefore Alessandro made new ones. By now just one bottle at a time should be used by iGEMers in order to avoid multiple contamination. (take the one labeled ""use me"")
Alessandro ran the gel for the extension PCR on RFP and for gene-specific PCR on T4. In the picture there's the result: we miss a signal from T7"

(2) 計時功能
      在養菌期時系統是關閉狀態；當外加定量乳糖時，開關會被開啟；而乳糖濃度會因降解而慢慢變低至殆盡，此時開關將會再度關閉。因此，只要開啟及關閉時輸出不同訊號，我們將可以得知乳糖降解的這段時間長度；而這段降解時間可藉由改變乳糖的初濃度控制，進而得到計時功能。
(3) 輸出訊號
      我們以綠螢光蛋白及紅螢光蛋白做訊號輸出：綠色表示開啟，而紅色表示關閉。 我們在LacI-repressed 啟動子 (R0011) 後方直接接上綠螢光蛋白的基因序列，當開關開啟時，啟動子被啟動，並直接使綠螢光蛋白表現。另外，由LacI-repressed啟動子間接控制紅螢光蛋白的轉譯。其中，計時功能與偵菌功能將共用此輸出方式。

When both promoters are activated, both sequences (the blue and the red one) are transcribed.  The blue RNA sequence possesses also homology with the red one. But the sequence that can anneal is longer stronger and is therefore more stable than the self annealing of the red sequence. When transcribed, the blue and the red sequences will match together and release the rbs, allowing efficient translation of the recombinase.
Our strategy
These publications ""Genetic switchboard for synthetic biology applications"" and ""Engineered riboregulators enable post-transcriptional control of gene expression"" inspired us. We choose to design different riboswitches keeping some sequences from the original one and changing some nucleotides. This would allow to have one specific riboregulation system for each input, avoiding potential conflicts between riboregulators.
Deeper in the design: RNA secondary structures formation
Here are presented secondary structures of two riboregulators, R0 and R1. The RBS blocking seqence anneals with a strong hairspin to the RBS. The interfering RNA has a free-end sequence complementary to an unlocking sequence of the RBS blocking RNA. When they are both transcribed, the interaction between the two RNAs let free the RBS sequence and the translation is restored.

KU_Leuven,2015,Team:KU Leuven#Future#Economic potential analysis_-_-_TEXT.html,". To be issued with a CE                 mark, medical devices must achieve high quality, safety and performance                 standards. (9) However the specificity of our device, which is based on the                 precipitation by bacteria, could possibly be subject to the regulation of                 genetically modified organisms. The narrow legal framework concerning GMO's in                 Europe could affect and delay the innovation process of our orthopaedic device.                 The ambiguity and lack of clarity to which regulation our application can be                 applied, shows the need for the realignment of regulation with practice and                 current state-of-technology.

Human capital gap
Knockaert et al. suggested that “One of the principal challenges facing                 university spin-outs is academic entrepreneurs tending to possess little                 commercial human capital.” (5) The fact that they are experts in their domain                 does not make them the perfect marketers for their product. As showed above, the                 orthopaedic industry is characterised by a certain set of aspects. Appropriate                 managers will more likely find more adapted ways of dealing with these                 differences. Besides there are possible conflicts of interest with the                 traditional roles of research and teaching that might pop up when academic                 entrepreneurs need to run a business. (10) Raising venture capital should also                 be done by an entrepreneur who possesses lots of commercial human capital. This                 shows clearly that the different challenges are interrelated. (5)
Desired approach for the market introduction
The orthopaedic device industry is currently confronted with a rising demand for                 new orthopaedic hip prosthesis. To deal with this, we came up with a brand                 new device based on the use of bacteria. However we described three major                 barriers that can potentially disturb the realization of its economic potential.                 The purpose of this section is not to provide an exhaustive description of a                 go-to-market-strategy or business plan, but rather briefly offering some                 guidelines that need to be kept in mind to secure a bright future perspective.
Parallel to tissue engineered products, where they also work with cells (10) , the                 end product is highly customized and falls under the ‘Make to Order’ approach.                 In view of the high demand of orthopaedic products, this will not be sufficient                 to establish a competitive supply model that is capable of gathering a                 significant part of the market. The way to deal with this obstacle should be to                 identify all the parts that can be automated and scaled-up already in an early                 stage of the development process in order to satisfy a mass market. (10) In order to commercialize the device, there should also be"

Cell Cycle Dependent Promoter: Pnrd
As described in the systems page , a cell division dependent promoter is essential for the functioning of our intergenerational phenotypic switching device. Stanford-Brown iGEM 2012 documented the characterisation of Promoter Pnrd ( BBa_K847211 ) and confirmed its functionality. However, since it was submitted in RFC[25] standard, the part was redesigned in RFC[10] to deal with the possible disadvantages of RFC[25] standard.
Sequencing results of Pnrd RFC[10]
The results of sequence show that the improved part contains the RFC[10] prefix and suffix.
Reconstructed in the RFC[10] format, the Pnrd promoter was ligated in front of part BBa_E0240 and compared to the standard promoter BBa_J23101. The measurement was made"
