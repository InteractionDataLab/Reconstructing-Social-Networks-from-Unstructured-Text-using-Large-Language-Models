Improved mlrA: BBa_K1378001 to BBa_K2888010
Previous Parts: mlrA BBa_K1378001
MlrA is a 28kDa protease found in Sphingomonas sp. which can cleavage microcystins(MCs). MlrA is one part of the gene cluster responsible for the ability of MC degradation. The cluster includes four ORFs, mlrA, mlrB, mlrC and mlrD, which can hydrolyze MCs and facilitate absorption of the products as carbon source. MlrA is sometimes referred as a metalprotease by inhibitor studies. MlrA can cleavage the Adda-Arg bond and causes ring opening. The first-step linearized product shows much weaker hepatoxin compared with MCs. In the experiment of mouse bioassay, up to 250 mg/kg of linearized MC-LR shows no toxicity to mouse, much higher than 50% lethal dose 50mg/kg of cyclic MC-LR. Furthermore, the linearization also raise the median inhibition concentration to 95nM, around 160 times higher than original 0.6nM.
Our Improved Parts: tagged mlrA BBa_K2888010
/
Description: This BioBrick is an improvement on the one created by the Peking 2014 team (BBa_K1378001). Our composite part within prefix and suffix consists of the most commonly used promoter, RBS, 6x His tag and terminator, as well as our functional coding sequence --- mlrA gene. This composite part is assembled through Gibson Assembly; then, it is fused with linearized vector, pSB1C3 backbone, via infusion. Ultimately, we successfully extract plasmids which contain our target gene from transformed bacteria. Furthermore, we improved mlrA parts BBa_K1378001 by purposely adding 6x His tag into our sequence in order to improve the efficacy and efficiency of expression and purification; it will also strengthen effects of binding to Ni-NTA column, making it possible to immobilize proteins"

Bilateral talk with BNU-China
BNU-China team invited us to their lab on September 24th, a bilateral talk about the details of equipment collaboration on Enzyme-labeled Instrument and Flow Cytometer, as well as the general design of our gift daily iGEM greatly promoted communication between UCAS-China and BNU-China. iGEMers from BNU-China were warm and reliable, we were so glad to share work and ideas with such a group of friends! Wish both teams have excellent performance in Giant Jamboree!
Daily iGEM
We collaborate with BNU-China to present a gift for the world, Daily iGEM. We had a bonus part to send greetings from more than 15 iGEM teams from all over China.Including BNU-China , Jiangnan , Nanjing-China , NEU_China_A , NKU_CHINA , NUDT_CHINA , OUC-China , SCAU-China , Tianjin , TUST_China , XJTU-China and XMU-China .
Know more about Daily iGEM on our Gifts for the world page .
Offering equipment and experimental help to BNU-China
In Beijing-Tianjin iGEM Alliance Establishing Conference, we UCAS-China team communicated with many teams. Knowing many teams were bothered by the limitations in equipment using, we expressed our willingness of offering help as possible as we can. Since we had usage permission in using two well-equipped laboratories in Institute of Biophysics, CAS and Institute of Microbiology, CAS, when iGEMers from BNU-China asked us whether we could allow them to use our Enzyme-labeled Instrument and Flow Cytometer to monitor the fluorescence emissions of their engineered bacteria, we agreed without hesitation.
Before conducting the experiment, we offered advice on the design of their protocol. We helped to detect both OD and fluorescence intensity of samples in different concentrations simultaneously to evaluate the function of their bacteria. After, we engaged in the analysis of the result. With our help, they needn’t get up and take samples early in the morning but can obtain a much larger amount of data, saving them trouble and improving the reliability. We also mentored them when they came to use the Enzyme-labeled Instrument in Institute of Microbiology, CAS. In addition, we helped prepare the samples for flow cytometry, enabling them to get more precise data. See their result!"

Microbiological Methods
Cultivation of E.coli
E.coli strain XL1-Blue was cultivated in LB-medium (lysogeny broth) and LB plates.  for the preparation of 1 liter of LB, dissolve the following and autoclave:
10 g tryptone
5 g yeast extract
10 g NaCl
For making plates, add 15 g bacto-agar before autoclaving.
Heat Shock Transformation of E.coli with Plasmid DNA
Before transformation, CaCl2 competent cells were produced after Cohen et al., 1972. For the production of competent cells, 50 ml LB medium were inoculated with an overnight culture of the used ‘’E.coli’’ strain and incubated at 37 °C, 180 rpm. After an OD 550 of 0,5 was reached, the culture was centrifuged for 4 minutes at 5000 g for 10 minutes. The pellet was then resuspended in 40 ml pre-chilled in 0,1 M MgCl2 solution, centrifuged again and resuspended in 20 ml of pre-chilled 0,05 M CaCl2 solution. After 30 minutes of incubation on ice, the cells were centrifuged and resuspended in 2 ml 0,05 M CaCl2 solution, 15 % v/v glycerol. The competent cells were aliquoted and stored an – 80 °C. For the transformation, 100 µl competent cells and 1 ng plasmid or 5 µg of a ligation product were mixed and incubated for 30 minutes on ice. Afterwards, the cells were heat shocked at 37 °C for 5 minutes, then mixed with 2 ml LB medium and incubated at 180 rpm and 37 °C for 30-45 minutes. The transformed cells were then plated on LB medium containing an antibiotic.
Physcomitrella Methods
The techniques used for the cultivation and manipulation of Physcomitrella patens are based on the knowledge of the chair for Plantbiotechnology of Prof. Dr. Reski at Freiburg University which are availible at Plant-Biotech.net .

To produce economic biofuel which could be put into mass production, we wanted to transform alkane-producing Membrane Accelerator into Cyanobacteria. Cyanobacteria is an autotrophic species which could utilize carbon dioxide and light to produce varieties of organics. Someday we might engineered a new strain of Cyanobacteria carrying alkane-producing Membrane Accelerator, which could produce and export alkane effectively just by utilizing carbon dioxide and light. Thus the energy crisis would no longer be a problem.

Again we discovered only slightly increased output with the addition of the sensitivity tuners. These results, coupled with a size check of our final parts being much smaller than expected, led us to believe that we had not actually created the final construct we designed. This error could be attributed to the fact that our second intermediate part was already in a chloramphenicol backbone and so trying to do a ligation from one chloramphenicol backbone to another would not guarantee us the part we wanted. After doing another size check of the intermediates, we were able to submit the PO Promoter and GFP combination (K10420013), and we are now in the process of constructing and carrying out preliminary testing on our improved Cadmium Sensor.

Synthlab Overview

Experiment: Gibson Assembly of gene casettes
After two days in the cabinet incubator, the red colonies (RFP) were easily distinguishable from the white colonies (maybe succesful transformants). In total 12 colonies were to be found of the 3 agar plates, and these were isolated for a second round of colony PCR on the gibson transformants, Gel of 1st and 2nd round of colony PCT:
The colony PCR of the white colonies from the 10th of september (today) all seem to be succesful gibson transformants. Colony 1-4 have been prepared as an O/N culture for miniprep tomorrow.
11/9/2018
Experiment: Gibson Assembly of gene cassettes.
Colony 1-4 had been grown O/N and 0.5 ml was transfered to a glycerol stock and placed at -80 C. The rest of the O/N culture was miniprepped. The resulting concentration of plasmids can be seen here. Plasmid 0063 has been sent to sequencing.   Experiment: 3A assembly of composite parts.
We PCR amplified sequnces of 0056, 0057 and 0058 to increase their concentration for sequencing. In addition, we have prepaired an O/N culture of 0056, 0057 and 0058, but it is not certain we will need them. The plasmids have been sent to sequencing to be verified.
12/9/2018
Experiment: 3A assembly of NTC resistance gene
As the hph selection marker may not be a viable option in A. oryzae, we have decided to trying NTC as a selection marker. The Nat1 gene has been PCR amplified to contain the BioBrick prefix and suffix in a previous experiment. Now we will assemble it into a plasmid with a promoter and terminator. As with a lot of the consructs, we are testing different promoters and we will also be doing that here.
Experiment: Digestion.
We started with assembling the Nat1 gene together with PcamV (0028), pTrpC (0018) or pGpdA (0008). We are using RFP (0024) as the backbone. The reason for"

A3 Assembly
Diagram Explaination
The above diagram is an example of the A3 Assembly that we used to combine to basic parts into a composite part.  This one shows the creation of K675004 that has the ArsR-regulated promoter coupled to the GFP generator.  Both parts assemble in the right order because of the way that they are cut with restriction enzymes.  They only have one plasmid that they can go into and that one is tetracycline resistant so we selected for the transformed bacteria with tetracycline.  After a while we chose large colonies and grew them in LB-AMP because they could grow quicker and we could extract more DNA.  We ran the parts that we made on argarose gel electrophoresis to check the sizes.

Penn,2014,Team:Penn State#Daily Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," third genome overlap. See the schematic here for more information.
Plates show only two colonies, one each from ""slow"" GFP and ""slow insertion time"" GFP. These colonies sampled, grown in cultures.
Wednesday, June 18, 2014
Digested the HMF pathway with EcoRI-HF and PstI-HF restriction enzymes. All PCR's of the third genome overlap containing dCas9 failed, and we realized we must complete the first plasmid by inserting dCas9 and use that as a template instead of the original dCas9 plasmid. This points the failure of the ligation to either the dCas9 PCR's or the ligase buffer has expired. We made new aliquots of fresh ligase buffer to test whether this was the case. We have run out of ClaI and cannot digest dCas9 until this arrives. Our strategy now is to Gibson assembly the Lambda Red Recombinase system and dCas9, then PCR Rescue and ligate into plasmid 1 using XhoI/SalI-HF and XbaI to mitigate the lack of ClaI.
Plasmid prep on cultures from colonies that grew after transformation. New hypothesis develope: perhaps the higher expression GFPs killed the cells due to their extremely rapid translation elongation, leaving only the less efficiently translated GFP carrying cells to live. Online check using website Genscript and their free gene analysis tool shows that the common GFP scores a perfect 1.0 and the rare GFP a perfect 0.0 on their scale (from 0 being not optimized at all to 1 being perfectly optimized). This reveals that the algorithm used by Genscript corresponds directly to the codon usage profile for E.coli over the entire genome.
Thursday, June 19, 2014
Conducted 2-part Gibson CBA to assemble the Lambda Red Recombinase system and the dCas9 system.
Many more RBS library calculations run, some using a method where the Shine Dalgarno (SD) sequence is mutated, but not the rest of the initial condition. Hopefully this will speed up the calculations and finally yield some high TIR libraries that evenly span the range we are looking for. Another overnight culture of slow GFP/slow insertion time GFP cells innoculated.

Cologne-Duesseldorf,2017,Team:Cologne-Duesseldorf#Eric_-_-_TEXT.html," membrane anchors that can be fused to you protein of interest C-terminally as well as N-terminal. This allows you to add proteins to the compartment that never been introduced to the peroxisomal membrane before.
Scientific background
Peroxisomal membrane proteins are synthesized on free polysomes in the cytosol and afterwards integrated into the membrane via two major pathways: one dependent on the endoplasmatic reticulum and one dependent on PEX19 and PEX3.
PEX19-dependent
ER-dependent
Experimental Work/Design
In order to test our hypothesis we fused the last 59 amino acids of the C-terminus of human PEX26 (AA 246-305) to a red fluorescent protein, to further elucidate the Pex3 /Pex19-dependent import. mRuby is generally used as a marker in combination with a fluorescent microscope to visualize the localization of the fusion protein. The C-terminus of PEX26 contains a helical signal-anchor, which serves as both, a mPTS and transmembrane domain. We designed our construct with mRuby2 fused to the N-terminal side of the PEX26 -C-terminus, this way the mRuby should face the cytosolic side of the peroxisomal membrane.    Quite similar to our mRuby- PEX26 approach, we designed a construct for the ER-dependent import. Therefore, we fused the mRuby2 fluorescent protein to the N-terminus of Pex3 (AA 1-39). This construct should be N-terminally anchored in the peroxisomal membrane, with mRuby2 again facing the cellular lumen.
Our main goal is to introduce a rather complex membrane protein to the peroxisome that can alter specific traits. For that we fused the Pex3 N-terminus (AA 1-39) to a Halobacterium salinarum bacteriorhodopsin protein (AA 16-262), replacing the first 16 amino acids ( Pex3 -BacR). The original archaeal bacteriorhodopsin acts as a proton pump by capturing light energy to move protons across the membrane out of the cell. The resulting proton gradient is subsequently converted into chemical energy.  Our assumption is that the first transmembrane segment determines the orientation of the following protein and that therefore due to the N-terminal anchoring signal the bacteriorhodopsin will be inserted in reverse orientation, pumping the protons into the peroxisome. This way the pH of the peroxisomal lumen could"
LZU-China,2015,Team:LZU-China#chz project_-_-_TEXT.html,"1.1  The composition of BBa_K1755305
We connected BBa_K346002£¨PmerT£©, as a promoter, with BBa_1755003£¨RBS+ribB CDS+B0014£©to get BBa_K1755305.
2.1.2  How does it work
PmerT is a kind of promoter from Tn21 mercury resistance (mer) operon. When there is no Hg2+, it cannot start the transcription. Upon binding the cognate metal ions, the metallated MerR homodimer causes a realignment of the promoter so that RNA polymerase contacts the -35 and -10 sequences leading to open complex formation and transcription. (see more details http://  parts.igem.org /Part:BBa_K346002).
So PmerT promoter can be induced by Hg2+ and start the coding of ribB downstream to increase the output of riboflavin. And there is some quantity relationship about the concentration of Hg2+ and the production of riboflavin. We can calculate the the concentration of Hg2+ by our ‘Micro Holmes’ system.
2.1.3 Results
We transformed BBa_K1755305 into E.coli BL-21. Then we detected the concentration of riboflavin through measuring the absorbance under 444nm. Unfortunately, we didn't find that riboflavin production respond to the change of Hg2+ concentration, which indicated that BBa_K1755305 can not work as we anticipated.

3.1.1  The composition
We used BBa_K911003 as a promoter and connected it with BBa_1755003£¨RBS+ribB CDS+B0014£©to get 3.1  BBa_K1755024.
3.1.2  How does it work
BBa_K911003 is a fluoride sensitive riboswitch that is highly sensitive to the F-. It is a positive regulator so F- can induce the promoter to transcript. Since the report gene is at the downstream of fluoride promoter, the riboflavin production can be influenced by the change of F- concentration. So we can use the concentration of riboflavin to determine the concentration of F- and even apply into our ‘Micro Holmes’ system.

"
Exeter,2015,Team:Exeter#diary_-_-_TEXT.html," the lab last week we spent our time working out what was causing MORE issues with the Interlab study. Our focus in the lab will hopefully soon turn towards our project but we refuse to be beaten by a lack of glowing E. coli.
July
Week Five   29/6 - 5/7
Lab action shot
This week’s main focus was constructing the sequence of the toehold switch, which was challenging, but good progress was made concerning the ribosome binding site, loop region, trigger, linker and GFP sequences.  Our wiki is now beginning to take shape nicely with new team member profiles being constructed in addition to some photos of the lab team in action.  The collaboration aspect of our project was addressed as we contributed to an iGEM newsletter about the aims and focus of our project.  At the end of the week our focus shifted slightly to creating a project name and logo, which saw the establishment of Ribonostics (riboswitch+diagnostics). On Wednesday, we headed to the pub for teambuilding round two, which ended in a casual paper aeroplane competition dominated by the physicists.
Week Six   6/7 - 12/7
We have a first draft of our toehold switch! NUPACK has been the main agenda this week. Double and triple checking every part of our sequence means the sequence is nearly ready. Overall this week has been highly successful. At the beginning of the week, three of the outreach team headed into the Devon countryside to visit the head of a Veterinary practice. Hearing some first hand experiences of dealing with Bovine TB was extremely useful and we were also told of how our test would be implemented in the field. Taking this on board we made some considerations about the best direction to take the project from now on. Not to mention we made a very useful contact. As our project is extremely relevant in our local area we believe the ‘Beyond the Bench’ aspect of our project has huge potential. From the responses we have received so far it seems we are correct. Everyone is very engaged in what we are doing. We may be branching as far as New Zealand…Hopefully we have some exciting collaboration with fellow teams to come soon!
On Tuesday we headed out for a cheeky Nandos to celebrate Georgina’s birthday, followed by a few pints at a lovely old pub. Wednesday we decided to have an impromptu barbecue due to the nice weather. BBQ skills were questionable but everyone made it in on Thursday morning unharmed. Next week we have some important milestones we hope to reach.

Collaboration
The Wits CSIR iGEM team collaborated with Imperial College London, both for the modelling and the potential suitability of motility experiments in the testing of our machines. The biologists in our team and those at Imperial College London had a number of skype conferences to discuss the progress of our lab work as well as to share insight into both qualitative and quantitative assay for motility.
We provided Imperial College London with some ideas regarding motility assays using TTC in stab agar. Their team gave us some tips about the preparation of cells for motility experiments and recommended spinning down the bacteria and resuspending them in a low volume of broth to increase the density of cells. They also recommended the use of capillary motility assays.  There was an exchange of protocols both ways to aid in the set-up of our experiments. A week later we discussed the progress we had made in the lab. We gave each other tips and suggested more assays to indicate the ability of our bacteria to move towards a stimulus. Imperial College London shared with us a type of capillary assay they were performing at the time and we, too, shared a protocol with them which is detailed in Gullivan and Topps (2006) paper, Guiding bacteria with small molecules and RNA.
Collaboration was also performed between the engineers to improve the modeling for both the teams. Several Skype conferences were held between the team from Imperial College London and the Wits CSIR team to discuss the design and theory behind our own chemotaxis models. The collaborative effort resulted in the Imperial College London kindly providing us with a model for our theophylline riboswitches. Their modelling results are as follows:
The Wits CSIR iGEM team intend to use a riboswitch to reprogram the chemotactic behavior of E.coli. The project includes engineering the attraction of the bacteria to theophylline"

Mathematical model
Q1: The general mathematical model seems to cope with two nodes coupling together at most. How about more than two nodes?
A1: In current version, we allow more than two nodes reaction function as user-defined form which requires the users to input themselves. Actually, it is easy to add more than two nodes form reaction functions in the model. But the computation time and RAM space will become bad. For the next version, we will change our data structure to accommodate more types but more efficient.
Input
Q1: The input box and steps for users is a little complicated and even have some small requirements for the users to be capable of transform rate equations to differential equations. It has confused me a little.
A1: So far, this input box is perhaps the simplest one after discussing a lot with our USTC wet team. By proposing many possible solutions, they chose this one. After the publishing of current version, we hope feedback from users can help improve the next version.
Algorithm
Q1: Can this software run faster and faster?
A1: Firstly, in our software, we choose and modify these best optimization algorithms carefully by comparing with possible optimization algorithm. How to improve the efficiency of optimization algorithm is an open problem in computer science and mathematics. Collaboration with experts in this field is needed.
Secondly, the speed is quite dependent on the performance of computer. We test these programs separately on Linux system in our high performance workstation. The result is fairly better than the test on our personal computer.
Thirdly, to improve the algorithm performance, parallel computing is a better choice. For this reason, the algorithms we adopt are parallel in nature and extension to parallel algorithm is possible. In the future, we will rewrite our software this form.
Q2: Can this software run more and more precise?
A2: The imprecision is largely caused by Local minimum and initial value dependence. Similar as above, these are also open problems. For we adopt Monte Carlo sampling in our algorithm, the results may vary time to time due to the randomness nature. It also remains a problem for us to solve in the future. We will make effort to modify existing algorithms or even create new one.
Output
Q1: Is it better to export a graph following SBGN standard?
A1: Currently, we are working on it. The basic"

3. Different synthetic pathway of colors and flavors
4. The Resveratrol
5. Scale-up to artisanal and industrial scale
Conclusion
Overview
Our iGEM Bordeaux team 2013 has worked on the development of new lactic ferments able to produce flavours on their own and resveratrol also, a molecule which is considered to be responsible of good effects of red wine. This project will allow on the long run an easier production of flavoured yogurts with beneficial effects on the organisms and medical properties without using chemical substances. On top of that yogurt can be produced in an industrial way or on a small scale , the project can be used on one of those two scales.
The yoghurt's choice
The economic issues have ever been an important concern for agronomic industries. How to produce better, faster and cheaper? New technologies help us to improve yields and decrease production rates. Progress in Health and Biotechnologies fields let us to intend fortified food with healthy and curative compounds.
« Yogurt or yoghurt or yoghourt is a fermented milk product (soy milk, nut milks such as almond milk, and coconut milk can also be used) produced by bacterial fermentation of milk. The bacteria used to make yogurt are known as ""yogurt cultures"". Fermentation of lactose by these bacteria produces lactic acid, which acts on milk protein to give yogurt its texture and its characteristic tang » Wikipedia.
From this point of view, yoghurt appears as an ideal support to begin an Igem project. In spite of adding synthetic flavours, we could modify bacteria to make them produce flavours directly in yoghurt. And what for dyes ? Already in yoghurt in too ! And why not adding drugs ? There are infinite possibilites. You will just need milk and modified bacteria to make a « SUPER YOGHURT ».

Multiagent System based modeling
Spatial simulation of a bacteria
We have also developed a spatial simulation of the basic flip-flop by considering the interaction between the different components in the interior of a bacterium using NetLogo. This kind of model allows to analyze some parameters not considered in the simulations based on the differential equations governing the concentrations of diverse elements, like the spatial (volumetric) variation of these concentrations. Moreover, we wanted to provide a friendly program that allows the researcher to study the influence of several parameters in the global behavior of the system.
About NETLOGO
NetLogo is a programmable modeling environment for simulating natural and social phenomena. It was authored by Uri Wilensky in 1999 and has been in continuous development ever since at the Center for Connected Learning and Computer-Based Modeling.
NetLogo is particularly well suited for modeling complex systems developing over time. Modelers can give instructions to hundreds or thousands of ""agents"" all operating independently. This makes it possible to explore the connection between the micro-level behavior of individuals and the macro-level patterns that emerge from the interaction of many individuals.
Simulating the bistable
To run the simulation you have to download the NetLogo environment from his web page and open after the file biestable-simulation.nlogo (download here )

Hong_Kong_HKUST,2017,Team:Hong Kong HKUST#Model#TimeControl_-_-_TEXT.html,"2 Non-Cooperativity Approximation
Because modelling the eﬀects of cooperativity of the two binding sites on pcI would add signiﬁcant complexity to the model, we decided to ignore it and simply treat the binding reactions as independent from each other. That is, the binding of cI to a site of pcI has the same rate regardless of whether the other site has a cI bound.
Thus, under this simpliﬁcation, the percentage of unbound pcI simply becomes the product of the unbound percentages of both types.
4 Simulations
To simulate the system, we implemented Euler’s method for approximating ordinary diﬀerential equations and applied the approximations as stated.
4.1 Control without Time Control
Fig. 1 Control setting where Cre is directly induced
As can be seen, from a high AHL concentration produced by the Sensing module, Cre saturates quite quickly and already reaches 80% of its maximal level at around 50 minutes.
Because we want to allow the Sensing module to reach suﬃciently high levels of AHL before activating the recombinase production, it is then necessary to add a Time Control module. As can be seen in the Sensing module simulation, it takes about 200 minutes to reach 80% of maximal AHL concentration levels.
4.2 Adding Time Control
Fig. 2 Time Delay response without AHL induction
Fig. 3 Time Delay response with AHL induction
Above is the simulation result of the Time Control module and a control where Cre is directly induced.
On the left, we have a simulation of the module without any initial AHL. As can be seen from the graph, the concentration of cI2 and Cre do not increase from 0 as desired, while the concentration of PhlF remains high, continuously repressing Cre. This shows that if the Sensing module does not produce AHL, then there will be no production of Cre as desired
On the right, the initial AHL is at the maximal level, and cI2 is constitutively produced. The concentration of cI2 increases quickly which then represses PhlF and causes its concentration to fall. When PhlF has a suﬃciently low concentration, Cre begins to be produced. Compared to the control without our Time Control module, the Cre takes about 150 minutes longer to reach 80% of maximum Cre levels. This should allow the Sensing module more time to produce AHL and aid in eﬃcient quorum sensing activation of surrounding cells.

Vilnius-Lithuania,2018,Team:Vilnius-Lithuania-OG#ProteinGAN_-_-_TEXT.html," The resulting dataset was relatively sparse for our purpose, therefore we decided to upsample using the NCBI RefSeq non-redundant protein database (nrDB). We used MMseqs2 (Steinegger et al. 2017) to cluster our selected enzyme database using 90% sequence identity threshold and over 80% sequence coverage, which resulted in a total of 77,686 representative sequences. This step was taken to reduce the redundancy of sequence database which was used as a query database for the MMseqs2 search workflow. To upsample, we searched our clustered database against nrDB using these parameters: 30% sequence identity threshold, 80% sequence coverage, 7.5 sensitivity level; and afterwards extracted 98% identity representatives. The resulting database consisted of 409900 sequences, which were used to assemble training and test sets for ProteinGAN.
Building the ProteinGAN
ProteinGAN - generative adversarial network architecture that we developed and optimized to generate de novo proteins. Once trained, it outputs a desirable amount of proteins with the confidence level of sequences belonging to a functional class it was trained for.
A Sub-neural network called discriminator learns how proteins look like by trying to distinguish between real and fake (generated) sequences. At the same time, another Sub-neural network called generator tries to fool it, by providing realistically looking generated protein sequences. Yet, the generator never actually sees any of the protein sequences.
Over time, generator becomes so good that generated examples satisfy rules by which discriminator currently judges proteins. In order to, keep up with generator, discriminator needs to discover more sophisticated patterns in real data to able to distinguish real from fake. In turn, the generator will adjust generation of sequences to match those patterns in order to stay in competition with the discriminator.
By the end of this competition, the generator will have learned how to generate proteins that share same patterns as real ones.
Figure 1: High-level design of ProteinGAN. Generator learns to create realistic sequence embeddings (digital sequence representations) from random noise, which then are compared to real sequence embedding by the Discriminator. The learning process of such a neural network is a never-ending competition between the Generator and Discriminator.
ProteinGAN results
Using the architecture described below, we have successfully trained a generative network to create enzyme sequences belonging to the DNA helicase class. After the training we asked the ProteinGAN to generate us a DNA helicase enzyme and that is what we got:

Human Practice
Contents
1 Exchange of Ideas with Fellow Scholars
2 Communication with Other Teams
3 Collaboration with Fellow Researchers
Human practice activities are integrated throughout the design and execution stages of our project. Interaction with the general public and scientific community led to many improvements in our design, such as the behavioral experiment, microinjection procedures and C. elegans mating method.
Exchange of Ideas with Fellow Scholars
For the viability of the behavioral experiment design, we held a seminar with behavioral psychology professor Peng Li of Shenzhen University to get some professional advice.
In the seminar, Prof. Li pointed out the lack of an indifferent stimulus on which we can build a new behavior. He also suggested building tropism on an indifferent factor by training worms with favorite or abhorrent stimulus. That was much easier than training worms to change their pre-existing likes and dislikes. The advice we got from Prof. Li helped us correct our principles and guided us to design our new behavioral experiment.
In such an interdisciplinary project, a smooth communication with experts of other fields can guarantee viability of our project and prevent ourselves from wasting time.
Communication with department of psychology and sociology SZU
Communication with Other Teams
During 26th,Aug and 28th,Aug this year, our team was invited to attend CCiC (Conference of China iGEMer Committee) in Fuzhou, China, to present our project among peers researchers.
All the 49 teams invited to the conference gave presentations and exhibited posters about their projects. During the conference, especially in the poster session, we had many opportunities to communicate with other teams and exchange ideas of our project designs.
Explaining our poster in the poster session in CCIC
After presenting our project on the conference, we had a short discussion with the judges, who provide us with much valuable advice. Judges raised concerns that the long-time training may   result in old C. elegans and additional uncertainties. Therefore, we adapted their suggestions  and modified our training pattern and related experiment designs"

Education & Awareness
Educating
Codonut-a game
We were fascinated by the concept of codon bias, which forms the basis for the modelling aspect of our project. We wondered if we could teach this concept with the help of a fun mobile game. We believe games can truly help people of all ages understand core concepts underlying day to day phenomena in a lasting way. This was how the game was born.
In the game, the player guides the ribosome character by tapping on the screen(thus lifting him up). The player must not hit the upper or lower bounds of the playing area(represented by the lipid bilayer). As an analogy to codon bias, we decided to use donuts, with ribosome preferring chocolate donuts above all others(who doesn't love chocolate?).  If you have yet to play the game,  you can download it on the App Store or Play Store . By the time of wiki freeze, our game has been downloaded by 91 people and reviewed by 24 people.
Teaching synthetic biology to high school students
Education with fun in Vana vani Matriculation school, chennai, Tamil Nadu, India To expand the synthetic biology community, we believed it’s necessary to create interest in the fundamental stage itself. We went to a school in our locality and interacted with our fellow student community in 12th grade. They all had their major as biology but still they were overwhelmed to know that they can engineer life!
We started with the very basic of DNA, as a source of information written in the language of cells which has only four letters and went to central dogma with proteins as meaning of the words created by those letters. Several analogies made by us like ‘RNA as a  photocopy of a particular page in a book’ made them understand well about the concepts. After this we went on to restriction enzymes which cut at palindromic sequences.
Activity: We made a simple activity to make them understand a palindromic sequence. A set of letters were given (say ‘AGACTT’) and the teams were asked to come up with as many palindromic sequences as they can with those letters. Many teams came up with many answers but actually one found out that it is just a simple math! With this we made sure that they understood the basics of complementary base pairing and reverse complementary matching of palindromic sequences.
Atlast the students were told what synthetic biologists are capable of and were asked to come up with some fun applications. We found our future IGEMers as their answers really amused us like glowing roadside trees"
UrbanTundra_Edmonton,2016,Team:UrbanTundra Edmonton#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," included presentations, prizes, and a panel of judges who all had experience judging teams at the Giant Jamboree. We achieved 2nd place among high school teams, with a $1000 dollar travel package, as well as “Most Initiative” and “Greatest Scientific Rigour” special awards. We even had the opportunity to sit one-on-one with each of the judges to discuss the details of project and ways to improve going into the Jamboree. We even made some new friends in the OLS_Canmore iGEM team, who will be presenting right after us at the Giant Jamboree!
University of Calgary
The University of Calgary team got us in contact with Robert Thirsk, former CSA astronaut. While interviewing him, they passed along our most pressing question regarding human practices. This provided us with a new perspective of the impacts of space development and where our project can fit into that. They were also the host school for AGEM, and we are very thankful to them for being awesome hosts!

Synergy: Putting it all Together
Incorporating Human Practices in the Design of our System
In the earlier stages of our project, we realized that in order to give our project the best chance of being implemented, we needed to do it in a way that was in line with both industry’s wants and needs.  To ensure that we did this, we established a dialogue with several experts in order to get their opinions on how we should approach our project.  This led to an informed design of our system, in which we emphasized the need for both physical and genetic containment devices.
Have we accomplished our goal?
Nearing the end of our project however, we wanted to see if we had accomplished what we set out to do.  So we decided to go back to the experts, this time taking the progress we had made on our project with us.  We got a variety of different perspectives from suggestions on the scale up of our project"
BU_Wellesley_Software,2011,Team:BU Wellesley Software#Notebook#CraigNotebook_-_-_TEXT.html," all permutations to be made.  Once we understand these algorithms, we can then place constraints on the problem, such as the number of invertases available.
Future Work
1.  Find multiple expensive invertase architectures and compare the pros and cons of these algorithms. - first week of July
2.  Place constraints on the problem and analyze how this affects our algorithms.  Determine the best way to help the user place a limited number of invertases. - half of second week in July
3.  Design a preliminary tool that automates the placement of these invertases and conveys this information to the user in the most intuitive way. - rest of second week and third week in July
4.  Optimize our algorithms - last week of July
Hopefully this information helps everyone else understand my plans and my part of the project.  I will be back from vacation next Saturday to pick up where I left off.  Of course, if I ever find myself bored down here, I may end up playing with these algorithms :p.
6/27/11
- Today the comp team went over to Wellesley to discuss the finer details of our collaboration this summer.  We decided that there were three main tools that we will build together.  The following is a list of these tools with a short description of each.  Note:  They are listed in order of which should be given the most attention this summer.
1. Digital Notebook
- This was AWESOME!  At a high level overview, this will be some app that runs on a touch screen device mounted in the wetlab.  It will allow users to work together much more efficiently and also will be a great digital recording of all the steps taken in the wetlab.
2. Invertase Designer
- The designer tool will let the user specify a set of parts and invetases that are available, as well as the permutations of these parts that they would like to use.  Then the tool will tell the user where invetases should be placed such that these part permutations can be made.  Under the hood it will use the algorithms I am currently working on.
3. Primer Designer
- I believe this may just become a simple Clotho tool that Jenhan develops.  It will function similarly to the other 1000 primer designers available.  If we get ambitious then maybe we will try to make the coolest primer designer possible, but this depends on how much time we have.

Collaboration with EpiphanyNYC
We collaborated with the nearby EpiphanyNYC team, located in Manhattan, New York City.
We sent EpiphanyNYC some DNA samples to quantify, since they have equipment we do not have access to that can accurately quantify the concentration of DNA. This will help validate our method for DNA quantification (a type of dot-blot technique using Ethidium Bromide) and test the standard curves we generated.
In return, we completed a survey for EpiphanyNYC on genetic safety."

bglX was capable of degrading the substrate MUG, which has a β(1→4) bond, similar to that of cellobiose.
We tested the ability of E. coli with this bglX part to grow on minimal media with cellobiose as the only carbon source. It could not. By contrast, it did grow if glucose was the carbon source, showing that it is fundamentally capable of growing on minimal media:
   
Cellobiose as the only carbon source. K523014 (bottom) fails to grow.

INP-EYFP
We made a fusion ( BBa_K523013 ) of Ice Nucleation Protein and Enhanced Yellow Fluorescent Protein, and placed it under the control of the Lac promoter.
Under blue light, the cells fluoresced yellow, as shown below (left image). Unfortunately, our imaging technology was not capable of showing whether the fluorescence was localised to the outer membrane, so we centrifuged the cells so that the membrane fraction was localised to the bottom of the tube and compared the result to a colony expressing EYFP without INP. This showed that the INP-EYFP was indeed localised to the cell membrane.

For screening the following wavelength settings were used: OD: 600 nm sfGFP: excitation: 480 nm emission: 508 nm mRFP1: excitation: 584 nm emission: 605 nm
Screening
As a prescreening setup an endpoint detection of OD and fluorescent intensities with a plate reader was chosen. Excitation and emission spectra of mRFP1 and sfGFP were obtained from a previously conducted measurement.
Thus a preselection of DMNBS tRNA/synthetase mutants was determined. A rescreening of mutants with promising effiency and fidelity was performed, to which an additional online measurement was made to obtain scattered light values as well as fluorescence intensities over time. This was carried out by an online measurement screening platform.
Analysis
The DMNBS synthetase variants were evaluated by normalizing GFP fluorescence levels to the wild type tyrosyl synthetase and comparing the mutants to each other. Thus incorporation efficiency and fidelity values were obtained.

Brainstorming
On this page is an overview of ideas that our team collected and did research on before we decided on the finalised project. You can see how some of our ideas were dropped altogether, whereas others set the theme for the Parasight project: speed of response, water sanitation, and detection of parasites.
The ideas
Water Sanitation
Quite early in the project the idea of water sanitation was put forward. We initially collected ideas about different substances, such as heavy metals, and pathogens we might be able to detect using relatively simple biosensors. In this list different parasites and bacteria were included.
Pathogen detection via quorum sensing
We later considered detecting the quorum sensing molecule N-acyl homoserine lactone produced by V. cholera for example. This molecule could than activate a simple colour output in our bacteria and thus exploit pathogen functions for detection. We later dropped this idea because, although it has a powerful application, it was too similar in design to biosensors that had been designed previously in iGEM projects. There were also a number of additional problems with this idea that made us not pursue it further.
Detection via receptors for bacteria-parasite interactions
A step further towards our final project was the idea to detect water borne parasites. Initially we did much research on parasite-bacteria interactions in order to find a sound mechanism we could implement in our system and link to an output. Even though we found some bacteria that interact with parasites, such as Salmonella with Schistosoma in the human gut, these we more often than not non-specific interactions and thus could give rise to false positive activations of our system.
Population control
This concept aimed to keep the total number of bacteria in equilibrium below the number they would naturally achieve, making the population number oscillate around this arbitrary threshold. This might be done by some clever use of quorum sensing systems acting on survival, growth or"

EGF
Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF) is a 6045 Da protein discovered by Stanley Cohen in 1986, which won him a Nobel Prize in Physiology and Medicine. EGF regulates cell proliferation by binding to the epidermal growth factor receptors (EGFRs) which are located on the cell surface. Upon binding of EGF to its receptor intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity is stimulated inducing a signaling cascade inside the cell which leads to increased calcium levels, glycolyisis and protein synthesis in the cell. This process ultimately leads to the proliferation of the cell. It was recently shown that c-Jun is one of the targets of EGF action. [46][47]
TNF-alpha
Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) is a cytokine involved the cells inflammatory response. TNF-alpha is a homotrimer that binds to one of its to receptors (TNF-R1/ TNF-R2) which then form a trimer themselves. Trimerization of the receptor induces a conformational change and the dissociation of the inhibitory protein SODD (Silencer of Death Domain protein) from the intracellular death domain of the receptor. The adaptor protein TRADD (TNF Receptor-associated Death Domain protein) can bind now to the death domain and allow other protein factors to bind aswell. The three main signaling pathways initiated in this way are: the NF-kB pathway, the MAPK opathway and the death signaling cascade. [60]
Pifithrin-α
Pifithrin-α (PFTα) is proposed to be a specific inhibitor of p53 signaling. It is not yet clear how exactly PFTα inhibits p53, but it seems to act at a stage after p53 translocation to the nucleus. Temporary suppression in vitro of p53 inhibits apoptosis induced by the damage to DNA and thus increases the fraction of cells surviving the stress. [61][62]
RNA-processing and transcriptional regulation
Post-transcriptional modification / mRNA processing in eukaryotes
To express a gene and successfully synthesize the appropriate protein the gene must firstly transcript into mRNA. Unlike in bacteria, this mRNA molecule is not directly ready for translation; the primary transcript is therefore called precursor-mRNA (pre-mRNA). One of the first modifications is a process referred to as 5’-capping. By means of several biochemical steps a 7-methylguanosine molecule is bound to the 5’ end of the pre-mRNA,"

Results and Discussion 
From a theoretical standpoint, it was worth investigating how different combinations of precursors may influence the resulting composition of the co-polymer product. The time plot generated from solving the ODE system with different initial parameters reveals as we hypothesized that with increasing available propionyl-CoA, the PHBV was predicted to have an increasing percentage of the PHV component. The initial concentrations of all enzymes were held at 0.1 μM and acetate at 1000 μM. For each run, the initial concentration of propionate was increased by 500 μM.
Among the main observations from the model results were that the resulting predicted molar ratios may be inaccurate and significantly discordant from the actual physiologically relevant amounts of PHBV found in microorganisms. Even in the case where 500 μM propionate and 1000 μM acetate was fed into the system, the occurrent molar ratio of PHV was as high as approximately 40%. This, however, was to be expected given the limited scope of the dynamic model. We decided to test other parameter alterations to see whether relative changes in behavior may be reflected concordantly with experimental data.
Assessing the effect of increasing propionate vs acetate substrate concentration on final PHBV composition
Given that one of our endeavors in the lab was to test how phaA and bktB β-ketothiolases performed relatively to one another in facilitating PHBV biosynthesis, we decided to investigate this by testing various combinations of parameters related to the concentrations of each enzyme. While phaA is the common enzyme found in C. necator used for PHB biosynthesis, it has been shown that commonly co-expressed bktB was superior in producing the PHV component of the co-polymer. However, we were interested to see whether bktB can fully replace phaA without compromising on the total yield of PHBV.
From what is seen from the surface plot (left) comparing the resulting PHBV total after 24 hours (at steady-state) from different concentrations of phaA and bktB, the dynamic model predicts that along higher levels of bktB there was an overall greater amount of PHBV produced. However, this does not reflect the actual case that occurs in microbes as PHV is not the majority component of PHA produced but rather PHB. Recalling the dubious results we observed from the aforementioned experiment where we tested different amounts of starting substrate"

(3) Anti-Oxidant Enzymes
A group of enzymes known as Antioxidants can have a preventative effect on radiation damage via reactive molecules. the reactive molecules reduce the antioxidant before having a chance to reduce DNA or sensitive proteins. Two examples are the Superoxide dismutase family (e.g., Manganese-SOD)and Catalase family (e.g., KatE), which react with Hydrogen Peroxide and Hydroxyl radical, respectively. Because the output of Superoxide dismutase is Hydroxyl radical, therefore only Superoxide dismutase combined with Catalase neutralizes Hydrogen Peroxide.

First meeting to garner interest and discuss potential projects.  We discussed the rule and timeline of the iGEM project. The consensus is that we will enter the Policy and Practices  track.  We decided to focus on the Glowing Plant – possibly by producing a risk assessment.
May 22, 2014
We formed three main working groups: 1) Risk Assessment (Jayce, Rene, Sophia, Jen, Ronnie, and Johanna), 2) Policy Brief (Jayce and Emily), 3) Public Opinion Engagement (Emily, Sophia, Rene, Ronnie, and Elizabeth). Then we set our next steps
1. collectively create outline
2. Discuss modeling techniques including systems mapping, concept mapping, mind mapping, influence diagrams, bazenet, and decision trees
3. Individuals need to register for the team on the iGEM website
a. team name is GES_NCSU_Raleigh_NC
b. Use the registration code given to register
Finally, we discussed individual team member interests and developed a list of questions to ask Antony Evans during our Skype conversation.

After finishing the brochure, we delivered the brochures to farmers who contacted us online though China. In brief, nearly 400 brochures were sent to twelve cities and counties in China, including Suzhou, Yanan, Yancheng, Jining, Guanzhou and so on.
Bio-safety
Questionnaire about laws on transgene and bio-safety
In order to know more about the opinions on transgene laws from iGEMers and students majoring in synthetic biology, we designed questionnaires and finished the survey. 177 students finished our questionnaire, most of whom were iGEMers or undergraduates and graduates majoring in biology. We found out that laws on bio-safety problems still need to be advertised, since a number of students were not familiar with them and thought it would be helpful to know more. Also, we provided some of the details in the laws, and majority students replied that they were useful to their study and research work.
Video about bio-safety in laborites
This year, UCAS iGEM team collaborated with other nine Chinese iGEM team, making a series of videos which focused on bio-safety to help Chinese students learn more about bio-safety. The topic of our team’s video is personal protective equipment, mainly concerns about the proper use of gloves, lab coat etc in laborites. Here comes our video.

Intro: Pondered how to express cage in iGEM compatible vector. Designed and ordered appropriate primers.
Vinson had a plasmid that contains: T7 promoter-RBS-iGEM suffix. After much thought, I designed primers to amplify our g block with the iGEM prefix, and tack on a his tag, stop codon, and the suffix in two rounds of PCR. The forward primer will be the iGEM prefix and the first 20 nucleotides of the cage sequence. The first reverse primer will be the last 20 nucleotides of the cage and the his tag. The second reverse primer will inclund the final nucleotide of the cage, his tag, stop codin and suffix. This two step addition was the only way to add the his tag and stop codon without going over the 60bp limit imposed by IDT for ordering oligos. Sri said to express the cage in this new iGEM compatible vector, as well as the pET-22b vector in parallel, just to see which is better. He recommended that we initially transform the ligated plasmids into DHSalpha competent cells (in his lab) to verify correct plasmids before finally transforming them into BL21-DE3 competent cells for protein expression.

PmerT is a promoter from Tn21 mercury resistance (mer) operon. Transposon 21 itself is carried by plasmid NR1 (Nakaya, Nakamura et al. 1960), which was originally isolated from Shigella flexneri in Japan in the late 1950s (Liebert, Hall et al. 1999).
The regulatory region of mer operon consists of two tightly overlapped, divergently oriented promoters – PR and PTPCAD.(Park, Wireman et al. 1992). PR is the promoter of the regulatory protein gene, merR, and PTPCAD is for the transcription of the structure gene – merPTCAD. Both of them are called merOP as a whole. MerR always binds to merOP as a homodimer and enhances the occupancy of PTPCAD by RNA polymerase regardless of the presence of Hg(II), although only"

Conclusion and discussion
Sequencing results showed a point mutation in both the part by the iGEM team of Freiburg 2010 and the Slovenian part of 2012. The mutation led to a PstI restriction site, that complicated cloning according to iGEM standards. After a site-directed mutagenesis (Quickchange) the restriction site was removed and the sequence hence repaired.
Quantitative analysis by mRNA measuring of Poly-A-sequence addition showed 4.6-fold higher mRNA stability in comparison to the non-Poly-A-construct.
Kill-Switch induction turned out to be difficult when using the prodrug famciclovir. Although HEK293T cells are known to produce aldehyde oxidase [19] and xanthine oxidase [20] the conversion of famciclovir into its active form penciclovir seems not to proceed effectively enough in HEK293T cells in order to be detectable by fluorescence microscopy. Concerning incubation time and drug concentration, we have indeed used up to a 10-fold higher concentration (3110 µM) than for instance Qiu et al. (311 µM) or iGEM-Slovenia 2012 (392 µM) and almost the same as iGEM-Freiburg 2010 (4850 µM). Nevertheless, the assumed effect was almost not observable, which shows that in the case of HEK293T cells famciclovir is not well suited for acting as an inducing drug for the GMK-TK30 Kill-Switch. Therefore, we recommend for in vitro studies to use either ganciclovir or penciclovir, the latter known to be less effective in vitro at least on rat Sertoli cells [21] . Finally, we can only assume that the reason for the weakness of famciclovir as an inducer of apoptosis may be due to its complex metabolism. The advantages of famciclovir lie rather in its high bioavailability after oral administration.

Conclusion
Thinking ahead, the possibilities of creating new organisms through manipulation, reduction and modularization leads to man as a kind of ""Creator"". This opens up new ethical, social and philosophical areas of conflict. In this article the problem arising from the use of terms like ""living machines"" and ""synthetic / artifical cell"" were highlighted.
Particularly problematic is in our eyes, that there are several types of interpretation.
A science which has the possibility to improve the lives of people with new, low-cost and effective methods of environmental protection, the treatment of diseases and many other areas, should provide an unambiguous basis for an informed discussion. The fact that terms imply false and failing to reach full potential scenarios, prevents a qualified debate on opportunities and risks in this field. An example of this can be seen in the genetechnology debate, in which, through ignorance of the topic often irrational fears are raised which prevents a professional informed debate on this matter.
It is crucial to apply a definition, which is without ambiguity and reflects real possibilities and boundaries of this field. A proposal for a solution could be ""mechanical living organism"", through which the problem of the misleading hybrid character of terms is dissolving.

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html," with extra xanthine supply.
Increase of uric acid production by over-expressing key enzymes in de novo purine biosynthesis pathway.
Expressing XOR in E. coli
We constructed the plasmid bearing recombinant human xanthine oxidoreductase (rhXOR, shorted as XOR) on a pETDuet-1 vector and transformed it into E. coli, thus obtaining E. coliXOR. We first cultured E. coliXOR in regular LB medium at 37℃ at 200 rpm for 12-16 hours, then added IPTG to induce expression of XOR and cultured at 30℃ at 200 rpm overnight. Then XOR activity was tested by incubating bacteria with OD600 of 100 with xanthine for 6 hours at 1100 rpm and detecting uric acid with HPLC-MS (for detailed assay, see NOTEBOOK ). In regular LB medium, no uric acid production was detected (Figure 7).
Since uric acid is reported to cause cell death, we speculated that expression of XOR in large quantity was baneful and thus expression was suppressed. Therefore, we removed IPTG and counted on leakage expression of XOR. XOR activity was tested following the same procedure, but still no uric acid production was detected (figure 8).
When we learnt that XOR contains molybdopterin cofactors as active catalytic site, we added 1mM sodium molybdate into regular LB medium and cultured E. coliXOR under same conditions as before. IPTG was added in experiment group while removed in control group. We used HPLC-MS to detect uric acid and integrated area was calculated and compared to decide the relative amount of uric acid. Since peaks of xanthine and uric acid were sometimes overlapped in UV absorbance plot (Figure 9), we integrated the MS plot. Results showed that compared to bacteria not bearing XOR (Control in Figure 10), E. coliXOR cultured with 1mM sodium had the exceptional ability to transfer external xanthine into uric acid. The function of IPTG differed regarding plasmid vectors. Control bacteria bore a pETDuet-1 plasmid same as pET-XOR, and gained resistance to ampicillin, while RSF-XOR bore a pRSFDuet-1 plasmid and was endowed a resistance to kanamycin. In pET-XOR bearing bacteria, addition of IPTG significantly inhibited its ability to oxidize xanthine, while in pRSF-XOR bearing"

Our Team and Mr. Roespel at the right
Our team in front of the German ""Bundestag"".
Statement of the German government
In Germany synthetic biology is considered as a new field of research in the biotechnology. It is based on biotechnology and genetic engineering and has the aim to generate new biological systems with accurately defined abilities.
In the near future, the resulting knowledge will be used in various research sectors such as biofuel or pharmaceutics. In spite of the possible potential of this field of research more and more people warn against potential risk of misusing of this new knowledge.
On this account, it is necessary to take care of this new technique in a social and political way, so that it would be possible to use the enormous prospects and potentials and to assess the possible risks of misusing.  In this context, the German parliament required the government for a statement on this topic.
In response to the German parliament question on the position of the German government to “perspective and position of the government of synthetic biology”, the German government gave a statement to this topic :
(cited from “Antwort der Bundesregierung auf die Kleine Anfrage der Abgeordneten René Röspel, Dr. Ernst Dieter Rossmann, Dr. Hans-Peter Bartels, weiterer Abgeordneter und der Fraktion der SPD – Drucksache 17/4898 – Stand und Perspektiven der Synthetischen Biologie“, 22.03.2011, translated by iGEM-Team Potsdam)
The government’s expectations of this new field of research primarily relate to the benefit of environmental protection, energy research, development of new chemical products and renewals in biomedical science and pharmaceutical industry. However, the synthetic biology is still in its infancy. For this reason, it is not possible to evaluate the date when the first renewals will be established.
The military research in the field in relation to the protection against infectious agents will not be excluded in the future. However the risks which are associated with the abuse of this technology for terrorist acts were classified as low, because of the existence of naturally occurring pathogen. The research and development work in the area of synthetic biology is subject to the gene technology law, the foreign trade law and the weapons of war control law, wherefore there are no additional need for legislative or regulatory action.
The government monitored the opinion-form"

Ideally, we would like to remove NPs from all systems, so we visited two different types of WWTPs: a local urban facility in Dihua, Taipei, and a smaller rural facility in Boswell, Pennsylvania. We found that wastewater in the two plants is treated using very similar processes (figures 5-2 and 5-3). We also contacted Thomas J. Brown, the Water Program Specialist of the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection, and asked him if there were differences between rural and urban plants that we should consider when thinking about implementing our project. He responded, “[t]he heart of the treatment process is the biological process used for treatment; the biology remains the same regardless of facility size.” Thus, in both types of WWTPs, we want to apply our engineered bacteria in the Secondary Treatment step—either in aeration tanks or in the sedimentation tank.

Biosafety
We used a safe and common lab strain of E. coli, K-12, as our chassis (Environmental Protection Agency 1977). In both approaches, our constructs do not express proteins associated with virulence: PR is a transmembrane protein that commonly exists in marine bacteria, and for biofilm production we were careful to avoid known virulence factors such as alpha hemolysins (Fattahi et al. 2015). Most importantly, biosafety is built into WWTPs. Before treated effluent is released back into the environment, it must go through a final disinfection step, where chlorine, ozone, or UV radiation are used to kill microbes still present in the wastewater (Pescod 1992).
PR CONSIDERATIONS
During our visit to Dihua WWTP, the chief engineer informed us that they use the activated sludge process, which uses aerobic microbes to digest organic matter in aeration tanks. The steady influx and mixing of air provide oxygen favorable to aerobic microbes; the turbulent water also increases the probability of PR binding to citrate-capped NPs (CC-NPs). Thus, we envision directly adding PR E. coli into existing aeration tanks. In addition, as part of the activated sludge process, WWTPs regularly cycle microbe-rich sludge back into aeration tanks to maintain the microbial"

Why iGEM?
I got involved in iGEM as I just could not let this opportunity go to waste. The ability to work in a team on a project of our own design is an experience not many get the chance to pursue. iGEM gives participants the chance to see and explore research not otherwise taught during a standard degree and how the inner workings of a research project is undertaken.
Future career ideas
Whilst still being on the fence about continuing my education and studying for a Phd after I graduate, I would like to work in the field of understanding and developing treatments for neurodegenerative disease.
Interests/Hobbies
I have played cricket for the vast majority of my life and is my bread and butter. I also dabble in the art of juggling. Also I have a keen interest in social and behavioural psychology as a side interest to biochemistry.

The iGEM competition appealed to me as it allowed us to design our own project and work within a team to achieve our aims.  I wanted to get some experience working in a lab and learning the techniques used in synthetic biology as well as developing skills in communicating science to a wide variety of people.
Future career ideas
After completing my degree in Biomedicine I would like to work in a Research lab, specialising in Biochemistry.
Interests/Hobbies
I enjoy playing sports such as football and hockey and have been dancing for 15 years.  I have also completed my Gold Duke of Edinburgh’s award which I really enjoyed doing.

As students of Bio Engineering, to serve humanity in the medical field strike us at the drop of  a hat. In our project we optimize the detection of Cancer in a hand held  minimally invasive chip with an immobilized DNA that is complementary to MALAT 1 and  a biomarker called Biodipy.
PROJECT MOTIVATION:
When we conducted a survey on Cancer we were shocked that 80% of people in rural areas  think that cancer detection and cure, costs an arm and a leg. This motivated us to develop a  device that can detect cancer accurately and at the same time cost effective. Our personal  contact with the Cancer Institute gave us the necessary boost up to materialise our idea.
BACKGROUND:
MALAT 1 gene produces a precursor transcript from which a long non-coding RNA is  derived by RNase P cleavage of a tRNA-like small ncRNA (known as mascRNA) from its 3' end. The resultant mature transcript lacks a canonical poly (A) tail but is instead stabilized by  a 3' triple helical structure. This transcript is retained in the nucleus where it is thought to  form molecular scaffolds for ribonucleoprotein complexes. It may act as a transcriptional  regulator for numerous genes, including some genes involved in cancer metastasis and cell  migration, and it is involved in cell cycle regulation. Its upregulation in multiple cancerous  tissues has been associated with the proliferation and metastasis of tumor cells.
HOW DID WE DO IT?
We designed a microfluidic chip using PDMS material which contains complementary DNA of 22 base pairs and a fluoromarker called Biodipy. The MALAT 1 amplified using E.Coli is fed into the channels of the chip which produces fluorescence whose intensity is proportional to cancer stages. We developed an algorithm for the intensity range for different stages of cancer.

Conclusion: Red-light activation of the optogenetic toggle switch was demonstrated. As shown in Figures 1 and 2, a significantly difference can be observed between plants irradiated with red light and in dark conditions. As can be seen in Figure 2, plants irradiated with white light show a peculiar luciferase activation due to white light contains the red and far-red wavelength.
VIRAL VECTOR TRANSPORT
Up to this point, we have demonstrated the ability to control plant endogenous’ expression profile using a modular and standard red/far-red switch in order to reach all users’ necessities. However, since this circuit will be located on the roots propagating the signal from there to the rest of the plant, and many proteins are not able to move itself to other parts of the plant, we resolved to use a viral vector transport strategy.
The feasibility of Potato Virus X (PVX) as a viral vector with systemic movement was tested using the following experimental design . Thus, Agrobacterium tumefaciens culture carrying a genetic construct with a DsRED (red fluorescent protein) transcriptional unit (TUs) was agroinfiltrated  in N. benthamiana roots, leaves and lower part of the stem. After two weeks, in all treatments, the fluorescent protein could be observed in meristems, buds, new and old leaves and even flowers.
Figure 3. a) Fluorescent images produced by the infection of the stem with an Agrobacterium tumefaciens carrying a PVX with DsRED. b) and c) Fluorescence signal images showing were the infection of the buds with A. tumefaciens carrying a PVX with DsRED. d) Pictures were taken from the leaf of the plant after the infection with PVX with DsRED by A. tumefaciens.
Conclusion: Therefore, as shown in Figure 2, PVX arises as a suitable approach for transporting proteins from roots to the aerial part of the plant due to its speed and yield. It has not escape to our attention the possible reversibility of viral infections as some of the evidence collected may suggest. This would allow plant to return its original state after a certain period of time (i.e. resetting the system) (Fig.4).
Figure 4. Fluorescent pattern shows an abundant protein concentration at the base of the leaf whereas in the leaf tip, there seems to be any fluorescent signal.
However, viral vector strategy underlies some drawbacks. Thus, usage of mRNAs as long-distance signalling molecules postulates as a good"

The ‘erosion of trust’ toward science and technology has manifested itself through the disintegration of this fixed and self-perpetuating institutional set-up. As a result, producing and making use of the acquired knowledge, as well as the expert authority that came with it, had to be shared now with opposing expert voices. A new heterogeneity started to emerge in scientific knowledge production where public trust in the authority of expert knowledge was no longer unconditional (Barry 2007: 246-247). Moreover, when it comes to the environmental risks of genetic engineering, experts are increasingly confronted with the difficulty and uneasiness of communicating the constraints of scientific practice and the limits of knowledge when attempting to address and mitigate the controversy. Social convention dictates that their expertise would be required to address factual matters which are sometimes impossible to answer from the available scientific evidence. Nevertheless, the concerns and questions conveyed by the lay public remain legitimate political questions. Consequently, the ‘transscientific’ questions, as van den Daele (1999) characterizes them, help to demarcate between acquired knowledge and what lies beyond (van den Daele 1999: 69-70).
In the case of synthetic biology as a discipline, environmental movements can come forward easily to counter the discourse of technological optimism and expert authority that the community of synthetic biologists might have. The reason for this is that an apparent kinship exists with a similar controversy surrounding genetic modification (GM). Despite that is sometimes described as ‘extreme genetic engineering’, ‘genetic engineering on steroids’ (Friends of the Earth et al. 2012: 2; Voosen 2013), or captioned with the notion of ‘creating’ or ‘tinkering with’ life (Kera 2014: 28; Torgersen and Hampel 2012: 143), synthetic biology however has not yet been the subject of widespread public debate similar to the heavily deprecated GM crops antecedent. This is because the existence of synthetic biology is still largely considered to be uncommon knowledge among the wider public. Yet, based on the current environmentalist attitude towards GM crops, future efforts of synthetic biology may become prone to similar displays of distrust (Pauwels 2013; Torgersen and Hampel 2012). Besides the intrinsic scientific uncertainty, the governance challenges of synthetic biology exhibit a considerable degree of what Zhang et al. (2011) call ‘cross-borderness’. This cross-borderness as governance strategy entails not only bridging nations through transnational action, but most of all, bridging"

We redesigned the part sequence provided by iGEM16_Washington. We deleted irrelevant bases on the two ends of this promoter and retained the core sequence. In this way, this promoter played its key role with less bases.
Strains of S. cerevisiae BY4742 containing either BBa_K2165004-yEmRFP and BBa_K2407000-yEmRFP with an initial OD600 of 0.1 were grown for 24 hours in SC-URA medium at 30 degrees Celsius, and then were induced with 0.1 mM Cu2+. Samples were tested with fluorescent microplate reader after 1, 3, 6, 12, and 24 hours.

From the result we got. The expression of yEmRFP in yeast with the two promoters were very similar. We could speculate that the core function and sequence hasn’t been damaged during our redesign.
Error-Prone PCR
In our experiment, we noticed that CUP1 promoter still has a certain degree of leakage expression. To make a better biosensor, we planned to reduce the leakage expression and increase the sensitivity. To reach this goal, we took the fluorescence intensity at both induction or not into evaluation indexes.
The technology of error-prone PCR was taken into our experiment. Although there are many methods to introduce genetic diversity into a parent sequence, error-prone PCR is the most common way of creating a combinatorial library based on a single sequence. By adding some heavy metal ions into the PCR buffer and preparing dNTPs with different composition, new mutants were introduced into CUP1 promoter.

1. Introduction
In designing new circuits and implementing them, it is important to model the effect of it on the bacteria: how sensitive is the system, how much will it produce and will it affect the growth? These questions can be answerred in the internal model. We will use two approaches. Flux Balance Analysis (FBA) will study the steady-state values for production and growth rate, while  Simbiology will study the sensitivity and dynamic processes in the cell.
2. Simbiology
In the next section we will describe our Simbiology model. Simbiology allows us to calculate systems of ODE's and to visualize them in a nice diagram. It also has options to make scans for different parameters which allows us to study the effect of the specified parameter. We will focus on the production of leucine, Ag43 and AHL in cell A and the changing behavior of cell B due to changing AHL concentration. In this perspective, we will make two models in Simbiology: one for cell A and cell B.
2.1 Cell A
The designed circuit in Cell A is under control of a temperature sensitive cI repressor. Upon raising the temperature, cI will dissociate from the promoter and the circuit is activated. This leads to the initiation of the production of LuxR and LuxI. LuxI will consecutively produce AHL, which binds with LuxR. The newly formed complex will then activate the production of Leucine and Ag43. Leucine and AHL are also able to diffuse out of the cell into the medium. Ag43 is the adhesine which aids the aggregation of cells A, while Leucine and AHL are necessary to repel cells B.
We can extract the following ODE's from this circuit (the used functions will be explained later on):
${\alpha}$:transcription term, ${\beta}$:translation term, ${d}$:degradation term, ${D}$:diffusion term ${K_d}$:dissociation constant, ${n}$:hill coefficient, ${L}$:leak term       $$\frac{{\large d} m_{cI}}{d t} = \alpha_1 {\cdot} cI_{gene} - d_{mCI} {\cdot} m_{cI}$$      $$\frac{{"

DIYbio, iGEM and the Registry of Parts
As we started working on the ""Public BioBrick"" we became increasingly interested in the relationship between DIYbio and the Registry of Parts. Currently, only licensed academic labs that host an iGEM team have access to the Registry. We define ""access"" as the ability to get and contribute physical DNA and add experience data.
In 2009, iGEM briefly allowed DIYbio groups to register for the competition, but this was quickly stopped after two months. Meagan Lizaro explained to us that this was due to safety concerns with non-regulated groups and because it was explicitly forbidden by MIT.

The only bad observed was observed in lane 10, which (I think?) corresponds to the control, pSB1AK3. The lack of any product whatsoever in the other lanes is a disturbing development, as it indicates the failure of the VF2 and VR primers to bind to sites in what is expected to be the pSB1K3 plasmid, or that the plasmid is missing entirely. The fact that all 10 samples are missing bands indicates the problem is likely inherent in the part itself and not due to random lab work error.
⇒ This will be investigated by means of manual overnight cultures. Ligations L1-2 and L1-7 were suspended in 2mL LB+Kan and left to grow. Colonies from plate L1 were chosen for ratio reasons, as the 1:1 plasmid-insert ratio is less likely to have bizzare ligation anomalies.

⇒ Overnight cultures were purified using a miniprep kit. A 50µL digestion was prepared containing L1-2, L1-7, and the remains of the two stock parts (pSB1K3 and J04500) as controls. The digestion proceeded as follows:
∴ 32.5µL diH2O
∴ 5µL Buffer
∴ 0.5µL BSA
∴ 10µL DNA solution
∴ 1µL EcoRI and PstI
Incubated at 37°C for 2 hours, then heat inactivated at 80°C for 20 minutes.
⇒ Solutions were first run on a 2% gel to catch and compare the insert, J04500, with the stock parts:
The gel concentration was too high to resolve the plasmids' size. Otherwise, it appears the insert is of correct length.
⇒ Solutions were then run on a separate 1% gel to resolve the plasmid backbones' length:
It is easy to resolve the length of the backbone at around 2200bp here. It is unknown as to why the PCR reaction failed previously, but from this assessment the part appears to now be in the proper backbone.
⇒ The PCR reaction was attempted a second time, this time with stocks of purified ligations. The protocol run was identical to the previous reaction. The gel appears as follows:

The user only needs to fix our equipment on a buoy or a platform, and to purify the water when receiving the text message that the device automatically sends to him/her.
Demand
As we have demonstrated, excessive ammonia in the fish pond is one of the main problems that limited the development of fresh water aquaculture. Excessive ammonia will lead to the deterioration of water quality and effect the taste of the fish. It will also lead to the outbreak of fish diseases and cause fish death, heavily decreasing the yield of the fish pond. If we cannot solve the problem of excessive ammonia, it will be problematic to increase the breeding density and to improve the fish quality, thus effecting the income of fish farmers.
So essential as the problem of excessive ammonia is, there are certain solutions fish farmers will apply empirically. During the high-risk period, fish farmers will frequently visit their ponds and observe the water quality and fish conditions. Once there is any manifestation indicting excessive ammonia or fish diseases, they will take emergency measures such as disinfecting the pond and changing pond water.
Given the fact that fish farmers are judging by virtue of experience, there will always be deviation. When any manifestation occurs, excessive ammonia has actually erupted already. Although there are some products of ammonia detection on the market, they are either too expensive for fish farmers to afford or inconvenient to use (See more details on products comparison in entrepreneurship ). In addition, they measures they usually take to deal with excessive ammonia are either too expensive or too troublesome. According to our research (See more details on Integrated HP), big aquaculture companies usually choose running water to breed fish, which, in places lack of surface water, will cost up to 200 thousand yuan per month and waste thousands tons of underground water. Self-employed fish pond tend to choose chemical agents to remove ammonia, but this method is not efficient enough and is not eco-friendly.
Therefore, an effective, convenient and cheap way to detect and degrade ammonia is in strong demand of fish farmers.
Design
Based on the principle of efficiency, convenience and economy, we designed a device to detect the ammonia concentration in the fish pond with the application of our engineered bacteria and introduced another strain of engineered E. coli to covert ammonia in the pond water to nitrogen or uric acid precipitation.
By introducing bacteria into the sensing system can reduce the cost of detection components. Our engineered bacteria will express RFP when the ammonia concentration is below the threshold. When the ammonia concentration exceeds the safe value, our bacteria will stop expressing RFP"
Alberta,2012,Team:Alberta#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," only pale pink was observed. The colour was only slightly improved in the presence of 1.0 mM IPTG! A closer look at the literature showed that most people interested in repressor-type regulation, place the repressor as a single copy on the E. coli chromosome [Lutz and Bujard (1997), Sidney et. al (2007)]. Since pSB1C3 is a high-copy plasmid we hypothesized that the concentration of LacI in the cell was too high for efficient induction. We therefore devised an easy strategy to weaken the LacI promoter. The Anderson promoters have two restriction sites between the promoter regions (AvrII and NheI) which we preserved in our promoter designs. Since NheI is unique in our construct, we filled the site in with DNA poymerase. The 4-bp addition that results, increases the separation between the -10 and -35 regions from the preferred 17-bp to the highly unfavoured 21bp separation [Brunner and Bujard (1987), Hawley and McClure (1983)]. In short, the promoter would be flying on only one wing. When we examined colour expression in the modified construct the results in the presence and absence of IPTG were much more noticable. We further characterized our constructs, which we call weak lacI and strong LacI, by measuring the fluorescence of RFP in overnight cultures as a function of IPTG concentration. The results are presented below.
One potential problem that we became aware of through these experiments is that the range of colour intensity observed in the presence and absence of the inducer is much different between liquid cultures and plates. When cells containing the weak lacI construct are streaked onto plates, the contrast is significantly reduced. In the absence of IPTG, pink develops over longer times of incubation so that there is only a narrow window for observing white and red. This was a little worrisome since our plan of controlling colours spatially would be based on the colour development of bacterial “lawns” on plates.
                       
Fig 2. Dynamics of colour expression. Panel A. Schematic of the controllable colour cassette used in these experiments. RFP and LacI are contained on the same plasmid as shown. LacI is constitutively expressed from a very weak promoter (described below) or an intermediate strength promoter (Pr-3). It controls RFP by binding to its operator positioned between the RFP promoter elements. The expression of RFP is induced by the inactivation of LacI in the presence of IPT"

Aim The aims of the RP-HPLC validation runs are to evaluate the available RP-HPLC system in the Linnaeusborg, to discover the retention time of styrene, to test if styrene elutes at all, to optimize the available parameters of the RP-HPLC for optimal measurement, to validate the sample preparation and to come up with a standardizeable procedure that can be employed for qualitative styrene analysis for the rest of the project
The shimadzu HPLC system was equipped with a C18 column and with water plus 0 - 100 % acetonitrile as gradient mobile phase. Two runs were done. For the first run 0,1 molar styrene in ethyl acetate solution was injected to find out the retention time and test the Diode Array Detector.
For the second run 0,5 ml ethylacetate, 0,5 ml lysed yeast cell culture and a drop 20 µl styrene were vortexed for 15 minutes. The apolar phase was then filtered over a 0,22 nm nylon membrane and injected into the HPLC system.
The styrene only eluted at a high percentage of acetonitrile as is expected, looking at the log P of 2,7. Therefore another gradient mobile phase was chosen: water with methanol 0 - 100 %. As styrene eluted at a composition of 50 % water 50 % methanol it was chosen to validate a method with a gradient of 30 - 100 % methanol. The retention time of styrene in this run was 17,5 minutes. The UV spectrum recorded at this point in time confirms that styrene is what elutes from the column.

As is shown in the graph, this system can be reasonably considered as a TCS. The amount of NtrC-Pi (Conc) and NtrB-Pi (Conb) are two key parameters of this system. Four factors influence Conc and Conb: NtrB helps NtrC’s phosphorylation, NtrC starts the production of NtrB, Conb reduction caused by PII and constant NtrC production. Also, it should not be neglected that the inherent degradation of NtrC and Ntrb is in proportion to their own concentration.
Thus, the evolution equation of this system can be written as:
Where y0 can be expressed as:
The four parameters b, c, y0, x0 invited here respectively represent the velocity of the four processes mentioned before. To be emphasized,y0 describing the change of Conb caused by PII. Parameters a, d is the coefficient of proportionality between Conc or Conb and its depredating velocity. This is a differential equation and the evolution process could be treated as a Markov Process*.
Here we apply methods from dynamic system to conduct further analysis:
First, Consider evolution matrix A, calculate the eigenvalue λ of A
Solve this equation, get
and the eigenvector is
Since parameters a, d are relatively small compared with c, b and they are both negative, it can be easily spotted thatλ1>0,λ2<0 and the ordinate of the vector I1>0 while that of I2<0. If we temporarily put aside the parameters x0, y0 and the definition domain of Conc and Conb, this system could be explained and predicted by the phase flow graph shows below.
Every curve in the graph is an orbit of the system with different initial Conc and Conb. This means that the system with certain initial condition evolves alongside the curve that passes through that point. Thus, with any certain set of parameters, we can determine how the system evolves according to the graph.
So how to draw this graph? How to calculate the function of the curves in the graph? If we consider a system with the evolving law written as
Rewrite r(t) using the eigenvector I1, I2, defined vector X=(Conc, Conb)
Take this back into the differential equation, after simplify, get
Solve this set of equation,"
ArtScienceBangalore,2010,Team:ArtScienceBangalore#NoteBook_-_-_TEXT.html,". In the demons' world-view, they should be on top and the gods naturally feel that the world is at rights when they are in control. The world exists around this constant shifting system, one can only exist with the other. How does this relate to synbio?
Dharma is another integral concept to Indian religions and philosophy. It is about duty, and morality. But contrary to western ideas, one's duty is always relative, contextual. Arshia explained, ""I am a wife, I am a friend, I am a teacher. Tonight, I am here as a teacher, this is my duty. I have other duties, but my decision to be here teaching you tonight is about my relation to the world as teacher."" One's position in the world is defined in terms of relations and roles, context, not in absolute terms of self or not-self; this is integral to traditional 'Indian' ideas of self.
If ""a myth is a lie that tells the truth"", then what kinds of myths is synbio telling us, and what kinds of stories should we be telling about the science's ideology?
We talked about hybrids, a recurring theme in mythology. From playwright Girish Karnad's retelling of story of the woman who swapped her best friend's and husband's heads and bodies (which ended in disaster), to the half-horse, half-human trope that recurs around the world. Synbio, is of course, about hybrids. But other words and language are common to the world of literary story-telling and scientific story-telling, like transformation. Nothing in Indian myth is born, normally it's all construction or ten thousand pieces in jars and bits of wood.
Arshia reading from Girish Karnad's play
Science is a way of telling a story. We talked more about this, questioning science's inability to tell stories about itself. Is our work to tell stories about science because it can't reflect on itself? In the arts, it is about being present in your work, whereas in science, it is about being absent. In design, do we also try to make ourselves absent? Why do some artists purposefully use groups to represent themselves in the scientific discourse - like Critical Art Ensemble or Rich Pell's Center for Post-Natural History ?
Indian narratives have a framing - each 'scene' is a frame for another story - as you are walking on a great journey, something along the way reminds you of another story that gets told. What it the frame in Synthetic Biology? Arshia controversially said, ""I don't think scientists should be given the use of metaphor - just like"

Sample 1 is not representative at 8 hours since the remaining volume of bacteria was less than the volume in the cuvette. Therefore this sample was diluted which resulted in a increased intensity as the cuvette was now fully filled, however, the measurement did not reach its full potential.
The Cu-promoter::RFP // Custom receptor sample washed ( 13/10/18 ) and incubated overnight was split up in two 4 ml fractions. To one fraction 40 μl  50 mM Aspartic acid was added and incubated for 4 hours.  After 4 hours 500 μl was used for fluorescence measurements, this was repeated at 8 and 11 hours
Although these data are not conclusive it indicates that the custom receptor has a reaction on the addition of aspartate. Therefore new samples were inoculated in 5 ml LB.

Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web in 1989, about 20 years after the first connection was established over what is today known as the Internet. At the time, Tim was a software engineer at CERN, the large particle physics laboratory near Geneva. Many scientists participated in experiments at CERN for extended periods of time, then returned to their laboratories around the world. These scientists were eager to exchange data and results, but had difficulties doing so. Tim understood the unrealized potential of millions of computers connected together through the Internet.
