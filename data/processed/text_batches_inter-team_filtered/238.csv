Technion-Israel,2014,Team:Technion-Israel#Experiments_-_-_TEXT.html," 0.1 µM AHL. At higher concentrations of AHL, saturation in the GFP expression can be seen.
The experiment results showed that a relative high GFP fluorescence was received without IPTG induction, an indication for the leakiness of the Plac promoter. A higher GFP expression was seen with the IPTG induction, as expected.
Future work
Although the results of the experiment were successful, there are points need to be checked in order to improve the gate and the whole system function:
1. Checking gate 2 in combination with gate 1 of the alpha system. In this case, gate 1 will hopefully be the AHL source and external AHL source won't be needed.
2. Trying to change the promoter of gate 2 to a less leaky one.

Although it was expected to be seen differently than the control, unfortunately both of the cultures, control and experiment, were negative.
The O.D. was as follows (after the O/N growth):
Experiment ;(LB+CM+Kan+IPTG) ; O.D.600nm:0.14
Control ; (LB+CM+Kan) ; O.D.600nm:0.08
Pic 1: Control LB after O/N incubation
Pic 2: Experiment LB after O/N incubation (with IPTG)
As for the plates, all of the 4 plates (2 cultures each 100ul and rest) were blank; no colonies grew after O/N incubation.
Pic 3: Control plate (CM+Kan) 100ul
Pic 4: Experiment plate (CM+Kan+IPTG) 100ul
Pic 5: Control plate (CM+Kan) rest
Pic 6: Experiment plate (CM+Kan+IPTG) rest
In the future we will need to test different designs of the splint, maybe different lengths.
Another thing we can try (and probably do so before the Jamboree) is to use a variety of concentrations of CM and look for resistance in lower concentrations. Also we plan on titrating the CM after the incubation with our strain and compare it to a non CM resistance strain, to see if there is any degradation of the CM by the bacteria.

Heidelberg,2015,Team:Heidelberg#Sandbox_-_-_TEXT.html," to it. Lucky catch!
With fresh ideas we headed back to the lab and continued our experiments, being envious of all the people that could continue to sleep in the sun.
We’ve been lucky and actually met someone knowledgable in arts. Her name is Nati and she studies the history of art in Berlin.
Panel Discussion
Synthetic biology - engineering life with its most fundamental units by using DNA BioBricks and other modularly combinable parts, has a potential beyond scope and can improve the quality of life for everyone and mankind as a whole. The ultimate goal of researchers in synthetic biology is not only the understanding of life itself and how it functions, but applying the acquired knowledge to make a change within their community.
To investigate the current state of the research and its acceptance in society, we talked to scientists and asked them how their work has influenced their community. Nonetheless, it is of absolute necessity to include the entire society. We decided to do this by organizing a panel discussion evening dedicated to the topic 'Synthetic biology - Bricks for a healthy life?', i.e. synthetic biology in medicine.
As research in general and especially synthetic biology relies on a community, on interaction between researchers and the exchange of ideas and expertise, we asked experts and researchers from different fields to join us for this evening and we distributed flyers and placards to invite the broad society. However, we wanted to go a step further: The panel discussion was not limited to the audience in Heidelberg, it was simultaneously translated from German to English and broadcasted it via a live stream.
Despite the great enhancements synthetic biology can achieve, engineering with building blocks that are so close to the basic principles of life itself comes with a range of ethical questions and security precautions to consider. We see it as our immanent responsibility as iGEM team to address these questions and to take concerns very seriously. Hence, we invited Prof. Dr. Axel Bauer, who has been member of the German ethics council for several years and Dr. Joachim Boldt who works as assessor for the German ethics commitee for ethical implications of synthetic biology. Both of them are highly involved in the field of medical ethics also due to being professor for this subject. In order to review the safety concerns, we were very glad to have Dr. Harald König, who works at the Institute for Technology Assessment and System Analysis, as our guest.
Different experts were invited to an interdisciplinary talk evening
Politics and law play a very big role when discussing the application of synthetic biology in real life. Researchers need to obey the juridical boundaries and on the contrary the legislature"

NCTU_Formosa,2014,Team:NCTU Formosa#project_-_-_TEXT.html," ornamental trees in California. The fruittree leafroller, Archips argyrospila, is the most common leafroller pest in landscapes throughout the state. It occurs on many ornamental trees—including ash, birch, California buckeye, box elder, elm, locust, maple, poplar, rose, and willow—and is particularly damaging to deciduous and live oaks. It also attacks numerous fruit and nut trees including almond, apple, apricot, caneberries, cherry, citrus, pear, plum, prune, quince, and walnut(24).
Control: Several parasites attack OBLR larvae but do not adequately control the pest. Apply sprays during June to kill the first summer brood adults and newly hatching larvae(24).
Bombyx mori
Spread: the place where farmers want to feed.
Characteristics :  It is entirely dependent on humans for its reproduction and does not occur naturally in the wild(26).

- We need to grow the arabidopsis in advance to shorten the time frame of every generation.
- Fungi has a much better uptake then arabidopsis so it might be better.
- We should send mails to all relevant labs.
- Maybe we can search for a place they already have full grown symbiotic mushrooms (talk with tomer again).
- When we read articles, we should care much about concentration.
- If we use the fungi, maybe we can find a relevant assay for the connection between the fungi and plant.
- Assaf (Mentor) said that we should concentrate on the next topics when we read articles:
○ Enzymes.
○ What kind of reactions.
○ What are the products.
○ How can we detect and follow the reaction prosses.
- We might be able to do a research with bacteria to create bacteria that can live on TCDD and mutagenesis. Mosquna sent us an article about the method of finding the bacteria that prosses the T4D. Mosquna says he has a friend that deals with this kind of things so he might ask him for bacteria populations.

- All anaerobic enzymes may not work in aerobic organisms.
- Red team should be divided in the different enzymes. (we might ask the help of our associated students).
Red team should check:
- Do the enzymes work in the context of our organisms?
- Do they need any other enzymes to work?
- Do they work in plants and bacteria as well?
- We should look again for a way to break the products to CO2 and water.
- We need to reconstruct the 4 experimental pathways to start constructing our experiments.
- Regarding the assay, mosquna thinks we should check the formation of our product to test the enzymes.
- We should check how much the Aliza and Hagit proposes cost and where we can get it.
- We should look for NEB sponsorship.

SVCE_CHENNAI,2017,Team:SVCE CHENNAI#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html," we went to Sri Vivekananda Matric and Higher Secondary School where we taught simple synthetic biology concepts  to high school students.To make the session more interactive, we conducted some fun events like dogma quest – a play with knowledge of central dogma of life wherein the students were given a sequence of DNA and asked to predict the sequence of the protein that will be made out of it. This helped them to understand the concepts of transcription and translation better.
Finally we visited Sankara Senior Secondary School and presented the basic idea of our project to the students. They were very interactive and asked us many questions.We were also appreciated by the teachers for the efforts put in to spread the knowledge about synthetic biology and its related fields.
On the whole, the Human Practices team of SVCE_CHENNAI had a great time and managed to inculcate a basic knowledge of synthetic biology amongst the public. Our efforts encouraged the students to learn more about the subject and they were willing to do projects based on it although it was not a part of their curriculum.
OMICS - A National Level Symposium
Omics is a one day national level technical symposium that is organized by the Department of Biotechnology, SVCE on an annual basis. This year 600 students from all over the country and from different fields of study participated in it.
We used this platform as an opportunity to spread the knowledge about synthetic biology, iGEM and our project REGULOGEM among our peers. We provided them with brochures where a brief description of our 2017 project was given which helped them to understand it better.
In addition to this we taught them about BioBrick assembly with the help of illustrative charts and by using the game BioBrick. Most of the students who visited our stall liked the project that we are working on and some of them were even motivated to participate in iGEM. The link to the BioBrick game can be found below:

In order to collect valuable feedback and to spread awareness about our project, we visited several Life Science companies . Of the many we visited, the following stood out.
The first company that we visited was Levim Biotech LLP, where we presented our project to the CEO, Mr Jatin Vimal and his colleagues. Throughout the presentation, they raised some very important issues and also provided some constructive feedback. They were very impressed with our presentation  and hence decided to sponsor our project,  ReguloGEM 2017.

Linkoping_Sweden,2017,Team:Linkoping Sweden#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," you see academic research relating to biomanufacturing as different from industrial research related to biomanufacturing?
What do you think you or the government could do in order to encourage the industry to change its way of production to biomanufacturing?
All the contributed questions from the teams were compiled by team Harvard and a Google Form was created. The survey was then sent out to as many people as possible in the areas of interest.
The result from the survey came from 30 people from the countries Brazil, Finland, France, Sweden and USA. The majority of these people (16) was involved within the academia, nine of these had industry as primary area of expertise, two participants who answered were politicians and three participants answered “other area” than those areas mentioned above.
The survey consisted of several statements where the survey-takers could indicate their level of agreement. The statements appeared in different ways depending on how the participants answered. Results from a few of these statements can be seen in the three figures below.
A few questions in the end of the survey had open-ended questions, which we thought was very interesting.
Some of the answers to the question “what are the major roadblocks to the progress of the field of biomanufacturing?” included; environmental safety issue, costs, development difficulties, market acceptance and biosafety.
An answer that occurred several times, and people thought could be a problem, was about the governmental regulations and the laws. However, these responses did not come from any politicians.
When the survey-takers gave their opinions about what they thought will be the direction of the field of biomanufacturing, medicine/the pharmaceutical industry was a repeated answer from many. A few other answers, to give some examples, were – focus on specialty chemicals, additives in cosmetics, replacement in current animal based food production and rationally designed cells as biofactories.
Through this survey, we have obtained a good overview about people’s interest, knowledge and thoughts about biomanufacturing.

Results [1,2]
Each cell population, which represents different time range of the monitoring, has been subjected to an annexin V assay at the instant looked for. Unfortunately, a wrong dilution of the annexin buffer caused the death of each cell population during the test. Even if results were convincing for the monitoring at +24h, +30h and +48h by simple comparison between the control and the test population in the microscope (figure 1), we could not confirm it by cytometric analysis.
Figure 1 : cells morphology with or without p53 wild-type incorporation
Because we could only start DU-145 culture at the beginning of October, the two weeks needed to reach the necessary confluence did not let us to try a second experiment.
However, several studies showed that to bring p53 wild type into tumor mutated cells launch the apoptosis process. It is notably the case of the study leaded by Chunlin Yang in 1995, who was working, like us, on mutated p53 prostatic cancer cells (Tsu-pr1). The p53 wild type were not transfected by electroporation but by infecting tumor cells by non replicatives adenoviruses containing p53wt (AdCMV.p53). 48 hours after the infection of a tumor population with AdCMV.p53, a high expression of p53 is correlated with an important rate of cell death. If control populations (non-infected cells and cells infected with adenovirus containing lacZ gene, AdCMV.NLSßgal) show a similar and healthy morphology, condensation and cell detachment are observed in p53 infected population. To check if the death process followed by cells correspond to the apoptotic way, a migration on agar gel of their genome has been realized.
Figure 2 : Electrophoresis on agar gel of isolated non-infected DNA cells (a), infected by AdCMV.NLSßgal (b) and AdCMV.p53 (c).
Infected by AdCMV.p53, cells show multiple bands (laddering pattern) while non-infected cells or AdCMV.NLSßgal infected cells show a unique one at high molecular weight. These results indicate that the cell induced by p53 wild type is from apoptotic origin by the genome fragmentation observation, consequence to the CAD (Caspase Activated DNase) activity, a specific endonuclease of the apoptotic process.

Aalto-Helsinki,2014,Team:Aalto-Helsinki#Research_-_-_TEXT.html," and as well as FixJ seems to be rapid and responsive process and presumably most of the delay occur in transcription and translation of our reporter protein. The response to increase in light intensity is contributed by YF1 phosphatase activity (Diensthuber et al., 2013) but to be able observe the effect in the reporter concentration, we need to have short enough half-life. Indeed, it seems like our reporter, GFP-LVA, has short half-life. Although Andersen et al. (1998) suggest this half-life to be around 40 minutes, we observed a lot faster degradation of GFP-LVA. In the between 4th and 5th timepoint, the fluorescence drops from 2.9 to 0.6 in 25 minutes. According to these values, the half-life of the GFP-LVA we used in our experiments, would be around 11 minutes, at maximum. Moreover, in our actual light response element gfp will be replaced by cI. The GFP half-life (26 hours, Corish et al., 1999) is approximately 2.6 times longer than that of CI (10 hours, Parsell et al., 1990). As CI is not as stable as GFP, CI-LVA may be less stable compared to GFP-LVA potentially leading to even shorter half-life. Therefore, we estimate response to be around 15 minutes at promoter level in our three channel gene switch. We hypothesize that this enables sufficient temporal control for several industrial applications.
In our experiments to address the effect of varying light intensity on our light response element, we observed that the average intensity seems to be the dominating factor for the response. However, we also noticed that the effect of blinking light is not exactly comparable to constant blue light with same average intensity. We may use an efficiency multiplier to compare the blinking blue LED (from zero to certain maximum intensity) to constant blue light. The maximum intensity of the blinking LED multiplied by the efficiency multiplier tells the corresponding constant blue light intensity. We estimated the value of this efficiency multiplier empirically to be at the scale of 0.65 to 0.7 in our experiments. As long as the blinking frequency is short enough compared to the half-life of the CI protein, the perturbations will be averaged out in the response of our system. This would enable use of the three channel gene switch in bioreactors where the intensity of the LEDs will be nonuniform. If the bacterial culture is mixed constantly in such conditions we should have a uniform response to blue light.
There are several options to optimize and improve our"

In the next step, the preliminary products cellubiose from the first layer would diffuse to the middle layer of Sugarfilm due to concentration gradient. Beta-glucosidase BglX (from Cytophaga hutchinsonii, BBa_K118028 , iGEM08_Edinburgh) expressed in the middle layer would now work to degrade the disaccharide into glucoses. As the simplest saccharide and the starter substrate of many synthesizing pathways, glucose can diffuse to the upper layer of Sugarfilm and set off the last step of the reaction system.
The upper layer of Sugarfilm is capable of being designed to host any synthesizing pathway starting from glucose. Except for the versatility, such design can protect cells from being harmed by synthesized products detrimental to the cell. Since the procedure happens in the top layer of Sugarfilm, the undesired by-products in the system could be got rid of quickly, which would lead to death of only a small amount of cells in the biofilm, ensuring the integrity and functionality of other regions of the system.
 
Generally, with proper medium flow outside the biofilm, final products and wastes would leave the system immediately, and the continuous nutrient input provides good conditions for upper layer renewal. In ideal conditions, Sugarfilm could stick tightly to the substrate sheet surface until the whole sheet was degraded thoroughly.

The transfer line and ion source were held at 320 °C and 230 °C, respectively. Mass spectra were taken between masses m/z 30-300 with an ionization potential of 70 eV. Retention indices of standards were determined by co-injection of a C7-C30 n-alkane mixture (Supelco) and were compared with published retention indices.  MeS (Sigma-Aldrich, M 6752) was used as a standard. MeS was detected as a pure peak with a retention index of RI = 1198 (lit. 1191). Ethyl acetate extractions of LB cultures (either controle BL21, BBa_K1060003 or BBa_K1060003 with 0.1 mM salicylic acid (SA) supplemented in the medium) were measured in SCAN-modus with a splitless injectie of 1 µl. No MeS was detected in the controle sample (BL21) but in both other samples MeS was present. For the sample without addition of SA, just a small amount of MeS could be observed (see figure 1).

The mass spectrometer was turned off between 14.5-16 min. to avoid the measurement of extremely abundant peak (which was identified as indole). MeS could be detected at 13.6 min. Inset: measured spectrum at 13.6 min, confirmed as MeS (C8H8O3).

UIUC-Illinois,2012,Team:UIUC-Illinois_-_-_TEXT.html," the PUF toolkit will focus on tethering enzymes of productive artificial or natural pathways for kinetic favorability.
PUF
This is the PUF protein found on the PUM1 gene in humans. Our main focus and cause of interest in this protein is its ability to recognize single stranded RNA with specificity. The ability to modify PUF with tethered or fused proteins allows for the development of a customizable RNA binding toolkit. Depending on what fusion or tether is used, the functionality of the PUF protein is modified as well.
RNA scission
In fusion the PUF protein to a restriction endonuclease, the fusion protein demonstrates the ability to cleave single stranded RNA molecules with customizable specificity up to eight base pairs. Considering this ability, we believe PUF can prove itself as a promising new tool in researching and developing new types of gene therapy as it can silence genes with seqeunces specific to a reseachers interest.>
RNA scaffold utilization
Since PUF has affinity towards RNA molecules, it is possible to synthesize or utilize existing stemloop structures in RNA in order to provide a kinetically favorable platform for tethered proteins to interact.

Preparation of Esvelt medium for turbidostat study on the influence of casamino acids on the bacterial growth
Esvelt medium was prepared according to the instructions found in (Esvelt et al., 2011). Different amounts of casamino acids were added, evaluating the effect on the growth by OD measurement at different timepoints (one measurement per hour).
Several transformations were performed in order to gain the Dickinson plasmids or rather identify the problematic aspects of the triple transformation implemented in week 27. Therefore, MP1 was transformed in different amounts (1 ng and 100 ng) in electrocompetent S1030, as well as in chemocompetent Top10 cells. As a control, pSB1C3 was also transformed in S1030 for investigation of the general competence of the cells."

iGEM Evry 2012 achievements
Asides from having lots of fun, meeting great people, gathering around cheese and wine and lazying around the Genopole gardens during lunch break, we also did a little bit of work. Here is a list of our achievements:
We brought a new multicellular chassis to iGEM
We submitted 21 biobricks to the registry, including the first working Xenopus biobricks
We characterized 12 Biobricks: BBa_K812000 , BBa_K812050 , BBa_K812010 , BBa_K812030 , BBa_K81203 , BBa_K812032 , BBa_K812110 , BBa_K812130 , BBa_K812132 , BBa_K812133 , BBa_K812200 and BBa_K812233 .
We designed a method for testing multicellular systems in Xenopus rapidly
We provided 3 new plasmids for using this method, which include debugging tools, BBa_K812000 , BBa_K812200 , BBa_K812300
Our reporters and promoters were characterized .
We did a collaboration with Team Slovenia and we injected their construction into our fertilized embryos: Results
We designed a multicellular hormonal system
We created an Auxin production ( BBa_K812014 ) device for use in eukaryotes from the prokaryote one
We submitted the Tir1 ( BBa_K812012 )  auxin detection device to the registry
We showed the first Synthetic ecosystem , with a unicellular chassis (E.coli) improved inside a multicellular chassis (Xenopus)
We designed a new biobrick standard
We demonstrated it works (still with a low efficiency) and that the protocol have to be further optimized
We managed to assemble parts with a very high efficiency using Golden Gate and the GoldenBricks plasmids
We used a multi-level approach to model various aspects of the physiology and cellular behaviour of Xenopus.
All our models fit together to comprehensively depict all the processes from the experimental protocol to reporter expression
We used many modelisation techniques ( Ordinary differential equations , some derived from partial differential equations and Gillespie algorithm ) in order to benefit from their respective strength.
We submitted an extensive report of our conclusions about synthetic biology in vertebrates, which is the fruit of our long reflection we conducted over the summer.

Wellesley_HCI,2012,Team:Wellesley HCI#Notebook#KimberlyChang_-_-_TEXT.html," needed to get rid of our menu. We are most likely going to be sticking strictly to color as the trait that we are going to modify in order to simplify the interaction further. We are additionally going to move away from a “cute” aesthetic towards something more mature-looking in order to appeal to the more adult audience at iGEM. We discussed testing the prototype installation at Wellesley and also potentially at the Discovery Museum. For the next stage of the project, we need to think about affordance – basically customizing the cubes to distinguish them – and the aesthetics of the installation. My next task is to work on how the E. coli will look and start creating a short animation of the installation by Friday.
June 21: I finished creating mockup screens of most of the screens we will need. One of the problems we’re struggling with is how we will incorporate a “tutorial” aspect to the installation to help people figure out how to use the cubes. I came up with several different options for how we can tackle that issue. I can also created mockups of the Surface. I developed three options for what the trails of the E. coli will look like. Meanwhile, Wendy had been thinking about what kind of housing the cubes would have, as we plan to “hack” the cubes by taking them apart and fitting them with custom casings that resemble petri dishes, beakers and the like to simulate a lab environment. We talked with Orit, who seemed very excited by the progress we’ve made. She suggested that we make the plasmid circular to better resemble what actual plasmids look like. She also thought that if we decided to keep the “malfunctioning” creature, we should make it do something interesting. That way, people wouldn’t be as annoyed when their experiment failed.
June 22: Today was a frustrating day of trying to figure out how to display images. The goal was to get a gif animation to play on the cubes, but after I encountered a lot of difficulty getting that to work, I tried focusing on just getting one image to display. I followed an online tutorial, but when I tried to substitute my own image, the program stopped working. We tried making new projects, altering the source images, pretty much everything we could think of, but nothing worked.
Week of June 25
June 25: I decided to take a break from getting an image to display and switched to working on the code that would let users select from a series of colors. I looked at the demo files included from the Sifteo SDK and borrowed code from the Slideshow"

Formal Lab Session - 28th September 2009
Previously Metal Sensing Team tried to ligate cotC biobrick with pmutin4 and transform E.coli DH5 cells. Although the transformations have worked, the control plates wothout the insert had also colonies.
We selected 10 colonies from the plate with the insert + the backbone and inoculated to LB+Amp for ON cultures for tomorrow's miniprep.
We prepared some agar gel.

37 degree for 1 hour.
Run the sample on 0.8% agarose gel.
Scan the result under UV light.
Midi Prep
It seems the No.6 has the high probability to be the right clone.
We carried out a Midi Prep for No.6 Midi culture cells.
Conclusion
After the ligation, pGFP-rrnB:kinA has 2 HindIII restriction sites, one is inside the kinA sequence, another was located in pGFP-rrnB backbone. When we cut the pGFP-rrnB with HindIII, two fragments would be generated. One is about 8000bp sequence, another is 2000bp sequence .

Valencia,2009,Team:Valencia#A short story#Osamu_-_-_TEXT.html,", I extracted and purified luciferase from dried Cypridina. I was surprised at the large quantity of dried Cypridina that was stocked in the Princeton biology department, which included sealed bottles dated 1928 and a sealed tin can bearing the name of Sakyo Kanda, a pioneer in the study of bioluminescence. There was also a large amount that had been collected for intended military use by the Japanese army during the war, seized by the U.S. Navy at the end of war and then donated to Professor Harvey's lab. Dried Cypridina, even if it is many decades old, luminesces when crushed and mixed with water.
Miss Yo Saiga arrived in December 1960 to work as our research assistant, and my wife, Akemi, arrived the next month just after the inauguration of President John F. Kennedy, after a delay of four months due to her visa problem.
On June 23, 1961, Dr. Johnson, my wife, Miss Saiga and I departed for Friday Harbor. Dr. Johnson had purchased a new Plymouth station wagon for the trip. We loaded it with a large photometer, other instruments and chemicals needed for research, and suitcases for four people on the roof. It took us seven days to cross the continent, with Dr. Johnson driving the whole way. Upon arrival, we met our host, Dr. Robert Fernald, at the Friday Harbor Laboratories, University of Washington.
Friday Harbor is on San Juan Island, which lies east of the city of Victoria on Vancouver Island. The scenery of San Juan Island was splendid. The sea was clean and beautiful. At low tide, there were colorful sea urchins and starfish in various sizes scattered on rocks, and some abalones. There were also abundant fish. We could easily get rock fish of about 30 cm long using simple lures from a boat or rocky shore. We often ate them as sashimi. Indeed, Friday Harbor at the time was a kind of paradise for us.
For research space, Dr. Fernald assigned us part of a large laboratory. There were three other scientists in the room, and one of them was Dr. Dixy Lee Ray, a professor at the University of Washington at the time, and later chairperson of the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission and governor of Washington State. She was always accompanied by her dog, even though dogs were prohibited in Friday Harbor Laboratory by a state law. She declared that the animal was her assistant.

Nanopore Sequencing Enhances DNA Purification
Besides the cell extract, the DNA quality is the key to phage assembly. Impure DNA (Host DNA, proteins contamination) complicates the assembly of the phage within the cell lysate. A highly sensitive method to measure DNA is Oxford Nanopore sequencing. 6
Our first attempts with classical chloroform/phenol extraction failed because of low molecular DNA (agarose gel). Therefore, we decided to search for other purification protocols, DNAse I and the Norgene kit (46800) tremendously increased DNA purity. With this DNA, we were able to achieve high titers by assembly.
Illustration of DNA composition after purification, 3S phage DNA was purified from the E. coli host by chloroform-phenol (CM) and column extraction with and without DNAse I treatment after cell lysis.

The main task after receiving genomes was to assemble the phage genomes from the Nanopore reads without the reference         genome and gain the origin sequence. There are several tools available but for minION Nanopore recommended tools are         ""canu"" and ""miniasm"" of which we used the latter.
Despite an excellent lab team, we have been confronted with a major problem: contamination. Contamination is a problem         regarding the therapeutic usage of the bacteriophages, but also an important factor in any bioinformatics pipeline         because contamination-based reads can confuse the assembly process. We thus developed Sequ-Into to detect         the contamination and also get rid of contamination-originated reads. In the context of our project, several DNA         purification protocols were evaluated with Sequ-Into. This allowed iterative engineering cycles in Phactory, leading to         unparalleled purity of up to 96% (bases sequenced).
While evaluating the sequencing data with Sequ-Into, we noticed that in the first 10% of the sequencing time"

Valencia_UPV,2014,Team:Valencia UPV#Modeling#fba_-_-_TEXT.html," 1.5-bisP.  Moreover, the presence of oxygen and rubisco also catalyzes an oxygen reaction, photosynthesis   efficiency is reduced, and the carboxylation-oxygenation ratio is +3:1.
Model assumptions
In plants,  most genome-scale metabolic network reconstructions minimize the photons consumption (Ex16) while growth rate or biomass (BIO_L) rate is kept fixed.  This is true if we mainly seek the survival of the plant. In such a   case, photons consumption will be the optimization objective.
In our case, the principal objective is maximizing the pheromone production. In other words, optimizing the efflux V3 (see Figure 2) from the exchange reaction ExZ11.  In addition, we must introduce the lower (lb) and   upper (ub) bounds for each reaction.  The bounds for the flux reactions Ex16, BIO_L and ExZ11 were fitted according to Table 1.
Table 1.  Upper and lower flux bounds in the AraGEM model.
Optimal pheromone production using FBA
The optimum flux distribution is defined as the flux distribution that maximizes palmitic acid flux, for a fixed rate of biomass synthesis, and free photon uptake.
Table 2.  FBA results for each scenario.
The metabolic contrast between photosynthesis and photorespiration is illustrated in Figure 4.  In addition, these scenarios need a minimum value of photons uptake, this is evident since the plant needs light to survive. During   photosynthesis (Figure 4A and 4B) we see an increase of the palmitic acid exchange flux when the photons uptake is unconstrained (actually allowing it to reach the default maximum flux in COBRA, i.e. 1000).
Even when the photons flux increases freely,  most palmitic acid is used for plant growth.  Therefore, the new palmitic acid exchange flux only becomes 5.33 [arbitray units] (see Table 2).  However, this low level is somehow forced   by the high growth rate that was fixed according to the few existing  literature references.
Figure 4.  Optimization during photosynthesis with two different objectives fluxes A) minimizing photons uptake and B)   maximizing palmitic acid exchange.  During photorespiration, metabolism products decrease, such as C) photons uptake and D) palmitic acid exchange.
During photorespiration, we used FBA to optimize and analyze both palmitic acid exchange, and photons uptake.  Figure 4C"

Vector 02 is designed to test linker parts, or parts that control the expression of the Open Reading Frame parts they are next two.  In Vector 02 the part is flanked by two distinct reporter genes, that by comparing the relative expression of the 2 reporter genes we can determine the behavior of the linking part.

The Gatekeeper
PROTEIN SECRETION AS SIMPLE AS OPENING A DOOR
The Gatekeeper project could offer a tremendous new tool for recombinant protein secretion in E. coli.
View Project
Description
The Gatekeeper aims to implement a doorway in E. coli’s external membrane that could be opened and closed on demand ! Such universal “transform&go” type of secretion tool would represent a tremendous improvement for recombinant protein production or other biotechnological applications as secretion in E. coli remains a challenging problem.
Our plan was simple : we wanted to use mutagenesis tools and a strong selection design to build a door from an existing f1 bacteriophage porin. We were inspired by this filamentous bacteriophage virions escape strategy which are able to escape E. coli’s grasp through the porin without ever injuring their host.
Can the Gatekeeper revolutionize biopharmaceutical and industrial enzymes production ?

University of Virginia’s iGEM team: Collaborative Survey
The University of Virginia’s 2014 iGEM team designed a short online survey in order to learn about prevailing attitudes toward synthetic biology in the general public. Through this survey, they aimed to help future teams develop targeted educational events regarding synthetic biology.
We (the iGEM Calgary team) helped out by surveying over 40 people during our outreach events at the Telus Sparks Centre! Many people we encountered had misconceptions about synthetic biology. We were able to explain to them the significance of synthetic biology in medicine, the food industry and the environment. We are looking forward to hearing about the results of the survey and the University of Virginia’s iGEM teams suggestions for future educational events!
University of Columbia: Low budget iGEM Contest
The University of Columbia’s team  challenged  iGEM teams to figure out a cost effective way to transform bacteria, extract DNA and amplify genes of interest in order to make molecular biology globally available. Of course team Calgary accepted the challenge! We attempted to make competent cells using calcium supplements available at the local pharmacy.
Attempt #1:   There were many types and blends of calcium supplements at the pharmacy. Our first choice was calcium-carbonate.  We soon discovered calcium carbonate has very low solubility which led to unsuccessful transformation.
Attempt #2: Our second choice was to use calcium citrate which is physiologically compatible and has a relatively high solubility. Physiological compatibility was important because we didn't want anything"

Team Norwich
To help the iGEM team of Norwich we also cooperated with this team. Therefore we collected soil in the garden of one of our team members. We sent 15 g soil to NRP-UEA-Norwich, which they want to screen for novel antimycins.
By sending them probes we hope to support this team to successfully conduct their iGEM project.
The TU München iGEM Team in Freiburg
During summer time iGEM team München has been several times in Freiburg to work in the lab of Prof. Dr. Reski at their Physcofilter-Project. Using the opportunity, we swapped ideas on our iGEM projects, sponsoring and human practice and organized a big barbecue.
German Teams - BMBF congress in Berlin
On June 27th the german iGEM teams were invited to the ""Biotechnology 2020+ conference"" in Berlin by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research.
The aim of this conference was to discuss questions about the future of biotechnology. Therefore experts in the fields of economy, politics and academia came together to present their ideas in discussion rounds and workshops.
Three members of our team participated in the congress and presented our project in a poster presentation and discussion.  We had a great exchange with other iGEM teams and with experts from academia and industry.
Together with other iGEM teams we planned a German iGEM day which took place at September 7th in Freiburg, Bielefeld, Marburg, Munich, Bonn and Tübingen.
German Teams - Synbio Day
In cooperation with other German iGEM teams we organized an information day about synthetic biology.
Every team arranged a telling attraction in order to give some insights in synthetic biology, the team project and iGEM. Besides our team Bielefeld, Marbug, Munich, Bonn and Tübingen participated on this day. You can read more about it on our Human Practice page .

FACULTY FAMILY FESTIVAL
On 8th October we were invited on the family festival of our faculty, where all faculty members could bring their family and show their daily workplace. Together with the visitors, we looked into a Lego microscope and did a little pipetting workshop, while we explained them about iGEM and our project.
WEEKEND VAN DE WETENSCHAP (NATIONAL SCIENCE WEEKEND)
The first weekend of October was the Dutch weekend of Science (Weekend van de Wetenschap). During this weekend, all scientific institutions and museums open for the public with special science programs and workshop. The goal of the weekend is to involve everyone in science and show how interesting and fun science is! Of course, as an iGEM-team we could not miss out on this fun event. Together with the Science Center in Delft, we organized a workshop where people from all ages could feel like a real scientist for a day! We opened a special lab for the occasion where we taught people, both young and old, about DNA. The participants then could put on a labcoat and become a scientist themselves! We set up an experiment where people could isolate and visualize DNA from a kiwi. Luckily"

ENTREPRENEURSHIP
Entrepreneurship
In previous years, iGEM had an entrepreneurship track. Teams were encouraged to build projects and focus around commercializing their work. For 2015, we're removing the track and introducing an award for entrepreneurship.
Note
In order to be considered for the Best Supporting Entrepreneurship award , you must fill out this page.
The Best Supporting Entrepreneurship award recognizes exceptional effort to build a business case and commercialize an iGEM project. This award is open to all teams to show that entrepreneurship is something all teams can aspire to do with their project. This award can go to an new project, or to a previous project that a team aimed to commercialize. Have you filed a provisional patent on your project/device/process? Have you raised money to build and ship products? Have you pitched your idea to investors and received money? Complete the entrepreneurship section on the 2015 Judging form and tell us what you did. As always in iGEM, the aim is to impress the judges!"

Metabolic Channeling
Metabolic channeling is the process whereby metabolic intermediates are channelled between the active sites of consecutive enzymes in a biochemical pathway.  This serves to increase reaction efficiency by limiting the diffusion of metabolites into the surrounded cellular intracellular environment.  Channelling provides a biochemical system with benefits such as:
Enhancing unfavourable reactions
Sequestering toxic intermediates
Protecting unstable intermediates
Preventing inhibition of other enzymes by the channelling intermediate
Channeling has been utilized in bioengineering to enhance the efficiency of desired biochemical systems.  Some methods which have been utilized to mimic examples of metabolic channelling in nature are through:
Immobilized Enzymes
Fusion Proteins
Scaffolds
Immobilized Enzymes                         Fusion Protein                          Scaffolding
The Project
Our project aims to take advantage of the catechol degradation pathway present in P. Putida by introducing metabolic channeling to increase the efficiency with which catechol is degraded. Besides being toxic in it's own right, we anticipate that accelerating the degradation of catechol, a common product of polyaromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) degradation, will result in increased PAH degradation.  This hypothesis, supported by computer modeling will be tested in an E.coli model using the synthetic construction of several variations of the pathway involving the channeling of different pairs of enzymes by protein fusion.
Future Goals
Once we complete the characterization of the “Encapsulator” micro-compartment from the 2009 iGEM project, we will evaluate whether compartmentalization can further enhance the effects of metabolic channeling as compared to gene fusions. Ultimately, channeling will be introduced to target pathways in endogenous tailings ponds species (e.g. P. Putida) for application in the bioremediation of the tailings ponds.

The two BioBricks form a pair which are designed to specifically bind to each other while ligated to two different promoters of overlapping specificity. This results in an integrating of the conflicting outputs of the two opposing gene systems.
Our system relies on two constructs that interact via complimentary base pair sequences both before and after the ribosome binding site of the reporter protein. The idea being that, when both transcripts are present in the chassis, they would bind together, inhibiting the translation of the reporter proteins. Any imbalance of transcription due to the presence of the substrate of interest results in free mRNA of the gene system that detects that substrate. Crucially, if both promoters detect the same substrates but differ with one extra substrate being detected by one of the promoters, it is this substrate and this substrate only that our system will be able to detect in a simple and quantitative way.
Our team have constructed a countercurrent comparator circuit in which the reporter proteins are at the same end of the complimentary region, although a contracurrent system has been theorised. Both systems share a crucial subtractive nature comparable to an analogue computer. We envisage that, should the system be fine-tuned and expanded on, a variety of different business sectors from agriculture to spinoff pharmaceutical companies (such as the fictious QuantaCare which you can read about on our wiki) could capitalise on this novel genetic technology. What we have produced is a BioBrick pair that work in harmony, when ligated to promoters of interest and genes of interest, to sequester translation when both mRNA transcripts are present in the cell. The use of quantitative tuners with these BioBricks is encouraged to ensure that the transcription rate both gene constructs are equal when both promoters are transcribing at their optimal rate. Although the parts have been submitted to the registry and theoretically characterised, time constraints have meant that further lab-based characterisation could not occur. However, we hope to utilise any free time in our timetables during the next semester to characterise the BioBricks further (please see our project proposal), and hope that we will be given a chance to present our further findings at MIT!
To conclude, what we have created is a pair of antagonistic BioBricks that turned the pair of mRNAs in which they reside into translational repressor molecules when both are transcribed in tandum within a specific chassis of interest, a new application for mRNA complimentary base pairing within the registry and a project we feel could go very far indeed.

5. Ensure that personnel are adequately trained (with updated training for new techniques, risks and organisms in the lab).
6. Create groups or sub-groups dedicated  to matters of biosecurity within the lab or work areas.
7. Design and publish good laboratory practices manuals for personnel working in the lab.
8. The lab has to notify the relevant authorities of the genetically modified organisms kept in it.
9. Lab personnel have to keep a record of their work on genetically modified organisms for tracability (the lab notebook!).
10. An emergency protocol has to be defined in the case of an emergency or accident involving the release of genetically modified organisms in the external environment, so that the health of researchers, the general public and the integrity of the environment can be protected.
The law also repeats all of iGEM's rules involving the BioSafety Level (BSL) of micro-organisms used during our projects:br>
All chassis and used DNA sequence characteristics (function, known effects on humans and other organisms, origin...) have to be known and taken into account for risk evaluation.
No pathogenic organism or known pathogenic DNA part may be used without special approval by the High Council for Biotechnologies
The European Directive 90/219/CEE also classifies BSL levels and the corresponding level of equipment and safety measures that need to be executed in order to limit or prevent dissemination of genetically modified organisms into the external environment. The document can be freely accessed here (in french).  As there aren't only biological risks in a synthetic biology laboratory, we also need to take into account safety measures for the other risks. These are principally chemical risks relating to the use of certain chemicals in synthetic biology. These chemicals can be ethidium bromide (a known mutagen), guanidine hydrochloride (poisonous) or acrylamide (a known neurotoxin), among others present in the lab.  The prevention measures put in place by the labor code in France include:
1. The evaluation of risks in the laboratory
2. Adapting the work and the workplace to the individual rather than the reverse
3. Continuously keep work areas up to date with recent equipment
4. Replace dangerous chemicals with less dangerous chemicals where possible
5. Plan risk prevention, taking into account techniques, workplace organization, work conditions and social relations between employees and possible external factors.
6. Prefer collective protection measures over individual versions.
In order to set an example for safety, we have strived to respect these rules"

Why a Supermarket – general aims
The project Super Cell is a fictional supermarket offering speculative products, which are all based on Synthetic Biology. The projects aims to improve public awareness about Synthetic Biology and at the same time, foster a debate on how we want to see it manifested in our everyday lives. Implications of Biotechnologies are usually discussed on a philosophical, ethical, legal or possibly religious level. All these areas share a pretty abstract perspective on the matter. By designing speculative products and presenting them in a familiar environment such as a webshop, we aim to create tangible manifestations which allow specialists and non-specialists to engage in a discussion about the desired and undesired implications of Synthetic Biology. If we -as a society- want to influence how this powerful science will affect our future lives, this kind of discussion is essential to have now.
As we want that discussion to start, Super Cell doesn't end with iGEM Competition 2010. Rather the Jamboree is the starting signal for an intensive presence in public with which we want to guarantee the sustainability of our project.
Future prospects and sustainability of the Project
To achieve this three things will be focussed:
1. The web shop Super Cell
The web shop Super Cell will be available all over the world. People can experience a world in which products that are enabled by synthetic biology belong to our every day life.
The shop includes products that come from the art context and tend to start a societal discourse, unconvertible today but with a clear biology background that proves that in (far out) future they might become reality. But the shop also highlights products that are based on previous iGEM projects, with already working mechanisms of the synthetic biology. Conceivable is to keep on working on the Super Cell web shop and to include over the years more and more possible products that come up with the iGEM competition.
2. Exhibitions
Enter the synthetic biology supermarket, smell it, touch it, feel it. Buy and change your life. In the exhibition the already existing and far-out in the future applications are put next to each other – on supermarket shelves, in walk-in environments and access points to virtual representations. The first exhibition will take place in Weimar, Germany in spring 2011. Starting from that the exhibition will travel to Heidelberg and should be shown afterwords"

We also designed primers to amplify by PCR two epimerases from the Agrobacterium tumefaciens C58 genome. These epimerases showed great yields in the literature. We wanted to compare the efficiencies of these epimerases and to see which one was the best for our bioproduction techniques.
To express these Dpe, we decided to insert them into pSB1C3. We readily produced clones of the Dpe from C. cellulolyticum with RBS and pTacI promoter ( BBa_K2448033 ) in pSB1C3 and one of the A. tumefaciens Dpe with RBS ( BBa_K2448034 ). Knowing that the A. tumefaciens Dpe was already well characterized we decided to start our production with the C. cellulolyticum Dpe.
Bioproduction of Psicose
To bioproduce psicose from fructose we had to choose from many bioproduction methods ( Click here to find out more ). Since our goal was to test if we were able to produce psicose with our cloned Dpe we chose the fastest and cheapest method: Batch cultures for a whole cell production. Indeed, this technique requires little material and offers strong resistance to environmental perturbations. It also limits the purification steps compared to in vitro or cell lysate. This is essential for us since we want to directly measure our psicose with an HPLC. This method has still some limitations such as culture conditions that do not match those of the enzyme, therefore our yields may be limited.
Study of the Strains and Culture Conditions
Having a plasmid containing a gene coding for the Dpe from C. cellulolyticum, under the control of a pTacI promoter, we first investigated in which strain we would perform our psicose bioproduction. We were interested in two strain of E. coli: Top10, a strain often used for cloning and biosensor characterization, with a fast growth and a high plasmid replication; and BL21-AI, a strain used for expression of recombinant proteins. We compared the growth of these strains.
The cultures were made in Synthetic Medium to ensure its exact composition and avoid column deterioration in further HPLC measurements. We also wanted to investigate the impact of the carbon source on the growth of these two strains. We used four kinds of carbon sources: Glucose, Fructose, Glucose + Fructose and Glycerol + Fructose.

Equations
d(Acetate)/dt = fAcetate – (comp*Acetate) – (fAcetylCoA*Acetate*CoA*E1) -( dAcetate*Acetate+µ*Acetate)
Acetate is formed by the cell and gets either converted in competing reactions or by Enzyme 1 to AcetylCoA. Also Acetate is degraded constantly.
d(CoA)/dt = -( fAcetylCoA*Acetate*CoA*E1) + 2* fButyrate*[Butyryl CoA]*[AcetylCoA-ButyrylCoA transferase] – (dCoA*CoA + µ*CoA)
CoA is recycled in the pathway and is needed to produce AcetylCoA and becomes free in the Formation of Butyrate.

Open day of BNU lab
On september 8th , 2015, freshmen of collage of life science were welcomed to the BNU-CHINA laboratory. At the beginning of their new term, with the invitation of our team, they came to the iGEM laboratory. They got in touch with the iGEM and got a brief understanding of our project this year.
Fig. 17 Open day of BNU lab
We started our propaganda from Greek mythology Sirens. Through the old story that Sirens attracted sailors by her beautiful sound and then killed them, we introduced our project about killing nematodes by a very simple and clear way. We also introduced our members, the responsibilities of different groups, the situation of our human practices and the expectations for the future of iGEMers and so on. Because they will be the core members in the future. We let them know something about the iGEM team and have more information about the damage of the nematodes. We hope they can love our team. And we are looking forward that these freshmen will become the future stars of our team and we also expect these iGEMers will make great contributions to the iGEM or even in synthetic biology in the future.
The opening of the laboratory not only attracted the freshmen of our college, but also attracted reporters of our university. They interviewed our team members and we introduced our project briefly.

Solubilization
The resilience of silk to many different solvents is well known. In order to dissolve silk, we used lithium bromide, a strong chaotrope[1] that disrupts the hydrogen bonds and thus secondary structure of the silk.
We dissolved our silk in 9.3M LiBr at 60 C for 4 hours.
Silk solubilized in 9.3M lithium bromide.
Deionizing Dialysis
Silk solution dialyzing against DI water
Following the dissolution of silk, we dialyzed the solution to remove the LiBr and any other salts to obtain a purely aqueous solution of silk.
We dialyzed our silk in SnakeSkin Dialysis Tubing of 3.5 kDa molecular weight cutoff against double deionized water. We dialyzed for 48 hours with a total of 6 dialysis bath changes. Following dialysis, we centrifuged the solution to remove any flocculents and other insoluble proteins.
Concentration Dialysis
The previous dialysis results in an aqueous silk solution with concentration ranging from 4% w/v to 8% w/v (40 - 80 mg/mL). This is too dilute to spin into a fiber, so the solution must be concentrated by dialyzing against a highly concentrated polymer solution. The polymer solution draws water out from the silk solution by osmotic pressure.
To concentrate, we dialyzed 10 mL of aqueous silk solution in a Slide-A-Lyzer dialysis cassette of 3.5 kDa Molecular weight cutoff against a solution of 10% w/v 10,000 molecular weight PEG for 18 hours. This will yield an aqueous silk solution of 15-18% w/v (150-200 mg/mL) concentration. Dialyzing the solution for too long will overconcentrate the silk dope, which will lead to the silk forming a gel in the cassette. Once a silk has gelled, it is no longer usable in any further processing steps.
19% w/v silk dope after concentration dialysis.
Spiking with the GFP co-spinning module
GFP co-spinning module was added to the silk dope such that the resulting solution had a 1:750 mass to mass ratio of GFP co-spinning module to native B.mori silk.
Spinning the composite silk
In order to form fibers from silk, soluble silk protein solutions must be much like how they are in natural spider spinnerets. The majority of spinning methods entail pushing, or extruding, silk"

        Solve that differential equation.
        1/(N-n) dn=k*fex (t) dt         ∫1/(N-n) dn=k∫fex (t) dt         -ln(N-n)=k∫f ex(t) dt + C

Clearing
 
Footer
Adding a footer following the columns, yet still inside the .container, will cause this overflow:hidden clearing method to fail. You can place a .footer into a second .container outside the first one with no detrimental effects. The simplest choice may be to start with a layout containing headers and footers and remove the header to utilize the clearing methods in that layout type.
Backgrounds
By nature, the background color on any div will only show for the length of the content. This means if you're using a background color or border to create the look of a side column, it won't extend all the way to the footer but will stop when the content ends. If the .content div will always contain more content, you can place a border on the .content div to divide it from the column.

A Penny Etched by Ferrooxidans
Our Source Cells
Our Electroporation Game
This year Columbia- Cooper iGEM hosted a table at the 2012 Maker Faire in New York City. Our table featured posters explaining both the genetic and chemical aspects of out project, games to teach children about recombinant DNA and bacterial transformation as well as pennies etched by our A. Ferrooxidans with the letter ""C"" to represent each of our schools as well as the chemical symbol for copper.
Each of our games contained plastic spheres which represented cells and a strip of blue, yellow and orange DNA. We explained to the kids that we took DNA out of our source cells, cut out the parts we wanted and put them back together in a new combination. Now we need the kids help to put our new DNA into a cell so it can be used. In the conjugation game the 2 cells were connected by a plastic tube and the goal was to move the DNA from one cell to the other. In the electroporation game the kids used a wand with a magnet on the end to slide the recombinant DNA through one of the large pores into our cell. As the kids worked on the game we had a chance to explain to their parents that in the lab we do this by shocking the cells with 1800 volts. Finally our chemical transformation game involved throwing the DNA into our competent cells. In order to help keep the DNA in the cell rather than sliding right out we attached a small magnet to the bottom on the DNA and put a piece of metal between the cell and the base.

Taken amount of serum performs less (2-3 fold) than 3 ug/ml a-GFP.
Evaluation of the relative intensity shift. From left to right spot 1-11. For each spot rel. intensity shift is plotted with bars for Serum(-)flush and Serum(+)/a-GFP

If unicode_c of each chain is different with others, then we could sort the chain list by comparing their unicode_c (just the same with comparison of two strings). However, it is not always so: chains with same unicode_c may be equivalent or not. It is due to the mark asterisk *. Unicode_c knows where are the binding sites, but it does not know the binding details of that part. In other words, unicode_c could not solely determines the order of the chains since it lacks of information of the trees defined in our Chain-Node model. The forest (set of trees) in Chain-Node Model describes the binding details of parts in chains. We need to find something like unicode_c to represent the essence of the associated trees. Our weighting scheme will be first introduced below.
Assume the chains are sorted already. Each part will be assigned a weight based on its position in the chain list. The weight of the jth part on the ith chain is (i,j). For example, the first part on the first chain posses a weight (0,0) (in C style, counting number from zero). After assignment of parts' weight, we turn to weights of the nodes in trees. Since leaf nodes in trees are actually the representation of parts in bond state on chains, the weight of each leaf node could be inherited from the weight of its corresponding part. For parent node, its weight equals to the maximum of weights of all its children nodes (we define a weight (i, j) is greater than another (i',j') if i < i' or i = i' while j < j'). The recursive definition of tree nodes' weight make it possible to sort the forest. For convenience, we add a virtual node ROOT, whose weight value could also be obtained under the general rule, as the root of all trees in the forest and make a conversion from forest to tree. The tree structure could be uniquely determined by recursively sorting all children of each nodes by their weights.
Back to the question above, if two chains have the same unicode_c, which should be arranged ahead? The answer lies in the exchange of them. The exchange will change the parts' weight on both chains and thus the weight of some nodes of the trees. The tree structure (with virtual root) is also possible to change. If the tree structure is not changed, the two chains are equivalent, which means that it makes no difference to arrange either chain in front of the other. If"

Peptides are electrostatically attracted and accumulate at numerous sites covering the surface of the membrane, which will eventually lead to the formation of transmembrane pores. The cell died of the content outflow.[1]
Project scheme
Through the yeast factory, we can achieve mass production of a good deal of antifungal peptides, these eukaryotic expression of antimicrobial peptides, can be used for biological control of wheat scab (you can see more information by clicking HERE !) . At the same time, we pay close attention and strict supervision to the downstream wheat processing products. We can utilize the hardware(you can see more information by clicking HERE !) of our project to carry out wheat processing products in the residual DON and ZEN detection, if the content is beyond the criteria of the national standard, we can then utilize the hardware to carry out the degradation of toxins, so that the food DON and ZEN content can be greatly reduced.
Response Module verification
Through the graph of zone of inhibition experiment we can see that compared with negative control treated with sterile water, different concentrations of Cecropin A, Plant Defensin Corn 1 and MtDef4 can show the inhibition and killing of Fusarium graminearum spores, in higher concentrations of the Cecropin A and MtDef4, the antimicrobial peptides can show a similar or even more bactericidal activity compared with positive control—Carbendazim, which is dissolved in acetic acid at a final concentration of 100ppm.
Fig.1 The inhibition zone results show the three antifungal peptide can exhibit a great antifungal activity, and the area of the inhibition zone is dose dependent. We choose to utilize sterile water as our negative control and 100ppm carbendazim dissolved in acetic acid as positive control. All the three"

Heidelberg,2017,Team:Heidelberg#Interviews_-_-_TEXT.html," our toolbox guide , since every researcher that wants to evolve proteins using PACE or PREDCEL should reflect on the outcome of their research. With the input of Dr. Janausch we could improve our Safety Net and hope, that other scientists apply the safety recommendations we developed with Dr. Janausch for their PACE or PREDCEL experiments too.
Dr. Jens Degner
Judge
Ordinary Jurisdiction North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany
We contacted the experienced judges Birgit Degner and Dr. Jens Degner to get their legal opinion on our research project. They were not able to give us a definite legal assessment, because our project is far too complex and based on too many different fields of law to find a quick answer, but they gave us a personal opinion.
From their point of view, science should be as unrestricted as possible, but by doing this, the scientist is assigned a crucial role: Each scientist needs to think if his research is compatible with their own moral values and make sure that all necessary safety measures and precautions are taken. The scientist is connected to and responsible for the research done, but in the end the consumers can and should use their market power to see if the findings are compatible with general ethical values. Ethical commissions can lead discussions, clarify research topics and help finding moral values.
They concluded that science should not be limited unnecessarily, because the ultimate goal is the improvement of the general quality of life for every human.

Dr. Lutz Greb´s objective is to investigate the ""Substituent-element cooperativity for homogeneous catalysis with p-block element compounds"". We approached him regarding the synthesis of one of our organosilicon educts, namely 4-(dimethylsilyl)aniline. As our iGEM lab did not meet the safety requirements to synthesis the compound by ourselves, we were happy that Lutz Greb and Fabian Ebner took over this complicated but essential task and provided us with sufficient amounts of the substance. They readily shared their knowledge and expertise in regard of all chemical obstacles. Furthermore, they offered GC-MS (gas chromatography–mass spectrometry) analysis and subsequent evaluation. With their help, we were able to follow through with our organosilicon project .

Collaboration
Our ability to write, read and share knowledge yields high attribution to human intelligence and its modernized environment.             Without it, we won't be able to stand where we are.             Scientists from all over the world work relentlessly on their research projects,             all aiming for the same goal;             to accomplish innovative and groundbreaking research, such that novel and valuable knowledge can be spread across the world,             and it is very unfortunate if these get lost because of language barriers.
Translation Service
The most common language that science is shared in and communicated throughout is English,             which is understood and spoken by most people.             However, not everyone is able to learn English due to poverty, isolation and tradition.            That is why we came up with a translation service.                         We aim to give everyone the opportunity to be informed of what iGEM is and what the students achieve during this competition.             It is also a great way for them to get in touch with synthetic biology and genetic manipulation and to explore its potential for reproducibility,             something that is currently held back and limited due to negative perceptions by the masses.
The purpose of this service is to translate the project descriptions of every team that we collaborate with into as many languages as possible.             To facilitate this collaboration,             we created a Google Drive account in which every collaborating team has been granted access as well as their own folder.             Every team adds their project description in their corresponding folder and every collaborating team will translate each             other's descriptions into their own native language,             in which they will put the translated file next to the original team description in the folder of the translated team. In the end,             every team's folder should contain a list of files with different languages,             such that people from every corner of the world can read project descriptions that are available in their native language(s).
During the competition, 15 fellow iGEM teams, for which we express our deepest gratitude, were willing to collaborate with us and make the projects more accessible to less educated people. We also chose to implement this collaboration on our Wiki-page as"

UCL,2016,Team:UCL#Dental hygiene_-_-_TEXT.html," has been recognized as an important determinant of psychological well-being and its aggravation has been associated with an elevated incidence of depressive symptoms (2). In our project, we designed a biosynthetic device to serve as an alternative in preventative dental care for the elderly.
The problem: Biofilm formation and cariogenesis
The oral cavity is inhabited by a wide range of interacting communities of metabolically and structurally organized microorganisms which synthesize an extracellular polysaccharide matrix (EPS) enabling them to adhere to the surface of the teeth and assemble in matrix-embedded biofilms. Progressing biofilm accumulation puts the bacteria under increasing metabolic stress which leads to localized metabolite and acid accumulation and a shift in the dynamic homeostasis towards acid-tolerating species such as Gram-positive Streptococcus mutans (3). A resultant decrease in pH causes tooth demineralization and constitutes a mechanism of dental caries.
Our approach: a bacteriocin producing device
A decrease in biofilm formation caused by interference with the viability of certain bacterial species presents an approach towards limiting cariogenesis. Our team designed a locus capable of producing and exporting a mature form of an antimicrobial peptide known as mutacin III, first identified in Streptococcus mutans UA787 isolated from a caries-active white female patient in the late 1980s (4). Mutacin III is effective against a wide range of Gram-positive bacteria implicated in dental caries, e.g. other strains of Streptococcus mutans and Actinomyces naeslundii, while Gram-negative bacteria are resistant to inhibition (5).
The biosynthetic locus was engineered by our team in a form allowing for high-yield and fine-tuned expression of mutacin III. We placed a strong T7 promoter upstream of mutA to obtain high levels of the propeptide, a repressible pTet promoter upstream of the mutBCDP co-transcription unit and an inducible araBAD promoter for the mutT gene, coding for the ATP-binding-cassette-like transporter of mutacin III. All illegal restriction sites were removed from the endogenous sequences by silent mutagenesis.

The next day, the bacterial culture was adjusted to OD600 = 3 and exchanged with M9 minimal media with 20mM of glucose for 4 hours or at different time points.
Glucose concentration was analyzed with Glucose (HK) Assay Kit (Sigma-Aldrich) according to the manufacturer’s instruction. Briefly, glucose was phosphorylated (G6P) by hexokinase. Then G6P was further catalyzed by G6PDH and the reduced NAHD was formed from the oxidation of NAD, resulting in increasing in absorbance at 340 nm.

As shown in Fig. 3, the growth of E. coli expressing the PTS reporter (i.e., crr and ptsG genes) was seriously retardant. As I mentioned earlier, the E. coli overexpressing glucose transporter may lose viability because of the toxic metabolites produced in glycolytic pathway. Not surprisingly, the PTS overexpression bacteria was almost unable to absorb glucose.

Fig. 4 represented that the cell growth of E. coli expressing the Na+/Glucose transporter was comparable and even slightly higher than the control group. The glucose began to be absorbed at the 3rd hour. The glucose uptake efficiency was achieved upto 97% in Na+/Glu group and greater than in control group with 1.2 times difference.

Discussion
We’ve successfully genetically engineered E. coli expressing high-affinity active PTS transporter system and low-affinity facilitated Na+/glucose cotransporter system by screening in MacConkey and glycerol agar plate with chloramphenicol, respectively. Our data is consistent with the previous study that overexpressing glucose transporter genes do really harm E. coli partly due to disturbing glycolytic pathways.
PTS expressing bacteria grew difficultly in LB broth but Na+/glucose transporter expressing bacteria grew comparably with general E. coli, suggesting that high-affinity active transporter did interact with sugar-related substances in LB culture media and harm the bacterial survival.
In our results, glucose absorption by Na+/glucose transporter expressing bacteria was achieved to 97% after 4 hours with 1.2 times enhanced efficiency compared to the normal E. coli. To further increase the rate of glucose uptake"

For children, probiotics are the important method to maintain remission. But for adult patients, it is still hard to observe this effect. Actually, intestinal flora is in large quantities and very complicated. Therapeutic mechanism of supplementary micro ecological preparation (probiotics, prebiotics, synbiotics, etc.) is not clear and sometimes it is hard to determine the clinical effects.
A2: Intestinal microecology is one of the factor causing inflammatory bowel disease. Treating inflammatory bowel disease completely through changing intestinal microecology still have a long way to go. For example, fecal bacteria transplantation is effective only in a few patients. (But for the inflammatory bowel disease with the concurrency of infection of clostridium, it is the first-line therapy.) Personally, treating inflammatory bowel disease in the direction of intestinal microecology is very promising.
Survey
This survey consists of three major parts: intestinal diseases, gut flora and synthetic biology. As people know life-related diseases, i.e. intestinal tract diseases, better than merely intestinal diseases, the survey is needed to start from a boarder aspect and be narrowed to intestinal diseases.
363 shares of answers are received, with 81.82% of which have no idea about iGEM. People above 40 years old contribute to 46.55% of all answers and people from 26~40 take up 15.43%. People below 26 account for 15.43%. Participants come from all walks of life, with only 36.36% of them being students.
In the first part we investigated people’s cognition in intestinal diseases. People believe that cancer and AIDS are the most severe diseases. Heart attack ranked the third, followed by Parkinson’s disease and Alzheimer’s, then the pneumonia. Intestinal tract diseases are among the least severe common diseases, as expected. However, 84.3% of participants have witnessed the suffering of intestinal tract diseases, with the cost of treatment covers a long range. 8.82% cost is below ¥100, 29.41% ¥100~500, 24.18% ¥500~1000 and 23.2% beyond ¥2000 . Only 6.21% participants claim that 1~2 days are needed to cure the disease, while different people suffer from various intestinal tract diseases, with the time required to cure ranging from days to more than half a year. Furthermore, 50% people get the diseases once or twice, while the rest suffer more often. Among all the intestinal tract"

Interpretation of the experimental data
We were not able to find any significant fit on the raw experimental data . To be able to still get information out of them, we had to consider that the maximal activation of our system was reached by the most dense and most fluorescent bacteria (which grew in high-glucose-content cultures), even though a clear plateau cannot be directly observed on our data (see Figure 3 below). This interpretation of the data was motivated by the hypothesis that fully activated bacteria were experiencing a high metabolic burden preventing them from reaching the OD they should have reached without this burden.
Figure 3. A) Final absorbance obtained depending on initial glucose concentrations of each culture. B) GFP fluorescence per A600 in response to population density. Colonies were grown over night in media with varying glucose concentrations that lead to different final population densities.
In practice, what we did to get exploitable data for our fit is the following: we fitted first a linear model on the first data points (unaffected by any burden) of the A600 vs. glucose to get the OD that each culture should have reached without burden. We used this adjusted OD value in the (therefore adjusted) data to fit our model. Here is how the adjusted data look like:
Figure 4. Adjusted data used for the fit of the expression of luxI.
Finally, because of the absence of replicates in the data, we had to estimate a meaningful standard deviation to be able to use our cost function for the fitting: we assumed a 25% standard deviation for each measurement point, which is the standard deviation that was observed in the data used to fit the expression of luxR.

ITESM_Mexico,2011,Team:ITESM Mexico#Modelling_-_-_TEXT.html," This first lock inhibits the expression of the reporter protein and that’s why at the same concentration with the same promoter there is the activation of our key (tast).
For high concentrations there is the promoter pbad wk, which can sense big quantities of arabinose. The promoter is also activated by action of the operators. Once the promoter is activated the process of expression is continued until the CFP is expressed. To express this protein the lock (crxwk) must be inactivated by the key (tawk) sequence. To assure that only the high concentration mechanism is enabled there is the necessity to turn down the low concentration, this is achieved by expressing an antisense sequence key (itast) that inhibits the production of the low concentration key (tast) sequence, thus the low-concentration lock (crxst) will activate and will inhibit the expression of GFP.

EPF_Lausanne,2015,Team:EPF Lausanne#Emilie#enjoy_-_-_TEXT.html," science communication - an intricate process in which scientists expose their work and the media relay this technical information to the general public. This is especially true in Switzerland, where the system of direct democracy and referendums allow the population to vote on very specific questions, scientific topics included. Research in synthetic biology could have come to an end had the 1998 federal popular initiative “for the protection of life and the environment against gene manipulations (initiative for genetic protection)” been accepted. Indeed, production, acquisition and handing-over of any genetically modified animal would have been prohibited [1].
Given the importance and relevance of this topic, we decided to investigate the issue of communication and interaction in the field of science. We began our investigation by attempting to identify the general public opinion before discussing this outlook with a panel of experts from different fields such as biology, ethics, politics, law, industry, religion and journalism. It quickly became obvious that the matters of communication and interaction raise extremely difficult questions, and we do not claim we have a final answer. Instead, we tried to highlight the different opinions we encountered during these interviews and help sketch the landscape of science communication in our country.
The GMO stigma
In order to assess how the general public perceives the field of synthetic biology, we designed a survey that we submitted to people passing by a stand we held in the streets of Lausanne. The survey and its results can be found on the Human Pratcices page of our website. The first salient result of our survey was that people reacted very differently to the subject of synthetic biology depending on whether the acronym GMO (Genetically Modified Organism) was present or not in the question they were asked. While our survey stimulated the interest and the curiosity of the subjects as they were reading and answering the questions (many even asked about the veracity of past iGEM projects), this open-mindedness faded out when the word GMO came up. These two seemingly contradictory positions underline a big problem in the way people in general understand synthetic biology, in Switzerland at least. We mentioned it to Prof. Denis Duboule, geneticist and professor at EPFL: “These reactions are very interesting”, he says, “It pinpoints the fact that that the word GMO has become a stigma. This situation accurately reflects the repercussions of poor scientific communication. After all, people only read what is given to them”. “GMO is one of those buzzwords we hear too often without actually knowing what is meant, apart from their association with controversies and scandals” notes Aurélie Coulon, journalist for the Swiss daily newspaper Le Temps.
