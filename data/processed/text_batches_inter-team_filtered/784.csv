MICHELLE WU
Hi! My name is Michelle, and I’m so excited to be a part of iGEM this year! This is my first year on iGEM, and it has been such an amazing experience. I’ve always loved science, but seeing all these innovations in the making has deepened that bond even more. I love classical music, watching figure skating, bubble tea, and all things food! When I’m not in the lab, you can find me at the piano or in the dance studio. See you at the Jamboree!

Hong_Kong_HKU,2014,Team:Hong Kong HKUST#riboregulator#characterization_-_-_TEXT.html," the variation of promoter strength (RPU) in different concentration of arabinose. Each strain of cells inoculated overnight in various arabinose concentration above. The cells were diluted around 10 fold and grown until they reached mid-log phase (OD600 0.3-0.5). Cells were fixed and fluorescence was measured using flow cytometer. The graph represent triplicate mean ±SD.
We thought that Relative Promoter Unit (RPU) defined by Endy et al. would be a better a measure of promoter strength at different arabinose concentration than simply comparing the  fluorescence measurement of different strains. This is because simply measuring and comparing fluorescence as an output can also be affected by other experimental factors such as the genetic context. Because RPU is a ratio to fluorescence measurement, the effects caused by these factors can be minimized (See Methods for RPU calculation).
We observed clearly a different promoter response among the three cell strains. The all-or-none response was observed for the strains, but the levels of RPU were different.  For DH10B, RPU leveled off around 0.45. For BW25113, RPU leveled off around 0.3. For DH10B and BW25113 we see a very clear “all-or-none” response. The RPU reaches a plateau at  0.2% of arabinose. For DH5α, it is less obvious, because the initial increase of RPU at 0.2% arabinose is around 0.1, lower than the other two strains. With the given graph,  statically, we cannot say that the RPU level gradually increases as % arabinose increases.
The lower RPU of DH5α was expected because DH5α has araC gene, gene for the repressor, in its genome. This could have caused the lower promoter strength of  PBAD in DH5α. All in all, all three strains produced all-or-none response.

Overall project
Synthetic biology is the creation of new functions using existing biological systems. In order to assist synthetic biologists, the 2009 Illinois tools team is trying to create a web-based open source program that outputs a theoretical pathway to synthesize a desired chemical product given an input and an output compound. The ideal network will have known reactions taken from the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG)database, which consists of well-studied organisms. The capabilities of our program will be exemplified by establishing a network for the synthesis of a biofuel and a pharmaceutical from various input compounds, as well as the elimination of a toxin.
Our program is modular and has 4 major components. The first aspect is obtaining reactions from the KEGG database via KEGG API and creating our own database. The second is using all the reactions from our database to create a network. The third is writing the script to assign the appropriate weight to each edge and determining the path of least weight. The fourth is using the resulting pathway to obtain additional information such as a stoichiometric matrix, enzymes that catalyze a specific reaction, and the genes associated with those enzymes. The final step would be to take a feasible pathway and proceed to the lab to test it.

Project Details
Database
As mentioned above we used information from the KEGG database to make our metabolic pathway tool. In order to organize the information and be able to retrieve it as desired, we created our own My SQL database with the necessary components for our network. The Kyoto Encyclopedia for Genes and Genomes has his own application programming interface (API) that  can be used to allow other software, such as our own, to interact with it.
Initially we thought that we would create our network using the API functions each time a request was submitted so that we would have the most up-to-date information. Upon testing that out we determined that it would take way too long for each query. This is due to the time it takes to access the database through the API as well as the limited function calls that are available via the API. To fix this problem, we created out own database that has all the information we need it. By doing this, we decreased runtime exponentially. We explored several options and began with sqlite3.  This was"

d-AuNPs Testing: ssDNAp interaction with EPO target DNA
The prescreening with d-AuNPs is tested with EPO DNA as target. To test the sensitivity of the prescreening, the EPO target DNA is lowered to 100 pM. Prior, the ssDNAp is heated up to let the ssDNAp anneal to EPO target DNA and create the secondary structure. The ssDNAp, EPO target DNA and hybridization buffer were incubated:
5 minutes at 95 ºC (denature dsDNA target)
1 minute at 57 ºC (anneal ssDNAp to dsDNA target)
10 minutes at 21 ºC
20 µL d-AuNPs, 10 µL target dsDNA (1 nM and 100 pM), 6 µL hybridization buffer, 4 µL ssDNAp 1 (1 µM) and 20 µL of a varying salt concentration (range of 0 mM to 1000 mM) were added to the 96 wells plate.

Harvard,2011,Team:Harvard#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," of these backbones (from entire ZF world)may NOT bind DNA (i.e., may bind proteins)
Risk: May not find anything that binds, then the whole project is a dud
What is the more important variable, helices or backbones?
Helices seem to be more important, backbones of secondary importance
Backbones: ZF's unravel DNA, open the major groove-- backbone is important here, changes the bond angle, etc. (Brandon's paper-??)
Balance needed between low and high risk
If we find backbones that we know bind DNA, greatly lowers our risk
Limited spaces on chip: zero-sum game
With a middle of the road approach, we diminish both benefits and risk (diminishes the benefits of the high risk approach much more than it diminishes the benefits of the conservative approach; i.e., if you're playing the lottery, you're more likely to win if you buy many more tickets)
We need to compare probabilities of randomly-generated OPEN sequences vs. probabilities of sequences randomly generated by our program
OPEN tries to cover all space: smaller probability
If we have a ""smarter"" algorithm, we can produce fewer
However,  the idea is not to repeat OPEN, but to go somewhere else, non-GNN sequences
Remember: OPEN is a Cell paper; the point of the project is not to compare ourselves to them
If we find binders for 1-2 of our sequences, that would be awesome
Probably we'll have some that find none, some have 10, our last one might have 1,000 hits (then, we do bioinformatics to figure out why/what those hits were)
Point: to learn and do high-level bioinformatics, and high-tech cloning techniques in the lab
If you do find binders, you can write a paper about it!
We have all the resources we need right now to build our chip
We need to pick out targets
Need to decide exactly what we want for:
No. of target sequences/which ones
No. of helices/ which ones
Ratio of zif268 backbones: non-zif268 backbones
Avoid switching Leucine out of position 4, then change other positions based on our frequencies
Chip Design
No. of sequences will be more than we can put on the chip
Helices: essentially unlimited
Put more-likely-to-bind helices into the risky backbones
Put less-likely-to-bind helices into a zif268 backbone

The derivations of the GFP synthesis rate are:
*Relative promoter strengths: J23104 = 1.3RPU, J23101 = 1.0RPU, J23100 = 0.92RPU, J23118 = 0.76RPU [73]
In absolute units: take GFP synthesis rate (molecules per min per cell) and approximate that as a generic protein synthesis rate for the promoter.
GFP synthesis rate of 101 = 2232 molecules per min per cell. [74]
Assume 1 molecule in an E.coli cell gives a concentration of 1nM.
∴ GFP synthesis rate of 101 = 2232 x 1nM = 2.2x10-6nM/min per cell
Plasmid copy number assumed as 200 (as in derivation 1)
∴ GFP synthesis rate of 101 in our E.coli = 200 x 2.2x10-6 = 0.00045nM/min = 0.45mM/min
∴ The GFP synthesis rates of other promoters can be calculated by multiplying the RPU value with the GFP synthesis rate of J23101 promoter.
The simulation result:
Although there is just a small increase the gene expression rate, J23104 promoter achieved a much higher PHB production than other constitutive promoters. Therefore, we decided to use J23104 promoter for our improved biobrick BBa_K1149051 .

TALE Expression
Background – pTAL1 vector
Based on the fact that Golden Gate is an effective way to assembly TALE (Transcription activator-like effectors) and various eukaryotic expression systems have been established but few in prokaryotic systems, we are determined to construct such efficient expression system in Esherichia coli so that we can test our brilliant idea. Through referring to numbers of paper, we find that most scientists choose to construct stable cell line via homologous arm such as attL1 and attL2 or they just introduce exogenous TALE[1].  Considering the principle of Golden Gate Assembly, we only need to reconstruct the final vector pTAL1 (figure 1) to solve this problem. The vector pTAL1 contains TALE N-terminal, TALE C-terminal, lacZ for blue white scanning and attL1, attL2 homologous arm. However, it lacks necessary elements for prokaryotic creature such as promoter, RBS and terminator. Here comes to our story of establish a TALE expression system in prokaryotic creature.
Figure 1. The original vector pTAL1
Constitutive pTAL
Wisely, we choose 3A assembly to construct our expression system. Firstly, we design forward and reverse primers with extension on which contains EcoRI, XbaI and SpeI, PstI restriction enzyme sites to get PCR prodcuts of pTAL. Then through naïve enzyme digestion and liagtion we can ligate pTAL with terminator, promoter and RBS one by one. And finally, we can easily get our constitutive TALE expression vector (Figure 2). And we also submit this expression vector as K1311003 ( http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K1311003:Design ) in part.igem.org.
Regulative pTAL
Similar to the method of constitutive construction, we make use of the ligated pTAL with terminator to continue our regulative pTAL construction. After browsing on the igem parts website, we find that there is no ideal regulatory parts that can be directly applied. We need to make use of some parts to get our ideal composite regulatory parts. Based on parts C0040, we added promoter and RBS, terminator, pTet (TetR repressible promoter, R0040) and R"

Douaa Mugahid
Biology for a better life is what Douaa believes in. Coming from a country where the availability of food and better health care is always an issue for the masses, she believes that as a biologist who can use science for the help of better, cheaper industrial/agricultural/medical use she has a lot to give to her own country and the masses at large. For those reasons Douaa studies Biotechnology as an undergraduate, but being faced with the immense costs that people are faced with in that industry in general made her want to think of how to bring them down. In silico optimization of biological processes away from the workbench in the lab seemed like the best idea, which is why she is currently doing a masters in Systems Biology at Heidelberg University. Being part of the iGEM team this year makes her know that as biologists there is so much we can do that is creative, useful and eventually cost effective and widely available for all researchers all over the world.
Anne Rademacher
Anne also just finished her 4th semester of Molecular Biotechnology at Heidelberg University. Next to her studies she had worked in Faiza Rharbaoui's group at Cellzome for three semesters. Regarding iGEM she looks forward to a summer with students from different studies and a lot of fun experiencing a new field of biology.
Hannah Uckelmann
Hannah is a student in the second semester of the Molecular Biosciences Masters Program with the major Molecular and Cellular Biology at the University of Heidelberg. She completed her bachelors degree in biochemistry at the Florida A&M University in the states. She has experience in obesity and cancer research and hopes to be able to contribute greatly to the wet lab work in this years iGEM project. She is excited to work on this fascinating project with a great group of students!
Lars Velten
After finishing high school, Lars spent a year volunteering in Development Cooperation, selling solar power to Massai people in northern Tanzania. Perceiving plants as the better solar cell, and also interested in everything else (but urchins), he turned to study Molecular and Cellular Biology at Heidelberg U, where he has now finished his 4th semester. He collected some wetlab experience during an internship with Kartsten Weis' lab at UC Berkeley, where he worked on a project studying proteome turnover. He is looking foward to working in Synthetic Biology.

TAS_Taipei,2017,Team:TAS Taipei#HP#Gold Integrated_-_-_TEXT.html,"ua Wastewater Treatment Plant
In order to learn firsthand about the effect of NPs in WWTPs, we visited the Dihua WWTP (迪化污水處理廠). Here, we were given a tour around the plant, and were able to ask questions to the managers and people who work there. They confirmed that the current facilities are unable to remove NPs from wastewater mainly due to their small size. In addition to this information, they kindly provided us with samples of sludge, effluent water, and the polymers they add during the wastewater treatment process.
We plan to add our bacteria to either the deep aeration tanks or the secondary sedimentation tanks. The disinfection tank will then kill the bacteria used in previous tanks.Figure: Christine C.

Throughout the year, we visited Dihua WWTP several times to discuss how our project could be implemented in their current system. We planned to add our proteorhodopsin (PR) bacteria in the aeration tanks, where other microbes already exist to break down organic solids. Our biofilm, attached to biocarriers, will then be placed in the sedimentation tanks (shown above). We gathered information about flow rates, tank dimensions, and water retention time in each tank to provide realistic conditions for our experimental, prototype, and modeling work. For example, during our conversation with WWTP engineers, we learned that wastewater is retained in aeration tanks and sedimentation tanks for up to 4.8 and 3.8 hours, respectively. This means PR and biofilm will only have up to ~5 hours and ~4 hours respectively, to interact and trap NPs in wastewater. Taking realistic timing into consideration, we added PR to citrate-capped silver NP (CC-AgNP) solution and mixed the solution for only up to ~5 hours (figure 2-6). We also added a flocculant powder (supplied by Dihua WWTP) to aggregate suspended solids, which mimics the next step in the treatment process.

Leaders of healthcare market and Collegium Invisibile
We aim to improve our Future Lanthan Hospital Model by means of cooperation with members and Alumni of the program ‘Leaders of healthcare market’ supported by Foundation 2065 im. Lesław A.  Pagi  and Collegium Invisible. Members of  iGEM Warsaw Team, ‘Leaders of healthcare market’ program and Collegium Invisibile wish to contribute to educational initiatives, hence our long term goal is to build a group of passionate young people who will continue spreading our ideas in the future. In these particular cases we feel an obligation to help in STEM education in medicine and to find some future leaders to take care of Lanthan Hospital Model. We also hope to perform several analyses related to our project in cooperation between iGEM team and members mentioned organizations. See annex 4 in the report 'Celulare - future leaders start here'.

Gel clean up of protein A and IgG protease
After running the gel I cut out with a scalpel the bands that looked like they corresponded to the vector containing protein A and the IgG protease cut out of the vector.
I followed the gel clean up according to the method described in protocols.
In step 2:
protein A = 200 mg * 3 = 600 ul of QX1
IgG protease = 200 mg * 3 = 600 ul of QX1
In step 3:
Both of the samples were added 30 ul of QIAEX II
In step 9:
Both of the samples were incubated in RT for 5 min
Spectophotometer:
Ligation of protein A and IgG protease
The vector should be about 25 ng and the gene that I want to insert in the vector should be about 3-5 times more.
Vector: 40 ng/ul
0.5 ul = 20 ng
Gene: 34 ng/ul

I sent two samples of the site-directed mutagenesis tyrosinase for sequencing. Colony nr 4 and 6.
Since I have the gene in the original vector I did not have any verification primers for the vector, however the site i have to control by the sequencing is in the middle of the gene and not in the beginning nor the end of the gene (which usually result in poor sequening data).

Biological Sciences (2nd Year Masters)
This is my second year on our iGEM team at the University of Calgary.  I am a master student in biological sciences at the U of C. My research is in investigating how RNA-binding proteins act to regulate various genes at the post-transcriptional level. Previously, I worked as a member of the Biofilm Research Group at the U of C, studying how bacterial biofilms could be applied to bioremediate environmentally contaminated sites. When I am not living/sleeping/supervising in the lab, you may find me in the mountains surrounding Calgary hiking and trying my hand at photography.

After the ligation had been performed, a gel electrophoresis was run to analyse the results. However, the results were not satisfying since too little product was present as could be seen in figure 2. Therefore, we were not sure if the ligation had been successful. However, the transformation was performed despite having too little DNA to see it on the gel.
Colony PCR of Ligation Products [✔️]
The  planned transformation mentioned in Result 2 was successful, 1 colony was observed for the assembled plasmid containing T7 and EC (pSB1K3-T7-EC) and two colonies were observed for the plasmid with T7 and EB (pSB1K3-T7-EB) after 18 h incubation.

3.3  Effect of lux pR leakage on Safety Catch plasmid
The leakage of lux pR refers to the extent of transcription driven by lux pR promoters not bound by AHL-luxR complexes. The leakage of lux pR is anticipated to have impact on the system as well.
The lux pR on Safety Catch plasmid serves as a vital “switch” that determines how easily the system can be activated. If it has a higher leakage level, the lacI expression driven by it should be stronger, thus inhibiting the expression gRNA, making the system more sensitive to AHL’s activation effect. On the other hand, lux pR with strictly low leakage level might result in a system difficult to induce. An optimal level of leakage of lux pR might be a key factor to building an optimal system. Herein, we use our model simulation to validate these thoughts.
As shown below, the AHL concentration is set to be 10-8M, which should not be suffient to induce the system"

TUDelft,2017,Team:TUDelft#Main-Applied Design_-_-_TEXT.html,"je is studying higher professional education livestock farming. She helps her dad on his dairy farm.
Current situation
Testing whether an infection of a particular cow with mastitis is caused by antibiotic resistant bacteria is currently an expensive and laborious process ( WVAB 2015 ). Typically, a farmer will first treat the cow with standard antibiotics. If this does not work, the farmer turns to lab analysis: he/she sends a milk sample to a company specialized in diagnostics, which then analyse what antibiotics are appropriate for treatment. This whole process, from sending in a milk sample to finding out what antibiotics to use, can take up to 3 days [refers to integrated human practices ]. This process adheres to a guideline ( Formularies ) that is followed by veterinarians when prescribing antibiotics.
Formularies
Formularies are national guidelines for the veterinarians, by the WVAB (Workgroup Veterinary Antibiotics Regulations) - KNMvD (Royal Dutch Society of Vetenary Medicine). These documents prioritize the antibiotics that can be given to treat a disease. Veterinarians are allowed to prescribe first choice antibiotics. The prescription of second- or third choice antibiotics need legitimate reason depending on laboratory results or monitoring activities.
Putting relevance into our design
When initialising mastitis treatment, it is of great importance to know that the infection is commonly caused by 6 different species of pathogens, the most harmful being Staphylococcus aureus (SAU) ( GD Diergezondheid, 2017 ). This pathogen forms the biggest threat to the cow’s health and is highly contagious. To treat mastitis, first choice antibiotics are first used. These antibiotics are shown in the table below.
Ranking prescription antibiotics  ( WVAB 2015 ):
First choice antibiotics: are used for empirical therapies. These antibiotics can be included in the farm treatment plan without further reasoning.
Second choice antibiotics: cannot be used except if there is enough reasoning to prescribe these antibiotics. These antibiotics can be limited included in the farm treatment plan.
Third choice antibiotics: can be used in exceptional cases. These antibiotics cannot be included in the farm treatment plan.
Fourth choice antibiotics: forbidden to use on food producing animals.

Synthetic Biology: Education in an Emerging Field
The iGEM competition is devoted to the advancement of synthetic biology, specifically in standardized parts-based research.  It welcomes participants from institutions of higher education from around the world.  Just as important as contributing to the understanding of molecular biology based engineering is contributing to a framework which allows applications of this knowledge to be implemented in a manner that serves society.  As we address human practices on our wiki we give a brief overview of synthetic biology, list areas in human practice commonly recognized as needing address, pose questions for discussion associated with those areas, and outline two ways  the iGEM community can take fundamental actions.  These actions involve a broader education of iGEM participants, and the dissemination of knowledge in our educational and public communities.
Synthetic Biology and Human Practices
Synthetic biology has been hailed by some as the next technological revolution.  It has been said that standard biological parts “will be for the 21st century what screws and bolts were to the 19th, or transistors and resistors to the 20th (Endy quoted in Parens, Johnston, and Moses, 2009).”  Members in the field have visions of using synthetic biology to develop new applications in the areas of environment, health, and industry, as well as learning to understand the fundamental components of life itself.  Significant progress has already been made evidenced by the ever increasing size of the registry of parts with applications in the areas listed above.  With time other applications will likely arise.
As with any new technology, there exist potential benefits and potential areas of concern.  There must be a balance between the desire to bring innovative and beneficial products to market and prevent potential harm to public health and the environment (Rodemeyer, 2009).  Following are some of the issues that are commonly indicated as areas that must be addressed.
Biosafety:  How can research personnel, the environment, and society be protected from intended or accidental exposure to developed products?
Biosecurity:  What measures should be taken to ensure that products of synthetic biology are not used in a malevolent manner?
Property Rights:  What is the best way to share information to ensure"

Warwick iGEM - Modelling and Kit Plate Exchange
The Warwick team requested our help with modelling transcription and translation rates - a key process aspect in our system. Through Skype meetings, we guided them on how to use Hill functions to model transcription rate, including an explanation of the relevant approximations and the parameters that they would require.
In addition to modelling, we helped Warwick by providing them with a vector, resuspended from the kit plate. This was critical for their team as they had depleted their stocks and needed the part for their project. In return for this help, they provided us with kit plates for the Interlab after our own supplies ran out. This allowed us to complete the measurement study, for which we are incredibly grateful."

Introduction to L7Ae & C/D Box
L7Ae and the C/D box used in our project are a group of archaeal RNA-protein complexes with a dissociation constant of about 1 nM (Saito et al., 2009).                     L7Ae, a component of the archaeal ribosome, is able to bind to a kink-turn RNA motif called the C/D box (Saito et al., 2009).                     The C/D box contains two sets of conserved RNA sequence motifs termed the box C (consensus sequence: RUGAUGA ) and box D (consensus sequence: CUGA) (Saito et al., 2009).
Structural organization of L7Ae and the C/D box (Gagnon et al., 2012)
Design overview
We inserted the C/D box to the 3’-UTR of the cargo mRNA,                     which can bind to the archaeal ribosomal protein L7Ae. In addition,                     L7Ae was conjugated to the C-terminus of a transmembrane protein CD63 which anchored inside the exosomal membrane.
Aim of the design
We designed to  package a specific mRNA,                     which encodes a protein with therapeutic value, into our engineered exosomes.                     L7Ae is anchored to the interior of the exosome membrane by fusing with CD63.                     Then the therapeutic mRNA together with the C/D box gains the ngability to bind to L7Ae and in this sense,                     the mRNA is loaded into the engineered exosomes during the biogenesis process (Kojima et al., 2018).
Test of the construct
We constructed three plasmids pcDNA3.1-CD63-L7Ae, pcDNA3.1-nanoluc-C/Dbox (nanoluc encoding nanoluciferase),                     and pcDNA3.1-nanoluc to test the efficiency of the loading of the target mRNA into"

Aachen,2017,Team:Aachen#Applied Design_-_-_TEXT.html,"filtration could be used for separation. However,            ultrafiltration is well-established in wastewater treatment plants using membrane technology to hold back microbes like antibiotic resistant strains or yeast.
Different pore sizes conclude in different pressures needed to press water through the membrane. Reverse osmosis is highly energy-consuming with pressure differences across            the membrane of up to 120 bar. Micro- and ultrafiltration on the other side are significantly more energy-efficient with needed pressure differences of 0.1-3 (microfiltration)            and 0.5-10 bar (ultrafiltration) [1].
The use of micro- or ultrafiltration concludes in lower costs due to lower pressures and redundant pressure stability of machine parts. Additionally, the whole set-up of the            filtration-methods is simpler and less maintenance intensive, which is one of the main disadvantages of reverse osmosis.
In cooperation with GE, a producer of membrane modules, we were able to prove the crude and maintenance efforts needed for ultrafiltration by conducting a membrane experiment to          separate yeast from water with a small-scale ultrafiltration membrane, which is commonly used in wastewater treatment. See Integrated Human Practice – GE
Together with the membrane, provided by GE, we used a conventional piston pump creating a low-pressure of around 0.5 bar to purify 0.625 liters of            water per hour from yeast with success. The flux of 0.625L/h is equal to a flux of 7500L/h through a membrane surface of 300m2.These numbers approximately            simulate the fluxes in small wastewater treatment plants using membrane technology.
Together with micro- or ultrafiltration, well-established methods in wastewater handling, the desalinization of water from ions using a modified yeast is significantly           more energy- and maintenance-efficient than using reverse osmosis to separate the ions.
Nutrition and After-Usage
Nutrition and after-usage of the yeast remain as unsettled questions for an application in wastewater treatment. Yeast is not able to grow directly in salinized water, making separate breeding necessary.     Growth of the yeast depends on the availability of an external C-source, a cheap by-product of many industrial processes. A meaningful nutrition of the yeast must be set-up for      specific industrial applications. After separation of the water, yeast, filled with ions, drop behind. We utilize the nutritional value of yeast and add it to fouling towers for enhanced gas      production. Final burning of the cells would leave behind dry salt, which must be re-used or stored permanently.

Dual Prevention And Treatment Of AIDS
     HIV mainly infects CD4+T lymphocytes, and it                                         identifies host cells by binding the surface glycoprotein gp120 to CD4 receptors                                         on                                         the surface of CD4+T lymphocytes. Cyanovirin-N(CV-N) is a protein which can bind                                         nearly irreversibly to gp120 and changes its conformation, so HIV has no chance                                         to                                         bond to CD4 receptors. But this bonding only happens during the early time of                                         HIV                                         infection.
     We intend to transfer the gene that expresses the                                         CD4 protein into Lactobacillus                                         plantarum and transfer CV-N gene into the downstream of Luxs-mediated quorum                                         sensing                                         system originally existing in lactobacillus plantarum. When HIV enters the human                                         body, it will be bond to the engineering bacteria to form a mass complex, which                                         will                                         lead to increase of the local density of the engineering bacteria to the                                         threshold                                         value of the quorum sensing system. As a consequence, engineering bacteria can secret the CV-N protein immediately.

Site Specific Recombination Techniques Used In Phage                                         Therapy For Pneumonia
     The phage treatment is just over its horizon.                                         However, this new therapy has not been applied clinically due to the excessive                                         host specificity of natural bacteriophage. In response to this problem, we use                                         site-specific recombination to widen the host range of Streptococcus pneumoniae                                         phage Cp-1, making it infectious to Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus                                         influenzae, and thus provide a new way treating pneumonia.

When these informations are considered, it is clear that production of TIpB protein is IPTG dependent and Western-Blot can be performed because of its His-Tag site.
As shown above,we planned to clone the ordered GadE gene into peT-45 vector by using BamHI and XhoI enzymes. Final construct after this cloning is, respectively T7 promoter-Lac operator(LacO)-HisTag-GadE. Besides, a constitutive promoter called LacI promoter and LacI protein sequence in front of that, found on peT45-b vector’s another part. It is obvious that this part is IPTG-dependent, so Western Blot can be performed easily with the help of His Tag.

GadE-PSB1C3 CLONNING
We cloned IDT G-Blocks GadE gene into PSB1C3 vector in order to make it ready to be submitted and have many copies of it. For this purpose we digested PSB1C3 vector and GadE G-Blocks with ECoRI and PstI restriction enzymes. Then we ligated these cut genes into the plasmid by using T4 DNA Ligase . Ocurring products were transformed into BL21 competent cell strain.
To check if the cloning is correct, a colony PCR was perfomed with Verify Forward and Verify Reverse primers. If the cloning isn’t made properly t the band should be 314 bp long, but if colony PCR worked, then bands should be 858 bp long.
As the result of colony PCR, the possible right cloned colonies were incubated in liquid culture for 16 hours. After this incubation, we isolated plasmid DNA from this bacteria culture by miniprep plasmid isolation method. We controlled obtained colonies with cut-check for a second cloning control. We used EcorI and PstI restriction enzymes for cut-check.
GadE-pET45-b CLONNING
We cloned GadE into PSB1C3 vector successfully, then moved on cloning it into the expression vector pET45-b. For cloning into this plasmid, we removed our gene from PSB1C3-GadE plasmid with BamHI and XhoI enzymes. Then we ligated the cut gene with pET45-b which was cut with the same enzymes"

Several variations of kill switches can be found in the Biobrick registry. K176036 is a Tetracycline repressible construct that can kill cells, for example. In our lab, cleaning protocols will have to be adjusted to account for a possibly ethanol resistant bacterial strain. Rather than wiping hands and surfaces with hand sanitizer and/or alcohol, hands should be washed with soap and water and surfaces decontaminated with 10% bleach. Studies done by the Gaston Day School 2009 team showed that the kill rate of 10% bleach is very rapid and almost 100% effective.
Tests are underway in the lab to determine the sensitivity of our isobutanol strain to ethanol and isopropanol. Plans are also being made to incorporate some form of repressible kill switch into the strain.

Cadmium Detector
The surrounding areas of Duke Energy’s Buck Steam Station have unintentionally been affected with millions of tons of coal ash containing multiple toxic chemicals including cadmium. The release of this ash has caused the water to become a health hazard with the potential to cause a wide range of symptoms: flu-like symptoms, kidney damage, fragile bones, and possibly death through prolonged exposure. To minimize the damage caused by cadmium in water both locally and globally, our 2012 team created several heavy metal detectors, but in 2013 we decided to concentrate on the cadmium detector. The detector responds to the presence of cadmium with green fluorescence. Next, the team worked to increase the sensitivity levels of our detector. Our detector needed to be able to respond to cadmium at low enough levels that the detection would be useful and the presence of cadmium would not already be apparent. This year, we completed the addition of the 2007 Cambridge team's sensitivity tuners to our detector. The sensitivity tuners amplify the signal received by the detector. At the end of last year, after adding the sensitivity tuners, we began to see indications of a peak at lower levels of cadmium than we had previously thought. To define that peak, we used test points that were closer together. We discovered a peak of fluorescence and identified our detection points.

MITO-MORHPIN' POWER YEAST!
Controlling Translation in Yeast Mitochondria
Saving the world one cell at a time
Welcome to Team RHIT's iGEM 2016 Wiki!.
Our Project
Our project focuses on how to control the aerobic respiration of yeast cells by manipulating the expression of mRPS12.Without mRPS12, yeast mitochondria lack a functioning ribosome and become unable to produce proteins necessary for aerobic respiration.  By expressing the mRPS12 protein in a haploid mRPS12 knockout strain, we investigated its usefulness as a means of regulating aerobic respiration in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.  This project is a continuation of the RHIT 2015 iGEM project, Mitochondrioff.

Overall project summary
Today paper is used in quantity every day and will be waste after use.      In Japan, for example, they send new year's card to relations, friends and acquaintances every year.      So some cards are thrown away when it is written incorrectly, stained or sent from disagreeable person.     It is a sheer waste to throw away many cards, so it is great idea that we transform card into MOCHI, tranditional Japanese food made from rice and composed of amylopectin.      Paper contains cellulose, and both amylopectin and cellulose are polyglucose.      Why we can't the transformation?
We genetically modify Escherichia coli and make 2 type of function. One of the function is synthesis of cellulase, which is enzyme analyzes cellulose into glucose. Another is synthesis of amylopectin synthetic enzyme. We use them to analyze cellulose (it compose new year’s card) and synthesize amylopectin (it is main ingredient of MOCHI). In 2008, the iGEM team of the University of Edinburgh studied reducing cellulose to glucose. We refer to this study and improve it to reduce cellulose. On the other hand we introduce gene coding amylopectin synthetic enzyme from Oryza sativa into E.coli to synthesize amylopectin in body of E.coli. In fact, E.coli have a function to synthesize glycogen from glucose in natural. So we use some parts of this function and remove some of them to realize the efficient transformation.

Day 25
Test crystal violet staining of biofilms (using 23/07 tox assay plate)
Protocol.
0.1% w/v crystal violet solution made up by dissolving 0.080g crystal violet in 80mL Milli-Q.
96-well plate was taken out of plate reader at 10am and left on the bench until 4pm.
Contents of plate decanted into biological waste bucket and each well of plate washed with tap water for 4 rinses to remove planktonic cells.
125µL of 0.1% crystal violet solution added to each well, and left to stain for 20 minutes.
Contents of plate decanted and each well rinsed thoroughly again to remove unstained crystal violet.
Plate left to dry overnight.
Comments: Growth curve assay plates are non-ideal for biofilm screening as the shaking incubation of the plates in the plate reader means that biofilms are formed more on the walls of the wells than the bottom of the wells.
Week 6
Day 27
Biofilm Cultivation Using Existing Transformed Strains
Biofilms grown in triplicate wells according to tox assay layout, except the wells with 0.002% final arabinose conc is replaced with 0% arabinose conc (i.e. arabinose replaced with Milli-Q).
Each well has 100uL total volume of 1:100 diluted overnight culture.
Round bottomed plate was used.
Left for incubation on bench for 48 hours.
Day 30
Biofilm Staining
First, measure the OD600nm of the biofilm culture.
Decant and wash the round-bottom well plate that has been incubating at room temperature for 2.5 days (see protocol)
Do CV staining and monitor 500-600nm using whichever machine is available
If biofilms are shown to grow, we will proceed with monitoring biofilm kinetics
Week 7

Assays
Various biofilm assays
3 modified E. coli plates and co-culture with wild-type (for testing of biofilm inhibition); 3 wild-type plates for eventual testing"

Derek
Derek is a first year student from Biochemistry undergraduate. He is interested in doing research and want to explore his strength on it.
Funny random things:
ohh did I use the wrong pipette?
Raul
Raul
Don't let Raul's severe-looking appearences and intimidating silence deceive you: he is the nicest guy on earth! As soon as he gets to know you, he will start taking care of you as if you were a little brother/sister! His great passions are biology, chemistry and all  that has to do with those fields (don't get him started on synthetic biology!!). His bright future defenitely lies within the walls of a lab!
Funny random things:
HE IS A PRO AT TERRIBLE KNOCK-KNOCK JOKES!!! (Don't ever let him tell you one; if you are a normal person, you'll probably remain traumatized for the rest of your life).
Astrid
Astrid
Astrid is currently in her 2nd year in HKUST, and studying Biochemistry and Cell Biology starting from this year. Astrid works in sub group 2 and mostly does the inoculation, which might be too many times until she got a new nickname, ""Inoculation girl""! Great, is it? For now, Astrid still has no clear plan at all after leaving UST, however she absolutely wants to go for further study or find something to do.
Funny random things:
** Astrid's sub group conversation. **

Carefully documented gene sequences we've found so far.  Looked more into best degradation tags to use.  Started learning how to verify sequencing results so we can look at sequencing data from our constructs made by the fab team.
Fabrication Team:
We were split into two teams to work autonomously on Miniprep procedure for plasmid DNA extraction and SalI and EcoRI restriction digests of mCherry and pDSRed.
Characterization Team:
Started imaging actual cells.  More work on parameter estimation problem and comparing algorithms.  Started looking for new parts in Registry.  More changes to GenoSIGHT GUI.
Week of 6/20/2011
Design Team:
More work on Prolog compiler (long and frustrating work).  Lots of troubleshooting with the fab team picking a better plasmid to use in E. coli Verified that our grammar implementation in GenoCAD is producing accurate DNA sequences for constructs.
Fabrication Team:
We compared the differences in protocol between the Yeast pYES2 vector and E. coli pDsRed vector and updates on Codon Optimization.
Characterization Team:
More imaging of cells from fab team.  More work on parameter estimation.  Started looking at adaptive imaging and timing.  Troubleshooting with Design Team.
Week of 6/27/2011
Design Team:
Added linker sequences and degradation tags to GenoCAD, along with plasmids.  Got compiler working - we can now make a construct in GenoCAD and generate a valid SBML file, which can be simulated in Matlab, etc.  Started writing iGEM safety proposal and project description.  Started adapting grammar to make a bigger variety of constructs.
Fabrication Team:
We worked on mCherry and mCitrine from pRSETb into pYES2 for yeast expression, and Biobrick ECFP (BBa_E0020) is being used as a test protein to validate our chosen backbone vector (pSB1AK3 with part J04500). We also worked on converting our existing fluorescent proteins into Biobrick parts in order to further test pSB1AK3.
Characterization Team:
More imaging and updates to GenoSIGHT GUI.  Starting to test parameter estimation against simulated data.

Going the extra Mile out of the Lab
Introduction
Bringing synthetic biology and the iGEM projects in contact with the public is a relevant part of the iGEM competition. In order to reach new interested groups, we were dedicated in many activities to spread our public outreach. Among other things we co-hosted the CeBiTec pupils academy , published a german homepage , presented our project at a scientific symposium and the public ceremony of NRW day 2016 , designed a postcard regarding synthetic biology and had close communication with media and press , including a successful crowdfunding campaign .
Our Projects
When communicating our project to a non scientific audience we discovered early in our project that not only our Evobody project but also synthetic biology are difficult to explain. The publicity seems to be biased towards genetical engineering and additionally our scientific approach is hard to understand. To overcome these difficulties we started several projects to improve our  communication and presentation skills and created tools to simplify the dialogue:
Pupils Academy
We experienced first misunderstandings when we had the chance to present our topic to the scientific staff of our institute in April. These general communication issues appeared once again when we had the chance to be instructors at the pupils academy in june."

③ CO2
Most chemical compounds with carbon produce a product through a synthetic-dissociation pathway. The decarboxylation, the dissociation of carbon, will lose carbon equivalent and limit the product’s theoretical carbon yield. The Formula 1 show you how to calculate the efficiency of a pathway.
We assume that non-oxidative glycolysis (NOG) as a model mechanism to develop our software program. NOG is one of the complete carbon yield pathways that starts with sugar to acetyl-CoA. It needs conjunction with carbon dioxide or assimilation with other one-carbon (C1) source to produce desirable fuels and chemicals (Bogorad I. W., Lin T. S., Liao J. C. 2013).
While simulating the NOG pathway, we achieved complete carbon yield. So without losing any of carbons, we are able to obtain desirable results. During the reaction, there are lots of chemicals that result in carbon loss. The program ‘Gil’ calculates the CO2 reduction to calculate the carbon loss. This is due to the fact that CO2 is less likely to be utilized unless it is fixed compared to other chemicals.

We were debating whether the society continues or stops the GM foods. One group of students was the affirmative side, and the other was negative side. Both groups showed great debating ability. It was an impressive and fun experience. This forum may make the public aware of the biotech applied in the society.
On November 1st, 2014, we visited the Academic Sinica, which is one of the top academic institutes in Taiwan. We look around the display of research achievement from labs that inspires us how biotech could be. And we also attended academic symposium, in which we discussed specific topic and expressed our idea.  Meanwhile, we went to scientific research lectures, which intrigues our motivation to learn more biotech approaches in the lab.
 
By the way, we met Dr. Woan-Yuh Tarn in Institute of Biomedical Sciences.  We discussed our project and she is interested in our idea. We acquired the materials for gene cloning from her lab. This visit in Sinica has a significant meaning for us and is also the beginning on our iGEM tour.
We visited iGEM team NTCU-Formosa and met a member, CHAO-DI CHANG to learn the approach about data mining. We also looked around their laboratory and the campus. We asked him about the tricks of searching the bacteria or the protein we need. He told us some useful web resources such as NCBI, UniProtKB and dbPTM. He introduced these webs to us and taught us how to use them and find the target we may need. Also, he showed us how to write a programming code to sort out the data we download. As for we, we told him the idea of our iGEM project and exchanged different ideas and experiences in the previous iGEM Jamboree."

Leaving for Banff
Today after classes we left for Banff . We had a poster presentation at the Banff conference center . Our team did well . We had a lot of traffic towards our side of the room. We set up 3 laptops to better show case our project: Second life , membrane computing and the wiki. Handouts were given .
TEAM
On the way to aGEM
After mass printing of handouts and posters, along with some final practice, our team headed over to the aGEM Jamboree held at the Banff Conference Center. The trip was fraught with folding of handouts and final edits to our official abstract, which was submitted to iGEM along with our final track choices.
Poster Session at aGEM
During the evening, we gave poster presentations at aGEM. We gave out handouts, spoke about the four main components of our project, and showed people how to both navigate our wiki and explore in Synthetic Biology Interactive. This was an extremely useful experience in practicing for the poster session at the actual jamboree.

ETH_Zurich,2012,Team:ETH Zurich#Interview2_-_-_TEXT.html,"iz auch wegen der Lebensqualität die sicher durch die Natur definiert ist und dort hat die Landwirtschaft einen grossen Einfluss. Die Bauern sind schliesslich am meisten betroffen von der Entscheidung, denn die Angst der Konsumenten schlägt sich sofort im Kaufverhalten nieder und das schadet den Bauern.
Q: Wir sehen, sie sind kein Fundamentalist. Aber sehen Sie von Ihrer Seite das Potential, beispielsweise in GMOs wie ""Golden Rice"", der Gentechnik?
A: Ja, ich glaube die Gentechnik hat ein sehr grosses Potential. Ich glaube aber wir müssen vorher alles ganz genau abklären. Wir sehen riesigen Herausforderungen entgegen, wie dem Klimawandel und der stetig wachsenden Bevölkerung. Wir werden irgendwann vielleicht angewiesen sein auf Pflanzen, die wenig Wasser benötigen. Aber in der Schweiz haben wir kein Hungerproblem, niemand kennt hier mehr das Problem wenn man Hunger hat. Das Potential ist sicher eher in der Dritten Welt.
Q: Glauben Sie auch, dass die negative Publicity, gerade auch von Monsanto, die Leute beeinflusst?
A: Sicher, wir Bauern haben zum Beispiel fast einen Heiligenschein. Alleine Wörter wie „Chemie“ oder „Gentechnik“ sind schon so negativ besetzt. Die Leute können sich einfach Skandale besser merken. Und einen negativen Ruf wird man auch nie mehr los.
Q: Warum denken sie, dass Gentechnik in den USA viel besser ankommt als hier in Europa?
A: Das ist natürlich ein Unterschied in der Kultur. Und gerade dadurch hat die USA sicher ein anderes Verständnis entwickelt als wir hier in Europa. Europäer sind wahrscheinlich viel sensibler und reagieren viel empfindlicher auf das, was sie lesen und hören.

1. Take e. coli that contains no target genes to Chl-  medium, coating evenly.
2. Take e. coli that contains no target genes to Chl+ medium, coating evenly.
3. Take e. coli that contains the after-enzyme-digestion plasmids to Chl+ medium, coating evenly.
4. Take e. coli that contains target genes to Chl+ medium, coating evenly.
After coating, incubate for around 16h.
After cultivating, observe the growth of e. coli in plate, pick out the colonies that we need to a liquid medium, then put it into the shaker in oscillation, oscillation for 12-16 hours.
9.Preparation of LB culture medium
We need to prepare 2 bottles of 200ml liquid medium and 2 bottles of 200ml solid medium.
1. Prepare 900ml liquid medium at first, according to the formula shown in Table 8.
2. Each take 200ml from the culture medium and put separately into four conical flask.
3. Label two bottles as solid culture medium, add respectively 3g agarose powder and vortex.
4. Seal four conical flasks with kraft paper and carry out high-pressure steam sterilization with culture dishes.
5. After sterilization, pour plate on the clean workbench, namely, pour the solid medium into Petri dishes, with about 10-15ml medium in each dish.
6. Preparation of 5 plates without chloramphenicol and 15 plates containing chloramphenicol (35 µg/ µL) tablet.
10. Plasmid purification
Procedure
After the multiplication of e. coli , we need to extract the plasmid in e. coli, the purification procedure is as follows:
1. Transfer the medium that in the test tube into the corresponding centrifugal tube, fill and cover the tube to centrifuge at 12000×g for 2 min.
2. Discard the supernatant fluid carefully.
3. Fill in the centrifugal pipe, centrifuge and discard repeatedly until the medium finished. At this time, there is bacteria depositing at the bottom of the centrifuge tube, so the following operation is as follows:
1. Add in 250µL Buffer S1 (dangling sample) and vortex until the precipitation disappears(a confirmation of having added RNase A in the Buffer S1).
2. Add in 250µ"
BioIQS-Barcelona,2018,Team:BioIQS-Barcelona#Wiki editing_-_-_TEXT.html," IFrame
Mediawiki templates are very useful to introduce elements which are present in multiple pages of our wiki, like the navigation bar and the footer.
In addition, the stylesheets and scripts of the wiki can be added to this templates.
This way, the wiki will load faster after accessing it for a first time, as the stylesheet and scripts of all the pages will already be loaded in the templates.
This behaviour can be simulated locally using IFrame. This will have to be removed when uploading the wiki to the iGEM server. However, their use facilitates the local design of the wiki and makes it more similar to how the wiki will have to look like once uploaded to the iGEM server.
A commented example: complete project description and team member pages
In this tutorial you will see two example pages that could be perfectly valid for the iGEM wiki.
The first one is the project description team and serves as a good example to see how editing Bootstrap from Sass is an easy way to have a simple, elegant and personalized wiki design.
The second one is the team members page, which demonstrates how Bootstrap can also be used to create elaborated and responsive wiki pages in a smart way. This examples also serve as a clarification of all the concepts explained so far as they both make use of IFrame to represent the Mediawiki templates.
Setting up the iGEM wiki to upload the local code
iGEM already provides the teams with a default wiki style.
This style can be perfectly used to fully document the iGEM projects in a wiki and fulfill the most important objective of the wiki derivable.
However, most teams style their wikis in a different way to create a distinctive look for their project.
Hence, the first step is removing the default wiki styles to upload the personalized ones.
In this tutorial you will learn how to do so and how to start uploading the content of our wiki.
Uploading the local wiki to the iGEM wiki server
After learning how to edit the wiki from the very beginning and how to adapt it to the required iGEM format, it is time to upload the local wiki to the iGEM wiki server to make it public.
However, it is not as immediate as it may seem. In this tutorial, you will learn how to adapt the local version of the wiki to the iGEM wiki server, how to upload the stylesheet and script files and how to adapt your wiki to revert some styles from load.php that are applied by default.
Finally, you will have your local wiki uploaded to the iGEM server so that everybody can learn from your"

July
Week 1
This week, we received our IDT order; this contained chitinase A and B from Serratia marcescens GEI strain. The chitinases were optimized for BioBrick use, as is described in their respective BioBrick pages: chiA and chiB . Initially, I tried to do a PCR to amplify the synthetic genes, but this resulted in a too small product for chiB (Figure 1). The PCR was done with Q5 polymerase and the program from Table 1 was used.

This did not work, so I also tried raising the annealing temperature to 70 degrees Celsius, diluting the templates to 1 ng/μL. That failed as well, so a gradient PCR was performed with OneTaq and 2% DMSO(see Figure 2).

Set up an overnight culture of bacteria in a culture tube, with 5mL of LB, plus the appropriate antibiotics. Incubate  in a shaking incubator at  37oC overnight.
Measure the OD600 of the resuspended bacteria culture. Aliquot appropriate volume so that starting OD for each tube is  0.4, shake in the 37oC incubator for approximately 30 minutes.
Set up five fresh and labelled 1.5μl microcentrifuge tubes. To each tube, add 20μl of each lactate concentration (0 M, 10-3 M, 10-2 M)  and 180μl of the diluted bacteria sample to make up 200μl of reaction mix. To the remaining two tubes, add 40μl of each cell supernatant (Hela and HepG2) and 10μl of the diluted bacteria sample to make 160μl of reaction mix, with 5x dilution of the samples.
Incubate in a shaking  incubator at  37oC incubator for 3 to 4 hours.
Add 5μl of each sample onto the appropriately labelled polylysine slide and cover with the slip and capture images using NIS microscope.
We found that different lactate concentration in the media or HeLa/HepG2’s supernatant induce different level of GFP expression. RIOT sensor 10 appeared to be the most sensitive sensor to lactate.
Materials: harvest supernatants of HeLa and HepG2 as shown in Milestone 10 and overnight culture of bacteria

We have registered our team.
We have completed the Judging form.
We have set up our wiki.
We have prepared our poster and presentation and we are ready to present them in the Asia Jamboree.
We have designed and constructed six novel standard BioBrick Parts which were used in our project. All our standard BioBrick Parts have been submitted to the iGEM Registry before the deadline. The quantitative data indicating the functions and characteristics of these parts are shown in our wiki to make them applicable to other teams.
We have tested our standard BioBrick Parts in our project with specific experiments, from which we have got qualitative and quantitative results. These BioBricks of our own design and construction work as expected according to the experimental validation. The data and results are accessible in our wiki.
We have documented the characterization of our standard BioBrick Parts in the “Main Page” section of the Part’s/Device’s Registry entry. We have submitted one regulatory part (BBa_K1024000), one reporter part (BBa_K1024001), and four signaling parts (BBa_K1024002, BBa_K1024003, BBa_K1024004, & BBa_K1024005).
We have submitted our novel standard BioBrick Parts to the iGEM Parts Registry and the submissions adhere to the iGEM Registry guidelines.
We have taken the implications for the environment, security, safety, ethics, and sharing into consideration in the design and execution of our project. The aim of our project is constructing a novel portable system to detect pathogens with the principles of synthetic biology, which indicates that our system is supposed to be safe to potential patients, easy for usage and sharing, friendly to the environment, and acceptable for ethical issues. We choose S. cerevisiae (Yeast) as the host for our system instead of E. coli or other bacteria because yeast is widely used in food and drink manufacturing, which means that yeast is fundamentally friendlier to human health than other microorganisms"

Building Blocks: Large DNA/Genome assembly made easy!
Overview
The Johns Hopkins University Build a Genome team has proposed a new standard, RFC 38 , for the construction and assembly of large DNA. The physical assembly of standard parts is currently a non-standard process, which can either come from direct genome PCR with restriction enzyme sites incorporated into the PCR primers, or overlap assembly PCR. Furthermore, current Biobrick construction standards [RFC10, RFC11,RFC12 etc.] rely heavily on restriction enzyme based methods, which can be sequence, cost and time restrictive. This is especially true of large DNA assembly, where 100% control of over DNA sequence may be mandatory, such as in whole genome assembly. We propose a novel standard, The Building Block Method, for both the construction of standard parts and their assembly
This Building Block standard can be either:
Interchangeable
Non-interchangeable format, based on the desired use of the part.
What is a Building Block?
A Standard Build Block is a ~750 base pair sequence of DNA that is composed of annotated biological parts. This particular size represents a “sweet spot” for a currently optimized set of efficient assembly techniques (e.g. high accuracy sequencing in a single run) but need not be fixed in stone. The Building Block, however, may not be composed entirely of single biological parts (as in BioBricks) and the junction with neighboring Building Blocks may be essential for biological for function.
A Composite Building Block is composed of two or more Building Blocks. Composite Building Blocks may be constructed from non-interchangeable Building Blocks or interchangeable Building Blocks.
Standard Assembly
Building blocks are assembled using (Uracil Specific Excision Reagent) USER reaction assembly, which relies on a uracil base within the end of the Building Block DNA. Both 5’ ends of Building blocks must conform to the extremely degenerate consensus sequence of A{Nx}T in which x= 3,5,7,9 or 11. There are no other sequence requirements. The"

This ligated product was transformed in E. coli DH5α. Many red colonies were seen the next day, which indicated self-ligation. Other colonies were screened and found to be negative.
Week 21: All about ychH promoter!
The primers for ychH promoter arrived. We carried out PCR using Pfu,  Phusion and Taq of which Taq gave the best results.(Correct sizes of the PCR products ~300 bp were confirmed using agarose gel electrophoresis). We set up more PCR reactions of the promoter using Taq. PCR products were gel purified and digested with EcoRI and PstI. The linearized plasmid backbone was also digested with EcoRI and PstI. Both pSB1C3 and ychH promoter were ligated in 1:3 molar ratio respectively. Ligated product was transformed the next day in E. coli DH5α. Eight colonies of transformants were randomly picked and inoculated in LB+Kanamycin. All were miniprepped the next day and screened for positives using PCR.
Week 22: Our part is ready!
Screening results for all eight colonies were positive!

Application: Wastewater Treatment Methods
    Wastewater treatment is a growing concern for municipalities across the globe. This multistage process is resource intensive and effective methods are in demand as water consumption increases. Biological treatment of wastewater is in use today and largely targets organic compounds. Research shows clear improvements with the use of co-cultures. For example, a microalgae and bacteria co-culture requires lower inputs of oxygen and other chemicals to undergo the denitrification process. A potential challenge arises due to the unpredictable content of wastewater: the co-culture treatment stage must be included after enough processing has occured to reasonably know the contents of the wastewater. It is essential that population ratios are maintained between organisms; if a step in the treatment process were to fail, contamination of further stages and the environment may occur, defeating the purpose of wastewater treatment. Our project provides a stable yet adjustable ratio of organisms, which could enable further research and development of wastewater treatment co-cultures and ultimately improve treatment processes and human environmental impact.

Procedure and Results
In order to construct the two modules of the epigenetic toggle switch, we have used tools like the plasmids pF6a-MX6-Kan-Purg-GFP and pREP41X already available. These plasmids will be modified to introduce into them the epigenetic control elements. For further information, please read Epigenetic Flip Flop Notebook .
Figure 1. The assembly process of the reporter module involved two cloning steps: first,  insertion of adh1 transcriptional terminator plus two tetracycline repeats (Tadh1-tetO2) upstream of urg1 promoter, using the BglII restriction site, and second, insertion of the reporter gene plus T adh1 plus four tetracycline repeats plus actin transcriptional terminator (GFP-Tadh1-tetO4-Tact1) downstream of urg1 promoter, using  PacI/AscI sites. The composite parts were obtained by a DNA synthesis.

Introduction
In this section you will find out what is Catalytic Activity Sequencing (CAT-Seq). Firstly, the CAT-Seq is introduced in brief to give a quick overview of how the system works and what are the different parts it consists of. Next, every step of the system is described and illustrated in detail. Finally, we show how we have applied this design in order to build the proof of concept of CAT-Seq.
It should be noted that only the final form of the system design is described here. Yet, the design of a new method is a highly dynamic process which requires an immense amount of theoretical and practical iterations that closely follow the main principles of engineering. Therefore, in order to see the CAT-Seq system engineering story - how it began, how early designs have looked, how and why did the system design change during the whole project year and what influenced those changes - please head to the Human Practices section!
CAT-Seq allows to rapidly record the information about billions catalytic biomolecule activities in parallel. Each measured activity is then simultaneously written into DNA sequence encoding the particular biomolecule. After the recording, both the biomolecule sequence and it’s activity can be read using nanopore sequencing.
Currently, droplet microfluidics offer an efficient and high-throughput way to parallelise high number of reactions. As each molecule is encapsulated in a unique water droplet, various physically separated reactions can be carried out at the same time. Yet, what is missing, is a way to record the activity information in each droplet, so that after the droplets are collected together and broken, the sequence and function relationship is not lost. In other words, the main goal of CAT-Seq is to connect catalytic biomolecule’s phenotype to genotype in ultra-high throughput manner.
During the theoretical design phase it became apparent that recording such"
Imperial,2014,Team:Imperial#Water Report_-_-_TEXT.html," 200,000 residencies, 500 parks and 250 schools are irrigated by reclaimed water. St. Petersburg, FL is home to one of the largest dual distribution systems in the world, operating since the 70’s it provides water for landscape irrigation for cooling and other industrial applications. The state also reuses water for agricultural irrigation. The Water Conserv II project irrigates 3,000 acres of citrus orchard every year. Reused water provides great advantages for the growers, containing the correct amounts of boron and phosphorous to give optimum soil pH.
Considerations
Wastewater treatment and recycling can be challenging and controversial to implement. From a survey of industry experts by the Global Water Research Coalition, Miller (2005) describes “key factors of success” to be considered in design and implementation of water recycling systems. These include:
A particularly clear definition of the project objectives and limitations.
Cost competitive pricing. Recycled water must be carefully priced to be viewed as a viable alternative. Cheaper, more efficient technologies in water recycling are desperately needed.
Chemical and microbiological safety. It is important to have technologies that ensure the removal of chemical contaminants, particularly endocrine disruptors such as pesticides, heavy metals and pharmaceuticals and removal or inactivation of microbiological pathogens. Water utilities must be able to reassure the public that the recycled water is completely safe for its intended use.
Public perception and acceptance. While the public is generally accepting of recycled water as a mean for landscape irrigation, for potable use, reactions are more negative.
Improving Public Acceptance
Many studies have charted the perception and acceptance of recycled water over the years (Bruvold and Ward 1970; Bruvold 1972, 1979 and 1988, Nancarrow 2003, Dolnicar and Schäfer 2006, 2007 and 2009; Dolnicar and Hurlimann 2010; Hurlimann and Dolnicar 2010). Whilst levels of acceptance vary with time and location a few conclusions are consistently drawn:
In general, public knowledge on the subject of water treatment and the advantages and disadvantages of different processes is relatively low.
General perception of recycled water is that, whilst it is an environmentally friendly solution, there are public health concerns.
Recycled water is considered acceptable for tasks such as gardening and car washing. When it comes to close body use (bathing and showering) there are reservations due to fears of residual wastewater in the recycled water.
Perception is very dependant on the particular source and treatment of the water.

Criteria 3: Outline and detail a new approach to an issue of Human Practice in synthetic biology as it relates to your project, such as safety, security, ethics, or ownership, sharing, and innovation. Through a survey of over 380 iGEM community members, we identified intellectual property as an issue that impacts the work of the majority of the iGEM community. To address this, we engaged with patent agents and IP experts to create an iGEM-specific patent guide to act as a primer that can be used to help iGEMers navigate intellectual property issues.
Eligibility for Special PrizesBest Human Practice Advance:IP survey and guide: We designed and administered an intellectual property survey to gather high impact data from more than 300 members of the iGEM community. The information was useful to other iGEMers, such as Team INSA Lyon who cited the majority of our data for their human practices. Our team also engaged people outside of the iGEM community, such as a patent agent, the University of British Columbia University-Industry Liaison Office and other technical experts.  The end result, with use of feedback from experts and other iGEM teams, was an intellectual property guide geared specifically towards the iGEM community.Assessing the industrial relevance of our research: We went to the Chevron refinery in Burnaby, British Columbia and talked to an industry professional about the processes and costs pertinent to our project. We also communicated with Alberta Innovates – Technology Futures (AITF) and Oil Sands Leadership Initiative (OSLI) to discuss the progress of our project and obtain some industrial insights .Best Model:Consortia Model: To model the population dynamics of our engineered consortia, we used a lot primary wet lab data to improve the accuracy.  Our model improves on the two-organism consortia model found in literature by simulating the significantly more complex synthetic three-organism community, which has not yet been done to our knowledge. Furthermore, our model was designed to be easily adaptable to predict any limiting-substrate interdependent consortia population dynamics in general.Pathway Model: Our distributed pathway model streamlines and informs future consortia project planning. Our model explained experimental observations found in literature of synergistic pathways in consortia and demonstrated that distributed metabolisms, like the one we are engineering, occur in nature. This model helps investigators probe for possible new metabolisms derived"
