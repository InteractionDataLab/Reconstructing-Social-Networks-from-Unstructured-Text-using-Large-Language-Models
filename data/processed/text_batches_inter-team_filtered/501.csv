For preparation of BBMVs from Varroa destructor, 15-20 Varroa mites were placed in a 2mL eppendorf tube and stored at -80⁰C.
During the following steps, the samples were kept on ice as much as possible. 250µL of homogenization buffer (200mM mannitol, 10mM ascorbic acid, 5mM EDTA, 10 mM HEPES, 1% HEPES, 2 tablets/100mL cOmpleteTM protease inhibitor cocktail tablets, 2 mM DTT pH 7.4) was added to the frozen samples. Hereafter followed grinding of the samples with a glass rod. Additionally, the samples were sonicated for 10 seconds at 50W. After addition of 250 µL of 24 mM MgCl2, the samples were incubated for 10 minutes on ice. Afterwards, the samples were centrifuged for 10 minutes at 6000xg at 4⁰C. The supernatant was further centrifuged for 35 minutes at 21130xg at 4⁰C. The supernatant was discarded and the pellet was resolved in 30 µL solution buffer (200 mM mannitol, 1 mM HEPES, 1 mM Tris, 1 mM DTT pH 7.4). The samples, now containing brush border membrane vesicles, were stored at -80⁰C until further use.

To run the script, you will need to open terminal or command prompt on your computer.  For windows, press Windows+R, and then type “cmd” into the run bar, and hit enter.  On mac, hit Command+Space, type “terminal” and then hit enter.  This should open a command line interface in which the program can be run.
Commands are input into the program in the following format:
python seq_analyzer.py -if sequence_file -m (g)ibson/(p)rotoptimization -c organism_codon_file -o output_file -t speed
in which the arguments are:
-if = input filename, note the input file should be in the same directory
-m = mode, p for protein optimization, and g for gibson primer design
-c = organism codon frequency usage
-o = output filename
-t = speed at which you want to run the program–a larger number is 0.
The required arguments are -if, -m, and -c.  If no output filename is designated, the output file will be named after the input file with “.output” concatenated on the end.  if no speed is designated, the default speed is 1 second between each step.
Example:
python seq_analyzer.py -if sequence_file -m g -c ecoli -o output -t 10
python seq_analyzer.py -if sequence_file -m g -c ecoli 10
Both commands above do the same thing, except the first command designates an output file called output and makes the operation run at 10 seconds between each step.
The script will then run and depending on the operation selected ask for appropriate user input and at the end output a text file with the results.
Sequence processing
When running the protein optimization module, the program will process each sequence individually.  For each sequence, the program will convert the sequence to its codon optimized DNA form (for amino acid sequences, it will convert it directly to an optimized DNA sequence; for DNA sequences, it will convert it into an amino acid sequence to verify length, and then conver it to an optimized DNA sequence).
Each sequence will then be scanned for restriction sites–if a restriction site is found, the program will isolate that area, and iterate over optimal codons until it finds an iteration that does not contain any restriction sites.  This newly optimized area will then replace the original code.

Valencia Biocampus BioBrick Characterisation
In the spirit of iGEM, we have collaborated with the Valencia Biocampus team and characterised several of the BioBricks they made as part of their 'Talking Life' project.C. freundii and E. coli JM109 cells were transformed with the following three plasmids and the transformations were plated onto LB + chloramphenicol plates.
Bac2
Plasmid construction: groE promoter + AsRed2. This promoter is activated after a heat shock (keeping cells in a 44°C waterbath for 5 minutes), as it normally controls the expression of groE, a heat shock protein that helps degrade proteins that have misfolded due to the high temperature.
Method (expand)
Colonies were picked from the Citrobacter plate and inoculated into 3ml LB liquid medium + chloramphenicol40 (1μl/ml) and grown overnight at 37°C on a shaker. The following day, the ODs were measured and a normalized amount of these cultures was used to inoculate bottles of M9 minimal medium (containing glucose as a carbon source) and left to grow at 37°C until the"

UCL,2013,Team:UCL PG#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," the ability of each fluorescent protein to give out dependable quantitative data at tiny scale which is exactly the scale which most molecular experiments are done. pCSTA.mKeima displayed a clear and smooth trends of glucose dependency. Following that mRFP also showed relevant dependency but the data is more unstable. However, eGFP is found to be very inappropriate to indicate pCSTA's dependency on glucose concentration. Firstly, the graph shape is distorted. Secondly, it is believed that there is a high autofluorescence background from bacteria itself, seriously increased the fluorescent readouts to a false reading of 20 folds higher compared to mKeima and mRFP.
Attenuation Model
To understand the effect of attenuation of light across culture media or living tissue, we modeled a system based on Beer-Lambert law.
Effective Separation of Genetic Event
eGFP and mRFP have considerable  spectral emission overlap and require  post-acquisition compensation to distinguish them. Although eGFP and mKeima are both excited using the blue laser, there is considerable separation in their emission spectra allowing easy separation. Furthermore, mRFP and mKeima can be effectively distinguished from each other using different excitation lasers.
Evolution of mKeima
Work under progress ;D
Lab
Ethidium bromide (carcinogenic chemical) is used during gel electrophoresis to visualize the DNA. A designated EtBr work area is allocated in the lab for EtBr works only so that it does not contaminate other lab equipment possibly touched with bare hands. The EtBr liquid waste is incubated with green bag kit before disposal.
Machines like platereader and cell sorters are operated under supervision of trained personnel.
PPE is always worn in the lab without exception.
Environment
Lab waste containing cells are disposed in yellow bags and ultimately incinerated. The purpose is to ensure to antibiotics resistance bacteria from lab escape to wild nature.
We always recycle our pipette tip racks :D

Despite being under the control of pLac, their immunity proved somewhat independent of IPTG, as both un-induced and induced cells prove immune. In addition, we had some strange toxicity assay results, partially resolved by the explanation of colicin E2 contamination.

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Experiments_-_-_TEXT.html," is able to provide relatively accurate information while the cost is lower than most ammonia detection equipment on the market. The user only needs to fix our equipment on a buoy or a platform, and to purify the water when receiving the text message that the device automatically sends to him/her.
Demand
As we have demonstrated, excessive ammonia in the fish pond is one of the main problems that limited the development of fresh water aquaculture. Excessive ammonia will lead to the deterioration of water quality and effect the taste of the fish. It will also lead to the outbreak of fish diseases and cause fish death, heavily decreasing the yield of the fish pond. If we cannot solve the problem of excessive ammonia, it will be problematic to increase the breeding density and to improve the fish quality, thus effecting the income of fish farmers.
So essential as the problem of excessive ammonia is, there are certain solutions fish farmers will apply empirically. During the high-risk period, fish farmers will frequently visit their ponds and observe the water quality and fish conditions. Once there is any manifestation indicting excessive ammonia or fish diseases, they will take emergency measures such as disinfecting the pond and changing pond water.
Given the fact that fish farmers are judging by virtue of experience, there will always be deviation. When any manifestation occurs, excessive ammonia has actually erupted already. Although there are some products of ammonia detection on the market, they are either too expensive for fish farmers to afford or inconvenient to use (See more details on products comparison in entrepreneurship ). In addition, they measures they usually take to deal with excessive ammonia are either too expensive or too troublesome. According to our research (See more details on Integrated HP), big aquaculture companies usually choose running water to breed fish, which, in places lack of surface water, will cost up to 200 thousand yuan per month and waste thousands tons of underground water. Self-employed fish pond tend to choose chemical agents to remove ammonia, but this method is not efficient enough and is not eco-friendly.
Therefore, an effective, convenient and cheap way to detect and degrade ammonia is in strong demand of fish farmers.
Design
Based on the principle of efficiency, convenience and economy, we designed a device to detect the ammonia concentration in the fish pond with the application of our engineered bacteria and introduced another strain of engineered E. coli to covert ammonia in the pond water to nitrogen or uric acid precipitation.
By introducing bacteria into the sensing system can reduce the cost of detection components. Our engineered bacteria will express RFP when the ammonia concentration is below the threshold. When the ammonia concentration exceeds the safe value, our bacteria will stop expressing RFP."

5th CCiC
The 5th Conference of China iGEMer Community (2018 CCiC)  was one of them. This year, it was held by ShanghaiTech University in 8.28-31. We delivered a formal presentation and explaining our projects in front of other teams both on the stage and by the poster exhibition. Judges also provided us with ideas on the demonstration of our project. We also communicated with other teams, exchanged our ideas about projects and posters design, and helped other teams deal with bottlenecks. We had great fun in CCiC!

Attendance to Meet Ups
The meets ups bring several advantages to the teams. It is one of the simplest ways to reach a greater number of people to whom you can explain your project. And therefore they allow you to know first-hand the projects of the rest of the teams so that you can consult and clarify doubts. These meetings also allow for more related and powerful collaborations thanks to knowing the rest of the teams in person. And last but not least, they allow you to practice exposing your project with a view to improving in the Giant Jamboree.
Our team attended two meet ups that took place in the month of August.
Marseille
Mediterranean Meet Up (Marseille)
This meet up took place between Thursday 9 and Friday 10 August in the city of Marseille and was organized by the team of this city, the Aix-Marseille. In it, all the teams from the Mediterranean area were summoned, so they ended up attending both France and Spain. Francisco, Gonzalo and Ivan attended this meet up on behalf of the team.
The event began with a reception in which all teams had their first informal contact. Subsequently, a 5 minutes presentation of each of the projects was organized, summarizing the concept on which the proyect was based, the work carried out and the plans to complete it. After the exhibition, each team answered the questions that could have the jury and the rest of the teams.
Later they invited us to a joint meal. In the afternoon it was organized a sightseeing tour of the city, but due to inclement weather it had to be suspended, although we could enjoy a pleasant evening of board games and conversations with the rest of the teams. At night"
Panama,2010,Team:Panama#Team#students_-_-_TEXT.html,"GEM venture. This keeps me in the lab A LOT but I enjoy it very much. A few of the things that I do to blow off steam is sing (not only in the shower) because it helps me concentrate and make an otherwise bad day into a less stressful one. I absolutely enjoy the times when my best friend and I go out to have nice meals, as my grandmother used to say ""Eating is the only thing that we bring with us when we go back to mother earth."" A little hippie, I know. Finally, hanging out with my friends from the lab is one the things that I very much enjoy. When we are all together, we have a really hard time keeping a straight face. That's good.
The iGEM Experience: When I first learned about this, I had no idea what it was all about. Once it was all clear, let's get to work. All of the work done at the lab have all been worth it in order to come up with something that would help the world in some way, something that would further solidify Panama's position on the world map of research; a position that has been and continues to be nurtured by the best.  I hope that everyone enjoys learning about our rhamnolipid project as much as we have enjoyed concieving and producing it.
Research Interests: Sometimes I feel that I should know by now what is it that I want to invest the rest of my life doing, but being in biotechnology has taught me so much in so many areas that sometimes it's hard for me to make up my mind! I've always wanted to know what makes things tick (bacterias, viruses, parasites, etc.), with a little bit of that knowledge, I can try to find better ways for them to tick or, stop them from ticking (only if it's a bad tick). For my immediate future, I'm very interested in pursuing a doctorate degree in Pharmaceutical biotechnology.

Click the button to go to the screenshot images!
The button links to a pdf which shows 4 screenshots of further examination of ""gene_678"", which was found to be a potential Cry protein.
Image 1) shows the BLAST result from this gene against the nr database proteinThe Non-Redundant (nr) contains non redundant sequences from GenBank translations (i.e. GenPept) together with sequences from other databanks (Refseq, PDB, SwissProt, PIR and PRF). . The conserved domains shown are the OrfB_IS605 superfamily and the Cysteine rich_CPCC domain. Neither of these are known to have a functional characterization. The main hits belong to a class of genes known as transposases, which are known to move, and bind to, Transposons A transposon is a DNA sequence that can change its position within a genome. However, this domain corresponds only to the first 77% of the gene sequence. The remaining 23% requires further investigation.
Image 2) shows the BLAST result from the remaining 23% of the gene sequence against the nr protein database (in this image named “Protein Sequence (71 letters)”). The sequence shows similarity to known membrane proteins. Cry proteins are known to interact with the membrane to form the pores needed to kill their target.
Image 3) shows the output of the ""Coils"" expasy tool 4 , used to examine the secondary structure of the Cry2Ab8 protein. This image shows that there are probably some coils around the 100 amino acid area.
Image 4) shows the output of the ""Coils"" expasy tool 4 , used to examine the secondary structure of the protein resulting from ""gene 678"". This image shows that there may be some coils at the start of the protein.
The other 3 proteins show similar patterns and as such were all picked up by the pipeline. Given this we suggest these proteins would be prime candidates for further experimental validation.

The whole buzz took place in August 1st 2014, Brazilian teams participating in IGEM competition decided to hold a meeting to introduce their projects, discuss new ideas and strategies, assist in the development of projects and clarify general doubts regarding competition.
The meeting was so constructive! All projects were very interesting, it was very nice to see that all teams have the same day-by-day difficulties in lab, and in other to overcome these barriers, we exchanged tips and protocols. Another really cool part was hearing from different teams brilliant opinions on each project and see that each team had a little to add on other projects, making the small failures easier to be resolved. Anyway the meeting was super relaxing and constructive just like IGEM way of being! And to finish with a flourish, we played many games, accompanied by beer and fries. :)

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html," light bead were checked. And we conducted experiments to simulate the expected working condition of our hardware, to inquiry whether it functions well when floating in the ponds.
Filter membrane
To test the effect of the filter membrane, 2mL bacterial suspension flew pass the pump, and the absorbance at OD600 was tested by a spectrophotometer. LB medium was test as control group. And for each type of membrane we repeated for 3 times.(MEASURE-2/3)

In the experiment we found that parafilm is not strong enough to seal the joint. In the third test for 0.22μm membrane, some liquid leak from the gap and flow into the collection tube, making the outcome rather strange.
Considering that we will applied immobilized bacteria for application, which means there will be quite rare bacteria in the water after detection process, we believe it is reasonable to applied a 0.45μm filter membrane once we solve the leakage problem.
Pumps
For pumping water into and out the detecting cell, we chose two Kamoer peristaltic pumps NKP-DE-S04. We measured that, when powered by Arduino Nano (5V output), the voltage across the pump is 5.40V, while the current intensity is 0.22A. (pic1.pump v/pic2.pump a)
Also we measured the pumping speed under the same condition. Pumping 50mL water cost 3’54’’ on average, and it means the pump should work approximately 7 seconds each time to pump 1.5-2mL water, filling the detecting cell.
Another flow velocity experiment was conducted using 0.45μm and 0.22μm filter membrane. Different membranes were installed at the end of pump pipe and the joint was sealed with parafilm. It took 3’41’’ for 50mL water to flow past the 0.45μm membrane and 3’35’’ for 0.22μm membrane. (MEASURE-1)

“The Mighty Bacteria Against Dengue”
Social
Why we chose São Carlos 8
São Carlos’s city, which has 238,950 citizens (SOURCE: IBGE 2015) in the interior of the Brazilian State of São Paulo, was affected by dengue epidemic during the summer, between January and May, situation that have been getting worse by the years.
To justify the importance and necessity of the non-toxic repellent development and also to awareness about means of disease preventions, we seek to intervene in a social and educative way in a needy local community, owner of characteristics which       propitiate the disease occurrence.
Figure 1: Neighborhood São Carlos 8
The chosen neighborhood was São Carlos 8, a place where exists a large trashy accumulation on the streets that enable the water accumulation and, consequently, a huge proliferation of mosquitoes, directly affecting the population quality of life. It is one of the regions most affected by dengue disease in the city of São Carlos
Activity in São Carlos 8
Our target was to reach and affect youth with the development of a breakthrough activity that goes out of our lab benches and takes us to improve our artistic skills! Come check us out and have fun!
Figure 2: The scenario of our play.
In 2015, Brazil faced a dengue epidemic, and São Carlos was not different (Wiki link). Despite the campaigns to encourage people to take action for disease prevention (which mainly consists in eliminating sites with accumulated water, where Aedes       aegypti mosquitoes can reproduce), this effort is ineffective in combating the disease. So, we had the insight to contribute to awareness of local population, showing that there are people working on developing alternative (and possibly more effective)       solutions to this problem.
Dengue is an urban disease and capable of reaching all social classes. Although wealthy neighborhoods have less mosquitoes breeding grounds and richest population has access to improved health services, São Carlos was ravaged by the disease as a whole.
Our first step was to contact social entrepreneurship projects at UFSCar"

Bacteria mimic/Living vaccine project
Our living vaccine has three major components:
The Wolbachia surface protein (WSP), which will allow our bacteria to be transferred vertically (parent to offspring) by binding/interacting with the oocytes of the female insects and it also helps temper its immune reaction.
The Lyme bacteria Outer Surface protein (OspA), which specifically binds the TROSPA receptor in the gut of the tick and it is indispensable for the Lyme bacteria colonization. OspA will help our bacteria colonize the gut of the insect and in that way the Lyme bacteria will not be able to get established, therefore rendering it harmless.
A color indicator: GFP or RFP which will let scientist identify our ""living vaccine"" in the natural environment.
Most current solutions to prevent insect born diseases are pesticides, or physical barriers for individuals that maybe in contact with those insects. It is almost a loosing battle since the insects quickly develop resistance to those pesticides. Our solution does not focus on the insects but on the pathogen itself. We believe that for a pathogen to be effective, it first needs to get established in the insect, our bacteria will simulate the mechanism by which those pathogens colonize the insect preventing the initial infection in the first place. Another advantage is that if the bacteria loses the vector it will not be able to survive inside the insect and it will get lost."

Jianyi HUANG
If ONLY I’m a MATH MAJOR!!!
Jianyi is a junior majoring in biology and minoring in mathematics.
This is the second year that she has been on UCAS iGEM team and also the second year that UCAS has joined iGEM community. She likes playing with DNA fragments and create something interesting out of basic elements.Unfortunately, she always regrets she hadn’t become a math major, especially when tons of data drove her mad. The good thing is that she would be happy with everything as long as she could stay in lab.
As a second-year iGEMer, she organized group meetings and trainings of new team members in the first stage. Responsible for our DEGRADATION MODULE, she devoted most of her time in lab.
She is also fluent in English and wrote the PROJECT part of our wiki. She plays the guitar and doesn’t talk much.
Jingnan YE
Easily pissed off when just getting up
Jingnan is a junior double majoring in biology and material sciences and engineering at UCAS.
She sincerely appreciates her excellent teammates and awesome instructors working and learning with her during this enjoyable year, from which she discovered more about what she hates and will never try in her future research.
She spent most of her time in the lab and on her way to the lab, while successfully spared some time to arrange a couple of HP activities and do some paperwork.
Outside the lab she is also a music lover, a pop dancer and an amateur bodybuilder. She believes exposing herself to music and art can help her keep good mood when the experiment fails again, and regular exercise can keep her working in the lab for more than 15 hours without feeling exhausted.
Jiang WU
Crazy fan of Arya Stark
Jiang who wants to study alchemy is a sophomore majoring in chemistry at UCAS.
Though sufferring the frustrating failures which shouldn’t have been experienced at his age, he learned a lot and knew better about synthetic biology. Through all this one-year journey, he confirmed his ideal again to attempt establishing the biological world based on axiom system.
Making a plan, doing experiments and fail and planning again. Following this circle and eventually gained payback.
He is a chemist with an artistic heart, deeply attracted by CS and mathematics and has a final"

British_Columbia,2012,Team:British Columbia#Patent_-_-_TEXT.html,". Respondents thought that a brief guide can get them a good amount of the way to their goal, and this reinforced our motivation to produce such a guide. It is interesting to note how many respondents want to be patent lawyers.
This check-box poll confirmed our suspicions that a FAQ-style guide was the way to go. We likely lead the respondents to that conclusion. We didn't claim to be perfect social scientists. What's a little push-polling between friends?
Reinforcing that we aren't perfect social scientists, this question should have forced the respondent to make a choice. ""Both"" is an easy no-thought choice that damages what we intended to learn from the question. Regardless, we still learned that respondents are generally enthusiastic to learn about both sides of patents.
Patent Knowledge
Our research for the FAQ turned up a ballpark figure $US30,000 for a biotech patent in the United States.  Accordingly, it seems like the median respondent is underestimating the cost of a patent by a decimal place or two.
We turned up a ballpark number for this too. Three to six years is a typical length of time for the patent process to go from initial application, through prosecution, to issuance.
We suspect you'll notice a theme when we tell you we found out about this too. The Patent Cooperation Treaty gives an applicant 18 months after their first application in a participating country to apply for patents in other participating countries. These applications in the other participating countries will have an effective filing date of the first application.
Intellectual Property & Current Projects
This check-box poll illustrates that iGEM participants are reasonably resourceful when they start thinking about applying for IP protection. The majority of people have chosen to use the internet to gather information.  This was what we had expected.  This may explain why learning about IP for iGEM is such a big concern.  The world of IP is vast, ever-changing, and often ambiguous.  The internet, as a result, contains a sea of information that tends to overwhelm people new to IP.  Like us, many might like for someone to pick and choose the relevant information instead of sifting through everything themselves.
As you can see, a large part of the survey-takers don't know if they want to apply for a patent.  This is interest because we can start to ask why.  Have they just never given IP much thought, or do they not know enough about it to even consider applying? Either way, it shows that iGEMers need to pay more attention to IP issues.  As for the other results, like expected,"

Experiment & Results
Experiment
Protocols:
Experiments:
We transfect HEK-293 human cells with our plasmid constructions as described in the form [ref: table]. Different concentrations of Dox are applied to cell culture at the same time.
Transfected cells are cultured for 48 hours before performing flow cytometry, long enough for protein expression level to achieve steady state. FACS examination measures florescent intensity emitted by each cell, from which we obtain a large sample of florescent protein expression level, tens of thousands of cells for each experiment group.
Data collected from flow cytometry are later analyzed on computers. We estimated probability density function (p.d.f.) from data using kernel density estimation, a nonparametric statistics method. Given high and low Dox concentration input, cells exhibit different probability distributions, as illustrated in the example below [ref: fig].
What we have in hand is the conditional distribution $p\left( {Y\left| {X = x} \right.} \right)$ , given a known level of input $x$ . In order to calculate mutual information $I\left( {X;Y} \right) = \iint {p\left( {x,y} \right){{\log }_2}\frac{{p\left( {x,y} \right)}}{{p\left( x \right)p\left( y \right)}}dxdy}$  and estimate channel capacity, which is $C = \sup I\left( {X;Y} \right)$ , we need to find the input distribution $p\left( X \right)$ and joint distribution $p\left( {X,Y} \right)$ that optimizes the equation. $p\left( X \right)$ , however, is not known in the first place. We first randomly pick a stochastic vector as the initial input distribution and then use an optimization algorithm to iterate the function and maximize $I\left( {X;Y} \right)$ . The final result is the channel capacity.
Results
Do our circuits work?
Yes, they do sense the input level of Dox concentration. Figure. illustrates the changing distribution of EBFP2 florescent intensity in response to Dox gradient. With higher concentration, the distribution shifts to the right till reaching saturation. (TRE-EBFP2N:IntN and TRE-EBFP2C"
Calgary,2013,Team:Calgary#Sandbox#Notebook#Journal#Reporter_-_-_TEXT.html," the feasibility of our magnetism idea. Dr. Max Anikovskiy, an instructor from the nanoscience program, allowed us to use a 50 lb. pull force rare earth magnet to manipulate native horse spleen ferritin. However, there were no changes over a three hour period. We also spoke to Dr. Simon Trudel from the nanomagnetism research group. He seemed to think our idea was feasible, but might require optimizing with respect to the solvent system in which the particles are dissolved. From both these meetings, it emerged that modelling the fluid dynamics is beyond our capabilities. Our best bet is to test these ideas experimentally, one step at a time, by first synthesizing and testing magnetoferritin.

Week 7: June 10 - June 14
We visited the Cargill Meat Solutions plant and discovered that our system would be most applicable in identifying cattle who are super shedders, which would require our system to be quantitative. One possible approach utilizes a fusion of TAL and a reporter protein, although this system may subtract from quantification due to binding of multiple DNA strands to the nanoparticle.FIGURE?? An alternative approach utilizes a ferritin-TAL to immobilize target DNA, which can then be visualized through a second TAL fused to a reporter enzyme. FIGURE??
One question we currently have is in the construction of the ferritin genes.  Lee et al. (2002), and Huh and Kim (2003) have successfully created heavy-light chain ferritin subunit fusions, allowing better control of the subunit ratios. Therefore we intend to use a similar approach as it would halve the number of subunits involved, and in turn halve the number of bound TALs, reducing our concerns about steric hindrance. E-coils will be bound to the N-terminus due to its presence on the outside of the nanoparticle,  ensuring exposure to the environment (Luzzago and Cesareni 1989).
Upon further investigation, we found that the creation of Prussian Blue ferritin nanoparticles involve the use of potassium ferrocyanide, a compound that has the potential to evolve hydrogen cyanide. These fears were abated upon contacting members in the nanoscience department, stating the conditions and concentrations involve in our experiment were too low to be of concern.

An issue we addressed this week was the assembly of gene constructs to test ferritin in our system. A tentative strategy plan"
Tec-Chihuahua,2018,Team:Tec-Chihuahua#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html,"keeping, “the larvae are interesting, but not so important concerning the application"".
Regarding the application method of our product, we were considering putting nanocapsules containing our AMPs within the bee’s liquid food substitute. He said it’s feasible, but we would want to make sure bees could digest them. An excellent measure he suggested us was to eventually plan to extract the hypopharyngeal glands in bees and determine if our AMPs are entering these glands.
He believes okay for us to supply our peptides and then try to see if they help bees resist foulbrood, as for now, he thinks it's an excellent first step if we can produce some material and prove it to work on the laboratory, he mentioned that's a paper already. He emphasized is not easy to have real larvae on the laboratory.
We were wondering his opinion whether our AMPs could affect the larvae negatively in their development or worker bees in general. He compared or product to a human antibiotic, it kills the disease, but it also eliminates part of its microbiota, he thinks we could mention it, but we would have to test these possibilities experimentally and see what happens. He stated antibiotic treatments available now for foulbrood not always work, and they could contaminate the honey. Regarding the possibility of our AMPs getting into the honey, he thinks there are going to be low levels of our peptides, and they are going to be on the larvae, he doesn't think it's going to be a problem our AMPs getting to the honey.
If we did get to test within larvae, we asked him which would be an optimum method to find out if our peptides are getting to the developing brood.
Consider two scenarios, feeding the larvae in vitro, where we won't be making use of a nurse bee or the second scenario where the nurse bee feeds the larvae.
See if our peptides get into the worker jelly; we can look at the hypopharyngeal glands and take a worker jelly sample from the cells where larvae are swirling.
Finally, compare to a control
If we want to see if our AMPs are getting into the food nurse bees are feeding the larvae in the colony, we would have to use a colony or a mini colony, which is more complicated, he said.
""Many people have been working on ways to protect the bees, they have different systems they are using, but none of these experiments involve all these different steps you are needing because it's very ambitious and requires much time"". He thinks if we can get the peptides off our bacterium and then show that they inhibit P. larvae and M."

Our team focused on leguminous plants, we contacted with professor Shan in order to have a better recognition of them. Professor Shan works in the peanut institute of Shandong, aiming at genetic breeding. He is warm-hearted and passionate, inviting us to visit the peanut institute of Shandong.
On July.28.2014, we arrived at the peanut institute of Shandong. Doctor. Zhao led us to visit different parts in the institute and in every lab there were several researchers introducing their project to us. Besides, we discussed some questions connected with our project and obtained a lot of guidance.
In the peanut institute, some labs contributed to the growth of peanut so they were familiar with the characteristics of peanut. In addition, there were many high-technic equipment and experimental methods. Luckily, these staff were kind to show them to us and explained in details. With their help, we knew more about peanut’s structure and living habitats in a micro and macro sight. At first, the mechanism of roots confused us, for example how roots deliver nutrition and the rate, so it was a little bit hard for us to set up a model to illustrate this question. One of the professors did research on the model building of roots. He gave us plenty of tips so we had much more enlightenment.
At last, we had a conversation with professor Shan. He talked with us a lot about how to deal with a scientific problem and emphasized the importance of building up a scientific way of thinking. He also encouraged us to overcome various problems which might occur during our project. Though it just was a short visiting, we learned a lot and it helped us improve our experiment.

Overview
At the Ben-Gurion University, iGEM was recently established as a General University course under the auspices of the Faculty of Natural Sciences, Department of Life Sciences. The course is offered to students from all faculties in their last year of studies of their undergraduate degree. Only students that excel in their studies and have passed a personal interview with the course advisers are accepted and admitted to the course.
The course takes place over a full academic year, beginning in the academic year preceding the competition (Fall Semester) and ending after the iGEM Jamboree in the following Fall. The first assignment for the course was given during the summer vacation, when each student prepared an original idea for an iGEM project and presented it to the rest of the team. After all the ideas were presented, a team vote decided what will be the team’s choice project for that year. The next part of the course, which lasts approximately three months, involved intensive literature review and research to prepare a detailed research proposal. Each student thoroughly studied a specific element of the project and taught the information to the rest of the team. The last part of the course, involved lab work. The team established the lab themselves, ordered the necessary equipment and materials necessary for their project. From then on, the team has been working in the lab, applying their idea through experiments towards a proof of concept and demonstration of the viability of the proposed approach.
The goal of the iGEM course is to teach the students how to pursue independent scientific research. The students learn how to choose a research topic, whether it be a purely scientific question or one with practical applications. Then they learn how to choose experimental methods and plan experiments with the available equipment and knowledge, if necessary the team has consulted with experts in the field. Additionally, the students learn how to manage ongoing research through team meetings. The students experience real time problem solving, risk evaluation, writing research proposals, and experimental analysis.
In addition to the scientific aspect of the course, there is also the Human Practice aspect. Throughout the course the students work on presenting the project to the public through many different social and media platforms,"

Today, because of our previous results, we decided to do a binding test with our T4 DNA Ligase. We linked the K346004 cut with EcoRI and Xbal, to itself, to analyze the possible alternatives of linking it to pSB1C3.
Electrophoretic profile of the binding test of K346004 to itself.
1. K346004 cut/linear with EcoRI and XbaI not linked.
2. K346004 cut/linear with EcoRI and XbaI linked.
As we can see on the electrophoretic profile, T4 DNA ligase is active! Knowing that, we concluded that our binding system made on August 12th worked, but the DNA concentration was too low to grow transformed bacteria that would show in their plasmids the desired linked fragments.
Due to this result, today we concentrated the binding system of BB_Essential + BB_Bioremediation, BB_Essential + K346004 and BB_Essential + E0840 and we transformed DH5α by electroporation.

Phillip's notes:
Introduction:  Today, DLS will be done on the purified PCquadY from last week.  The elutions will be pooled before bringing it to Kevin.
Procedure: The first two elutions from the experiment visibly contained a white precipitate, which is likely the protein cage.  These tubes were pooled and centrifuged.  The pellet was re-suspended in 150uL of triton lysis buffer.
Results:  The supernatant sample and the re-suspended pellet were both ran.  Both did not provide a baseline reading.
Conclusion:  Since aggregation seems to be a problem, the DLS may have to be ran soon after purification."

Nevertheless, it is important to consider that if subtitles in your own language may be available, most of classes are registered in English, which may be a limitation for some people.
Let’s make a quick review of the major MOOC platforms and their offer in biology and especially synthetic biology classes!
Coursera.org
With a large offer of free classes, Coursera is a great place to start learning about biology and synbio.
When looking for synthetic biology classes, Coursera proposes 3 specializations which are specific cursus in which you follow different courses on a topic leading to a validate certificate.       However, if you do not want to pay you can still access the class for free.        The specializations are the following:
Systems biology, from Mount Sinai School of Medicine, which include 5 courses to cover the overall specialization, from mathematical modeling to experimental system biology.
Bioinformatics is taught by the University of California, San Diego, through 6 courses covering hidden message in DNA, evolution and big data in biology.
Genomic data sciences from Johns Hopkins University which is providing a solid background on data sciences applied to biology through 7 courses from Python, Statistics to Algorithms.          In addition, you can also find basic biology or bioinformatics lessons as well as other classes such as  Engineering Life: Synbio, Bioethics & Public Policy; Experimental genomic sciences, Epigenomics; Neurosciences or Plant Biology!
EdX.org
With some of the best universities in the world, this platform is providing many courses on biology from beginners to advanced levels.       Some noteworthy classes proposed here have been provided by the MIT and Harvard, from “Introduction to biology” to “Principles of Synthetic Biology”.       Other broader topics are available such as “Lab Safety: The Interactive Game of Don’t Endanger the Owls” (Rice University) or “Science at the Polls: Biology for Voters”, whose aim is to provide every citizens with the basic knowledge required to be an aware voters (University of Berkeley).
Making an exhaustive list of all the biology courses available online would be an endless task as each month new courses are available while some are removed.       Do not hesitate to look for platform specific to your country or field of research: for instance, OpenClassroom and Udacity for computer sciences, Canvas, France-universite-numerique, NovoEd, OpenMooc and plenty of others can be found!
For those who are not willing to follow a full class on a topic but still want to improve"

In order to verify the competency of KT1144 cells, I have transformed pBluescript into them. Competent KT1144 cells are needed to test the mutant circuits.

Bacterial Transformation & Response circuit
I shadowed Jeremy today. He was transforming the BBK ligated vector to competent cells (Top 10). I'm not sure exactly what he was transforming but I just hung out to learn the procedures and purposes of transformation.
Jamie and I were working on possible applications of the response circuit. We proposed that we should have bacteria produce wintergreen smell in response to stinky odor. The Wintergreen gene already exists in the registry so we could use a sulfur sensitive promoter in bacteria which would bind to sigma 54 and together bind to Pqrr4 promoter. Since Pqrr4 initiates the response circuit, further down the line, we could add the Winter green gene which would then be activated as sigma 54 latches on the Pqrr4.
I followed up with a few companies. BioAlberta has generously donated $1000.00 to the team. I wrote a Thank-You letter on behalf of the team and sent it to the President of BioAlberta.
VICKI
A sexy circuit discussion
Fahd and I worked together to propose a possible response circuit. We investigated the possiblity of using parts from the registry that can form a bioplastic, which could be useful for encapsulating cells that need to be inserted into the human body to - say - degrade a biofilm, but need to resist an immune and inflammatory response. Some considerations for our next discussion on this front will be whether or not this part works, and if so, what form the bioplastic comes in.

After being shaken, 0.125mL of culture was added to a volume of 25 mL of SGx2 media, and 2.5 mL of 10% xylose was added to the tube not containing xylose already. This meant that both tubes had a concentration of 1% xylose in the end.  These were then shaken for 3 days and placed in the fridge, after which the spores were washed and resuspended in distilled water (refer to B. subtilis protocols) .
Spore treatment results:
There was growth seen for each condition, with exception to the spores being lit on fire in the Bunsen burner which was expected.  Overall, the long term storage spores, frozen, seemed to better survive the chemical conditions, and the short term,  fridge, spores seemed to better survive the extreme temperature conditions.  For long term storage, there was 3 large colonies seen on 1% Bleach plate, 5 large colonies on 70% ethanol, and 11 large colonies on drying.  Whereas, for short term storage, there was 2 large and 1 small colonies on 70% ethanol, 1 medium colony on 60 ° C, and 1 medium colony on 90 ° C plate.  It was later decided that the long term storage spores should be plated by themselves, without them being subject to any other conditions.  This resulted in a full lawn of large colonies after being incubated at 37 ° C for 72 hours.  From this it appears that long term storage is a better method for preserving the B. subtilis spores than short term storage for the purposes of our diagnostic device.

Communicating with other teams
We held academic exchange activities with the other two iGEM teams, NJU-CHINA and NAU-CHINA.
1. Asking the NJU_CHINA team for experience exchange
At the Life Science Building Conference room in Nanjing University, the two leaders talked about the progress on their own subjects and the status quo of the team. Yu Zhou, the leader of Nanjing University team, told us about their recent sessions of the iGEM, and explained some important time node, like human practice attention points, the contents of the two co-operation and other issues. Also, he showed our team members around their labs. After talking with them, we have gained some knowledge of iGEM competition, which gave us a lot of help in participating in iGEM competition. (figure6).
Figure 6. Our team is listening to the introduction of NJU iGEMer
2. Inviting NJU-CHINA to attend academic debate
In order to enhance the exchange between two teams, we invited the iGEM team of Nanjing University to attend the academic debate (Figure7). Two teams conducted a debate on whether changes in epigenetic modification can determine tumorigenesis at the China Pharmaceutical University Conference Center:
Proposition: CPU_CHINA
Attitude: changes in epigenetic modifications can determine tumorigenesis
Counter: NJU-CHINA
Attitude: changes in epigenetic modifications cannot determine tumorigenesis
The two sides held different arguments, and cited frontier knowledge of self-argument and deduction to express their views. Also, two teams obtained a lot of gains during the debate, and made a further exchange on the issue of respective topics.

A1: Our track is Software, as a result, we would not submit any parts to the iGEM. Hence, we don't have chassis organism.
Q2: How will your project work?
A2: The Synthetic Biologists could use our software to transform truth table into Logic Gates with definitive biological substance, besides, they could use our Simulation feature to verify whether the result is satisfactory. If the result is good, they could use the DNA sequence to wet lab experiments.
Q3: What risks does your project pose at the laboratory stage? What actions are you taking to reduce those risks?
A3: We do not work in any wet lab capacity. We complete our project via computers.
Q4: How would your project be used in the real world?
A4: They could use our software to assist them to design gene circuits and validate them by wet lab experiments.
Q5: What risks might your project pose, if it were fully developed into a real product that real people could use? What future work might you do to reduce those risks?
A5: This project has been constructed exclusively in silico. Therefore, we anticipate no risks or safety issues from any wet lab experiment. Since we focused only on developing software and did not interacting at all with any biological components, we cannot foresee any new safety risks in combining pathogens in any new and novel way. Working and constructing new and novel biological circuits are at the risk of the experimenter. We won't take responsibility for any kind of hazards or risks arising from the results returned from our work. The safety of our fellow scientists is one of our utmost priorities, hence, any lab that wishes to use SBiDer for their own research purposes must, at all times, keep the biosafety regulations of their own institution and country in mind.

IPTG is a molecular mimic for allolactose which binds to LacI and inhibiths it. LacI cannot bind to Plac and repress expression any more, therefore IPTG allows the expression of the gene under the control of this promoter (RFP or T4 lysis cassette in our case).

BGU_Israel,2018,Team:BGU Israel#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," did not receive any treatment) appears very similar to bands 12 and 13 (astrocytes activated by cytokines).
Bands 12 and 13 (astrocytes activated by cytokines) do appear as expected, as the bands are very thick and bold when compared to the negative control in band 2 (sample 1).
The difference in the band strength in lanes 2 and 11 (11 is stronger) indicates that it is preferable to grow astrocytes exclusively in their native medium, rather than in medium intended for microglia.
The different activation methods do not significantly increase the reactivity of the astrocytes. Possibly, adding the three cytokines increases the secretion of C3 protein in the astrocytes and therefore a stronger band appears in this sample (bands 12 and 13). However, the difference in band width is not significant enough to make concrete conclusions.
We repeated this experiment several times (5) with similar analysis (western blot) with similar results, therefore we conclude that these results are reliable and not results of technical or human error.
From these results we must conclude that cell line C8D30 is in a state of reactiveness, without additional induction of activation. Although this does not match the expectations which we based on Liddelow, 2017 these results are not so surprising, as the article is based on work with primary cells while we are working with cell lines.
In conclusion, we can proceed with experiments on our C8D30 astrocyte cell line as a reactive astrocyte model without performing activation treatments. The problem with these results is that we do not have a resting astrocyte model to work with.
 Experiment Weaknesses:
We used astrocyte cell line rather than primary cells which were used in article from which we took our protocol.
LPS was added to microglia cell line to induce cytokine secretion, rather than LPS injection to mouse models as in the article.
Western blot analysis is less precise and sensitive than ELISA. Additionally, the results are qualitative rather than quantitative.
Experiment Strengths:
The experiment we discussed is representative of four other similar experiments. Therefore, we base our conclusions on many repetitions which indicate that the C8D30 cell line is in a reactive state.
Future Plans:
GFAP is also considered a marker of A1 reactive astrocytes3. Therefore, we recommend using both C3 and GFAP as markers to strengthen the reliability of experimental results.
We recommend using ELISA rather than western blot analysis to measure reactivity.
It is recommended to perform immunohistochemistry with markers for re"

At this point iGEM IIT helped and bought the kits for Berlin diagnostX from a local reseller.
Jointly established RNA isolation pipeline at IIT:
After visiting physicians and villages in the area of Varanasi and meeting people affected by T. solium, Dimi and Henrik went to IIT Delhi to establish RNA isolation in the lab of iGEM IIT Delhi. Having the option to perform RNA isolation was crucial for diagnostX because the laboratories in Varanasi did not have the proper equipment for RNA isolation. The chances were high that isolation of RNA was necessary for export. The team from Delhi organised a student dorm for Henrik and Dimi to stay in and thus allowing them to work day and night on improving an RNA isolation protocol that ultimately yielded high quality RNA.
Championing international trade and safety regulations:
Once Dr. Mishra of the Heritage Institute for Medical Sciences received a tapeworm sample containing eggs from Taenia Solium and processed them, the Berlin Team had to transport the RNA-sample from India to Germany for sequencing. Due to a change in the Indian trade policy in June 2015, no company, hospital or physician could send samples abroad without obtaining an “Import Export Code”. Obtaining this code is bureaucratic and complicates taxation. For this reason, despite having the sample and a carrier with expertise in the field (World Courier, an AmerisourceBergen company), diagnostX was unable to transfer the sample to Germany. At this point iGEM IIT Delhi supported the Berlin team again by shipping the sample to IIT and subsequently exporting it with permission of the IIT. This shipping procedure took over two months and the joint effort of the Berlin and Delhi iGEM teams to complete but it was a key step to the transcriptome data and the sensor described by iGEM Berlin diagnostX.
The team TU Darmstadt contacted the team Berlin diagnostX in search of background information on wound care and healing for their project. Since the body of the team Berlin is made up of medical students it was delighted to help.
During an initial Skype meeting both teams talked about their ideas and plans for the iGEM competition and gave each other helpful feedback. When the conversation fell on wound care and  healing the Team Berlin reinforced its willingness to share knowledge gained in medical school and to consult experts to answer the special questions"

Paris_Bettencourt,2015,Team:Paris Bettencourt#Sustainability#Continuity_-_-_TEXT.html," only one strain that does everything is a huge advantage, because only one bioreactor and one production line is needed. This makes it accessible to community labs or NGOs that would want to start producing their own version of our product.
Our design
From the lab to the world
For a biological product to leave the benches and actually reach the population, it's essential to foresee its life in the hands of the people who will cultivate it and make sure it stays alive all along. Our design must therefore provide strategies to create an durable, usable product. On paper, the plan is simple: the manufacturers grow the micro-organism, distribute it and save a little fraction to start a new culture with. This could in principle last forever, but in reality the universal rules of biology soon kick back in.
Let's consider the following scenario: a wild type organism sneaks into the incubator and starts to replicate along with the engineered organism. Our microbe cannot compete: this contaminant has been selected precisely for its ability to sneak into environments and replicate, during hundreds of years, while our microbe has the burden of producing tons of enzymes to make the precious vitamins. Additionally, unnatural proteins and metabolites can have toxic effects when their production rate is high. After a couple of growth cycle, the worst seems unavoidable: the micro-organism that will be distributed will not be the right one. Not only this one doesn't produce nutrients, but it might not ferment the rice well or even be pathogenic.
These contamination events bring a lot of hassle for the manufacturer, so our design must provide solutions for making them as rare as possible.
Our approaches is based on two strategies:
Reducing the fitness burden: To make our micro-organism more resistant to contamination, we need to design it so our modifications come with a minimal fitness cost.
Identifying the contamination: If a contamination occurs, it is essential that it does not go unnoticed. Our design must allow the manufacturer to detect contamination, and check that what he is growing is exactly what he wants to grow.
It seems impossible to make a strain that fullfills its nutrient-producing functions while growing as fast as the wild type, so we found a workaround: the cells that people use are not the cells that people grow.
We embedded a differentiation system into our organism, so the vitamin-producing pathways are only expressed after a recombination event. First, the cells that are grown are almost identical to the wild-type cells. Before distribution, the differentiation is induced and the cells start to produce vitamins in high quantity. The battle against contaminants is now a fair fight.

We found a colorimeter device from IO Rodeo, a company that develops open source hardware and software for educational purposes. They sold a spectrophotometer which we hypothesized would work for our assay for $80. One reason for the price difference is the EPOCH is a monochronometer covers a spectrum from 200 nm - 999 nm, selectable in 1 nm increments.  The IO Rodeo is based on an 365nm LED and requires hardware changes to adjust the wavelength of emission and detection.  Our enzyme assay is based on oxidation of the enzyme cofactor NADH into NAD.  The standard wavelength for detection of this reaction is 340nm, however the NADH has a broad spectrum (see figure below).  Based on the differences in NAD and NADH spectral signals we hypothesized that the 365nm LED should provide a sufficient signal to detect the NADH to NAD conversion.
We purchased the IO Rodeo spectrophotometer and compared NADH sensitivity on the IO Rodeo spectrophotometer and EPOCH spectrophotometer.
Test #1: NADH Sensitivities We first compared the linear ranges of the devices and found that there was a linear relationship between NADH concentration and absorbance between 6 micro molar and 400 micro molar for both devices. This means that both instruments had the required sensitivity for our assay under ideal conditions:
Protocol for colorimeter test #1:
All test solutions were prepared from a single freshly made 0.5 mM NADH stock solution. Each test solution was measured in triplicate on both the IO Rodeo colorimeter and the EPOCH spectrophotometer.
Test #2:  FabI Inhibition Assays (i.e. functional prototype) In order to illustrate the utility of a device that meets our design requirements. We then tested to see if the IO Rodeo device could be used for an inhibition assay.  As illustrated in Figure below the NADH oxidation rate is significantly lower in the presence of nM triclosan levels than in the absence of triclosan.  The IO rodeo portable spectrophotometer is also able to detect various levels of triclosan inhibition...right out of the box!
This assay used triplicates of 2 nM P. falciparum FabI. 100 uM crotonyl-CoA, 100 uM NADH
We are now working in refining the assay to measure and improve robustness ("

 Impact
Foundational achievements of this project open several avenues for synthetic biology but also for other fields of science and for diverse applications.
Several new valuable tools and collections of parts have been developed in the project, from a toolset of orthogonal proteases to an in vivo mechanosensing system, which could be further implemented with other settings and parts.
nbsp;Mechanosensing - following the footsteps of Optogenetics
The project was very successful in the implementation of designed mechanosensitive genetic circuits.        We have demonstrated cell activation by ultrasound, direct touch, and flow of liquid, which demonstrates that other direct or indirect        mechanical forces, such as the osmotic stress, pressure and others could be detected in this system. Mechano-sensing plays a very important        role in many biological senses, such as hearing, proprioception but also in senses that are developed only in some animals, such as the lateral        line of fish. It is likely that the systems based on our building modules might be able to detect gravity, acceleration and pressure. Delivery of the        mechano-sensing platform could be accomplished through viruses, which would probably be more appropriate for in vivo applications, where the focused        ultrasound will spatially limit the activation of targeted cells.
 Protease-based signaling
Although the specificity of viral proteases have been described before, this is the first time that functional split protease variants are produced and characterized.        We envision that this toolset and moreover innovative synthetic protease-based signaling pathways will find their use for engineered cells. This system is based on modules        which already enabled us the design of several two-input logic functions in vivo, which suggest that more complex circuits could readily be constructed. Additionally,        it is likely that the number of orthogonal proteases could be further expanded. Point mutations of known proteases, such as the TEVpE and TEVpH demonstrate that the recognition        sites could further be engineered.
We demonstrated by simulation that the activation of selected logic functions can be relatively fast, while the system needs to be reset to       the resting state considerably slowly, comparable to the transcriptional type of regulation, that is within hours. None of the active proteases was toxic to human cells, so        their implementation for signaling pathways does not seem to pose any problems to further developments. Release of proteins or peptides from cells has been demonstrated and       the capacity of the secretory machinery for secretion will have to be investigated in details in comparison to the secretion via exocyt"

Following a similar protocol to the one performed on 5/18.
Growing up cells in 100ml of LB.
We are doing a smaller volume because we are running low on bugbuster lysis reagents, and we want to be able to do at least one more reaction after this one.
Instead of making a starter culture, we are simply inoculating a colony into a 2L beveled culture flask.
I would have used a 1L one, but there were none available.
I started incubating the culture at 12:35 pm 7/27, but I forgot to add the Kanamycin antibiotic until 1 pm.  (100 ul of 1000x).
Here are the steps for today's growth protocol.
Inoculate one colony in 100 ml of LB in an autoclaved beveled flask.
Add appropriate antibiotics.
Grow and shake at 37 until OD reaches between 0.4 and 0.6.
At that point, add IPTG to final concentration of 0.5 mM
Continue to incubate at 37 C and shake overnight.
In the morning, spin down the cells, decant the supernatant, and freeze the pellet at -80 for storage.
THE LB WE USED TO GROW OUR CELLS WAS CONTAMINATED! :( WILL REPEAT TOMORROW"

The rubber world as we know it
""Demand is indeed increasing, and the IRSG projections estimate the global consumption of natural rubber to reach 13.0 million tons."" - iGEM SDU 2013
Figure 1 - The Global Rubber Consumption
Today almost all of the natural rubber produced in the world comes from the rubber tree  known as Hevea brasiliensis. The tree is native to the Amazonas, but has been introduced to environments in the tropics, especially in plantations located in the south-eastern regions of Asia. The overall area is unknown, but given that clones of Hevea brasiliensis have been shown to produce between 2-3 t/ha/yr - a production maximum, and then assuming that all plantations produce 2 t/ha/yr and that the total global production is 11.3 mio t/yr, the area of plantations is very roughly 57.000 km2, or approximately the size of Croatia. This is of course only an estimate, the total area could be much larger.

Initiator Binding Test
Test initiator binding only.
Bind, then elute, then analyze on e-gel.
Test four conditions:
Init only
Init + beads, then elute
Init + A + B
Init + term.
1 uL of 5 uM initiator used, 1 uL of 5 uM terminator.
50 ng of each other fragments.
The same protocol as 6/19/2015 was used, with the following modifications.
initial binding time was increased to 45 minutes.
Washes were performed using 100 uL of solution.
Results
After elution, we visualized the constructs on 1% e-gel.
Nothing showed up on the gel, although we expect the initiator in condition 1 to appear.
Possibly due to mistakes made during sample preparation.
BsaI Digestion
Set up 2x 50 uL reactions for each MaSp monomer.
Digested ~5 ug of each MaSp plasmid using 4 uL of BsaI.
Incubated 2 hours at 50 C, then heat for 20 minutes at 65 C.
Visualized results on 1.5% gel, using 2 uL of 50 bp ladder.

1.Overview
Recent researches show that 4S pathway（a four-step enzymatic pathway that converts DBT to 2-hydroxybiphenyl (HBP) and sulfate） has a great significance in biological desulfurization. Mechanisms related to the 4S pathway have been broadly studied. In our project, we tried to study the pathway with mathematical theories and modeling. Based on the model of E.coli lac operon system in which lactose is used as an inducer, we derived the optimal proportions of Dsz-enzymes and the most accurate induced concentration of IPTG. Also, we calculated the best proportion between water and oil in the reactors, which effectively optimizes the system.
We analyzed the major parts of this pathway respectively, such as using Michaelis-Menten equation and substrate inhibition equation to analyze catalytic process of enzymes, as well as using differential equations(ODE) to analyze the concentration variations of different components in the system during the catalysis. We also established relevant models to fit images, building up a three-dimensional sense of understanding.
2. Enzymes’ proportional model in 4S Pathway
The procedure of 4S Pathway:
2.1 Theory Part
As the picture above illustrates, there are totally 4 enzymes participating in the 4S pathway. Through the pathway the C-S bonds in the DBTs are cleaved. After 4 steps of oxidation, the sulfur elements are converted into sulfate or sulfite, thereby dissolving in water and being removed. Meanwhile DBT is oxidized to HBP and remains in the oil phase, without degrading the hydrocarbons, which means the calorific value won’t be reduced. This is the process of 4s pathway biodesulfurization.
However, the lacking in durability of catalytic activity in the 4S pathway has become a major obstacle to BDS. Studies have found that HBP and HBPS in 4S pathway"
Marburg,2018,Team:Marburg#Design_-_-_TEXT.html,"amyicin in this example). Because cloning is never 100 % efficient, re-ligation of LVL0 plasmids is a common event, and in case of the LVL0 resistance part, results in false positive colonies which do not contain the desired LVL1 plasmid.
We developed a solution for this problem by creating the novel resistance entry vectors BBa_K2560005 and BBa_K2560006. These plasmids contain a
RFP
and
sfGFP
dropout, respectively, and a chloramphenicol resistance cassette that is flanked by BsaI and BsmBI recognition sites. When a new LVL0 resistance part is cloned, the chloramphenicol resistance is replaced by the new antibiotic resistance marker resulting in a
RFP
or
sfGFP
expressing plasmid with the respective resistance marker. When using these LVL0 parts for LVL1 cloning, the re-ligated resistance parts yield colonies with a visually detectable phenotype. As a result, correct plasmids can be easily identified, even for inefficient LVL1 clonings with < 10 % efficiency.
Choice of fusion sites
Golden-gate based cloning relies upon the use of type IIs restriction endonucleases like BsaI, BsmBI or BpiI. In comparison to the commonly used type II restriction enzymes (e.g. EcoRI or PstI) they also recognize a specific DNA sequence but cleave outside of their recognition sequence (Pingoud and Jeltsch, 2001) . The golden-gate-cloning method is taking advantage of this property. A single enzyme can be used to create various single-stranded overhangs that match in a predefined order and finally lead to the correctly assembled plasmid (Pingoud and Jeltsch, 2001) .
When we started to design the Marburg Collection, we carefully investigated which fusion sites should be used. The fusion sites do not only set the order in which the single parts will be assembled but also affect the assembly efficiency and determine if a newly designed toolbox is compatible with already existing collections, so that parts can be shared easily. For us, the most important and decisive argument was that we wanted to be compatible with as many other toolboxes as possible. It is our strong belief that scientists all over the world should agree on one set of fusion sites to ensure complete interchangeability between different toolboxes. The toolboxes of MoClo (Weber et al. 2011) , Loop Assembly (Pollak et al. 2018) and the"

This change actually changes the crRNA and  taRNA sequence and therefore could result to the deviated results. Another possibility is simply because the genetic context that we did our characterization was different from what  Isaac et al. used to characterize their riboregulator system. If this is the case, we can at least see that the system is not very modular: changing the genetic context can change  the fold increase.
The fluorescence after induction is still low compared to that of unrepressed controls.
Although we saw significant fold increase for two riboregulator systems that we have characterize, compared to the fluorescence of unrepressed controls, the fluorescence is very low.  For Lock 1-Key 1 riboeregulator system, the fluorescence after induction only correspond to around 0.4% of the that of the unrepressed control. For the Lock 3-Key3 system,   the value was around 0.3%. The lower expression partly is because of the lower mRNA levels. After the introduction of the cis-repressing sequence the mRNA level was 40% of   that of the controls (Isaacs et al., 2004). Another reason for low fluorescence after induction could have resulted because of our genetic context. We have used a relatively   strong constitutive promoter ( BBa_J23102 ) to express the crRNA and a relatively weak arabinose inducible promoter   ( BBa_I0500 ). This could have caused imbalance of crRNA and taRNA levels. We could have had lower taRNA level and therefore failed  to fully activate the riboregulator system. Further investigation is required. Simply changing the arabinose inducible promoter to a strong promoter can tell us whether this is the   case.
Different Lock-Key cognate pairs behaved differently to different arabinose concentration.
Lock 1- Key 1 riboregulator cognate pair was fully induced and leveled off at 1% arabinose concentration. For Lock 3- Key 3 pair, the full induction was observed at 2.5% arabinose  concentration. We did not conduct further investigation to understand the difference in the response. Further investigation on how changing the riboregulator sequence can change  the sensitivity of the system could be an interesting study.

The discussion was heated and let each group gain precious suggestions. In terms of our own project, we were impressed of the valuable advice from TMMU-China. They suggested that we can change or chassis bacteria in the dialysis part from Bacterium typhimurium to Bacillus subtilis, and this kind of adjust can make the dialysis system safer and better. After careful consideration and weighing both advantages and disadvantages of those two chassis strains, we finally adopted their suggestion and chose Bacillus subtilis to be the chassis bacteria in the dialysis system.

Newcastle,2017,Team:Newcastle#Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html," own Biosensor’ is an interactive activity we developed to get the students thinking about synthetic biology independently. Many of the students did not know what a biosensor was, so this was also a good way to introduce the function and purpose of biosensors in an understandable and relatable way. We asked the students to think about what they would like to sense (an input), and how this would be detected (an output). There were lots of fun and creative responses!
We also had many great conversations with both school pupils and teachers, based around 4 main questions that we posed:
What is synthetic biology?
What do you think synthetic biology can achieve?
How does the current curriculum tackle synthetic biology, and how would you change science teaching if you could?
How do you engage with science outside of the classroom?
It was great to spread awareness of synthetic biology among the next generation of scientists, and even give teachers ideas for how they could introduce synthetic biology teaching into their lessons!
Corpus Linguistics
Corpus linguistics is a method which can be used to access and analyse large bodies of text, and uncover patterns within them. In our research, we used corpus linguistics to complete searches for the terms genetic engineering, synthetic biology, GMO and biosensor . We searched two main corpora which contain texts published in the media from 1995- present day, and completed analysis which allowed us to see how the media uses language to discuss these topics, and which attitudes are presented. The corpus linguistics research made us more aware of the lack of coverage of synthetic biology within media texts. It also showed how discussion around synthetic biology is populated with both positive and negative viewpoints, whilst giving indications of how we can use language to accentuate the positive, and increase clarity and transparency in communication. The report linked here is a detailed discussion of the corpus linguistics research and findings: A Corpus Based Investigation Into Science Communication.
Synthetic Biology Communication Guidelines
As a culmination of our research into science communication, we have complied a set of guidelines for communicating synthetic biology to the public. These guidelines can be used for different purposes, including: to advise scientists when communicating about their work to the press; to guide in how to present to the public; and to help iGEM teams writing up their work! The guidelines start with some more general points to consider when you start to communicate synthetic biology. They also make use of the information we gained during the corpus linguistics research to suggest some more specific linguistic features to consider when communicating synthetic biology. Read the guidlines here: Breaking down the barriers: How should we communicate SynBio to the public?

Bielefeld-CeBiTec,2017,Team:Bielefeld-CeBiTec#Project#unnatural base pair#uptake and biosynthesis_-_-_TEXT.html," Cell with iso-CmTP and iso-GTP
The first essential step to ensure that unnatural base pairs are retained over a long period of time is to provide the cell with the unnatural bases required for the replication of the DNA containing the unnatural base pair. There are two different strategies for it.  The first one is to supplement the media with the (deoxy-)nucleoside triphosphates of the desired unnatural bases. To allow uptake of the nucleoside triphosphates, the cell needs to possess a transporter that can facilitate a sufficient flux into the cell. While this strategy seems to be the easiest, it also has some disadvantages. First, E. coli does not possess nucleoside triphosphate transporters suitable for the transport of unnatural nucleoside triphosphates. Given that nucleoside triphosphates such as ATP are absent in the extracellular environment, such transporters have not evolved in E. coli. Another reason for the absence of nucleoside triphosphate transporters from the cell membrane is that the existence of such transporters could potentially put the intracellular ATP pool at risk. Therefore, a heterologous transporter has to be introduced. Secondly, chemically synthesized nucleotides are very expensive, so feeding them to the cells would make bioprocesses uneconomically for scale up. On the other hand, this strategy allows the testing of highly unique unnatural bases if uptake can be ensured.
The second strategy is based on the in vivo biosynthesis of the desired unnatural bases. This strategy would allow scaling up of processes without making them uneconomical and would eliminate the need for a heterologous transport system. But the biosynthesis of fully synthetic bases is, if possible at all, extremely challenging. Furthermore, to allow the incorporation of those bases into the DNA, phosphorylation of the nucleosides has to be ensured which is facilitated by in part highly specific kinases. Therefore, this strategy represents an optimal system which as of now is extremely challenging to implement.
Figure 1: Two strategies for making iso-CmTP and iso-GTP available to the cell.
The first strategy (left) is based on a heterologous transporter which can facilitate the transport of iso-CmTP and iso-GTP. The media is supplemented with the unnatural (deoxy)nucleoside triphosphates, which are then transported into the cell and incorporated into the DNA. The second strategy (right) is more complex and is based on the de novo synthesis of the unnatural (deoxy)nucleoside triphosphates. Therefore, existing pathways from natural"

SDS-PAGE
We test the expression of glutamate gamma-aminobutyrate antiporter and glutamate decarboxylase (GAD), which were coded by gadC and gadA respectively. Fig. 2 shows the result of SDS-PAGE. The protein size of the antiporter should be 55.22 kDa, and for the GAD enzyme should be 52.91 kDa. Protein bands in the correct molecular weight range were visualized in the area around 50 kDa. Comparing the control group, which used endogenous, wild-type E. coli Nissle, the protein bands presented in the supernatant of E. coli Nissle liquid culture with constructed plasmid were clearer, indicating that gadC and gadA are expressed.

Amino Acid Analyzer
We also tried to measure the yield of γ－aminobutyric acid (GABA) by using amino acid analyzer (AAA). Firstly, analytically pure GABA sample solution was tested and the result is shown in Fig. 3. The peak of GABA should have rention time of 48 min to 49 min, according to the standard control run.

Indeed, each advanced biological research contains a lot of questions on the health implications, environmental, social and ethical implications of possible applications of these discoveries. Are we able to control the living? Are we able to control the spread of systems that we built? While they are a majority think that researchers are capable of manipulating life, we remain skeptical with control its spread.
Can we control the living?
Do you think we should be able to control the spread of systems that we built?
Faced with theses questions, how the company will position itself and how it will respect the ethics rules. Because of the life control, the public is faced with a control by research area while having the feeling of being dispossessed of research results. How the company is going to express their wishes on these issues?
In the context of synthetic biology, is global governance feasible?
Given the stakes, the debate should be pluralist and collective, we have to know  who will control and how? Do we need  new regulations, while those for existing GMOs are already far from perfection and  unaccepted? Can we aspire to global governance? 46% of persons believe that such governance is possible, while 31% think otherwise. However, how can we adapt these regulations?
Conclusion of the survey
The survey draws the attention of politicians, researchers and lawyers, reminding them that the innovation and therapeutic goal arguments are often wrongly used by supporters of a world where everything is protected and patented. A public debate is necessary to decide together how to maximize the positive applications of these technologies while minimizing the abusive risks.

TU_Delft,2015,Team:TU Delft#Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," nanowires. The cyanobacteria will be trapped by these nanowires in such a way that specific structures of both E.coli and cyanobacteria are formed. These specific structures can increase the production rate as the  ratio of cyanobacteria to E.coli can be engineered to ideally match the steady state conversion rates, while at the same time reducing diffusion limitations between both partners.
Using TU Delft’s 3D printer could improve both the reproducibility and specificity of the biofilm. The 3D printer would, for example, be able to print a layer of cyanobacteria in between two layers of E.coli to create specific patterns that optimize carbon sharing and product formation in Amsterdam’s consortium.
Specific Application: The Bio-composite Leaf
Besides potentially optimizing the productivity of  Amsterdam’s consortium in a bioreactor, accurately printing biofilms allows for a whole range of novel consortia applications. One of these is the so-called ‘bio-composite leaf’, an approach described by Bernal et al. as ‘[an] approach to improve solar energy harvesting capacity [by] fabricating inexpensive water- based ‘‘cellular biocomposite’’ materials that mimic or exceed the function and stability of natural plant leaves by ordering layers of closely packed living photosynthetic cells on a surface with a non-toxic adhesive polymer binder’ (2014). Such multilayered composites of densely packed cells could significantly improve the low light harvesting capacity of cyanobacteria commonly observed in photobioreactors.
Packing cyanobacterial cells together without losing photosynthetic capacity poses a scientific challenge. The most successful method used to date exploits adhesive colloidal polymer particles that bind the cyanobacteria to a leaf that consists of porous paper, which hydrates the cell coating via the fluid in the paper pores below the coating [figure 1]. Although this approach generates high photosynthetic rates, creating the latex coating is a time-consuming, complex process that has not been optimised for uniformity of the coating. A standardised, relatively simple process for creating such coatings could not only overcome these problems, but could ultimately enable the mass-production of bio-composite leaves for high-yield sustainable bioproduction.
Figure 1. Extrusive coating method described by Bernal et al. (2014).
That’s where TU Delft’s 3D-printer for biofilms comes in. By using their biobricks that enable rapid immobilization of organisms via nanowires, together with the ability to accurately print these in the form of biofilms, one could create cell coatings that would be easy"

Wetlab
The wet lab started at the beginning of summer and lasted for three months. Our wet lab work is divided into four parts, namely: (1) cell viability and fatty acid quantification, (2) fatty acid sensing mechanism, (3) mitochondrial leader sequence, and (4) construction of glyoxylate shunt. During the summer, lab work such as primer design, digestion, and ligation was carried out extensively and useful data were collected. These can be retrieved from Notebook and Protocols pages for details of experimental flows. The BioBrick, researcher, environmental and university safety issues can be found in Safety page. In terms of project process, some experiments could not be completed due to time constrains and they are outlined in Future Work page.

TU_Delft,2016,Team:TU Delft#Practices_-_-_TEXT.html,". We distingue 3 different types of competitors, respectively the use of regular fossil fuels, solar panels with regular encapsulation layers and chemically produced microlens arrays. Alternative sustainable sources, for example wind energy and biofuels, are disregarded, because we believe that the degree of threat of these resources is limited for us.
Regular fossil fuels
Coal, oil and gas are examples of fossil fuels. These are currently the most used energy sources. For example, we use around 80.000 barrels of oil in the world per day (Index Mundi, 2015) . As described, this is very environmentally unfriendly and furthermore fossil resources are not unlimited. Therefore, most people do agree that we have to take measures in order to promote renewable energy sources and to limit the use of fossil resources. However, the price of oil has almost halved in the last 5 years, which makes it a very cheap and therefore attractive energy source nowadays (Index Mundi, 2015) .
Solar panels with regular encapsulation layers
To protect the photovoltaic cells of a solar panel, solar panels require an encapsulation layer. They are mostly made from glasslike materials and they generally decrease the efficiency of the solar panels. The price is currently lower than the price of the microlens arrays.
Chemically produced microlens arrays
While the other forms of potential compaction are all substitutes, chemically produced microlens arrays can be considered as a direct competitor. The chemically produced MLAs are very environmentally unfriendly and expensive. The price can rise to hundreds of euros per cm2. However, it is expected that the price will decrease when the production volumes increase. Another drawback of the chemically produced MLAs compared to the biologically produced MLAs, is the size of the microlenses. The biological microlenses, with a size of less than 1 µm, will probably be smaller than the chemically produced alternatives.
Conclusion
We have compared the 4 alternatives in the field of price, efficiency, sustainability, the influence of the alternative on the environment and the acceptance among the public. The results can be found in Table 2.

TU_Darmstadt,2012,Team:TU Darmstadt#Project#Philosophy_-_-_TEXT.html,"ton, a reduction of PET would be in any case desirable. Degradation time for plastic is estimated with 450 years but there is no concrete knowledge. If we believe in this number then a use of PET degrading bacteria in industry or in a sewage treatment would not make the situation better. The amount of PET in the oceans would not be reduced. The only benefit is that it is not getting worse. The problem would not be solved. For lowering the concentration of PET in oceans we have to think of building organisms that degrades PET and can survive in marine environment. Experience gained in the use of green genetics (manipulation of plant genomes) show that consequences are not predictable. Results gained in labors cannot be used to set prognosis for field trials. Like already pointed, the complexity of global systems with its huge amount of influences and interactions is too high for humans to understand. There is no possibility to fulfill the claims of calculability or foreseeable consequences. Destruction of the whole ecological system is not excusable. Therefore an introduction into marine environment is not makeable. But what about the 450 years left? Can we just live with this situation without intervention? PET in the oceans has to be removed. In today’s society the best mechanism to stimulate people to act are financial benefits. Politics should promote the research on useful and inexpensive techniques to filter sea water. Focus should here lie on the one hand on effectiveness and on the other hand on compatibility with marine organisms. Filtered PET could then be transferred into Catechol. It seems that there is a long way to clean environment from human rubbish but anyway a first step has to be done. There is no time for waiting any longer. Waiting will make the situation worse for nature and for humankind.
d) Future orientation
Future orientation is one of the important aspects in a prospective technology assessment. In this part the technique will be evaluated on its sustainability. Sustainability means as well that no other future technologies are inhibited as life of humans is not restricted inappropriate. Another criterion for sustainability is that situation is getting better by using the technology.  Looking at possibilities which might arise in the future when using bacteria to degrade PET there can be seen an extension of the scope of action for man. New systems of recycling can emerge not only for minimizing damage but also to create additional economic attractions. Recycling can become a profitable part of industry. These new economic interests can be used to clean the world from human rubbish and save natural resources. The new principle from cradle to cradle can change industry in the way it adopts to natural cycles. The idea is to create a form of giving and taking"

IIT_Kharagpur,2015,Team:IIT Kharagpur#Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," in iGEM is always a challenge, especially if a team is doing it for the first time. There are a lot of logistical, financial and technical issues among many other grueling challenges that the teams face when they start out. Being beginners, we ourselves have faced many of these problems.
Hence, our second survey was targeted at the experienced iGEM teams across the world. By means of this survey, we planned to reach out to, and help those iGEM teams which are first-time participants and those students who plan to participate in the coming editions of iGEM. The data collected from this survey will help these teams get an idea of the challenges involved and the solutions adopted by experienced teams to tackle them and successfully conquer them. The ultimate objective of this survey is to encourage even more participation for iGEM in its future editions!
Based on the questions asked in the survey, some of the nice answers we received were as follows.
From your experience, what makes iGEM awesome?
Brainstorming to come up with ideas using theoretical knowledge and converting it into a feasible product that serves to the community issues all without any prior experience gives a lot to learn. Furthermore reading about the ideas of other iGEM teams gives a whole new dimension to the thought process.
If you were a member of the organizing team of iGEM, what changes would you like to bring about in the competition structure and why?
The competition is quite expensive; cost needs to be reduced in order for more teams to be able to participate and to increase budget for science as opposed to travel.
Has your participation in iGEM brought about any changes in your perspective? If yes, how?
Yes! It helped me understand how Biotechnology can be applied to cater different needs and to explain certain phenomenon. Moreover I have started taking curriculum seriously and started liking the class.
In your opinion, how can synthetic biology be an effective tool in affecting our lives and our future?
Synthetic biology can be used for production optimization in industries (like making ammonia though microbes which otherwise is a very harsh and energy consuming process-Haber's process ). Making low cost and highly effective products. Microbes can be viewed as miniature machines which are programmed by nature. Its ready-made and all we need to do is just provide the fuel (conditions and nutrients) and it will take care of the rest. So, employing them will surely affect our lives.
What are the problems you faced during your first-time participation and how did you solve them (in brief)?
Finding a project was hard. In retrospect, I think we should have kept it a bit simpler than trying to"

Hi there!
Welcome to our Wiki! I'm BaKillus, the pathogen-hunting microbe, and I'll guide you on this tour through our project. If you want to learn more about a specific step, you can simply close the tour and come back to it anytime you like. So let's start!
What's the problem?
First of all, what am I doing here? The problem is, pathogenic bacteria all around the world are becoming more and more  resistant against antimicrobial drugs. One major reason for the trend is the inappropriate use of drugs. With my BaKillus super powers, I want to reduce this misuse and thus do my part to save global health.
Sensing of pathogens
To combat the pathogenic bacteria, I simply eavesdrop on their communication. Bacteria talk with each other via quorum sensing systems, which I use to detect them and trigger my responses.
Adhesion
The more specific and effective I can use my powers, the lower the danger is of provoking new resistance development. So I catch pathogens whenever I get hold of them and stick to them until my work is done.
Killing
Talking about my work - killing pathogens is finally what I am made for. In response to quorum sensing molecules of the pathogens, I export a range of antimicrobial substances leading to dissipation of biofilms and the killing of the targeted bacteria.
Suicide switch
When the job is done and all the bad guys are finished, you don't need a super hero anymore. So after fulfilling my work I say goodbye to the world by activating my suicide switch.
Application
Of course I'm not only a fictional hero, but a very real one. In two different prototypes, I could be used for diagnosis or treatment of pathogen-caused diseases. However, there is still a whole lot of regulational and economical questions that have to be answered before.
See you!
So now you know my short story - and it is time for me to return to my fight for a safer world. Feel free to take a closer look on my super powers , the process of my development or the plans for a medical application .

OBSERVATIONS
When the Tamura was added, small liquid bubbles appeared on the surface of the HFIP. They looked kind of like oil bubbles on water
I think that the bubbles are water that isn't mixing with the HFIP
This makes no sense though -- Wikipedia states that HFIP is miscible with water
Other sources corroborate that HFIP should be miscible with water. After all, the main point of HFIP is that it's crazy strong at hydrogen bonding
Alternatively, maybe the bubbles are protein aggregates? They look so liquid though
After about an hour or so, there were two pieces that were still solid in the liquid
I poked at them with a pipette tip to try to push them and dissolve them
They behaved exactly like gels
After about another hour, the solid pieces still weren't dissolving, and the Tamura was just sitting on top of the solution.
I vortexed to try to dissolve the solid pieces and to mix the Tamura in. The same protocol by the Lewis group states that vortexing to mix the dope is ok
After about another hour, I tried to pipette the dope to place into the syringe
the damn dope had gelled up and I could not pipette it.

York_UK,2013,Team:York UK#Team.html_-_-_TEXT.html," Kobchai Duangrattanalert. Being a complex idea, it initially did not receive as much attention as other more “exciting” ideas like ‘Organic Lemon Grenades’ for example. One other idea– Bacterial Mouthwash– was taken up seriously by several future iGEMers and the forming team was split into two subunits for the first time and a competition of sorts was organised between the ideas. Eventually, the broad application of MFCs and the rather invasive character of Bacterial Mouthwash tilted the scales towards the former.
Who takes care of us?
University of York lecturers Dr. James Chong, Dr. Gavin Thomas and Prof. Maggie Smith were established as team supervisors. Our team benefited a lot from the help of other academics as well, namely Dr. James Edwards.
The joy of reading
It was now April - the long and grueling process of dry lab work and project design had begun! Team members had to read dozens of papers to get up to the level needed for such a complicated concept. We had regular briefing workshops where we would let our supervisors know how much progress we had made. Sponsorship requests were also sent during this time and an article in NOUSE, the University newspaper and website, was released with the aim of intriguing the potential iGEMers of next year.
The Survivors
Fourteen of us carried on to form the first iGEM team ever at the University of York. We are a good mix of biologists and biochemists, spanning from 1st to 4th year of studies, coming from:

UCAS-China,2018,Team:UCAS-China#People#safety_-_-_TEXT.html,".3 Inducible Gene Switch to Control essential gene:
Some essential genes in the genome are modified to be controlled by inducible promoters. In the controlled environment exist the molecules which activate the gene expression and provide the cell with basic substance, while in the uncontrolled environment the essential genes can not express and produce the basic substance and the bacteria cannot survive.
1.4 Gene Flow Barrier:
To avoid lateral gene transfer, the gene flow barrier is introduced into the bacteria. A plasmid containing ‘killer’ gene is transformed into the bacteria which can resist the toxin. When the genes are transferred into another cells in the uncontrolled environment, the toxin-resistance protein is not expressed and the bacteria will die.

2.1 The Introduction of Non-natural Chemicals into Nucleic Acids and Proteins
Figure 2. The introduction of non-natural chemicals into the central dogma(A)Unnatural amino acid; (B) unnatural nucleotide; (C) synthetic ligand
The main strategy of engineering non-natural amino acid-dependent organisms is to use directed evolution, to introduce aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase(ssRS), which encodes a specific non-natural amino acid, into the cells. Through the specific recognition of the stop codon(UAG), the targeted insertion of non-natural amino acids with special functions in the target protein is achieved. As for non-natural nucleotide, artificial base pairs such as Dx & Ps[3], Z & P[4], d5SICS-dMMO2[5] & d5SCICS-dNAM[6], have been developed to block the information transfer among bacteria in controlled and non-controlled environment. Furthermore, as the phenomenon of allosteric regulation of enzymes by ligands is widespread in organisms, synthetic ligands are also considered to be applied to contain the genetically modified organisms. And a directed evolution platform (SliDE) to screen has been established to screen for the accessory ligands which proteins require to function normally[7].
2.2 The Orthogonalization of Macromolecular Machines

Through the orthogonal design and modification of macromolecular machines in central dogma, the genetic information of the orthogonal system is not only isolated from the host organisms, but also blocked from other uncontrolled organisms. The orthogonaliztion of macromolecular"
