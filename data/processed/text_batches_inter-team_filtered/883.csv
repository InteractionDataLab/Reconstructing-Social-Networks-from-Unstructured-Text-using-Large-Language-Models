SVA-NYC,2015,Team:SVA-NYC#Measurement_-_-_TEXT.html," is taken of the absorbance for each wavelength then sorted from largest to smallest. The wavelength corresponding to the greatest absorbance sum is then selected to be used in a standard curve reading.
Standard Curve
The standard curve determines the linear relationship between a nutrient’s absorbance and it’s concentration in a medium. Once a wavelength has been established, it is entered into the “Standard Curve” feature or the Metaspec Pro’s software. The parameters for the standard are set as follows:
No. of WL – 1
Unit – ppm
No. of Std. Samples – 21
In the “Standard Sample List”, “Conc.” Is determined by the concentrations, in parts per million, labeled on the nutrient’s cuvettes. The machine is then zeroed again with the nutrient’s standard cuvette labeled “0.” As the absorbance is measured for each cuvette in the standard (including zero), a scatter plot is created that should increase linearly along with concentration. If the relationship in the standard curve is not linear, the reading should be performed again. The standard may need to be reprocessed and re-analyzed before quantitative analysis.
Quantitative Analysis
MetaSpec Pro’s “Quantitative Analysis” feature is used to determine the concentration of each nutrient in the collected soil samples. Quantitative analysis is performed by measuring the absorbance of each sample for each nutrient and applying the equation from the corresponding standard curve line. The linear equation calculated in the “Standard Curve” feature is transferred over to “Quantitative Analysis” and is selected from the “Standard curve method” option in the parameters. For each nutrient, the machine is zeroed again with the corresponding standard’s “0” and the soil samples’ absorbances are measured by the spectrophotometer. These data are then exported into excel to be graphed.

If you get too less colonies, you may think to increase the cycles to 20, but no more! Otherwise you might get mistakes in the final sequence.
You can try both Pfu and Herculase to perform muatgenesis. Pfu will give less yield but more fidelity, so you should preferably use Pfu. If you cannot succeed with Pfu then you can consider trying Herculase. Just keep the same protocol!

Our goal is to design and produce a multi-colored display, in which genetically engineered cells are electrically controlled to induce a fluorescent light response. In this process, calcium is one of the most important substances. To examine the calcium in the cell, a dynamic calcium model is designed. As a start, the basic calcium model of sympathetic ganglion 'B' type cells of a bullfrog is made in MATLAB and tested. This model is also used by the iGEM team of Valencia 2009 , however we gained more insights in the model by performing a sensitivity analysis. For a complete explanation of the model, view the bachelor thesis of Caroline Balemans , one of our team members.
The model
The model consists of the kinetics of an ionic current flow, the calcium buffers and the calcium pumps. We neglected the diffusion in this first attempt, because of the dependence on both space and time and the complexity to model this in MATLAB.
To simulate the model, realistic parameter values should be implemented. Therefore, all parameter values are taken from the book of reference [1] .
The value of the activation variable m, the concentration of the protein-calcium complex [CaB] and the concentration of the free calcium in the cell [Ca2+]
Sensitivity analysis
A local sensitivity analysis is performed to find out which parameters of the calcium model are most sensitive. The sensitivity of a parameter is here defined as the way the solution changes when the parameter is varied 10%. Because sensitivities are small, the right options for MATLAB's ode15s-solver must be used to get valid results from the sensitivity analysis.

So, for an undirected graph the adjacency matrix is symmetric. For the graph displayed in figure 3, the adjacency matrix is equal to:
$$ \boldsymbol{A} \ = \begin{bmatrix} 0 && 1 && 0 && 0 && 1 && 0 \\ 1 && 0 && 1 && 0 && 1 && 0 \\ 0 && 1 && 0 && 1 && 0 && 0 \\ 0 && 0 && 1 && 0 && 1 && 1 \\ 1 && 1 && 0 && 1 && 0 && 0 \\ 0 && 0 && 0 && 1 && 0 && 0 \end{bmatrix} $$
From the adjacency matrix and the weights of the edges, the resistance matrix can be calculated for connected weighted graphs. For a connected weighted graph G with n vertices, labelled {1, 2, …, n} and the weight assigned to edge (i,j) equal to w(i,j), the resistance matrix R is an n by n matrix where the coefficient \(r_{i,j}\) of the matrix is equal to the resistance distance between vertex i and vertex j [9]. The resistance distance between vertex i and vertex j is equal to the resistance between node i and node j in an electrical network, where the electrical network is constructed in such a way that it can be represented by G [9], [10]. This method also works for weighted graphs, where an edge (i,j) with weight w(i,j) can be represented by a resistor of w(i,j) Ω between node i and node j [9].
The following algorithm can be used to calculate the resistance matrix R with coefficients \(r_{i,j}\) for a connected weighted graph G with n vertices, labelled {1, 2, …, n}, the weight assigned to edge (i,j) equal to w(i,j) and A the adjacency matrix of G with coefficients \(a_{i,j}\) [9]:
Calculate the Laplacian matrix L of G, where L is an n by n matrix with coefficients \(l_{i,j}\). $$ l_{i,j} = \ \begin{cases} -\frac{1}{w(i,j)} \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \"

ATOMS-Turkiye,2015,Team:ATOMS-Turkiye#Attributions_-_-_TEXT.html,", we have carried out several collabrations with other iGEM teams.
 
As a Health and Medicine team we have contacted the UCL iGEM team and had a quite interesting conversation about the difficulty and our experiences of presenting a Health and Medicine project, especially at safety and ethics section of the project. After asking questions about their aspects of safety&ethics, we mentioned our way to outgo these problems: With the creating of a platform, called as Virtual Hospital, where we can be more imaginary and feel like our projects can be applied to today's medical approaches. (Visit 'Human Practise' to learn more about the Virtual Hospital). The UCL iGEM team acceptet this suggestion and mentioned, that they want to join our virtual hospital.
 
Also we mentored the AUC Turkey iGEM High School team this year and guided them during their experiments to increase their possibility of achieving their set goals.
 
Additionally, we have carried out an iGEM Rhizi Collaboration with iGEM Paris Bettencourt, were our team is getting connected to other iGEM teams with same communalities and were we got a badge for participating in their iGEM Rhizi."

SpyTag-ELP5-SnoopCatcher for elastomeric tissue
This part can be used to form an elastomeric tissue. The elastin like protein ELP5 as the main part has a SpyTag and a SnoopCatcher at its end to be able to bind its counterpart ""SnoopTag-ELP5-SpyCatcher"". Those two kind of proteins can build long polymer chains which can form an elastomeric tissue i.e. for the application as the basic tissue of artificial muscles.

This part can be used to express conductive pili of Geobacter Sulfurreducens in E.coli bacteria. Since the cultivation of Geobacter Sulfurreducens is difficult due to its strictly anaerobic demand, the expression of the pili in E.coli is the more convenient. The pili can then be used i.e. as the conductive layers of a dielectrical elastomeric actuator for the application of an artificial muscle.

    Human practice is one of iGEM’s most important features that makes the competition very different from the other. This year, Team Tsinghua-A organized a series of activities based on their own understanding of what human practice is. All the activities share some common characteristics.
    Interaction oriented——Team members engage all stakeholders by idea exchange.
    The thought of “all”——We want to create science culture for the whole society to help community members to stay creative and productive. Therefore, our activities include people from all generations.
    Balance between “rigorous” and “interesting”—— the nature of science is rigorous, while we can make it as interesting as possible to make science accessible for ordinary people. How to balance between those two aspects can be a meaningful question to explore.
    Tsinghua-A has been thinking about what their projects can bring to the world before they picked up the first pipette in lab. As one of our initial goal stands, we would like to make science a resource beyond universities and institutes and create science culture for our community. To reach this goal, we put forward our interesting project to the public and are curious to see what effect can be sparked out of the interaction. What can science bring to the public and what science gets in return is an interesting topic that we would like to explore.

1. The Markerless Gene Replacement Method for Bacillus amyloliquefaciens LL3.
Abstract
This is a markerless gene replacement method that combines a temperature-sensitive plasmid pKSV7 with a counter-selectable marker, the upp gene encoding uracil phosphoribosyltransferase (UPRTase) for the Bacillus amyloliquefaciens LL3. This method allows us to adapt a two-step plasmid integration and excision strategy to perform markerless deletion of genes.
  Click on Me
Introduction
The temperature-sensitive plasmid pKSV7 of Bacillus can replicate at 30°C normally, but the plasmid will be lost at 42°C. Combined the plasmid with a counter-selectable marker, the markerless gene replacement method can be constructed.
The upp gene encodes uracil phosphoribosyl transferase (UPRTase), which makes U transfer to UMP. Thus, cell can use extrinsic uracil via the following pathway 5-FU ➔ 5F(fluorin)-UMP ➔ 5-F-dUMP. Since the products of this pathway are toxic, cellular growth can be restrained. If upp gene is knocked out, bacteria can resist 5-FU toxicity.
Figure 1
Procedures
Δupp Bacillus amyloliquefaciens LL3 was constructed, which can resist 5-fluorouracil.
Construction of the upp cassette: An 850 bp DNA fragment carrying the upp gene with its 5' regulatory region and its 3'; transcription terminator was generated by PCR from B. subtilis 168 genomic DNA using primers upp -F and upp -R. After digesting with KpnI and BamHI, the fragment was cloned in the KpnI –BamHI site of pKSV7. The resulting counter-selective plasmid was designated pKSU.
The target gene was selected. The upstream sequence A and downstream sequence B of target gene were combined by over-lapping PCR and ligated into plasmid pKSU.
Plasmid pKSU is a temperature sensitive plasmid, which replicates at 30"

Bring Biological Modeling to the Next Level
Chain-Node Model (Figure. 1) is a brand new Complex Modeling Concept incorporating its detailed structure description with universal applicability. Instead of treating complex as a whole while ignoring their basic composition and structure, Chain-Node Model view complex as a construction of it basic Parts . Just as its name implies, our model includes two components: Chain and Node. As a correspondence to natural polymer chains, each Chain consists of an arrangement of its basic unit, Part, whose concept has been greatly extended and includes but not limited to Biobrick Parts. The Node component is not a natural correspondence but an abstract concept to describe binding states of two or more parts: each binding will create a Node.

Week 1: May 12 - 16
This week we spent most of our time doing a literature search on potential systems to recognize DNA sequences. One potential system included homologous recombination - homologous sequences being a) the PCR-amplified target pathogen DNA and b) a specific region of genomic (or plasmid) DNA; homologous recombination would activate a genetic circuit leading to expression of a reporter. The other potential system would be via cis-repressed mRNA - mRNA would become ‘readable’ (i.e. repression would be released) upon hybridization with the complementary target pathogen DNA sequence. We also looked at potential promoters for B. subtilis that are repressible, as well as  potential reporters, such as chromoproteins and enzymes which produce coloured products, to use in our reporter system.
We were also able to clone several iGEM registry parts (RFP, eCFP, GFP, YFP, pTetR, pLacI, RBS, RFP-generator, and a ‘double terminator’). RFP, eCFP, GFP and YFP were cloned to be used as reporters. The pTetR and pLacI were cloned to be later used as binding sites for our reporter system.
Week 2: May 19 - 23
Again, we spent more time on literature research, specifically in regards to the proposed detection strategies; mRNA cis-repression and homologous recombination. We read more about the detailed mechanisms involved in homologous recombination. We learned"

there was made a controllgel of virA for our basicproduct, purification and nanodrop
the two ligations X+K were checked and electroporated
X was digested again and ligated in K
There were fluid cultures made for ligation of Y+K
A new PCR was done for rpoA mutagenesis : elongationstep was now taken 4 minutes instead of 1 minute

7.8 Mutagen Concentration Test - Fourth Protocol
I) Purpose
To test the forth protocol for applying 5-bromodeoxyuridine and inducing mutation.
II) Expected Outcome
- A decrease in phage viability with increasing mutagen concentration.
- A few random mutations that produces smaller phage and consequently larger plaques during selection with x8 agar.
III) Reagents Used
5-bromodeoxyuridine stock in freezer labeled T7 (10mg/mL); 50mL of M9+ prepared by the large phage group; BL21 overnight; 5.3 phage stock; x8 top agar; uracil solution (2.5mg/mL); adenine solution (5mg/mL).
IV) Procedure
1) Applying the mutagen (7.8)
- From 5.13 Determining E coli concentration with spectrophotometer, we know that the concentration of E coli BL21 in a liquid overnight culture is about 3.12E8 cell/mL. But we need to resuspend it in M9+ medium.
- To make the M9+ suspension medium supplemented with the appropriate amount of uracil and adenine, 200uL of adenine solution and 400uL of uracil was add 50mL of M9+.
- Label 5 centrifuge tubes (15mL) 0, 100, 200, 500, and C (control). To each of these test tubes, add 10 mL of E coli overnight. Cells were then pelleted via centrifuge at "

NHR Introduction
Phthalate Biosensor
BPA Biosensor
Diauxie Elimination by Xylose Inducible Promoters
Microorganisms typically preferentially utilize glucose over other sugar carbon sources such as xylose. This is largely regulated through control of gene expression based on the response of regulatory elements to sugars available to the cell. In E. coli, the xylose metabolism operon is controlled by both the xylose-inducible XylR activator protein and the cAMP receptor protein (CRP). In this project we attempt to eliminate glucose control over xylose-inducible gene expression in E. coli by altering the natural transcriptional control region of the xylose operon. Designs constructed and tested include scrambling the CRP binding site, increasing the strength of the xyl promoter, and overexpressing XylR. Xylose-inducible gene expression that functions independently of glucose regulation provides a useful approach to improving microbial utilization of biomass feedstocks containing mixtures of glucose and xylose.
Hormone Prescreening with E. coli
Two of our projects aim to construct biosensors which will ultimately serve as a water prescreening tool.  The focus of these biosensors will be to detect phthalate compounds using the Peroxisome Proliferator Activated Receptor (PPAR) and detecting Bisphenol A (BPA) by the Estrogen Receptor (ER). The idea is explored in-depth in our NHR Biosensors Introduction
""Smart Fold"" Pthalate Biosensor
This Phthalate Biosensor project uses altered growth conditions so that the entire hPPARα protein is successfully expressed in E. coli and used to transcriptionally report for the presence of phthalates in liquid solution. Rather than changing the receptor and possibly losing its usefulness, we are chemically optimizing the cell environment. Check out our Overview to find out how.
""Nuclear Fusion"" BPA Biosensor
The Nuclear Fusion project involves a plasmid construct very generously donated to our iGEM team from David W. Wood, Department of Chemical Engineering at Princeton University.  Research in their lab has constructed a biosensor containing just the ligand binding domain (LBD) of the estrogen receptor (ER)."

Prof. Paul Groundwater
Professor of Medicinal Chemistry - University of Sydney
Professor Paul Groundwater is Professor of Medicinal Chemistry at the Sydney School of Pharmacy. His research interests include the design and synthesis of novel agents for the treatment of cancer and psoriasis; the identification of the active principle of medicinal plants; and new methods for the detection of bacteria.
We approached Prof. Groundwater to discuss the potential future applications of our scaffold with regards to drug synthesis and possible drug delivery applications. His research into the synthesis of novel agents made him an excellent person to ask for suggestions of which aspects of the pharmaceutical synthesis industry that our system could add benefit to. His interest in cancer treatment also meant we could get his opinion on the use of scaffolds for drug delivery. Prof. Groundwater thought highly of our scaffold and agreed that it would have useful applications to pharmaceutical synthesis. Coming from a chemistry-based background he wasn’t as aware of work with protein scaffolds for reaction optimisation, but he felt that there was great potential.
He highlighted the significance of stereogenic centres as a key candidate for metabolic engineering tools. Many drugs available to consumers have an inflated price due to the industrial synthesis of the compounds resulting in the costly and ineffective separation of the required enantiomers from that with undesirable or potentially toxic chiral structure. Being able to synthesise these drugs through a biocatalytic pathway would remove the need for resolution of the desired compound, potentially reducing the cost of synthesis. He linked us a paper that outlined some chemoenzymatic processes for the synthesis of chiral intermediates for the development of pharmaceuticals.
In particular, he mentioned the synthesis of paclitaxel (brand name Taxol) which is a semi-synthetic anti-cancer therapeutic, that is very costly to produce. He highlighted that this was mostly the result of the difficulty to synthetically manufacture the taxol side-chain which is required for the drugs targeted action. He prompted us to look further into this pathway, which was significant in assisting in the turning point of our project away from the indole-3-acetic acid pathway, towards paclitaxel side-chain synthesis.
He also suggested that we look into the synthesis of the antimicrobial agent, Levofloxacin,"

Summary
Our team aims to fully exploit our university’s advantage in pharmaceutical science to design an effective treatment of a disease. By comparing the data collected, we chose rheumatoid arthritis and other refractory autoimmune diseases for our project. Conducting thorough field studies and understanding the current clinical status of rheumatoid arthritis were very important to our design and optimization.
Through field studies, we knew that Syn-Notch CAR-Treg cell therapy satisfies the patient's desire for new                 therapies, and through a questionnaire survey of physicians, we concluded that Syn-Notch CAR -Treg cell therapy                 just hold the advantages of the minor side effects and lower recurrence rate compared to existing drug treatment.                 In designing the therapeutic method, we were also fully dependent on the patient's request for new therapies                 to meet current clinical needs.
We actively design, perfect and verify our own project. In the meantime, it is an opportunity for every                 single person to understand the competition, together with a new frontier in life science. What’s more, we                 communicate with other iGEM teams and help each other.In addition, all of the members actively organized                 various academic activities, and actively participated in disparate meetings inside and outside school to                 promote the majority of teachers and students to comprehend the field of life science, as well as to improve                 the international influence of iGEM. At the same time, it also made our team members accumulate cutting-edge                 knowledge, and provided a strong guarantee for the improvement of the subject

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory disease that may exhibit chronic synovitis, synovial hyperplasia and fibrosis, mononuclear cell infiltration, synovial fluid T, B lymphocytes and plasma cells, increased collagenase, etc. It’s a chronic disease with high morbidity. There are several new therapies that have been used for the treatment of RA, but due to low awareness and low recovery rate, many patients fail to receive a proper treatment in RA’s preliminary stage which not only afflicts the patients, but also brings a heavy financial burden to"

Dialogue& our reflection
1. From an old man
    I can’t fully understand what these are about. Is synthetic biology similar to transgene? Will the bacteria in it be harmful?
2. From a teacher
    Wow! The concept of synthetic biology is very innovative! I never think about biology can also use the idea of engineering. Could you introduce it to my students? It will be great for them to know more about STEM in that way.
3. From high school student
    I’m rather interested in your biological cipher machine. Bacteria and the cipher, I never thought about two unrelated things could be integrated. What do you think it could do in the real world?
4. From kids
    he kids were attracted by the decoding game we designed, and asked us to tell them more about the story in the video.
5. From some youth
    1) I think your idea is very interesting, but I felt a little hard to understand it. Could you recommend some books for me to learn more? (We introduced some books introducing basic synthetic biology to her.)
    2) As you base your project on bacteria, there might be some difficulties. What if the bacteria is dead or the protein degenerates?
    2) As you base your project on bacteria, there might be some difficulties. What if the bacteria is dead or the protein degenerates?
    3) Your introduction of encryption and decryption are very interesting, just like opening a door to the new world for me. Things about biological cipher machine are creative, though I do not fully understand.
    4) Actually I do not expect to understand all of this, but I just do! Wow, that’s very interesting. And the idea of synthetic biology is great. I never heard of it before.
    5) If I want to decode a long list of letter, your machine is not capable. Do you have some future plan of this aspect?
    These feedbacks are the epitome of wonder and concern about synthetic biology. The old rejected things that may change their life instinctively, and were very serious about biosafety. The teacher welcomed the new idea of synthetic biology, and want to"

""What I cannot create I do not understand.""
- Richard Feynmann
Awareness
In our opinion it is very important that synthetic biology gets attention in the public. People should talk about synthetic biology and learn how useful it can be. To reach as many people as possible and explain them the benefits of synthetic biology we published an article about our education project in a regional newspaper. This article is not only about the human practices education project, but also about what synthetic biology is and how it can be used to help people. We hope to decrease prejudices people might have against synthetic biology, and to enhance acceptance. A second article was published in the ETH-student magazine , which reaches thousands of students of various disciplines. That way we hope to show them what iGEM is about and to motivate them for a possible future participation.
Summary
To get the publics attention we did the following:
We published an article about our human practices school project in the newspaper . This article also explains what synthetic biology is and why it can be so useful.
Together with the team of EPF Lausanne wie did a survey in the streets of basel and asked people to tell us their opinion about synthetic biology.
We published an article (link) in the ETH student magazine polykum which reaches a lot of students of various disciplines"
NTNU_Trondheim,2014,Team:NTNU Trondheim#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," 26th showed only one band corresponding to the length of a backbone (~2000 bp). Normally, the gel would run for 50 minutes at 80 V, but because of the length of JB (47 bp), it was set to run only 30 minutes. However, despite the shorter run-time, no band corresponding to JB was seen. GelGreen binds DNA and visualises it. We assume that shorter DNA segments binds less GelGreen, which would make the absence of a JB band on the gel understandable. We therefore assumed that the JB ligation was a success despite the failed verification. JB ligation to LF and psB1A3 backbone showed growth the next day.

A different enzyme was used for the gel verification process because gel verification thus far had been prone to errors. We speculated that the difference in enzyme activity of EcoRI-HF, PstI-HF, SpeI and XbaI could have caused uneven cutting of the plasmids, which could have produced erroneous bands.
The agarose gel of NotI-HF digested {RF, Kan, psB1A3} and {J,B, psB1A3} showed bands at around 1000 bp for all samples, which is wrong in both cases.

Astrid does many things, she started as a bookworm who shaped our plasmid, worked in the lab, made plans for the symposium and visited schools to explain children about synthetic biology.
Eline started working on gaining sponsors for our project. Then she made the collaboration with Toulouse possible by creating a diffusion model in COMSOL. In the end she helped with the wiki.
Frederik's background in economics made him the perfect guy to acquire sponsors for our project. He created the survey. He explored several applications and wrote an economical report about it.
Ines discovered the world of social media to inform people about our project. When she isn't updating the public she can be found in the lab or behind her books.
Jasper is the brains behind our internal model. Apart from modeling he found time to invent, create and adjust our card game.
Laetitia delegated the lab work, planned frequent meetings, wrote new protocols and filled in our lab safety form. Additionally she provided general texts for the wiki.
Convincing people and companies to invest in our project became Laura's personal challenge, this included making the sponsor brochure and folder. Beside you can also find her in the lab.
Laurens started as our personal Photoshop hero who somehow still found time to 'GO TO THE LAB'. So he became our part-time Photoshop hero and part-time lab buddy.
With her background in web design, Leen was the ideal member to create our wiki. The whole summer she spent time on creating new pages, fixing mistakes and expanding our wiki.
Moritz was the first of our model team to finish his colony level model. He also contributed PDE-solvers and helped getting the wiki ready in time, the Outreach section in particular.
Ovia had the difficult task to ensure communication within the team. When she isn't working in the lab she provides us with beautiful images for the stickers and our wiki.
Thomas is our hybrid model specialist. He was the connection between lab and modeling so all the necessary information was passed trough.
In the beginning Vincent was the designated bookworm who browsed trough literature at full speed. When enough information was gathered he used this knowledge in the lab.

Cette BioBrick peut être utilisée pour contrôler un mécanisme de rétrocontrôle qui induit le cycle lytique du phage Lambda (Link plasmide Wiki).
Dans E.coli, pLac fait partie de l’opéron lactose. LacI est constamment exprimé et réprime pLac. En présence de Lactose, LacI est inhibé et pLac est actif et permet la transcription de beta-galactosidase. Le Lactose peut être substitué par IPTG (Isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside).
Cette BioBrick contient déjà un fort RBS pour induire directement la transcription d’un gène.
P1003 + B0014
Cette BioBrick contient une cassette de résistance à la kanamycine et un double terminateur (BBa_P1003 + BBa_B0014). Ce qui permet à la cassette kanamycine d’être fonctionnelle.
La cassette peut être utilisée pour créer un vecteur recombinant par insertion d’un gène dans un bactériophage non lytique comme le phage Lambda.
En fait, il permet de savoir si le bactériophage est modifié ou non et si l’insert est exprimé ou non. Lorsque le virus est modifié, la cassette kanamycine induit une résistance à la kanamycine, donc la bactérie devient résistante. Lorsqu’elles ne sont pas modifiées les bactéries sont tuées par la kanamycine.
Cette BioBrick est complétée par B0014 + P1003 + B0014 pour finir la transcription avant la cassette de résistance.

INSA-Lyon,2014,Team:INSA-Lyon#molecular_-_-_TEXT.html," provide the program with a pdb file, which is a file that gives the spatial coordinates of every atom in the molecule. However, curli are extremely stable and hard to characterize so there aren't a lot of publication that were able to fully characterize its shape, let alone define its spatial features with certainty. Thus we weren't able to find any such file in the banks we searched, be it the protein data bank, uniprot, and many others. We only managed to get a pdb file of the CsgA protein thanks to the generosity of professor M. Chapman from the University of Michigan, who sent us his work and to whom we are really grateful.image CsgA
To work on the protein, we mainly used two functions of Sybyl-X :
the minimize option, that searches for the minimum steric hindrance of the protein;
what we called a ""dynamic"", that is a simulation of the behavior of the protein under a set of conditions such as a magnetic force field (that can represent the effect of water for instance).
These tools were used once the His-tag and/or nickel ions were added, showing the behavior of the protein with these new elements around it.
However, keep in mind that when adding new atoms or amino acid, their position is totally arbitrary, they can be put wherever and however we want around the protein. It means that what is observed once is far from being enough to conclude, since it is very possible that the result would be different by placing them even a slight bit differently. Thus we had to run a lot of simulations and analyse and compare their results before we could conclude. And since both minimisation and dynamics take a lot of time, and since we could only run one simulation at a time, the whole study spread over several weeks.
CsgA Engineering
The first step of the study was to determine the behavior of the CsgA protein once tagged with a poly-His peptid. Hence we ran several simulations as described above with both His1-tag and His2-tag, in C-terminus position but also inserted in a loop between two beta strands, to see if it had any kind of impact on the molecular structure or if inserting the tag in the middle of the sequence may cause a problem on the structural level. Although the parts had already been conceived with the tags in C-terminus, it was interesting to be able to make the comparison for future considerations.
Results
In C-terminus
The first observation we can make is that two main conformations of the tags came out of the simulations : it could either fold along the side of Csg"

After transformation, the cells are plated on selection medium. It contains IPTG, which makes the lac repressor inactive and allows expression of the lacZ gene. In addition, X-Gal is included, which is split by the ß-galactosidase in a blue product (Burn 2012) . This means that the white colonies have integrated the plasmid with insert and the blue colonies without insert.      This simple method makes it quick and easy to see which are the right colonies that you can pick. Our big goal is to make this method usable for the VibriClone as well. This would give you a huge time advantage through the rapid growth of V. natriegens and the rapid recognition of the result.       After many rounds of designing, and engineering Vibrio natriegens to a suitable clone strain, we now have VibriClone in our hands, with all properties for a perfect cloning host, such as nuclease deficience, recA mutation, cold resistance and the ability for blue white screening.
We want to make our strain accessible to the whole iGEM community by providing the opportunity to request our VibriClone strain, to enable all future iGEM Teams to accelerate their projects with the next generation cloning chassis.
VibriExpress
Nowadays the production of high protein amounts is important for biotechnological and industrial uses. One of the widely used expression hosts is E. coli in combination with the T7 expression system. For the last century, the performance of E. coli was hugely satisfying, except of issues like the aggregation of inclusion bodies and the insolubility of some proteins (Villaverde & Carrio 2003) .        However, in the last years, scientific progress is getting faster and faster and it is time to question if there is an alternative to E. coli, a host that is keeping up with the time?
Imagine you could start a day early in the morning performing a transformation with your construct. After several hours, you could inoculate colonies in liquid culture and induce the expression of your desired protein in an overnight culture. The second day you would be able to purify your protein.            Using V. natriegens as a new host with its impressive doubling time and the ability to grow to a much higher cell density will arise new possibilities for molecular and synthetic biology. In order to do so, we will design the VibriExpress strain.

Thessaloniki,2018,Team:Thessaloniki#Model#dCas9_-_-_TEXT.html," reagent for the formation of the                                 complex R, which by extension has a maximum concentration of                                 acn. Specifically its concentration is given below
with Notice                                 that R is independent of the copy number c.
We can now replace R in (2) and get
Likewise if sgRNA is the limiting reagent, that is for Replacing the corresponding R to (2) we end up with the                                 following relationship
proving that for R, which is scaling proportionally to copy                                 number increments, expression of G is independent of the copy                                 number variation.
Figure 9: On the y axis the concentrations of dcas9, sgRNA and by                         extension, the repressor’s are presented. On the x axis we have copy                         number variation. The concentration concerns the steady state of the                         system for every copy number.
From the graphical representation, we can easily tell, that sgRNA indeed                     surpasses the level of dcas concentration at copy number 50. Thus, after                     that -let’s name it- breaking point, the repressor is constant for the                     remaining copy numbers, with dcas9 acting as the limiting reagent. It is                     obvious that, we had to change the repressor amount so as to be increased                     for increasing copy number. This could be achieved by either increasing                     dcas9 concentration or decreasing sgRNA’s one. We chose the latter option,                     because, as we concluded in dcas subsystem section, the amount of dcas is                     already enough and if increased, due to its toxicity it could be a problem                     for the cell’s growth.
In Fig. 10 we present the fixation of copy number variation. For a kd of 10                     raised to the power of 4 we can see that dcas9 becomes the restriction                     reagent for high copy numbers. It is important to mention, that changing                     the binding affinity is difficult as it requires to change also the                     promoter and different promoters have discrete amount of affinity. This can                     be solved by changing the Rhamnose dose for small changes needed. Though                     the amount of Rhamnose should be small to make a difference because this time the limiting reagent is RhaS and its concentration is very small.                     We were able to make the aforementioned kd value stay under dcas9                     concentration barrier, by providing Rhamnose near the value of 150 nM or                     lower.

Instead, under OSHA (Occupational Safety and Health Administration), they are only required to address any health concerns a specific organism might pose.
Australia
Currently there are no limits to worker exposure to biological agents. However, employers are required under the Occupational Health and Safety Act 2004 to provide a safe working environment that minimizes health risks. This can include providing information, supervision, training and protective equipment (if necessary). A risk assessment must also be performed and the employer must take required measures to reduce these risks.
Brazil
There are no rules regarding specifically the exposure to biological agents; the employers must monitor the exposure levels under the same rules for other substances (Act 3214/1978).
Japan
In Japan, the Ministry of Health and Welfare established The standard of manufacture management and quality management of biological agents and The standard of structure facility of manufacturing place of biological agents. In this standard, there are several safety measures of workers.
A. Keep good hygiene of workers
Don't let irrelevant people come inside the workplace.
Make workers wear disinfected shoes, working clothings, working caps, and working masks.
Make workers follow the rules when going in the workplaces that handles different microorganism or biological agents.
Don't let workers who are engaged in manufacture step manage animals.
Provide vaccines and other infection prevention measures when necessary, and make workers get medical check up on a regular basis.
If making biological agents using people's blood or plasma, provide vaccine of Hepatitis B virus etc. to workers if necessary.
B. Manage hygiene of workers in a sterilised zone or clean zone
Check if workers are not in a dangerous condition by microorganism pollution or other reasons.
Let workers get medical check ups every 6 months.

Ministry of Health by the Public Health Institute (ISP) provides the following services:
Generation of protocols for risks and exposure evaluation.
Specific actions over biological agents and disinfection.
Elaboration of guides for reception, manipulation, transport and biological agents diffusion in the labour place.
Generation of new protocols associated with the area as elimination and disposal of dangerous biological residues.
Certification of bio-clean areas, biohazards control zones and sampling of viable bioparticules.
General requirements for biological agents manipulation:
Use of personal protection equipment (PPE) according to the activity (D.S. N°173/82 by Health Ministry).
The PPE must not hinder in the work done. Workers must be informed about the right use of PPE before to start working.

Script Revision
The PCR machine modification took a lot longer than initially anticipated since the machine was having difficulties successfully locating all the materials it required. To fix this, I rewrote the script using a different method to check for inventory inside the object and I now check for the existence of the items that are needed within individual lists at three points rather that two to prevent any mistakes that were being made previously. One positive outcome of taking the time to make these changes is that now a list may contain things that it does not necessarily require to complete the activity meaning more options may be added when they are required. It also makes the script less bulky so I believe that when I have the time I will change the whole script to run just like the PCR activity with a general DNA template.
I am now tempted to go back to restriction digest and change the script, since my initial method appears to only work well within a less complicated script, so I believe I will return to that at a later date as well. I am selecting the substrings I will need from a single note card for comparing the parts that are going to be ligated together. So far I have determined the substrings of sequences for all promoters, rbs and terminators cut to be inserted behind or in front of another part and now have moved on to the gene that will be used for the lab missions.
I was able to get my DNA polymerase to successfully detect an RNA primer and rez nucleotides after the collision for a little while. I have now made a primase to rez the RNA primers and now I have to determine where on the strand they should be rezzed along the lagging strand. I am also considering animating the open strands of DNA so that initially, the single strands are together and then come apart, which will send a message to gyrase and helicase to initiate their own activities, which"

Sequence for msr-msd transcript from EC86 retron, with specific PAM sequence for Cas1-Cas2 recognition.The msd-msr is transcribed as a single RNA sequence and interacts with the Retrotranscriptase (RT) EC86 protein to form an RNA-DNA chimera. The msr serves as a primer for the RT to start the retrotranscription, and the msd is the part of the transcript that is converted back into DNA. The msd is composed of a conserved part and a variable part. The conserved part is needed for retrotranscription and retron stability, while the variable part may be changed for any sequence of interest. In this part, the variable part of the msd contains an improved sequence that have high integration rates in the CRISPR array by adaptation proteins Cas1 and Cas2.
Composite Parts
New Parts: Cas1-Cas2 proteins: BBa_K2761007, BBa_K2761009
The composite parts BBa_K2761007 and BBa_K2761009 hold an IPTG-inducible promoter regulating the expression of each Cas1 and Cas2 proteins. The first part produces each protein with a FLAG and HA tags, respectively, the second one produces them as wild-type proteins. The expression of the proteins was characterized, quantifying them with a gradient of inductor concentration and under different induction times. These are new characterized parts for Silver requirements. The characterization of the part can be found in the Demonstrate segment.
Improved Part: RT & msd-msr: BBa_K2761010
The composite part BBa_K2761010 holds an IPTG-inducible promoter regulating the expression of a retrotranscriptase and the msr-msd transcript. The expressed RT comes with a histidine tag. The RT cassette for the new parts were improved from Part BBa_K1681000 by iGEM Team UIUC Illinois. However, the new parts are designed with a different msr-msd transcribed under a separate promoter cassette. The expression of the protein was characterized, quantifying it with a gradient of inductor concentration and under different induction times. This characterized part is an improvement of a previous part for Gold requirements. The characterization of this part can be found in the Demonstrate segment.
Improved Part:Nitrate inducible promoter: BBa_K2761011

Biological molecules are unique in that once they are built and viable they never need to be repaired.  Once a biofactory is synthesized to produce a metabolite all that needs to be done is to grow it, feed it, and harvest the product.  This is very cheap compared to producing a chemical via traditional methods.  In a chemical plant, if one link in the chain fails than the process must be halted and repaired.  In a biological production system, since all cells are for the most part independent from each other, if one cell fails there is no damage to the overall system.  Also, biological molecules reproduce very fast and cheaply as oppose to chemical factories which are built very slowly and expensively. - Bussingkm 14:54, 9 June 2009 (UTC)
I think that these passages put things into a nice perspective. In this Commentary, we consider the historical role of synthetic approaches in the development of modern organic chemistry in order to extract some lessons that might help guide the development of synthetic biology. A critical lesson here is that a complete understanding of chemical principles was not a prerequisite for the emergence of synthetic chemistry. The history of organic chemistry suggests that synthesis will be a necessary complement to analysis in order for biologists to truly understand the mechanisms of complex living systems. - Bussingkm 14:54, 9 June 2009 (UTC)

I like the point made that systems biology can help synthetic biologists design systems that will have to function in the context of biological variability (aka evolution).

Experiment: Assembly of Nat1 plasmid.
The plated colonies didn't look great, so we chose the least red colonies and ran them on a colony PCR.
In parallel, since the results seemed very poor, we have redone the digestion and ligation, but this time we are using other enzymes. We suspect that PstI may not be able to cut our Nat1 fragment, as our primer design hadn't allowed for extra bases following the cut site. We therefore used EcoRI and SpeI as our enzymes. In addition to using other enzymes, we also tried to use a linearized backbone from the distribution kit to see if that could increase the success-rate.
Experiment: Colony PCR on overnight cultures.
A total of 4 white colonies (N1,N2,N31 & N32) were discovered on the three plates for NAT1 transformants. A standard verification primer Onetaq was performed on these cultures and they were run on a gel.

Procedure
Preparation of Materials
For 2*200 ml of bacterial culture:
Prepare minimum 420 ml of LB medium and autoclave for 20 min at 121ºC
Autoclave tips and dishes, which will be used for bacteria growth
Prepare minimum 120 ml buffer A (- DTT)
Prepare minimum 3 ml buffer A + DTT
Bacteria growth
When working with bacteria, always work next to the flame to avoid contaminations and wear glasses when working with liquid nitrogen.
At 17h approximatively, add 5 ml of LB medium and antibiotics according to resistance’s cells to a tube and inoculate with a small amount of desired bacteria from the glycerol stock (pick by tip or inoculating loop). Put the top of the bottle of the LB and the cap under the flame to avoid contamination of LB medium (contaminate very easily).
Grow the culture overnight at 37°C, 200rpm, pay attention to keep the lid loose to allow for air exchange.
At 9h approximately, measure absorbance at 600 nm with 10X dilution of the culture (900 μl of LB + 100 μl of bacteria culture) in a plastic cuvette, OD600 should be around 4.
Add 1 ml overnight culture to 200 ml of LB medium and correct antibiotics in a 500 ml Erlenmeyer flask.
Incubate the culture for 2 hours at 37°C, 200 rpm (pay attention to the rpm setting – this speed is optimal for the growth).
Induce if necessary: 400 μl of 100 mM IPTG for T7 polymerase inducing; 5 ml of 10% arabinose for gamS inducing (under pBAD promoter).
Incubate again the culture for 2 hours at 37°C, 20 0rpm and measure absorbance, OD600 should be around 1.5 – 2.
Centrifugation and cleaning
Let the big centrifuge cool down to 4ºC (takes around 10 min).
Weigh one 50 ml falcon tube for one culture (clearly label the tube as well the cap).
Separate the grown culture to four 50 ml falcon tubes and spin at 4000 rpm at 4°C for 20 min.
Keep the bacteria on ice as much as possible.
Discard the supernatant and add 10 ml of buffer A to the bacteria pellet, re-suspend the bacteria by pipetting or by vortexing and transfer all four parts"

Blog #14 - Students Explore Careers in Synthetic Biology
By NBailly 21:11, June 12 2014 (CDT)
Our ""Synthetic Biology"" teaching module has come to an end. Today was our last day at Kaiser-Karl-Gymnasium in Aachen, where we have worked together with a grade 9 biology-chemistry class for past 1 1/2 months. The students have learned about the iGEM and synthetic biology in general. We presented our project to the class, and explained various aspects for our endeavour in more detail.
To give interested students some overview of how they can get involved in synthetic biology, Vera, Florian, Ansgar and Björn gave short presentations about each university program at RWTH represented in our team: Biology, Biotechnology, Computational Engineering Science and Informatics, respectively. We gave them examples for typical classes and specialization options as well as career perspectives in each program.
While discussing some more career perspectives, we handed an evaluation sheet out to each student. This way the class could give us some feedback about our work, and leave some comments on what they liked best and what we can still improve on. On average, the students gave us an A (1,9 or 87%) for the teaching module. We are really happy about this great mark, and will try to improve on all the things the students suggested.
Unfortunately, the bell already rang when the students finished handing in their evaluation sheets. However, some students still followed our invitation to stay after class to ask more questions about paths into synthetic biology, and for some cookies.
Overall, all parties seemed really satisfied with our collaboration and we are looking forward to repeating the teaching module with other high school classes"

Expectations:
The expected results were to detect GFP fluorescence under a fluorescent microscope. It could be assumed that if the experiment was conducted well, the HEK cells would be able to harbor the GFP containing plasmid and fluorescence would be high. One could have hoped that some of the cell-lines of our experimetns would also show fluorescence. If there was a problem during the experiment or in the quantities of the materials, it would not be possible to see fluorescence in the HEK cells or we would see a high cell mortality rate.
Results:
All the cell types survived the transfection process –no significant death rate was noticed.
In the HEK cells used as control indeed there was an expression of the GFP.
No GFP was detected in the microglia nor the astrocyte cells in all groups of transfection.
Discussion:
The purpose of the experiment was to introduce a fluorescent gene into microglia and astrocytes using the HEK cells as control. Because fluorescence illumination is obtained in the control cells, it is assumed that the transfection process worked properly, although that microglia and astrocytes did not respond well to the process in a manner similar to the control cells.
Conclusion:
The process of transfection using jetPEI-Macrophage transfection reagent for microglia cells and jetPRIME for astrocyte cells was unsuccessful. For this reason, we switched to other methods - prior to electrophoresis and when this method was not successful we transferred all our vectors to Lantivirus vectors and we used the Lentivirus infection method.

Future work will be done at fishPHARM to improve the design and manufacturing of fishBIT for mass production. Additional testing will be conducted as we plan to apply for FDA approval of the device. The HMS will be prototyped extensively to develop a more efficient design, and its mobile app will continue to be streamlined.
Components
The fishBIT system combines the simplicity of standard fish tags with the novelty of a synthetic biology treatment.
The plastic harpoon region was designed to ensure that the tag remains in its host under most forces. Its center was hollowed out to allow contact between the host interior and our synthetic biology treatment. Moreover, this plastic is an FDA-approved biocompatible material to minimize risks to the host.
The silicone-based biocompatible tubing houses the treatment gel. It also serves as a marker to determine how much gel has dissolved.
The bright red gel consists of the entericidin protein contained in FDA-approved poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid). This copolymer dissolves readily in most fluids, and its properties can be easily altered. Furthermore, both the protein and the gel are both environmentally safe; the peptide is ubiquitous and the gel degrades easily.
Our tag applicator was designed to be used just like conventional applicators, but with added comfort and easier handling. fishPHARM is currently working on an alternative, more efficient applicator that is inspired by firearm trigger mechanisms.
Each fishBIT starter kits comes with 20 fishBIT tags, a tag applicator, a vial containing our novel flavocide, a needle, a syringe, and an information booklet.
See animations of our components here .
Fabrication & Assembly
The fish tag was 3D printed instead of manually fabricated for increased prototype precision. The Freeform Pico 3D printer from Asiga was used to print the fish tag for its high resolution printing abilities. The fish tag applicator, however, was machined in Cornell's Emerson Lab machine shop out of aluminum. A tube with an inner diameter of 1/16"" and outer diameter of 1/8"" was attached to the back of the fish tag to hold the hydrogel. A syringe was used to insert the hydrogel into the tube, and a clamp was placed at the end to prevent hydrogel escape. The fish tags and applicators, along with the peptide hydrogel, was packaged into a starter kit for distribution to fish farmers.
Testing
We at fishPHARM believe in safety and responsibility for fish"

In addition, the last years iGEM team had started to develop an antibiotics-free selection system and we worked on the improvement of this biosafety system.
Furthermore we are participating in SYNENERGENE. One important task during our participation is the development of possible scenarios for the future of synthetic biology and the development of application senarios. By the way we contacted many experts and talked about possible biosafety issues assocated with our project and future applications.
A proposal of the German iGEM Teams concerning Intellectual Property
During the meetup of the German iGEM teams from 23rd to 25th May also workshops took place in which amongst others we discussed the topic of bioethics. Moral questions were addressed, regarding the value of life and human influence on it, as well as questions dealing with the possible socioeconomic effects of synthetic biology.
Especially the topic of an open source vs. patent controlled field accounted for a large part of the discussion. During the discussion one student brought up the point that the legal status of parts in registry remains unclear and that there are parts (e.g. BBa_K180009 ) where only upon a closer look it becomes clear that the rights are company–owned. The issue that the legal status of parts in the registry remains uncertain is also mentioned in a recent article published by Nature ( Bryn Nelson ‘Synthetic Biology: Cultural Divide ’, Nature 509, 152–154, 08 May 2014 ) :
""[N]o one can say with any certainty how many of these parts are themselves entirely free of patent claims.""
We, the German iGEM teams, therefore like to suggest the addition of a new feature to the parts registry:
A dedicated data field of license information for each BioBrick part.
For the implementation, we propose to introduce two new fields to BioBrick part entries in the registry:
A string property ""LicenseInfo""
A traffic light property (grey, green, yellow, red) to indicate the level of legal protection (unknown, BPA-like, free for research purposes, heavily protected)
Implementing this feature would in our opinion further clarify and extend the parts info, provide a machine-readable format and thus improve future entries. With the emerging Entrepreneurship track and applications getting closer to industrial realization, the legal status becomes more and more important. Also it would raise awareness to the topic of the legal status of parts, leading to a debate which could further promote the idea of open source. At the same time we hope that examination of most parts will show that they are indeed free of restrictive"

Place the Spin Column on the Collection Tube.
Transfer the solution in Step (1) into the Spin Column, then centrifuge it at 12000rpm, under room temperature for 1 minutes and throw away the filtrate. (If the filtrate is added back to the Spin Column to centrifuge again, the recovery rate of the DNA can be improved.)
Add 700μl Buffer WB to the Spin Column then centrifuge it at 12000rpm, under room temperature for 30 seconds and throw away the filtrate. (Make sure that specified volume of 100% ethanol has been added to the Buffer WB.)
Repeat Step (4) once.
Place the Spin Column on the Collection Tube, then centrifuge it at 12000rpm, under room temperature for 1 minutes.
Place the Spin Column on a new 1.5ml centrifuge tube. Add 25-30μl sterile water or Elution Buffer to the center of the membrane of the Spin Column and stand the solution under room temperature for 1 minutes. (If the sterile water or Elution Buffer is heated to 60 degrees Celsius, then the elution efficiency can be improved.)
Centrifuge the solution at 12000rpm, under room temperature for 1 minutes to elute DNA.
7. Gel electrophoresis
1) Prepare agarose gel
Experimental supplies: 1×TAE, agarose
Weigh agarose according to its working concentration. Usually 0.8% or 1% is suitable for running quantitative gel or testing PCR product.
Using 1×TAE to dissolve the agarose by careful warming. (Heat it in microwave oven and boil it two times so that the agarose dissolves completely)
When the temperature decreases to 55 degrees Celsius, add Gelstain and shake it up. (1μl Gelstain per 10 ml gel)
Pour the prepared gel into the electrophoresis bath, wait for the gel to concrete and reserve it.
2) Add sample
For running quantitative gel, add 1μl sample; For testing PCR product, add 3-5μl sample.
Mix up the sample and 10×loading buffer, add the mixture into spotting hole. Be careful not to leave any air bubbles, which will change the volume of the sample.
Add corresponding volume of Marker according to the manual. (Usually 5μl Marker per 10μl spotting hole)
Set up constant voltage 170V, switch on for about 15"

The Ontario Genetically Engineered Machine Network (oGEM)
Queen’s Canada attended the annual oGEM meeting hosted by the McMaster University. We had the pleasure    of being in the company of iGEM teams from the Universities of Toronto, Guelph, Waterloo, Brock,    Ottawa, and Western Ontario. McMaster iGEM Team directed the conversation on the awareness and    challenges faced by the synthetic biology community in Canada. The lack of self and social awareness    in the community was thought to be caused by the fact that synthetic biology is indeed an    interdisciplinary subject and it requires expertise in all branches of science and engineering.    It is quite difficult for such a large multidisciplinary group to recognize themselves, and other    members as one of their own, leading to the absence of communication and combined resources. On top    of that, as a newly emerging field of study, synthetic biology has yet to be clearly defined. The    general public might have the foggiest idea what this community aims to achieve, and misconceptions    about genetic engineering continue to cause fear and resistance in the society. The rest of the    conversation was dedicated to devising solutions to these challenges. Firstly, it is important that    the synthetic biology community finds a suitable definition"

Extensibility
The next phase in collaboration is actually extensibility. This would mean adding new functionalities to BioBrick-A-Bot, by developing new Modules. Currently, we have developed only 2 Modules, called ALPHA and PHI. We planned to build a third Module called MU as described in V2.0 of the specification. Other teams are also encouraged to build and share additional BioBrick-a-Bot Modules as well. In the next version of BioBrick-A-Bot, we will implement Single-Master-Multiple-Slaves Synchronization, to support three or more Modules, with ALPHA as the master.
Collaboration with other iGEM Team
Raik's Barcelona Team
One of our external team advisors, Raik Gruenberg , is interested to start a new team in Barcelona next year and replicate the existing ‘bot’ that we have. This is a good first step. Raik has also written some procedures for performing fusion assemblies . We will attempt to collaborate with his team and get our ‘bot’ to automate the procedure above too.
University of Washington Wet-Lab Team
We have also presented BioBrick-A-Bot to the University of Washington Wet-Lab Team (See Picture Gallery ).  Next year we could look into using one of our ‘bots’ to automate some of the mundane tasks in BioBrick assemblies.
The Vision of Future Collaboration
We built BioBrick-A-Bot V1.0 as a prototype and provide a proof-of-principle demonstration that it worked. V1.0 will however, not have the full range of functionalities of a commercial liquid handling robot. V1.0 will be made up of 2 LegoRoboBrick modules, ALPHA and PHI, mounted on a chassis called BETA. We will provide construction details and software so that other iGEM team can replicate and customize their own 'bot's.
In our next version, BioBrick-A-Bot V2.0, we will provide 3 LegoRoboBrick modules, ALPHA, PHI and MU. We will also support user-defined LegoRoboBrick modules too. We provide the mechanism where other iGEM teams can collaborate together to replicate, interchange and extend LegoRoboBricks. Many iGEM teams can contribute and share both Hardware Construction and Software Programs for LegoRoboBrick modules in a Registry, much like the ""Registry of Standard Biological Parts"". Our vision will be to make the technologies of creating and sharing 'bots' easily available, replacing labour intensive manual work, and cost intensive machines.

- We have defined cell life cycle for the simulated cells and now they divide after specific amount of time.
- We can extract different kind of results such as concentration graphs, and matrices, and rule charts (I will attach a figure of available results).
These components constitute the main framework of the system. Now we need a tutorial that helps biologists to understand this model. As a result, we have designed an animated tutorial which teaches the biological details of the system as well as the notations used to implement this system in Mathematica. One could look at these animations and realize how this model is related to the actual biological cascades of our circuits.
This figure demonstrates a view of this animation.
The biological system goes through two main cascades. Each cascade has its own interactions and agents involved. A nice interface has provided for users to watch the animation of the cascades separately in respect to the interaction occurring. The following figure shows this interface:

Plasmid switch moving LuxPQ from the AK plasmid to the AC plasmid
Purpose: to move LuxPQ (insert) into the AC plasmid (vector) so that we can subsequently move B-R-OU-B into this plasmid. A restriction digest was set up by cutting the insert and vector with XbaI and PstI. After this restriction digest, phosphotase and ligation treatment was performed and the plasmid was subsequently transformed into TOP10 competent cells and plated overnight on LB+Chlor.
In order to construct the PQ-B-R-OU-B circuit, another approach was used in which the LuxPQ in AK is inserted into B-R-OU-B in AC. This was set up by cutting the insert with EcoRI and SpeI and by cutting the recipient with EcoRI and XbaI. Again, after this restriction digest, phosphatase and ligation treatment was performed and the plasmid was subsequently transformed into TOP10 competent cells and plated overnight on LB+Chlor.

I also made up a note card for a gene that was selected for one of the missions in the lab (AFP Gene) as well as note cards to give for each step of construction. Now I am in the process of renaming everything for restriction digest, phosphatase treatment and construction to work using these note cards and creating the substrings"

Background
Rhythmic oscillator remains a hot topic in synthetic biology for a long time. The periodic expression of protein can be realized by the rhythm oscillator, so as to realize the regular expression of non-inductor and the biological timer. The most common oscillator is the Repressilator, a circuit of three proteins encoded by three genes that suppress each other. However, there are some complex problems and many unknown factors in Repressilator. Besides, the stability of the constructed cycle time period is weak, which can cause problems for its further design and engineering utilization.
Twelve years ago, Harvard_2006 had tried to rebuild rhythmic oscillator of Cyanobacteria PCC7942 in E. coli. But the transcription factors that link the Kai clock to gene regulation in Cyanobacteria were not well understood. Therefore they tested their clock in E. coli by measuring the amounts of phosphorylated and unphosphorylated KaiC via western blot. More details can be viewed in the link .
However, some proteins related with Kai have been studied for years, such as SasA, RpaA and CikA. We XMU-China aimed to improve what Harvard did twelve years ago and push the utilization of circadian to a new level.

Introduction
Fusion Receptor
Overview
We hypothesise that expression of receptor protein specific for Vibrio cholerae signalling molecules called autoinducers would confer sensing property on Escherichia coli cell. Because presence of autoinducers in water is associated with cholera pathogens expression of the receptor protein would transform an E.coli into a biosensor. The most straightforward, which does not mean the easiest, way of doing so could be expression of whole signaling pathway in the modified organism. However such an approach leads to a few problems. Firstly, many proteins of downstream signal transduction pathway spanning foreign receptor and DNA have be to introduced into the cell. For example in V.cholera's signalling pathway multiple proteins and small regulatory RNAs are involved. To give response for external stimulus all of them have to be successfully expressed and keep they functionality at satisfactory level. In practice this can be very hard as foreign proteins often tend to form inclusion bodies or their functionality is lowered or lost in a new intracellular conditions they are exposed to. In addition introduction of a whole new pathway can lead to unforeseen consequences for the host cell.
Another method of making bacteria sensitive for external stimulus could be creating fusion receptor protein. In every receptor two elements can be distinguished – receiver and transmitter parts. If two receptors are related closely enough and if they have similar topology fusion of receiver element from one protein with transmitter from the other should give rise to receptor that retains its functionality (Zhu, 2008). Transmitter domain would pass then the signal downstream through a pathway native for modified organism. Such an approach could bring together sensitivity and efficiency of a receptor on one hand  and reliability and good level of understanding of signal transduction pathway native to modified"
Harvard,2011,Team:Harvard#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," a band at the uncut position, indicating that all of the oligos underwent a single or double cut.
The plasmid DNA from the miniprep today was also put through a restriction digest using the same 2 hour protocol as the oligo digest.  The result was then PCR purified, but the yield was extremely low compared to the input.  Using 16 ul of DNA, there were 16 ug of plasmid that went into the restriction digest.  After PCR purification and elution in 30 ul of EB, the yield was only 28.5 ng/ul, meaning only 0.855 ug of DNA in the purified product.  This translate to over 95% of the DNA somehow being lost in the PCR purification.  We are at a complete loss as to why this has happened...
The cut plasmid DNA was run alongside uncut plasmid in a gel, with the results below:
blah
Although the bands are faint, the cut band is somewhere around the correct size (around 2.8 kb).  Although the band appears to be anywhere between 3 kb and 4 kb in the gel, the ladder ran strangely for some reason.  However, there is still a fairly well-defined band instead of a smear in the cut lane.  This in itself is a huge relief - if there were significant genomic DNA contamination, we might expect to get a smear from many differently sized cuts.  Furthermore, the uncut band looks standard for a plasmid, similar to the picture on the website here: [ [20] ].  There are three bands in our gel as they appear on the website.  However, our linearized plasmid is actually fairly close to the bottom band for the uncut plasmid, which is presumably the supercoiled form.

Meeting - Wiki - Rhiannon, Carina and Philipp met to discuss the design and branding of our wiki. We worked mainly on how to represent our project on the homepage. We decided that the homepage should be entry level, and not too focused on the science behind the project. As a result we decided to go for a series of 'infographic' diagrams - each of which answer a different key questions about our project. The default picture will be of our Plastic Republic - the endpoint of our project - and a series of click-through infographics will explain the background of the project and the mechanisms of construction.
Modelling - Aurelija and Joanne continued working on the degradation model and GUI, and Aurelija explored Cell Designer and KAPPA to see how they  might be employed in our project. Outcome: Their MATLAB code works but there are problems with their rate equation, so they are going to continue working on that.
Sponsorship. - The Lonza and Promega packages arrived so the lab crew can proceed with miniprep. We also received eppendorf tubes, gloves, restriction enzymes, DNA ladders.

BPUL activity depending on different ABTS concentrations
Figure 17: Analysis of ABTS oxidation by BPUL laccases incubated in 0.4 CuCl2 tested with different amounts of ABTS. The higher the amount of ABTS the more oxidized ABTS can be detected.
Furthermore, BPUL laccase were tested using different amounts of ABTS to calculate KM and Kcat values. The same measurement setup as described above was used only with different amounts of ABTS. As anticipated, the amount of oxidized ABTS increased in dependence of the amount of ABTS used (Figure 17). Especially using 16 µL showed an increase in the activity until 1 hour (reaching 50 µM ABTSox), but the amount of oxidized ABTS decreased afterward.
Impact of MeOH and acteonitrile on BPUL
For substrate analytic tests the influence of MeOH and acetonitrile on BPUL laccases had to be determined, because substrates have to be dissolved in these reagents. The experiment setup included 0.03 mg mL-1 BPUL laccase, different amounts of MeOH (Figure 18) or acteonitrile (Figure 19), 0.1 mM ABTS and 100 mM sodium actetate buffer to a final volume of 200 µL. The observed reactivity of BPUL in regard of oxidizing ABTS did not reveal a huge decrease. The less MeOH or acetonitrile was used, the higher was the amount of oxidized ABTS after 3 hours. An application of 16 µL MeOH or acetonitrile led to a decrease of maximal 10% oxidized ABTS compared to 2 µL MeOH or acetonitrile. Negative controls are shown in Figure 17 and 18 of the ECOL laccase. MeOH and acetonitril are able to oxidize ABTS. After 5 hours at 25°C ~15 µM ABTS get oxidized through MeOH or acetonitrile, but samples with BPUL laccase show a distinct higher activity of 50 µM ABTSox.

OUR HUMAN PRACTICE
The LIKA-CESAR-BRASIL is participating of iGEM human practices. For this porpose, our first action was to organized The First Workshop in Synthetic Biology and Technology Innovation in Recife. The focus of the workshop was the integration among Robotics, Health, Genetics and Information Technology.
Also for the human practices, the team conducted the campaign against breast cancer in Dona Lindu Park and Boa Viagem Beach. We also enjoying coconut water, sea and a beautiful blue sky. Besides taking advantage of the natural scenery, we spread information about our work and advances in synthetic biology! Working and having fun is our motto! The survey of breast cancer is available at this link for women from 18 years: https://pt.surveymonkey.com/s/prevcamama. The purpose of the questions is whether the women prevent breast cancer by making periodic examinations. The survey will continue to be applied until September and the results will be presented during the competition.
About the experiments we have a special help: Keizo Asami’s Ghost! You may not know him. He gave a great help in negotiations between BRAZIL and Japan in order to build the LIKA. Sadly, he died before the great opening… Well, we believe that he haunts our experiments, in the best way possible of course. Occasionally we hear some weird noises, but we all know that it’s only Keizo wanting to have some fun. Every time that something like that happens, our results get excellent! So, thank you Keizo!

Stanford,2018,Team:Stanford-Brown-RISD#Experiments_-_-_TEXT.html," downstream verification of protein production, and a 6x His tag for protein purification. A challenge incurred when designing these parts was that the His tag maintains some affinity for metals, including copper. This would interfere with downstream modeling and experimental analysis of the interaction between copper and the HHTC domain. We therefore added the Mxe GyrA Intein between the Lumio/His tag and the rest of the protein, as this intein could be cleaved through addition of 50 mM DTT through thiol-mediated cleavage after protein purification [19]. After DTT was added, we were able to obtain the fusion proteins ready for downstream application (as per Figure 2).
Figure 2: Schematic of the design of the fusion proteins (HHTC-Re x n) and the method in which they bind copper.
We also produced an RFP-CBD fusion protein to visualize the distribution of chitin on the surface of a piece of mycelium, as well as a proof of concept for aesthetic design purposes.
2.5 Wet-lab Experiments: Fusion Protein Production
Once all three constructs were ordered (IDT gBlocks), we ligated the linear DNA constructs to the PSB1C3 iGEM backbone using Gibson Assembly, transformed NEB T7 competent E. coli with our new plasmid, and plated the colonies on chloramphenicol selective LB plates. The colonies were incubated at 37℃ overnight or until there were distinct, visible colonies, and never longer than 72 hours. The existence of our DNA constructs in the colonies was confirmed using verification primers (VF2 and VR)  in a colony PCR. We then performed His-tag purification on crude cell extract from our colonies using Thermo Scientific HisPur Ni-NTA spin columns. Following protein purification with the spin columns, we confirmed the presence of our protein in the final elution using Thermo Fisher Scientific’s Lumio Tag Detection Kit [20]. The standard protein purification protocol was modified by introducing a buffer containing 50 mM DTT for on-site cleavage, so the desired fusion protein could be eluted with the His-tag removed. We then performed a BCA Assay to determine our total protein concentration in each elution.
2.6 ITC Testing
Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC; MicroCal iTC200) was employed to determine the association equilibrium constant (Ka), enthalpy (ΔH), and the number of ions bound per ligand (n). Ka describes the affinity of a ligand for its substrate, and we used it to quantit"

-2014
We used  an Acetylene Reduction Assay to examine the nitrogenase activity for JM109, BL21(DE3), Top10, DH5α at different cell density referred by OD600 values.                                  Acetylene (C2H2) has an triple bond similar to that of atmospheric nitrogen (N2). Because of this structural similarity, the nitrogenase enzyme can cleave the triple bond in acetylene just as it would cleave the triple bond in N2. Ethylene (C2H4) is produced from this enzymatic activity, so a gas chromatograph can be used to detect the presence of ethylene and, consequently, nitrogenase activity.
Results
Of the five E. coli strains tested, JM109 and WM1788 showed strongest nitrogenase activity.
The linear relationship between nitrogen fixation activity and time matches that seen in nature.
Optimal conditions determined:
Glucose as carbon-source
glutamate as nitrogen source
LB as inoculating media
minimal M9 as testing media for GC assay
anaerobic enviornment

Phase 4/5 Computationally Modelling an E. Coli system that has Nitrogen Fixation (Penn) and Targeting Nif genes for Overexpression and Silencing (WashU)
-2015
IGEM 2015 Project Description.
While last year’s team was able to take the nif cluster from a cyanobacteria and get it to function in E. coli, nitrogenase activity was minimal.  This year’s team is dedicated to increasing the nitrogenase activity of E. coli with the nif cluster from Cyanothece 51142. The team members at Pennsylvania State will use high level computational modeling to optimize metabolic pathways within E. Coli, which will relieve the strain of nitrogen fixation. The team members at Washington University will create a minimal nif cluster of only those genes necessary for nitrogenase production and activation. In addition, they will silence and overexpress several genes in order to maximize nitrogenase activity.
In doing such, we hope to create a system for nitrogen fixation for transformation into a photosynthetic system. After we come to a greater understanding of how the system works and perfect it, we can move on to working in a more complex organism, such as a cyanobacteria like Synecosystisspp. 6803.
The end goal is to create plants that can fix their own nitrogen by moving from the cyanobacteria into the chloroplast of the plant. End"

With this in mind, these are the aims of our model:
(1) Show a relationship between initial Iron (II) ion concentration and amilCP concentration by means of a graph.
(2) Prove that our construct would or would not work in an in vitro environment in a cell-free system.
If the system does work, we then aim to:
(3a) Find an appropriate FUR concentration for an effective test, while minimising its cost.
(3b) Find an appropriate time to take a measurement.
(3c) Find an appropriate DNA concentration.
Model formation
We used mass action kinetics to model our reactions. This works on the assumption that the rate of reaction is proportional to the concentration of the reactants and products. We first needed to establish what our reactions were. They can be seen below:
<img src=""
"">
(1)Dimerisation of the FUR protein.
<img src=""
"">
(2) Transcription of LacI that is inhibited by the activated FUR.
<img src=""
"">
(3) Translation of LacI protein.
<img src=""
"">
(4) Transcription of amiCP that is inhibited by the LacI protein.
<img src=""
"">
(5) Translation of amilCP protein.
If we let initial FUR concentration be a set value between tests, then more iron leads to more activated FUR, resulting in less LacI production and therefore more amilCP. In short, a lower iron concentration in saliva leads to a less intense blue, while a high iron concentration leads to a more intense blue.
We can break down our model into 9 different reactions to consider separately, then put them together once they are all defined.
For the transcription of LacI and amilCP, the transcription factors (FURactivated and LacI respectively) are not constant. We therefore cannot describe their rates of formation as a constant- we must consider the concentration of the transcription factors (TF). To do this, we use the Hill equation, Where:
<img src=""
"">
--θ is the fraction of transcription factors that are bound to the promoter.
--[TF] is the concentration of the transcription factor.
--Kd is the dissociation constant of the transcription factor to the promoter.
<img src=""
"">
--n is the Hill coefficient. This can be approximated to the number of TFs that binds to one promoter.
