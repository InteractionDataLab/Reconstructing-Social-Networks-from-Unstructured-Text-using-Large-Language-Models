Pre-Engineering Institute BioBuilder Activity
Throughout the Summer, the Washington University in St. Louis School of Engineering and Applied Science hosts a Pre-Engineering Institute for high school students to experience the various disciplines of engineering. The program holds two sessions, and we led a 3.5 hour afternoon workshop on synthetic biology for each of those sessions. During each workshop we presented on the field of synthetic biology and taught them about the central dogma pathway of biology. Following these presentations, we led the students in lab sessions, involving the tuning the expression of Beta-galactosidase in E. coli. Throughout this session, we taught them how to use basic wet lab equipment and answered their questions about the lab, synthetic biology, and college in general.
BioBuilder Professional Development Workshop at Monsanto
On July 20th, we went to Monsanto's Chesterfield campus to speak to local high school teachers and administrators about our involvement in iGEM and what we love about the program. We also presented on our project to give them an example of an iGEM project and synthetic biology research. The high school teachers were interested in starting iGEM teams at their own high schools and wanted to learn more how our team operates."

Waterloo,2016,Team:Waterloo#Integrated Practices#OpenScience_-_-_TEXT.html,"uates from around the world to build and develop these systems from the standard biological parts as well as contribute to the growing database of parts. The official iGEM website explains the competition as:
“Multidisciplinary teams ... [work] to build genetically engineered systems using standard biological parts called Biobricks. iGEM teams work inside and outside the lab, creating sophisticated projects that strive to create a positive contribution to their communities and the world.”(Competition, n.d.).
Inherently in its criteria are expectations for using Registry and Registry-like data.  The creation of standardized assemblies of biological parts called BioBricks encourages open data and open science methods. For this reason, iGEM serves as a case-study of open science in an emerging scientific field, and specifically how the competition interacts with the data practices and larger development of the Registry of Standard Biological Parts, and the acculturation of data sharing practices in synthetic biology.
As previously mentioned, BioBricks are biological parts (or simply “parts”) standardized so that they are interchangeable; each part consist of DNA sequences encoding for a specified function in the cell which may be combined with other parts to create novel systems and applications (Baker et al., 2006).  The development of the concept of BioBricks and their standardization for iGEM is gaining popularity and traction in synthetic biology as the discipline grows  (Purnick & Weiss, 2009).
The BioBricks are also data of much contention, since the developed BioBricks have potential to alter sensitive biological systems and there is minimal international policy around the BioBricks, around which institutions and a developing knowledge infrastructure have formed (Endy, 2005).
The mandate of iGEM is “[dedication] to education and competition, advancement of synthetic biology, and the development of open community and collaboration.” (Competition, n.d.) . This attitude towards openness and collaboration is reinforced within the competition and the other facets of iGEM in a number of ways, including necessitating inter-university collaboration as well as a strict protocol and requirements of submission to the BioBricks registry.  This submission to the registry allows future teams to use previous projects for their work at the competition in future use. This practice of planning and preparing a project that must follow certain criteria is logical for the project as well as teaching the students, as potential future researchers, and the expectations for the submission to the Registry.
An important aspect of this development of open data is collaboration and communication. This is demonstrated in the iGEM gold medal criteria, which requires teams to collaborate. On"

BroadRun-Baltimore,2016,Team:BroadRun-Baltimore#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," that many non-native English speaking iGEM teams face, our team offered to help Heifei’s iGEM team with writing and editing their wiki content, designing the poster and presentation, presenting their project to the judges, and answering questions. Through the summer, we stayed in contact with Heifei iGEM. We gave their team a layout to follow as they worked on writing wiki content (see below), in addition to tips and advice based on our experiences. As they worked on the wiki, we edited and proofread their wiki content to clarify main points and make it easier for readers to understand.
Through September, Heifei iGEM and us further discussed and worked together on their wiki, and began to talk through the poster and presentation. We gave tips and advice on how to plan out the poster and presentation. We sent Heifei a poster template we created, with explanations of how best to layout content in the poster. We also sent a document with explanations of laying out the presentation-Background and Introduction, Objectives, Methods, Results, Conclusions, and Future Work-and what content should be in each section(see below).
In October, we had two Skype calls with Heifei iGEM. In the first, we discussed edits to be made to the wiki content, the design of the poster, and the design of the presentation. We walked their team through the process of laying out the sections of a poster and a presentation, explaining how to organize their content in a way that is concise and clear. Their team practiced parts of their presentation that they had, and we practiced how to answer questions from the judges. In our second call, they continued to practice talking through their presentation. We had created a list of questions for Heifei iGEM that the judges may have for them, and helped them practice answering those questions to be better prepared and to help overcome nervousness.
William and Mary iGEM
Last year, William and Mary iGEM created a synthetic biology teacher curriculum, with a range of hands on activities for kids of all ages, from elementary school to high school. In all four of our extensive public outreach events, we used activities from William and Mary’s curriculum. At all of the events, the activities were extremely popular, kids and adults alike learned a lot, asked great questions, and had fun with the hands on activities.

Virginia_Commonwealth,2009,Team:Virginia Commonwealth#Internal#Papers_-_-_TEXT.html," output and fuel consumption of the engine will be about the same.  Also, if we change another part of the car, such as the steering wheel than the performance of the engine will not be effected.  I think that refinement of devices is a major step for this industry and should be a major part of our goals this summer.  Refinement of these devices will eventually lead to abstraction. - Bussingkm 14:51, 8 June 2009 (UTC)
Refinement refers to taking a natural part and making it compatible with some specific assembly standard.  For instance, in terms of the BioBrick assembly standard, a natural part must have the BioBrick restriction endonuclease sites removed to produce a synthetic part that can be used in BioBrick assembly. - Albergca 15:27, 8 June 2009 (UTC)
To refine a part is to find out more information about it, and organize it in a way that makes it more likely that the part, when used in conjunction with something else, will still have the desired function. It wants to get away from the “ad hoc” method so results can be more predictable. This article suggested datasheets with compatibility information on it. - Trentay 15:01, 8 June 2009 (UTC)
Also, I found the signaling device that they used as an example rather confusing.  Just thought you should know. - Bussingkm 14:56, 8 June 2009 (UTC)
Measuring the activity of BioBrick promoters using an in vivo reference standard
Is the method of measuring/characterizing promoters presented in this paper the method we should use in our work? - GMcArthurIV 11:28, 8 June 2009 (UTC)
This is a clear winner for the method of measuring and characterizing promoters.  This method reduces irregularities due to different lab conditions and tools. An added bonus to using this method is that iGEM has built and distributed a kit for this method which is designed for undergraduate researchers. I think that this method is an excellent step toward standardization of practice in the field.  - Bussingkm 14:38, 8 June 2009 (UTC)
This can be helpful. I do remember the article saying that the promoters that were tested and compared to the reference standard, had to be “standardized” first (p.9 under Standard promoter definition). Would we have to do something like this before we can use the RPU measurement talked about in this paper? Is that what the"
Cambridge,2009,Team:Cambridge#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," boxes is as follows:
The sensor, sensitivity tuner, and colour should be viewed as separate parts that are pieced together to build a tunable biosensor that utilizes colour as output.  The Parts Registry already has an impressive selection of parts that can be used as sensors.  The Cambridge 2009 iGEM team focused on developing a selection of different sensitivity tuner parts and a selection of different pigment producing parts.
Sensitivity Tuner:  These constructs are based on Cambridge 2007's amplifiers.  The general construct is composed of a gene coding for a phage activator protein and a phage activator-sensitive promoter.  With PoPS input, the phage activator gene is transcribed.  After translation to produce the phage activator protein, the protein binds to the phage activator-sensitive promoter to activate transcription.  Thus it is a device that generates a distinct PoPS out given a PoPS in.  With an input-sensitive promoter alone, output generally varies linearly with input--this, at least, is the case with the arabinose-sensitive promoter pBad/Arac (BBa_I0500). However, when a sensitivity tuner is placed downstream of the input-sensitive promoter, the output versus input behavior is altered such that output increases dramatically at a certain input, resulting in sigmoidal behavior with a distinctive threshold.
Colour Generator:  Though E. coli does not naturally produce pigment, several other bacterial species secrete pigmented antibiotics.  We mined bacterial genomes for pigment-producing operons, and transformed the most promising candidates into E. coli.
Kits of Parts
The culmination of our project was to generate and characterize two kits of of parts - one of Sensitivity Tuners and one of Colour Generators.
Sensitivity Tuners: There are 3 different activator genes and 5 different activator-sensitive promoters in the registry. 15 combinations are possible, and each has a distinct threshold and peak rate of output.  The table below summarizes the parts we designed and characterised:
P2 ogr activator
PSP3 pag activator
phiR73 delta activator
PF promoter
PO promoter
PP promoter
Psid promoter
PLL promoter
Colour Generators: We have devoted our summer to 3 different pigment systems:
Carotenoids : The enzymes required for carotenoid production originally come from Pantoea ananatis, and were available in the registry.  We used them to produce orange and red.
Melanin : The tyrosinase required for melanin production originally comes from Rhizobium etli and produces brown.

UNICAMP-Brazil,2009,Team:UNICAMP-Brazil#HP_-_-_TEXT.html," juice and molasses. Several actions have been taken towards this goal, including the development of ethanol engines, mandatory ethanol content in gasoline ranging from 20% to 30%, and, more recently, the adoption of the “flex fuel engine” developed in the U.S.A., which is able to run on pure ethanol, pure gasoline or any mixture of the two. Since 2004, over 80% of all new cars sold in Brazil run on flex fuel engines and currently produced bioethanol is cheap and not subsidized by government. In the U.S.A. bioethanol is produced from cornstarch and thus requires pre-treatment with amylases in order to release the monossacharides from the starch polymer. The need of pre-treatment results in higher production costs when compared to its Brazilian counterpart, thus requiring government subsidies for cheaper sale price.
Biodiesel can also be used as a sole fuel or in blends with fossil diesel. Both can be used in standard diesel engines with no modifications, although some precautions must be taken to avoid filter clogging and the degradation of gaskets and hoses made of natural rubber. Biodiesel use has been increasing in Brazil, The U.S.A. and Europe. In Europe, the Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation obliges suppliers to include 5% renewable fuel in all transport fuel sold in the EU by 2010, which effectively translates into 5% biodiesel used for road diesel.
Nevertheless, first-generation biofuels suffer from some major drawbacks. Firstly, they are less calorific than fossil fuels and are generally more expensive to produce, thus being less efficient than fossil fuels and usually not economically competitive, requiring government subsidies. Secondly, fuels produced from food sources such as corn, sugar beets and soy beans compete directly with food production. It can also be argued that fuels produced from non-food sources also compete with food production at the level of land use. If rural producers find it more lucrative to sell biomass for biofuels than food crops, this would put a strain on food production and push food prices up. In addition, based on current productivity data for biofuels from biomass crops, serious concerns have been placed on the viability of producing enough biofuels to substitute fossil fuels in large scale without seriously compromising available arable land, which could ultimately lead to the further deforestation of our planet.
In view of these problems, biofuels will only bring the desired benefits to our society when they can be produced in substantial quantities, derived from feedstocks produced with much lower life-cycle greenhouse-gas emissions than traditional fossil fuels, be economically competitive with fossil"

Introduction
[Slide: Title]
Hello, we're the Edinburgh iGEM team...
[Slide: What it's all about]
...and this is our project.
Edinburgh's 2011 iGEM project is all about synergy - the ability some enzymes have to work better when close together. In 2010, the Slovenian team found a way to arrange enzymes in the cytoplasm so as to achieve synergy. We wondered whether it would be possible to get extracellular enzymes close together.
Edinburgh's project is also about biorefineries, which are special types of refineries in which biomass, such as cellulose, is converted into useful products. Our project is a feasibility study into the creation of a biorefinery using cellulases arranged in a synergistic manner.
[Slide: Cellulose]
Cellulose is an abundant material, produced by plants, but very hard to break down into useful products.
Modelling
The first question we asked is: what is this synergy phenomenon and how does it work?

Cellulose is a long chain of glucose sugars. It can be broken down by enzymes called ""cellulases"". Consider the following statements about cellulose degradation:
One type of cellulase, exoglucanase, attacks the end of a chain, producing disaccharides called cellobiose.

OSCAR
OSCAR is our Optimized System for Carboxylic Acid Remediation. OSCAR is responsible for converting NAs into hydrocarbons. OSCAR is also capable of removing nitrogen and sulfur groups from NA rings to purify the hydrocarbons produced even further. Click here to learn more!
Decarboxylation
In order to convert NAs into hydrocarbons, we need to remove the carboxylic acid groups that make NAs acids. We are using the PetroBrick, from the University of Washington's 2011 iGEM team, to cleave off carboxylic acids to produce hydrocarbons. Click here to learn more!
Denitrogenation
Nitrogen heteroatoms in the ring structures reduce the efficiency of combustion in the final product. OSCAR is able to remove these nitrogen atoms. Click here to see how!
Desulfurization
OSCAR can remove sulfur atoms trapped in the rings of NAs. Click here to see how!
Catechol Degradation
Catechol is a common toxic compound found in tailings ponds. We looked into giving OSCAR the ability to degrade catechol, which would also cleave ring structures of NAs.
Bioreactor
OSCAR needed a home, so we developed an enclosed bioreactor system where NAs can be converted into hydrocarbons for output. Click here to see how we designed the bioreactor!
Flux-Variability Analysis
We wanted to optimize OSCAR's output of hydrocarbons, so we computationally modelled which genes should be regulated in order to maximize hydrocarbon output. Click here to see what we found out!

Newcastle,2009,Team:Newcastle#Cadmium_-_-_TEXT.html,"ity are confirmed in rat experiments, where infant rats suffer a larger degree of cadmium toxicity than do adult rats. The adult rats would have had more time for their blood-brain barriers to become established in comparison to newborn rats (Wong and Klaassen., 1982).
It has been reported that cadmium can provoke neuronal cells in the brain to undergo oxidative stress – the mechanism behind this is cadmium’s ability to encourage the production of reactive oxygen species when it interacts with the mitochondria (L´opez et al., 2006).
Cadmium can also affect the action of neurotransmitters. In studies, it has been shown to create an increase in concentration of inhibitory neurotransmitters (in particular GABA and Glycine) and create a decrease in the concentrations of excitatory neurotransmitters (in particular glutamate and aspartate) (Minami et al., 2001).

UV Spectrum
Ultraviolet is that part of electromagnetic radiation bounded by the lower wavelength extreme of the visible spectrum and the upper end of the X-ray radiation band. The spectral range of ultraviolet radiation  is,  by definition, between 100  and 400 nm  and  is   invisible   to human  eyes.  The  UV spectrum is subdivided into three bands: UV-A (long-wave) from 315 to 400 nm, UV-B (medium-wave) from 280 to 315 nm, UV-C (short-wave) from 100 to 280 nm. A strong germicidal effect is provided by the radiation in the short-wave UV-C band.
E.coli SOS System
Fig.1
The maximum UV germicidal effect  coincides with the peak absorbance of DNA (near 260nm) due to the dimerization of two adjacent thymines. That can be seen in the Fig.1 where is showed the living population of bacteria after irradiation.  E.Coli cells have a system that recovery DNA damage when it occurs and the best studied transcriptional response to DNA damage is the SOS response [Friedberg et al., 1995; Walker, 1996].
Fig.2
This systems can be divided into two class: the SOS Photoreactivation repair and the  SOS triggered by RecA protein. The first uses the photolyase, a poorly expressed enzyme(encoded by genes phrA and phrB)  which  binds the pyrimidine dimers and uses the blue light to split them apart as showed in Fig.2.
Instead single stranded DNA produced by several DNA-damaging agents can be bound by RecA protein, resulting in conversion of this protein to its activated form. The RecA repair system doesn’t need light and Lexa protein controls the expression of 43 genes [Courcelle et al. (2001)]  that cooperate together to repair the extensive genetic  damage. RecA and LexA proteins play an important rule on the regulatory of SOS Recombination System.  A LexA binding site is"

Did transformations of remaining parts today.  Tried microwaving half of the positive control after heat shock and plating it separately to get another sense of the effect of microwaving on transformation efficiency.  Placed in incubator for 2 hr and 6 min.
Plated almost all parts on 2 plates, with 80% of volume on one and 20% of volume on another.  Ran out of plates, so divided one plate apiece for parts K0001 and L0101 that we believe to already have from another source (i.e. iGEM registry).  In each half of each plate for these parts, we streaked the same difference in volumes (20% AND 80%).  Note that the plates used were those made on 6/18/08 that were suspected of either having too many bubbles or that had the antibiotic poured at too great a temperature.
Put in incubator at around 10:25 pm.  Should check on them again at 12:25 pm tomorrow.

Bielefeld-Germany,2010,Team:Bielefeld-Germany#Safety_-_-_TEXT.html,""" it is quite important to keep unqualified personnel and trespassers away from your laboratory and your samples. In our case we secure our lab with a keypad. Every staff member needs a key to open the laboratory door. Nobody is able to open the door without the proper keys. Staff members receive a key after beeing briefed by the safety officer on safety issues. You can only get a key for the safety stage you are working in. The labs with higher safety stages are cut off from the lower ones. Staff members need a continuative safety guide to receive a key for the higher security levels. Concludingly no unqualified personel can pass the door to the laboratory. Figure 1 shows the keypad in front of the lab.
The laboratories, which are in use for our iGEM project are security stage 1 (S1). For the safety of the staff our labs are equiped with fire extinguishers, emergency showers, eye showers and a heart defibrillator.
Biosafety
Figure 2: We are using a cleanbench to avoid any contamination of our samples. A proper use of the cleanbench can only be achieved by placing all the big things in the rear of the bench, by not disturbing the air circulation and by avoiding any kind of aerosoles. Use gloves for your own protection.
The term ""biological safety"" defines the effort to reduce or eliminate any potential risks caused by biotechnolgy or genetical engineering. The laboratories are scaled into four different saftey stages. The stage ""S1"" defines working with organisms and methods, which do no proved harm - neither to the environment nor to mankind. The stages rise up to biosafety stage four, which defines working with proved humanpathogenous organisms. The WHO defines for the United States the same safety stages, which are called risk groups Manual of Biosecurity, WHO, page 1 .
The Biosafety is ruled by the ""Zentrale Kommission für Biologische Sicherheit"" (ZKBS) in Germany. The ZKBS reviewed and verified all commercial, research or privat laboratories about their safety issues. The iGEM Team Bielefeld is currently working with the organisms Agrobacterium tumefaciens and a derivate of Escherichia coli K12 in a ZKBS reviewed S1-lab. The organism strains are declared as risk factor 1 by the german act of genetics (GenTSV, § 5; 15.06.2010), so:

TU_Delft,2016,Team:TU Delft#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," shapes. Especially spherical lenses are useful since they are symmetrical and therefore do not require a specific orientation; they will focus the light in the same way whatever their orientation is. From figure 2 we can see that the cells are not perfectly homogeneously shaped, there is some variation between the shape of the different cells. This variation is even clearer for the cells that contain the polysilicate layer. This is possibly because two plasmids with a lac promoter put stress on the cells, resulting in a greater variation. For precision optics, it is extremely important that there is little to none variation between the lenses. Therefore, it’s recommended to do more research in controlling cell shape. However, since there is always a variation in gene expression between cells it will be wiser to conduct research into selecting or sorting the cells on their size or shape. A possible solution could be sorting the cells using FACS. As a future experiment, we could stain the polysilicate-coated cells with Rhodamine 123 and let a FACS-machine sort the cells on their phenotype.

Sterilization of the biolenses
Introduction
We wanted to test our biolenses in a real-world application: solar cells. This was chosen, since it was shown to make solar cells more efficient while using microlenses (Jutteau et al., 2015) . Solar panels are currently unable to use all available solar energy, since parts of the light is lost due to non-focused beams. To decrease the losses, light needs to be focused, which can be done by lenses. Jutteau had shown already that solar panels are increased in efficiency while using microlenses. However, these microlenses are chemically produced, meaning under harsh environmental conditions. A high temperature combined with low pressures and harmful chemicals to produce these microlenses do not contribute positively in the total image of “environmentally friendly”.
In our opinion, the eventual product – microlenses – was promising. However, the production method did not add up with the purpose of increasing the potential of solar energy and thereby making general energy use more environmentally friendly. Our biologically produced E. coli cells covered in polysilicate were produced under physiological mild conditions (37 ºC, 1 atm and no harsh chemicals) and would fit much better in the image of environmental friendliness.
To put our cells to the test and see if these are just as promising in increasing the efficiency of solar cells as chemically produced microlenses, we have called for help in the department Photovoltaic Materials and Devices at the TU D"

Group #2 (KO11 with only FucO) obviously gave better results with respect to un-engineered KO11. However, although                 the cell mass of the KO11 group with only FucO was stable in the first 48 hours, it was decreased after the 48th hour. This proves that only the presence                 of the gene FucO in the bacteria wasn’t enough to avoid cell mass decrease in the long term and is in need of another gene for increased tolerance. Also,                 only GSH’s presence isn’t enough since the group of KO11 with only GSH experienced decrease in cell mass. Group #4 (KO11 with both FucO and GSH) gave                 measurement results as we hypothesized by continuing cellular growth in the first 48 hours and maintaining it even after the 48th hour, though at a lower rate.
Second Set (20 mM furfural):

KinA is a major kinase which provides phosphate input to the phosphorelay, which in turn, activates the sporulation pathway upon starvation via the phosphorylated Spo0A transcription factor,[2] which governs entry into the sporulation pathways of the bacterium Bacillus subtilis.[3]
Novelty
Our design has many components which we believe are novel, such as our control over the sporulation cycle, and our synthetic stochastic switch, both systems we believe are reusable concepts within synthetic biology.
Summary of achievements:
Bronze:
We have designed our project together as a team and shared our ideas on the iGEM wiki, as well as registering new standard BioBrick parts on the Registry of Standard Biological Parts. Our BioBricks are novel and easily reusable within synthetic biology. We have submitted DNA for the new BioBrick Parts and Devices which can be viewed here .
Silver:
Our new BioBrick Part BBa_K174011 works as expected and so we have characterised its operation and documented our results on the iGEM wiki and the Registry
Gold:
We have improved the existing BioBrick Part Pspac promoter and documented our new information back on the Registry: BBa_K174004 .We have also helped another iGEM team by sending UQ a mercury sensing model for their project along with a tutorial.

Testing K131026 in our sensor chips
Sensor chips based on K131026 were investigated for fluorescence using a plate reader. Blue color indicates the absence of fluorescence, while red color indicates fluorescence. The lower chip was induced with with 3-oxo-C12-HSL (0.2 µL, 500 µg/mL).
Detecting 3-oxo-C12-HSL with Sensor Chips
In an initial attempt to detect 3-oxo-C12-HSL, we incorporated the K131026 construct generated by the 2008 iGEM Team Calgary in our sensor chips. This construct generates a fluorescent signal based on GFP in presence of 3-oxo-C12-HSL molecules produced by P. aeruginosa during quorum sensing (Jimenez, Koch, Thompson et al., 2012). First, we tested the construct by direct induction with 3-oxo-C12-HSL (0.2 µL, 500 µg/mL). The fluorescence measurement was taken every 15 minutes with an excitation wavelength of 496 nm and an emission wavelength of 516 nm. The results of this test are shown on the right.
A distinct fluorescence signal was observed on the induced chip (bottom) compared to the non-induced chip (top).  Fluorescence started in the middle of the chip, the point of induction, and then extended outwards while growing in intesnity. The basal level of fluorescence was attributed to leakiness of the promoter and general background fluorescence of growing E. coli cells. In the induced chip (bottom), the background fluorescence was lower than in the non-induced chip (top) because the signal masked the noise. The difference between the induced and non-induced chips indicates a clear response to the HSL and proofed the ability of our 2D sensor chip design to detect HSLs produced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

It can be concluded that the reaction can be stopped in certain stage of the reaction, because it                         is uneconomical to continue the reaction. At the same time, for the initial antigen                         concentration change, the initial large reaction starts to be fast, while the initial value is                         small, the reaction rate starts to be small; at the same time, the optimum reaction time for the                         different concentrations of the added antigen is about the same, and has little relationship                         with the concentration. Finally, there is a clear relationship between the fixed time of the                         antigen and the gray value.
Adding antigen concentration and adding antibody concentration ratio relationship
In order to the final result was as expected by making the solubility of the configured                         antigen-antibody immobilization solution. It is necessary to optimize the concentration                         ratio for them.

Detection of Wheat Scab Based On
Feature Engineering and Machine Learning
In this study, we proposed a method to automatically detect whether there is any scab in wheat. It is based on feature engineering and machine learning.
The method includes two parts. In part one, we process the image to extract some features. In part two, we use the features which are selected in part one to train a machine learning model. Finally, the model will be used to detect Wheat Scab. Please refer to the information offered below for details.
Workflow of our method
We first compress the image and filter the color image. And the image is binarized to separate a single wheat image. The original image and the segmented image are multiplied so as to obtain the wheat color image, from which features are extracted. In this way, we process more than 110 images and extract more than 45 features from each image.
The first, second and third order matrix of each color channel        are extracted in         five color spaces of RGB, HSB, HSI, YCBCR and LAB respectively. The features, which we extracted above, consist in them.         Then our problem is turned into binary classification, which belongs to machine learning. We use SVM (Support Vector Machine), Decision Tree, Random         Forest and so on to train our model. In machine learning, all of them are supervised learning models related to the relevant learning algorithm. Taking our         sample space into account, as well as good performance of SVM in small samples, we finally choose SVM as our supervised learning model.         Our sample space is defined as follows. In this definition, Xin represents ‘the n-th        feature of the i-th sample’, and Yi represents ‘the label of the i-th sample ’.
The data set  S  is divided into train set  Strain   and test set    Stest  , the data"

When testing the validity of the secretory tag YebF, we transformed the constructed YebF-GFP plasmid into DH5α and cultured overnight at 37 ℃. The supernatant was centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 5 min, and the supernatant was taken for fluorescence detection. The results are shown in the Figure 6. But we forgot to set up a positive control group. Due to time constraints, we have no time to repeat this experiment. But as a secretory tag used in both the literature and the iGEM team, we believe it can actually work.
We transformed the IL10-flag plasmid into BL21, and incubated at 37 ℃ overnight to dilute to OD = 0.2. After 2 h of growth at 37 ℃, IPTG was added and induced at 30 ℃ for 16 h. Then, the bacterial solution was lysed and the expression of IL10 was detected by western blot (Figure 7). We used the human IL10 sequence optimized by E. coli from the previous iGEM team (the original part is BBa_K554004 ). So we have reason to believe that we have successfully expressed IL10. As a widely validated and used cytokine, we believe it can play an immunosuppressive role in vivo.

We transformed the plasmid of myrosinase-his into BL21, and cultured at 37 ℃ overnight and diluted to OD = 0.2. After growth for 2 h at 37 ℃, different concentrations of IPTG were added and induced at 16 ℃ for 16 h. The bacterial cell lysis was then performed to detect the expression of myrosinase by SDS-PAGE (Figure 8). The sequence of the myrosinase enzyme was optimized based on the K12 strain and the position of the strip is almost correct, so we believe we have successfully expressed it. The myrosinase can convert glucosinolates contained in cruciferous vegetables into sulforaphane which has well-known anti-cancer activity. A literature earlier this year (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41551-017-0181-y) has validated the activity of myros"

In August 26th, with the invitation from Fujian Agriculture and Forest University, we attended 2017 Conference of China iGEMer Community(CCiC) in Fuzhou, Fujian Province. Zihao Wang and Xiaolin Dong did the presentation. Huadong Xing designed the poster, Jin Liu and Zhongqiao Gan introduced the posters to others. Hongmin Yu was in charge of the conference recording. During the conference, many famous synthetic biologists, such as Prof. Chunbo Lou from Chinese Academy of Science, Prof. Luping Xu from Tsinghua University, Dr. Haoqian Zhang and Dr. Teng Li from Bluepha, etc., did their lectures. A face-to-face discussion with iGEM HQ was also held.
In this conference, we communicated with other teams about the design of the projects and problems we met during the experiments. We learned a lot from other teams and established good relationship with them. Our good performance was approved by professors attending the conference, and we received many suggestions from them.

INDUSTRIAL APPLICATIONS
The main industrial application of our talking yeast is to know the moment at which fermentation started. This is possible because we can calculate the time elapsed since the medium ran out of glucose according to the fluorescence intensity. Taking this into account, we could ask the yeast, through the addition of hydrogen peroxide: “How long have you been fermenting?” And the cells would answer telling us how long it has been since all the glucose was consumed. One possible answer could be “I have been fermenting for 1 hour”.
There is also a second possible application, but it needs a more detailed explanation:
There are several factors affecting yeast ethanol production during alcoholic fermentation. Saccharomyces cerevisiae seems to have adapted all along its evolution to optimize its growing rate in environments that are rich in easily assimilable nutrients, such as sugars and amino acids.
There are two important characteristics responsible of S. cerevisiae adaptation to this particular niche. One of them is its capability of metabolizing glucose and fructose through both the respiration and the fermentation pathways. The second one is its ability to grow in aerobic and anaerobic conditions. All of this makes this species exhibit some metabolic peculiarities, such as the Pasteur and the Crabtree effects. The Crabtree effect, described in S. cerevisiae and in a few other yeast species, must be taken into account when ethanol production is being studied or modified during fermentation. This effect causes that, even under high concentration of oxygen and with a relatively low amount of glucose, a considerable fraction of the consumed sugar is used to produce ethanol through the fermentative pathway. This is why in every industrial process which requires yeast growth (such as starter yeast production) it is necessary to provide the optimum amount of glucose that permits its direct consumption through the respiratory pathway (or the other way round if fermentation is desirable, such in bioethanol production).
We present here one way of monitoring the fate of glucose in the medium. By adding a small amount of hydrogen peroxide as a chemical input, we plan to ask our culture: “Is there any glucose left?”, and the culture would answer -according to the amount of glucose already present in the medium- what concentration would be necessary to optimize either yeast growth or fermentation through the Crabtree effect. In this way, the Crabtree effect could be monitored (perhaps even"

VIII Fluid and Solid model
    Because of our limited time, we have not constructed all characters and used it to investigate some interesting questions, but our model can help us study the behaviors of this system.
     Concretely, we designed a fluid model and a solid model, where the solid model has taken spatial effects on relationships between populations and individuals into consideration. In the fluid model, we use Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) to describe the behavior of the amount of different characters and molecules. In the solid model, however, we use Cellular Automaton (CA) to mimic effects of spatial factors. (See more at Fluid Model and Solid Model )
     As is shown above, fluid model helped us a lot on experimental design. Besides, they can also be used to help us design our game---E.coli War! The game can be used to help us consider effects of some factors on population interactions. Besides, it can even help us realize the educational purpose of our project and make the public know more about synthetic biology!
IX E.coli War
     Our games are made on structure of html5.The videos below are two short videos of our Fluid E.coli War and Solid E.coli War.
     See more details on Fluid E.coli War and Solid E.coli War
     After we designed our game preliminarily, we visited Beijing Perfect World Network Technology Co., Ltd (Perfect World), one of the largest game company in China, to learn more about the design of a game. The useful advice from the experts help us a lot in improving our E.coli War, making it more fun and easier for kids to play.
    See more details at Visiting Perfect World
    Afterwards, when children played this game during our exhibition in China Science and Technology Museum (CSTM), they found many interesting results which can even promote our understanding of this system. (Fig.10) (See more details at Exhibition at National Museum and Game Discovery ) Furthermore, this can also be helpful for our further research design.

X Summary
     In conclusion, we designed a very general system to study many complex relationships and also a useful model to describe this system. In the future, it will be convenient to investigate some interesting questions with regard to relationships between populations and individuals by using this system.
     What’s more, we designed two interesting games--- Fluid E.coli War and Solid E.coli War to make the public more interested in synthetic biology. Conversely, their finding of many interesting results and disciplines in the games"

ACEA Construct
Backbone
For ACEA construct, we decided to use a commercial plasmid called pShooter/myc/mito (Invitrogen). The vector is designed for expression in mammalian cell. In addition, the vector already contains mitochondrial leader sequence (MLS), a constitutive CMV promoter, Myc tag protein and polyadenylation site.
Constitutive Promoter
In order for the prokaryotic genes to be expressed in mammalian cell, we need to fuse them with eukaryotic promoter. In order to generate the same result as UCLA team’s experiment, we adhere to their choice of promoter by fusing aceA gene with CMV promoter. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter is a commonly used constitutive promoter to drive protein expression in mammalian cell.
Assembly
ACEA construct is assembled by extracting out aceA gene from E. coli BW25113 genome. The ligation product was confirmed by digestion check and sequencing.
ACEB Construct
Backbone pSB1C3 was used for ACEB construct.
Constitutive Promoter
In line with the UCLA’s experiment, we will fuse aceB gene with human elongation factor-1 alpha (EF-1alpha) promoter. EF-1alpha promoter is often useful in conditions where other promoters (such as CMV promoter) have diminished activity or have been silenced. We cloned EF-1alpha promoter from plasmid called iDUET101a (Addgene).
Tag protein
We engineered in a FLAG protein tag in the 3’ ends of AceB by including the sequence in aceB extraction primer.
3’ primer to extract aceB with engineered FLAG tag gene sequence:
GATCAT CTCGAG CTTATCGTCGTCATCCTTGTAATC CGCTAACAGGCGGTAG
[6’ Cap][6’ XhoI restriction site][24’ FLAG protein][25' reverse complementary of 3’ aceB]
Mitochondrial Leader Sequence
Since pSB1C3 backbone does not have any MLS and aceB needs to be translocated to mitochondria to serve glyoxylate shunt, we extract MLS out from pShooter/myc/mito (Invitrogen).

Soft-lithography
Fabricated microfluidic devices (three PDMS molds bonded to single glass slide)
Microfluidic channels were formed using PDMS soft-lithography technology, which has proven biocompatible and readily applicable to available laminar flow cabinets [Fikar2015] . Photomask and silicon master fabrication was outsourced. Fabrication of microfluidic devices was divided into two subsequent steps. In the first step, silicon masters were used for the PDMS molding. In the second step, PDMS molds were bonded to the glass substrates to form encapsulated microfluidic devices using air plasma technology.
PDMS molding
PDMS molding workflow
Two-part silicone elastomer Sylgard 184 was used to produce PDMS. The base part was mixed with sufficient amount of curing agent (10:1 ratio). The mixture was centrifuged to remove air bubbles introduced by the mixing. The silicon master was placed in an aluminum foil container and the mixture was poured over. The remaining air bubbles were removed from the PDMS by the sharp tip of a needle. The poured PDMS was maintained in a perfectly horizontal position to assure good planarity and was cured in an oven for 2 hours at 80°C. The PDMS edges were cut off with a sharp tool and the PDMS was peeled off of the silicon master. The PDMS mold was sliced into sections containing individual devices. Inlets and outlets were drilled carefully by biopsy punch of the appropriate diameter at the desired locations of the PDMS replica. Detailed experimental protocol is provided here .
Bonding of PDMS to the glass substrate
Bonding process workflow
Prepared PDMS replicas with imprinted microstructures were cleaned properly with a scotch tape. The PDMS and glass substrate were treated by air plasma for 2.5 minutes. The air plasma affects the PDMS backbone and forms reactive silanol functional groups (Si-OH) enabling formation of permanent irreversible covalent bond of the PDMS to the glass substrate [Wong2009] . In addition, the PDMS treatment with air plasma is beneficial as it avoids non-specific adsorption, decreases cell clogging, and turns the PDMS hydrophilic. The hydrophilicity of PDMS facilitates the future microchannel wetting [Kalio2006] . Immediately after the air plasma treatment, the glass substrate was brought into contact with the PDMS replica and placed in the oven for 5 minutes at 80°C. The bonded devices were stored at room temperature. Inlets and outlets were sealed with scotch tape to avoid contamination. Detailed experimental protocol"

John: “Yeah, I know. It’s been 500 years since the dark ages… It is so weird to think about     how we used to live.”
Sofus: “It’s weird to think of them as our ancestors. We have evolved since, I believe.”
John: “That we have, yes. I actually read something about their ideas of creating new life.”
Sofus: “Why would you want to read something from the dark ages?”
John: “I was drunk and did some research on how the perfect new life form should look. I stumbled on something called ‘Google’ that they used.”
Sofus: “I think I have heard of that – they had that on ‘the Internet’, right?”
John: “Yes. But, there was actually a lot of articles about life."

PCR of GFP and mCherry
Miniprep of overnight BB part cultures:
GFP concentration: 39.7 ng/uL, 260/280: 2.02, 260/230: 1.44
mCherry concentration: 38 ng/uL, 260/280: 1.9, 260/230: 1.01
Procedure:
2.5 uL 10X PCR buffer
0.5 uL 10 mM DNTPs
0.5 uL of forward primer at 10 mM
0.5 uL of reverse primer at 10 mM
0.5 uL template (Shu's miniprep GFP and mCherry products)
0.25 Taq polymerase
20.25 uL H20
PCR settings:
Denature: 95 C, 7 s.
Anneal: 51 C, 43 s.
Elongate 72 C, 2 m.
Made 400 mL 1% agarose with Shu
Poured 2 gels
Ran a gel of the PCR products
GFP3 and 4 did not have bands in the correct place, so we reran PCR on them and on GFP 2, which had a lower concentration and 260/230 ratio than the rest
We plan to troubleshoot by changing the voltage we’re running at and using newly diluted TAE

Bielefeld-Germany,2013,Team:Bielefeld-Germany#Human Practice#Experts_-_-_TEXT.html," with bacteria ever discussed within your company?
No, we tend to research and evaluate techniques, which are standing just before a broad market acceptance.
We think of the MFC as a device that can supply small and medium sized energy-dependant equipment. Is there a market for this kind of renewable direct energy supply?
This might prove to be problematic, from which I can say. Even very homogeneous substances (e.g. hydrogen/methane) could not succeed in this dimension.
How efficient are modern methods for energy storage and how much energy is lost during the charging and discharging process (a problem that could be avoided by using an MFC)?
The efficiency of a pumped-storage power station lies around 80%. For lithium-ion accumulators this value is similar, nevertheless the li-ion technology is much more expensive.
Impacts on our project
For us, it is an encouraging sign that an expert like Mr. Wanner, who has insite in practically every field considering renewable energies, has a positive opinion of our ideas. What becomes obvious, is that we really have to try to develop a system that is free of any inconveniences. The biodegradable MFC is a step towards this goal but consecutive improvements have to be made. What helps our intentions, is the entry of seminal devices like 3D-printers in the everyday life of millions of people. This gives us the opportunity to produce an MFC at very low costs, compared to heavy-metal batteries and especially lithium-ion batteries, which are furthermore dependable on declining resources.
Although the market for MFCs is still minor, this does not mean it cannot grow in the next decades. One might consider the use of MFCs as a bioremediation and energy producing tool in wastewater treatment. A development from this purely industrial usage towards our preferred area of application, as a strong counterpart to normal batteries used in households, could be achieved.
The advantages are clear: No toxic wastes and most important no significant loss of energy due to storage conditions. Lithium-ion batteries and pumped-storage power stations can nowadays only achieve an efficiency of 80%. Great efforts are made to raise these values, but a 100% efficiency can never be reached. For MFC´s alike, we definitely have to take this into account. Until MFC´s reach a higher efficiency than batteries there is still a lot of research to do. Nevertheless, it is clear to us, that the possibilities offered by microbial fuel cells are enormous and should be explored thoroughly.

Collaboration
Our goals cannot be achieved alone, that is a fact - it is too grand a mission to go on alone. This is one of the central values of iGEM itself, and so no less than X international collaborating teams would do:
Collaborating Teams
Leiden
XMU China
Imperial College
DTU-Denmark
SDU-Denmark
Munich United
Gothenburg-Chalmers
A more detailed of what each collaboration meant for us can be found here.
Friendship Teams
ITU Turkey
Stockholm
NiC Participants
European Meet-Up Participants (including Randy)
Beyond the tangible lab-cooperation of the above, we have enjoyed many friendships with other teams - discussing our ideas, meeting at international meet-ups and spending hours upon hours on Skype co-developing our ideas.
Commercial and Ideological Aspects
Our large-scale ambition is to substantiate and help facilitate space exploration and colonization. Towards this end it was necessary to seriously consider practical circumstances and their influence on the makings of our project.
Our first step was to investigate the legislation concerning intellectual property, and the next to consider the modularity and its application. All such endeavours are described. Lastly, we addressed the extremely necessary matter of ideological and ethical facets of space exploration. All of it can be seen here .

Harvard,2009,Team:Harvard#Daily_-_-_TEXT.html," cultures of IPTG uinduced bacteria were spun down and resuspended in 5 mL ea. Sodium citrate buffer with 1 mmol luciferin. An addition 40 UL of 100 mMol luciferin was spiked in and seen to result in an increased luminescent signal by eye. 4 mL of bacteria were placed in the holding chamber for both PCB treated yeast and DMSO treated yeast. Two additional negative controls were also done, PCB treated yeast and DMSO treated yeast without bacteria. 50 ul of 100 mmol luciferin was spiked in at 1 hour, 2 hours, and 3 hours. Large mirrors were placed below the plates and small above, and the whole shebang wrapped in foil and placed on a shaking incubator at 30 degrees. By eye it was difficult to see luminescence at 1 or 2 hours, even though initial luminescence was extremely bright. Luminescence at 1 hour was clearer with coculture.  The result of this experiment was negative. There was no visible blue on any of the plates, more or less. This experiment will need to be repeated.  This is an image of the bacteria-yeast communication apparatus we designed so that the bacteria would not have to sit right on the yeast plate and therefore kill everything under it. There is one main hole for aeration and allowing us to spike in luciferase, and a smaller vent hole.

In our iGEM work we have only worked with non-toxic E. coli (K12 derivatives) and all the protein coding sequences that we have used in our project are non-hazardous. We did not create new protein coding sequences but instead we used sequences that are already available as Biobricks.
Our Laboratory
We got to work in the Bioprocess Technology lab of Aalto University. We had our own lab bench and we got to use all the instruments and equipment in the department. We also did some measurements in the labs of the VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland.

Lab Close-Ups
Our Office
We also needed a proper office space where we could work during the summer since not everyone was going to do lab work and our lab bench wasn’t that spacious either.
We managed to find the ""Learning Hub Living Room"" (Vuori Hub) in the building of Department of Materials Science and Engineering. Since it was summer, there weren't many people around to use the space and we made it our home. It was a comfortable place to work in!

Thorough Documentation
Being the first team in Finland, we wanted to make sure that we documented everything we did as rigorously as possible.
We have our lab notebook in PDF files. From these you will be able to find everything that was done in the lab on a specific date.

What will you do today?
What might stop you from doing what you want to do?
Each of us wrote the answers down on our online team chat tool (Flowdock). According to the answers, we then assembled a detailed description of every single working day during our official work months (from May 20th to the end of August). So if you really really want to read exactly what we did, here's 30 pages of text for you to check out:

Background
In our project we developed a system to fight pathogens in the gut, which is not a unique idea. Except we wanted our systems key attribute to be specificity. To do so, we needed to find a unique quorum sensing language that we could hijack and utilize. We found the Yen system, from Yersinia enterocolitica. A homologous sytem to the well known Lux system, from Vibrio fischeri.
System design
From the Yen system we stole the activator YenR and the recognition region, the yenbox, fused with a wild type promoter. YenR was synthesized with the RBS B0034 and codon optimized for E. coli. A customized version of the yenbox-promoter was also created.
Result
We managed to get a five-fold induction relative to the base level of expression. The cells that were used during the measurements were double transformed with the yenbox-promoter complex with GFP and a plasmid producing the activator YenR.

Fig. 12 shows the multiple sequence alignment of the seven synthetic T-domains and the native indC T-domain. After the generation of the T-domain amino acid sequences, the OPTIMIZER web-tool( http://genomes.urv.es/OPTIMIZER/ ) was used to obtain the corresponding DNA sequence [16]. E. coli K-12 was set as strain for codon optimization and most frequent was chosen as codon option. The generated DNA sequence was cured from internal RFC10 cutting sites and CPEC cloning overhang required for the T-domain swapping into the ccdb construct were introduced. The synthetic T-domains were ordered at IDT (Integrated DNA Technologies, Coralville, Iowa). In order to obtain sufficient amounts of DNA, the synthetic T-domains were amplified via PCR. IndC-hybrid constructs of the native IndC with exchange of the native T-domain by the synthetic variants were assembled using CPEC and the indC-ccdB construct as backbone. The synthetic T-domains were amplified for CPEC using the same primers as for the native indC T-domain.
Figure 12: Multiple Sequence Alignment of seven synthetic T-domains generated by consensus and guided random methods. The multiple sequence alignment (MSA) was generated using clustalo (
P. luminescens, whereas the following line refer to the seven synthetic T-domains created by the Consensus method (synT1 to synT4), the Guided random method (synT5 and synT6) and the Randomized generation method (synT7). When inserted into the indC indigoidine synthetase - thus replacing the native T-domain - four of the synthetic T-domains resulted in a functional enzyme producing the blue pigment indigoidine, namely synT1, synT3, synT4 and synT5. Notably, the engineered indC variants containing the T-domains synT1, synT3 and synT4 showed to be more efficient in the production of indigoidine than the wild-type indC (see Fig. 10).

XMU-China,2013,Team:XMU-China#Content6_-_-_TEXT.html," the answer then he would win a prize. Foldit, a computer game loved by the high school students since they can learn from entertainment, folds proteins and tests their stabilities with four people competing in it. Finding the differences between DNA molecules, is to find two or three differences between two analogous DNA pictures. From this game participants could be aware of DNA structure more deeply and practice their precision. We accumulated every students’ points and the final top 10 won the prize.
Our special prize is the cards——Bio Bang, which was inspired by War Within Three Kingdoms, which are very popular in China. And only those who were top 10 on the scoring list could get one deck. Some high school students even play the cards with our plain guidance, making us think it’s an interesting and enjoyable game. Participants hoped that we could send  them more cards and give them designing pictures. From this game we had a better interaction. More details are in the next section.
Finally, our team organized a special interaction for these high school students. We show them our culture strains so that they can get close to real germiculture out of lab. Of course we’ve paid much attention on biosafety and no potential damage to the environment or public occurred.
After the campus fair games as well as the exhibition, these senior high school students signed on our whiteboard and had a group photo taken with us at our request. We made informal interviews with some of them and get a satisfactory feedback. They wished we could hold the activities next year and they would try their best to popularize synthetic biology and iGEM. A student, from Shaowu No.1 Middle School of Fujian, expressed his hope that we could come to their hometown to help people in the countryside to get a correct understanding of genetic engineering. As I know, some people even regard transgenosis as poisons. This is also our hope that more and more people can learn something about transgenic products via this competition and have a better understanding of genetic engineering. After all, we, as iGEMers, should not only do experiments in laboratory, but also help synthetic biology understood by the public.
BioBang
It’s a great honor for me to introduce our attractive “byproduct”——Bio Bang. We designed these special card for these high school students who were the top ten on our scoring list. These sets of cards——we called them Bio Bang——were inspired by War Within Three Kingdoms, which are very popular in China，just like Bang！ in America. It consists of abundant role-relationship and mutual promotion and restraint between every cards. The"

Purpose of collaboration:
Bring the topic of Synthetic Biology close to the public
Description:
Previous iGEM teams from the Heinrich-Heine university of Düsseldorf created a tradition of bringing Synthetic Biology to the public eye by sharing themed postcards.
Every year, many iGEM teams join this campaign.
This year, we designed a postcard and sent it to the Düsseldorf team for distribution.
We were inspired by this project and printed extra copies of our postcard that are posted in our human practice events.

Initial Concentrations
Results
There was a significant amount of output from the model as we had a considerable volume of parameters to compare against. 5 subplots were created from the model, which were in reference to the time evolution of the concentrations of intracellular arabinose, arabinose-AraC complex, AraC protein, mRNA coding and protegrin-1 respectively. For the production of the protegrin-1, mainly encased in equation (1.5), the parameters are unknown so there was a great deal of variation in the final graph produced in the output. Below are two selected outputs from the model which depict the different behaviour and the possible instability of the protegrin-1 production.
Figure 3: The MATLAB output from the stated initial conditions (where the y-axis is molar concentration (M) for the respective compounds or complexes for each respective equation (1.1)-(1.5) and the x-axis is time (seconds)).
Figure 4: The MATLAB output from the stated initial conditions (where the y-axis is molar concentration (M) for the respective compounds or complexes for each respective equation (1.1)-(1.5) and the x-axis is time (seconds)).
These two sets of graphs use a similar set of initial conditions chosen from the ranges given above. The initial conditions that actually created each series are labelled above each respective graph array. However it can be seen that the Figure 3 has a complication when it comes to the concentration of the protegrin-1 concentration graph (the last in each of the series). These graphs depict the instability that forms because of the initial conditions. The method employed in creating the equations allows the protegrin-1 to remain positive if it starts positive. However, after the initial time lag the protegrin-1 concentration must become negative and therefore induce the instability that is shown. Also the oscillatory and almost severe peaks and troughs formed on the graph were assumed to have been contributed from the time step utilised in the odesolver inbuilt in MATLAB. The time step in MATLAB attempts to optimise the data that it collects which can also affect the output.
Figure 4 shows a much smoother inclination, and positive, for the protegrin-1 concentration and, at the end of the iterations, appears to be approaching"

Furthermore, these results demonstrate that this novel protein can be used to perform targeted next generation sequencing. We were able to identify 89 sequencing events that align to our target DNA (EPO linear plasmid DNA). We were even able to identify the exact position of adapter integration by our fusion protein based on one single DNA read out of over 200 000 reads (including reads from the internal control). This demonstrates that targeted sequencing with library preparation by our fusion protein significantly simplifies data analysis and could be used to detect gene doping DNA.

We are of course aware of the statistical study from the 2013 iGEM Paris-Bettencourt team showing that parity inside a team positively influences its success. Against this statistic and for modestly contribute to the fight for men-women parity, we would like to demonstrate that only complementary skills are the secret ingredient to the success in this competition, beyond the gender.
ETHICS
ETHICS
At the heart of the synthetic biology iGEM competition is the modification of microorganisms and therefore the creation of genetically modified microorganisms (GMM), a sub-category of the genetically modified organisms (OGM) that also include higher organisms such as animals and plants. Although the issues raised by OGM in the public mainly concern plants (GMP) and more recently also animals (GMA) including Human because of the ease of manipulate organisms with the powerful CRISPR-Cas9 tools, we need to think about the ethics of our iGEM project and share our thinking with the public.
From left to right: GMA, GMP and GMM
To fuel our thinking, beside reading few publications, we were lucky enough to be able to regularly discuss with Dr Vincent Grégoire-Delory, Head of the “Ecole Supérieure d’Ethique des Sciences” in Toulouse. We have also participated to a workshop on Genetically Modified Microorganism organized by the “Plateforme Génétique & Société” whose guest stars were Pr Bernadette Bensaude-Vincent from Paris, members of ethics committees and Pr. Thierry Magnin from Lyon, Head of the « groupe d’épistémologie et d’éthique des sciences et technologies ». We have also attended a seminar on genome editing given by the Pr. Père Puigdomenech from Barcelona, member of European ethics committees, co-organized by the “Académie des Sciences, Inscriptions et Belles Lettres” of Toulouse. While participating to an exhibition on genetics at the “Museum d’Histoire Naturelle” in Toulouse, we also have had the opportunity to discuss with Dr Anne Cambon-Thomsen, Head of the “Plateforme Génétique & Société” of Toulouse and member of European ethics committees.
From all these readings and discussions, we realized that as far as ethics issues are concerned, there are two main point of views, anthropocentrism vs biocentrism, that would deeply impact on the outcome of any debate.

SDU-Denmark,2013,Team:SDU-Denmark#Tour63_-_-_TEXT.html," gene from B. subtilis and the prenyltransferase catalyses the formation of a cytotoxic substance. Furthermore, the transcription and translation of plasmids wastes energy that could be spent on growing and dividing, particularly in an antibiotic-free environment. Hence, plasmid loss seems likely if our modified bacteria were introduced into nature.
Ethical dilemmas concerning out-competing the established industry can be raised. Poverty is already widespread amongst third world manual laborers, who risk to lose additional jobs, if agricultural industry is converted to hi-tech. However, environmental solutions might arguably outweigh economical concerns. This is certainly true, if the rubber farmers are presented with an alternate usage for their land, and with the growing demand for rubber, conventional methods of extraction might be necessary for years after implementation of Bacteriorganic Rubber.
The bacteria need an energy source, if they are to produce rubber. In the lab this energy source is the LB media, which is made from casein (from milk). Industrial usage of human food is heavily criticized, as exemplified by the debate on biofuel from corn. A solution could be to transfer the system to cyanobacteria that grow on carbon dioxide and sunlight. A positive externality of this solution is the consumption of carbon dioxide, a major greenhouse gas .

Collaboration
""Creating a better world requires team work, partnership and collaboration, as we need an entire army of companies to work together to build a better world within the most few decades. This means corporations must embrace the benefits of cooperating with one another""
As the statement suggest, iGEM allows every team to join hands with other teams to benefit each other. Apparently our team had united with the following teams:
Aachen is a research university of technology located in Germany. Our team had collaborated with them through a formal meetup with one of their team members and also by filling their ""TUBEFRONT"" survey which is based on Safety Organisation.
Uppsala university is the research university in Uppsala, Sweden.One member of the Uppsala team did her undergraduate from  our college and when she came to vacation here she came to know that we are participating in iGEM and this is our first endeavor in iGEM. She met us and discussed about iGEM and shared her thoughts with us. We decided to collaborate and once she returned to Sweden we were in regular contact through Skype meetings and email conversation and they gave their suggestions regarding our project. We filled their team survey forms for policy and practices and we gave them our survey forms for doctors to get the expert opinion.
Bettencourt team claimed us to fill their ""FOOD SURVEY"" form required for their survey which led to their collaboration with us.

KinA Expression Model
Under normal conditions, LacI represses KinA.
However, in the presence of IPTG, KinA can be expressed, as IPTG binds to LacI, deactivating it. Equations (a) and (b) describes how IPTG binds to LacI, forming LacI*, which is the deactivated form of LacI
Over time, the deactivated form of LacI, LacI* may degrade. This is also taken into consideration while building the model.
Protein synthesis requires two steps, transcription and translation, and is further illustrated in Figure 1, below.
Figure 1: Transcription and Translation
Referring to Figure 1, the following equations can be written:
Transcription of LacI,
Translation of LacI,
where mRNA_LacI is inducing the formation of LacI.
Transcription of KinA,
where LacI is repressing mRNA_KinA, therefore a lower concentration of LacI would result in a higher concentration of mRNA_KinA.
Translation of KinA,
where mRNA_KinA is inducing the formation of KinA.
As parameters such as transcription and translation rates could not be found in literature, the following equations were used to calculate the transcription and translation rates whenever possible.
Using the transcription and translation rate equations as seen above, the rates were calculated for the components Spo0A, Spo0B, Spo0F and KinA, and the results are reported in the table below.
Table 1: Transcription and Translation Rates
For components where information on the CDS length could not be found, we used the value 0.1 for both the translation and transcription rate.
Also, the values for the various rate constants could not be found in literature"
York_UK,2013,Team:York UK#Outreach.html_-_-_TEXT.html," We expected a lot of children to participate in the DNA Extraction experiment but in fact it was the adults who enjoyed it the most, especially some of the older visitors.
To summarise, the day was a roaring success. We feel people had a very good time experimenting with their DNA and think they learned a lot about our project, the competition and SynBio in general. The most novel aspect of this event was definitely the location, we were able to bring the world of science and religion together in a setting which is not often associated with the sort of jobs we do. This event would not have been possible without the generosity of the Church Staff and the help of some of our friends studying Genetics at the University of York; Tsvetelina, Elena and Jenny.
Alumni event
We have taken part in the Open day event for Alumni students, which was held at the Biology Department. It was a great opportunity for the York Graduates to see some of the on-going research in the Department and to be brought up to date with the projects funded by the York Annual Fund. Since our project received a significant amount of money from this fund, we were very excited about meeting the people, who actually paid for our research. Most of the people, who came were very excited by our work and were looking forward to learning more about it. Overall this outreach event was a great success as we managed to raise awareness of our project as well as the iGEM competition in general.
This could become a start of iGEM in The University of York and provide opportunities for young researchers to get more involved in synthetic biology.
YSB 1.0 London
As a UK team of iGEM we were invited to participate in the Young Synthetic Biologist 1.0 weekend held in the WelcomeTrust centre in London thanks to the organisation, as well as the sponsorship, of the Biochemical Society, Synthace; and University College London’s Department of Biochemical Engineering.
The event took place on July 12th and July 13th and five of us had the opportunity to represent the University of York’s iGEM team. The first day we were received at the WelcomeTrust and presented our project to the rest of the attendees. After listening to other teams’ ideas the organisation provided us with lunch; this was particularly positive since we had the opportunity to talk to other participants of iGEM (many more experienced than ourselves) and listen to their advice. We were also able to discuss the science topics presented earlier that morning.  In the afternoon we were offered to participate in a workshop of our choice. These included BioArt"

Introduction
IGEM encourages participants to conduct human practice, to see the world, and to exchange experience with other people. We love this idea because it offers us a chance to get inspired by the society, allows us to better understand the meaning of our scientific research, and constantly reminds us how and why we should contribute back to the society. Therefore, we strived to integrate human practice activity closely into our project advancement.
We began by surveying the public knowledge of intestinal diseases and by interviewing three leading professionals (doctors and researcher) to get a vivid understanding of the severity and incidence of intestinal diseases. We realized intestinal diseases including IBD, are big threats to human health, yet without a cure and without sufficient public acquaintance. We therefore decided to tangle IBD by engineered bacteria and succeeded in proof-of-concept experiment in using bacteria produced therapeutic agent (EGF) to alleviate IBD symptoms. During the communications with other teams , we received concerns on safety issues that we must deal with. So we upgraded our biosafety strategies by not only using two types of kill switches, but also using a 'warship' (which limits bacteria spreading and still allows nutrient and chemical exchanging). In addition, in the spirit of raising public interests, we established an IGEM Day for Public Interests (IDPI) to advertise the beauty of synthetic biology to the community. Meanwhile, we used posters and popular social media to introduce intestinal bowel disease and our work to the society.
Interviews
At the beginning of our project design, we thought of many possible treatments but during the process of reasoning we encountered some difficulties. In the spring of 2016, at National Center for Protein Science Shanghai, we interviewed Professor Pengfei Lu who was a researcher at the Paterson Institute for Cancer Research in the University of Manchester. He specializes in development and proliferation.

Antibiotice Resistance
Antibiotic
Resistance
Summary
Antibiotic resistance is an important part of evaluating the success of a synthetic biology experiment.  This test is usually performed after transforming your plasmid into your chassis organism. The resistance is due to selection markers that are placed within the plasmid that contains your biological part(s). The cells that were not transformed properly will die to their lack of resistance. The remaining cells can be utilized to perform subsequent experiments.

Jianyi HUANG
If ONLY I’m a MATH MAJOR!!!
Jianyi is a junior majoring in biology and minoring in mathematics.
This is the second year that she has been on UCAS iGEM team and also the second year that UCAS has joined iGEM community. She likes playing with DNA fragments and create something interesting out of basic elements.Unfortunately, she always regrets she hadn’t become a math major, especially when tons of data drove her mad. The good thing is that she would be happy with everything as long as she could stay in lab.
As a second-year iGEMer, she organized group meetings and trainings of new team members in the first stage. Responsible for our DEGRADATION MODULE, she devoted most of her time in lab.
She is also fluent in English and wrote the PROJECT part of our wiki. She plays the guitar and doesn’t talk much.
Jingnan YE
Easily pissed off when just getting up
Jingnan is a junior double majoring in biology and material sciences and engineering at UCAS.
She sincerely appreciates her excellent teammates and awesome instructors working and learning with her during this enjoyable year, from which she discovered more about what she hates and will never try in her future research.
She spent most of her time in the lab and on her way to the lab, while successfully spared some time to arrange a couple of HP activities and do some paperwork.
Outside the lab she is also a music lover, a pop dancer and an amateur bodybuilder. She believes exposing herself to music and art can help her keep good mood when the experiment fails again, and regular exercise can keep her working in the lab for more than 15 hours without feeling exhausted.

Crazy fan of Arya Stark
Jiang who wants to study alchemy is a sophomore majoring in chemistry at UCAS.
Though sufferring the frustrating failures which shouldn’t have been experienced at his age, he learned a lot and knew better about synthetic biology. Through all this one-year journey, he confirmed his ideal again to attempt establishing the biological world based on axiom system.
Making a plan, doing experiments and fail and planning again. Following this circle and eventually gained payback.
He is a chemist with an artistic heart, deeply attracted by CS and mathematics and has a final goal"

Oxford,2015,Team:Oxford#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," looked into the problems of insertion, removal and general life with having a catheter in place. Throughout the design process we constantly kept these issues in mind in order to create something that would not only help with infection, but would also be practical for the patient, doctor and manufacturer.
To get some more first hand experience of how small a catheter is, we purchased our very own. This struck home for us how small our containment method would have to be, with the typical internal volume being 43mm3 and 23mm3 for female and male catheters respectively. As UTIs mainly affect women we decided to buy a 14F female Foley catheter, which gave us a much better idea of the size we were working with: i.e. very small. Knowing this informed our choice of chemical for making containment beads for our bacteria. We also managed to obtain a few catheters from the local hospital. This opened our eyes to the sheer range of different catheter forms there were: different sizes, different materials, and different pipe configurations. Ultimately this lead us to choose to design a 3-way catheter.
Catheter diameters based on the French Catheter scale. Rangeing from 1mm to 1.13cm.
The idea of having a containment method as part of our project was first realised during the safety research as it would be dangerous to allow free bacteria into the human body. We started to incorporate the idea of a containment method into our project as we first realized during safety research that allowing free-living bacteria into the human body could potentially be dangerous. The bacteria could mutate, and lose and reacquire new genes, with no way for us to predict what could happen in several generations. There was a real chance of there being a negative impact on the patient’s health – perhaps fatally, depending on how badly we miscalculated our approach.
However, if we chose to seal our beads within the catheter then we would not be able to access them again as long as the catheter was left in place – doing so could allow for foreign bacteria to enter the urinary tract and cause further infection. Therefore, any nutrients our bacteria needed would have to be present inside the beads, or be available from the urine running through the catheter.
The bacteria would potentially need to be able to survive for 3 months – so ideally we would have been able to leave some beads for 3 months in the lab to test their longevity. Sadly the timescale of the project did not allow us to do that as it was only until the later stages of the project that we came up with the idea of bead"

Measuring data for BIT-China
When iGEMers from BIT-China asked us whether we could allow them to use our Cytation Multi-Mode readers to monitor the gcolumnth state and fluorescence emissions of their engineered yeast, we agreed without hesitation. BIT-China wanted to detect both OD and fluorescence intensity simultaneously for up to 30 hours to evaluate the function of their yeast. With our help, they needn’t get up and take samples early in the morning but can obtain a much larger amount of data, saving them trouble and improving the reliability.

Objective
The focus of this years' projects is to question the central dogma of biology. This is the commonly held belief that information flows from the ordering of the bases within a cell's DNA to the ordering of the bases within RNA. This information can then be translated to the order of Amino Acids that make up proteins. We are currently working on projects that question aspects of this dogma.
Project 1: Codon Optimization
Project Overview
All of the proteins around us, with few exceptions, are made up of 20 fundamental building blocks - Amino Acids. Different arrangements and combinations of these basic building blocks gives us the diversity of proteins that we see, but to make these we need information. We need to know the order of the bases. This information is held within the order of a messenger RiboNucleic Acid's (mRNA) bases; Adenine, Guanine, Thymine, and Uracil. (mRNA is in essence a ""photocopy"" of DNA that codes for a gene. <p/> <p> Since there are only 4 bases in RNA and there are 20 Amino Acids, there are not enough bases to directly code for all of the Amino Acids. Nature has a solution for this - codons. Codons are groups of three bases that sode for a single amino acid. There are 64 possible combinations of codons (4 x 4 x 4 = 64). These combinations are degenerate, meaning that you can have more than one codon code for the same Amino Acid.
Proteins are assembled by ribosomes, which read the mRNA and catalyze the binding between Amino Acids. However, they cannot read the codon code themselves, and require the help of tRNA (transfer RNA)."

It displayed the KeggID and common name of each intermediate, as well as the reaction ID's that correspond to the returned pathway. It's final feature to date, is listing the cofactors and additional substrates that were assumed to be present for the pathway to succeed.

Biobricks!! - The goal of our project will be to provide the user with all the biobricks that code for all the enzymes needed for a particular reaction pathway.  So first, we will have to figure out the genes that code for all the enzymes that will carry out a particular pathway.  First, we will take the nucleotide sequences for these genes and check whether the exact sequence already exists in the existing biobrick database.  So we will have to scan through the biobrick registry to compare our sequences with the existing sequences.  Since the current biobrick registry only has about 3200 parts, it is highly unlikely that the exact sequence will already be existing.  However, if any of the sequences do already exist, the program will tell the user that the biobrick for that particular gene already exists, and for the remaining sequences, the program will construct biobricks for all these genes and display them for the user. Now from what I think, each biobrick will be one gene.  (Because one enzyme cant come from two different genes, but one gene can code for several proteins).  Each gene can either code for a single enzyme, or multiple enzymes.  So if a particular reaction pathway contains 20 enzymes, there may be up to 20 different biobricks.  The program will add the appropriate suffix and prefix to the sequences, assign them to a biobrick standard, and then present them in a proper biobrick format.  (Now Im not sure if we could combine these biobricks into one biobrick, since all the biobricks code for one reaction).  So the user then can order all these biobricks, and then in lab, can insert these plasmids into a bacteria and carry out"

Today, we hit another wall, as we attempted to figure out how to properly visualize the DNA strands.

We had previously realized that we could not use an ordinary gel extraction kit, since our DNA strands were too small and would likely be lost in the filtration process.  We researched various gel extraction kits designed for short nucleotide sequences, and all of their DNA loss rates were unacceptable for our purposes.

Mark Ditzler at NASA Ames told us his strategies for extracting RNA from denaturing gels using UV shadowing.  Unfortunately, we realized that we do not have the proper UV lamp (254nm) with which to do this.  Apparently these lamps are infrequently used because they damage DNA.

StanfordBrownSpelman,2014,Team:StanfordBrownSpelman#Amberless Hell Cell_-_-_TEXT.html,"-2S serve as a negative control. In wild type cells that contain the GFP-2S and supP tRNA, fluorescence is observed in a small population of cells, and it is much less intense than in the amberless cells. Normally, the supP tRNA is toxic to wild type E. coli, but when these cells expressing some GFP were sequenced, we found mutations in the tRNA. This indicates that with some mutations, the supP tRNA can be tolerated in wild type cells. There mixed population of low-GFP expressing and non-expressing DH5-alpha cells suggest that the mutations render less efficient tRNAs that impair the translation of the complete protein product. This indicates that our Codon Security strategy is effective in significantly reducing protein expression in wild type cells.
Figure 5. Mean fluorescence from flow cytometry data in Figure 4. The data show a high mean fluorescence in amberless cells and a much lower mean fluorescence in DH5-alpha cells containing the same construct. .
Our results with the chromogenic aeBlue protein test construct further corroborate the  effectiveness of Codon Security in preventing gene expression in non-amberless E. coli. We created a version of Team Uppasala's 2012 aeBlue protein with 3 UAG stop codons substituted for leucine (aeBlue-3S) and added the supP tRNA to create a test construct called aeBlue-3S+tRNA. This was sequence verified and BioBricked ( BBa_K1499253 ) in the Amberless cells. Then, we transformed the cleaned-up BioBrick plasmid into Amberless and DH5-alpha cells using the exact same heat shocking and plating protocol (Fig. 6).
Figure 6. Plates after transforming (at Day 0) DH5-alpha and Amberless cells with aeBlue-3S+tRNA. At Day 1, after overnight incubation at 37C, there are no DH5-alpha colonies, but there are over 200 Amberless colonies. At Day 5, 4 days of room temperature incubation, Amberless colonies express the aeBlue protein and colonies appear in DH5-alpha plate, although possibly because of degradation of Chlor antibiotic. Side-by-side comparison of cell pellets shows that only Amberless strongly express the blue protein.
.
As seen in Figure 6, we observed that the sequence-verified aeBlue-3S+tRNA construct could only be transformed into and expressed in Amberless cells. The kinetics of blue protein accumulation in the Amberless cells were relatively slow compared to GFP, with first"

The Team
The DTU iGEM Team 2015 is composed of a group of ten motivated DTU students dedicated to exploring and sharing their passion for science. The team includes both Bachelor and Master students with a diverse set of nationalities and educational backgrounds in Biochemistry, Molecular Biology, Bioinformatics, Pharmaceutical engineering and Computer Sciences. Many of the team members are highly engaged in internationally recognized research groups, leading biotech companies or student organizations, where they have obtained valuable competences within science, programming, project management and communication.  Our team is unified by the shared goal of providing significant achievements within the field of synthetic biology.
The project officially started with an introductory iGEM meeting in January, facilitated by our supervisor Chris Workman. From then on our team met weekly with idea development until Mads and Pernille, came up with our project idea. Many months of project planning, fundraising, lab work and coding have lead to the product we now present for you. All laboratory work and presented activities documented on this wiki were performed by our team members and the three high school students unless stated otherwise.
We would like to thank our advisors who assisted us during the whole project and have provided invaluable advice and feedback. We would also express our thanks to everyone else who has supported us over the course project! Thank you for your expertise, facilities and materials. A full list of attributions can be seen here .
