LCD projector and LED Illuminator are merged by a double LH Adapter contained a semi-transparent mirror, which connect to microscope. So we can use these two light source in the same time. To achieve the aim, we add additional filter to purify the red light and blue light and replace new lens to adjust the focus distance(Fig. 2).

We try develop a powerful and hackable open source software suite called ColorMapping to track and activate multi C. elegans or cell independently in one view(Fig. 3). User can modify multi color, intensity, time, locations of light alternately. ColorMapping can be found in GitHub , which still is developing.

Cells of today's fermentation of E. coli KRX with BBa_K863121 were disrupted via high-pressure homogeniser and purified by using the Ni NTA column. The flow-through fluoresced very strong, so that not that much of the protein had bound to the column. Conclusion: The column had to be reloaded.
Fermentation of E. coli KRX containing BBa_K863000 .
Settings: fermenter: Braun, autoinduction medium, 60 µg/mL chloramphenicol, 3 L, 37 °C, stirrer on cascade to hold a pO2 of 50 %, airflow: 2 NL/m, 9 hours. We only cultivated 9 hours, because we saw that a great amount of our cells already died.
Made precultures of E. coli KRX containing BBa_K863000 , BBa_K863005 and one containing BBa_K863113 .
Figure 2: Activity in oxidizing ABTS of our produced BPUL laccase depending on time. Values are calculated by taking the average out of 4 measurements (n=4).
Team Activity Tests:
Today our hard-working Team Cultivation offered us some BPUL laccases. After fermentation and Ni NTA purification the laccase was still hanging around in imidazole buffer, so we rebuffered it into nanopure water. We incubated the sample with copper and considered to measure the protein concentration before running the activity tests. Using the protocol for determining the protein concentration via Bradford (standards were 1 mg/ml, 1.5 mg/ml and 2 mg/ml BSA) we got a final BPUL laccase concentration of 0.22 mg/ml. With this information we designed the following activity test different as usual. As a positive control we took 140 µl of our bought laccase TVEL0 with a concentration of 0,021 mg/ml. Accordingly to this concentration we applied 14 µl of the BPUL laccase to get approximately the same amount of laccase into each well. Additionally we tested 140 µl of the BPUL laccase to make sure that we will definitely see any activity. After measuring the samples the whole night we got our results in the morning. It turned out, that our store bought laccase TVEL0 was rapidly active as seen before in our activity tests. The BPUL laccase was also active. Using 140 µl of it led to the maximal state of oxidation of AB"

Introduction to Policy and Practices(PNP)
iGEM 2017
University of Waterloo iGEM,  2017
Welcome to Waterloo’s iGEM Policy and Practices team! This guide is designed to help members understand what our team is about and the logistics behind our roles for the project. In the next few pages, this guide will focus on the i    GEM competition, responsibilities of PNP, how we work to fulfil those responsibilities, and the selection process of our annual project.
What is the iGEM Competition?
The International Genetically Engineered Machines (iGEM) Foundation is a non-profit organization dedicated to the education and advancement of synthetic biology, as well as promoting an open science community and collaboration.
One of their three main programs is the annual iGEM Competition, also known as the Jamboree, which is hosted in Boston every year. Student teams around the world build genetically engineered systems using standard biological parts called BioBricks and showcase their parts at the Jamboree, competing for various awards and prizes.
iGEM projects are organized into specific subject areas. The standard ten parts-based tracks are as follows: Diagnostics,  Energy, Environment, Food & Nutrition, Foundational Advance, High School, Information Processing, Manufacturing, New Applications, and Therapeutics. Additionally there are four Special Tracks, which are showcased in a separate space at the Jamboree and although are not eligible for the Grand Prize.
At the Jamboree, iGEM teams will be competing for various awards, including Medals, Track Awards, and Special Awards. Any number of teams can win one of three levels of medals: Bronze, Silver and Gold. Each level of award has its own specific medal criteria, and teams must prove to judges that they have fulfilled them all to earn the medal.
iGEM teams can also win other special awards. While any number of teams can be awarded medal standards, only one team can win each of the following awards:
The Grand Prize: awarded to one team based on the overall    excellence of their entire project
Standard Track: awarded to the team with the best project in    each Standard Track
Special Track Awards: awarded to the team with the best    project in each Special Track
Special Prizes: awarded to honour unique and innovative    contributions to iGEM including: Best Poster, Best
Presentation, Best Wiki, Best New Basic Part, etc...

Team Technion Israel
Team Technion has been very helpful to us in various aspects of iGEM competition. They made significant contribution in our mathematical modeling and lab protocol optimization. They reviewed and modified equations, and fine–tuned our modeling parameters. They also translated system equations into Matlab code for simulation as none of us were well–versed in MATLAB. They provided us the time frames for lab work. They were generous to share lab protocols and helped us troubleshoot the steps that weren't yielding any results.
Team Vilnius Lithuania
Team Vilnius gave us an overview of iGEM Competition and its different aspects. They shared ideas about human practices and public outreach. They elaborated the iGEM lab work in quite detail, which helped us in making a detailed experimental plan and schedule.
Team IIT Kharagpur India
Our collaboration with the IIT team has been limited to Skype sessions. We shared insights about effective human practices. We discussed construct designs and exchanged thoughts on improving it.
The Dawood Foundation
The Dawood Foundation is an educational foundation in Pakistan whose main focus is to support and promote educational initiatives in the field of science, technology, and research. This year, they organized 'Magnifi-Science' — a three–day science fair of gigantic proportion in Karachi where we set up our 'Bio–Machines Lab' and shared Synthetic Biology with almost 4500 students, teachers, parents, and other members of the community.
We would like to thank the Dawood Foundation and Ms. Sabrina Dawood for supporting our endeavour and providing us with the space and opportunity to spread SynBio awareness at such a scale in Pakistan.
Team XMU China
XMU China, a team from Xiamen University, provided a platform for exchange of information for iGEM teams by launching a newsletter. We shared our project details, human practice activities, and our contact information in the newsletter. We have collaborated with teams who published their project information in it. We thank them for making collaborations easier and for inviting us to be a part of it. The newsletter can be found here .
We were fascinated by their project idea that dealt with antibiotic resistance. Since a lack of public awareness plays a key role in exacerbating this problem, we helped them gather data about public knowledge and experiences related to antibiotic use.

was RCA workshop open / on meetup? - it was for iGEM team members only not on Meetup
Any more headshots? Yes - Maria will email them, some folks switched out what they have, I will send updated slide or I can send the emails with the pics
Can we get a picture of people at BioCurious connecting over zoom, - we can try
iGEM labs ~$500 a year and get DNA distribution and can submit parts year round
TOm - at ccl  will send him info on project -
Indiegogo - add new reward of color changing beads, get more people to donate!

Overview
This year team XMU-China developed cell-free systems to detect and treat diseases. Protein detection is unique and significant in biology fields, especially for the detection of protein biomarkers which produced by diseased cells. In order to overcome the deficiencies of traditional detection methods, we have developed an Aptamer Based Cell-free Detection system (ABCD system) of protein. The core of the ABCD system is the specific binding of the aptamer and its target protein. After protein detection, we use outer-membrane vesicles (OMVs) to treat the diseased cells. We designed a system that has realized the efficient, customizable production of OMVs, which serves to encapsulate specific siRNA for disease treatment. To guarantee the practicability detection and treatment system, we also improved KaiABC system and TDPs system to regulate the expression rate of OMVs and store fragile chemicals or biological materials.
In order to equip our idea with social demands, we have been practicing all through our project by conducting investigation on diseases detection and corresponding information, visiting biotechnology company to gain a better knowledge about the diseases detection, interacting with public to propagate synthetic biology and learning from teams applied themselves in diseases detection theme. We divided these activities in four stages which are Laws and Regulations, Inspiration and Reality, Public and"

College of Agriculture, Biotechnology, and Natural Resources Valley Road Field Day
On September 8th, Team Nevada presented their research to the public at the CABNR's Valley Road Field Day. Because this was a more family-oriented event, we had a kid-friendly interactive presentation in addition to our poster presentation. In order to teach children about cell biology and the roles of various organelles in the cell, we handed out ""jello cells"" and allowed the children to add their own ""candy organelles"" --after they learned the function of each organelle, of course.
A Survey of the Effects of Education on Attitudes Toward GM Rice and iRICE
One of our goals for our project was to see if people would be willing to eat iRICE. We decided to conduct a survey to get the public's opinions on iRICE as well as genetically modified rice. The format of the survey process began with basic demographic information and a quiz to see how much the person being surveyed knew about genetically modified golden rice. After this, participants were given an information sheet about Golden Rice, which contained basic scientific information as well as information about the pros and cons of golden rice. The rest of the questions were then about how comfortable participants would be eating golden rice, and whether or not they would prefer eating iRICE.
Click the previews below to view our survey and info sheet!
However, an interesting issue arose when we conducted our survey: regardless of how much people knew about golden rice originally, after learning more about it by reading our information sheet, the majority of people were willing to eat GM rice. In fact, most of them even said they would prefer it to our iRICE supplement! We believe this reveals a greater problem at hand. People's attitudes toward genetically modified organisms are related (at least in part) to how informed they are. Although participants were given a full information sheet about golden rice, very little information about our project was on the survey --and their opinions reflected this. Our survey actually turned out to be more beneficial as a teaching tool than a survey, and hopefully will contribute to the idea that the public needs to be kept in the loop as science advances forward.

In order to compute a probable structure for our botulinum toxin C, we used the SWISS-Model fully automated web server for homology modelling, which automatically searches the most closely related sequences with known experimentally determined tertiary structure.  The best match for the botulinum neurotoxin c was the botulinum neurotoxin b, which has a sequence identity of ~34 % and a sequence similarity of ~52 % . We created the homology model based on the structure 2PN0 as template (Figure 1).
Figure 1: Protein strucutre  of the homology model of botulinum neurotoxin c based on class B neurotoxin. The light chain of the proteins is defined as the globular domain on the left of the picture (blue), with a central zinc ion (grey). The remaining part of the protein is defined as the heavy chain
To check the quality of the homology model, we checked the zinc coordination of the active site of the protein with the participating amino acids. Especially the geometry and the distance of the amino acids to the zinc ion are particularly interesting, since those factors are crucial for the stability of the active site itself. We used the known protein structure of the botulinum toxin light chain, which has been crystallized without the heavy chain (PDB ID: 2QN0).
The homology modeled botulinum neurotoxin shows a similar zinc coordination then the actual light chain structure, with similar distance between the amino acids and the zinc ion.  Examining the Ramachandran plot, which plots the psi and phi angles of the backbone atoms, no irregularities were found, which indicates a reasonable tertiary structure. According to the placement of the residues in the Ramachandran plot due to their phi and psi angles, it is possible to identify unlikely structures.

We then tried to verify the homology model using MD simulations. For this purpose, we used the MD simulation software GROMCAS 2016.3. For the force field we chose AMBER99SB since it allows the modelling of proteins containing metals like zinc. Furthermore, the AM"

BBa_K1991007 : Pcons-RBS-LO-BamHI/pSB1C3
Lpp and OmpA are outer membrane proteins of E. coli. Lpp-OmpA (LO) hybrid can direct heterologous proteins to bacterial cell surface. In 2015, NCTU-Formosa used it to display scFv (single chain fragment variable) antibodies on the surface of E. coli. They found that a fusion protein cannot be possible to be created under the standard BioBrick assembly rule, that is EcoRI(E)-XbaI(X)-GENE-SpeI(S)-PstI(P). The A part of EX-LO-SP and the B part of EX-scFV-SP, for example, are connected by cutting and ligation of SpeI plus PstI for the A part and XbaI plus PstI for the B part. The SCAR generated by XbaI/SpeI (ACTAGA) will form a stop codon just in front of the ATG start codon of the scFV protein of the B part. This situation has been officially mentioned by the BioBrick standard assembly .
Figure 5: Limitation of cloning a fusion protein by standard biobrick assembly
 
 
Therefore, in 2015, NCTU-Formosa created a novel part ( BBa_K1694002 ) putting NcoI site between the LO part and SpeI site. However, when considering cloning, we found that an extra NcoI site is present on Cm resistance gene making it difficult be a vector for gene cloning.
In 2016, Mingdao improved the part by replacing NcoI site with BamHI site ( BBa_K1991004 ). Also, we’ve confirmed and prove the function of LO directing a fusion protein to the cell surface with enzyme activity in our project.

Manchester,2013,Team:Manchester#conferencetest_-_-_TEXT.html," we contacted a local branch of a national environmental group (as the opinions of the members present may not be representative of the larger organisation, they wish to remain anonymous). This conversation was very interesting, and the group was very grateful for it as they said there is not enough two-way dialogue between scientists and environmentalists. We discussed a wide range of topics, from things directly linking to our project such as flaws of the RSPO and governance issues, to more general topics such as the relationship between scientists and the general public.
These meetings, in addition to conversations with other industry representatives from around the world, informed nearly all aspects of our project. In particular, the ideas discussed have been summarised in our essay, entitled ‘Public Attitudes To Science and the Knowledge Deficit Assumption: How To Avoid A Crisis Of Confidence’ )

In a word, from the statistics above, both the resource and the number of respondents ensure that our survey is of convincing credit.
There is a lack of useful and convincing information about the treatment of pollution. The public are looking forward to further propagation. It shows public awareness of environmental protection and their hope for open information.
Although the public have shown much attention to water contamination, yet their knowledge is quite limited and they remain pessimistic about current conditions. We believe environmental organizations and governmental departments should inform the public of current conditions in time and promote eco-friendly ideas.
As to the heavy metal contamination, the public merely know a little about it. As to our project “Metallosniper”, even though they are not familiar with it now, yet they hold positive attitudes about its future development. Therefore, we can focus on promoting the harmful influences of heavy metal contamination and potential prospects about biological treatments. In that way, we can further propagate our project. Please click here to see the detail of the questionnaire.
Propagation of iGEM
In late August, we were invited to visit Nanjing Normal University on occasion during which we talked with Prof. Chuanchao Dai in School of Life Science. We have also shown to him our iGEM project as well as the iGEM competition. Prof. Dai showed great interest in it and told us that he intended to organize their students to participate in the competition in 2016. We promised him we would spare no efforts to help them organize a team. Nanjing Normal University has been a normal school and values tremendously about nurturing teachers. Therefore, it will benefit a large community if we help them participate in the iGEM competition."

The PCR amplification was repeated for FeFe gene inserts. These were then digested, extracted and purified from the agarose gel. FeFe genes inserts were ligated with the BioBrick vector. The ligations reactions were set up with different ratios of vector and insert (1:1 and 1:3) and incubated  overnight. These were transformed into α-select Gold Efficiency E.coli cells by heat shock the following day and plated out. Four plates showed colonies and successful ligations i.e. HydC/Fdh 1:1, HydC/Fdh 1:3, HydA 1:3 and HydB C-terminus 1:3. Digestion reactions were set up for the NiFe genes: HyaC, HyaA and HyaB N- and C-terminus followed by ligations.
Week 5 1.08-5.08
The successful colonies for HydC/Fdh, HydA and HydB C-terminus were inoculated in 10ml LB  overnight. Following mini-prep plasmid purification, PCR confirmed correct ligations. The gel results showed unexpected sizes for some of the samples and suggested that some of the samples had been mis-labelled. DNA from new overnight cultures of HydC/Fdh, HydA and HydB C-terminus were obtained by mini-prep and a restriction digest was carried out to verify the results. Digests of HydB N-terminus, HyaC, HyaA, HyaB N-terminus and HyaB C-terminus were set up, however following gel purification concentrations were too low, thus transformations did not yield results.
Week 6 8.08-12.08
We repeated the PCR amplification of FeFe units along with NiFe genes inserts. With new primers for HyaB N- and C-terminus gene insert. Gel showed successful amplification of FeFe gene inserts and HyaB N-terminus. The FeFe subunits were digested alongside samples of RFP DNA.

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Acknowledgement_-_-_TEXT.html,"SELF Conference is a TED-like forum jointly set up by CAS Computer Network Information Center and CAS Science Communication Bureau, inviting elites to share new ideas and discoveries. Its name is the abbreviation respective of Science, Education, Life and Future.
This time, we invited Ph.D. Haoqian Zhang, who is once an iGEMer and now the chief technology officer of a syn-bio company Bluepha, to give a speech on SELF Conference. Aiming at promoting synthetic biology, the speech talked about its principle, significance and various applications. In this conference which more than two hundred people attended, our UCAS iGEM team members offered volunteer services and have a really good time!
Overview
Aiming at designing an effective, convenient and cheap device to detect ammonia for fish farmers, we believe that our device has the potential to be applied in the real ponds and reach commercial success. The following is a summary of our work on entrepreneurship, including the discussion on product application, market analysis and financial summary.
Product Application
Since a patent is needed if we want to apply our device on real ponds, we went to the department of transformation of scientific and technological achievements in Institute of Biophysics, and asked for advice. During the communication with the staff there, we learned about the process of applying a patent and noted significant issues. At present, we are planning to apply a patent for our designs after the project is finished.
Market Analysis Summary
In China, freshwater aquaculture is the most important production method in the fishery industries. Among all aquaculture modes, ponds account for over 75% of the product. Nevertheless, few farming ponds in China are equipped with ammonia monitoring and water purification systems, causing pollution and fish diseases and reduced aquaculture production.
We compared our designs with other methods on the market which are widely used currently, and find our designs having the obvious advantages such as cheaper, cleaner and more convenient.

Statistical Region Merging (SRM)
Before briefly introducing Statistical Region Merging (SRM), we would like to explain why we need this step, and why this algorithm is an ideal choice.
Compared to other clustering algorithms, SRM is quite leight weight, yet delivers deterministic results and is not dependent on a certain seed (like k-means, for example).
On the other hand, it can create as many refinements as one wants and is thus flexible enough for the our purposes. Finally, there's already been knowledge about this algorithm in the group.
Statistical Region Merging (SRM) (Nook and Nielson, 2004) is a clustering technique also used directly for image segmentation. A region $R$ is a set of pixels and the cardinality $\lvert R \rvert$ determines how many pixels are in one region. Starting with a sorted set of connected regions (w. r. t. some distance function $f$), two regions $R$ and $R'$ are merged if the qualification criteria $\vert \overline{R'}-\overline{R} \vert \leq \sqrt{b^2(R)+b^2(R')}$ with $b(R) = g \cdot \sqrt{\frac{\ln \frac{\mathcal{R}_{\lvert R \rvert}}{\delta}}{2Q\lvert R \rvert}}$ is fulfilled. Therefore, $\mathcal{R}_{\lvert R \rvert}$ is the set of regions with $\lvert R \rvert$ pixels. Typically $Q$ is chosen as $Q \in \lbrack 256, 1\rbrack$ and $\delta = \frac{1}{\lvert I \rvert^2}$.
The $Q$ parameter mainly influences the merging process. For an example, see the figure SRM Regions below. The lower the chosen value for $Q$, more coarse the regions become. Using a union-find structure, the segmentation does not need to be recalculated for each $Q$ level. For the step from $q$ to $\frac{q}{2}$, just the qualification criteria needs to be applied to the regions from the $q$ result. A MATLAB implementation is also available (Boltz, 2009).

Survey
    We did a survey about women in the academic evioronment to see how people perceive it and draw some statistics on the current situation in Brazil. Our purpose was to better understand this topic by knowing the proportion of women on the course over the years, how they were compared with their male counterparts, if they were ever discriminated or harassed during university, etc. Remember that the survey was performed with a rather small number of participants, and should be seen as a scrap in the surface of what people really of about the subject.
Almost 340 brazilian students participated with the survey, especially those from University of São Paulo. The data we have gathered can be seen below.
What is your gender?
We have used in the questionaire ""define your gender"", understanding gender in a broad sense .
When did you attend to college?
We see that there is a strong profile of people who just got into college.
In your opinion, there is segregation and gender harassment in the academic environment?
There is an apparent agreement among both women and men regarding this topic: there is some level of gender discrimination.
Is discrimination against women in your opinion a real problem?
How may women who enrolled colleg with you dropped out before finishing it?
Do you believe women have disadvantages in your course because?
Here are the possible answers: 1- Yes, they are too sentimental
2- Yes, because men are naturals
3- Yes, because there is a larger enrollment of men
4- No, because there is no kind of discrimination at all
5- No, because women are naturals
6- No, because there are no distinctions between man and women
7- Other
Contact with PyLadies
    Especially in the so-called hard sciences, women engagement seems particularly low. It is very hard to deny some kind of gender disparity, although the reason might very well be disputable (be it prejudice or simply a matter of taste). Several initiatives have emerged over the last decade to encourage more and more women to become active in such areas. Just a famous and popular example is the Women"

Introduction
In general, extracting something from E. coli, there are some annoying procedures (e.g., centrifugation, sonication…). To avoid them, we focus on autolysis system. In the autolysis system of T4 phage, holin and endolysin make E. coli lyse. Holin proteins causes ""pores"" in the inner membrane of E. coli, which allows endolysin to access and break down the peptidoglycan in the periplasm, causing lysis. So, we construct the autolysis device with these lysis proteins for disruption of E. coli. And more, for severe control of autolysis, we designed the trigger of the autolysis is quorum sensing which would be induced by aggregation of E. coli in EcoTanker system. We propose the autolysis device containing holin and endolysin which is easy and controlled method of extracting the EcoTanker.
What is this device composed inside it?
Autolysis device includes some lysis protein, Holin, Endolysin and Anti-holin. All of these proteins are derived from enterobacteria phage T4. Holin proteins causes ""pores"" in the inner membrane of E. coli, which allows endolysin to access and break down the peptidoglycan in the periplasm, causing lysis (Fig.1) [1]. Antiholin binds holin and prevents holin multimers from forming pores on the inner membrane of bacteria. When the device is off, higher expression of antiholin compared to holin is required for better stability of the device [2]. We will construct the autolysis device with these lysis proteins from a registry part BBa_K1128808 (Berkeley team (iGEM 2008)).
Quorum sensing, a mechanism present in some microorganisms by which a bacterium can detect the presence of other bacteria in the neighborhood. Quorum sensing is the regulation system of gene expression in response to cell-population density. Quorum sensing bacteria produce and release chemical signal molecules called autoinducers (AI) that increase in concentration as a cell density (cell"

Bordeaux,2015,Team:Bordeaux#Description_-_-_TEXT.html,". This strategy did not work. We then tried to put a inductive promoter ahead of the relevant gene by homologous recombination. We put the Gal1 promoter and a selective gene HIS3 (to select our successful transformants) in front of FKS1. Gal1 promoter and HIS3 was extract by PCR from pFA 6a-HIS3MX6-pGAL-3HA . On the other hand, we will integrate the FKS1 gene into the iGEM plasmid pSB1C3 to get our BioBrick that we'll send to Boston. This genetic construction with HIS3 gene  and GAL1 promoter was inserted in pSB1C3 by Gibson assembly. However, site-directed mutagenesis may be necessary when integrating the gene into the plasmid because there are restriction sites (EcoR1) that are unwanted within the HIS3 gene.
« It's very clear now. It looks like a cool project. But, i have a last question: why did you choose this subject? »

Other useful properties of Curdlan
Curdlan, the linear (1→3)-β-glucan from Agrobacterium, has unique rheo-logical and thermal gelling properties. It is neutral and insoluble in water and if it is heated in an aqueous suspension, it adopts simple helical conformations (55-80°C) or a triple helical connected conformation (80-130°C). [1] It then acts as a gelling agent and form two types of gels (low-set gel or high-set gel which have been documented by Zhang et al [3]). Apart from being tasteless, colourless and odourless, its advantages are that, in contrast to cold-set gels (e.g. gelatin, gellan, carrageenan) and heat-set gels (e.g. konjac glucomannan, methylcellulose), the heating process alone produces different forms of curdlan gels with different textural qualities, physical stabilities and water-holding capacities. Curdlan gels are widely used in the food industry as a food additive ( E424 ) and to develop new food products (e.g. freezable tofu noodles). It is also used in calorie-re"

Collaboration  – Convince the judges you have significantly worked with any other registered iGEM team in a meaningful way.
At the beginning of iGEM, we created a flyer showcasing the strengths of our team and the various ways we could help other teams. As a result of this, we were contacted by three teams: Edinburgh overgraduate team , Exeter , and Evry Paris-Saclay . For the Edinburgh team, we used our modelling knowledge to help fix their model. We aided the Exeter team by repeating one of their experiments, and they gathered single-cell fluorescence data for our deGFP construct using their FACS machine. Finally, Paris designed a novel psicose-regulated promoter to be used in a biosensor. We then incorporated their promoter into our framework so that many different variants of a psicose biosensor could be designed, made and tested. Check out our collaboration page for more information

Do any of the new BioBrick parts (or devices) that you made this year raise any safety issues?
Our new BioBricks do not raise any foreseeable safety issues. The Biobrick parts we made are transcription terminators, which is not translated into protein.
Is there a local biosafety group, committee, or review board at your institution?
•  If yes, what does your local biosafety group think about your project?
•  If no, which specific biosafety rules or guidelines do you have to consider in your country?
Our university (SUSTC) is a brand new university which is established in 2011. So far, we do not have a biosafety committee in our institute. We performed our experiment mostly in another institute BGI nearby, their lab fulfill the requirement of Lab Biosafty level 2, which enable us to perform bacterial (E.coli) experiment safely. Many professor and assistant from biology and chemistry department of SUSTC care our safety and have checked the laboratory we used and the processes we have done. And they think the condition we were working is safe and reliable
Do you have any other ideas how to deal with safety issues that could be useful for future iGEM competitions? How could parts, devices and systems be made even safer through biosafety engineering?
Here is our suggestions to iGEM headquarter:
Since many igem team members are very young, some of them may take lab course before. They are not familar with the lab safty guidline. Therefore, wet lab team members should take at least general biology lab course before they perform igem lab work.

Restriction Digest of Extracted PCR product
Restriction digest was performed using EcoRI-HF (5’) and SpeI (3’) restriction enzymes.
NEB’s Double Digest Finder was invoked and it was determined that CutSmart Buffer would be used for the digest.
The buffer was completely defrosted and shaken before use.
There is a recommended digestion protocol on NEB Cloner. 50µL reaction mixtures were set up with component volumes as recommended, except for the DNA where all 30µL of the extraction mixture (in elution buffer) were used in the digest. There would be up to 50ng of DNA in each tube of extraction mixture (from the gel bands).
Incubation at 37℃ was also done for 2 hours (ThermoMixer program 3) instead of the recommended 5-15 minutes, with shaking at 300rpm.
Restriction Enzyme Digest of the iGEM HQ linearised pSB-1c3
125ng of pSB-1C3 was dissolved in 5mL Milli-Q water.
The digest was performed using the modified NEBCloner protocol.
* We did not add phosphatase because it is assumed that with different sticky ends the vector cannot religate
DNA ‘Cleanup’ using EZNA enzymatic reaction kit
Upon completion of restriction digest incubation, the gBlocks and the plasmid backbones were purified again using the E.Z.N.A. Gel Extraction Kit. PCR products and plasmid backbones need to be purified in order to remove remaining impurities including agarose gel and restriction enzymes. At the elution step, the gBlock inserts were eluted using 30µL elution buffer whereas the plasmid backbone was eluted using 50µL of it.
DNA Quantification using NanoDrop
1µL water and tissue were first used to clean the stage. A blank reading was made using 1µL of elution buffer, and 1µL of each sample was measured for concentration:

Mean values are shown in the graph. The error line stands for the standard deviation.
Fig.3-7 Picture of survival rate experiment results. Growth media: YPD. Experimental strain: S5; control strain: synX. Cells were plated onto the media after immersed in 50 mM copper solution for 10 minutes, 30minutes, 1 hour, and 2hours.
The Fig.3-6 and Fig.3-7 showcase that the survival rate of S5 is higher than that of synX after yeast cells are immersed in copper ions solutions of identical concentration for the same amount of time. The quantitative results are that compared with the control strain, the experimental strain S5's ability to tolerate copper ions has increased by 74% (1 hour), 72% (2 hours), and 698% (3 hours). It also can be extrapolated that the gap of survival rates between the mutated strain and synX strain will continue to widen as the immersion time increases. The results are consistent with the dilution assay too.
EXPECTATIONS
We are exhilarated to see that SCRaMbLE is really a feasible technology to enhance the yeast's ability to cope with adverse environmental conditions. Not just heavy metal ions, we are looking forward to seeing its future applications, be they, for example, alcohol tolerance or heat tolerance.

We did a Kapa PCR of BBa_J04500 + TALE A , but the gel of the PCR products showed a band size that was approximately 1000bp less than expected. This PCR was done so we could use it for other constructions. Instead we ordered new primers to try a different approach to our remaining constructs.
Figure 22.Verification digest on construct 11*.
Now that we have our TALEs we need to express them. We are experimenting using different time points and IPTG amounts to determine how to best express our proteins. We will be running our samples on SDS PAGE gels next week.
Week 17: August 19 - August 23
This week we repeated overnight cultures, minipreps, and sequencing of BBa_J04500 + TALE A and construct 11* ( pSBIC3 - BBa_J04500 - TALE A -link-Blac), as previous sequencing results were inconclusive.
For TALE protein characterization and expression we did a trial run to determine the optimum time point and IPTG concentration.
We subcultured our overnight cultures of TALE A , TALE B , the positive control RFP and the negative control BBa_J04500 . For each pellet and supernatant, we had 3 time points 3 hours, 6.5 hours, and 24 hours and 3 IPTG concentrations of 0.1mM, 0.4mM, and 0.8mM for a total of 72 samples on 8 SDS page gels. Our results indicate that the optimum IPTG concentration is 4mM and 8mM IPTG and induction time of 3 hours and 6.5 hours.
A subsequent SDS page gel was run with TALE A , TALE B , Beta lactamase, BBa_J04500 , and RFP .
We also received new primers for construct 10 and 11. We set up a PCR of the construct 10 primers and BBa_J04500 + TALE A template DNA. The gel of the PCR products showed 1800bp bands, which were too small. We repeated the PCR with an increased extension time and the gel showed bands of the expected size. The PCR product was purified and cut with BsaI, ligated together and transformed.
We set up a PCR of the construct 11 primers and BBa_J04500 + TALE A and BBa_J04500 + TALE B template DNA."

Unfortunately, the current setup relies on saving the code opened/typed into the PS window to a ""testing.py"" file, which is what the Python interpreter compiles by default.
Update: The runtime process now no longer relies solely on the ""testing.py"" for executing previously-saved code.  Instead, it uses the selected file once the user opens/saves their work.  This change is also accurately reflected within the custom command option, which either presents the default ""testing.py"" choice or the current file appended to the default run-command text.
An issue that I still cannot figure out concerns why Swapnil cannot see the Python syntax-highlighting on his machine.  My machine as well as the CIDAR PC1 both detect and highlight the code accurately.  Therefore, something within the JSyntaxPane is acting up on Swapnil's machine.  Currently the module is set up to use the associated JSyntaxPane library, so I might try experimenting with just wrapping the most recent JAR instead.

I was working on my HTML scratchpad until Viktor, Chenkai, and myself had our meeting regarding the design of PuppetShow.
For now, I am to focus on implementing a feature that allows the user to import collections from their database connection.  I was told that AlgorithmManager already supports this, so that app will help with the proper integration techniques as well as help me familiarize myself with the Clotho API.  I am currently re-designing the GUI to provide easy-integration for several features that we have discussed and will be providing more information later on.

After considering all the feedback we received from experts in the field of wastewater treatment management, we decided that the point of implementation of Biotic Blue will be right before the biological stage.
Figure 5. Integration of Biotic Blue in the wastewater treatment process. (The top part of the illustration i.e. the main treatment process, is a redesign from Natuvardverket: Wastewater in Sweden 2016 [20])
Since radical changes in WWTP infrastructure are impractical and highly costly, implementation of Biotic Blue was designed to be compatible with the existing equipment and practices. More specifically, its implementation as an additional step before the flow of the sewage to the biological treatment, can be materialized by deploying in essence, an extra water tank, a magnet, a collection chamber and a pump. An integrated aeration system would need to be added to the water tank, which will bear the wastewater with the magnetic beads as well, in order to adequately secure mixing conditions. Therefore, with air bubbles spurt from the bottom of the tank, the possibilities for the enzyme-substance reactions to take place increase, and the precipitation of the magnetic beads is avoided. Besides, continuous supply of oxygen to the laccase is essential for its activity, and the aeration system provides it in a constant manner. The magnet that would be used needs to have elliptical shape and its strength needs to be sufficient to attract and separate the magnetic beads from water. It is important to highlight that the pipes bearing the wastewater along with the beads after the tank, would be Polyvinyl Chloride (PVC) pipes. Unlike steel and iron, materials commonly used for water pipes, PVC (plastic polymer) has low magnetic permeability and, therefore, does not have any magnetic shielding properties. Due to the strong ferromagnetic properties of the beads and the smart structure of the magnet and pipe setting, the beads separation process would be smooth and continuous, as it is illustrated in Figure 5. The collection chamber in which the magnetic beads will end up after their separation from the water, needs to have an inlet for the washing buffer used for the recovering of the enzymes before their re-use. Finally, the chamber will be connected with a pump transferring the recovered beads to the initial water tank. It must be highlighted that the proposed closed system is modular and it can function in fully automatic mode.
Comparative analysis
In the following Table 3 the advantages and disadvantages of Biotic Blue are presented"

Uppsala,2017,Team:Uppsala#HP#Gold Integrated_-_-_TEXT.html," up with a final decision. We have four potential projects. All of which seems realistic enough to be worked on. All of which seems to have caught interest of the team. So now it is time to take a peek at the ethical part of the problem. Thankfully, we have our 12 questions that we want to ask about a project before starting. You can read our ethical assessment of each project (after updating the questions during the project run). After talking about ethics our team had a democratic voting and concluded that Crafting Crocin was the project best suited for us to focus on.
But the ethical work is not over here, it's merely beginning. We needed to dig a bit deeper to make sure that we are going in the best possible way and treating the project responsibly. Before starting the project, we talked to experts in communicating science. Mirko Ancillotti and Stefan Eriksson gave us guidelines on how to speak about science and what language to use. We researched how to responsibly talk about science on the internet and social media. After which we decided to primarily use Facebook to contact the general public and talk about popular science and events. Instagram was used to communicate with other teams and share the spare of a moment adventures. Finally, we used LinkedIn to talk to professionals in the network. We also met with Heidi Howard, expert in legal, ethical and social aspects of consumer biology. She gave us tips and tricks on how to proceed with the project to the potential user. Next we also met lawyers from Uppsala Innovation Centre Per Kjellin and Olivia Tolan. They advise with projects like ours in the legal part. They helped us answer question about IPR rights and legal implications of the project. We talked about how it potentially would be unethical to not patent a product. This because then nobody would be able to develop it without any protection. However, after this project we decided to not patent our project as it would limit potential research use and our main reason for developing crocin was to make it available for researcher worldwide. This meeting gave us very useful advice on how to proceed in the future of not just our project but whole Uppsala iGEM in general.
If you read through our ethic endeavours you can see that we went deeper into talking ethics and iGEM. We asked not only the experts that shaped our project and its course from the beginning. We also asked iGEM community what they do and what they think about the questions we were asking. Upon that we were able to swing the course of some of our actions with these tips. While talking on the webinars we got plenty of tips"
UCAS-China,2018,Team:UCAS-China#Validated contribution_-_-_TEXT.html," two chromoprotein RBSs and genes under one promoter, we constructed six plasmids(BBa_K2598043, BBa_K2598044, BBa_K2598045, BBa_K2598046, BBa_K2598047, BBa_K2598048) to tandem express eforred, amilCP, amilGFP and fwYellow chromoproteins.
Figure 5. The color spectrum built from chromoproteins and their tandem expression products.
As shown in the figure 4, we built a color spectrum using chromoproteins and their tandem expression products, which can show orange, pink, yellow and green colors. Furthermore, we can see that the color of the tandem expression products, is always between the colors of the two chromoproteins in the spectrum. That is to say, by applying the physical principles, we can easily mix the color we want using tandem expression of chromoproteins.
Figure 6. The position of the color of GFP and the mixed color by the tandem expression of amilCP and amilGFP in the spectrum
What’s more, using the tandem expression of amilCP and amilCP, which are blue and yellow respectively, we mixed blue and yellow together to create green color, which rarely exist in colors of chromoproteins in iGEM registry. We use color picker and Photoshop to analyze and compare the color we got and that of amilGFP. The RGB value of our color is 184-209-108, while that of amilGFP is 178-191-138. That shows our color from the tandem expression is brighter and greener. Following the physical principles of mixing color and tandem expression rather than struggling to edit the molecular structure of the proteins, we provided a new approach to getting a new color with less cost of time and effort, which will largely enrich the part registry and generate more colors for scientific research and art creation.
Function of RGB system & Further Proof of concept
We performed simple verification of our concept using tandem expression and got well-fitted results, but the bacteria tandem express several chromoproteins can only have one color at a time, so we tried to use more convenient methods, for example light, to control and change the color of the bacteria. We decided to use the RGB system, which was introduced above, to achieve light-controlled color mix in bacteria, because light sensors on the cell membrane can response differently to the lights with different wavelengths, thus producing different outputs accordingly. By changing the wavelengths of the lights, we can control the response"

Collaboration on Media Analysis of gene technology related information  with NYMU-Taipei
Motivation with passion: Our team believe that media is the most efficient way to promote the knowledge and popularity of gene technology /synthetic biology(GTSB), not through sporadically independent advocate or educational activities .  Thus, we are curious and concerned about what gene technology related information in the media that the Taiwanese people are exposed to and whether the Taiwanese people can understand the information.  Thus, we told the NYMU-Taipei team about our idea to consult them.  NYMU-Taipei revealed their passion to iGEM and ambitiously suggested that we should do something for iGEM to support its influence on synthetic biology worldwide.
Goal: Thus, we decided to work together to conduct a large-scaled media analysis on the gene technology related information to make it as a significant project for GTSB.  In this way, using social study methods, we can provide solid and essential academic evidences that can be used in future design, plan, and implement science education in GTSB.  Thus, our goal is to investigate the media context on gene technology related information, and identify issues of the context.
Work on media analysis project: We analyzed the sufficiency and readability of media context on gene technology related information from magazines, newspapers and iGEM wiki.  We worked on defining the goal and scope of this project together.  NYMU-Taipei was in charge of establishing conceptual framework of our media analysis, designing survey sheets (codebook) based on the framework, and retrieving iGEM wiki; HSiTAIWAN is in charge of designing survey sheets(codebook), accomplishing data collection.  We analyze the data together and the results can be retrieved from the section of the Human Practice section on two teams.

Consider putting those into another strain (Y187) that does not have a gal1 promoter driven marker that would offer a selective advantage when kept turned on. Keep all of this in mind when we're making the stable transformants, maybe we'll have to generate those first and then put the plasmids back in (either Y190 or Y187).  I haven't done any literature searches yet to see if this can likely occur in the context of a 2-hybrid system or if this effect has been already observed in other regulated selectable marker systems that offer a metabolic/nutritional advantage. But it makes sense to me if you consider that 5-FOA is used as a negative selection compound to screen for randomly arising URA3 point mutants.

Color Model
Description
Approach
Assumptions
RGB components
Protein expression
Description
The eye's ability to separate two distinct colors depends on the hue, saturation and brightness of the observed color.
In this model, we want to design a procedure that take the desired image as input and the image needed to be project on the bacteria as output.
Approach
RGB is a convenient color model for computer graphics because the human visual system works in a way that is similar — though not quite identical — to an RGB color space.
We first find the RGB tristimulus values of the image. Then, it is possible to deduce corresponding fluorescent protein quantity that is needed to produce this visual effect. After that, Hill function was used to describe the relationship between gene expression output and light intensity input. While going through all these procedures, previous matrices that represent RGB values are transformed at each step. Finally, three transferred matrices were compound to one picture as output.
Assumptions
1. Emission peaks of three kinds of fluorescent proteins(red, green, blue) located closely to the primary wavelengths which form the three axes for RGB color space respectively. To be specific, the RGB color space created by the Commission Internationale de L'Eclairage defined monochromatic primaries the following wavelength: red----700.0 nm, green---546.1 nm, blue---435.8 nm. 2. From observation, the green light sensing system is much more sensitive to green light than the sensitivities of red and blue system to red and blue light. However, we can modify the green light response to make the three color systems coherent with each other. It has already be shown that in the CcaS-CcaR system, red light competitively inhibits activation by green light.  So growing under red light reduce the sensitivity of CcaS-CcaR to green light while preserving the full output range. Here, we assume that the only effect of an additional background illumination of red light is to reduce the sensitivities of green light without much interference to other members in this scenario. 3. The Cph8-OmpR and YF1-Fixj system are both light–intensity sensors"

1.HBUT-China & BNU-China
In our collaboration with HBUT-China, we helped them develop a mathematical model of the NcrB protein operon. Their corresponding page can be accessed here: Team:HBUT-China/Collaboration
BNU-China:modeling
Overview
Ni2+ is one of the heavy metal pollutants in our environment. In order to detect the concentration of the Ni2+, HBUT-China team are going to use the NcrB protein operon to achieve this goal. In this system, the nikABCDE gene will express the NikABCDE protein, which belongs to the ATP-binding cassette transporter. It can transport Ni2+ from the environment into the cell consuming ATP at the same time. And Ni2+ is the signal we need to detect. At the same time the ncrB gene will express NcrB protein, which is a repressor combining with the pncrA promoter, inhibiting the expression of the downstream gene luxCDABE. However Ni2+ will bind with the NcrB protein, causing the NcrB protein drop from the pncrA promoter. In this way, the luxCDABE gene will express. And the LuxCDABE protein can give out light by consuming energy in the cell. Thus we can detect the concentration of Ni2+ by measuring the luminescence intensity.
Hypothesis
1. The hypothesis on the diffusion equilibrium of Ni2+.
We assume that the ions distribute uniformly inside the cell immediately after they are transported into it through NikABCDE. As long as the speed of transportation is lower than the speed of diffusion, the ions are unlikely to aggregate around the transporter protein(e.g., NikABCDE). According to our knowledge, most of the transporter proteins do not possess such a high transporting efficiency, which means this hypothesis is valid in a larger degree"

As a result, a B-field of 1.43T and a magnetic flux density directly under the magnet tip of 588mT could be reached. But this flux density drops rapidly with the distance. The field gradient for a distance of 1mm amounts 27.08T/m and for a distance of 2cm, only 10.37T/m.  Because of this result we came to the idea of having many electromagnets under the petri glass in order to have a high gradient across the petri glass and consequently stronger magnetic forces over the whole area.  In order to have an idea of the speed the cells can reach, we follow the derivation of the paper of Martin Fusseneger but use as upper boundary, the field gradient simulated in the paper above for 1mm, meaning 27.08T/m.
The net force F_net acting on the the cells is given by the magnetic force F_mag caused by the magnetic field gradient ∇B minus the drag the force F_drag (Fussenegger):
Where ν stands fort the viscosity of the media (0.948mPas), R the Radius of the cell (9x10^-6m) and v the velocity of the cell.  Equating the magnetic and the dragging force, we obtain:
For a permenant magnet of 1.40 T and a magnetic field gradient of 150T/m, a minimum speed of 15*10^{-6}m/s is calculated.  For an electromagnet like the one on the paper of Dahmani with a magnetic field gradient of 10.37T/m at 2cm, which is much stronger than ours, we calculate a maximal speed of 6.48*10^{-6}m/s, less than half than with a permanent magnet. This is the maximum limit of speed we can expect with our home made electromagnets.

Marketing:
Our product would be the custom binding protein that specifically meets the customer’s wishes. We will focus on quality not quantity to satisfy our customer. The package would also include a detailed procedure with the basic steps, tips, tricks and possible modifications for further use and handling. The price will be affordable due to the main expenses being labor cost and the materials for purification. The contents of our product itself are cheap and produced by ourselves. We will distribute our product, the lyophilized binding protein, by mail order which provides a fast and efficient way. Advertising will mainly takes place on websites with scientific content in the field of microbiology and molecular biology as well as scientific journals or magazines. Because of this a rather small budget is needed and our product is presented specifically to subject related audience. This provides us a customer oriented and cost efficient form of marketing.
Organisation:
The management structure of our company will contain all necessary assignments while keeping it simple to avoid unnecessary costs.
Fig. :1 Managment Structure
We will mostly employ molecular biologists, biotechnologists and biotechnical assistants. The most advantageous location would be an enterprise zone because of good accessibility to highways and thus faster transportation.
Law:
For our laboratory we would need a safety level 1 laboratory which involves registration with the government, regularly controls and special equipment to ensure the safety of personnel, nature and humans. Aside from that no additional permit is necessary. We will call our company “Evobody Incorporated” which also indicates our legal form.
Finances:
Fig. :2 Profit calculation first year
Fig. :3 Profit calculation second year
Fig. :4 Profit calculation third year
The calculation shows that it is possible to make profit after 15 month. That is based on slowly rising orders. It is possible that we reach this point earlier or later depending on how fast our company gains public attention and thus more orders.
SWOT-analysis:
The strength of our product lies in its speed and customizability. The customer can specifically request his binder for a specific application. On the other hand our binder could also cover a wider range"

Sand brick produced by bacteria
Sporosarcina pasteurii --> urease
Calcium carbonate bricks can be made by using urease, urea, sand and calcium chloride. The urease cleaves the urea and creates ammonia and carbon dioxide. The ammonia raises the pH and causes the calcium ions to precipitate with the dissolved carbonate ions.
Ammonia is currently a problem since it can run off to cause algal bloom. A method to remove ammonia must be obtained. Solution? Possibly express all the urea cycle enzymes in the chassis (5 total enzymes). Use slovenia's DNA scaffold so that the process does not produce too many possibly problematic intermediaries in the bacteria.
When should ammonia be converted back to urea? When calcium is depleted. Need some sort of Calcium sensor.

TUST's iGEMer paid close attention to the health of these freshmen , so we followed them into the physical examination center and closely followed their health reports. In chatting with stomatologists, we found that people's oral problems are very serious nowadays: people in their 40s and 50s have tetracycline teeth problems, young people have oral problems caused by smoking, betel nut chewing, and teenagers have insect teeth problems. Doctors say tetracycline teeth are decreasing, but they are still very grim. Therefore, we also hope that through our HP activities we can call             attention to oral health, attention to antibiotic use, from the root cause of the formation of tetracycline teeth.

To test the interference of other nitrogenous substances in ammonium detection, we collected and analyzed water sample from local farming ponds. We found that NO3- is the main nitrogenous substance other than ammonium in pond water with a concentration of approximately 60uM. Therefore, we added potassium nitrate of different concentration into working medium with 0.02-fold of standard ammonium concentration and detected fluorescence intensity and OD600 of bacteria culture. Results showed that 100uM nitrate had slight influence on response of glnAp2 to ammonium concentration, suggesting that glnAp2 is suitable for ammonia detection in aquaculture water (Figure 8).
Selecting SsrA-like tags
Three SsrA-like tags (LAA, LVA and DAS) were added to the C-terminus of mRFP downstream the promoter glnAp2. By analyzing the dynamics of fluorescence intensity in working medium, we compared protein-degradation effects of these tags. We found that mRFP with LAA- and LVA-tag were unable to emit detectable fluorescence, indicating a high degradation rate, while mRFP with DAS-tag still produced red fluorescence, which in turn suggested the inefficiency of DAS-tag (Figure 9). In the meantime, the response time mRFP with DAS-tag reveals a remarkable difference, indicating a reliable resolution, while the LAA and LVA do not (Figure 10).
Demonstrating function of our sensor system
We constructed a sensor circuit where a reporter mRFP with a moderate-degradation DAS-tag was expressed from an NtrC-regulated promoter glnAp2, and tested its function in laboratory.
In laboratory, we used Cytation3 Multi-Mode reader to obtain the kinetic curves. Obviously, the degradation tag leads to a remarkable drop in the maximum RFU, which makes the fluorescence signal harder to be detected by normal photoresistors (fig.9). This problem can be solved by employed other photoelectric sensors with higher sensitivity, or we can give up the idea of involving degradation tag, as the circuits without this tag has displayed reliable performances.

Sydney_Australia,2016,Team:Sydney Australia#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html," is a substance that is permitted for use as a food additive by Standard 1.3.1 or as a processing aid by Standard 1.3.3.
Schedule 26 lists various permitted GMOS, including may herbicide-tolerant and insect-protected plant lines. GMOs are also permitted for use as food additives and, importantly, processing aids. Food additives perform some technological purpose in the final product, such as acting as a colouring or preservative. Processing aids perform a technological purpose at some point during the production process, but do not end up in the final product.
Certain enzymes of animal, plant and microbiological origin are permitted as processing aids, as listed in Schedule 18. Enzymes of microbiological origin that are permitted must be obtained from the specific organism listed. However, interestingly, ‘the sources listed in relation to enzymes of microbial origin may contain additional copies of genes from the same organism.’ With relevance to our project, our biosensor is clearly not listed as a permitted food additive or processing aid. However, perhaps it is neither. If it can be used as a device in the ripening facilities or shipping containers that never comes into contact with the fruit, then it would be neither food additive nor processing aid.In this context, it is necessary also to consider the potential for contamination, as there may be accidental contact between the biosensor and the fruit. Standard 1.6.1 details the regulations concerning microbiological limits in food, but this is mostly relevant for meats and dairy products which could be spoiled if the microbiological presence is too high. In any case, the design of our final product would need to reflect these concerns to either control for potential contaminationor, ideally, remove the risk through a cell-free system.
Microbe Card Game Project
One of our team members set out to design a card game that stylised various bacteria as little monsters. The card game was intended to be both educational and fun, introducing some of the more common bacteria that are involved in food and health to the wider community. To keep things simple, the game was going to have standard “top trumps” style rules, with categories like “pathogenicity” and “antibiotic resistance.” More complicated words would be bolded, with a reference list explaining these words in an educational way. Although the project was not completed, it remains an idea that will be pursued in the future. You can see some of the designs below.
We also created our own series of hand-sewn versions of our microbes! Doing so allowed us to engage with a younger audience in a way that was more specific"

CLSB-UK,2017,Team:CLSB-UK#HP#Gold Integrated_-_-_TEXT.html," the high risk group is greater than the general population. Therefore as more true positives would be picked up, the cost of unnecessary CT scans would be offset by the additional correct diagnoses. Everyone with a positive test result would have a CT scan anyway to confirm the presence of their cancer.
The major drawback to a low specificity is the psychological impact of a patient being told they have cancer when in fact they do not. Again, through using multiple miRNA signatures in tandem - i.e. the levels of different miRNAs related to a single disease, and calculating a weighted score involving all of them, so that an abnormal level of just one miRNA does not necessarily lead to a false positive.
We can also alleviate the problem of false positives by ensuring doctors tell patients that the results our sensor provides just indicate the need for further testing, and are not a diagnosis.
Dr Desai also advised that the result from our test could be combined with a score from patient history to quantify their risk (e.g. Tammegami et al.’s probability score). This total score would then be used to increase accuracy of the test.
NICE Criteria for screening tools
To incorporate the feedback from doctors into the applications of our project, we have explained how our sensor meets (or would be applied so that it meets) the NICE criteria for a screening tool.

Lung cancer is the most common cause of cancer-related mortality, with 1.6 million deaths worldwide in 2012. In the UK in 2014, there were 46,403 new cases and 35,895 deaths. [4] 80-85% of all lung cancers are NSCLC. [5]
The epidemiology, natural history and development of the condition from latent to declared states should be understood and/or there should be robust evidence about the association between the marker and the disease
Much is known about NSCLC, and although there are still a lot of research going into understanding cancer characteristics. The same is true for most other cancers. Although miRNAs are still being characterized, Hennessey et al. demonstrated a potential link between miR-15b and miR-27b to NSCLC. However, validation is still required with a large patient cohort for clinical use. Expert Dan Pregibon anticipates that the use of miRNAs as biomarkers is not far off.

For this reason a sucrose test was set up to see if the cells containing the Groningen plasmid from the plates had integrated the plasmid, consequently interrupting the sacA gene and so failing to metabolise sucrose and showing as more basic. For a positive control we used B.subtilis and sucrose (this was expected to be acidic) and our negative control was LB and sucrose (this was expected to be more basic as no metabolism). These cultures were left overnight. To see results please refer to July 17th .

Sucrose test
Aim and Method: Please refer to July 11th .
Results and Discussion: The sucrose test was carried out on the cultures using a PH meter. The results observed were as follows:
LB + sucrose + B.subtilis = 5.15
LB + B.subtilis = 6.77
LB + Groningen plasmid + sucrose = 4.23
LB + Groningen plasmid = 6.75
LB + sucrose = 7.07
These results show that cells with the Groningen plasmid had functional sucrase showing the plasmid has not been integrated so colonies must have been contaminants.
Transforming B.subtilis 168
Aim:
To transform B. subtilis with Groningen 2012 integration plasmid.
Methods:
Preparation for B.subtilis transformation was carried out; 5 ml of freshly prepared MM media was inoculated with B.subtilis 168 colonies to grow overnight. Also E.coli with Groningen plasmid was put in LB media and left to grow overnight. Protocol continued on July 18th .

In order to figure out the basic characteristic of k325909 submitted by Cambridge 2010, we measured growth curves of dH5a transformed k325909, which was induced by 0.3% arabinose (added from the very beginning of the incubation, and keep adding during the whole incubating process) under low temperature (25℃). As it shows in the chart, cells with and without induction grew to the logarithmic growth phase (about 5 hrs after inoculation) and stable phase (about 20 hrs after inoculation) were practically at the same time. But cells induced by arabinose displayed a significant decrease compared with those without induction.

Detection of the Modified Protein
Detection of the Modified Protein’s Expression
Expression of mRNA for our modified protein was detected through reverse transcription PCR. The gel demonstrates that no problem exists in the transcription of the coding sequence of the modified protein lov-HTH.
The result of SDS-PAGE gel displays a satisfying expression of the modified protein lov-HTH.
Figure2: rupturing Top10 (invitrogen) cells transformed modified protein coding sequence promoted by araBAD. Extract supernatant ran the SDS-PAGE gel with PageRuler™ Prestained Protein Ladder. The electrophoretic band lies on the 24kDa line confirms the expression of the modified protein.
Detection of the Modified Protein’s Function
The result of western-blot that we used to measure the expression of GFP in cells incubated under different conditions shows that the GFP expression of cells incubated under 450nm light (37℃) is about 30% lower than cells incubated in darkness.

- Mentoring HK_HCY_LFC team
This year, HKU team mentored HK_HCY_LFC, a joint team of two secondary schools, Tsuen Wan Public Ho Chuen Yiu Memorial College (HCY) and Po Leung Kuk Laws Foundation College (PLKLFC). Both schools are new to iGEM. Having alumni from both schools in the HKU iGEM team, the formation of the HK_HCY_LFC team was facilitated.
HK_HCY_LFC team chose to work on DNA nanostructure, an area HKU team was experienced in and was able to provide education and technical support. In early February, students from HKU iGEM team started to educate and brainstorm ideas with HK_HCY_LFC team students.
Training the new iGEMers
Starting from March, HKU team paid weekend visits to equip HK_HCY_LFC with synbio knowledge and skills, so that they would be ready to compete in iGEM using their own ideas.
With the kickstart of laboratory sessions in July, HKU team stepped up supervision on HK_HCY_LFC's experimental design and laboratory work. In day to day laboratory sessions, the HKU iGEM team members visited the school to teach students laboratory techniques, precautions and data analysis skills.
Supporting each other
HKU team helped HK_HCY_LFC with DNA nanostructure design advising, BioBricks cloning, InterLab study and preparation of the final submission plate.
HKU team would like to express our gratitude to HK_HCY_LFC, for helping us organize a part cloning demonstration at their school laboratory and giving us 3 pairs of primers to test the performance of ETHERNO.

Public Engagement
 
Our team is rooted on our passion for public engagement, and we believe that interacting with people outside of our team is essential to the spread of our research. Our journey to expand started this summer, where we went to the headquarters of Alzheimer’s Foundation of America (AFA) and Huntington’s Disease Society of America (HDSA) to present and learn about different brain diseases. We partnered up with the Cerebral Palsy Alliance Research Foundation to promote 10,000 daily steps to people of all ages in New York. From the educational aspects of it, we went on to meet the Columbia University Synthetic Biology Team and present to Stuyvesant High School. To act within the hospital rooms, we also attended the NYC HDSA Family Education Day at Columbia University Medical Center to chat directly with Huntington’s disease patients, their caregivers and public advocates. We find passion in such commitments, as our goal is to, not only conduct research, but to promote health and to raise awareness to the general public.

Background
Cardiovascular Diseases: the Protégés of Death
Caridovascular disease (CVD) is the No. 1 killer of human beings. On average, there are about 17.5 million people dying from CVD each year, which accounts for 31% of all deaths of human beings on Earth. Many more people are suffering from CVD or are at risk of developing it (Table 1).
 
Cardiovascular Diseases---the problem is serious. But how can we deal with it?
We can use tanshinone. One of the priorities of the WHO programme on Cardiovascular Diseases is the development of “cost effective and equitable health care innovations”. The health care for cardiovascular diseases includes various drugs, and tanshinone is one of the most important ingredients in multiple medicines for cardiovascular diseases, especially in China.
Tanshinone is a compound present in Salvia miltiorrhiza, a plant known as Danshen in China. Salvia miltiorrhiza has positive effects on ischemic diseases, which has been proved by various clinical trials (Sze et al, 2005). This may be the result of its active component, tanshinone, acting as an inhibitor of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE), hence leading to a decrease in blood pressure and blood clotting, as well as a dilation of arteries (Adams et al., 2006). An isomer of tanshinone, tanshinone II A, has been demonstrated to prevent atherogenesis, cardiac injuries and hypertrophy ("

Intro: Pondered how to express cage in iGEM compatible vector. Designed and ordered appropriate primers.
Vinson had a plasmid that contains: T7 promoter-RBS-iGEM suffix. After much thought, I designed primers to amplify our g block with the iGEM prefix, and tack on a his tag, stop codon, and the suffix in two rounds of PCR. The forward primer will be the iGEM prefix and the first 20 nucleotides of the cage sequence. The first reverse primer will be the last 20 nucleotides of the cage and the his tag. The second reverse primer will inclund the final nucleotide of the cage, his tag, stop codin and suffix. This two step addition was the only way to add the his tag and stop codon without going over the 60bp limit imposed by IDT for ordering oligos. Sri said to express the cage in this new iGEM compatible vector, as well as the pET-22b vector in parallel, just to see which is better. He recommended that we initially transform the ligated plasmids into DHSalpha competent cells (in his lab) to verify correct plasmids before finally transforming them into BL21-DE3 competent cells for protein expression.

Introduction:  Cells will be harvested, and cell lysis will be done if reagents are available.
Procedures:
Harvesting of cells: The 2L flask was taken out of the 30C incubator at 12:00PM, and left on the bench for about 2.5 hours.  The cells appeared to be dense, as indicated by the milky-yellow color of the culture.  Four 250mL centrifuge bottles were autoclaved, along with 1L of ddH2O.

TUDelft,2018,Team:TUDelft#HumanPractices#EducationandEngagement_-_-_TEXT.html," comparing it to the natural unfairness inherent to gene distribution. In China 13% believes gene doping can make sports fairer. In The Netherlands 11.2% thinks the same, which is what we expected.
We thought that people think gene doping should also be accessible to athletes to avoid large discrepancies between athletes and the rest of society.
In The Netherlands however, 66.5% thinks gene doping in sports should then still stay prohibited. Thus, most likely our detection method will have a market for many years to come.
Reducing survey response effects
Firstly, we were aware of a threat for endorsement effects. Endorsement effects are effects of expected preference that influence the respondents. Of course we explain who we are and that we are developing a detection method for gene doping. Nevertheless, during the discussions we actively kept an open mind on the topic and challenged people to think out of the box, adopting a neutral position ourselves by challenging the future of our method. We would not elaborate on our personal opinions before handing out the survey. On top of this, we hoped to circumvent any reference effects by having fully anonymous surveys that did not ask for any classification that could be associated with answer preferences. Then there often is the problem of question order effects, which we addressed by rephrasing several questions at different points of the survey. In the athlete survey we on top of this evaded the word “doping” to circumvent any bias that is directly inherent to this word. Instead we used words as genetic alterations and gene editing, which generally have less strong negative feelings attached to them.
The trains and public transport locations were chosen to reduce nonresponses and to have a highly representative population. Subsequently, we started off our surveys with several clear hypotheses and had 181 respondents in the Netherlands and 126 respondents in China.

National and International Publicity
When it comes to publicity, we started out small, reaching out to the media channels related to our University. Soon however, we were picked up by National and International news sites that stretched till the UK, Canada and beyond. One afternoon, we were googling our project and found that we even had been cited by media without our knowledge. This shows the extend to which our impact reached.

Tasty-Style Videos
Taking inspiration from Buzzfeed’s Tasty videos, our team created an instructional video describing how to properly execute a serial dilution. In the video, we carefully went through the process and proper lab techniques needed when conducting a serial dilution. After filming and editing the video, we posted it to Youtube to expand the educational potential of our video. We proposed the idea of a “Tasty-style” video to other iGEM teams, and iGEM Peshawar 2017, UNBC iGEM, and TNCR Korea created videos documenting the lab techniques of transformations, agarose gels, and ligation prep. Our intention in creating these videos is to teach viewers about common lab techniques in a simple and engaging way to aid them in their scientific endeavors.
CloneCademy & Collaboration with TU Darmstadt
Under the instruction of the TU Darmstadt iGEM team, our team contributed to the educational program of CloneCademy. CloneCademy is a series of learning modules with the purpose of teaching readers about biology and related fields, including biotechnology and the ethics of scientific research. Our team sent our tasty-style video playlist to TU Darmstadt so their team would be able to incorporate our lab-technique videos into their teaching program.
Mini iGEM Convention
On August 4-5th, we collaborated with the Gaston Day School team to host the Southeastern iGEM Mini Convention for iGEM teams geographically close to us. Although there were not as many teams present as we would have hoped for (just Gaston and Duke), this event gave each of us the opportunity to get closer with all teams and focus our time and energy into giving thorough and in-depth feedback and analysis on each other’s projects. We were in charge of contacting guest speakers in the Biological Engineering field who would be willing to give a lecture on the emerging and flourishing field of synthetic biology, including its ethical implications. After sending out over a 100 emails, we finally got positive responses, thus finalizing the schedule for the first day of the convention.
The following speakers were in attendance:

TU-Munich,2013,Team:TU-Munich#HumanPractice#Interviews_-_-_TEXT.html," question differed, also the point of view concerning to the worldwide water problem, scarcity and the definition of common water diverged. In his speech, R. Ardakanian placed water in context with waste. He said that waste can be a resource for the production of food and energy and must contribute as recycled waste in technology. According to E. Adar the goal and challenge for the next generation is (Ben Gurion University, Negev, Israel) minimizing the water use and costs. To him it was evident that water is a synonym for food and a commodity, not a resource like gold.
Figure 3: speech about ""historic and future variations in global water"" from J. Sheffield
Furthermore M. Lange (The Cyprus Institute, Nicosia) presented his speech titled ""Ways about Climate Change and Energy-Water Nexus in the Mediterranean"". A. Porporato (Duke University, NC, USA) gave a lecture on the role of ecohydrological variability in productivity and sustainability of ecosystems.
The following general speeches about the water scarcity and climate change, informed the audience about different present projects to reduce the water scarcity. G. Teutsch (UFZ Leipzig) who opened the conference talked about a “quick start” to reduce the water scarcity, which sticks together with the urgent topic of climate change. The main statement of the second speaker's speech ,P. Krebs (TU Dresden), was that not visions yield viable results, but only excellent concepts, new projects and community action. That the water topic has also an important role in politics, was approached from F. Holzwarth, (BMU Bonn) whose goal is forming a “water alliance with new individual faces”. He stated that in contrast to the climate change, the water scarcity isn’t a major topic in politics, because “disasters drive politics”.  In his speech U. Weber (DFG Bonn) picked out science (project, implementation and ideas) and society (public, politic) in relation to water scarcity and climate change  as central themes. In turn, J. Sheffield (Princeton University, USA; see Figure 3) broached the issues of the transition between drought and floods.

Trevor! suggested sequencing the DNA from the actual transformation kit. Will run gels/PCR cleanup tomorrow.
DAY 3 Mini prep the overnight liquid cultures if the sequences are correct.
Get the linearized pSB1c3 backbone by doing PCR on the pabA+B minipreps. Use purple 1.5 mL ""pSB1c3 backbone"" primers in the box. Run PCR cleanup.
Gibson Assembly with pabC (with Gibson ends) and linearized pSB1c3 backbone and transform into 5-alpha.
NOTE: PCR tubes ""p1 and p2"" and ""g1 and g2"" are unknown ???? One set is the amplified pabC with ends for gibson. So try gibsoning with both, but if you're not feelin it - try g1 and g2 tubes and we can troubleshoot from there. Both pairs of tubes should be in the box.
DAY 4 If Gibson fails and we can't successfully determine which PCR tubes contain the pabC with Gibson ends, then we have to remake it.
PCR the 1.5 mL tubes of pabC labeled ""p2"" and ""p4"". The primers for this PCR are labeled ""pabC Gibson primer fwd/rev"".
Alternative DAY 4 If Gibson's successful!!!
Do colony PCR and sequence (using VF2, VR or the pSB1c3 BB primers in the box). Run gel, do PCR cleanup.
Make liquid cultures of colonies with the right size (~2k bp)
