Our Advisors
Luna Eresta JAYA, Luna
The Good Teacher.
Luna taught us a lot of useful wet lab skills on our lab training                             tutorial. She often makes sure our team know where we are focusing and will guide us to the right                             direction. Especially for human practices, she always gives amazing advice to modify our plans.
Ka Man TAM, Sabrina
One of our best advisors that we are pleased to have.
She has taught us so many                             things in the lab and also in theory. She gives us advice from the very beginning of the project                             throughout the whole journey. Her advice on the project design and troubleshooting helps us to                             make our project better.
Tze Wing MAK, Tiffany
Our IT backup.
Tiffany knows well the importance of the wiki page. She gave us                             a lot of useful tips and helped us tackling technical problems. She appears to be very serious,                             but once she warms up, she has a pretty silly side too. She likes to call the iGEM girls ""Dua                             eng"" (which means ""sweetheart"" in Thai)

SJTU-BioX-Shanghai,2012,Team:SJTU-BioX-Shanghai#Project#project2.2_-_-_TEXT.html," products diversity.
Cluster of FabG, FabI and FabZ provides C16- and C18 specific TesA with sufficient amount of fatty acyl-ACP to hydrolyze and release. Therefore, we witnessed a tremendous growth in the turnover of fatty acids with C16 and C18 skeleton in the supernatant.(Fig.11 A)
Moreover, fatty acid with C14 skeleton was first detected in E.coli expressing membrane anchored enzymes compared with ones with free enzymes. It is probably because the high productivity of membrane anchored TesA quickly released free fatty acid. Monounsaturated fatty acids also emerge in considerable amount for the first time since TesA is located so closely to the cluster of FabG, FabI and FabZ that it catches intermediate with C16 and C18 skeleton even before they are reduced.(Fig.11 C)
Augment in both diversity and amount of fatty acids led to 24 fold increase in total fatty acid yield compared with wild type and 9 fold compared with E.coli expressing diffusing cytoplasmic enzymes. (Fig.11 B) The exciting result convincingly proves that membrane scaffold enhances protein interaction and cluster of enzymes makes reaction faster to a surprising extent. Products accumulated near inner membrane can traval a shorter distance to be exported to membrane.
Fig.12 shows fatty acid content in sediment of three groups to evaluate the advantages of Membrane Accelerator. A indicates C16/C18 fatty acids content. B stands for the total amount of fatty acids.
The fatty acids yields increase in sediment is relevantly moderate. The reason might be that membrane anchored enzymes facilitate exportation of large quantity of fatty acids so the amount of fatty acid remaining in cytoplasm is limited. It is notable that C19 fatty acids only exist in cytoplasm because large molecular weight of C19 fatty acid prevents it from exportation and finally they are trapped in the cell. C19 fatty acids yield in Membrane Accelerator Group is even less than Group with diffusing cytoplasmic enzymes. We suppose it is caused by the high efficiency of TesA which leads to quick release of free fatty acid.
Future Direction
Fig.13 Cyanobacteria under light microscope
We haven't optimized experiment conditions with respect to strains, growth media, temperature etc., but the result has proved that Membrane Accelerator could accelerate biosynthetic pathway in E.coli marvelously. Moreover, changing the proportion of different enzymes in each enzyme assembly on membrane would promisingly enhance biosynthesis rate even more. In the near future, we expected to optimize those conditions to further improve the efficiency of Membrane Accelerator.

Neochr - New Chromosome Designer
The Neochr module contains three plugins: Decouple, Add and delete.
Neochr module uses public data from Saccharomyces Genome Database, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes , E.coli genome project , Virulence Factors of Pathogenic Bacteria .
NucleoMod - Nucleotide Sequence Modifier
When we extract gene from wild type genome to create a new chromosome, We need to silence the original wild type gene. The NucleoMod module can design CRISPR site to reach this goal.And the module can optimize the codon to increase expression level of genes.
SegmMan - Split for Assembly
The synthesizer or synthesis chip can up to 3kb DNA sequence with high accuracy, but chromosome is not that short.
SegmMan can settle this problem, it splits chromosome into 30k fragments, after parsing its exited enzyme sites, continues segmentation into 10k and 2k fragments. In 10k and 2k level, its will add vector homologous region and design enzyme sites.
OLS(Oligo library synthesis) Designer
For the users who synthesize DNA in chip can utilize OLS(Oligo library synthesis) Designer to design oligos and enzyme sites, primers to assemble 500-800 fragments.
(a) Pre-designed oligonucleotides (no distinction is made between dsDNA and ssDNA in the figure) are synthesized on a DNA microchip.
(b) cleaved to make a pool of oligo nucleotides.
(c) Plate-specific primer sequences (yellow or brown) are used to amplify separate plate subpools (only two areshown), which contain DNA to assemble different genes(only three are shown for each plate subpool).
(d) Assembly-specific sequences (shades of blue) are used to amplify assembly subpools that contain only the DNA required to make a single gene.
(e) The primer sequences are cleaved using either type IIS restriction enzymes (resulting in dsDNA) or by DpnII/USER/λ exonuclease processing (producing ssDNA).
(f) Construction primers(shown as white and black sites flanking the"

As a part of our Statewide outreach initiatives we wanted to connect with teachers and introduce them to new ways of teaching synthetic biology. With the support of a NASA Mini-Proposal we created a 10 subject course taught through William & Mary which engaged students by relating topics in synthetic biology to long term space travel and NASA. The descriptions for each lesson can be downloaded here . The 10 subjects include:
Introduction to Mars
Synthetic Biology Techniques & Tool Kit
Utilizing a Closed System
Food on Mars
Waste Management
Fuel
Water Reclamation and Recycling
Diagnostic Tools & Ready Medicine
Gas Exchange
Shelter
The use of long term space travel generated a lot of excitement in our high school summer students who worked with us over the summer, and allowed us to explore up and coming bioengineering projects. The course provides teacher with advanced synthetic biology instruction while simultaneously conducting in classroom activities which connect to the Virginia Science Standards of Learning.
Upon completion of this course teachers will receive credit toward their Virginia State Teacher Licence which must be renewed every five years.
This course will give teachers the background knowledge and lesson suggestions for the successful implementation of new synthetic biology research into their classrooms. The program varies in the complexity of the lessons depending on grade level. The higher level lessons include completing a series of wet lab experiments. These experiments help students develop a proficiency in bioengineering techniques, however, they require access to a lab, equipment, and reagents not always available at schools. To reduce these barriers we began a partnership with Thermofisher Scientific which will help improve student access to hands on activities related to synthetic biology. That part of our outreach initiative can be found here .
Registration for this course opens in November for teachers in the Williamsburg-James City County School District.
The original mini-proposal can be found here

Detection of Bcr-Abl using our Cas12a assay
Figure 13. Representation of the translocation experiment. Comparison of samples with the mutated gene, Bcr-Abl, versus the negative controls, Bcr and Abl.
Our aim is to be able to differentiate between a sample with the targeted mutated sequence, Bcr-Abl, and the healthy equivalents, Bcr and Abl separately. (Figure 13)
Here are the results we obtained amplifying the DNA templates in plasma at 10pM in the PCR.
Figure 14. PCR amplification (30 cycles) in plasma with generuler 1kb plus ladder.
Lane 1: Although faint, we can still distinguish a band corresponding to the mutated Bcr-Abl gene of 105 bp.
Lane 2: Bcr gene on its own acts as a negative control as only one of the primer binds to it. We indeed cannot see any band.
Lane 3: Abl, like Bcr, acts as a negative control. We also cannot see any band.
Lane 4: This negative control does not contain any template DNA.
The gel results are good although not as bright as expected for 30 amplification cycles. We suspect that the loading dye, used at a high concentration, is generating the whitened area above our band making it difficult to see the results.
Figure 15. Cas12a detection fluorescence (4 replicates) after 250 minutes using as template PCR amplicon performed from plasma. Background-subtracted. The negative control contains DnaseAlert, Cas12a, its gRNA and the negative                           control of the PCR (only primers). Positive control contains DNaseAlert in addition to Dnase I.
Here we can see that the Cas12a is highly activated by our amplified Bcr-Abl gene. The signal is about 7 times higher in the mutated gene sample than in the sample containing Bcr or Abl. It implies that the amplification step worked                       and did add the required PAM sequence for Cas12a activation.
Conclusions
Our goal was to be able to distinguish samples which contained our chromosomal rearrangement compared to the ones whose nucleic acid sequences originate from a healthy genome. We succeeded in differentiating them after amplification                       in plasma.

For this purpose a student team member did the sample preparation, calculated the theoretical mass using the AutoAnnotator and brought the samples to Andreas Reichert who is a doctoral student at the chair and is responsible for the ESI-TOF mass spectrometer. He measured the samples together with a student team member and showed us the deconvolution of the primary data.
Fluorescense Microscopy
All fluorescense microscopy experiments were performed at the Chair for Plant Developmental Biology (Prof. Dr. Schneitz) as plants (and especially P. patens) exhibit a strong autofluorescence caused by the photosystem. Therefore an advanced microscope with appropriate filters is absolutely necessary which we could use at the Chair for Plant Developmental Biology. The experiments were performed by our student member Dong-Jiunn Jeffery Truong who has worked during his bachelor thesis with fluorescense microscopy over several weeks and was therefore an essential experimentator for this part of the project. An introduction to the microscopes was given by Dr. Prasad Vaddepalli.
Transformation of Physcomitrella patens
The transformation of Physcomitrella patens was one of the main concerns when we thought about working with Physcomitrella as it might cause some trouble which can only be handled by using the appropriate equipment and the advises of an experienced researcher. Therefore we contacted Prof. Dr. Reski (Freiburg University, 350 km distance) in May and could win him as an advisor for our team. After traveling several times to Freiburg we could perform the transformations in his lab. For this purpose we brought all buffers and the sterile linearized DNA from Munich and performed the transformation under the instructions of Dr. Gertrud Wiedemann. All steps of the transformation were conducted by student team members as it can be seen in our Transformation Results section.

TEAM
Collaboration
As one of the 254 teams that have joined the big family of iGEM, we are trying our best to meet new friends and offer help to those who are in need. That is one thing that makes this competition interesting and beautiful, it not all about competing, but also about communicating and collaborating.
Collaboration with Tsinghua-A
Assisted Tsinghua-A in preparing their parts for submission
Mutual sharing of lab resources (enzymes/flow cytometer)
Constant communication on iGEM news and requirements
Held joint seminar on iGEM for Tsinghua Undergrads
We have been in close collaboration with another team from our home university, Tsinghua-A . They are excellent team and are doing amazing work. We feel very happy that we were able to give them hands on their experiment and part submission. It was also quite exciting when we were holding a mini-symposium together for students in our school. We talked about our projects and also tried to present the beauty of synthetic biology to junior students.
Collaboration with NUDT-China
We sent 8 of our parts from our team DNA repository to NUDT-China team to help them start their experiments. Some of these parts were created by Team Tsinghua for iGEM 2013 and others were from the DNA distribution kit from 2013.
Collaboration with BNU-China
Provided consultation when BNU-China started their first team
Our team has been participating in iGEM for the past five years and much experience has been passed down from one generation to another. As such an experienced team, we are very willing to help out those new teams which probably join the iGEM for the first time this year. This is what we did for the team from Beijing Normal University ( BNU-China ). They are a team of rising stars and are willing to take initiative. We are very happy to be able to help. The two teams scheduled several meetings and we were having a wonderful time.
Communication with Other Teams
"
NYMU-Taipei,2017,Team:NYMU-Taipei#Nitrogen starvation_-_-_TEXT.html," we can see that the lactose concentration and the degree of decline of OD value are positively correlated.
We also collaborate with team TAS Taipei. They helped us testing our holin-endolysin-NrtA construct.
As the figure shows, the trend of the relative absorbance is downward as the lactose is added to induce the suicide mechanism. The concentration of lactose is also positively correlated with the declining degree of the relative absorbance.
We need to mention that there are some differences in the process of team TAS Taipei and our functional tests. We used different medium to cultivate the bacteria. For the bacteria with holin-endolysin construct, we used Luria-Bertani (LB) broth with 0.9% glucose to cultivate; team TAS Taipei cultivates the bacteria with holin-endolysin-NrtA construct with only Luria-Bertani (LB) broth. According to our previous experimental results, the bacterium doesn't seem to grow well in only LB broth medium. Therefore, to make the figure look similar, team TAS Taipei normalized their data (absorbance at 0 hour is the background). Despite the culture medium difference, the results both show that our suicide mechanism can work. (see more detail about collaboration)

The lane with primers only did not yield any band, which suggests the non-specific band is not a primer-dimer.  Upon referring back to the hetero-dimer analysis from IDT, there are a few candidate hetero-dimers that fit the observed size, but nothing conclusively indicates what it is.
Gel Extraction: Danny suggested to try a gel extraction since only a small amount will be needed.  This was done with Nithin (see his notes).
Conclusions:
Tomorrow will be used to PCR the iGEM suffix into the construct, as well as plan for the downstream ligation reactions, and transformation.

In addition to the supplements, the appropiate antibiotics have to be added into the medium. Final concentrations should be choosen according the stock concentrations proposed by addgene. A blank for the OD600 measurements should be taken before connecting the medium to the tubings.
After connecting the media line of the turbidostat to the medium container, the turbidostat should be filled with medium until a volume of 1.5 l is reached, by starting the media pump.
50 ml bacterial culture resulting from the *MP testing* should be used for inoculation. Therefore draw up the culture into a syringe and inoculate the turbidostat using a cannula through the septa in the turbidostat. Reduce the flow rate to a minimum to ensure an efficient growth of the culture in the turbidostat.
lagoon pump can be started when the turbidostat reaches an OD600 = 0.6 - 1.0. The lagoon volume can be adjusted at a range of 100 - 150 ml lagoon volume.
induce mutagenesis by start adding 10% w/v arabinose to the lagoon. Arabinose should be added at last one hour before infection with bacteriophages to secure the induction of the MPs
When the lagoon is ready, arabinose is added and the cells are on a constant optical density, the lagoon can be infected with bacteriophages. Add 1 ml of 1010 PFU/ml to the lagoon and start the existing PACE run
During the PACE run, samples should be taken every four hours for the first 24 hours and every eight hours from the second day on until the run is finished. Also, phage detection PCRs and plaque assays should be implemented, proving the presence of the phage of interest and a contamination free turbidostat. Positive and negative control always have to be included into the detection PCR as well as the plaque assays.
Results – evolving split T7 polymerase toward improved auto-reassembly

Li is majorly concerned about the biosafety of our design and we also think it is a key point on whether our product can be sold on the market or not. Let’s pay more attention on safety of our device!
Contact with fish farmers
To make our project and device have practical meaning, we contacted with different fish farmers and presented our project and device to them. Thanks to their feedback, we had better understanding about what fish farmers actually concerned about. In addition, we also found that most of the farmers are lack of basic scientific knowledge to deal with outbreak of fish diseased and ammonia nitrogen. This inspired us to put some effort on publicizing scientific knowledge among fish farmers.
Crab Farmers
Yancheng, Jiangsu Provice, China
Crab is one of the fresh water creatures that are extremely sensitive to water quality and to be specific, ammonia concentration. Therefore, we interviewed some crabs farmers to see what they think about our project.
Key point
Individual farmers lack of cultivation knowledge, so factory farming is not implemented on a large scale.
Experience still plays an important role in assessing pond water quality.
As for the pond water detection, online equipment is expensive while offline kits are complex and abstruse.
According to our communication with the crab farmers, we feet it important to design a product that farmers without much knowledge can use easily. Let’s make a convenient, cheap online device to help the farmers!
Sturgeon Farmers
Beijing, China
Since it is important to and learn about their opinions about ammonia pollution in ponds, we contacted with several farmers in Beijing, paid visits to their ponds and had face-to-face talks with farmers to get more information.
Key point
Fish farmers themselves do not care about biosafety, they only care about how customers think about their aquatic product.
Changing water is an efficient but expensive way to improve the water quality, only big companies can afford 200 thousand yuan per month on changing water.
Our project should aim at self-employed fish ponds instead of those big aquaculture companies.
Good water quality does make fish more tasty and fish can be sold for a higher price as long as the fish tastes good.

PCR-touchdown
How to do ""touchdown-PCR""
Touchdown-PCR is a way to increase the concentration of specific product by using a higher than optimal annealing temperature and then lower the annealing temperature by and negative increment in temperature each cycle. After a couple of these cycles the reaction should contain more specific product and therefore the additional cycles can be run on the optimal annealing temperature without getting any unspecific product. Below is an example of how a touchdowm-PCR can look:
98°C for 2:00 - Denaturing and warm up
98°C for 0:10 - Denaturing after each cycle
65°C for 0:30 - Annealing
Temperature increment of -0.5°C/cycle
72°C for 2:00 - Elongation
Go to number 2 - repeat 10 times
98°C for 0:10 - Denaturing after each cycle
55°C for 0:30 - Annealing
72°C for 2:00 - Elongation
Go to number 7 - repeat 30 times
72°C for 5:00 - Final extension

Bielefeld-Germany,2012,Team:Bielefeld-Germany#Labjournal_-_-_TEXT.html," hormones. From the beginning our aim was not to detect but to degrade hormones. We found several possible ways for degradation as there are the hydrolysis of estradiol-derivates with sufatases and glucoronidases. But we thought the best way to degrade steroid hormones would be with the use of laccases. Laccases have the ability to radicalize aromatic rings and can therefore be used to degrade or polymerize a broad range of substances, such as steroid hormones, special insecticides, polycyclic aromatic carbohydrates and aromatic acids. In nature laccases are often used for degradation or polymerisation of lignin or pigments.
Molding together to a team
After we found our project idea we decided to have a get-to-know-weekend with some presentations about iGEM, important methods and ideas for human practices. We also held presentations about other possible iGEM projects to extend our horizon, as there were: e.g. RNA aptamers  and magnetotactic bacteria. But the most important part of this weekend was the growing as a team. We realized that we all had one summer to work together, have fun together and most important to stand up together as a team.
Find the right one for the right job
Now it was time to organize the work and find a suitable task for everyone. In a developing team a lot of different jobs have to be done, e.g.:
finding sponsors
communication with the public
human practices
wiki- and homepage-design
modelling
a forum for exchange of information
a joker, who entertains the team and lifts the mood
And finally lab work began, feel free to follow us in our weekly labjournal and have a look how our labwork, results and of course problems and their solutions, evolved.

Consequences of our dependence on fossil fuels
The human race has become highly dependent on fossil fuels to meet its energy needs.  In particular, global transportation infrastructures are built around vehicles that require petroleum derived liquid fuels. Unfortunately, because petroleum is a limiting resource and predicted to become scarce in the coming decades (Shafiee, S., and Topal, E. (2009). Policy 37, 181-189), our dependence on this resource is clearly not sustainable. The solutions to this problem are to either develop an alternative that can function as a direct replacement for petroleum as liquid fuel production or to invent modes of transportation that don’t require liquid fuel. While efforts for the latter alternative are emerging in the development of electric vehicles; efforts to address this problem in the near term will likely focus on the development of alternative liquid fuels.  In addition to the economic consequences described above, the world is also experiencing drastic global climatic changes that can be traced back to our heavy consumption of fossil fuels.  The increase in “greenhouse” gas emissions resulting from the combustion of fossil fuels has led to unprecedented increases in the Earth’s surface temperature (Mitchell, J.F.B. (1989).Rev Geophys 27, 115-139). Researchers forecast the occurrence of catastrophic events including rising sea levels, disease pandemics, crop failure and loss of biodiversity if these practices continue (Hughes, L. (2000) Trends in Ecology & Evolution 15, 56-61). World governments are prescribing policies to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions by curbing fossil fuel consumption."
TMMU_China,2016,Team:TMMU China#HP#Gold_-_-_TEXT.html," was hosted by Sun Yat-sen University, in order to simulate the iGEM Giant jamboree and enhance further communication among different teams. This was a great opportunity to present our work and learn from the other 28 teams. It was nice to see that we did a good job in presentation and the audience was attracted by our project. The most important thing to us was that we harvested much useful advice from the judges, mentors and students. Interestingly, we were lucky to have dinner with two former iGEMers Zhang Haoqian and Liu Yang, who encouraged us to go deeper in research and promote iGEM and synthetic biology research in our university. From the CCiC, we were aware of our current disadvantages in quantitative measurement and the overall logic, which laid a foundation for the later adjustments and improvements.
TMMU-China Meet-up:After several attendances of meet-ups, we hold a meeting one month before the opening ceremony. Although small in scale, this meet-up aimed at further promoting projects and better preparing for the whole competition. It is worth mentioning that with only one month from the competition, many teams felt they were under great pressure. Professor Rao Xiancai from TMMU-China shared with us his story. He told us that with the advent of the information age, acquiring knowledge and exchanging information had become much easier than decades ago, with iGEM as a good example of integration of network information and international communication. The whole world is enjoying a golden age of information exchange and multilateral communication. He hoped that given the chance, all the young adults could seize the moment to learn more, not for medals or awards, but to stand on the frontier of the age, and by working together, we would make a difference. Professor Rao’s speech inspired us all and we therefore deepened our understandings of scientific research. At last, the exciting hot pot dinner lighted up the happy atmosphere for every team member to enjoy the meeting and refresh for future challenges.

This page is used by the judges to evaluate your team for the Best Supporting Entrepreneurship award .
Delete this box in order to be evaluated for this medal. See more information at Instructions for Pages for awards .
Entrepreneurship
In previous years, iGEM had an entrepreneurship track. Teams were encouraged to build projects and focus around commercializing their work. We have now moved to an award as the best work in this area may come from teams who are not solely focused on entrepreneurship.
The Best Supporting Entrepreneurship award recognizes exceptional effort to build a business case and commercialize an iGEM project. This award is open to all teams to show that entrepreneurship is something all teams can aspire to do with their project. This award can go to an new project, or to a previous project that a team aimed to commercialize. Have you filed a provisional patent on your project/device/process? Have you raised money to build and ship products? Have you pitched your idea to investors and received money? Complete the entrepreneurship section on the 2016 Judging form and tell us what you did. As always in iGEM, the aim is to impress the judges!
Inspiration
You can look at what other teams did to get some inspiration!
Here are a few examples:

DTU-Denmark,2010,Team:DTU-Denmark#SPL_-_-_TEXT.html," PCR programs.
After PCR is completed, a PCR purification should be performed using a PCR clean up kit (e.g. Macherey-Nagel – NucleoSpin Extract II).
The BioBrick plasmid backbone should now contain the SPL and is ready to be used as a vector in a BioBrick assembly.
Advantages of Using the DTU SPL Standard
An SPL allows the fine tuning of gene expression by creating a promoter library with a wide variety of strengths. For data from our SPL proof of concept experiments, please visit our SPL Results page
The SPL will necessarily give you the allowed upper and lower bounds of gene expression for cell viability.
The method for creating the BioBrick compatible SPL is quick and easy to perform. The method is practically identical to the procedure for generating linear BioBrick plasmid backbones, which many teams will most likely have to do anyway.
Once the SPL is in the linear BioBrick plasmid backbone, it can be used in a variety of experiments. A BioBrick part or device can be ligated into the plasmid backbone and the resulting ligation can be transformed and screened for colonies containing the promoter strength needed.

It should mention that the last term<math>-kx_{i}</math> represents the degradation of <math>x_{i},</math> which seems to belong to <math>f_{i}(x_{i})</math> that may render degradation term undermined, we should add such a term for its ubiqutious existence in biological systems.
It is illustrative to consider the network generation task using a compact mathematical framework. Especially for metabolic networks, the structural and kinetic information can be well summarized using a time variant concentration vector <math>\mathbf{x}</math>, a time invariant stoichimetric matrix <math>S</math> , and a time variant reaction rate vector <math>\mathbf{v}</math>. Vector <math>v</math> contains concentrations for all the <math>k</math> species <math>(x_{k},k=1,...,n)</math>. The <math>n\times m</math> matrix <math>S</math> represents the network structure by storing stoichiometric coefficients of all n reactions in its columns. The element <math>S(i,j)>0</math> if reaction <math>j</math> produces species <math>i</math>, <math>S(i,j)<0</math> if reaction <math>j</math> consumes species <math>i</math>, and otherwise <math>S(i,j)=0</math>. The reaction rate vector <math>\mathbf{v}</math> describes reaction rates <math>v_{j}</math>, <math>j=1,...,n</math>. Reaction rates vary according to kinetic laws which are linear or nonlinear algebraic functions.
Typically, kinetic laws determine the rates based on the amounts of species participating to reactions as well as various reaction specific parameters. Altogether, an ODE model can be formulated as
<math>\begin{align} \frac{d\mathbf{x}}{dt}=S\mathbf{v} \\ \end{align}\,\!</math>
The reaction rates <math>v_{j}</math>, <math>j=1,...,m</math> are determined by kinetic laws <math>f_{j} </math> as

WashU_StLouis,2018,Team:WashU StLouis#Future Directions_-_-_TEXT.html," avirulence factors are studied, the concepts of our project and our device can be expanded to other common resistance genes.
Though our human practices work, we have found that many small-scale farmers in developing nations are unaware of the specific resistance proteins that are present in their line of wheat. They continue to use the same stock of seeds that lack newly developed resistance genes, making their crops susceptible to almost every race of Pgt, given the recently high mutation rate. Therefore, these farmers will mainly utilize the first component of our project.
However, some farmers are aware of the line of wheat they are planting and the resistance genes present in their crops. Our mechanism would be tailored to their specific strain of wheat by having our S. cerevisiae EBY100 express the same resistance genes as their wheat. Therefore, if Pgt is detected, we will also be able to distinguish if the race of Pgt present is virulent or not to the specific wheat crops present and if fungicide application is necessary.
Yeast Transformations
Unfortunately, due to cloning difficulties with our yeast expression plasmid, pRS424, we were unable to complete experiments with our AvrSr35 and Sr35 construct as well as our surface display construct. Both constructs were successfully cloned and transformed into S. cerevisiae, but the plates had not grown by the time of Wikifreeze. However, we will wait for the plates to grow and attempt to run our experiments by the Jamboree.
Device and Hardware
To expand upon our hardware, we would like to connect our device to the internet using a Raspberry Pi as suggested by Microsoft so that researchers and government officials can more easily collect data on the presence of rust fungus. We would also like to expand into a greater variety of construction materials, using more durable plastics and testing the durability when exposed to common sanitizing agents. In addition to the physical improvements, we would like to conduct further testing of our hardware and software to determine how well our model could be expanded to other proteins. We would also like to model spore travel and test the quantity of spores collected and germinated using polyethylene disks compared to the polystyrene tested previously. In addition, we would also like to test how well our polyethylene disks break down in the environment."

These dimers are the active transcription factors. Oxygen destabilizes these dimerized iron-sulfur-clusters which results in an inactive state of the transcription factor.

Methods and Results
Cloning
Once the pUC57-simple constructs were delivered, we transformed them into NB bacteria for amplification of the vectors. Once amplified, a digestion on the constructs as well as on the pBR322 vector was performed with EcoRI and HindIII restriction enzymes to cut out the entire sequence (from promoter up to and including the terminator) out of the pUC57-simple construct. The pBR322 vector was chosen since it contains no promoter making it easier to test the FNR promoter. Once the pUC57-simple constructs as well as pBR322 vector were digested a gel extraction was performed to retain the length constructs.  Subsequently a ligation was performed to implant the complete sequences from the pUC57-simple constructs into the pBR322 vector. After ligation the constructs were plated with ampicilin antibiotics (for which resistance is introduced by the pBR322 vector) and grown overnight to create colonies. To check whether ligation had succeeded a colony PCR procedure was performed and the results were loaded on an agarose gel:
colPCRpBR1 Colony PCR of the ligated constructs (Pro1, 1PJN, 1ETF, P(RG) and P(RS)) into pBR322
colPCRpBR2 Colony PCR of the ligated constructs (EGFP, 1G70, P(TK) and P(KS)) into pBR322
Based on the above gels the following constructs were chosen to continue experimentation with: (Pro1(1,2), 1PJN(1,2), 1ETF(3,4), P(RG)(1,2), P(RS)(1,5), EGFP(1,2), 1G70(3,5), P(TK)(2,3), P(KS)(1,3). Small cultures were created, again with ampicilin, and grown overnight. To retain the vectors, a miniprep procedure was performed, the product of which was sequenced allowing us to show that each of the constructs was correctly implemented.  The ligated vectors were then transformed into BL21 bacteria as preparation for protein expression.

Professor Levi mentioned the Tet-Off system, which the team eventually decided to use. Professor Laurens Landeweerd raised ethical issues with the team's treatment project. As well, he helped the team realize how difficult ethics can be to people who lack a background in philosophy. In response, the team created an ethics handbook. Later, they followed up with a professor they contacted early in their project to discuss safety. This professor, Professor Zuckerman, suggested that the team used the Ganciclovir system for their kill switch (a safety mechanism).

2.Team communication
The significance of team interactions has long been recognized by Peking iGEM and this year our team members and instructors had visited several other teams and was involved in a reginal iGEMers' Meet Up in Wuhan this summer.
Furthermore, we have helped other teams in this summer, including BIT, BNU, and OUC-China. See here . We also received help from ZJU-China that they helped us to transfer specific genes into E. coli’s genome. We also helped two high school students from Beijing Huiwen Middle School and Beijing No.4 High School.
3.Investigation beyond bench
Holding the belief that responsive research lies beyond lab bench, we visited Taihu Lake in July to investigate the algal bloom there. We interviewed the researchers in NIGLAS(Nanjing Institute of Geography and Limnology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences) who monitoring the algal bloom there and we sampled the water in the Taihu Lake and brought these samples back to our lab.

Due to the use of two different resistant plasmids, kana and chloramphenicol, we used a plate containing two resistances of kana and chloramphenicol for screening, grew more colonies, and randomly selected 9 singles. After the colonies, we made colony PCR (Fig. 5) and the results showed that both plasmids were transferred.
Fig. 5.  A total of 9 single colonies were verified. Lane 1-9, recombinase expression plasmid validation; line 10, DL2000 DNA Marker; line 11-19, reporter gene expression plasmid validation;line 20, DL2000 DNA Marker.
The verified E. coli was separately placed in a 1.5 ml centrifuge tube containing antibiotic-containing LB medium, and the culture was grown at 37° C and 200 RPM for 6 hours, and then the culture was aliquoted into two portions, one of which was added with an inducer (10 mM Arabinose). Two cultures were grown for 12 hours at 37°C and 200 RPM, and the mixture was incubated for 1 hour at room temperature prior to testing. Both lasers are used to excite both sfGFP and mRFP.
Fig. 6. After adding inducers to induce the production of Bxb1 recombinase, no expected red fluorescence signal representing the ability of recombinase to reverse was detected.
(A)Schematic design of functional verification experiment of Bxb1 recombinase in Prokaryotic Cells
(B)Two repetitions were selected and the results showed no obvious green fluorescence
(C)Two replicates were selected after addition of the inducer and the results showed no obvious red fluorescence
The result shows no obvious fluorescence. We changed some conditions, such as lowering the temperature, adjusting the rotation speed, adjusting the time, etc. But we still did not get the expected results. We consulted the teacher and the teacher replied that there might be weak fluorescence but our instrument couldn't detect it.
Although the prokaryotic function verification of the Bxb1 recombinase plasmid given by Peking University failed, unexpectedly, we successfully verified   the function of the Bxb1 recombinase optimized by codons function in eukaryotic cells. We have not yet found out the reason for the failure. But we decided to shelve our doubts for the time being and continue other experiments.

Deinococcus
Deinococcus species are hardy gram-negative bacteria that can survive acute radiation exposures up to 10,000 Gray units of ionizing radiation. 5 Deinococcus species genomes' have been sequenced at this time, including Deinococcus radiodurans - the most infamous member of the phylum Deinococcus-Thermus that is so tough it's been named 'Conan the Bacterium'. We hope to expand the sequence information in this phylum and enable sequence similarity studies in the future.

Project Overview
Background
Fungal pathogens are a major public health threat with significant global effects which, surprisingly, is not being addressed as it should.
Our project!
We want to produce peptides that bind to fungi. See why this matters.
Perspectives
The peptides we generated can be further refined and potentially become diagnosis and therapeutic tools.
Dry lab
Our peptides are small and fit into a scaffold with a known structure. We simulated their three-dimensional structure by homology modelling.
Wet lab
We've been busy at the lab picking peptides and much more. See how we did it.
Gallery
As the old adage goes: pics or it didn't happen.
BioBricks
We want to share what we did so others can develop it further. There are also some tools for working with yeasts. Take a look at our BioBricks.

This is the offcial website of our school. And you can find aboved links there.
     1.Training for iGEM
The iGEM program requires the interdisciplinary abilities. To approach this purpose, we designed a series of trainings including computer programming, biological experiment skills, etc. (The following photographs illustrates the process) The collegiate team from Zhejiang University provides an opportunity which shows us how the biological experiments run.
     2. Pre-research of project
We distributed questionnaires and conducted survey in order to learn about the current knowledge of local peoples towards cultural artifacts in Hangzhou. The following diagrams are analyzed by the data. According to the data, the current situation of protection and renovating towards cultural artifacts and synthetic biology does not have bright prospects. The lack of attentions in civilians can cause the enormous negative effects on research and the practical usage, so we organized a series of activities to publicize the cultural artifacts in Hangzhou, the synthetic biology.(more details in Publicity)
     3.Publicity
(1)To acquaint students synthetic biology, our team’s human practice group publicize this subject several times during the summer break in our city including the danger and benefits of transgenosis food that was familiar and relevant to the citizens.  Furthermore, we upload the basic synthetic biology knowledge in our school’s official website for months and update the latest information or the experimental knowledge at a time period.
(2)We hold a presentation in our school to introduce the iGEM to our successors. It consists that the general ideas of iGEM, the specific parts which are totally different from the biology competition in China, the judgements, also Q&A section and the advantages of taking this competition. Our team leader Andrew Luo gave an excellent lecture.
(3)As we mentioned before, to introduce local citizens the importance of cultural artifacts in this city,  we sent out the specialized post cards with 7 different kinds of landscape seals and our team seal in order to publicize our project and the local artifacts protection at the same time.

UESTC-China,2017,Team:UESTC-China#test4_-_-_TEXT.html,"Concluding our Collaboration with the RIVM, we attended a meeting organized by the RIVM and the Rathenau institute, with the theme: “Veilig verder met synthetische biologie”, or “Making safe progress in synthetic biology”. During this meeting we gave a short presentation about the topic of our project and how we integrated ""Safe by design"" through toxin specificity, controlled expression of the toxin and confinement of our product to the beehive.
October: Lunch lecture at Wageningen University
The last month before the wiki-freeze we organized a lunch lecture at the university for researchers, beekeepers, students and other interested people to present our project and collect input for the last time.
Media
We have contacted various newspaper and magazines to inform the public about our project. Not only did we tried to reach out to the Wageningen community but also to alumni, beekeepers, scientist from outside Wageningen and people who are interested in synthetic biology. Partly to receive input about or project and partly because we are just very proud about how our project turned out. We also proactively kept people updated with the help of a Social Media campaign.
Resource and Wageningen World
The resource is the magazine for students and employees of Wageningen University. They have dedicated several articles to our work. They focussed on the content of our project but also about our reach out to the public to raise money with a crowdfunding platform.
June: General article about our project.
July: article about our crowdfunding.
July: Blog inspired by our project.
August: article announcing that we will go to Boston with our project.
August: article directed at alumni of Wageningen UR with a request to help with crowdfunding.
People were able to leave us messages through the crowdfunding platform . Some of them we translated to English. Thank you for the kind words!

Lyophilization Is a Good Choice for Cell-Extract Storage
With regard to global application of Phactory it is crucial to enable long-term storage and shipping of our cell extract. In order to fulfill these requirements, we chose to freeze-dry our cell extract. Lyophilized extract can be stored at ambient temperature and can be reactivated by addition of only nuclease-free water.  Initial tests for the optimal lyophilization conditions revealed several important points:
cell extract quality is only preserved when cell-extract is mixed with the TXTL reaction buffer prior to lyophilization
the preservation of quality does not depend on the size of lyophilized extract aliquots
We tested the expression quality of several of our home-made cell extracts from fresh and lyophilized aliquots. This comparison also includes the commercially available myTXTL® cell-free expression system (arbor biosciences) and highlights two important results of our efforts to optimize production of cell extract:
our improved cell extract can be lyophilized and retains 40-70 % of its performance
our final settings for cell extract preparation yield extract that clearly outperforms the commercial system, with up to 9-fold higher protein expression
Our two tested samples of cell extract retained 70 and 90 % of expression quality respectively after lyophilization.
Synthetic Phage Manufacturing
Phages were manufactured based on three components: the cell extract, an energy solution (ATP, GTP, NAD+ etc.) and a supplement solution (amino acids, tRNAs, pholic acid etc.). The only additional component for phage assembly is pure phage DNA. We expanded the assembly platform by
producing the first clinically relevant phages at therapeutic concentrations
manufacturing of therapeutic phages independent of a living pathogen
achieving similar phage titers as the commercial cell extract
determining the amount of DNA necessary for sufficient phage assembly
calculating the amount of DNA produced in the cell extract by replication
DNA Purification
An essential part of bacteriophage manufacturing is the DNA. We extracted it by Phenol-Chloroform precipitation. The Purification was controlled with an agarose gel, where two distinct bands (the proper high-mass band and a low-mass band) were present for all four samples.
To reduce the amount of the low-mass bands, the protocol was changed to a column-based technique. With this technique the incorrect band was significantly reduced in all samples, which was proven with an agarose gel.

Type of venom
Venom refers to varieties of toxins produced by certain types of animals. One of the most common venoms are produced by snakes where 15% of 3,000 species of snakes are found poisonous. Snake venom consists of proteins, enzymes, substances with a cytotoxins, neurotoxins and coagulants
Most snake envenomings and fatalities are found in South Asia, South East Asia and sub-Saharan Africa with the high fatality rate of 125,000 deaths per annual. Among these India is reported the most cuased by big 4 including Russell's viper, Indian cobra, saw-scaled viper, and the common krait. Indian cobra is found the most famous and make the highest fatality rate (43%) in India and Southeast asia.
Indian cobra venom contains a potent post-synaptic neurotoxin which acts on the synaptic gaps of the nerves, thereby paralyzing muscles, and in severe bites leading to acute respiratory failure or cardiac arrest. The components of venom include lysis enzymes such as hyaluronidase which increase the spread of the venom. Its toxicity is found one of the highest based on LD50 value in mice. Symptoms of cobra envenomation can begin from 15 minutes to two hours after the bite, and can be fatal in less than an hour.

YEASTILIZATION
The problem
In the current state of industrial biotechnology, the vast majority of biorefineries rely on edible substrates such as corn, wheat or sugar cane. This has sparked the food vs. fuel debate, leading to the fundamental question whether we should use our edible crops to feed the growing human population, or to provide sustainable chemicals. The limiting factor for current processes is the lack of molecular tools,                             which restricts biotechnology to conventional organisms that are optimised for a limited number of substrates.
The solution
The development of new technologies such as CRISPR/Cas9 and Next-generation sequencing has dramatically reduced the effort required to genetically modify non-model organisms, and is effectively breaking down the barrier between model and non-model organisms. In our project we utilise Yarrowia lipolytica, in order to solve the food vs. fuel dilemma while simultaneously making industrial biotechnology an integrated part of waste handling.

Get Clotho Now!
This is the notebook of Nade Sritanyaratana. I got involved in iGEM through word of my instructor. I am a 4th year undergraduate at UC Berkeley in Bioengineering with a concentration in imaging, and I hope to attend a PhD graduate program in the upcoming year. My prior research experience consists of working with bioengineering professor Steven Conolly in the summer and fall of 2007. Beyond imaging, my academic interests include biomechanics; signals and systems; circuit analysis; systems biology; and linear optimization.
Now that iGEM is over, my new role as a part of Dr. Douglas Densmore's lab is to solidify the tool, iron out any bugs, and make the Clotho Parts Manager user-customizable. My team roles during iGEM can be found here.
EDIT: As of after iGEM and the start of Spring 2009, the purpose of this notebook has now changed.

Stony_Brook,2018,Team:Stony Brook#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," mathematical model for simulating metabolism if given specific input and constraints of a certain metabolite, over the incorporation of the Michaelis- Menten equation in our model. He explained that use of the Michaelis- Menten equations in models is only useful in “test- tubes” situations where all of the the constants and parameters are known and fixed. However, this this is not true for a cell in which concentrations of substances and the rate of protein synthesis are constantly changing. He went on to explain that while the Michaelis- Menten equation uses steady state approximation to find all rates of enzymes involved, you cannot do that in a cell whose rates of enzymes are changing in a realistic situation. In other words, you cannot find steady state approximation of cell. Furthermore, the Michaelis-Menten equation only concerns one substrate molecule, however our research concerns bimolecular substrate reactions. Thus, upon advice from Dr. French regarding the direction of our modeling, we decided to conduct more research on flux balance analysis. We found that flux balance analysis may be a  more  conducive model for our work with cell biology because flux balance analysis assumes that all chemical reactions within a  cell have reached equilibrium almost as if the cell were in a steady state. Furthermore, using flux balance analysis, a model can be built from a  matrix of stoichiometric reactions taking place within the cell. Thus, we made the decision to shift our model focus from the Michaelis- Menten equation to flux balance analysis.  
October 5th: Meeting with Laura Curran and Staff Members (County Executive, Nassau County)  
Members of our iGEM team met with County Executive Laura Curran and two of her staff members, Sean Sallie and David Viana, to discuss the science behind our project, the implications of biofuel use on the economy, and the process of making biofuel. More specifically, one topic we discussed was how the revenue from producing biofuels could trickle back into funding the research behind these improving these processes. To this extent, her staff was very interested in increasing the sustainability of our project, and so we agreed to send our project poster and full wiki information after the Jamboree, such that they could help reach out to other leaders to help making carbon sinking more of a reality. We reached out to Laura Curran because she is a powerful and respected leader within Nassau County’s local government and we not only wanted her perspective on the importance of funding biofuel research but also we aimed to share our knowledge with an individual who had the ability to make impactful change in the community.

SDU-Denmark,2017,Team:SDU-Denmark#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," figure 1. When the transcription factor OmpR is phosphorylated by EnvZ, expression of genes controlled by the OmpR-regulated promoter is initiated. Excitation of the PCB by red light, results in a situation, where EnvZ will not be able to phosphorylate the transcription factor OmpR. The lack of phosphorylated OmpR leads to no activation of the OmpR-regulated promoter, thereby preventing gene expression by this promoter.
RelE and RelB Comprise a Toxin-Antitoxin System in E. coli
A toxin-antitoxin system is a system composed of two gene products, of which one specifies a cell toxin and the other an antitoxin, which neutralises the toxic effect caused by the toxin. In E. coli K-12 the cytotoxin RelE and antitoxin RelB comprise such a system Gotfredsen M, Gerdes K. The Escherichia coli relBE genes belong to a new toxin-antitoxin gene family. Molecular microbiology. 1998;29(4):1065-76. . Expression of the cytotoxin RelE inhibits translation in the cells, due to its ability to cleave mRNA found in the A-site of the ribosome Pedersen K, Zavialov AV, Pavlov MY, Elf J, Gerdes K, Ehrenberg M. The bacterial toxin RelE displays codon-specific cleavage of mRNAs in the ribosomal A site. Cell. 2003;112(1):131-40. . RelB neutralise the toxic effect of RelE through interaction between the two proteins. In situations of amino acid starvation, it is appropriate for the bacteria to halt the translation in order to avoid errors owing to absent amino acids. Consequently, one of the exciting factors for the expression of RelE is conditioned by amino acid starvation Pedersen K, Zavialov AV, Pavlov MY, Elf J, Gerdes K, Ehrenberg M. The bacterial toxin RelE displays codon-specific cleavage of mRNAs in the ribosomal A site. Cell. 2003;112(1):131-40. .
Whether the cell lie dormant in response to expression of RelE depends on the ratio of RelB and RelE present in the cell. Several studies have shown that RelB RelE form a complex with RelB:RelE stoichiometry of 2:1 Overgaard M, Borch J, Gerdes K. RelB and RelE of Escherichia coli form"
Sydney_Australia,2016,Team:Sydney Australia#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," silicon content can result in cell toxicity, while Flinkinger et. al. (2007) attributed increased cell death to alcohol toxicity when lyogels are formed via crosslinkage.
Electrospinning
Another novel technique involves spinning fibres of polymers similar to those used in polymer anchoring tainted with cells into a nanofibre matrix (Close et. al., 2009). Stretching individual drops of the polymer cell solution by electrostatic means creates the fibres. Work by Salalha et. al. (2006), found that such method allows cell viability to remain for a three month period when stored below -20 degrees Celsius. Klein et. al. (2009) proved that this technique is successful in cell entrapment for use in bioremediation contexts, despite reduced cell activity.
Hydrogels
Many technologies take advantage of the ease of creation of hydrogel structures, such as gel beads, to render cells functionless for use in a biosensor capacity (Ahmed, 2015). As indicated by Flickinger et. al., (2007), the required thickness of these gels creates a high mass transfer resistance. In spite of this, the pores have thin walls and are macroscopic, increasing the risk of contamination incredibly. Despite work by Okamura and Ito (2001) to add crosslinking of molecules to this process, which increased the structural and mechanical integrity of hydrogels (Kopecek, 2007), they cannot be attached to other surfaces as would be required in this context (Flickinger et. al., (2007).
Latex
Flickinger et. al. (2007), presented a novel way to immobilize cells via the creation of a nanoporous latex biocoating. The method involves creating a mixture of latex enhanced with carbohydrate complexes and cells (50% v), and rolling it on any surface using a Meyer pull-down rolling system to a thickness of less than 100um. Upon setting, the presence of polymer particles allows for the formation of nanopores that will allow small micromolecules such as ethylene in, but will be too small to allow cells to permeate out. These nanopores also allow for nutrients to reach the cells to increase the shelf life of the coatings. The drying process results in desiccation of the cells such that they can no longer replicate, but can still retain protein/transcribing functions. The cells are thus permanently immobilised in the coating. Such method has a low capital cost, and is very resource efficient.

Putting Our Prototype Together
Results
Our Goal
For our prototype we wanted to really showcase how our construct would work in a real life scenario in terms of forming an actual clot and how long it would take as well as the application method of using a pre-filled syringe.
Initial Design
For our initial design of our prototype we started off with the blood being contained in a tank where it will then be sucked up and go through some medical tubing. Then there would be a flow meter that would measure the pressure of the blood. The tubing will lead the blood to our slab of meat that is contained inside of our splash box. (The splash box initial design would be made out of plexiglass so that the viewer can see nicely through it). At this point the blood will be gushing out, simulating an actual wound site. Then more medical tubing will allow for the excess blood to go through our second flow meter where it will again measure the pressure before it is collected in our blood bucket at the end.
Buying All Of The Parts
When it came to actually buying all of our prototype parts, we had to take the prices of every part into perspective. Because the flow meters are really expensive we decided not to include them in the final design of our prototype. We bought four different types of medical tubing (one clear type of tubing that had a fairly small diameter, another clear one with a larger diameter, a yellow flexible one that also had a large diameter and a blue one that had a small diameter). In total the tubing was around $30.00 and the one that we chose to use in our prototype was the small clear one because we want to show the blood as it travels through it and it fit around the tip of the syringe nicely. We decided to just use a syringe instead of using the flow meters to pump the blood up from the container, so we will fill the syringe up with the blood before we attach it to the tubing. We also"

Thursday July 19th
The day started off with us receiving the MG1655 strain we ordered from Yale University. Even though we already began to use samples from one of our mentors' labs, it was a good idea for us to make liquid cultures and plates of the cells in case something went wrong. The two enzymes required in the pathway for breaking down ethylene glycol also underwent PCR along with genomic data from the MG1655 and DH5α cells. Luria Broth (LB) was made for kanamycin plates as well. We preformed ligation and transformations of the genomic data into the DH5α cells, and successfully cultured competent cells. At the end of the day, we rehydrated primers for the mutated cutinase as well, with a hope that the mutations will improve the cutinase functioning. On the protein end of things we manually fit the ligands into the active site of LC Cutinase in pymol. However, upon loading these files in Foldit the protein did not wrap around the ligand as hoped. We then seeked out an alternative means in which to better fit or dock the ligands into the active site. Nano-dropped gel purifications.
Friday July 20th
We purified PCR of dehydrogenase. Competent cells failed, so we remade some more while making some modifications to the protocol. In addition we performed some gel DNA clean up, mini preps, digestions, ligations, and transformations. We decided on using Swissdock, a ligand to protein docking program, to fit our two ligands into LC Cutinase. This program ran a majority of the day but we received successful docking files for both ligands by the end of the day. Minipreps of J23100, J23101, K206000, R0010, B0034
Week 6
Monday July 23rd
We ran a gel and did some PCR cleanup. More work was done on SOEing. Did some digests, sent stuff for sequencing, and worked on reductase part construction. For the protein part of the project we moved forward with our successful docking files to load them into the Foldit program. However, we ran into technical difficulties with the requirements Foldit had for file types accepted. Ran gel digests/ purifications on J23100,"

Construction of the integron
     As said in the introduction, an integron is composed of different gene cassettes located downstream of a recombinase-encoding conserved sequence. To allow genes rearrangement, they must be flanked by attc sites. Indeed, these sites are recognized by the recombinase that allows the excision of the different gene cassettes and their integration in another attc site. In the results, we showed that we had to add an RFC10 prefix and a RBS sequence upstream of each gene and an attc site followed by a RFC10 suffix downstream of the gene. In the future, we should build the remaining microcin biobricks. The next step will be to assemble all the biobrick parts of the Microcin B17 and C7. Those genes could be assembled in the natural or in a random order. Thereafter, the integron biobrick has to be put in an iGEM plasmid provided by Mazel D. – pSWlib. This plasmid contains – between the promoter and the RFC10 region – an attI site which is required for the recombination by the integrase to occur.
Competitions
     In order to select the most productive genes rearrangement, we have to exert a strong selection pressure on the bacteria containing the integron and integrase biobricks. To this end, we could use the properties of microcin and put into competition two E. coli strains. The first strain should carry the microcin B17 integron plasmid, the integrase plasmid and a plasmid that contains the immune genes of microcin C7. The other strain should carry the microcin C7 integron plasmid, the integrase plasmid and a plasmid that contains the immune gene of microcin B17. The upstream promoter of the immune genes has to be carefully chosen to confer the bacteria a low resistance against the microcin they don’t express. Therefore, the more bacteria produce one type of microcin, the more they will kill the bacteria producing the other type of microcin. This way, we could select a population of bacteria that produces the more efficiently its microcin. We could simplify our experiment by putting"

Paris_Saclay,2015,Team:Paris Saclay#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," is indirectly determined by the outside temperature.
The thermal control part of the system (described below) could be implemented on a plasmid or onto an other localization of the E. coli chromosome. If this plasmid is lost by the bacterium, the Tet Repressor will constitutively inhibit the transcription of the downstream essential gene, and the bacterium will die. The same scenario will happen if one of the system elements undergone a mutation.
Figure 3.1 - Chromosomal essential genes control - E. coli chromosome
How our system could be adapted to biologists needs
In order to answer the problematic of system adaptability, we choose to use molecules that undergo structural changes depending on the temperature.
To achieve this goal, two molecules have been selected: an RNA thermosensor and a thermosensitive repressor. These two molecules define a high and a low temperature limitation. They can be introduced in a plasmid or introduced inside of the chromosome, under the control of a constitutive promoter.
Figure 3.2 - Thermal control device - Plasmid or chromosome
The first part of the system consists in a thermosensitive variant of transcriptional repressor cI from bacteriophage lambda.  cI repressor protein acts as a dimer to bind to promoters and repress downstream gene expression. For cI(Ts), a cI protein variant, the dimerization happen only if the temperature is under 42 degrees, since at high temperatures cI(Ts) is denatured and cannot dimerize. Consequently the cI(Ts) protein is not functional above 42 degrees. Other variants of the cI repressor can be created by inducing mutations near the dimerization site, in order to change the denaturation temperature.
Behind the thermosensitive cI variant, instead of its native RBS, we used an RNA thermometer which is based on a ROSE RNA thermometer retrieved from Bradyrhizobium japonicum. The temperature sensitive hairpin of this RNA thermometer that contains the Shine Dalgarno (SD) sequence is closed when the temperature is under 32°C, that structurally prevent the ribosome binding to the downstream RNA sequence, and so it cannot start to translate RNA. The translation can only be initiated when the temperature is around 32°C, when the hairpin is opened and so the SD sequence is available for the ribosome binding. The switch temperature of the thermometer RNA is easily tunable by mutations in order to stabilize or destabilize its Shine Dalgarno hairpin.

Education
Brochure
In order to promote the science of synthetic biology, promote biosafety and promote our team's projects, we decided to make a brochure on synthetic biology after discussion. To make the brochure more interesting, we wrote a coherent story of the project and produced four cartoons to vividly visualize super-resistant bacteria. On the first day of school, we sent the brochure to the freshmen. After receiving the brochure, the students were reading it carefully. Some interested students even asked us for more knowledge about synthetic biology. We hope that this brochure will stimulate students' interest in synthetic biology and participate in more activities related to synthetic biology in the future.
TV interview
We were unexpectedly interviewed by TV stations. Zhejiang Satellite TV, the full name of the Zhejiang Radio and Television Group satellite TV channel, is the integrated satellite TV channel of Zhejiang Radio and Television Group, which was broadcasted on October 1, 1960. After listening to our project introduction and project background, they thought that bacterial resistance is an environmental pollution problem that the public ignored. They are very interested. They hope that we can introduce them in detail to attract the public. Pay attention to the issue of bacterial resistance. Then we saw our interview in Zhejiang Satellite TV. I hope that through the media, our project can arouse the public's attention to this issue.
Open a public course
In order to meet the needs of more people, we applied to the school this year to open a public elective course on the basis of molecular genetic machine engineering design, which allows college students interested in synthetic biology to independently learn the knowledge related to synthetic biology, we have provided A platform that can learn the knowledge of synthetic biology, we are pleasantly surprised that the class was full, and in addition, we introduced the igem competition, these college students showed a very strong interest and enthusiasm.
WeChat public account online
WeChat is a popular social software in China for communication by mobile phone. Some middle-aged and elderly people in China don't always believe in rumors. In order to disseminate scientific and technological knowledge to them, some scientific and reasonable views have been disseminated to prevent the elderly from being misled by rumors. We created two WeChat rumors, including bacterial resistance and GM food safety; and were promoted and forwarded in a circle of friends."
Harvard,2011,Team:Harvard#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," individual researchers would otherwise face. From the perspective of consumers purchasing zinc fingers, valuable time and negotiation costs may be saved by working with one company rather than many.
Conclusion: Striking a Balance
The ultimate goal of both Sangamo and other researchers is to make progress in scientific innovation while gaining profit from intellectual property. Naturally both Sangamo and other science researchers will tend to maximize personal profit; however, we suggest that the optimal scenario would maximize both scientific progress and the collective profit gained by each research actor.
The Harvard iGEM Proposition
An optimal resolution can be achieved only by a proper balance between intellectual property right regulation and open source technology; therefore we propose that there be an investigation into the current status of the zinc finger intellectual market with respect to the social and private profit-maximizing values. Currently the market lies heavily in favor of maximizing the private profits for Sangamo and the chance that this is the overall profit-maximizing equilibrium is therefore lessened. Only by properly informing the scientific community of the implications of imbalance between intellectual property rights and open source technology can we hope to achieve the most efficient research conditions for the future of synthetic biology research.
One way to do this would be to follow the model of the European Union. In most European countries, patent laws ""include a 'research exception' which permits use of  a patented invention for experimental purposes without infringing the rights of the holder. Additionally, there are further exceptions such as those in respect of private and non-commercial use."" [7] In the United Kingdom, specifically,  ""those acts which do not constitute an infringement are set out in Section 60(5) of the Patents Act 1977."" [7] How can the United States remain competitive in the long-term with countries who allow for academic research without fear of infringement - and have done so for the past 30 years?
A research exception could provide the needed balance between IP and research: companies could maintain their profitability, while scientists could use the best methods and ideas in their academic research, without fear of litigation.

Description
This project involves the modification of the bacterium Escherichia coli, through Synthetic Biology, which is based on the creation or modification of existing organisms, making them have the characteristics that we want. This organism will sense the high levels of alpha, beta, gamma rays and X-rays emitted, factors that cause a mutation in the DNA of said bacterium that will give a purple coloration and the aroma to lemon. To validate that the research is necessary and supported by specialists in the area, a survey was conducted to radiology students, medical technologists and radiology center workers, obtaining an 83% approval, on the need for better dosimeters that are reliable results .
The sensor and its parts
For this through a scientific investigation, a sensor was designed that is based on a biphasic switch, device that can be turned off or on according to the concentration of the imput. This switch naturally regulates lambda phage, which in this case when activated the Promoter pRM gives way to the transcription of the Cl repressor, which in turn will cause inhibition of the Pr promoter and can not be transcribed Cro, LuxR and LuxI. In contrast, if DNA damage is detected with the help of the RecA protein, the Cl repressor is removed and the pRM promoter is stopped, giving rise to pR (promoter) activation and to the transcription of Cro, LuxR and LuxI .
This circuit is based on the bacteriophage (phage) lambda lysogenic, double-stranded DNA that infects E. coli and was discovered in 1951 by Esther Lederberg. Its cohesive ends of the genetic material, after the infection causes its genome to be circulated, and if it continues with the lysogenic cycle behaves like a plasmid taking advantage of the enzymes of the recombination of the bacterium integrating itself in the genome of the latter. In the lysogenic cycle, the virus is inserted at a specific point in the genome of the bacterium and replicated when it does so, passing its genes to E. coli. Duplicates. The virus synthesizes from the Cl repressor, which inhibits the expression of the rest of the genes, where in conditions of cellular stress the bacterium activates the SOS response, acting RecA to inhibit the activity of the Cl repressor that ends a cascade response that causes the Integrated virus switch to lithic route. This is where the cell is usually infected, producing viral particles that are released into the medium, once the host bacterium is lysed (breaks the cell membrane),"

Meet up
“A Joy Shared Is a Joy Tripled”  When we met up with other iGEMers to share our                                 projects and the difficulties, we encountered with each other, enjoyed the process                                 and often caused resonance. What's more, we could inspire more ideas and find the                                 possibility of cooperation.
Meetup with OT-2 principal, Kristin
We meet-up with OT-2 principal, Kristin. We asked her some problem about OT-2,                                         and briefly introduced our project to get some feedback from her.

During the meetup, we asked her some problems about                                                 our                                                 robot that we have met in                                                 this morning and she answered us that there were still some components                                                 being                                                 shipped so hopefully we                                                 could wait until those components to arrive. For the software problems,                                                 she                                                 built a forum for all                                                 the iGEM teams which got the robot so that we could discuss online or                                                 sharing all kinds of protocol                                                 with each other.
We also briefly introduced our project but since we                                                 didn't                                                 have too much time so she                                                 could only                                                 suggest us to study more related topic of iGEM. She is willing to                                                 have                                                 next video meeting with us                                                 and expertly we could show her our device next time. We were so glad to                                                 have this talk that day.

We have a video meeting with Tec-Monterrey. After introducing our project to                                         them, they remind us to think about our end product which can make our project                                         more complete.

We had a video meeting with Tec-Monterrey. After                                                 introducing our project to them,                                                 they had pointed out some aspects that we need to think more about.                                                 They                                                 reminded us to think about                                                 our end product which can make our project more complete.
During the meeting, we came up out with the ideas to                                                 collaborate with each other.                                                 Their project has two                                                 parts. The main part is E-coding, which uses bacteria to record the                                                 data.                                                 Another part is to sense                                                 the pollutant in river of Mexico, which is the part that we could link                                                 our                                                 work.

Cologne-Duesseldorf,2017,Team:Cologne-Duesseldorf#Eric_-_-_TEXT.html,"opsis thaliana and its interaction partner PIF6. These two proteins, also derived from Arabidopsis thaliana, bind together upon irradiation by red light (660 nm) and separate upon irradiation with far-red light (780 nm). We used this property to activate a split version of a TEV-protease whose split halves were each fused to one of the two optogenetic proteins.
The TEV-protease was obtained from the Biobrick BBa_K1319004. This variant contains the anti self-cleavage mutation S219V. Using overhang-PCR we created a split version of the Biobrick protease based on work done by Wehr et al, 2016 and the iGEM team Munich 2013 . The split was made between amino acid 118 and 119.
Our construct for attaching proteins N-and C-terminally is highly variable: it consists only of a TEV-cleavage site, the PTS2 sequence and a short linker and was designed as a 3b-part for the yeast-toolbox . This means that we can attach any protein to its N- or C-terminus we desire.  We planned on attaching different fluorescent proteins to each sides of the 3b-part in a level 1 ligation. For our experiment we planned on using the pairs mTurquoise-mVenus and GFP-mRuby.
Figure 9.2 level 1 plasmid containing the sequence coding for the GFP-PTS2-Ruby fusion protein
The two other constructs were planned as follows: Phytochrome B was fused to the C-terminal TEV-half, PIF6 was fused to the N-terminal TEV-half. The PhyB-TEV2 part and the TEV1-PIF6 part were supposed to be inserted into a shared plasmid via a level 2 Golden Gate ligation. Finally, the level 2 plasmid and the remaining level 1 construct were to be co transformed into S. cerevisiae. Our experiment consisted of illuminating one sample with red light (660 nm) while keeping another sample in the dark. Fluorescence microscopy would then be used to check whether the import was successful [3]. If cleavage and subsequent protein import was successful, fluorescence of one protein would be localized to the compartment while that of the other would be observed throughout the cell.
Optogenetically controlled gene expression
This project is based on work done by Weber et al, 2016 . Using the interaction between Phytochrome B and PIF6 they designed an optogenetic switch"

Zhang lab
We used the pX334a plasmid (Addgene plasmid 42333) provided by the Zhang lab (Cong et al., Science 2013). This plasmid contains a human codon-optimized Cas9 with a nickase function (humanized S. pyogenes Cas9 (D10A) nickase). This hSpCas9 is flanked by two NLS and fused N-terminally to an HA-tag. Because of the D10A mutation, hSpCas9 is only able to introduce single strand breaks. We used this hSpCas9 as a template to introduce a second mutation that removed the nickase function (H840A, Jinek et al., Science 2012) and for our standardization mutagenesis. Our registry dCas9 device contains a different promoter, HA-tag, NLS and backbone. The pX334a plasmid also includes tracrRNA and crRNA loci which we amplified for further cloning of the RNAimer plasmid.

Results
Throughout the iGEM season 2017 we developed Standard Operating Procedures and an in silico sensor design algorithm that is described in the design section. These process innovations led to the subsequent optimization of a well performing sensor for Taenia solium:
In the first series of screenings we reproduced published data of sensor 27B from the 2016 Pardee et al paper describing a toehold switch for Zika Virus:
We tested a first series of sensors that were designed by predicting the secondary structure of possible sensors and then selecting sensors with a low normalized ensemble defect. A low normalized ensemble defect indicates that a potential sensor spontaneously forms a secondary structure that is similar to the secondary structure of a toehold switch. This design principle led to sensors that did not show unspecific reaction, but that neither reacted upon adding trigger RNA. Trigger RNA was the only published RNA-Sequence of T. solium: TSO_31
In the next series of sensors tested, we replaced the selection based on the normalized ensemble defect with the score calculation mentioned in the design section. This led to a significant improvement of the sensor opening. At the same time, sensors showed a quite high degree of unspecific reactions.

We obtained raw RNAseq data of Taenia Solium from GEO database (GSM2227058) and mapped it against a published genome of T. solium (PRJNA170813). In this way we identified 215 potential targets for sensor development. The interactive map on the left shows these targets. The darker the dot, the higher the expression level. Upon clicking on a dot, absolute expression level, Coding Sequence, information on splicing and GeneDB identifier is displayed. You can download the underlying data in an excel file here .
In our analysis we ranked the 215 potential RNA targets by their expression level. The target with the highest expression level was chosen for further sensor development: TsM_000297600.
Upon identifying a new, unique and highly expressed RNA molecule in the transcriptome of Taenia Solium, we created a new series of sensors aiming at this"

Nevertheless, for the LigA based NAD+ detection system it has been proven that it can be coupled to NADH-dependent enzymatic reactions. This makes the NAD+ bioassay suitable for a wide range of biological studies dealing with the ubiquitous cofactors NADH/NAD+.
Molecular cloning
Because DNA ligase from E. coli is commercially aquirable for cloning purposes LigA (<partinfo>BBa_K525710</partinfo>) was tested whether it is also suitable for molecular cloning procedures. Hence, cloning of rfp into a pSB1C3 vector was performed with LigA. Ligation was done with NAD+ bioassay buffer containing 10 mM NAD+ at 37 °C or 22 °C and the vectors were transformed into E. coli KRX by electroporation. After growth over night at 37 °C on petri dishes the results were documented (Figure 23).
Figure 23: rfp cloning without any ligase (A) or with ligation by DNA ligase from E. coli (LigA) at 37 °C (B) and 22 °C (C). The picture shows the grown colonies after transformation of a control sample (rfp and cut pSB1C3) or ligation sample (rfp and cut pSB1C3 with LigA) into E. coli KRX.
By analyzing the number of colony forming units and color of the colonies the ligation efficiency of LigA should be assessable. As shown for the sample without any ligase only few clones were able to grow on chloramphenicol supplemented LB medium. A much bigger number of clones was observed when ligation by LigA was performed at 22 °C. Furthermore, there were a lot of red colonies indicating positive clones. Deductively, LigA might be useful for (large-scale) molecular cloning procedures which could be beneficial because of its easy production in E. coli and simple purification.
