The key role of Integrated Human Practices in our project
Because our project was focused on tackling a problem extremely relevant to our society, it was essential that we looked at the impact our project would have and how we could adapt our design according to the acquired information from stakeholder dialogues. Only then would our project have the desired value to be able to contribute to the issue of antibiotic resistance. Developing a detection method in the lab is one challenge, but developing a detection method that could be used in the real world is another, more complex, challenge. The complexity of the challenge in the antibiotic field made it hard to find the niche in which we could apply and validate"

I Introdution
    The game “E.coli War” is designed based on our fluid model. In the game, E.coli are divided into two groups, with each group having three kinds of E.coli: warriors, farmers and beggars.
Warriors can attack the enemy
Farmers can provide food for others
Beggars just consume resources
PS：The nutrient produced by farmers can be utilized by all E.coli. It can simulate grabbing of the enemy's grain during a war.
II Rule
    There are 60,000 E.coli at the beginning of a game. They are divided equally into farmers,warriors and beggars. You and AI will get a total of 30,000 E.coli, but the distribution of each kind of E.coli is random. The game is composed of five rounds. In each round, you can allocate 6,000 E.coli .The maximal number of E.coli that your group eventually reach will be your grade. If your grade is greater than that of AI, then you win this round. If you win three rounds, then congratulations, you win the game!

We extracted the plasmid (10:00) and do double enzyme digestion (18:10~23:10). Then we did gel electrophoresis to verify the results (23:49).
From the result we can conclude that all plasmids have been successfully amplified.

The plate grow out with a lot of false colonies (with green fluorescence due to GFP in I20260). We doubt that it was due to the enzyme digestion efficiency and strong self ligation, so we tried to do enzyme digestion and ligation again with the linearized plasmid provided by Parts Registry in 2014 kit. We also recalculated the molar ratio of RBS, chromoprotein and plasmid backbone and try to make it into 10:3:1.

Gel 12: Colony PCR of 19 colonies picked from cells transformed with CPEC assembled PA2652 construct, about half have the correct size insert, these will be inoculated and miniprepped. Gel 13: Two more colony PCRs which were unsuccesfull, followed by five colony PCRs from negative control colonies (assembly of backbone vector without insert)showing backbone vector (6a) in one. The next well is a positive control colony PCR with plasmid 6a. The final two wells are analytical PCRs of the CPEC assembly and negative control with sequencing primers showing the correct size band for the assembled insert.
Testing
Testing for chemotaxis can be split into qualitative and quantitative assays. Qualitative assays involve putting engineered E. coli and an attractant onto semi-solid agar plates and observe the movement of the microbes. If they can be observed to move towards the attractant source, they are likely to be attracted to the ligand. In quantitative assays, capillaries are filled with different concentrations of the attractant malate. Positive controls are provided by filling identical capillaries with different concentrations of serine, which E. coli naturally move towards. Negative controls are provided by filling capillaries with media that does not contain a source of attractant. The amount of bacteria that swim into each capillary is evaluated by FACS.
For simplicity, we will be working with Arabidopsis to observe the uptake of bacteria into plant roots. Arabidopsis thaliana is a common plant model organism. It belongs to the mustard family and fulfils many important requirements for model organisms. As such, its genome has been almost completely sequenced and replicates quickly, producing a large number of seeds. It is easily transformed and many different mutant strains have been constructed to study different aspects (National Institute of Health, no date). While Arabidopsis may not represent plant populations naturally occurring in arid areas threatened by desertification, it is a handy model organism we will be using to study the effect of auxin on roots, observe chemotaxis towards them and look at uptake of bacteria into the roots.
We will be using Arabidopsis to look at the uptake of our engineered bacteria into the plants. For this, we will be using wild type Arabidopsis and E. coli that constitutively express green fluorescent protein. The natural fluorescence produced by plant roots and green fluorescence produced by the bacteria can be used to image the uptake of bacteria using confocal microscopy.

Overview
Aiming at designing an effective, convenient and cheap device to detect ammonia for fish farmers, we believe that our device has the potential to be applied in the real ponds and reach commercial success. The following is a summary of our work on entrepreneurship, including the discussion on product application, market analysis and financial summary.
Product Application
Since a patent is needed if we want to apply our device on real ponds, we went to the department of transformation of scientific and technological achievements in Institute of Biophysics, and asked for advice. During the communication with the staff there, we learned about the process of applying a patent and noted significant issues. At present, we are planning to apply a patent for our designs after the project is finished.
Market Analysis Summary
In China, freshwater aquaculture is the most important production method in the fishery industries. Among all aquaculture modes, ponds account for over 75% of the product. Nevertheless, few farming ponds in China are equipped with ammonia monitoring and water purification systems, causing pollution and fish diseases and reduced aquaculture production.
We compared our designs with other methods on the market which are widely used currently, and find our designs having the obvious advantages such as cheaper, cleaner and more convenient.

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Contribution_-_-_TEXT.html," to work well and we successfully detected considerable amount of uric acid in the culture medium our bacteria bred in. we also improved our project by adding ssrA tag to the RFP our detecting bacteria express and transform enzymes into degrading bacteria that enhance the produce of uric acid.
For convenient detection of ammonia nitrogen in fishponds, a device was designed based upon our sensor bacteria, which express RFP in low ammonia concentration water. The device is able to provide relatively accurate information while the cost is lower than most ammonia detection equipment on the market. The user only needs to fix our equipment on a buoy or a platform, and to purify the water when receiving the text message that the device automatically sends to him/her.
Demand
As we have demonstrated, excessive ammonia in the fish pond is one of the main problems that limited the development of fresh water aquaculture. Excessive ammonia will lead to the deterioration of water quality and effect the taste of the fish. It will also lead to the outbreak of fish diseases and cause fish death, heavily decreasing the yield of the fish pond. If we cannot solve the problem of excessive ammonia, it will be problematic to increase the breeding density and to improve the fish quality, thus effecting the income of fish farmers.
So essential as the problem of excessive ammonia is, there are certain solutions fish farmers will apply empirically. During the high-risk period, fish farmers will frequently visit their ponds and observe the water quality and fish conditions. Once there is any manifestation indicting excessive ammonia or fish diseases, they will take emergency measures such as disinfecting the pond and changing pond water.
Given the fact that fish farmers are judging by virtue of experience, there will always be deviation. When any manifestation occurs, excessive ammonia has actually erupted already. Although there are some products of ammonia detection on the market, they are either too expensive for fish farmers to afford or inconvenient to use (See more details on products comparison in entrepreneurship ). In addition, they measures they usually take to deal with excessive ammonia are either too expensive or too troublesome. According to our research (See more details on Integrated HP), big aquaculture companies usually choose running water to breed fish, which, in places lack of surface water, will cost up to 200 thousand yuan per month and waste thousands tons of underground water. Self-employed fish pond tend to choose chemical agents to remove ammonia, but this method is not efficient enough and is not eco-friendly.
Therefore, an effective, convenient and cheap way to detect and degrade ammonia is in strong demand of fish farmers.

Based on the principle of efficiency, convenience and economy, we designed"

Incorporating New Communities
As synthetic biology continues to expand, it is becoming increasingly important to incorporate more disciplines into our field. This year, our team worked to build new connections with seven distinct populations who play an important role in research and implementation of synthetic biology projects.
Retirement Communities
The 60+ population can’t always attend our public forums, but they still vote on and are impacted by our research. This year, we met with over 50 retirees to discuss the ethics and applications of synthetic biology.

Future Policy Makers
Model United Nations
Global and domestic policy determine which bioengineering projects get implemented outside of the lab. To help start the discussion of synthetic biology in the next generation of policy makers, we connected with 150+ High School Model United Nations Students.

Business Students
Having business partnerships is crucial in promoting bioengineering projects to the public. This year, we connected with 21 business students to promote future collaborations between STEM and entrepreneurship.

Young Women in STEM
Our team wanted to inspire more young women to join STEM fields. To this end, we partnered with Classical Academy Homeschooling Cohort and the Girl Scouts of the Colonial Coast to create Ladies in the Lab. The event hosted 28 girls in October and will host 100+ more in November.

Established Women
Supporting STEM
Our efforts to engage women in STEM continued during William & Mary’s Women Weekend. We presented a poster during the weekend; 100+ women came to view our poster and more than 20 women had in depth conversations with our female team members about our project.

XMU_Software,2013,Team:XMU Software#Outreach_-_-_TEXT.html,"2013 from 2 pm to 5 pm oriented to the high school students in the summer camp.
Theme show of synthetic biology was the first section of the party. We introduced the basic conceptions of synthetic biology, its safety issues, as well as iGEM competition to our high school the audience systematically. The attractive presentation won enthusiastic acclaim from the audience as well as a bunch of feedbacks. In the same time, we emphasized the security of synthetic biology and our software again in this introduction. We all believed that the security policy was the cardinal and fundamental thing of iGEM.
The second section of our party was the game which included lantern riddles, finding differences in DNA, Fold-it, and Biological-Sha.
Guessing the lantern riddles was a traditional Chinese game. We handed out some synthetic biology riddles designed for biology education specifically. For example, one of riddles describted the question as 'the bottle which is full of alcohol, not used to light.', and the answer corresponded to an alcohol lamp. Besides, some riddles were about security facilities in labs. We prepared many gifts for students who got the correct answers and tried to recall their memory that we introduce in the first section by this method.
Another game, Finding Differences in DNA, was a challenging game which required both perspicacity and memory. The object of this game was finding out all the tiny differences in a set of DNA pictures as soon as possible. Hard though it seemed, a whole bunch of high school students showed great interest in it. In the meanwhile, the procedure of finding differences helped them to familiarize with DNA sequences.
The high school students were guessing the riddles Finding differences in DNA
Fold-it was a computer game in which you can see the structure of a certain protein and fold it in order to make it to achieve the most stable state. The score of this game was measured by the stability of the protein. (link: ) We deem Fold-it a great approach to reverse the current trend that so many high school students were increasingly addicted to electronic games toward a better direction that games can also serve as a vehicle for imparting knowledge. Students could have fun while learning the determining factors of the stability of proteins.

The last but not least game was Synthetic-biology-sha, which was redesigned by us based on an extremely popular card game Sanguosha. The card in this game, for instance Bacterial Quorum Sensing card, was designed on the basis of theory of synthetic biology. While enjoying this card game"

AND GATE-input
This is the input part of AND GATE. After being induced by IPTG, plac promoter activates the expression of T7 RNA polymerase which contains two  amber mutations (T7 ptag) . After being induced by L-arabinose, pBAD promoter activates the expression of a special tRNA (supD), which is used to identify amber mutation. In the wild-type E.coli, amber mutation will inhibit the translation of T7 RNA polymerase. Therefore, only when the two inputs exist together, T7 RNA polymerase can be expressed, and then T7 promoter can be activated to express the downstream gene.

Mais ceci n’est pas vrai, ou du moins uniquement en mono-injection, les PEG, comme toutes autres molécules de furtivité, offre un épitope accessible aux anticorps et autres opsonines du corps. Ainsi, lors de la seconde injection, une réponse du système immunitaire s’organise et la clairance est accélérée, réduisant considérablement l’efficacité thérapeutique.
Cependant, les vecteurs reconnus par les opsonines et non dégradés sont adsorbés par les macrophages du système hépatosplénique (foie et rate), ainsi il est très facile avec cette technologie de cibler des physiopathologies du foie et de la rate. Car c’est tout naturellement, via les macrophages hépatiques et spléniques, que l’organisme va concentrer la dose de médicaments « vectorisés » au sein de ces deux organes.
L’industrialisation est une problématique d’un autre ordre. Elle reste cependant essentielle à maîtriser. Bon nombre de technologies révolutionnaire n’ont jamais abouties en raison d’une incapacité à être transposé à l’échelle industrielle. Cela peut être le cas pour certains types de vecteurs. Hormis les vecteurs de type procaryote, le coût de production d’un vecteur est très élevé à l’heure actuelle. C’est d’autant plus vrai dans le cas des vecteurs viraux qui doivent être produits par des cellules eucaryotes, ce qui semble être un frein énorme à leur commercialisation. Pour ce qui est des nanoparticules, le prix est pour l’instant élevé mais cependant certains produits, à tropisme hépatosplénique, sont tout de même sur le marché. En revanche, la fabrication de vecteurs plus complexes, nécessitant plus de composants, de nombreuses étapes de conception et l’utilisation de solvant organique a un coût de production encore très élevé.

Both Darwin's theory of evolution and Copernicus' heliocentric theory had impacted people's ideas at that time. Finally, science changed people's ideas and brought huge benefits to people's understanding of nature and social progress without insupportable harm. There is little moral recrimination from religious or non-religious ethicists, the bioethics commission reports. Other scholars assert that rational people would be inclined to accept synthetic life morally without more radical religious feelings. Such ethical norms do not hinder scientific development. Instead, they aim to minimize risks and maximize benefits, respect subjects and patients, distribute benefits and burdens fairly, and protect the environment. Following ethical norms will reduce adverse events in scientific research and application, avoid risks, and in the long run, promote healthy development of science. All ethical norms cannot be rejected because some of them remain controversial. Synthetic life technology is related to multiple interests, and it is inevitable to have transcendence and controversy. Unlike easily quantifiable technical standards, the risks and benefits of synthetic biology research and application are diverse and difficult to be accurately assessed."

Ellie Boardman
Ellie is a 4th year MSci Hons Biochemistry and Genetics student. Although her passion in science lies a way away from synthetic biology, in microbial pathogenesis and infection, she thought iGEM would be a fantastic way to broaden her skills and knowledge as she wants to follow a career in scientific research.
“iGEM has been an incredible experience which has taught me a huge variety of things, including the patience needed for molecular biology lab work! Outside of the lab, I am teaching myself piano and how to use Python. I have great fun trying (and failing miserably) to “talk computer” with Vik, our computer scientist, however it is definitely a weak area of mine and iGEM has given me opportunities to learn new things from people who I would never normally come across in my day to day life. iGEM has really advanced me as a scientist, more than I ever thought it could! I really look forward to meeting everyone and presenting the research our wonderful team has done at the jamboree in Boston in November. See you all there!”

Biologia syntetyczna ma moc zmieniania paradygmatów społecznych takich jak nasza koncepcja tego, czym są organizmy żywe. Jeśli pozbawimy bakterie ich „niepotrzebnych” funkcji i zmusimy je do produkcji tego, co nam potrzebne, czy nadal będą one posiadały status organizmów żywych czy staną się maszynami?
Aby odpowiedzieć na to pytanie, przyjęliśmy podejście artystyczne, jako że Bio-Art jest jednym z najlepszych sposobów wskrzeszenia debaty wśród społeczeństwa. Stworzyliśmy koncepcję organizmu, która odzwierciedlałaby te dochodzenia. Zmodyfikowaliśmy Escherichia coli by wytwarzała zapach i imitowała proces dojrzewania cytryny. Mieszanina bakterii i pożywki odżywczej zostanie ukształtowana: będzie pachnieć, dojrzewać i wyglądać jak cytryna, ale ""ceci n’est pas un citron” – to nie cytryna… a może jednak? Wraz z tym pytaniem zapraszamy wszystkich do rozważenia przyszłych okazji i granic etycznych projektowania żyw"

Introduction
In our project, we eliminate algal bloom by designing E. coli to secrete proteins that can lyse the   cyanobacteria. To make our project feasible in future applications, we have to find ways to enhance the killing   effect. As our model indicates, binding our E. coli to the cyanobacteria can help us achieve this goal. So we   searched for proteins that can bind to the targeted M. aeruginosa cells and we chose to work with microvirin   (MVN), a mannan binding lectin in Microcystis aeruginosa PCC7806, since of its high specificity to the   cyanobacteria and its availability to our E. coli. Microvirin is a protein consisting of 108 amino acid   residues and it has one mannan binding site which can bind to the LPS of the M. aeruginosa cells [1] . In our project, MVN was displayed on the surface of E. coli cells using a kind of truncated INP   (INPNC). By this way, we could bind our E. coli to M. aeruginosa and thus help us increase the overall   killing effect.
However, cyanobacteria are usually floating in the surface water due to its gas vesicles and colony formation in   the field. So we also equipped our cells with gas vesicles to deal with the problem that E. coli cells mostly sink to the bottom when put into water. This will increase the opportunity for an E. coli cell to approach a   cyanobacteria cell and enhance the killing effect too.
Design
To make our genetically engineered E. coli bind to Microcystis aeruginosa, we used a kind of   truncated Ice Nucleation Protein (INPNC) to display microvirin (MVN) on the surface of our E. coli. We also   used GFP as a reporter to make the binding effect ""visible"".

IISER-Bhopal-India,2018,Team:IISER-Bhopal-India#Improve_-_-_TEXT.html," P. pastoris. These three proteins are subunits of the enzyme methane monooxygenase which converts methane into methanol. The expression is driven by the strong constitutive GAP promoter from P. pastoris and ends with the AOX terminator from P. pastoris. The three genes are linked together with viral peptide P2A sequences and hence, their mRNA will be transcribed as a whole but during translation, they will form individual polypeptides due to ribosome skipping a peptide bond between the proline and glycine residue at the C-terminus of the viral 2A peptide. This construct drastically reduces the expression cassette size since each of the genes need not be flanked by its own promoter and terminator but can be controlled by a single promoter similar to a prokaryotic operon. Also, the order of the genes in the construct does not matter since the 2A peptides would give a similar expression for the three proteins. In total, this part provides an expression cassette for the constitutive expression of three sMMO subunits codon optimized for P. pastoris but can also be expressed in S. cereviseae.

BBa_K2790006 (sMMO D-AoxPromoter-iLOV)
The submitted part Bba_K2790006 is a 3A assembly of smmoD gene flanked by a eukaryotic promoter and a promoter-reporter (AOX promoter-iLOV) construct. Amplification of the latter can be done by specific primers for AOX promoter-iLOV construct and the amplicon can be cloned into desired vectors. The AOX-iLOV is an improvement over the AOX promoter-RFP construct as iLOV is a better fluorescence protein than RFP or GFP as shown already in characterization by Team Exeter in 2014. The key points which make AOX promoter-iLOV an improvement over AOX promoter-RFP are:
Half the size of GFP
Faster maturation
Stable over a wide pH range
Spontaneous recovery after Photobleaching
Ability to work in Anoxic conditions
Higher Fluorescent intensities

SDU-Denmark,2017,Team:SDU-Denmark#HP#Gold Integrated_-_-_TEXT.html," of the Bolbro’s city renewal project called Mit Bolbro i.e. My Bolbro. We arranged a meeting with her with the intent of further investigating how the PowerLeaf could and should be integrated in an urban area of Odense, in this case the neighbourhood of Bolbro.
Bolbro is an old neighbourhood in Odense historically known to be the home of the working class. While Bolbro provides a homely atmosphere known to the locals, it has had a hard time attracting new residents. However, this is subject to change as the neighbourhood in 2016 received approximately 1.6 million US dollars to renew its city space and to create an even more appealing, and vibrant neighbourhood. This will be achieved by including the locals, as Bolbro is characterized by having a strong, engaging civil society. Mrs. Mortensen is not only an expert in urban renewal, but also in how to include local citizens in reshaping the public space in which they reside.
Mrs. Mortensen also argued that a changeable design would be the optimal solution to fit the challenges one faces in creating a vibrant, green city ambience. Such a task depends on different preferences, laws and needs. A technology needs to be both flexible and accessible to successfully contribute to the process of creating an engaging city environment. She showed great interest in our device and even offered to implement it in the parks of Bolbro, should the product become a reality.
We had a discussion with Mrs. Mortensen about the creation of a prototype based on the wishes of Bolbro’s local citizens. Following this conversation, she provided us with a pitch that aimed to help us develop this prototype.
“Hauge’s square is a spot in Bolbro, which we aim to make a central place in Bolbro; a place that invites the citizen to meet and dwell. Your solution should be able to contribute to help citizens recharge their phones, e.g. a solution could be implanting the PowerLeaf into a interactive furniture, but where the demand an aesthetic pleasing design still remains.”
“A part of the vision of this project is the concept of making a pop-up park with differently designed multi-furniture, preferably in wood and organic design, which are removable to the various areas where we are going to develop in the district. It is furniture that should be able to be used to relax in and at the same time also motivates children to move. There is also a need for charging devices and it therefore demands that your solution is an integrated, but still mobile solution, as the park will move physically over time. Finally, the playground is to be developed especially for the young audience"
Hong_Kong_HKU,2018,Team:Hong Kong HKUST#Description Laccase_-_-_TEXT.html," a terminal oxygen reducing site. Laccases were long reported to be present in some lignin- bio-degrading fungi, where they catalyse the oxidation, including carbonyl formation, of aromatic compounds. Nonetheless, there is considerable evidence showing laccase’s affinity to non-aromatic substrates, such as saturated hydrocarbons.
 
Due to the lack of any hydrolysable functional group, a specific enzymatic attack on the PE backbone may not be favourable; however, a random oxidation on PE could effectively weaken its chemical integrity. Presently, the activity of laccase on PE has been confirmed by documented cases from scientific research papers as well as from past iGEM projects. For instance, University London College IGEM team 2012 proposed that the laccase could lead to increased deterioration of polyethylene structure and was confirmed by the SEM (Scanning Electron Microscope) which showed an evident scratch made on a PE film surface after incubation with laccase, compared to the control. Moreover, in research conducted by other teams, crude laccase secreted by rhodococcus ruber was incubated with LDPE of average molecular weight 191,000. It reportedly resulted in 15 to 20 percent of mass reduction over a period of two weeks, which demonstrated the feasibility of laccase-degradation of polyethylene. To further enhance the efficiency of laccase, introduction of copper ions and mediators to the reaction medium were also justified to yield a higher degradation rate ([3], [5]) .
 
The target of this module was to demonstrate the ability of Laccase, expressed by E.coli, to fragment PE into simple hydrocarbons. For the purpose of utilizing laccase in the outer-membrane space, outer membrane protein A (OmpA)  is required to serve as a protein signal to the membrane so that the laccase can be dumped to the intracellular space. Meanwhile, to minimise the misfolding of laccase with OmpA, our chosen OmpA includes a linker sequence at the N-termini to separate laccase from the signalling protein OmpA. To aid in protein extraction for characterization, a 6X his-tag region is added to all of our laccase. The final effective construct for activity assay is as follows:
 
 
Apart from the construct above, another construct was also involved to characterize the effectiveness of OmpA in bringing out laccase to the intracellular space.
With these two constructs constitutively expressed in E.coli, it is expected that we can compare"

Plan: Finish EPF-Lausanne database, finish E.coli oscillator database, update DB document. Settle the DB format for good(hopefully). Summary: As our simulation program becomes more and more mature, we encounter more problems in consistency of our database. We all want to make major changes and make it right this time, but sadly we don’t have the time. So we make minor changes, add patches to fix the bugs, but we have to let go of the unconsistency in substituent, compartment and other places. Now the DB looks not beautiful or elegant, but usable. This is good enough since our first goal now is to make our software work, and a DB that can properly describe simple reaction networks should be enough. We plan to leave major changes to further development. Most of our team members work intensively during the 7 days off, and the achievement of their work is rich. DB of both EFP-Lausanne and Synchronized Ecoli are basically finished. Tables and graphs on DB structure has been published. Our software core seems finally begin to function right. UI is under constructing. All the codes are now on github. We schedule our trip and book plane tickets to Beijing, Chicago and Boston. Jue Wang is now in charge of money and team wear. We dined together on Oct 1, but without a relaxed mind, it was not fun for me. What actually thrills me up is to"
UCL,2014,Team:UCLA#Project#Spinning Silk_-_-_TEXT.html," mixture to solidify into a gel.   We have put together our syringe pump extrusion setup based on published protocols.  As an alternative, we came up with idea of extruding our silk via centrifugation.  We designed and 3d printed a column with a small opening at the bottom that could hold liquid and extrude it when placed in a falcon tube in the centrifuge. Although we have not yet attempted to spin a silk fiber, we have spun  fibers from solubilized cellulose acetate using both our syringe pump setup as well as our centrifuge extrusion set up.  We have lyophilized our dialyzed silk product, and are ready to resuspend this in HFIP solvent and spin it.  As soon as we have mastered either the syringe or centrifuge extrusion techniques, we will be ready to produce a fiber from our Bombyx mori silk proteins.

To provide a positive control, the CDS of EGFP from pEGFP-N1 (Clontech) was inserted downstream and in frame with the CDS of the MLS in the commercial plasmid pCMV/myc/mito (Invitrogen, Carlsbard, CA). Our negative control construct was the same as our experimental construct, but minus the MLS CDS. ( BBa_K1119008 ).
The detailed protocols employed for our characterization work can be accessed via the link.
Cell Culture and Transfection
The three constructs were transfected separately into different batches of HEK293FT cells. The protocol for culturing HEK293FT cells was based on American Type Culture Collection resources. The culture medium used was DMEM with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. For the transfection, we followed the general procedure outlined by Invitrogen LipofectamineTM 2000. Serum-free and antibiotics-free DMEM was used to form DNA-lipofectamine complexes.
Stain with MitoTracker® Dye
In order to test the efficiency of MLS, we need to identify the location of mitochondria. Therefore, rosamine-based MitoTracker® Red CMXRos (Invitrogen, Carlsbard, CA), a red-fluorescent dye, was used to stain the mitochondria in live cells. It can accumulate due to the membrane potential of mitochondria. According to the manual, this dye can be well resolved from the green fluorescence of other probes so it won’t affect the observation of the expression of green fluorescence protein. The protocol we used for staining is from MitoTracker® Mitochondrion-Selective Probes. The working concentration of staining solution made was 0.2μM and the incubation time after staining was 15 minutes.

Since the EGFP, GFP and MitoTracker® Red CMXRos can all be observed under fluorescent microscope, we did fluorescent microscopy in order to obtain results. We observed the transfected cells under confocal microscope.
Data Processing
To quantify the amount of signal overlapped between the GFP signal and the MitoTracker® dye, we adopted the method described by A.P. French et al. in “Colocalization of fluorescent markers in confocal microscope images of plant cells” (French et al., 2008). With the use of the Pearson-Spearman correlation colocalization plugin for ImageJ image processing, scatter plots of the green intensities (y-axis) and red intensities"

Welcome
Welcome to iGEM E 2012 at UC Davis!
This year's UC Davis team is composed of ten undergraduates, two advisors, and a graduate student. We come from different areas of study, but we're all working together on this year's synthetic biology project. Due to the global impact of plastic pollution, we have decided to focus on biodegradation of polyethylene terephthalate (PET). PET is a commonly and widely used plastic, but only a small percentage of them are recycled, meaning a majority of the trash ends up in landfills and the oceans. It is a global issue, and achieving our goal would have a big impact on the issue of plastic degradation.
Our Project/Abstract
We hope to accomplish:
This year, our team hopes to successfully insert the gene for cutinase, an enzyme that has been shown to degrade polyethylene terephthalate (PET), into several strains of E. coli. PET is a major kind of plastic used today, and we hope to overproduce cutinase within the E. coli and secrete the enzyme into the extracellular region to degrade the PET. We hope to test the cutinase out on several kinds of PET, such as films from scientific companies and plastic bottles, and test how much each is broken down. We also hope to improve the cutinase itself through targeted mutations and codon optimization, through programs such as Foldit and SWISS- MODEL.
Through our research, we have learned that with cutinase, PET degrades into terephthalic acid (TPA) and ethylene glycol. While TPA does not appear to be harmful, ethylene glycol is a toxic substance. We hope to degrade ethylene glycol as much as possible by enhancing the promoters that express the degradative enzymes involved. After ethylene glycol is degraded, we hope to redirect all further byproducts into glycolysis within E. coli so that the project would sustain itself. We also hope to"

Where  n= 6 (points used to fit line) and x ̅ is the mean of the sample.
Average rate = 0.0087
Standard deviation = 4.39e-4
Standard error of the mean = 8.78e-5
Discussion and conclusion
We can see that for this range of values, the standard deviation is very small. This means that in the exponential phase, growth rate of the culture does not vary significantly. Furthermore, different initial concentrations of glucose do not have an effect on the time taken for the population to saturate so there are no delays in the encapsulation process for different glucose concentrations.
This means that both hypotheses are ruled out: Regardless of initial concentrations of glucose present in the medium, bacterial growth starts off at the same initial rate. Depending on the amount of resources present, the bacteria will compensate by entering a “low consumption mode” and saturating the population at a lower level. However, no matter what the initial concentration of glucose, this always happens at the same time.
Therefore, we conclude that different initial concentrations of glucose in the medium do not affect the start of the encapsulation process.

Paris_Saclay,2014,Team:Paris Saclay#Ethics#Round Table_-_-_TEXT.html," the decision and should be very well questioned. After all, it is the artist’s choice and they should justify their choice to use living beings in their work.  But the distinction between plants and animals is not really based or justified because the only fundamental thing that differentiates is the cell structure. We took for example the sea anemone. Conceptually, many people associate the anemone with a plant because, it’s very far from the definition of an animal, yet it is a member of the animal kingdom. So for this question, we concluded that what distinguishes two living organisms is intelligence which is why humans are more disturbed by the killing/genetic modification of a mouse than of bacteria, a plant or an anemone. Man will have more qualms about manipulating a being with whom he interacts.
Ethics
Some artists use this new concept to denounce the use of transgenic organisms. We strongly believe that it is a huge paradox to denounce the use of transgenic methods by using transgenic organisms themselves.
Bio-art is a useful tool to show our thoughts but we should not forget the limits we defined. It may also be an issue because some people who are not familiar with biology could be afraid of genetic manipulation. We believe that humans always try to innovate and this innovation with biological material may be dangerous.
Some skeptics of contemporary art raise issues about the current experimentation on living beings and its “normalization”. Bio-art may be part of this fear because it opens a huge window to a world we do not know yet. However, Bio-art raises all these questions and make people aware about these current issues. Indeed, interest about biology has increased since the creation of Bio-art.
However, scientists and artists are very different because they have different backgrounds and views on biology and more precisely about safety.
Bio-art is a new tool for artistic communication and it allows to show an innovative science.
Bio-art may be considered as a new step in the future of art that will shake pre-existing foundations.

These results show that the green fluorescent protein assembled downstream of the genetic circuit is correctly folded.

The following day cultures were diluted 1:100 and let grow again for about five hours at 37°C, 220 rpm.
The optical density (O.D.) of each culture was than measured with TECAN Infinte F200. Samples were diluted in order to obtain the same O.D. equal to 0.02.
Then we performed a 21-hour experiment with measurements of absorbance and green fluorescence every five minutes using TECAN Infinite F200; cultures were shaken for 15 seconds every five minutes. <partinfo>BBa_K300091</partinfo> and <partinfo>BBa_K300092</partinfo> constructs were induced with 100nM of HSL directly in the 96-well microplate.  Acquired data were blanked by subtracting the media absorbance (for absorbance measurements) and the <partinfo>BBa_B0031</partinfo> fluorescence (for fluorescence measurements). Then, the relative GFP synthesis rate per cell was evaluated by computing (1/O.D.600)*dGFP/dt, where O.D.600 is the blanked absorb"

Braunschweig,2014,Team:Braunschweig#Project-content_-_-_TEXT.html," of the matrix which depends on the matrix material itself and partially also on the immobilization procedure, but this cut-off is much higher than the molecular weight of fatty acids.
However, the extent of inhibition may be reduced by two facts:
- If a concentration gradient of the fatty acids is built up inside the immobilization matrix. The prerequisite for that is that the inhibitory fatty acids must be removed or digested inside the beads. If, for example, the cells were able to digest the fatty acids faster than they diffuse through the matrix, a high, inhibitory concentration would be avoided.
- If the diffusion coefficient of the inhibitory compounds in the matrix is reduced. This might be achieved by using a hydrophilic matrix material in which more hydrophobic compounds like fatty acids cannot diffuse so easily.
2. Which kind of immobilization would you recommend for our project considering the rumen as milieu?
The rumen is a very complex milieu so that it is not easy to predict how immobilisates will behave. A synthetic matrix material like polyvinylalcohol cannot be digested and would be stable in the rumen but will end up in the manure and later on somewhere in the environment. This wouldn’t be a good idea. Therefore, a natural biodegradable material like alginate or carrageenan should be preferred. As these materials consist of natural polysaccharides, they might be degraded by the enzymes in the rumen. How fast this will occur needs to be checked.
3. Is the production of alginate, beads expensive or difficult?
Of course, there are additional costs for the immobilization procedure, but those are in general not too high. It is always a question whether the benefit of immobilization is higher than its costs. This cannot generally be answered but has to be checked from case to case. Immobilization in alginate isn’t difficult at all. You just need an alginate solution with the cells and drop it e.g. with a syringe into another solution containing calcium ions, e.g. CaCl2 or Ca-lactate, leading immediately to Ca-alginate beads. (Calcium acts as a crosslinker for the alginate chains.) It’s so easy that anyone can do it, even in their own kitchen. In fact, similar procedures using alginate are part of the modern molecular cuisine offered in restaurants.
4. How much alginate is contained in the alginate beads?
This depends on the alginate type which is used, i.e. its molecular weight and thus its viscosity in a solution. Typically, a 1 – 4 wt.% alg"

Bead experiment 1
The bead we had focused on overnight (see 22 July 2008 ) had gone!! There were observed lots of beads clumping together, areas of dead/non-motile bacteria and also filamentous bacteria (possible conaminant). There were also areas of still motile bacteria.  The bacteria had travelled 40 % of way across bridge, thus a smaller bridge was suggested.

The experiment from 21 July 2008 was repeated. The aspartate solution was added eigth hours before the inoculation. The Results for showed that both strains were actually repelled by aspartate, possibly because the concentration was too high. Aspartate is the well on the right, and the control (water) is on the left.

BioBrick Transformation
Last Thursday, the primers VF2 and VR arrived. These primers allow a confirmation of a succesful transformation of most BioBrick parts by means of PCR. The resulting fragment length depends on the specific BioBrick DNA.
Using VF2 and VR, a colony PCR are was conducted with all colonies that were obtained with chemical competent cells so far. Two colonies with the yeast ADH1 promoter (No. 1 and 2, see left photo) and three colonies with a GFP generator (No. 3-5, see left photo) were identified as positive. Thus, all colonies are positive, but the transformation efficiency is too low, since the result was only one or zero colonies per transformation attempt.
Electroporation should give higher efficiencies. An attempt with a new BioBrick ( ADH1 terminator ) resulted in 69 colonies! Ten of them were analysed using PCR. The resulting fragment should have a length of 461 bp, but from the eigth positive colonies fragments between 650-750 bp were obtained (see right photo). This is probably due to a mutation which might result in a different binding location for one of the primers. Another explanation might be that the denoted length is wrong."

This year, the communication and cooperation between the two teams are the most comprehensive and in-depth since two teams participated in iGEM, aiming at realizing the goal of working together for better results.
Human Practice Union[Collapse]
Fig.11 The global iGEM Human Practice Union
This year, we led a global iGEM Human Practice Union with other three teams: BIT, CUHK and CGU. We finally cooperated with other 10 teams from Europe, Asia and South America.
This Union mainly has two purposes: the first is to combine with iGEMers all over the world and spread knowledge of synthetic biology. The second is to build up a database which can supplement the existed iGEM database and make it more convenient for iGEMers’ online communication around the world.
However, it is the first year of this union and the time is limited, we firstly made a questionnaire about synthetic biology and"

Each team will make new parts during iGEM and will submit them to the Registry of Standard Biological Parts. The iGEM software provides an easy way to present the parts your team has created. The <groupparts> tag (see below) will generate a table with all of the parts that your team adds to your team sandbox.
Remember that the goal of proper part documentation is to describe and define a part, so that it can be used without needing to refer to the primary literature. Registry users in future years should be able to read your documentation and be able to use the part successfully. Also, you should provide proper references to acknowledge previous authors and to provide for users who wish to know more.
Note
Note that parts must be documented on the Registry . This page serves to showcase the parts you have made. Future teams and other users and are much more likely to find parts by looking in the Registry than by looking at your team wiki.
Adding parts to the registry
You can add parts to the Registry at our Add a Part to the Registry link.
We encourage teams to start completing documentation for their parts on the Registry as soon as you have it available. The sooner you put up your parts, the better you will remember all the details about your parts. Remember, you don't need to send us the DNA sample before you create an entry for a part on the Registry. (However, you do need to send us the DNA sample before the Jamboree. If you don't send us a DNA sample of a part, that part will not be eligible for awards and medal criteria.)
What information do I need to start putting my parts on the Registry?
The information needed to initially create a part on the Registry is:
Part Name
Part type
Creator
Sequence
Short Description (60 characters on what the DNA does)
Long Description (Longer description of what the DNA does)

We encourage you to put up much more information as you gather it over the summer. If you have images, plots"
Calgary,2013,Team:Calgary#Sandbox#Notebook#Journal#Linker_-_-_TEXT.html," lysine residue that limit the binding to the formation of coil heterodimers.
Figure 1. A helical wheel representation of the IAAL E3/K3 coiled-coil heterodimer viewed as a cross-section based off of a similar figure created by Litowski and Hodges (2002). The peptide chain propagates into the page from the N to the C terminus. Hydrophobic interactions between the coils are indicated by the clear wide arrows. The intermolecular electrostatic interactions between the coils are displayed by the thin curved arrow (eg. Between Glu15 and Lys20).
Based off of results from previous ferritin fusions (Kim et al., 2011) it was decided that a linker sequence was needed between the coils and their respective proteins to prevent any steric hindrance due to the size of the ferritin and TALE proteins. A flexible glycine rich linker lacking protease cut sites was selected from the registry ( BBa_K157013 )
Week 5: May 27 - May 31
We continued to perform literature searches this week for our project. This week our main focus was on determining ways we could characterize our coils and finding additional useful properties of coils. Many papers make use of circular dichroism in order to detect if the coils are able to bind to each other.  This technique requires the use of a spectropolarimeter and a fair amount of knowledge to complete so it may not be the most ideal technique in our situation given the timelines we are working on. Another option consists of using FRET (Förster resonance energy transfer) to measure the binding of the coils. The idea is to have an individual fluorophore attached to each coil so that when the coils are bound the process of FRET can occur and light emission will be observed from the fluorescent protein that is having energy being transferred to it from the other fluorescent protein (Apostolovic and Klok, 2008). This technique can be difficult to perform however so it will likely be maintained as a backup characterization technique.
One interesting properties of coils is that they are sensitive to acidic pH levels (Apostolovic and Klok, 2008). This warrants examination once we have our coils complete and purified as a protein as this pH sensitivity could be problematic for our system or it may act as a benefit.
Week 6: June 3 - June 7
Based on the research we have done in the previous weeks we have decided to plot out some experiments that will help us characterize our coils. We plan make use of a Ni-NTA column and His-tags"
USTC,2010,Team:USTC Software#dev_-_-_TEXT.html," with repressor or inducer. So its properties are changed, and it is not the original promoter any more. This is an example where binding changes the properties of node. Since we do not store all the possible property alterations within one part, the solution is to replace the old part with a new part that stores the correct properties.
Available nodes can be both a part on a chain or a node of binding site, which leaves a lot of possibilities in constructing complicated binding structure. Again, there are no restrictions, but parts of compartments are not suggested to appear in a binding structure.
The Basic Assumption
The basic assumption of Chain-Node Model is that a part ALWAYS carries its properties wherever it is placed in an instance of Chain-Node Model. This means no matter how complicated the complex is, you can always keep track of the location and properties of every single part. By letting complex inherits its parts’ properties, the assumption saves modelers from rewriting the structure and function of each new complex. However, we should address that the assumption is not suitable for all circumstances. For example, under this assumption, a fusion protein will carry the properties of the fused proteins, which is not true in many cases. A fusion protein may not remain its old properties and even have new properties that none of the original parts have. In this case, our suggestion is to define the fusion protein as a new part. So it is suggested that users choose different strategies of describing the same thing in Chain-Node Model base on different situations, instead of modeling everything in the same way.
Examples
With great power there must come great responsibility. In order to use the powerful Chain-Node Model correctly, please have a look at a few examples we presents.
Example of a species: E.coli cell
In MoDeL, the cell of E.coli is described as a species with only one part of E.coli(see Figure 1). Since the concept of part has been extended greatly, living cells can be described in the same way other species. Compartment belongs to “Non-sequence”, so it is suggested that E.coli only exists as a one-part-species.

2018/8/18 & 2018/9/4 :
In September, we held a debate contest with Ming-Dao, arguing that ""synthetic biology is better for environmental improvement than harm"" and invited comments. In this debate, we choose to take turns to be both positive and negative. In addition to making the preparations more comprehensive, it also helps both of us understood the environmental ethic issue. Both of us agreed that synthetic biology could improve plants in certain extreme climates, but if used in the wrong place, synthetic biology will degenerate into merchants controlling the commodities of farmers in the arid regions, and even biochemical weapon. Thanks to Mingdao for providing venues that give us an opportunity to engage in a debate on synthetic biology."

The GFP expression levels were compared to a synthetic GFP construct in an E. coli chassis as a positive control and a non-fluorescing E. coli device as a negative control. The E. coli cells were grown in SOC media at a neutral pH over 24 hours at 220 rpm. Error bars represent standard error.
pH
The 5-alpha E.coli containing the Gibson Assembly construct which was grown in 37ᵒC SOC media at pH 9 had a higher final GFP expression than the 5-alpha grown at pH 7 or pH 5;  final the GFP expression of 5-alpha at pH 9 was 4.12x105 AFU/OD600 with the standard error of, 2.40x104 whereas the GFP expressions for 5-alpha grown at pH 7 and pH 5 were 4.08x104 AFU/OD600 with the standard error of 7.32x103 AFU/OD600 and 2.88x104 AFU/OD600 with the standard error of 4.27x103 AFU/OD600 respectively (Figure 2.3). There was a significant difference in mean GFP expression levels between 5-alpha grown at pH 5, 7 and 9 over the 24 hours (ANOVA, F2,72=49.88, p<0.001). A post hoc Tukey test indicated that there was no significant difference in the 5-alpha GFP expression between pH 5 and 7 (p>0.05) but 5-alpha at pH 9 had a significantly higher GFP expression than at the lower pHs (p<0.05).
Additionally, the 5-alpha E. coli grown in 37ᵒC LB media had a higher GFP expression at pH 9 than the 5-alpha grown in pH 5 and pH 7 LB media; the GFP expression at pH 9 was 9.13x105 AFU/OD600 with the standard error of 3.45x104 AFU/OD600 whereas the GFP expression at pH 5 and 7 in LB media were 6.38x105 AFU/OD600 with the standard error of 2.49x104 AFU/OD600 and 6.18x105 AFU/OD600 with the standard error of 1.68x104 AFU/OD600 respectively.

Aachen,2014,Team:Aachen#Parts_-_-_TEXT.html," A dark yellow fluorescent protein (YFP)-based Resonance Energy-Accepting Chromoprotein (REACh) for Förster resonance energy transfer with GFP. Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2006 Mar 14;103(11):4089-94. Epub 2006 Mar 6. PubMed PMID: 16537489; PubMed Central PMCID: PMC1449651. PubMed Central
Usage and Biology
This protein is designed to be a dark quencher for GFP ( E0040 ) in a FRET system. When used in a fusion protein with GFP it reduces the observed fluorescence of GFP drastically. In the biobrick K1319014 this is realized and the proteins are fused with the linker K1319016 which includes a specific TEV protease (available as K1319004 ) cleavage site. The fusion of the proteins brings GFP and REACh2 in proximity to each other which allows GFP and REACh2 to act as donors and acceptors in a FRET (Förster Energy Transfer System) system. GFPs emission energy is thereby taken up by REACh2 and released as thermal energy instead of visible light. This eliminates the GFP fluorescence and allows a release of a strong fluorescence signal if a TEV protease is expressed and the linker is cut. The cutting separates GFP and REACh2 cancelling the FRET interaction and providing a GFP fluorescence response.
Characterization
In order to characterize K1319002 it was expressed as a fusion protein together with GFP to show its quenching ability. This fusion protein, produced by K1319014, was located on the plasmid backbone pSB3K3. To show that the reduced fluorescence was due to the quenching ability of K1319002 and not based on a faulty expression, K1319008 was also introduced into the cells on a pSB1C3 backbone to allow for a double plasmid system. Both constructs were put into E. coli BL21 (DE3) and compared to I20260 and B0015 . B0015 was used as a negative control and I20260 was chosen as a positive control due to the expressed GFP being identical to the GFP being expressed in the fusion protein of K1319014 and having the same promoter, RBS, Terminator and plasmid backbone.
The double plasmid system, B0015 and I20260 were measured in biological triplicates and after 2 h one set of triplicates of each of the three systems were induced with 50 µ"

About the University
King's College Chapel,
University of Aberdeen
- Basil Spence
Founded in 1495 by William Elphinstone, Bishop of Aberdeen and Chancellor of Scotland, Aberdeen is Scotland's third oldest university, and the fifth most ancient in the whole United Kingdom.
Much of the original King's College still stands today, a famous historic landmark beloved of generations of students, academics, and local people who are inspired by the finest examples of medieval and Renaissance craftwork remaining anywhere in Scotland.
The department of Physics at the University of Aberdeen has a long and illustrious history, and former staff include great physicists such as James Clerk Maxwell.  The department is research-orientated, and does world-class research in both experimental and theoretical areas.  Research topics cover classical areas such as general relativity, solid-state physics and dynamical systems and chaos, and the department is also active in multi-disciplinary topics, especially the application of physics to biology.
Systems biology research at the University of Aberdeen is centred on a growing number of interdisciplinary interactions between biologists, physicists, computing scientists and engineers. This thriving network of collaborations is underpinned by significant Research Council funding. The research teams are focused on systems biological investigations at a variety of scales, from the molecular and cell level, to modelling of cells and tissues, whole populations and continent-wide environmental processes.
The application of mathematical and systems biology approaches, ranging from applied dynamics through stochastic to qualitative reasoning is enabling swift progress to be made in understanding complex biological, medical and environmental systems. The Systems Biology Research Programme is constantly seeking to broaden this portfolio by applying this powerful suite of approaches to new areas of investigation.

UCLA,2016,Team:UCLA#Protein Cages_-_-_TEXT.html," to incorporate a thrombin protease cleavage site onto the exterior of two different protein cage nanostructures and induce disassembly of these cages upon treatment with a thrombin protease. The results of our project demonstrate that mutations can be inserted into protein cages in order to modify them into potential targeted drug delivery vehicles. Future plans include loading these protein cages with various small molecules and assaying for exposure to the external environment upon cleavage and disassembly.
Cloning
All PCQuad and O3-33 wildtype and mutant protein cages were successfully cloned into psb1c3 vector as biobricks, sequence verified and submitted to the parts registry. As shown in Figure 1, the biobricks contain a T7 promoter, Ribosome Binding Site, sequence for an individual subunit of the specific cage, a 6x Histadine tag and a stop codon.
Figure 1. Sequence for PCQuad Mutant M1.
Expression and Purification
PCQuad and O3-33 Wild Type protein cage subunits were successfully expressed and purified; this was confirmed via SDS-PAGE.
Figure 2. SDS-PAGE for expression of PCQuad and O3-33 WildType Protein Cages.The size of a subunit of PCQuad is approximately 50 kDa and the size of a subunit of O3-33 is approximately 15 kDa.
PCQuad Mutant M1 and Mutant M13 subunits were successfully expressed and purified. PCQuad Mutant M2, Mutant M4 and Mutant M10 subunits were not able to be purified.
O3-33 Mutant aa88 subunit was successfully expressed and purified. O3-33 Mutant aa118 and Mutant aa173 subunits were not able to be purified.
Cage Formation
Dynamic light scattering was used to determine whether the expressed subunits self-assembled into the protein cage structure. A radius of around 8 nm is expected for PCQuad WIldType and its mutants and a radius of around 6.5 nm is expected for O3-33 and its mutants. A polydispersity reading below 30% is desired to ensure that our substance is pure and specific.

Jun 7: Research and birthday cake
After our meeting with Orit yesterday, all of today was dedicated to additional research and brainstorming on the electronic notebook. Luckily there was some additional excitement in the lab because it was Veronica’s birthday. We kind of ruined the surprise by accidentally ruined the surprise we were planning for here by including her in the email thread where we actually planned what we were going to do. Regardless, the celebration was fun. We had cake and cookies! Besides the birthday, I had periodic meetings with my electronic lab notebook “mini-team” to organize the topics we researched and discuss how to most efficiently represent the information we were researching for the rest of our labmates. We used Google documents and Dropbox to organize ourselves.
Jun 8: Work, Work, Work, and Chipotle!
Friday brought a much more relaxed attitude to the lab. Everyone was energetic and excited about the weekend. We all continued working on our specific projects but off-topic chatter was much higher today. At 12:30 pm, we all attended a group of talks by different computer science professors at Wellesley. We got to learn about a lot of cool projects that were going on in the computer science department this summer. After the talks, we all went to Chipotle Mexican Grill as a lab for lunch. It is tradition that every Friday, the lab goes out to lunch together which is nice. After lunch, my mini-team and I did additional research on the electronic notebook. We will be presenting our project to the rest of the lab next week so it was important that we be on top of our work. This is my first time participating in iGEM and have been having a little bit of trouble determining how extravagant I should be with my ideas. My labmates who have done iGEM before have helped me a bit with this problem by telling me that I should not limit any of my ideas (at least for the brainstorming phase…).
Jun 11: Project updates and my birthday!
Brainstorming for the ELN.
Today was a bit stressful. It was finally our time to present everything we had learned about the electronic lab notebook to the rest of the lab. My team spent the entire morning working to perfect our powerpoint presentation. We were the first to present today. It ended up being a lot less scary than I thought it would be. Everyone was very attentive during our presentation and provided a lot of useful commentary that made me think in ways I had not before. The new perspectives were extremely useful. Afterwards, I listened to the presentations"

If the cross-linked network has formed, it cannot be dissolved by the SU-8 developer. So, if we place a photo mask to shade the light shined on the photoresist, we can make a copy of the pattern on the photo mask. Both PDMS and glass contain silicon element. When they were treated by oxygen plasma, unstable hydroxyl group will form on the treated surface. When they get close enough, two hydroxyl groups will dehydrate and bond together covalently.

1) the negative control and
2) the ZifA + ZifA rpt that had been innoculated from the glycerol stock.
Gal tubes that lacked growth included:
pRS305 + pRS306
nullA + ZifA rpt
ZifA + ZifA rpt (both glycerol and colony)
ZifA -tag + ZifA rpt
Note: nullA + ZifA reporter may have been switched.  It is labeled as a dex tube but it might have actually contained galactose.  Be wary for results that would corroborate such a possibility.
The following glycerol stocks were made in duplicate (all duplicates from a single colony):

Took optical density readings using one plate reader and fluorescence measurements using another.  Also compared the optical densities with those taken using the Nanodrop.  However, the file of all Nanodrop ODs was closed before saving it.  What a stupid mistake!
Some notes about planning the colony PCR to verify these transformations:
First, note that the general procedure is to order primers that will give a PCR product of a known size if and only if the desired insert on the shuttle vector has been integrated into the yeast genome, indicative of a successful transformation.  Of course, the entire shuttle vector itself is integrated, so the primers will be designed using the provided sequences for the shuttle vectors.  The PCR product sizes will be predicted using the sequences of the parts in conjunction with those of the shuttle vectors.  Once colony PCR has been run, one then runs the products on a gel to determine if bands appear at the predicted"

Background
First Blood Experiment
Second Blood Experiment
Future Experiments
Background
The blood that we are using for our experiments in our wet lab was donated by a local butcher shop called The Mad Butcher and it was stored in 1 litre containers. Different amounts of the anticoagulant heparin were added to the containers. We added heparin because we didn’t want the blood to coagulate in the containers before we started to use it in experiments. We chose specifically to use heparin over other anti-coagulants because heparin combines with antithrombin-III which binds to thrombin to prevent thrombins action in the blood clotting cascade.
First Blood Experiment
For our first experiment with the blood, we added 10 mL of blood into 5 standard petri dishes. Two of the petri dishes acted as our negative controls, where there was nothing added to the blood. The results that we expected to see, was little to no clotting after 24 hours. We added 1.0 mL of our viper construct cells into our third dish, 1.5 mL to our fourth dish and then 2.0 mL to our fifth dish. We timed these dishes over the time span of 24 hours to see how much of the blood coagulated. The reason for this lab was to see how quickly the blood would clot naturally (without the addition of our construct) and the effect that our construct had on the blood (meaning, if it speed up the clotting time). The results of this experiment were that the petri dish that contained the 2.0 mL of our viper construct cells produced the largest clot followed by the dish that had 1.5 mL of our construct and then by the one that contained 1.0 mL of our construct. The controls of this experiment had very little of the blood clotted when 24 hours had passed. Because of these results we can infer that our viper construct cells do have a positive effect"

Calgary,2013,Team:Calgary Entrepreneurial#Project#Risk_-_-_TEXT.html," weaknesses. These include the primarily technology-focused background of our key members and the high costs that we will incur in bringing our first product to market. These weaknesses are things we need to remedy and constantly assess for risk. In terms of our overly technical backgrounds, we have brought on a dedicated advisory board in order to bridge some of the gaps in our knowledge and experience. In addition, in our management section , we have made a plan to bring in key players at critical times in the first years of operations in order to better fill some of the most important gaps. This is also reflected in our budget. In terms of our high requirement for finances, we have developed cost-effective options for producing our first product and have plans to cut costs should we need to, such as suspending future research and development activities.
Key Opportunities and Threats
Several key opportunities can also be seen in our SWOT analysis. These include the significant market opportunity we see in Alberta with the increased monitoring that has been mandated by the Alberta government, as well as the ability of our product to enter additional markets down the road. Opportunities are things that we need to prioritize or optimize. Based on the clear market opportunity, we are focusing our efforts on making this our first target market. As we develop our first generation product however, we will be optimizing our detector device for easy transitioning into a second market.
Finally, we need to consider threats, which are perhaps the most important component of this. For us, threats include the potential for a significant time for market for our first product and the potential for a competitor to enter the market. If we could not compete with this competitor, this could pose significant difficult for us in achieving our target market potential. As we are aiming to develop a lower-cost alternative to existing technologies already in the market, there is also the possibility that potential competitors would try to litigate us as they see us as serious competition. As an early-stage venture, this could pose serious risk to us. Threats need to be countered as they have the potential to critically disrupt our business. To this end, we have several strategies in place. If competitors offering significant advantages over us were to enter the market, we could again consider switching into an alternative target market. In terms of a possible litigation against us, we are actively ensuring that we protect ourselves legally and perform our due diligence. Finally, although our time to market for our first product is significant, by optimizing the design of our detector device and moving into research and development for future generation products while we bring our first product to market, we will ensure that subsequent products will have a much quicker development time.

LegoRoboBricks for Automated Biobrick DNA Assembly
BioBrick-A-Bot Model C is the prototype of an extensible Genomic Lab Liquid Handling System. We build it using Lego bricks, and it can be easily replicated by other iGEM teams and by researchers in Molecular Biology who cannot afford a typical, $10,000, commercial system. The design is modular plug-and-play, so that we can easily collaborate with future iGEM teams to modify or improve on its design and to add new functionalities.
BioBrick-A-Bot comprised of 2 LegoRoboBrick modules (ALPHA and PHI), mounted on a frame (BETA). Here’s what the acronyms means:
ALPHA – Automated Lego Pipette Head Assembly
PHI – Pneumatic Handling Interface
BETA – BioBrick Environment Testing Apparatus
This project needs great precision to position the pipette head accurately in 3-D space, and to transfer a few microliter of fluids. In order to achieve the much needed precision, we have replaced the Lego NXT firmware with RobotC firmware which provide floating point representations.  RobotC also gives us the flexibility to develop sophisticated C programs needed to drive this project. The computations to reverse-triangulate any point in 3-D space is also non-trivial. We use 3x3 rotational matrix to simplify our mathematical modeling .
Due to a hardware limitation of Lego Minsdstorm, each NXT brick can only be connected to a maximum of 3 motors. We need 6 motors for this project, and use 2 NXT bricks. We designed and implemented a Master Slave Synchronization System using blue-tooth wireless technology.  ALPHA is the master and when it is properly positioned at the right location, it will transmit wireless messages to PHI to request the type of pipette operations that it needs (either aspirate, dispense or clean).
We provide a proof of concept of this project by demonstrating the transfer of blue dyes, 4 at"

Original model
The original model of DNA recombination by integrase
At the beginning of our dry lab work, we use a simple model to describe the main process of the integrase recombination. (figure1.1)
Figure 1.1 | “PB” is the attP and attB sites of DNA, and “LR” is the recombination product, attL and attR sites, which are direction-changed, of the DNA. PBI is the complex of DNA and 4 integrase molecule. LRI1 and LRI2 are two kinds of complex which are conformationally distinct from PBI. The “single arrow” represents the reaction which can reach rapid equilibrium with the equilibrium constant over it. The “double arrow” represents the slow reaction with the reaction rate constant over and below it. “K(bI)” is the equilibrium constant. “k(+r), “k(-r)”, “k(+syn)”, “k(-syn)” is the reaction rate constant. The site direction change occur in the second reaction: “PBI” to “LRI(1)”.
Previous researches have shown that the combination and dissociation process between DNA and the integrase can be very fast. Therefore, we assume that rapid equilibrium can be reached in the first and forth step in our model. Both of the reaction share the same equilibrium constant, KbI. [1]
Thus, we are able to describe the whole process above with four equations.
The original model composed of all the functions above can perfectly predict the recombination reaction in vitro[1], where the concentration of integrase is considered to be constant, because the concentration of integrase required for efficient recombination is much higher than the one of the DNA substrate. The simulation results are shown here. (figure1.2)
Figure 1.2 | It separately describes how the proportion of substrate “PB” and product “LR” in total DNA varies within 10 hours. The red line represents the concentration proportion of the product, “LR”. More calculation details about this graph are attached to the back.
As the graph shows, the transformation rate can reach almost 80 percent in general.

3. Best Practice Requirement
In the USA, to obtain a patent, an inventor must reveal the best way to practice the invention in the patent application. They cannot keep an essential part secret. However, in Europe, no such requirement exists, inventors just have to provide one way to practice the invention, regardless of how sub-optimal it is.
4. Patent Publication
In both the USA and Europe, patents are published 18 months after they are filed, regardless of whether or not they are to be granted.
5. Rights Conferred and Opposition
Once a patent has been granted in the USA, it is a property right that prevents anyone from making, selling, or using the patented invention in the entire USA. A patented granted by the European Patent Office grants these same rights in the 27 countries signed up to the European Patent Convention. However, if a party wishes to get a patent annulled in those countries, they must approach each country individually to dispute the patent (after 9 months has passed after granting), whereas the USA has one office to handle disputes throughout the country. If a patent is challenged at the EPO within 9 months of granting, the patent holder and challenger present arguments to the EPO in writing and orally before a final decision is made. If a patent is challenged in the USA, a re-examination procedure is initiated at the patent office, where any parties (not just the challenger) can present evidence to dispute the patent. However, once this evidence has been gathered, only the patent holder discusses the validity of the patent with the patent office directly.
6. Inventive Step
The most important part of the patent application is the evidence of a novel inventive step. This holds for both the European patent system, and the USA. However, the European system is much stricter in its interpretation of a novel inventive step, in that to be inventive, it must solve a technical problem in a non-obvious way, i.e. no problem solved = no inventive step; not technical (e.g. economic) = no inventive step.

Background
Historical Background
For centuries, humans have fascinated over silk. The earliest known production of the material dates back to the Yangshao period as early as 3000 B.C. Over the years, the process of sericulture, the growth of silkworms to rear silk, has evolved time and time again.  Silk as a material was at its height during the famed Silk Road period, where the lucrative Chinese silk trade dominated much of transcontinental trade. Long after, however, the idea behind silk processing still remains the same: growing silkworms, from which silk is extracted, cleaned and further processed.   For our project, we intend to take this a few steps further: instead of growing silkworms in factories, we want bacteria to be our microbial factories, producing silk proteins as it would any other.
Biochemistry of Silk
The mechanical properties of spider silk are a result of its primary amino acid sequence. Although the   amino acid sequences for various types of spider silk are well documented, it is still relatively unknown   how these amino acids aggregate and contribute to the strength and stability of silk. Silk proteins are   composed of repeats of short amino acid sequences (approximately 33 amino acids). These repeats can   be referred to as monomers. Each monomer consists of a glycine rich stretch, followed by an alanine   rich stretch. It is hypothesized that these hydrophobic alanines form beta sheet crystals with other silk   proteins, and contribute to the strength of the silk fibers. The glycine stretches are thought to form   alpha helices and contribute to the flexibility of the protein. This monomer sequence is repeated many   times in one protein, and allow for strong interactions with other silk proteins. These simple motifs   repeated over and over are the key to the formation of one of the strongest materials known to man.
Applications
Silk is a naturally strong and flexible material, and so it is a unique fiber that can be used in applications that require the normally contradicting qualities of tremendous strength and low weight. It could be woven into thick cables for"

A OxyR-induced Promoter BBa_K1104201 (TrxC promoter)
A Transcription Factor Activated by Oxidative Stress BBa_K1104200 (OxyR) we apply a constitutive promoter to the OxyR coding sequence to overexpress the OxyR protein, which is expected to boost the sensitivity of our ROS-induced promotors.
An antimicrobial peptide BBa_K1104200 (Defensin1) the mechanism which insects use to protect against the invasion of microbes.
Data for Pre-Existing and Optimized Parts
AhpCp
We successfully improved the biobrick part: ahpC promoter ahpC (K362001) . Originally created by the KIT-Kyoto 2010 iGEM team by taking the upstream 1000bp of the AhpC gene, we improved the promoter by first mutating the PstI cutting site to make it conform to Assembly standard 10. We then designed specific primers to cut short the original sequence of AhpCp promoter to trim out unneeded sequences make it more efficient. More details about the design can be found on the Nosema Sensor page.
AhpCp1000 Part:BBa_K1104203
We succesfully mutated the Pst1 site (ctgcag->ctacag) of K362001.
The supplementary characterization and the application of AhpC promoter has been added to the experience page of BBa_K1104203 (AhpCp1000) .
The AhpCp1000 derived OxyR-induced promoters we created are as follows:

Teaching students about biological literacy, such as what things are, can help assist the students in possibly pursuing a career in their budding interest.
Dr. Christopher Szent-Gyorgyi does his work in the Molecular Biology and Imaging Center (MBIC) in Mellon Institute. The work that he’s done with Coelenterazine and his in-depth knowledge of it has made our project possible.
What is your background?
I left NIH as a yeast molecular biologist. I worked in a small company in Pittsburgh for 5 years. I was very interested in bioluminescence cloning for consumer products where we would create bioluminescence lights through a large and cheap scale. I then got hired for a larger company and helped devise a cheap synthesis of Coelenterazine. My work for Coelenterazine goes back 50 years but I worked for this company for around 3-4 years before we split up. I arrived at CMU when I wrote up a small business innovation research grant and they hired me after I left this small company.
What is your background with Coelenterazine?
Coelenterazine comes from Copepods, which is a very practical organism. We were able to isolate various luciferases and clone them into practical devices. For example, during World War II, the Japanese in the Pacific used luciferases from shrimp that would light up in caves which were dark. We also made squirt guns using luciferases where we were able to produce them for less than 10 cents per milligram. Lastly, I was able to use Acoran and clone it into a metastable complex. It physically complexed with luciferases that fired off in the presence of Calcium. Unfortunately due to some FDA regulations we were unable to fully quantify our success.
So there are some luciferases that excrete mucus, is there something in that mucus to allow the luciferase to grow?
There is no reason to assume mucus is causing it because mucus acts as a coherence cloud that acts as a decoy predator in order to maintain integrity of luciferase. In addition it is very difficult to maintain the composition of the mucus since it is excreted externally blending it into the environment. Despite Gaussia being tough, replicating the mucus cloud in some fashion is rather difficult due to the external secretion."

Results:
All of the cell types survived the transfection process –no significant death rate was noticed
In the HEK cells used as control indeed there was an expression of the GFP gene under the fluorescence microscope the expression wasn’t high
No GFP was detected in the microglia and astrocytes cells in both option of transfection
Figure 1 - Cells after transfection with calcium phosphate. On top cells underregular light and on the bottom the same picture under fluorescence light. From left to right: HEK, BV2, C8D30.
Discussion:
The purpose of the experiment was to introduce a fluorescent gene into microglia and astrocytes using the HEK cells as control. Because fluorescence illumination is obtained in the control cells, it is assumed that the transduction process worked properly, but the specific cells of the microglia and astrocytes do not respond well to the process in a manner similar to the control cells. It should be noted that the percentage of infection in the control cells was not particularly high, which may indicate a process that is not done optimally or on problems in concentrations of DNA.
Conclusion:
The process of transfusion using calcium chloride is simple and inexpensive, but does not allow high penetration rates in our target cells - astrocytes and microglia.
While there was fluorescence illumination in the control cells, it was lower than expected, which means that conditions may be improved to increase efficiency, and this may also could have effect on the target cells.
Since there are many materials that make up the buffer, it is possible that a change in quantity or lack of accurate preparation may affect the quality of the results.
It should be concluded that this method, especially in a short period of time that does not allow many adjustments and repetitions, is not suitable for the continuation of work in the project and has indeed been abandoned in favor of the use of ready-made reagents that showed higher efficiency in control cells and astrocytes and microglia.

Human Practices: Overview
Overview
This year, we tried to jump into as many chances as possible to learn more about role and value of synthetic biology and the future of this academic field. In this new information society, we can easily obtain knowledge on the Internet and many iGEMers may think the learning happens only in the labs or on the computers. That's sometimes true, but it's not always true that a bunch of information automatically comes to our pocket, which means we sometimes have to break free from the obsession with the project work.
We can proudly say our integrated human practices helped us make progress in our project design. By integrating our human practices with the results from our wet lab experiments and modeling, iGEM2017 Team TokyoTech have executed our project with improved design in accordance with comments from general public, and have strengthened the public engagement of a two-way dialogue between our team and the public through this summer.
Basic Human Practices
1) Organizing a symposium about synthetic biology for the public
On Oct 1st, we held an open symposium for middle school and high school students. We planned and managed the event and as guests, we invited three experts from microbiology (Prof. Oshima), synthetic biology (Prof. Kiga) and bioethics (Dr. Nudeshima).
2) Giving lectures about biosafety at local high schools
On September 2nd, we visited two high schools in Saitama Prefecture. We gave lectures and organized groupwork activities at both schools.
3) Attending Summer School (Theme: Social Epidemiology)
On September 9th and 10th, some team members attended 5th Summer School of Japan Society of Research and Information on Public and Co-operative Economy. (The venue was Ritsumeikan University in Kyoto.)

Stockholm,2017,Team:Stockholm#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," primer anneals to the gene following the attTn7 integration site (glmS), while the reverse primer binds to the transposition cassette. A formed product means that the two sites are present in the same template. Given that one of the primers anneals only to the genome, this must mean that the product from the colony PCR reaction comes from the chromosome, not a plasmid.
Successful integration was proven with transformed bacteria exhibiting red color, where RFP is found in genome integration plasmids only, because they have ampicillin resistance, while the pSB1C3 backbone is contains chloramphenicol resistance. The integration into the specific attTn7 site was also confirmed with colony PCR using primers covering the downstream glmS gene (genome site) and part of the Tn7R site (plasmid site).
Figure 12. Colony PCR genome integration. PCR performed with primers annealing to the genome (forward primer glmS gene) and to the Tn7R sequence in the transposition cassette (reverse primer Tn7 sequence). A formed product means that the insert has been successfully integrated into the genome. 1. Ladder M, 2-11. Colony PCR red colonies, ladder M.
Annotated region shows bands at approx. 200 bp, which represents amplification of a product where both primers anneal, indicating genome integration. Wells 4-9. contain DNA from colonies with successful integration.
Hypothesis 2: Genome integration of cumate regulatory system
Hypothesis 3: Genome integration of tryptophan regulatory system
After successful cloning of both systems and follow-up experiments, such as proliferation and dose-dependent protein expression tests, the next stage would be to integrate them into the bacterial chromosome. Due to time constraints this step was not performed.
Hypothesis 4: Removal of Gm antibiotic resistance from genome integration cassette in delivery plasmids from UPO-Sevilla 2011
The gentamicin cassette was removed from the iGEM HQ plasmids with the goal to limit the spreading of antibiotic resistance to the genome. The genes coding for the resistance are located inside the transposable cassette of the plasmids, meaning they get transferred along with the fragment of interest.
We have removed the 800 bp insert by digesting the plasmids with SphI, whose restriction sites flank both sides of the gentamicin cassette. The digestion was followed by religation and transformation. An informative digestion was performed, where a presence of two bands, one of which at ~800 bp would indicate an unsuccessful reaction"
