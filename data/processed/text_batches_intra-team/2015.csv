Team
Moyra Chikomo
I’m an Electronics and Communications Engineering student.
I chose to be a part of the Kent iGEM team this year as I wanted to be a part of a research team that was a little out of my field of study. I felt this would be a great chance to use my biology background from school and see if I could integrate that with my passion for engineering.
After I have graduated I am looking into doing further research and work towards a PhD. In the little “free” time I have I enjoy channeling my creative side, this involves general arts and crafts as well as writing short stories (for my eyes only for now ☺☺). I would say watching back to back series takes up a lot of my time and keeps me sane.
Raneem Jaghoub
I am an Electronics and Communications Engineering student at The University of Kent. I chose to do iGEM for the experience and to help me decide whether I would like to continue to do a Masters degree in Genetic Engineering. In my free time I enjoy reading, painting and travelling.
Jonathan Pope
I am a Biology student at The University of Kent. I chose to do iGem because it gives students experience in working in teams with synthetic biology outside of the usual confinements of a syllabus.
In the future i plan to further my study and complete a PhD and gain more experience in the field of Biology. I play for a local mens football team and listen to hours of music in my free time as well as being an avid Arsenal fan.
Rob Middlewick
I am a Biology student at The University of Kent. I chose to join the iGEM team due to my fascination with synthetic biology and because I believe that it is an emerging market. It has provided me with valuable experience working in a research environment that will prepare me to undertake a PhD after I’ve completed my degree. In my spare time I enjoy listening to music, reading, and cooking.
Richard Crane (aka Dave)
I am a Biomedical Sciences student from Ipswich, England studying at The University of Kent. I followed the progress of the 2014 Kent iGEM team and after seeing synthetic biology become more prevalent in the news, I was inspired to join this year.
After I graduate, I would like to pursue a PhD and stay in academia. They say about me: ""Richard  likes to hurt peoples feelings and doesn't care about the wiki"".
James Aston
I am the team's physicist, I spent my time at iGEM working on the modeling and the wiki. I joined the iGEM team because I wanted to be a part of a multidisciplinary team. In my spare time I like to play guitar and watch Always Sunny reruns.

Project design
Our entire team together with the instructors and advisors decided on the project that we are carrying out at the beginning of the summer. The team met up once every week to share project ideas and discuss the direction of the project during the summer. The project that we have designed is to create nanowire from amyloid produced by E.coli creating a more biocompatible and cheaper alternative to current materials used as nanowire. We were inspired by the pioneering work carried out by Ann Hochschild and Viknesh Sivanathan [1] which provided us with information on how to utilise the curli export system of E.coli strain VS45 to form our nanowires. Also the work of Frederick et al. 2014 [2] and Glover et al. 1997 [3] which helped us understand the formation of amyloid and the self-assembling ability of Sup35-NM. The amyloid fusion protein that we have produced has been made using Sup35-NM fused to a cytochrome. More on the description of our project can be found here .
Modelling and software
We wanted to develop tools to predict the growth and production of amyloid nanowires, and to find a way to visually represent the amyloid production of the E.coli bacteria in 3D. This was accomplished by the modeling team consisting of James, Moyra and Raneem. The team developed a new software implementing Brownian dynamics [4] and the Monte Carlo method [5] written in Matlab. Our model and software is available to view here .
Policy and Practice
The main Policy and Practice issues identified by the team is centered on policy and public opinion on the use of bio-nano material. Finding out what the general public and members of parliament thought of our idea was therefore carried out in order to develop a wider understanding of how our product would be received in the real world. A Policy and Practice team consisting of Moyra, Raneem, Alice and Anna was formed to allow us to communicate with other iGEM teams as well as the general public and political figures to gather their opinions and tell them more about our project. More information on our Policy and Practice can be found here .
Wet lab
The wet lab work was naturally given to the bioscientists within the team, including Katarina, Richard, Alice, Natalie, Suparna, Jonathan, Anna and Rob who have carried out a vast range of experiments including but not exclusively AFM (Atomic Force Microscopy) imaging, Gibson Assembly, Ligation and PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction). This was vital to the success of our project and was our main focus throughout the competition. More of our protocols, experiments and results can be found here .
Writing
Throughout the course of iGEM the whole team have been carrying out research and reading papers related to our project to allow us all to contribute to writing up our final project. We have weekly meetings where we talk to one another about what has been done during the week which we record in our notebook which you can find here . We have designed and written posters, presentations and in depth explanations into our project that the whole team have helped produce. The wiki was organised and coded by our wiki team consisting of James, Natalie and Raneem.

Attributions
Each team must clearly attribute work done by the student team members on this page. The team must distinguish work done by the students from work done by others, including the host labs, advisors, instructors, and individuals not on the team roster.
Can we base our project on a previous one?
Yes! You can have a project based on a previous team, or based on someone else's idea, as long as you state this fact very clearly and give credit for the original project.
Why is this page needed?
The Attribution requirement helps the judges know what you did yourselves and what you had help with. We don't mind if you get help with difficult or complex techniques, but you must report what work your team did and what work was done by others.
For example, you might choose to work with an animal model during your project. Working with animals requires getting a license and applying far in advance to conduct certain experiments in many countries. This is difficult to achieve during the course of a summer, but much easier if you can work with a postdoc or PI who has the right licenses.

Liu Runze, is a junior in Physics, USTC. He has a lot of interests like reading, listening music and watching movies as well. Besides, he has a great interest in computer programming and team management. In USTC-Software team, he is the vice  captain and he is responsible for  Human Practice and Collaboration with USTC team. He is an out-goning guy and he's willing to make friends with others.
Steven is from Nanjing and his major is physics.He has great desire to explore a new field and iGEM enables him to meet different people. He likes playing handball and table tennis. With strong desire to do interdisciplinary study, he is willing to discuss with every iGEMer!
Zhi Li, or Nate, is currently a junior student from School for the Gifted Young (SCGY), USTC.  He has many hobbies，especially music and reading, and sports like soccer as well. In this summer,  he spent a lot time playing chess with others in the intervals of iGEM project. Besides, he is open-minded,  helpful and considered to be interesting when the team members work together. The persistence and optimism  are quite the shining points on him.
CHEN XINAN, or Nancy Chan, is manager of our team as well as a junior majoring Mathematics. She loves Sciences but unfortunately understanding them has always been a tough problem for her. She can undoubtedly be described as an interesting and humorous girl. You just never get bored with her around. Anyone can tell that she ‘hates’ our captain because, as she said, they are not in the same dimensionality. LOL! Nancy develops a lot of hobbies such as swimming, badminton, travelling, skiing, photographing, etc. But not table tennis! You will regret playing with her.
Hi! My name is Lingyuan Ji. I major in Theoretical Physics in USTC. My main contribution to the team is the molecule dynamics algorithm in BioBLESS. I always like to ask why to interesting things and try my best to figure them out. Hey, what's up there? Let's find out why XD.

Zhu Yilin, or George, a sophomore who majors in physics, takes a great interest in programming. Well, maybe neither physics nor programming does he really well in, but still passion remains in his life for getting to know about technological stuffs. Of course, there are many things that are his enjoyments, such as travelling, reading books, and writing essays to express his love to his life occasionally. In this year’s competition, his work is coding team’s wiki along with his teammates, and he is having a lot of fun in finding the beauty of programming!
Wulonghao, and you can call him Bill. This guy is a young geek OTAKU who is deeply in love with ACG and science. Maybe sounds awesome, but that is really creepy actually. When not knowing how to write the code, he will go around the room or the building even the whole house. And all what he has done or what he is dong have nothing to do with his major, Physics.
Zongxin Yang, often called St. Yang, who comes from School of Information Science and Technology, USTC, has just entered sophomore year in this semester. His frankness and easy-going make him quite welcome in our team. Also, he is a crazy fan of football and chess. It is worth mentioning that he is one of the members of school football team. His hometown lies in the north of Guilin, which is famous as one of China's most picturesque cities. In our project, he has undertaken mainly the front-end code, and proves to be hard-working.
Liu Miaofeng, is a sophomore student from USTC. He helps the team for the editor of wiki. He is interested in programming and DIY something useful, for example, he participated the robot competition. Besides, he is friendly to others, but he may be a little shy. So you could try to communicate with him and enjoy the conversation.
LI Zitian, is a junior in Physics and Computer Science and Technology.He has a great interest in computer programming. For example, he is skilled in C, C++, Java, Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript and so on. He has wrote several websites because of the interests during the school life, so he is experienced in Front-end web develop. What's more, he is also interested in biology. For the reasons given above, he wants to join the team USTC-Software.
Henry, or Li Hanwen, was a freshman in electrical engineering. He works in front-end group and makes the wiki. He is so zhuangbility that he knows a lot about computer technology cursorily but not profoundly. He loves table tennis and singing. He has an ambition to be a bass and have a low-frequency voice.

Zhang Hao, or Trumpet, is a sophomore in Physics. YES, his English name is Trumpet, because his Chinese name has the similar sound with the trumpet.he loves cats, and he is simply the most artless person in the whole team. Sometimes, He even labels himself as a 'cat'.
Si-Yuan Zhuang, majoring in Computer Science, having mastery of programming and bug-fixing,   contributes a lot to improving the quality of the code and designing the cache system. He often  has fun with others (e.g. hacking Zhang Hao's server). Though once a platform developed by him  for our software was deprecated, he did not feel depressed.
Tianyi Cui, known as little Cui, is the leader of the backend of our project. He has a bad eyesight but he seldom take his glasses. He is an outcome boy in the team, always filling with novel ideas in his mind. He could play a little ping-pong ball but he never wins Zhi Li.
Cui Yanxuan, or E-Neo (His screen name) is a jonior majoring in Geophysics (seems nothing to do with biology?). He is interested in computer and crazy about opensource software. He is a memeber of the backend group. After join the team, he spent a lot of time to learn about sythetic biology. Besides, he loves playing games with other teamates.

Attributions
Each team must clearly attribute work done by the student team members on this page. The team must distinguish work done by the students from work done by others, including the host labs, advisors, instructors, and individuals not on the team roster.
Can we base our project on a previous one?
Yes! You can have a project based on a previous team, or based on someone else's idea, as long as you state this fact very clearly and give credit for the original project.
Why is this page needed?
The Attribution requirement helps the judges know what you did yourselves and what you had help with. We don't mind if you get help with difficult or complex techniques, but you must report what work your team did and what work was done by others.
For example, you might choose to work with an animal model during your project. Working with animals requires getting a license and applying far in advance to conduct certain experiments in many countries. This is difficult to achieve during the course of a summer, but much easier if you can work with a postdoc or PI who has the right licenses.

TEAM
Michigan Biological Software Team
""The greatest team the University of Michigan has produced since the Fab Five""
I'm Josh Abramson, one of the team's co-founders and the current president. Hailing from West Bloomfield, I've made a living studying Biology, Mathematics, and Chemical Physics at the University of Michigan.   Before leading the software team, I was on the Michigan lab team for 4 years as a member and 1 year as an advisor.  Outside of iGEM, I enjoy tree climbing, playing pranks on my professors, and computer games.
Hi, my name is Hy Doan and I am from Grand Rapids, Michigan. I am junior studying Computer Science. In my free time, I enjoy playing/listening to jazz, exercising, and destroying friendships while playing Settlers of Catan (or any other board game). Along with school, I am in Groove Performance Group, an awesome percussion group, and I volunteer with Ready Set Start, teaching music workshops.
I am Graham, a senior at U of M, studying Molecular Biology and Computer Science. I enjoy fishing, hiking, and playing settlers of Catan. I wanted ProtoCat to be called ProtoDog but that wouldn't make any sense.
Hi, my name is Max Gittelman. I am a Junior studying Computer Science at U of M. I enjoy eating pizza at team meetings and allowing my younger twin brother to copy whatever I do. I fortunately am a dog person and highly recommended the name “Protodog” but the name was quickly struck down due to its non puniness. Also Graham steals jokes.
Hi, my name is Zachary Gittelman and I am a Junior studying Computer Science Engineering. I am from Miami, Florida and my interest in biotech has lead me to join the BioSoft team. Additionally, I am on the Michigan Autonomous Aerial Vehicles team and I enjoy learning about AI, running, skiing, and mimicking my twin Max. And remember, if you’re not the first cat, you’re the last cat.
Hi, I'm Ali Hammoud. I'm a junior at the University of Michigan majoring in biochemistry and computer science. I spend a lot of my time studying for classes and working in a clinical research lab, but in my spare time I enjoy cooking and spending time with friends.
Hello, I’m Ali Turfah. I am a sophomore and I plan to major in a form of Engineering. In my spare time, I enjoy designing as well as building costumes, playing video games, and studying languages, both spoken and computer. I have two cats, so I’m really excited about the ProtoCat designs.
I am Mary Weber, a junior from East Lansing, Michigan majoring in Informatics, with a concentration in life-science. I am interested in data analysis, particularly in regards to its role in improving the efficiency and accuracy of health systems. Outside of school, I love spending time outdoors and am a frequent visitor to the Arboretum and the Kerrytown Farmer’s Market.
Hi, I'm Katherine Williams. I am a sophomore in computer science from Hudsonville, MI. Besides the iGEM team, I am in a game development club called WolverineSoft and the Harry Potter Alliance at the University of Michigan. I enjoy playing piano and reading in my free time.
I am Campbell Yore, a patent agent registered with the United States Patent and Trademark Office and a third year law student at Santa Clara University School of Law. My technical background is in organic chemistry and bioelectronic materials. Biology is Technology, a book by Robert Karelson, introduced me to iGEM and the possibilities of synthetic biology and I've been hooked ever since. Collaborating with other groups, learning about biological circuit design, and advocating for student entrepreneurs are my favorite parts of participating in iGEM.

The second person in history to reach the North Pole. He’s also rumored to have defeated Napoleon in single combat. Rajiv studies Engineering, and cultivates his mushroom garden in his spare time. It is rumoured that he is the true identity of Batman, although this has not been proven.
Simon
Enjoys a Fosters with the boys, dingo hunting and the occasional wombat stew. Do ask him to show you the scar where a bull shark tried to eat his foot. When he’s not surfing on Bondi beach and being featured on the latest cover of Men’s Health magazine, Simon studies Natural Sciences. He is interested in Biochemistry, Physics and Computer Science.  Loves 3D printing (in massive amounts).
Souradip
Inventor of the wheel, the telephone and also the internet, Souradip is a true alchemist at heart. He was once described as a “top bloke” by his contemporary Aristotle ca. 200 BC. Pursued by Interpol for hacking into MakeSpace, his current disguise is as a Medic. Unbeknownst to him, he drops this guise when given some electronics to program.
Will
Simon’s mysterious doppelganger. Shares very similar research interests with Simon and is never seen in the same room with him, leading some to believe that they are actually the same person. Will studies Natural Sciences, with specific interest in Biochemistry and Mathematics. He intends to create the biologically inspired version of Skynet when he does his PhD.
Tobey
Maverick physicist. Very little is know about Tobey's past, save that his birth coincided with the fall of the Roman Empire in 476 C.E. Speculation has lead some to conclude that he is in fact the reincarnation of the Egyptian pharaoh Akhenaten.
Kate
Kate, along with Watson and Crick, was one of the lead discoverers of the deep fried Mars bar. It was this discovery that led her to Glasgow, the spiritual home of deep fried chocolates. She has since shifted her interests to Cancer Research, and is currently carrying out her PhD at the University of Glasgow into the relationship between Epstein Barr virus and cancer.
Jim
On the seventh day, Jim created Marchantia as a model organism. From here sprung the entire field of synthetic biology and the religion Scientology. Jim has studied more ‘ologies’ than you’ve had hot dinners, and is rumoured to have read every journal article ever written. In his down time, Jim likes to listen to The Ride of the Valkyries on repeat while repotting his liverworts.

Thomas Bridge – project leader
BSc Biotechnology with foundation
One of the reasons I joined the iGEM team was to get more experience in the lab and get better at presenting in competitions. I also thought it would be a good opportunity to meet students with the same interests as me, whether they are from my university in different years or studying somewhere completely different.
Zeljka Kalinic – project leader
I am studying BSc Biotechnology, and have completed my second year of study. I took on this project to improve my laboratory and project management skills. The opportunity to work on a student led independent project is invaluable experince for any undergraduate student looking to undertake a career in synthetic biology. I look forward to the competition for the simple reason of meeting other like minded young scientist.
Amy Maclatchy – project leader
Hi. I’m the oldest member of our team. They say with age comes wisdom, not that this team needs it as they are all wise in their own ways. I recently graduated with a BSc Honours in Biochemistry.
iGEM has given me the opportunity to continue my learning and development of synthetic biology. Although it was not my pathway during my studies, it was a subject very briefly touched upon. It is hugely interesting and such a booming area of science, that it is very exciting to be riding that wave into the future. As this is my final opportunity to take part in such a competition, before embarking upon a new career, I felt this was a perfect time to hone in on my lab, as well as, research and presentation skills.
Ishwak Ahmed
I studied BSc Biological Sciences specialising in Forensic Biology. I was told about iGEM last year by a member and thought it was a great opportunity to meet new people from different backgrounds of science. Also it would be interesting to see what everyone could contribute to iGEM seeing as most of us have studied or are currently studying different degrees. I joined iGEM for the sole purpose of gaining more laboratory experience and also found Synthetic Biology fascinating.
Paulina Brajer
Hi, This is my first time on the iGEM team. Currently I am going into my third year at Westminster studying molecular biology and genetics.
IGEM has allowed me to develop my confidence from lab work to taking part in outreach projects. It has given me the opportunity to improve and expand on my laboratory skills and communication skills.  Throughout this process my knowledge has developed greatly especially in the area of synthetic biology and how many possibilities are out there.
Poppy Brown
Hi! I have just recently graduated in BSc in Biochemistry and I am very excited to be part of the iGEM competition. I thoroughly enjoyed my course and so I was happy to join the team and carry on learning about such interesting new things. I also really love meeting new people and working in the lab so this just seemed ideal.
Alina Chrzastek
Hi everybody, this is my first time on iGEM Team. I am studying microbiology and I just finished my second year.
Being part of the iGEM team gave me opportunity to not only improve my lab skills but also team work and public speaking through various tasks within the whole project. The iGEM meetings began in January and since that my knowledge about synthetic biology grew, I can now easily see connection between my microbiology interests and synthetic biology which both are equally fascinating.

Hira Khan
After participating in iGEM two years ago and thoroughly enjoying it, I knew if the opportunity arised again I would definitely join! I graduated from Biological Sciences and my final year project was heavily based on this year iGEM project. Therefore I believe I had a lot to offer in terms of background knowledge as well as what is required to make this competition a success! What I gain the most from this international competition are the incredible people I meet in this journey and being able to make a difference in the world.
Hibaq Obsiye
Bsc Biological Sciences Honours
After I was first told about the details of iGEM by a former member, last year, I could not wait to gain a hands on experience in this world of programmable biology. Despite the amazing lab experience, iGEM proves to be much much more, allowing me to connect with like-minded students across the globe. It also gives me the opportunity to sharpen vital social skills required for a future career in science.
Nura Sharif
I just graduated from BSc Molecular Biology & Genetics. I joined iGEM knowing that it will be an exciting project to be part of, and a chance to gain additional laboratory skills and improve my teamwork skills. Also, having no background knowledge about synthetic biology previously I believe my understanding on that area has grown.
Shuhanaz Shuma
I graduated from BSc Biological science (Molecular Biology and Genetics). I knew about iGEM 2013 but was unable to take part. This year, I thought it would be an interesting experience and exciting opportunity to gain extra skills in the laboratory and improve existing ones. I wanted to put the content learnt from modules, i.e. synthetic biology from Biochemical Evolution and Molecular Engineering modules into real life practice. I also wanted to take part in this international competition to interact with other students and engage with the public.
Amritpal Singh
Hey guys! This is also my first iGEM experience. I am studying BSc biochemistry and have recently just finished my second year. The iGEM experience has really helped me understand that Lab work isn't as easy as it seems. Nonetheless it is the best experience I have had in my area to date. Studying about synthetic biology I have seen that all the theory learned in lectures can be applied and the ability to engineer bacteria through the manipulation of DNA is most fascinating. I cannot wait to increase my knowledge through this experience and apply it to my undergraduate course."

TEAM MEMBERS
A team would be nothing without it's members. As such, we would like to introduce ourselves and our mentors!
Undergraduate Team Members
Jacky Cheung
Named after Hong Kong pop sensation Jacky Cheung, Jacky is currently a sophomore at Columbia College studying computer science with his mind set on going into medicine. However, Jacky's web design skills are rather lackluster. Nonetheless, he makes a fantastic last-minute logo designer in his humble opinion and did his best to organize and take care of soft-, dry-, and wet- lab responsibilties. Outside of iGEM, Jacky enjoys playing handball, table tennis, and basketball if he's not buried under a pile of work that has to be done or sleeping.
Samuel (Sam) Magaziner
Descended from the noble Magaziner clan of Humenne, Hungary (then the Austro-Hungarian Empire), makers and managers of an exploding powder magazine factory, Sam has turned his interests to more peaceful and less explosive pursuits.  A 4th year undergraduate Biochemistry major, Sam enjoys microbiomes, gut peptides, and long walks on the beach.  Some say his beard whispers secrets of arcane and scientific portents whilst he transforms cells.  Others say it makes him look Amish.  Regardless, Sam played a major role in construct and experimental design.
Hudson Lee
Surprisingly not named after the Hudson River, much to the disbelief of his other New York City natives, Hudson is currently a 2nd year undergraduate Biology major.  Outside of the classroom, his interests include gymnastics, Korean Barbecue, breakdancing, and long walks on the beach.  Apart from iGEM, he splits his time among Ballroom, Hip-Hop, and Capoeira dance teams.  Even with these other commitments, Hudson headed up logo and banner designs as well as wetwork.
Suppawat (Kong) Kongthong
Kong hails from Bangkok, Thailand and is a sophomore studying Biology. When not pipetting, he’s usually cooking, learning Spanish from Kenya, who he is in turn teaching Thai, and watching Netflix (mainly Gossip Girl). Though he has never been to the beach, he enjoys long walks on the beach.
Kenya Velez
Kenya is currently a junior at Pace University majoring in biochemistry. The opportunity to be a part of the SPURS program, a biomedical research internship, has given me the opportunity to do research on the iGEM team. Currently my lab works consist in Columbia’s labs doing synthetic biology research and anti-microbial properties lab work at Pace University.
Junior Mentors
Sway Chen
Sway Chen is an MD/PhD student in Harris Wang’s lab at Columbia University. Her research focuses on developing novel methods for genetically engineering communities of microbes, particularly bacteria of the gut microbiome. Through this work, she hopes to better understand the role of human microbiomes in health and disease and to enable development of targeted therapeutic probiotics. Before coming to Columbia, Sway earned her AB in Chemistry and Physics from Harvard University and conducted research on motor circuits in the developing C. elegans nematode worm in Aravi Samuel’s lab.
Nathan Johns
Nathan is a PhD student in Harris Wang's Lab working on developing technologies for engineering diverse species and communities of microorganisms in order to study their evolution and to endow them with new capabilities. He is particularly interested in trying to engineer the many species of bacteria that make up the human microbiome with the goal of using them as novel therapeutics.
Sonja Billerbeck
Sonja is a postdoctoral fellow in the Cornish Laboratory. She received her PhD in 2013 at the Swiss Institute of Technology (ETH Zürich) in the interdisciplinary Department for Biosystems Science and Engineering (D-BSSE). During her doctoral studies, Dr. Billerbeck developed a novel strategy for the rational design of switchable proteins for application in cell-free biotechnology. Her current research interest revolves around the field of synthetic biology, with special emphasis on protein engineering strategies applied to understand and functionalize bacterial microcompartments.
Senior Mentors / Principal Investigators
Harris Wang
Harris Wang has joined Columbia University Medical Center as an Assistant Professor in the Columbia Initiative in Systems Biology and the Department of Pathology and Cell Biology. His research focuses on understanding the evolution of the ecosystems that develop within heterogeneous microbial communities. Using approaches from genome engineering, DNA synthesis, and next-generation sequencing, he studies how genomes in microbial populations form, maintain themselves, and change over time, both within and across microbial communities. His goal is to use synthetic biology approaches to engineer ecologies of microbial populations, such as those found in the gut and elsewhere in the human body, in ways that could improve human health.
Virginia Cornish
Virginia joined the faculty of the Chemistry Department at Columbia in 1999, where she carries out research at the interface of chemistry and biology, and was promoted to Associate Professor with tenure in 2004 and then Professor in 2007. Her laboratory brings together modern methods in synthetic chemistry and DNA technology to expand the synthetic capabilities of living cells.
Ken Shepard
Ken joined Columbia University in 1997, where he is now Professor of Electrical Engineering. At the same time, he co-founded CadMOS Design Technology, an EDA start-up which pioneered PacifIC and CeltIC, the first tools for large-scale signal integrity analysis of digital integrated circuits. The success of these tools led Cadence to acquire CadMOS in 2001.Current research interests interests focus on circuits for VLSI integrated circuits in deeply-scaled CMOS technologies, new technologies for electronics applications, and the application of integrated circuits for biology-related applications.
Dana Pe'er
Dana Pe'er is an Associate Professor in the Department of Biological Sciences at Columbia University and regarded as one of the leading researchers in computational systems biology. Her lab endeavors to understand the organization, function and evolution of molecular networks."

We would like to thank everyone who have helped us this summer. We have Professor Robert                     Forchheimer,                     who started the iGEM team here at Linköping University back in 2013, whitout whom LiU iGEM wouldn’t                     excist. He has helped us with his knowledge and support, as well as kindly opened his doors to his                     home for us to have a kick-off. We also would like to thank Lars-Göran Mårtenssen, who has                     helped us get                     through some rough part with his knowlegde and invaluable advices. He has also helped us with                     handeling                     of sending samples for sequencing, for which we are very grateful. Professor Per Hammarström has                     also                     helped us a lot and we really want to thank you for all support! We would also like to thank Anna                     Borg,                     whom we could call when we felt lost or needed help with something, thank you for your for all your                     help! Cecilia Andrésen has also helped us, we are                     forever thankful to her wisdom. We have also received very valuable support and equipment for the                     detector                     construction from David Beuger at Rapid Prototyping here at Linköping University, whom we                     would like to give a big                     thank to. In the modeling department we would like to thank Mikael Forsgren at MathCore for                     helping us out and providing licenses for their SystemModeler software which has come to great use                     for our team.
We would also like to give a huge thank you to Linköping University and IFM, both for                     sponsoring us                     monetary and for letting us use one of the laboraories to work in during this summer.
Of course we would like to thank all our sponsors, whether they helped us monetary or with                     laboratory equipments and kits, we are equally grateful.
Thank you all for your support,
this project would                 not have been possible without each and every one of you!

Lisa Bransell
I am a medical biology student, currently in my final year. Originally, I am from                                 a town called Uppsala, which is located 1 hour north of our capital city Stockholm.                                 Besides                                 my                                 passion for science, I have a great passion for food! I am constantly hungry and I'm                                 always                                 eating!
Favorite protein Vanilla Whey
10 years from now I am eating food! Not in the lab though, safety first! ;)
Marielle Danelljan
I have always been eager to understand and learn more about the surrounding world, to me                                 curiosity is vital quality. I find chemistry absolutely fascinating and therefore it                                 came                                 naturally to study engineering in chemical biology.
Favorite protein Rubisco
10 years from now I would like to find myself in a place where I can constantly learn new things                                 and develop as a person. Although, if this perfect image would somehow never be                                 fulfilled                                 you will find me at my parents basement, long lost with my lvl 140 mage in World of                                 Warcraft.
Agnes Ekberger
I have lived both in the countryside and in the ciity. I've always been interested in                                 the                                 field                                 of biology, and now I'm studying for my bachelor degree in biology. I'm still figuring                                 out                                 what                                 field of biology I want to pursue, but it will probably be genetics. In my freetime I                                 like                                 to be                                 out and about and walk around outside, preferably with a camera in my hands. I'm also                                 very                                 social and likes to hang out with friends and family. I also love my cats very much, my                                 sweet                                 company at home!
Favorite protein Hemoglobin, because it's a really cool protein that you can learn alot about and the                                 oxygen                                 transportation is pretty good for survival. ;)
10 years from now I have become a master in the genetic field of biology, and I have succeeded to                                 genetically                                 manipulate the best LiU iGEM team ever. Or I have a cool job at a lab somewhere, that                                 would                                 be                                 okay too.

This is us :) we are high school students who participate in the future scientists and inventors program at the Technion institute, Israel
Hey, my name is Chen Mechel, I’m 17 years old. I’m the head of the project and a part of the modeling team. This project is an incredible opportunity for me to experience in the fascinating field of synthetic biology. Furthermore it gives me the opportunity to take part of an international competition. My favorite quotation: ""Life is 10 percent what you make it, and 90 percent how you take it."" Irving Berlin
Hey, i’m Tomer, I’m 17 and the head of the modeling team, I enjoy working with my friends on our project and learning new stuff in many fields through it.
My favorite scientist is albert einstein (who else?) and i really hope that someday I will make a change which is even 0.1% of what he did. Apart from that I like hiking, reading and listening to music (favorite band- Pink Floyd) and rather be a giant rodent then a tiny elephant because if people are afraid of small rodents, then a giant one will be invincible…
Hey, my name is Naseeb Saida, I am 17 years old , I am  the head of the cloning team of our project. I enjoy working in the lab and using advanced technology.  I don’t like to design primers with computer programs. I look forward to see the other teams' project and to learn more things from smart students in the competition. I am happy to work on this project because I am learning new things in each day and I think that working with team is the best way to improve my knowledge. I am working with amazing students, and I am interested in taking part of an intentional competition.
Hello, my name is Matar Rosen, I’m 17 years old. In our project I’m mostly responsible for the wiki. The thing I enjoy most in our project is learning new stuff from my peers and our instructors. I look forward to meeting new interesting people in the jamboree.
Quote i find intriguing : “If you don’t have a plan, you become part of somebody else’s plan.” ― Terence McKenna
I would rather read minds then be invisible because I’m really curious to know how other people’s mind work.
Hi, my name is Loai Absawy, I’m 18 years old. In our project I worked on the cloning and also worked on designing the presentation and poster. I like working in the lab with my team it makes me feel like a real scientist. iGEM is a very unique experience way beyond any other experience I had.
I hate writing paragraphs especially ones that aren’t about science. I like machine engineering and inventing, computers, and robotics. My idols are Leonardo da Vince and Nikola Tesla because both are inventors that invented machines way ahead of their time and researched nature trying to satisfy their curiosity. I am looking forward to the jamboree and seeing what other teams worked on.
Hey, I’m Fady Baderand I’m 17 year old ,I’m part of the cloning team in our project, I definitely enjoy our work in lab, it's fun and interesting in the same time. I have learned many new things in this project,  and I'm looking forward to learn more. I'm also excited to meet interesting people in this competition with the same interests, and I hope our team returns home with a smile on its face from the wonderful experience and results :).
Hi, I’m Vered Levi, I’m 17 years old. I am a part of the modeling team, and I also helped Matar a little with the Wiki.
My favorite quote is: “A quote does not have to be intelligent, but when it is restated as a quote - it looks intelligent” (Vered Levi).
I would rather be with someone I don’t like on a deserted island, because than I wouldn’t feel guilty for eating him when we ran out of food. I wish all teams good luck, &#9786 especially us;
Hi, my name is Joseph Mouallem, I'm 18 years old. In our project I worked on the cloning and also helped Loai a little bit in designing the presentation and poster. I enjoy working in the lab, it makes me feel like a real scientist, specially when we think about the whole project all the way from the beginning. Despite of all the things that I enjoyed doing in the project there still some things that I didn't like during our work In the lab, these things can be summarized with two basic items, the first is waiting long time between one experiment and the one after, the second is having unwanted results after a very hard work. I look forward in the competition to meet the other teams and their interesting projects, in addition, I'm so curious to learn from their discoveries through their project. I'm sure that all of us will enjoy the IGEM conference in Boston and I wish everybody good luck, especially us.
Hey, my name is Ido and I’m 18 years old. I’m a member of the modeling team. I was responsible for making our mathematical model, together with the other modeling team members. I also developed our search engine “iGem Explorer” together with Itay, Tomer and Chen. In the “iGem Explorer” subproject I was responsible of doing the UI of the search engine. I love learning and doing math, and I also love to program. I had the amazing opportunity to combine both of these loves in our project. I’m so grateful that I was able to participate in this project, because I learned a LOT about modeling and software development and because I also  learned about working together with other people on the same mission.
Hey there! I’m Itay and I’m from Israel. I’m 17 years old. I’m doing all kinds of things for the team but especially modelling and programming. My scientific idol is Richard Feynman. This competition exposed me to many fields that I’ve never had the chance to encounter before, especially to synthetic biology. A quote I like: “The two most important days in your life are the day you are born and the day you find out why” –Mark Twain
we also had Moran Shapira, Sigal Kroitoro, Iftach Vicrobizki and May Merav.
Our advisors
Without them our project wouldn't have been possible
Hey, my name is Beate and I am a PhD student in the lab of Roee Amit and the supervisor of the first iGEM high school team of the Technion. Coming originally from Germany, I received my training for an MSc equivalent diploma in Biotechnology, Biochemistry and Genetics at both the Albert-Ludwigs-University of Freiburg (Germany) and University of Almería (Spain). During my participation as a student of the Freiburg iGEM team in 2010 and supervisor of the Freiburg team 2013, I gained insight into the fascinating world of Synthetic Biology and I am happy to help and advice the students of this team with my experience in iGEM and Syn Bio.
I’m Alexey Tomsov, I'm 25 year old, born in Minsk, Belarus and raised in a small Israeli Town. Just finished my BSc. in Biotechnology and Food Engineering, with the intention to open my own startup in the future. I love to laugh, listen to great music and have fun with my friends. I worked as a professional video editor in my past, I love working and managing creative projects
I'm Liron Abrahami, I’m 26 year old, starting my fourth and last year in my Bachelor’s studies in Biotechnology and Food Engineering I love art as well as science so I hope that in the future I will be able to combine both"

Hello dear synthetic biology fans! We are METU iGEM Team members. Now you can learn more about us and our specialities. Our team consists of various people from the field of BioScience. We have spent lots of time to get prepared well! (Exactly 7/24) Everyone in this team has done all the duties and we had a very successful team work. Lastly, we are very proud to be a part of this Group & Project.
TEAM MEMBERS
İlkem Kumru
Hello dear iGEMers, it's Ilkem Kumru here, a senior student in Biology Department of Middle East Technical University. This is my third year in iGEM. I am the team leader of this year's team. I take part in WetLab, P&P, Modeling, wiki designing and everything else. I always wanted to be even a small piece of biological sciences from my childhood. I am extremely happy to take place in METU iGEM Team, where everyone works with enthusiasm and excitement to discover new frontiers. A biology laboratory where we work iGEM is the place where I can live and work till death , and it is also the only place where I feel as immortal as my love of science.
Dorukcan Özköse
Hello all H.s.sapiens. My name is Dorukcan Özköse and I'm a junior student in Molecular Biology and Genetics Department at METU. This is my second year in iGEM, hence I'm so excited and curious about all synthetic biology subjects and our project. I love swimming, sightseeing and doing science about genetics. Good luck to all teams that are in iGEM 2015 contest.
Uğurcan Sakızlı
Hello people! =^o t o^=  I’m Uğurcan SAKIZLI and they call me “ghu” which is my nickname on the internet. I am just graduated from Biology Department of METU and I was –fortunately- dragged into the iGEM team by İlkem again and again. So, this is my third iGEM experience. I still believe what I learn here will become useful in my future education and life. I like working in the wetlab but I’m mainly participating in the modeling team. Yarışmacı arkadaşlara başarılar diliyorum.
Melda Ercan
Hi! I'm Melda Ercan. I'm a third grade student from biology department. This year is my first year with METU_Turkey Team. Despite being new member in the team, I've already felt that iGEM is like a playground where  you can use their toys with your own creativity. I am mainly involved in the wetlab part of our team and also take a role in human practice part. I believe that this experience will make a great contribution to not only my knowledge but also my decision about the studying area of biology which I would like to be in.
Sinem Usluer
Hello I am Sinem Usluer. I’m third year student department of Molecular Biology and  Genetics at METU. This is my first year at iGEM. I hope that I will learn lots of things that are  very important for my future career. I'm so excited and curious about modelling and wetlab  and so I am very happy to be part of the iGEM. I love swimming, biking and reading articles  about genetic and diseases.
Doğa Bingöl
Hi everyone, my name is Doğa Bingöl. I am a senior student at biology departmant. I have participated in iGEM because I have decided to experience my theoritical knowledge in wetlab. Moreover, I want to make new friendships. Before iGEM I had participated in another lab which includes effects of stress on mice. This research is very enjoyable because I love spending time with animals. My hobbies are reading novels and writing some short stories. I also like hanging my friends. See you soon
Duygu Vonal
Hi everyone. I am Duygu VONAL, a third year student in Chemistry Education  department of METU. This is my first year in iGEM. I am so excited to be member of iGEM  team. I think participating in a project will help me to improve myself in terms of different ways.  Especially, wetlab part of this system caught my attention. Also , I believe that I can help my  friends in terms of supplying needed chemicals or synthesis of them. This team will improve  me both technical and interpersonal ways.
Helin Tercan
Hello folks! It’s Helin Tercan here. I’m a third year Molecular Biology and Genetics student. This is my second year at iGEM. For me iGEM means being with friends and having fun. Of course fun is not what iGEM is all about, it also requires lots of research and lab work. I take part in mostly wetlab. Besides iGEM and synthetic biology, I really enjoy reading science fiction and cooking for loved ones. That’s all for now :3
Gökberk Kaya
Hi everybody! It's Gökberk Kaya here. This is my second year in Biology department. That is my first year in iGEM team. I am looking forward to being a part of such a great organization. To have the opportunity to experience new stuff in Biology and to contribute to the teamwork led me to join iGEM team. My field of interest in Biology is Biochemistry and Neurology, I hope someday, I can contribute to these fields. Moreover, I like reading and exploring new habitats. Good luck to all teams which are in iGEM 2015 contest, see you soon.
Bengisu Molyer
Hello! I’m Bengisu Molyer. I am a second year molecular biology and genetics  student at METU. Ever since I was a kid I was really interested in biology so I am  really happy to be here. This is my first year in iGEM and I am really excited to be  a part of it. By working hard with my teammates, I know we will come up with  something amazing! I also enjoy reading, singing and playing the piano. I hope to  meet you all at the jamboree :)
Gökalp Yıldırır
Hey everyone! This is Gokalp, a second year student at Molecular Biology and Genetics in METU.  This is my first year at iGEM and I am interested in Modeling and WetLab and the Wiki.  Biology makes me perceive the world in an alternative way and I realize how  significant (but not as significant as we think) we human beings really are.  Besides iGEM, I like playing saxophone, cycling and reading. I LOVE traveling to  new countries. Hope to see you there, gorusuruz!
Yağmur Berfin Yazan
Hi there! I am a senior student in biology. I love to work in laboratory, I try to help people as much as I can and I care about environment. iGEM combines all, and that is why i joined iGEM. I take part in wetlab and human pracitce mainly. I am a performer in a theater named ""Fareler Tiyatrosu"". I am learning to play bridge. Also, I like to learn new languages. Good luck to all!
Öykü Ece Tosun
Hello humans! Öykü Ece Tosun is talking :) It is my first year in molecular biology and genetics department and also it is my very first year in iGEM, too. Being member of this kind of team is amazing. I always love working together and doing scientific things with team. Mostly these parts attracts me, but also MIT part should not be forgotten! :)) I will work in wetlab and modelling, I guess because I already know something about wetlab and I continue to learn about it during my education, but modelling is a different unexplored area for me and I'm very curious about it. Besides iGEM and science, I really enjoy painting. In fact, I intend to be an artist like Salvador Dali but without moustache :-}) I hope to see you in Boston!
Ekin Özsüle
Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears; My name is Ekin Özsüle. I'm a second year Biology student. This is my first year in iGEM. I always want to be a part of a lab and do some science even I was a little child. When I was a child I always read, do some little experiments like burning house, poking wasp nests, drowning in a lake, eating poisonous plants etc. And now I have a perfect opportunity to do something crazy. I love all things that are related with science. I also love history, science, literature, science, gaming, science, learning new things and science. Did I mention science?
Dilara İşbaşarır
Hello everyone. I’m Dilara İşbaşarır. I’m a third year biology student in METU. The idea of the being a part of a study  which aims to be beneficial for humans and environment really fascinates me and I think iGEM is one  of the best places as a start point to achieve this. Therefore, I joined to iGEM this year. The working  in such a team provides very different insights and makes easier to improve ourselves in many areas.  I take part in wetlab and Human Practice. In my spare time, I enjoy learning Japanese, reading belles- lettres and hanging with my friends. I wish good luck to all teams.
Çiğdem Yılmaz
Hi there! I am Çiğdem Yılmaz and I’m dealing with the experiments to get a PhD degree in METU, Biology Department. I've come a long way up here and I’m still making my way with an endless curiosity which is the reason why we all try to change the world for the better. As an assistant advisor of this iGEM team consisting of creative and smart students, I’m trying to do my best as far as possible.  Good luck to all iGEMers and don’t forget that: ‘’if there is a will, there is a way..’’
Melike Dönertaş
Hi! This is Melike, M.Sc. Biology student and iGEM Modelling Team advisor. This is fifth iGEM team that I'm involved in and as usual I had so much fun working with such a creative & open-minded team. I hope all iGEMers will always find something to improve/re-design in life. Best wishes!
Elif Özçelik
Hi guys! I am Elif Özcelik and I am a student at department of molecular biology and genetics. This is my third year in this department and first year in iGEM. I am happy to work for iGEM. When I was a little, daydreamer child, I thought a person who creates things, works in a laboratory and devotes whole life to science should live in a science fiction book, and this thought made me excited for such a life. Now, as a university student, I know this dream is not so far for me. Of course, this is not a science fiction book :) but iGEM provides me a huge step to living for science. Spending nights at laboratory, making researches during whole free times and repeat procedures again and again are hard sometimes for some of us, even for me. I neglected painting and fencing but still iGEM gives a giant pleasure to create some good things (like painting and I hope it will give a success and proud that a professional fencer feels through her veins). Thank you, iGEM to help me live in one of my childhood dream."

Interlab Study Procedure
Protocol:
1. Transform the genetic parts from the BioBrick 2015 kit into TOP10 E. coli cells. BioBrick assembly was used to engineer the InterLab study devices. Refer to the BioBrick website for more information on assembly procedure: http://parts.igem.org/Assembly:Standard_assembly .
2. Streak out an agar plate (LB/CAM)  with the E. coli containing the device and any controls
- streak out one plate/device and control
- incubate plates overnight (18-20 hours) at 37°C
- “negative or background” Control: Cell background control (TOP10 cells)
- Negative Control: LB only control
Inoculate liquid culture with experimental devices (in triplicate) and controls in test tube in 10 ml LB/CAM media
Incubate liquid cultures for 16-18 hours at 300 rpm in 37°C
Plate Reader Measurement Protocol:
- Obtain initial OD600 measurement of O/N cultures
- Dilute the samples to an OD600 of 0.5
- calculate the dilution needed for each sample
- dilute each sample
- Re-measure your sample on OD600 to make sure it is at least within 5% of 0.5
Measure your samples
- add 80ul of each sample to the wells of a clear-bottomed 96 well plate
- The 96-well plate was inserted into an Infinite 200 PRO Microplate Reader
- Then, using the Tecan i-control the proper settings were selected and recorded.
- The Settings were: Excitation at 480 nm (9 nm width) and Emission at 525 nm (20 nm width) with optimal gain.
Calculate standard deviation and mean across triplicates of each device
Flow Cytometry Protocol:
(needs to be filled out)
Extra Credit:
Three technical replicates of the experiment were recorded where the measurements were repeated. The experimental samples were measured at least three times with both the plate reader and flow cytometer. Furthermore, we conducted three days of measurements to observe any possible genetic breaking of the devices to confirm our hypothesis that the strongest promoter will confer the most metabolic load on the organism, which can cause loss-of-function mutations within the plasmid.
Protocol for further measurement of biological triplicates and technical replicates over the course of three days: </br>
Day 0:
- Streak out frozen stock on plate
- Use the inoculation loop to streak out your cells onto LB/CAM plate.
- Incubate your plate at 37°C overnight for at least 20 hours.
Day 1:
- Pick 3 independent colonies and start three 5 ml O/N cultures in LB/CAM media.
- Grow overnight at 37°C and at 200-225RPM
Day 2:
- Start fresh 1:1000 dilution 5 ml cultures for each O/N culture.
- vortex the culture to generate an homogenous mixture
- Remove 250 µl from each O/N culture
- Use 5 µl of this for your fresh O/N culture
- Measure fluorescence intensity for your cultures with Flow Cytometer
- From the remaining culture in the Eppendorf, add 200 µl to a well within our 96 well plate.
Day 3:
- Repeat the procedure for Day 2
- Record the fluorescence readings and Flow Cytometer from the previous day"

SUPERVISION
GENERAL SUPPORT
Kara Helmke is the team advisor and coordinator and has helped with planning and execution of this project. She helped the team on a day-to-day basis in training, designing experiments, interpreting results, troubleshooting, and coordinating all of the individual efforts into a team result. Wendell Lim is the faculty advisor for the 2015 UCSF iGEM team and was involved in the conception of this year’s project, based on prior work (Youk and Lim 2014). His lab is the host for the team and he has graciously supported them with time, materials, and guidance. Gianne Souza is an education intern and helped the team with the day-to-day work in the lab, including experimental design and troubleshooting. She also heavily focused on scientific communication by working with the students on presentation skills and helping them get into the background information by leading a weekly journal club on relevant literature. Anusuya Ramasubramanian has helped advise the team in the big picture planning and execution of their device, and is a whiz at writing and scientific communication, so she always provides insightful comments and edits to all written and spoken communications!
MODELING SUPPORT
Kevin Hartman was heavily involved in teaching computation -- both by leading instructional classes in Matlab and data analysis, as well as spearheading the modeling small groups to build a computational model of the team’s project. The modeling effort was also co-led by Weiyue Ji and Marco Mravic.
OTHER SUPPORT
Several mentors participated as instructors during the first week of Bootcamp to help prep the team on the background information and techniques necessary for executing their projects. Those amazing mentors are: Marco Mravic, Kevin Hartman, Zairan Liu, Alain Bonny, Anusuya Ramasubramanian, Dan Santos, Weiyue Ji, and Justin McLaurin. Many of these same mentors attended weekly group meetings and gave the team feedback to help them improve.
OTHER ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
Our project concept about cellular divergence drew heavy inspiration from the UCSF UCB 2014 iGEM Team's project on cellular convergence. We based our initial circuit off of their design and modified it downstream to suit our needs. Our wiki was also inspired by both the UCSF UCB 2014 team and the LMU-Munich 2014 team. We drew inspiration from UCSF UCB's crisp clean design and navigation along with LMU-Munich's use of a large skyline image for their homepage. We would also like to give special thanks to Russell Gordley for allowing us to use his chimeric LexADBD transcription factor and LexAOps promoter. Additionally, we are thankful for the Lim Lab's generous support in providing lab space and materials. Lastly, we would like to thank our sponsors for their support and funding that made this research possible.

Meet the team
The UMaryland iGEM Team consists of 15 undergraduate students in the University, all from various science backgrounds.
Iowis Zhu: President, Fearless Leader
4th year: Biochemistry, Molecular Genetics, Public Leadership, Statistics, Tech. Entrepreneurship
""No worries, it'll be fine.""
After leading last year's inaugural iGEM team to a gold award last year, Iowis returned this year to further grow the team. Outside of iGEM, he studies the characteristics of DNA looping protein in Dr. Kahn's lab. He has had the entire periodic table memorized since 8th grade. Outside of lab, he loves reading manga, watching sports (as a Boston sports fan), and following the global politics. He recently visited India last winter and Germany last summer. After graduation he plans to enter MD/PhD program.
Stephanie Sansbury: Vice President, Team Mom
4th year: Microbiology, Arabic Studies
""I'm gonna science as hard as I can!""
Stephanie is a senior at the University of Maryland researching mechanosensitive channels in V. cholerae. When she's not in the lab, you can find her wandering organic farms trying to find my spirit animal or exploring the rocky paths of the local Billy Goat Trail along the Potomac River. In addition to basic scientific research, she is interested in science education and policy and plans to work in that arena after earning her PhD.
Kevin Fan: Finance Director, Tallest Asian
4th year: Neurobiology, Technology Entrepreneurship
""Can I eat that?""
Standing at 190 cm, Kevin is the tallest Asian on the team. He joined iGEM because of its fast-paced, multidisciplinary, problem solving nature, as well as its connections to entrepreneurship. He is the founder of SuperScore Inc, and serves on the national board of Kids Are Scientists Too. He hopes to attain a MD/MBA someday. In his spare time, Kevin enjoys boxing, parkour, and reading.
Robert Hand: Community/Outreach Director
3rd year: Bioengineering
""Always happy to lend a hand.""
Rob is currently a junior bioengineering major. He joined iGEM because of its innovative, creative nature and how it addresses so many different aspects of synthetic biology. Outside of the iGEM lab and our human practices efforts, he enjoys reading about virtually anything, learning about vegetarian cooking recipes, being out in nature,  exploring my new found hobby of SCUBA diving with the Maryland Terrafins, exploring, learning about issues in Bioethics, and spending time with his wonderful friends.
Chun Mun Loke: Website Director, Best Kohai
2nd year: Biochemistry, Molecular Genetics, Physics, Music
""Has Iowis-senpai noticed me yet?""
Hailing from Singapore and Australia, Chun Mun's strong interest in genetic engineering prompted him to join iGEM. He hopes to conduct research in this field after attaining an MD/PhD. Outside of school, he is a self proclaimed piano prodigy, having won consecutive local competitions and finalising in international ones. He can solve a Rubik's cube in a very slow average of 17 seconds and is an avid video gamer. He is actually not a weeaboo as some aspects of his profile may suggest.
Aditya Biswas: PCR Design Director
4th year: Bioengineering
""My PCR machine doubles as a hairdryer.""
Aditya is a senior at the University of Maryland who is studying Bioengineering. Aditya brings 5 years of wet lab research experience including one prior year with Maryland's IGEM team. This year Aditya's main project is in the design of a cheap and effective PCR machine, and modeling metabolic pathways of engineered E.coli. In his free time Aditya enjoys the movies, making food for the team, and visiting cows.

It’s me Nida Amin from Pakistan, I am member of the IGEM team 2015 and responsible for the wet lab work. I had completed my Bachelors in Zoology last year from University of the Punjab, Lahore, Pakistan. My goodluck started last year when I was selected on EXPERTS III scholarship as Master’s exchange student from Pakistan to study in Microbiology and Biochemistry program of Georg-August- Universität, Göttingen, Germany. The combination of my Bachelor’s degree with this current Master’s program and especially membership of this team, provides me the platform to excel in my desired area and achieve my goals of becoming a little scientist in future. It was my wish to enhance my own knowledge and to do research work in a competitive environment where I will effectively utilizes my analytical, interpersonal skills to reach the pinnacle of success and with the passage of time every wish is coming true.
Interesting fact:
I feel very lucky because from my school life to uptill now my parents don’t have to pay for my studies because Its my record to be on scholarship for each degree due to my hardwork.

Dennis Twesmann
Dennis Twesmann
About you:
My name is Dennis Twesmann, I am from Germany and currently participating in the Master’s program “Microbiology and Biochemistry” at the Georg-August-University of Göttingen. I obtained my bachelor’s degree in molecular biosciences there, too. During my bachelor thesis in the department of molecular structural biochemistry, I established a purification protocol for the spliceosomal DEAD box RNA helicase Prp28 from the thermophilic eukaryote Chaetomium thermophilum in order to investigate its structure by means of X-ray crystallography. The work in this field reflects my general interest in understanding the functions of enzymes on a molecular level as well as the underlying biological chemistry, done by these greatest chemists on earth. That is one of the reasons I joined the iGEM team 2015 pursuing a project where distinct enzymatic activities, brought together in a “Flexosome”, play a major role. So far, I inter alia helped to develop the booklet of our project in order to find sponsors and I am currently within the long-winded process of solving the practical implementation of our project in the lab.

Julian Schwanbeck
About you:
Hi there, my name is Julian Schwanbeck. Originally from Hamburg, I obtained my bachelor’s degree here in the Georg-August Universität Göttingen in the field of Microbiology, mainly by failing to find a new trans-membrane transporter in Mycoplasma pneumoniae. I am also with the organisation committee. iGEM interested me mostly, as planning, organising and undertaking an own research project is something an ordinary masters student usually doesn’t get to experience. I am mostly interested in learning new methods as well as planning the experimental setup efficiently. During the weekends, I like to play with our dog in Hamburg.
Interesting fact:
I enjoy writing lab journal entries and repairing keyboards more than writing a short passage about myself.

General Support
Professor Dr. Uwe Sonnewald turned out to be the first person to support our iGEM vision. Giving us our lab spaces and getting the Department of Biology behind our project was an enormous help to us. Regularly, he checks up on us to ask if everything is going all right. In addition, he helped us with lab materials and financially.
Lab support
Marlene Pröschel, a PhD student in the Division of Biochemistry, introduced us to the different labs and surroundings. She was our go to person when it came to any questions, be it either theoretical or practical. Moreover, she lent us a hand in the lab on some occasions (e.g. rpd3 overlap PCR).
Thanks to the Division of Molecular Plant Physiology (MPP) for letting us use their confocal laser scanning microscope to analyse our YFP expressing yeast.
Project advisor support
Professor Dr. Christian Koch was our specialist when it came to yeast knowledge. While always staying interested as well as enthusiastic, he also provided us with more lab space and materials. Prof. Koch's never ending expertise gave us great insight into homologous recombination, promotors, plasmids and literature.
Wiki page layout support
This Wiki Page layout was in large parts copied from the 2014 Team from SDU Denmark , which itself is also based on the 2013 Team from Denmark under the CC license . There have been several styling adjustments to make it optically distinguishable from their wiki, but the core concept remains the same. Initially, we planned to make our own layout, but as no one of our team has ever done any webpage development, we had to adapt and only make small changes to an already existing layout.
Team logo design
We are the first team of FAU Erlangen to participate in iGEM, so we didn't have a logo yet. Hence Andreas Feser from Team Marburg offered us to design our logo and he did a great job!

Meet Our Team
Students
Hi! I am Bill, a Year 4 student studying bioengineering. Living in the moment is my life attitude. I am always looking for ways to get out of my comfort zone so that I can explore my interests and abilities. Genetic engineering is fascinating to me because DNA sequences reveal the secret of biogenesis. Throughout the project, I had the chance to perform lab work, research about biosafety concerns as well as characterize some of our constructs. iGEM provided me with a unique and fulfilling learning experience. I believe that this experience has given me the confidence to share my ideas and make them a reality.
Hello! I’m Aruna and I’m a third-year student in Applied Biology. My main role in the team is to research the biosafety aspects of our project and complete the parts registry while simultaneously performing lab work. The iGEM experience has been transformative and a great learning opportunity. I am glad to have been able to contribute to the team and to our project.
I am Ava, a Year 3 student majoring in Applied Biology. Being a researcher in the field of biology is my dream and personal goal. I enjoy the process of scientifically finding the answer to a question. The iGEM competition is an invaluable opportunity for me to acquire more research experience in the field of synthetic biology.
I am Effie, a Year 3 Applied Biology student. I am an approachable person and also a good listener. Anyone is welcome to share their thoughts with me. I contributed to the team working on the Interlab study while also constructing our biobricks. iGEM provided me with a valuable chance to learn the basics of synthetic biology and to meet great people. Turning ideas into reality is also a new learning experience for me.
Hello. I am Esther, a Year 3 student majoring in Applied Biology. Genetics is my favourite field in biology because it demonstrates how complexity can arise from the simplest entity.  My responsibility in the team is to keep everyone updated with news from the iGEM headquarters so that we don’t miss any deadlines. iGEM has been a precious experience. Besides a marked improvement on pipetting skills, I have learned to troubleshoot problems when they arise.
I am Jeanie, a year 3 student from Applied Biology. Genetics is fascinating. It is amazing that complex genetic information is only recorded by 4 types of nucleotides.  A single nucleotide change can make a great difference. This is enchanting to me. The iGEM competition has provided me the opportunity to apply what I have learnt from class to real life. I contributed to the team through cloning our cassettes, and maintaining the lab log. In addition to improving my laboratory skills, iGEM was an invaluable chance to work with my lovely groupmates throughout summer.
Joe
Bioengineering, Final Year
I am a final year bioengineering student. After studying engineering for 3 years and working in a neuroengineering lab for 1.5 years, I decided to join iGEM to explore the field of genetics - one of the two fields in biology I love most (the other one is neural science and engineering). Even though I don’t have much prior experience or knowledge about genetics I was able to pick up the theory and skills quickly because I am a hand’s on learner. I believe my previous research experience, mathematical sense, logical thinking, engineering mindset, and proficiency in Excel and Matlab enabled me to contribute to the team. This was the first time I worked with so many science students  as a team. By doing so, I learn how powerful it is to cooperate with people from different disciplines. In addition to doing lab work, I was responsible for building the team Wiki, making computer simulations as well as characterising our lysis cassette constructs. I am also a member of the Presentation team.

Hi, my name is Mandy! I am a Year 3 Applied Biology student. I have an interest in biology because it has lead to amazing and fascinating discoveries that help us further understand life. I am most interested in applying special animal characteristics to commercial products that will benefit society. iGEM is an attractive competition through which I was able to learn  the basics synthetic biology and  useful laboratory skills. I was able to put my knowledge of graphic design to create various graphics for our poster and Wiki. It is a great opportunity to compete with universities around the world. It is no doubt that iGEM will be the greatest success in my university life.
Hi, I am Ma Lee, a student studying Applied Biology. You can call me Mary as well. Manipulating genes is such an amazing ability. Who hasn’t dream about it in their childhood? When I was young, I thought this would be the power of some mutants that only appear in comic books. But now, with the power of science, everyone can manipulate genes. That's the reason I joined iGEM -- to learn this power and spread this knowledge to the general public. My responsibilities in this team are to do lab work, complete forms and remind everyone of deadlines. Such a relaxing job. :)
Hi, I am Siu Ho Ming. The opportunity to be a part of CityU iGEM team has been worthwhile and valuable.  I have particular interest in discovering and learning whatever my curiosity brings upon me. I enjoy science because it has no constraints. Innovation is to creativity what sugar is to coffee -they are the major components that make science.   It is definitely my honor to work with my team over the past few months. We stood by each other through thick and thin. Nothing would have been possible without everyone’s contribution. My contribution was the development of two new games for our Human Practices and construction of several lysis cassettes.
I’m Peter, a year 3 student studying Applied Biology. Nothing can fascinate me as much as life science. Countless human inventions and designs are inspired by nature. To me, the most compact natural storage system is the genome. iGEM provided me with an opportunity to create our own project and modify this product of Mother Nature. I appreciate the complexity of the genome. I have given by best to characterize the lysis cassettes and designing the team Wiki.
Hi! My name is Rocky. I am currently a high school senior studying at the International Christian School of Hong Kong. Over the summer, I had the privilege of working alongside the CityU iGEM team. Throughout my time with the team, I learnt many useful things about working in a lab and how to work towards a goal as a team. I sincerely hope my experience will take me to new heights in the future.
I am Tina. I have had a meaningful summer with the other team members. Putting what I have learnt to good use gives me contentment as an engineer in the making. Joining CityU iGEM team was a groundbreaking experience for me. It was exciting to put our innovative ideas into practical use. I have gained a whole new level of understanding about the world of biology, while gaining a lot of valuable knowledge and hands-on experience. These are things that will benefit my whole life.
Hello! I am Tommy. This is a very precious opportunity to gather people who share similar interests to work together as a team - a team which cares for each other while exploring and learning. The iGEM competition means a lot to me. I was able to apply my knowledge from school to real life. The experience of working as a team and communicating with each other is priceless. I am very glad that I have been given the opportunity to be one of the team members of the CityU iGEM team this year.
Hello. I am Oscar Chan, a third-year Applied Biology student. iGEM is actually the first serious scientific project I have been involved in. In the past, my perception of science was only limited to theories in books, but with iGEM, I can finally get my hands dirty. My main responsibilities were to characterize the genes and to create graphics, both of which were more challenging than I expected. However, this is also why I love science. Despite limitations and difficulties, scientists strive to dig out the truth and utilize their discoveries to make the world a better place. The satisfaction it brings is incomparable.

My duty is to ensure the iGEMers can get all the necessities for their experiments and to give technical support when they encounter difficulty. It is awesome to work with all the iGEMers and I really enjoy every minute with the team. I hope my limited experience in biology research can help the team and make things a little bit easier.
Marco So
Molecular biologists are gift takers. Nature, through millions of years of evolution, has given us the best gift --- countless combinations and varieties of genes. We, the ambitious scientists, are trying to make even more out of it - putting together ingenious pieces to help our species live better, if not the whole world’s ecosystem. Last year, I was one of the innocent teens that stepped into this playground. Today, I am a mentor of the Breaking Lac team. Position changed, passion stays.
Maria Li
Ciao a tutti! I’m Maria. Last year, I was a student member of the 2014 CityU_HK iGEM team. iGEM offers me a lot of chances to open my eyes. This year I’m glad to keep living in the iGEM spirit as a mentor of the Breaking Lac team. I love to explore innovative stuff and to apply science concepts to improve human lives. Since building the wiki for my iGEM team last year, I have fallen in love with programming. I believe integrating programming and biology can create fascinating innovations.
Venus Wong
I am the assistant of the CityU iGEM this year. I am glad that I can become part of the team. While helping them, I was surprised by their insistence and creativity, despite having no prior knowledge of synthetic biology.

Miya Coimbra
I am a junior at Canyon Crest Academy and my interest in bioengineering led me to my involvement in iGEM since sophomore year. Although when we first started the project we had thought it would be mostly wet lab work, it turned into a computational project, which has been a great experience. iGEM has exposed me to another side of bioengineering: the computational aspect. Learning how to use programs such as VMD and NAMD to simulate how molecules interact with one another especially interested me. It was a different way of conducting research that I hadn’t thought of pursuing before. In the future, I would like to continue to study in the STEM field with computational modelling as an important aspect in my research.
Julia Wisnia
I am a rising junior at Canyon Crest Academy.  My passion for biological sciences lead me to iGEM; I was excited to engage in the topics my advisors study.  This year I was introduced to computational methods for performing experiments that I had recently thought to be strictly wet lab.  Our mentors taught us to use programs such as VMD (Visual Molecular Dynamics) to model glucose and its sensor in a variety of environments.  I hope to continue on to the biomedical engineering field using both classical and computational approaches.  I would like to continue to pursue the construction of new biosensors in my future work.
Olivia Shiah
I am a junior at Canyon Crest Academy. I have always had a passion for biology, and iGEM provided me with a chance to experience the process which researchers go through when developing and testing new biosensors. iGEM also introduced me to the computational aspect of biology, a field I had not been familiar with prior to joining the team. The project allowed me to observe the efficiency in which VMD and NAMD were able to accurately portray molecules in numerous conditions, a part of our project which captured my interest. iGEM has encouraged me to pursue my interest in biology, particularly the computational aspect.
Maggie Chen
I am a sophomore at Canyon Crest Academy. With an interest in the medical sciences and a strong affinity for engineering, I found the iGEM team to be both educational and inspirational in every aspect. It has been incredible to discover the sheer power of computational techniques; the programs that we use have the ability to model scenarios, screen drug molecules, and calculate various drug levels. iGEM helped me discover the beauty of combining different techniques to achieve a common goal. In the future, I hope to study medicine while still conducting research.
Amanda Matheson
Now entering my senior year of high school at Canyon Crest Academy, I have been involved in iGEM since I was a sophomore. With a lifelong love of biology, mathematics, and helping others, I have found synthetic biology in general and the iGEM program in particular to act as an ideal medium by which to explore all of my interests, as well as to help advance knowledge in the scientific and medical fields. I have particularly enjoyed understanding the underlying reasoning patterns through which programs such as VMD and NAMD are able to accurately model inter- and intramolecular interactions.
Ariel Braunstein
I am a senior at Canyon Crest Academy. My existing passion for biology grew this summer through iGEM. I joined iGEM because it gave me the opportunity to learn both wet lab techniques, as well as to do research on subjects that interested us. iGEM also introduced me to the computational side of the biological sciences and the way that programs like NAMD (Nanoscale Molecular Dynamics) can be used in conjunction with traditional wet lab methods to do research. My experience with synthetic biology during the iGEM competition has led me to look for universities with synthetic biology programs for my undergraduate degree.
Vivian Patton
I am entering my junior at Canyon Crest Academy. Prior to joining iGEM, I had a strong interest in biology. I found iGEM to be the ideal place to extend my knowledge in this field at a computational and experimental level. Through iGEM, I was able to observe, learn, and master the techniques of synthetic biology. Additionally, there was an outreach program associated with our project that I thoroughly enjoyed, as I was able to work with kids. In the future, I would love to pursue a career in the medical field.
Ravi Agarwal
Now a Senior at Canyon Crest Academy, over the past three years I have had the privilege to work with some of the best scientific minds in San Diego including numerous hours working in wet labs performing various tasks. Additionally, I have also shadowed world renowned physicians, observing their every motion trying to understand the complexities of their profession and every thought process that goes into their decision making. As such, it is no surprise that I thoroughly enjoy the sciences and any intellectual pursuit for that matter. The iGem program, which I have been affiliated with since my Junior year, has truly allowed me to branch out of the wet lab environment and apply what has been taught to me in school to both medicine and further understanding of the science. iGem truly exposed me to a new side of of bioengineering, and science itself for that matter, of the theoretical practices that can be played out in computational biology through programs such as VMD and NAMD, simulating the nuances behind molecular behavior. Going forward in my educational career, one that will ultimately end up with my being a physician, I would certainly like to continue applying and furthering the knowledge that I ascertained through my experience in iGem to enhance my scientific pursuits, both in practice and research.
Harrison Harris
I am a Senior at Canyon Crest Academy.  I’ve done many things in my life, including living on my own when I was 16 years old,  yet I found iGEM to be very inspiring.  It’s amazing to see so many people having a love for making everyone’s lives just a little bit better.  In this cynical world, iGEM is truly one good step forward for humanity.  Having the pleasure to work with and observe both the high school and graduate students has given me a lot to think about my future in Medical Science.

Erinn Eddingfield
This is my second year as a science teacher at CCA, and I have taught biology, chemistry, and marine biology in the classroom for 8 years.  I love being a part of the Raven family and look forward to settling in further. My primary goal as a science teacher is for all students (no matter the subject) to expand their SCIENCE skills (scientific reading/writing, practical lab skills, observation, inference, etc) through the avenue of the subject at hand.  Anyone in this era of Google has the ability to look up pieces of biology or chemistry information easily on the internet, but many people are deficient in their ability to analyze the information and the credibility of scientific knowledge that they have access to on the web or in the news.  Secondarily, students will leave my mentorship with knowledge of the subject that will serve as a strong foundation for success in AP science courses, college courses, standardized science tests, or the workplace."

About us
About the first Slovenian high school iGEM team
We are a high school research group composed of 8 biology and chemistry  enthusiasts. As we attend 7 different secondary educational institutions across all  Slovenia we are a very diverse team. We are all honoured to be the first Slovenian  high school team to take part in the iGEM HS competition and face the challenges  the synthetic biology poses.
''Alone we can do so little; together we can do so much''
-Helen Keller
We joined our knowledge and experience under the supervision of the National  Institute of Chemistry Slovenia and the Chair of Biochemistry of the Faculty of  Chemistry and Chemical Technology of the University Ljubljana, who also selected  the team members among 32 applicants. For the application procedure we had to  write a personal statement about our passion for this area of research, attend an  interview and work out a thorough project design challenge.  As we are still only high school students with very little experience in synthetic  biology we could not start working on our project straight away (even though we  wanted to). Instead, we had to sit a few lessons first.  Throughout these we extended our knowledge on our field of work by learning the  basics of biotechnology, synthetic biology, lab safety and by practicing basic lab  protocols.
Because of the complexity of our project we formulated 2 working groups afterwards:
Synthetic biologists, who were responsible for building our construct by using principles of synthetic biology.
Biotechnologists, who aimed to find the optimal conditions under which our construct would produce the highest possible yield of biobutanol within our genetically modified and optimized bioreactor system
The synthetic biologists carried out their wet-lab research at the Faculty of Chemistry  and Chemical Technology while the biotechnologists preformed their research at the  National Institute of Chemistry. At the same tame we held all-group meetings to  share our results and experience and work on our project thoroughly.

Why are you interested in synthetic biology?
I am interested in synthetic biology because of the promising improvements and facilitation of daily life situations. In synthetic biology there is still so much unknown and undiscovered and I wish to narrow that gap. The favorite part of our project was learning about genetic modification and when the first electrophoresis was done. It fascinates me that we can basically modify them in almost any way imaginable, change and cut DNA sequences. I found great passion, happiness and inspiration in chemistry and biology and synthetic biology partially combines both of the above mentioned sciences. But the crucial and the key thing is that besides all the research we do, we widen our knowledge and our horizons, search for new, alternative, better and more effective solutions for the problems, which pest the society nowadays.

Safety
When working in any laboratory, even if it is only your school`s chemistry lab, safety should  undoubtedly be your main concern.  Work safety includes everything from proper  equipment such as protective gloves, glasses, lab coat etc., to adequate preparations and  proper disposal of chemicals and organisms.
Our experience with lab safety
Prior to this project we had already worked in a laboratory, either at school, in a research  facility or in some other way. This way we had acquired a lot of experience in this field and  were fully aware the importance of lab safety. It is a responsibility you have towards yourself  and others working with you.
That is why before even stepping into a laboratory we had a mandatory work and laboratory  safety lecture at the National Institute of Chemistry. We revised and upgraded our previous  knowledge on this topic and after passing the exam we were fully prepared and educated on  the topic of safe laboratory work. Prof. dr. Marko Dolinar, a member of the Slovene Scientific  committee for work with GMOs in contained use, gave us a lecture on genetically modified  organism and concerns regarding their use and safety. Additionally, we also watched two  educational videos, which were provided to us by iGEM and gave us further information on  how to work with living microorganism and how to handle GMOs.
Chemicals
We mostly dealt with chemicals which are in general safe, for example agarose and peptone,  but in case of chemicals such as butyric acid, hydrochloric acid, sodium hydroxide and  ethidium bromide, special caution was required. When handling with ethidium bromide,  which is considered mutagen, carcinogen and teratogen, we were especially careful. We  consistently used the stronger (purple) nitrile gloves and were cautious not to touch  unnecessary objects when using them to prevent contamination of surfaces and equipment  with ethidium bromide and maintain the required level of safety. In any case, ethidium  bromide can only be used in the so-called 'electrophoresis lab'. No equipement or  consumables used for work with ethidium bromide is allowed to leave this lab (except for  waste sealed in a bag).
Organisms
We worked in a Level 1 laboratory, because all the organism (Escherichia coli and Clostridium  acetobutylicum) and parts we were using fall into this biosafety category. Both bacteria are  safe to use since they pose a minimal potential threat to people in the laboratory and do not  consistently cause disease in healthy adults. Nevertheless, we were precautious and used  proper disinfectant to clean the laminar flow cabinet and other working areas as some of the  E. coli we were using during our research was of course genetically modified.  Working in a dedicated molecular biology lab our working space is separate from the rest of  the facility. Our lab is a part of a department which again is separated from the rest of the  building by a door that locks automatically, so that the access to the department is  controlled. Work was preformed on an open lab table. Personal protective gear (lab coat and  gloves) was worn at all times and was supplemented with eye and ear protection as needed  (for example for work with UV light or sonication).  All liquid waste was autoclaved before  being discharged. Solid waste was collected separately and disposed by inicineration by an  independent  contractor. A sink for hand washing and 70% ethanol was available for  sterilisation at all times if needed.
Butanol
Butanol as our main product, when produced in adequate quantities, would be used in  standard Otto gasoline engines as a propellant. Since this engine is one of two most common  engines, the other one being the diesel engine, we had to consider several aspects of  butanol`s broad use, including safety and possible impact it would have on the environment.
Butanol is according to the CDC harmful to health.  It causes  damage if inhaled, ingested or if it comes in contact with skin or eyes. Inhalation of vapours  may cause headache, nausea, drowsiness and dizziness and irritation of the respiratory tract.  Ingestion may result in vomiting, nausea, diarrhoea, abdominal pain, dizziness and  drowsiness. Exposure to the eyes and skin causes irritation, redness and pain.
1-Butanol has low water solubility, is biodegradable and therefore not expected to  significantly accumulate in nature. In open spaces, at normal temperature, 1-butanol  decomposes due to photolysis. It is a combustible and flammable liquid, sensible to static  discharges. Flash point of butanol is 29°C so spontaneous ignition is possible on hot days.
But compared to gasoline butanol is much safer to use. Gasoline is more hazardous to health  as butanol, because in addition to skin, eye and respiratory irritation, dizziness and  drowsiness, it is also mutagenic, carcinogenic and toxic to reproduction, causes damage to  organs (liver, kidneys, bladder, blood, bone marrow, nervous system) through prolonged or  repeated exposure and may be fatal if swallowed or inhaled. Gasoline`s flash point is -43°C  and as such significantly lower than the flash point of butanol. In addition gasoline poses a  greater threat to the environment than butanol, because it is poisonous to aquatic life. Gasoline safety sheet
To conclude, common use of butanol as a propellant may require certain safety precautions  during production, transportation and storage. Possible dangers of its use could be  eliminated with the same preventive measures that are already implemented for other  flammable liquid car fuels.
Butyric acid
Butyric acid is a medium-strong carboxylic acid. Because it is the first and most important  substrate of our engineered metabolic path, its dangers should be taken into consideration  before any large-scale production of butanol is established. Butyric acid is corrosive and can  cause pain, redness and severe deep burns on skin and loss of vision. If ingested, it can cause  abdominal pain, shock or collapse. Inhalation may result in sore throat, cough, burning  sensation, shortness of breath and laboured breathing. Butyric acid safety sheet It is  also combustible and forms explosive vapours above 72°C. With proper action these dangers  should be eliminated.

Heat shock protocol (transformation)
o Thaw competent cells on ice. Pipet 2 µl of DNA per 100 µl of competent cells.
o Incubate on ice for 30 minutes.
o Heat shock the mixture of competent bacteria cells and DNA by placing on  thermoblock or waterbath at 42°C for 45 seconds and then immediately place back  on ice for 5 minutes.
o Add 800 µL LB media to transformed cells. Incubate on 37°C for 30 min with  agitation.
Plasmid DNA purification using centrifuges
o Harvest your bacterial culture (3-10 ml) by centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 3 minutes  at room temperature. Decant the supernatant and remove remaining medium. All  other centrifugations should be carried out at 14 000 rpm at room temperature.
o Resuspend the pelleted cells in 250 µL of Resuspension Solution. The bacteria should  be resuspended completely by vortexing or pipetting up and down until no cells  clumps remain.
o Add 250 µL of the Lysis Solution and mix thoroughly by inverting the tube 4-6 times  until the solution becomes viscous and slightly clear.
o Add 350 µL of the Neutralization Solution and mix immediately and thoroughly by  inverting the tube 4-6 times.
o Centrifugate the mixture for 5 min.
o Transfer the supernatant to the supplied GeneJET spin column by decanting ot  pipetting. Avoid disturbing or transfering the white precipitate. Bag with Gene JET  Spin Columns must be closed tightly after each use.
o  Centrifuge the supernatant for 1 min. The flow-through should be discarded and the  column should be placed back into the same collection tube.
o Add 500 µL of the Wash Solution to the GeneJET spin column, centrifuge for 1  minute and discard the flow through, placing the column back into the same  collection tube. Repeat.
o Centrifugate the columns for additional 1 min to remove residual Wash Soulution.  This step is essential to avoid residual ethanol in plasmid preps.
o Transfer the GeneJET spin column should into a fresh 1,5 ml microcentrifuge tube.  Add 50 µL of the Elution Buffer to the center of GeneJET spin column membrane to  elute the plasmid DNA. The membrane must not be contacted with the pipette tip.  Incubated for 2 minutes at room temperature and centrifugate for 2 minutes.  Repeat.
o Discard the column and store the purified plasmid DNA at -20°C.

Our Journey
 
''If you want to go quickly, go alone. If you want to go far, go  together.''
- African proverb -
  The beginning of our journey
 
When we first saw that The National Institute of Chemistry was looking for team members  to present the colours of Slovenia iGEM HS Division, we thought it would be a great  opportunity to do what something we were interested in and learn something new. We  applied to the call for applications and hoped for the best. Parts of the application  procedure were writing a motivational letter, attending an interview, taking part in a  personality test and, the toughest of them all, solve a scientific problem.
 14 months ago, we knew nothing about synthetic biology because we only learned the  basics in our biology and chemistry classes. We had no clue how demanding the project is  going to be at the time.
Building a knowledge basis
 
When we started with our team meetings in September and October 2014,  we first had to  learn the basics of biochemistry and biotechnology.  Through autumn and winter we have  had having lessons two afternoons per week after school. We learned about cloning,  plasmids, PCR and biobricks. Moreover, we learned how to edit wiki pages, use  bioinformatics programs and data bases. At the same time we were also studying the  additional literature and developing our ideas. We learned about E. coli, conditions for its  optimal growth and bioreactors. Finally, we got to enter the labs where we practiced basic  lab techniques and protocols, such as pipetting with micropipettes. We also cut the vectors  with restriction enzymes for the first time and tested our samples using agarose gel  electrophoresis.  It needless to say how fascinated we were when we were actually able to  see several pieces of DNA of different lengths.  It was a great experience because we were tutored by university professors and scientists  who were really able to explain to us everything thoroughly.
So Let’s get to work!
 
Afterwards we decided to divide in two working groups: biotechnologists and synthetic  biologists. Biotechnologists worked under the supervision of The National Institute of  Chemistry while synthetic biologists worked under the supervision of The Faculty of  Chemistry and Chemical Technology. We also held regular team meetings during which we  organized our teamwork and exchanged our results and experience.
   When we first actually started working in the lab we wanted to obtain the genes needed for  building our construct from a mixed culture which we knew also contained Clostridium. We  wanted to do so because The Laboratory for Environmental Sciences and Engineering  already used this culture for their own experiments and we wanted to make use of it as  well. As our DNA purification from mixed culture was unsuccessful we decided to go a step  further and order pure culture and purify the DNA out of it. However, this was also  unsuccessful and we decided to order synthetic DNA segments from IDT Technologies.  These arrived in late June and since then we spent more or less every day in the lab.
  Summer of tears and sweat (and empty AGE gels)
We spent the following months sweating in the lab. Our days consisted of cloning, doing  colony PCRs, testing our samples, hoping for positive results of agarose gel electrophoresis  and crying as this was rarely the case. At the same time we prepared different mediums to  see what best suits for E. coli's growth, measured absorbance, worked in both aerobic and  anaerobic conditions (the following were especially fun), carried out the ecotoxicological  tests, isolated n-butanol, prepared different mediums again and analysed tons of results.
There is life outside the lab too…
 
Besides the lab work we also filmed a short clip about our project and presented our project  and principles of synthetic biology to a wider audience. We met the Slovenian prime  minister while doing so and made sure he understood what we were trying to accomplish. We established our very first crowdfunding campaign on Indiegogo, wrote articles,  collaborated with other iGEM teams, searched for sponsors and designed our wiki.
The lessons we learned
To be honest, we have never imagined how demanding it would be to manage such a  project. In fact, it turned out to be much more than just a scientific research. Being a part of  this project was a great opportunity to experience real-life scientific teamwork, develop  organisational and leadership skills. On the other hand we had to overcome a lot of obstacles, from having troubles with  bureaucracy to not being able to get our vectors into bacteriae. It was then when we  realized only we are the ones responsible for the project and that it is on us to reach out for  help. We learned that in the end you always have to do what you have to do, no matter how  hard it may seem. Perhaps the crucial lesson of this summer was about the importance of  collaboration with others or, to put it another way, to stick together through thick and  thin.

Collaboration with team Aachen
While we were working on our project, we had connected with several other iGEM teams. We  worked really well with a student team from Aachen, Germany. They had a similar topic as us, so  collaboration was easier due to common ground. Firstly, we had a few conference calls with them  and after exchanging our experience with already conducted research and preparations for iGEM, we  worked on possible ways to solve the problems we all pointed out. Furthermore we discussed other  ways of collaboration.  We helped them with their Human Practises by filling out their questionnaire  on lab organisation and also conducted several tests for them.
They were investigating the degree of GMO pollution in the laboratories we worked in, which is  indeed a valuable problem to explore. When dealing with something with such power to transform  the world as synthetic biology has, safety is very important, both in the outside world when we try to  apply our ideas to everyday lives and in the lab as well. GMO pollution in the lab is an important  question because it concerns our safety and the safety of other people we interact with, so we were  glad to be able to participate in their study.
We conducted several swab tests on different surfaces with agar chips by placing 3 on each selected  surface for 5 seconds and then placed them in petri dishes.  They were incubated at 37°C and after  24 hours we received the following results:
The agar chips were maid according to the protocol they have sent us:
•prepare 250 ml of LB medium with 2% Agar (2.5 g NaCl, 2.5 g Peptone/Tryptone, 1.25 g Yeast  extract, 5 g Agar),
•sterilize the black chip-mould by wiping it with 70 % Ethanol,
•fill the mould with hot LB and let it cool down for 1-10 minutes,
•use a sterile (wiped with Ethanol) scalpel to cut along the markings,
•move agar chips into sterile petri dishes with a spatula,
•store at 4 °C.
Collaboration with Aalto-Helsinki
We collaborated with Aalto_helsinki team as well. We contacted them because they were working  on a similar project we were working on: producing boifuel with the tools of synthetic biology. While  they focused on producing propanol, we focused on producing butanol.
We kept in touch regularly trought e-mail, but also held a skype conference, where we talked about  our projects and the ways we could help each other. We both ordered gene fragments from IDT and  talked about that expreience and we gave each other tips on how to best accomplish other tasks of  iGEM. At the time, Slovenia HS has already done some work on our Human Practices, such as  presentations for students and appearences in media, while Aalto-Helsinki was just starting to  prepare their Human Practices, so we talked and echanged information and ideas about that. On teh  other hand, aalto-Helsinki already had experience creating wiki pages (their team won the award for  best wiki in 2014), while Slovenia HS was beginning to learn, so we were glad to also be able to ask  some questions about creating wiki.
We did some work for them in the laboratory as well. Aalto-Helsinki sent us one of their BioBricks (BBa_K1655001) for validation and to be able to compare their results with ours.  This BioBrick is a GFP that can be fused into any protein's aminoterminal. We first attempted to  validate this brick by fusing it with one of our genes (CtfB) that was already tested and proved to be  functional and active.
Our construct with CtfB and double terminator (K1669005) was first ligated as a back insert into their  plasmid pSB1C3 with GFP (BBa_K1655001) .
Restriction of plasmids with CtfB and double terminator as back inserts and plamids with GFP as back vectors. The inserts and vectors were isolated from the gel and ligated.
Colony PCR after ligation of CtfB and double terminator after the GFP. Longer products are succesful.
The fused construct was then ligated as a back insert into a plasmid with a strong promoter and a  strong RBS (BBa_K608002) .
Restriction of plasmids with GFP, CtfB and double terminator as back inserts and plasmid with promoter and RBS as back vector. After they have separated better the insert and vector were isolated from the gel and ligated.
Colony PCR after ligation into a plasmid with promoter and RBS. Longer products are succesful.
We received positive results with colony PCR and anlytical restriction, but no flurescence was  detected under UV light and we were unable to determine the functionality of the fused protein with  SDS-PAGE and Western blot.
SDS-PAGE of the construct containing GFP and CtfB. Gene activity was not confirmed.
Therefore, another experiment was completed.  The BioBrick with GFP was ligated as a back insert into the same vector with strong promoter and a  strong RBS as before.
Restriction of plasmids with GFP as back inserts and plamids with promoter and RBS as back vectors. The inserts and vectors were isolated from the gel and ligated.
Colony PCR after ligation of GFP into the plasmid containing promoter and RBS. Succesful bands are circuled.
An SDS-PAGE was again completed, but no flurescence was observed under UV light.
SDS-PAGE of construct containing GFP. Gene is active as evidend by the bands around 25 kDa.

Human practices
When deciding what our human practices would entail, we faced the dilemma of what issues  concerning the society are most urgent to address and by which criteria they should be chosen. At  the end, we settled on focusing on four main goals: connecting to the professionals, reaching out to  public, engaging the youth, and addressing the ethics of both synthetic biology in general and our  project specifically.
CONNECING TO THE PROFESSIONALS
We decided to present our people to the professionals with experience in research and the industry  of biofuel and waste elimination, as well as to the other teams who are competing in iGEM in 2015.  With this spirit we have written several articles about ourselves, our project and the status of  synthetic biology in our country for the Newsletter of iGEM Amoy University team.  We held a video conference with Aalto Helsinki iGEM team, which is also working on the biofuel  problematic. We discussed our respective approaches to the problem and the mechanism of our  solutions. We also presented the project to researchers at the National Chemistry Institute in Ljubljana.
CONNECTING TO THE PEOPLE IN THE INDUSTRY
Our project concerning turning organic waste into biofuel is one with a great potential for  development and for eventual industrial stage. With that in mind we have realized that we would  have to visit a real life company that already does something similar, so that we can better imagine  the scale and equipment with which our project would eventually work. There are no cleaning plants  using bacteria yet in Slovenia and our project is unique in that respect, so we have decided to visit a  somewhat similar company. We  went to an algae water cleaning plant AlgEn, built within the  European project AlgaeBioGas, which aims to clean the liquid part of the digestate sediment from  nearby gasworks (dealing with processing slaughterhouse waste) to such extent that the water will  be able to flow directly to local communal water distribution system. This is the only outside  installation of this size in Europe.  They explained their work and research to us and showed us around the plant, carefully explaining  the purpose of equipment on each stage of water purification, as well as showing us their control  room and the systems they use to monitor the process.  Having thus far only worked on a much smaller scale in the laboratory we were fascinated to see the  size of the pool the algae grow in and the main computer monitoring and adjusting the parameters,  which helped us imagine how our project could eventually turned out.  We explained our own work and what we hoped to accomplish and were given some pointers by the  experienced researchers who deal with similar projects every day.

REACHING OUT TO GENERAL PUBLIC
Reaching out to general public, we were faced with two greater problems: public ignorance  concerning synthetic biology and the negative attitude about GMOs.  Explaining our project to friends and family, we realized that people are mostly completely unaware  of what synthetic biology even is, let alone anything more specific, which is understandable.  Humanities and social sciences relate closely and noticeably to our everyday life, and are therefore  more integrated into the general education of citizens of Slovenia. Understanding science, however,  especially something as peculiar to the general public as synthetic biology is, often requires very  specific knowledge that is thought at universities but is less easily accessible otherwise. For instance,  the news on national television covers topics such as politics, international relations and culture  every evening, but science is not often mentioned. Besides just the problem of being unaware, this  minimal representation of science also means it is often not founded well, which affects the future of  our nation more than we might realize.  Moreover, people who are more aware of genetic engineering and synthetic biology, often have a  rather unfavorable attitude towards it, mostly focusing on the potentially negative sides of it, but are  usually unaware of the positive sides, such as production of insulin, artemisinin and other drugs that  were made much more affordable and safe precisely by the use of genetic engineering.  For these two reasons we have decided one of our main priorities would be firstly introducing  synthetic biology to society and secondly addressing the public concerns regarding it.
TRADITIONAL MEDIA
We realized that the way to reach the most people would be by traditional media: newspapers,  television, radio and internet platforms. Therefore, we have contacted and invited reporters and  journalists to both our labs, showed them our work and results and talked about our project. More  importantly we talked about the importance of natural sciences and synthetic biology in particular to  the society, especially when dealing with issues like health, nutrition and the environment.  Our efforts proved fruitful, as we have managed to be featured and seen many times.  We had an interview for Radio Študent, where our team member talked about the iGEM competition  and importance of biofuel. You can hear the full recording (in Slovene) here.  We had two interviews for evening news programs, talking about engagement of youth in sciences,  biobutanol and going from idea to a publicly available functioning product in synthetic biology.

There was an article about us in the daily newspaper Dnevnik, as well as the Sunday Nedeljski  Dnevnik, read by approximately 319000 people. We talked about the upcoming Giant Jamboree, our  progress on the project and our motivation for choosing natural science as a career path and  applying to iGEM. You can see the contributions here.  In an effort to connect with as many people as possible, we also published a piece about our work  and techniques of synthetic biology on a popular internet platform Metina lista, which you can see  here.
SOCIAL MEDIA
Traditional media is mostly aimed to audiences between 18 and 60 years of age, but we decided not  to be bound by the limitations of traditional media, and expanded our campaign to social media as  well, which is read mostly by our peers, but more and more by the rest of the public as well.  Most read was our facebook page (iGEM HS Slovenia), where we published weekly updates on our  project and interesting articles about advancements in synthetic biology we found as well as pictures  and anecdotes from the lab.  We also created a twitter account (iGEM HS Slovenia) and a web site for sponsors and other people  interested in the details of our work.
PRESENTING TO POLITICIANS AND LEGISLATORS
While presenting our project to the public is indeed very rewarding, we also found it important to  explain the benefits of synthetic biology to the people who hold the most power in our country, and  are therefore most able to make a difference quickly. We were fortunate enough to be able to  present our project to the highest officials in Slovenia.  Our team representatives attended the 2nd Conference of Young Researchers of Slovenia and  Students from Abroad and Slovenia, the honorary sponsor of which is the president of Slovenia,  Borut Pahor. Slika 3: Attending the conference at the presidential palace We were even prouder to be able to personally present the aim of our research to the prime minister  of Slovenia, Dr. Miro Cerar and to be able to talk to him about the future of science in Slovenia, the  involvement of students in research and about the importance of supporting the inspiring youth for  every country. We were overjoyed to see that the prime minister takes such sincere interest in areas  we are also passionate about and that he understands the importance support for the youth in  science can make. While it is certainly very satisfying to work in a laboratory, such interactions where  you can see what a difference you can make are very rewarding as well. Being able to open  someone's mind, but even more so when is the prime minister's mind, to the important issues of  science and of support for the young scientists is certainly a memorable experience. Slika 4: Presenting to the prime minister
ENGAGING THE YOUTH
As young people with great passion for science we found it very important to engage with other  young people.  Presenting synthetic biology to the young has the advantage that they were usually  not already influenced by the negative connotations the words genetic engineering bring with them  and are thus able to listen to us with open minds. It goes without saying that we found it important,  but also very fulfilling to present our project to our peers and connect with them trough common  interests in science.  (There is more to our efforts in presenting synthetic biology to the young, thought. Worrisome  statistics already show, that the young have become less interested in natural science in the recent  years, instead choosing to focus on social sciences, which provide a broad base for acquisition and  processing of experiences and knowledge in real life. High school students are choosing to take final  exams (Slovenian Matura) in natural sciences less, in favor of more socially engaged disciplines, like  history and psychology. Given our own passion for science we are afraid that the students were not  shown the beauty and usefulness of science.-če bi našla kakšne dejanske podatke, da tole tudi  podprem)   We took the saying Children are our future to the heart and made sure to present our project to  children and teenagers as well as adults. We made sure to not only talk about synthetic biology and  our project, but also why science is so important, what had drawn us to it and our experience with it.
PRESENTATIONS IN HIGH SCHOOLS
We had presentations in many secondary school institutions across the country, talking about our  experience and how exciting our project is to our peers. We mostly presented this to students in 3rd  and 4th year of high school, who are just choosing what subjects they should take their exams in and  what university they should apply to. We were hoping to show them that natural sciences are an  exciting and rewarding career path and to inspire and encourage them to pursue science, if that was  their wish. We were glad to see that the students were indeed interested and engaged with us during  and after presentations, asking us questions about the project, synthetic biology, the iGEM  competition and our experience with research.
Slika 5: Gymnasium Trbovlje gave us their T-shirts as a thanks
Some of the presentations were in Slovene, but some, intended to the students pursuing the  International Baccalaureate, were in English.  We had presentations in the following high schools and secondary educational institutions:  - Bežigrad Grammar School  - Diocesan Classical Gymnasium  - Gymnasium Kranj  - Gymmasium Trbovlje  -Jurij Vega Grammar School  -First Grammar School Celje  -Novo Mesto Grammar School  Slika 6: The high school where we presented iGEM
PRESENTATIONS AT SCIENCE FESTIVALS
We made presentations for the wider public as well. Wanting to interact with youth interested in  science, we arranged to present ourselves and iGEM at science festivals.  We spend a day at a booth at ZOTKA's talents science festival. ZOTKS (Association for Technical  Culture of Slovenia) is a society that organizes a research competition for high school and elementary  school children every year. After submitting their research, the finalists are honored and given their  awards at ZOTKA's talents, where they also present their research. Other societies and people with  interesting research to show are invited as well, and the event attracts many visitors: finalists, other  competitors, their families, important researchers, members of Association for Technical Culture and  politicians. We were glad to be able to present our work and the whole field of synthetic biology to  many aspiring young scientists.
Slika 7: Our presentation at Sciencetival
We decided to present our project to children as well, and were fortunate enough to be able to make  a presentation at another science festival aimed at younger children and their parents. Hiša  eksperimentov (The House of Experiments) is a museum trying to appeal science to kids. The  museum is full of fun experiments (giant bubbles, a bed of nails, dancing non-Newtonian fluid, visual  tricks etc.) that explain the basic concepts of natural sciences (such as surface tension, the  distribution of forces, electricity, friction…) to young children in an entertaining way. The museum  also has exciting curses, such as ''Eggology'', ''Bubblelogy'' and ''Ice creamology'' to interest children  in science. Every year the museum organizes Znanstival (Sciencetival), a festival of sciences for  families with children, where we presented iGEM and our project as well. We found this presentation  particularly challenging, as the children do not understand more technical concepts of synthetic  biology, but we were able to explain it to them by using metaphors like building a world with legos  and cutting and pasting collages.

Ethics & synthetic biology
Synthetic biology strives towards using engineering principles to the practice of biology and  makes the development of biological systems possible, including development of entire  organisms, which don’t exist in nature and serve solely specified human purposes. Synthetic  biology relies on genetic engineering techniques of recombinant DNA that were first  developed in the 1970s, but synthetic biology hopes to bring these techniques many steps  forward. It aims at the development of genetic sequences that can serve as standardized  modules and be used in standardized platform organisms to cause those organisms to  exhibit predictable behaviours.
This rapidly advancing technology raises ethical questions about benefits and harms that  have not been thoroughly addressed and are subject to a worldwide debate. For example,  many countries of the EU are attempting to completely ban the use of GMOs in agriculture  and food, but on the other hand, many other countries such as the USA are growing more  and more genetically modified crops. Synthetic organisms raise questions about public  health, environmental contamination, and even abuse. This technology could be very  dangerous, if it ever falls into the wrong hands, since it could be used for bioterrorism. Other  concerns that have a more religious nature are about the very idea of creating synthetic  organisms. These tap into our instincts about what is natural and what is our relationship to  the natural world, but also about the intrinsic value of human creativity and industry.
But like most things, not even synthetic biology is purely black and white. It also opens door  to numerous practical applications of living organisms, especially bacteria. It could make our  lives easier, safer and better and could even help us to do more to preserve the  environment. Medicine, agriculture, waste treatment, fuel production and pharmaceutics  are just some of the possible are where synthetic biology could mean an enormous  breakthrough and a solution to many of our problems. One possible invention it could bring  is personalized medicine tailored to each individual. These would be more efficient than  normal medicines and would also cause fewer side effects. Also, in most cases these  applications would require GMOs, safely trapped in bioreactors; therefore the fear of these  organisms being released into naturel is redundant.

At the end, both the risks and benefits have to be taken into consideration when deciding on  ethical questions of this kind and the decision should be made simply by determining which prevail.

Our Journey
 
''If you want to go quickly, go alone. If you want to go far, go  together.''
- African proverb -
  The beginning of our journey
 
When we first saw that The National Institute of Chemistry was looking for team members  to present the colours of Slovenia iGEM HS Division, we thought it would be a great  opportunity to do what something we were interested in and learn something new. We  applied to the call for applications and hoped for the best. Parts of the application  procedure were writing a motivational letter, attending an interview, taking part in a  personality test and, the toughest of them all, solve a scientific problem.
 14 months ago, we knew nothing about synthetic biology because we only learned the  basics in our biology and chemistry classes. We had no clue how demanding the project is  going to be at the time.
Building a knowledge basis
 
When we started with our team meetings in September and October 2014,  we first had to  learn the basics of biochemistry and biotechnology.  Through autumn and winter we have  had having lessons two afternoons per week after school. We learned about cloning,  plasmids, PCR and biobricks. Moreover, we learned how to edit wiki pages, use  bioinformatics programs and data bases. At the same time we were also studying the  additional literature and developing our ideas. We learned about E. coli, conditions for its  optimal growth and bioreactors. Finally, we got to enter the labs where we practiced basic  lab techniques and protocols, such as pipetting with micropipettes. We also cut the vectors  with restriction enzymes for the first time and tested our samples using agarose gel  electrophoresis.  It needless to say how fascinated we were when we were actually able to  see several pieces of DNA of different lengths.  It was a great experience because we were tutored by university professors and scientists  who were really able to explain to us everything thoroughly.
So Let’s get to work!
 
Afterwards we decided to divide in two working groups: biotechnologists and synthetic  biologists. Biotechnologists worked under the supervision of The National Institute of  Chemistry while synthetic biologists worked under the supervision of The Faculty of  Chemistry and Chemical Technology. We also held regular team meetings during which we  organized our teamwork and exchanged our results and experience.
   When we first actually started working in the lab we wanted to obtain the genes needed for  building our construct from a mixed culture which we knew also contained Clostridium. We  wanted to do so because The Laboratory for Environmental Sciences and Engineering  already used this culture for their own experiments and we wanted to make use of it as  well. As our DNA purification from mixed culture was unsuccessful we decided to go a step  further and order pure culture and purify the DNA out of it. However, this was also  unsuccessful and we decided to order synthetic DNA segments from IDT Technologies.  These arrived in late June and since then we spent more or less every day in the lab.
  Summer of tears and sweat (and empty AGE gels)
We spent the following months sweating in the lab. Our days consisted of cloning, doing  colony PCRs, testing our samples, hoping for positive results of agarose gel electrophoresis  and crying as this was rarely the case. At the same time we prepared different mediums to  see what best suits for E. coli's growth, measured absorbance, worked in both aerobic and  anaerobic conditions (the following were especially fun), carried out the ecotoxicological  tests, isolated n-butanol, prepared different mediums again and analysed tons of results.
There is life outside the lab too…
 
Besides the lab work we also filmed a short clip about our project and presented our project  and principles of synthetic biology to a wider audience. We met the Slovenian prime  minister while doing so and made sure he understood what we were trying to accomplish. We established our very first crowdfunding campaign on Indiegogo, wrote articles,  collaborated with other iGEM teams, searched for sponsors and designed our wiki.
The lessons we learned
To be honest, we have never imagined how demanding it would be to manage such a  project. In fact, it turned out to be much more than just a scientific research. Being a part of  this project was a great opportunity to experience real-life scientific teamwork, develop  organisational and leadership skills. On the other hand we had to overcome a lot of obstacles, from having troubles with  bureaucracy to not being able to get our vectors into bacteriae. It was then when we  realized only we are the ones responsible for the project and that it is on us to reach out for  help. We learned that in the end you always have to do what you have to do, no matter how  hard it may seem. Perhaps the crucial lesson of this summer was about the importance of  collaboration with others or, to put it another way, to stick together through thick and  thin.

Recipes for testing
•The procedure for bioreactor preparation
2 grams of glucose are added into 500 ml bioreactor. Glucose serves as nutrition for the mixed culture, present in the inoculum. In the beaker, 300 g of inoculum and 100 g of deionized water are weighted for each bioreactor. 12 reactors are prepared simultaneously. Then, pH of the solution in each bioreactor is set on 5.7 with 2 molar hydrogen chloride. When setting the appropriate pH, the solution is mixed with the mixer in order to give a homogenous solution. 400g of the solution is weighted in the bioreactor and purged with nitrogen for 10 minutes without being closed. Set a mechanic mixer with one pipe, leading directly into inoculum, and one for measuring the products in bioreactors. The bioreactors were then purged again, this time with argon for 5 minutes. Argon is used because it ensures anaerobic environment alike nitrogen, and because it does not form compounds with the substances in inoculum. The protocol is the same as above mentioned with some modifications: two bioreactors were ‘blind’ without any added glucose that serves as control bioreactors and 6 bioreactors contained 2 g of glucose per 400 g of solution (inoculum + deionized water). 200 ml of sample with adjusted pH at 5.7 got frozen.
Preparation of samples for HLPC measurements
The syringe is placed on the neck of the plastic tube of bioreactor and then you open the valve of the tube and take the sample (approximately 2 ml). Next, close the valve and transmit the sample into microcentrifuge tubes that had to be marked with the time and date of sampling. The volume of the taken sample is constantly recorded to prevent: lest the removed solution from affecting the final production. Before proceeding on, the plastic tube has to be purged with argon, to prevent inoculum from staying inside the tube and preventing the sampling in advance.  Be careful; use only the amount of argon that corresponds the volume of the plastic tube so no argon is purged in the sample.
Transmit the sample in the microcentrifuge tubes and weigh them.  One microcentrifuge tube with the water, that weights the same as a sampling microcentrifuge tube, must be prepared for centrifugation. In the centrifuge, each microcetrifuge tube has to have the complementary tube that weights the same and it is placed in the hole opposite the hole with the sample in it. Microfuges tubes are centrifuged for 20 minutes at 10 000 rotations per minute with intent to remove solid substances. 0.3 ml of the supernatant is then diluted with 2.7 ml of distilled water and filtrated approximately 1 ml – 1.5 ml into vials.
HPLC measurement (Agilent 1260 Infinity HPLC, Agilent Techologies):
Prepare 2 vials with MQ for equilibration.  All samples must be filtrates and checked if they are suitable for HPLC grade. Conditions for HLPC measurements:
•HI-Plex colon (Agilent Techonologies, 7.7x 300mm, 8 µm)
•DAD detector
•Temperature = 50°C
•0.01 M H2SO4
•Flux: 0.6 ml / min
•Volume: 20 µl
Analysis of butyric acid occurred on DAD detector at 210 nm.
Preparation of standard ENDO medium: For 100 ml of ENDO medium (BUJON) with lactose and antibiotic:
•1,00 g of meat peptone
•1,00 g of lactose
•0,25 g of sodium sulfite
•0,35 g of dipotassium hydrogen phosphate
Preparation of peptone water (250 ml): •1,50 g of peptone
•1,75 g of sodium chloride
Add MQ to the mark labelling 250 ml.
The chemical composition of 72 different media
SLIKA TABELE GOJIŠČ!!!!!!!!!!
Instructions for media preparation
At the begging, prepare yourself a solution of HCl and solution of NaOH in the beaker, which serve you as the pH regulators. Prepare the beaker with distilled water for deposition of pH electrode.
For HCl solution, prepare 20 ml of strong HCl and dilute it in 100 ml of distilled water. For NaOH solution, prepare 40 g of NaOH and dilute it in 200 ml of distilled water. Use glasses and be careful; solution can boil!
Media G1-G4 prepare according to the upper table in the Falcon cetrifugate tubes.
Butyric acid is measured with pipette:
•0,12 g = 126 µL
•0,080 g = 84 µL
•0,040 g = 42 µL
Glycerol, lactose, NaCl and yeast extract are weighed.
Other media prepare in the 2000 ml flask (which is put on the balance and place TARE in advance) following chemicals:
•20 g of meat peptone
•7 g of dipotassium hydrogen phosphate
•5 g of sodium sulfite
All chemicals are weighted with analytic balance in the weighing boats, which must not be wet during the weighting. Add a few milliliters of MQ to dissolve the chemicals and then fill the flask to the begging of narrow neck.  First prepare the flask with pH=5, then repeat the procedure for pH = 6, pH=7, pH=8.
Media G5-G68 are prepared following these instructions:
•Put the beaker with the empty Falcon centrifuge tube on the balance and press TARE
•Weigh 35 g of solution from the flask and pour the chemicals in it. Always wash the weighing boats with water and pour the water in the Falcon centrifuge tube
•Add the media from the flask up to 39 g and regulate the pH value with appropriate NaOH or HCl solution
•Place the tube on the Vortex machine for 20 seconds
•Check the pH value again and if it is not suitable, regulate it again!
•Fill the Falcon centrifugate tube up to 40,00 g and close it.
Inoculation of genetically modified E.coli:
Bacteria were inoculated on the new LB plate in laminar:
•One colony is taken from the previous plate with inoculation loop
•Gently draw a new plate with inoculation loop (6-times left and right, one down and another left to right)
•Wrap the LB plate with the parafilm
•Date and name of the bacteria were written on each sample and medium were put in the incubator set on 37°C.
Instructions for an autoclave:
Autoclave is filled with laboratory equipment for disengagement, closed with the lid and the lid is tighten with screws. The level of water is checked; if not in the blue area, you open the valve and add distilled water through the funnel and close the valve. Then, close the steam conduit and turn on the autoclave with the switch on the wall so that the red light lits. When the pressure reaches the value of 1 bar, the green light turns on and the autoclaving begins. Gently open the steam conduit. After the autoclaving is over, the autoclave must be turn off, the filtration of air is turned on and the steam conduit is completely opened. Wait until the autoclave is completely cooled down to open the lid.
Preparation of physiological solution (500ml 0,9 % NaCl )
4,5 g NaCl is diluted in 500 ml of water in the flask and transmitted in the laboratory bottle with blue lid, which must be howled only twice for the autoclave.
The sterilization of antibiotic
Engulf antibiotic with the injection from microcentrifugate tube, place the sterile filter on it and pour antibiotic in the new microcentrifugate tube. Mark the tube with appropriate signification.
Biosafety cabinet
First you have to turn on the cabinet, set the eager conditions and then disinfect it at least 10 minutes before you are starting to work. The work must run from the sterile to the infected side and never opposite! When you finish, disinfect all objects before you remove them from the biosafety cabinet. Turn off the biosafety cabinet.
The analysis of the waste glycerol
•CHNS analysis
•Karl-Fitcher titration
The sample is diluted with water by the factor 100 and filtered through the filter into a vial. Then, standard HPLC analysis is done.

The preparation of biofilm Escherichia coli
Our team prepared 100 ml of ENDO medium (BUJON) with lactose and antibiotic:
·         1,00 g of meat peptone
·         1,00 g of lactose
·         0,25 g of sodium sulfite
·         0,35 g of dipotassium hydrogen phosphate
We also prepared 250 ml of peptone water:
·         1,50 g of peptone
·         1,75 g of sodium chloride
Add MQ up to the labelled mark in both solutions. Both media are placed in the autoclave simultaneously with the holders for 50ml biofilm. When all items are sterilized, they are placed directly in the laminar. At the moment when the temperature of the both media is 60°C the antibiotic was added (1 µl on every 1ml of medium), which is previously filtered through the sterilized filter (0,2 µm pore). After the ENDO medium reaches a room temperature, the bacteria, growing on the LBC medium in the incubator on 37°C, are inoculated.  Then, the conical flask is put on the shaker (100 rmp)  for 12 hours at 37°C and is used for the transmission of the medium into sterilized 26-well plate the next day. In each well was added with 100 µl of diluted solution of bacteria in peptone water, diluted in the ratio 1:100. The sample was incubated for 3 days at 37°C without shaking the well plate.

About us
About the first Slovenian high school iGEM team
We are a high school research group composed of 8 biology and chemistry  enthusiasts. As we attend 7 different secondary educational institutions across all  Slovenia we are a very diverse team. We are all honoured to be the first Slovenian  high school team to take part in the iGEM HS competition and face the challenges  the synthetic biology poses.
''Alone we can do so little; together we can do so much''
- Helen Keller -
We joined our knowledge and experience under the supervision of the National  Institute of Chemistry Slovenia and the Chair of Biochemistry of the Faculty of  Chemistry and Chemical Technology of the University Ljubljana, who also selected  the team members among 32 applicants. For the application procedure we had to  write a personal statement about our passion for this area of research, attend an  interview and work out a thorough project design challenge.  As we are still only high school students with very little experience in synthetic  biology we could not start working on our project straight away (even though we  wanted to). Instead, we had to sit a few lessons first.  Throughout these we extended our knowledge on our field of work by learning the  basics of biotechnology, synthetic biology, lab safety and by practicing basic lab  protocols.
We carried out their wet-lab research at the Faculty of Chemistry  and Chemical Technology while the biotechnologists preformed their research at the  National Institute of Chemistry. At the same tame we held all-group meetings to  share our results and experience and work on our project thoroughly.

Why are you interested in synthetic biology?
My interest in synthetic biology is based on the variety of different applications it has and the  mechanisms it exploits to achieve these innovations. It uses the fundamental nature`s principles in order to  improve the quality of our lives or to help us preserve the environment.
What was your favorite part of the project?
My favourite part of the project was when we were testing protein expression and for the first time  gained proof our genes in fact work.

Why are you interested in synthetic biology?
I am interested in synthetic biology because of the promising improvements and facilitation of daily life situations. In synthetic biology there is still so much unknown and undiscovered and I wish to narrow that gap. The favorite part of our project was learning about genetic modification and when the first electrophoresis was done. It fascinates me that we can basically modify them in almost any way imaginable, change and cut DNA sequences. I found great passion, happiness and inspiration in chemistry and biology and synthetic biology partially combines both of the above mentioned sciences. But the crucial and the key thing is that besides all the research we do, we widen our knowledge and our horizons, search for new, alternative, better and more effective solutions for the problems, which pest the society nowadays.

Synthetic biology really offers countless opportunities for creating new, important  solutions.There was dramatic development of synthetic biology in last few years and therefore I can  not imagine how much can synthetic biology still give to us to improve our lives in the next years. It  is quite amazing how we can, by using synthetic biologic methods, create extensive  biologic  systems.
What was your favorite part of the project?
Our work was focused on genetic modification of  bacteria. I spent most of time in laboratory working with microorganisms. I enjoyed working with  bacteria, which are really very unpredictable. You simply can’t imagine how many factors have to be  satisfied for successful results. That is really the “mistery” of science work and it makes it attractive.
Responsibilities: lab work, searching for sponsors, tracking synthetic biology protocols, reaching out to public

Why are you interested in synthetic biology?
Synthetic biology brings basic science to a whole new - applicative level. It's a field of science that,  one one hand, opens up a new perspective on the world, and on the other, serves as a source for solutions to   global problems of the modern world. The thing that sparks my interest the most with synthetic biology is, that it ranges in all aspects  of life; from health to environment.
What was your favorite part of the project?
Maybe it sounds cliché, but what I was truly charmed by, in science and research, is that you  never know what is going to happen with your experiment if you change a parameter and what the  output is going to be. Bacteria are living creatures that act completely different from, for instance,  anorganic compounds, which are very predictable. It's the intricacy of living organisms that makes  research truly interesting and exciting!
Responsibilities: lab work, graphical design, wiki design, project clip, poster, tracking protocols

Why are you interested in synthetic biology?
Ever since I was a small child I’ve been intrigued by the nature around me. That’s why I was more than happy when I was told that I'll be part of this story. This was great opportunity for me to work in more than well equipped, gain new knowledges, experiences and friendships. I didn't know that synthetic biology can be so interesting and appealing.
What was your favorite part of the project?
My favorite part of the project was meeting new people and facing chalanges on daily level.

Mariša Cvitanič
Bežigrad Grammar School
Why are you interested in synthetic biology?
Synthetic biology absolutely fascinates me because there is so much that could be done  using its methods! I think the whole field of synthetic biology is unbelievably promising: from  applications in medicine, pharmacy, to industry and even fuel production. Every time I think of what  else could be created my imagination blooms with ideas and this is what really makes me feel  inspired and motivates me.
What was your favorite part of the project?
I would say the best part of our project was the fact that we were given the opportunity to  work under the surveillance of such amazing mentors. I enjoyed every single day in the lab  community for I am an inquirer and there was always something new to learn.
Responsibilities: lab work, photography, wiki design, reaching out to public, collaboration with other teams, planning, social media, fundraising campaign, project clip
Aleš Zupančič
Novo mesto Grammar School
Why are you interested in synthetic biology?
If I had been asked about synthetic biology at the beginning of my high school career, I would have  probably tried to overcome the »words failed me« moment and do absolutely everything to hide the  fact that I don't have a single clue about it. Through years, I have come across this new, modern, and  vital science that showed me that rather than learn about biological concepts on their own trying to  apply them to a bunch of random unrealistic problems; it came like an unexpected solution that can  be directly applied to ""real life"" problems and situations.
What was your favorite part of the project?
Working in laboratory, I have soon realized that the key for successful research is combining various  sciences and knowledge of scientists from several areas of expertise to create a  multidisciplinary research. Although our project is primary focused on synthetic biology, it  combines elements from chemistry, ecology, and chemical engineering. Only when combined  together, they can form a project that can offer a possible solution to one of the future  world's most important problems.
Responsibilities: planning, lab work
Nina Jerala
Diocesan Classical Gymnasium
Why are you interested in synthetic biology?
Because by taking parts of many different natural biological systems and standardising them, we can  make complicated processes relatively simple and efficient in solving many of the world's problems,  such as disease, pollution, and energetics.  Furthermore, it is a novel approach to learning about and understanding the natural world around  us, and what is cooler than that?
What was your favorite part of the project?
For me the absolute favorite part is the rush after looking at your results and realizing  they were  finally succesful and that the biological systems you designed are working like you want them to.  There is nothing else like it.

Abstract
Did you know that between 1850s and today we have spent as much as 135 billion tons of oil and our  demands are only increasing? Oil is of tremendous importance in our everyday life, but it is difficult  to obtain and multinationals that assume the risks and responsibilities associated with that also gain  the ability to monopolize it, making it unequally accessible.  More importantly, oil is a non renewable source and some projections say we only have enough for  the next 40 years! But we use it in connection to  transportation, energy, pharmacy, artificial  materials and it has many, many other implications. Life as we know it today is simply not possible  without it. So what can we do? It is necessary to find an ecologically friendly, self sustainable and  globally accessible alternative for obtaining fuels.  Here is where our idea comes in! Because of its chemical structure, butanol is very similar to  conventional fuels and a perfect replacement for them, as it can be used in eternal combustion  engines without modifying them. But how can we get biobutanol? Turns out we can produce it from  organic waste! In anaerobic conditions we can transform organic waste to biogas (to be used as  energy source on its own) and butanoic acid. We can then take the butanoic acid and transform it  into biobutanol with the help of microorganisms. The method is completely safe to people and to the  environment and the microorganisms are contained and carefully controlled. And thus instead of  polluting the Earth we have produced a useful, easy and accessible method of obtaining biofuel from  garbage!

From the very beginning we knew that the participation at the iGEM HS competition would be very  expensive. There were a lot of costs increasing during our work. Lab supplies like chemicals, enzymes  and oligonucleotides cost a lot of money. There were also team registration fees for the competition  and the Giant Jamboree as well as travel and accommodation costs in Boston.
For all this, it was neccessary to gather a lot of funds. For us high school students it was not an easy task.  We had to find a lot of sponsors and donators. We tried to collect as much money as we could,  gradually. First we focused on sponsor contracts. We made a list of the most successful companies in  Slovenia and then the contracts were sent to them. We focused also on municipalities from Slovenia.  We were also logged on a national tender for financing research and scientific work.
On the other hand, we were searching also alternative ways of financing our project. In this respect, we  have made a crowdfunding campaign on Indiegogo. We can conclude that this campaign was successful.
On this occasion, we would like to thank again all our sponsors and donators for their kind support. Big  thank is also going to our mentors at the National Institute of Chemistry (NIC), Slovenia, and at the Chair  of Biochemistry, Faculty of Chemistry and Chemical Technology (FCCT), University of Ljubljana.  The two graphs below show the structure of financing our project.

Safety
When working in any laboratory, even if it is only your school`s chemistry lab, safety should  undoubtedly be your main concern.  Work safety includes everything from proper  equipment such as protective gloves, glasses, lab coat etc., to adequate preparations and  proper disposal of chemicals and organisms.
Our experience with lab safety
Prior to this project we had already worked in a laboratory, either at school, in a research  facility or in some other way. This way we had acquired a lot of experience in this field and  were fully aware the importance of lab safety. It is a responsibility you have towards yourself  and others working with you.
That is why before even stepping into a laboratory we had a mandatory work and laboratory  safety lecture at the National Institute of Chemistry. We revised and upgraded our previous  knowledge on this topic and after passing the exam we were fully prepared and educated on  the topic of safe laboratory work. Prof. dr. Marko Dolinar, a member of the Slovene Scientific  committee for work with GMOs in contained use, gave us a lecture on genetically modified  organism and concerns regarding their use and safety. Additionally, we also watched two  educational videos, which were provided to us by iGEM and gave us further information on  how to work with living microorganism and how to handle GMOs.
Chemicals
We mostly dealt with chemicals which are in general safe, for example agarose and peptone,  but in case of chemicals such as butyric acid, hydrochloric acid, sodium hydroxide and  ethidium bromide, special caution was required. When handling with ethidium bromide,  which is considered mutagen, carcinogen and teratogen, we were especially careful. We  consistently used the stronger (purple) nitrile gloves and were cautious not to touch  unnecessary objects when using them to prevent contamination of surfaces and equipment  with ethidium bromide and maintain the required level of safety. In any case, ethidium  bromide can only be used in the so-called 'electrophoresis lab'. No equipement or  consumables used for work with ethidium bromide is allowed to leave this lab (except for  waste sealed in a bag).
Organisms
We worked in a Level 1 laboratory, because all the organism (Escherichia coli and Clostridium  acetobutylicum) and parts we were using fall into this biosafety category. Both bacteria are  safe to use since they pose a minimal potential threat to people in the laboratory and do not  consistently cause disease in healthy adults. Nevertheless, we were precautious and used  proper disinfectant to clean the laminar flow cabinet and other working areas as some of the  E. coli we were using during our research was of course genetically modified.  Working in a dedicated molecular biology lab our working space is separate from the rest of  the facility. Our lab is a part of a department which again is separated from the rest of the  building by a door that locks automatically, so that the access to the department is  controlled. Work was preformed on an open lab table. Personal protective gear (lab coat and  gloves) was worn at all times and was supplemented with eye and ear protection as needed  (for example for work with UV light or sonication).  All liquid waste was autoclaved before  being discharged. Solid waste was collected separately and disposed by inicineration by an  independent  contractor. A sink for hand washing and 70% ethanol was available for  sterilisation at all times if needed.
Butanol
Butanol as our main product, when produced in adequate quantities, would be used in  standard Otto gasoline engines as a propellant. Since this engine is one of two most common  engines, the other one being the diesel engine, we had to consider several aspects of  butanol`s broad use, including safety and possible impact it would have on the environment.
Butanol is according to the CDC harmful to health.  It causes  damage if inhaled, ingested or if it comes in contact with skin or eyes. Inhalation of vapours  may cause headache, nausea, drowsiness and dizziness and irritation of the respiratory tract.  Ingestion may result in vomiting, nausea, diarrhoea, abdominal pain, dizziness and  drowsiness. Exposure to the eyes and skin causes irritation, redness and pain.
1-Butanol has low water solubility, is biodegradable and therefore not expected to  significantly accumulate in nature. In open spaces, at normal temperature, 1-butanol  decomposes due to photolysis. It is a combustible and flammable liquid, sensible to static  discharges. Flash point of butanol is 29°C so spontaneous ignition is possible on hot days.
But compared to gasoline butanol is much safer to use. Gasoline is more hazardous to health  as butanol, because in addition to skin, eye and respiratory irritation, dizziness and  drowsiness, it is also mutagenic, carcinogenic and toxic to reproduction, causes damage to  organs (liver, kidneys, bladder, blood, bone marrow, nervous system) through prolonged or  repeated exposure and may be fatal if swallowed or inhaled. Gasoline`s flash point is -43°C  and as such significantly lower than the flash point of butanol. In addition gasoline poses a  greater threat to the environment than butanol, because it is poisonous to aquatic life. Gasoline safety sheet
To conclude, common use of butanol as a propellant may require certain safety precautions  during production, transportation and storage. Possible dangers of its use could be  eliminated with the same preventive measures that are already implemented for other  flammable liquid car fuels.
Butyric acid
Butyric acid is a medium-strong carboxylic acid. Because it is the first and most important  substrate of our engineered metabolic path, its dangers should be taken into consideration  before any large-scale production of butanol is established. Butyric acid is corrosive and can  cause pain, redness and severe deep burns on skin and loss of vision. If ingested, it can cause  abdominal pain, shock or collapse. Inhalation may result in sore throat, cough, burning  sensation, shortness of breath and laboured breathing. Butyric acid safety sheet It is  also combustible and forms explosive vapours above 72°C. With proper action these dangers  should be eliminated.

There were 4 main stages of development of our project:
Brainstorming – It all started with the introduction to the basic genetics terminology and an introduction to the laboratory procedures. Then, there came the ideation and brainstorming, which covered a variety – from toxic substance detection to mould prevention – and finally, to the self-sustainable mosquito trap. This was the part we all contributed to with our ideas, which were developed over time in more detail. The final idea was the product of a completely different idea, but was right away recognized as the one which would get us to the stage of…
Bio-development – after we gathered the data about the bio-components, the whole team moved to the lab. The main contributors, however, were Dhanya Baby, Shien Yang Lee and Tina Kim, especially when it comes to the part design and assembling. They were backed by Quan Vuong, who was elsewhere in charge of the administration procedures of ordering and keeping track of the parts in general. Since we had little marginal benefit from the rest of the team, which consisted mostly of engineers, that part moved to…
Trap prototyping – From the beginning, it was clear we had a general idea of how we see our end product. The limitation of the resources we posed to ourselves gave us a lot of troubles and prompted us to be as creative as possible. This challenge was undertaken by Jovan Jovancevic, Krishna Gaire and Sahan Tampoe.
Documentation-Both stages succeeded to their best abilities in the given time and it was time to organize the documentation. Here it showed particularly useful to have Muhammad Shujaat Mirza, who made the wiki page and enabled the world to see our work.
We would like to thank the following people for supporting us during this project in their respective domains:
Dr Kourosh Salehi-Ashtiani, for kind and patient mentorship and expertise –  most of all – for believing in the pioneering work we have done for iGEM at the University
Joseph Koussa, for bearing with us through both brainstorming and in the lab; not only for answering our 2 am concerns and for relentless criticism, but also for great support. Through his “guided democracy,” he made us stand up for our ideas and show great critical thinking in order to, finally, arrive at the best project idea
Kenan Jijakli, for shedding the holy engineering light onto our discussions, for guiding us through both the basics of genetics and the lab experience and for understanding the different perspectives we had; coming from different backgrounds, and adapting to them accordingly.
Matthew Karau, for the help on the device making side –  as a leading engineer in charge of the SuperLab, arguably the only fully equipped lab in the world where we could have worked day and night to materialize our idea. Also, we are grateful for the help in thinking about the possibilities, once our device would leave the lab and enter the real world.
Dr Michael Davis, for the help on improving upon our electric mesh and 3D metal printing a new version, for further product development
Farhana Goha, from NYUAD Undergraduate Research office, for enabling the funding for our Summer Research at the University.
David Scicchitano and Eve Johnston from the Science Department of NYUAD, who provided us with the major funding for the Jamboree and making our travel to Boston possible
Renee Dugan, for supporting this project from the administrative side and for approving the partial funding
Kyle Farley, who approved and recommended our project for Advancement Opportunities program, which provided partial funding for the Jamboree.
Julie Brookes , for supporting us from the administrative side while applying for funding.
Maria Vogel , for her help in designing the logo.

About the Team
We are a committed group of students who love to do science. We are comprised of students from different majors: biotechnology engineering, design, and computer technology. We also are from across the country, reunited in the same school. We interact         and enrich each other’s ideas as we contrast our points of views.
We all started as a group of strangers that during the course of the project ended up as best friends, trusting and knowing each other. We first discovered in each other the interest in synthetic biology, and ended up as more than colleagues. The         team was what it was thanks to our various abilities and different personalities. And that is what created this year’s project, the introduction of an insect cell platform to the competition.

Constant Bourdeloux
Second year student at ESPCI ParisTech graduate engineering school of physics, chemistry and biology. I've done a prep class in mathematics, physics, chemistry and technology in Paris. I am involved in different projects but IGEM is my first biology contest. I usually work on non-destructive testing or with ion-propelled aircraft but I've pretended to be a biologist during this summer! Just joking, I've designed the cells population evolution model.

Ewen Corre
Currently in the program “Interdisciplinary Approaches in Life Sciences” (AIV) I enjoy learning new stuff, especially related to life sciences. I joined the team because of the incredible things we can achieve thanks to synthetic biology. But also because all the other things a team involves: organization, communication, design, parties and fun!

Célia Foulon
I’m 21 and currently a 2nd year student at AgroParisTech. I found out about iGEM haphazardly, but since I love science (especially biology) and I’m always seeking for new adventures, I’ve decided to join the team. I’m learning a lot thanks to all the amazing (and crazy) people I’ve met during this experience. By the end of september, I should be an expert at micropipetting!
Favorite quote: There are no problems, only solutions.
Prateek Garg
I'm a Masters student with a background in Physics, Chemistry, Computational Sciences (little biology), but have learnt a lot of Biology during my work for iGEM. What attracts me to iGEM is the design and the human practices, which is so different from the ""boring"" (haha) normal lab science. I basically managed all the different projects in the team, and was also involved deeply in the design thinking, human practices, mathematical modeling and conceptualizing ideas, and loved it all. But the hectic summer took me off my love of sports, and I'm not complaining a lot. It was worth it :)

Sophie Gontier
I’m a student in both philosophy of science and biology, and I fell in love with synthetic biology two years ago. I discovered the iGEM competition last year when I joined the Evry team, and I enjoyed it so much I wanted to participate again. This year, as part of the Paris Bettencourt team, I spent way more time in the lab and was able to learn so many things, this experience was once again invaluable!

Abdou Hadjadj
I am a student in bioengineering that loves biology and especially physiology. I did two years in med school that really made me discover biology and made me love it along with the different life sciences. I joined iGEM this year thanks to a rouya of mine that heard about it and told me it could be interesting experience (sadly, he couldn't participate). In theteam, I was part of the Human practice and I tried to collect as much information about the acceptance of our project. Besides like to read fantasy and scientific books, I like to watch movies and I play a lot of video games.

Arthur Molkhar
I’ve been in love with genetics for a while now, what I appreciate in synthetic biology is that it  gives us the power to be creative, and this is now so simple to be a part of it, as tools are really simplified. I look forward to see how synbio is going to be huge and more opened to the public. When I’m not tinkering bacteria with the Bettencourt team I’m studying Pharmacie, 5th year now. I also swim a lot in those microbe nest that are parisians swimming pools. I also love being in the woods, take a breath.

Because a summer without discovering anything is a dull summer, I took part in this crazy project. Aside from doing science I like to spend my time playing music, tinkering, reading comic books and cooking stuff. By the way, I am a 6th year pharmacy student doing a biophysics master at École Polytechnique.

Ihab Boulas
After graduating with a Biomedical Sciences BSc., my interests were focused on bringing new answers to neurodegeneration and aging by the use of innovative approaches such as Synthetic Biology. In that respect I wanted to learn by doing Synthetic Biology. Besides, I see this project as a large proof of concept : showing that we are able to control our microbiome. I am a project driven scientist. Being involved in a motivating project allows me to have full commitment to it and to live by it. Thus, I see this competition as an opportunity not only to commit to a project I helped design but also to broaden my skills and show what I can accomplish in a given period of time.
Jake Wintermute
I’m a postdoc at the CRI and I teach the Synthetic Biology course for first-year master’s students. I did my Ph.D. in Pam Silver’s lab in the Harvard Systems Biology department. My research interests include aging, evolution, metabolism and of course Synthetic Biology.

OUR TEAM
Ayesha Bajwa
Ayesha is a rising sophomore majoring in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, although she finds practically every discipline at MIT interesting. From iGEM, she hopes to gain wet lab experience of substance and a context in which to think about the endless possibilities of synthetic biology. She is particularly excited about the intersection of synthetic biology, computer science, and neuroscience. Beyond academics, Ayesha enjoys singing, photographing, being outdoors, and perusing Wikipedia.
Nicholas Brancazio
Nick is a rising junior in the Biology department at UMass Amherst. At school, he works with electroconductive bacteria called Geobacter for biosensing applications. He is excited to be living in Cambridge and working at MIT over the summer, especially for synthetic biology. Nick hopes to develop new methods of metabolic wiring between multiple bacteria to create a highly integrated consortium with unique intercellular properties. He is currently working on achieving the world record for the tastiest stir-fry containing the most ingredients, and is also a shoe-in for the most likely to drop a beat while working in lab.
Molly Brennan
Molly Brennan is a rising sophomore at MIT majoring in Chemical-Biological Engineering or Biological Engineering.  She became interested in synthetic biology after learning about the field through Lemelson-MIT in high school.  iGEM seemed like the perfect way to begin contributing to the field of synthetic biology. She hopes that this project will reduce reliance on nonrenewable resources, such as those composed of methane.  In the future, she hopes to further explore the medical applications of biological engineering and synthetic biology. In her free time, she enjoys dancing in MIT's DanceTroupe and sailing.
Marjorie Buss
Marjorie Buss is a rising sophomore at MIT majoring in Chemical-Biological Engineering and minoring in Math. She is very excited about iGEM’s project this year because of its potential to contribute to alternative energy technology. She is also excited to learn about modeling metabolic systems and about synthetic biology, and to gain wet lab experience. Her previous experiences include working in a chemical engineering lab at MIT during her freshman year, and interning in a thermal coatings and contamination engineering lab at NASA Goddard last summer. Outside of iGEM, Marjorie is a member of MIT’s lightweight rowing team, and holds leadership positions in MIT’s energy club in Alpha Epsilon Phi sorority. She also enjoys running, playing tennis, reading, and being texted random things.
Ryan Chung
Ryan Chung is a rising Sophomore in Computational Biology at MIT. He is excited to work with the iGEM team as there are many opportunities to learn the cutting edge techniques associated with synthetic biology and hopes to apply some of his previous Computer Science knowledge for the project. He is interested in this project in particular because of the interesting applications of biofuels. In his free time he enjoys going out, staying in, chasing Canadian Geese and beatboxing battles in lab.
Alyssa Dayan
Alyssa is a freshman studying Mathematics, Computer Science and Physics (she doesn't really know what she's doing with her life). She had minimal biology experience in high school but has been excited about synthetic biology ever since she was given a tour around a biohack-space in London and learnt about the possibilities for ""hacking"" real living organisms, such as growing human chins on the backs of mice or maybe even mouse chins on the backs of humans. She is looking forward to applying mathematical computery techniques to the project and maybe picking up a few squishy lab skills too. Outside of iGEM Alyssa enjoys bobbing her head to electronic music and scavenging for free food.
Jesse Gibson
Jesse Gibson is a rising sophomore in course 6-7: computer science and molecular biology. He became interested in engineering after participating on his high school robotics team and decided to explore synthetic biology as an interesting application of engineering to complex, micro-scale systems.  He is particularly interested in the intersection of technology and biology as well as the design of genetic circuitry to emulate logical input-output systems.  In his free time, he enjoys reading, biking, and playing Super Smash Bros. (Melee, of course).
Wendi Guraziu
Wendi Guraziu is a rising sophomore in the Biology department at MIT. She got hooked on bio in high school and learned about iGEM and synthetic biology in her high school bio and biotechnology classes. She is very excited about the potential of synthetic biology to improve quality and efficiency for the huge number of possible applications in both home and industrial settings. Wendi loves to travel and go on long walks, try tasty foods from every country Italy to Iraq, cheer on her Chicago Blackhawks, and dance like nobody's watching even when everybody's watching. Outside of iGEM, she is involved in Society of Women Engineers and her sorority, Alpha Chi Omega.
Nathan Hunt
Nathan is a junior at MIT studying molecular biology and computer science. He came to MIT to study biology and is often asked how the two fields of his major work together. There are all sorts of great reasons to study biology and computer science, but he really just added it to his major for fun (he’s a believer that one ought to enjoy life, even work). He finds great joy in creating, whether it’s building a complex program up from simple keywords or an interesting biological system. His interest in these two fields led him to be captured by iGEM’s clever poster about programming life. Despite being interested in learning very many things, he’s focusing on biology because he hopes to use his biology and computer and any other sort of knowledge to heal people. On top of MIT and research, Nathan is very involved in his church; he served a two year church mission in Germany and would love it if you would speak German with him. He also enjoys sailing, hiking, learning everything, and wishes he knew robotics.
Ashti Shah
Ashti Shah is a junior at the Advanced Math and Science Academy Charter School in Marlborough, MA. She is intrigued by the combinatorial possibilities of synthetic biology. She aspires to pursue a career in medicine. Being the foodie she is, you will most probably find her sampling the best places to eat during her lunch breaks.

In his free time, he's a jazz violinist, freelance photographer and graphic designer, and often finds himself matching with the upholstery of his immediate surroundings.
ADVISORS
Lyla Atta
Lyla Atta is a rising junior in Biological Engineering. She is very interested in cellular biology and biochemistry, and especially interested in applications of these areas to neurobiology. At some point in the far (or near?) future she wishes to find science-based answers to questions that were previously thought to be philosophical: what is thinking, understanding and learning? How do all these processes occur in systems that are made up of mere chemicals. Lyla was part of the 2014 MIT iGEM team. It was the first time she had the opportunity to get some laboratory experience (which she was in dire need of, having never worked in a lab before). She is now working with some of her fellow 2014 iGEM team members on a spin-off project while mentoring this year's iGEM. Outside science-related things, Lyla is very interested in education policy and enjoys outdoor activities.
Kathryn Brink
Kathryn Brink is a rising junior at MIT majoring in Biological Engineering. She is excited to be participating in this year’s iGEM competition since she thinks that synthetic biology is a really interesting field with a lot of great applications to medicine, agriculture, and the environment. Kathryn was first introduced to Synthetic Biology through a project-based class where, as part of a team, she designed a genetic circuit to regulate iron absorption in the small intestine, with the goal of helping patients with iron-deficiency anemia. Kathryn was previously an undergraduate researcher in the Ploegh Lab at Whitehead Institute, studying the effects of nanobodies on the activity of glycolytic enzymes from S. cerevisiae. Outside of iGEM, Kathryn is treasurer of Stop Our Silence (a student group concerned with sexual assault awareness), mentors high school girls in science and engineering through the Society of Women Engineers, and is a member of Alpha Chi Omega sorority.
Erik Ersland
Erik Ersland is a Junior majoring in Biological Engineering. Erik is participating in iGEM because it offers a good opportunity to contribute useful work to the scientific and engineering community and because it provides training and perspective that will help him continue to contribute in the future. Previous experience includes two summers interning at Clearwater Analytics as a software developer and numerous garage based projects. He is interested in research that will improve human quality of life, namely technologies with applications in regenerative medicine. Hobbies outside of iGEM include learning about new things, cooking (often for groups), sewing (things like plushies), and mechanical projects.
Eugene Lim
Eugene Lim is a postdoctoral associate in Mechanical Engineering at MIT.  He works in the Soft Active Materials Laboratory led by Professor Xuanhe Zhao.  He is excited to interact with the MIT iGEM community while learning the nuts and bolts of synthetic biology.

About  the Team
As the first modern university in China, Tianjin University has a history of 120 years. However, our School of Life Sciences is very young and fresh, which was founded in 2012. Though our college is so young, we have made many achievements owing to the great supports given by our university and the hard work of our professors and graduates.
This year is the first year when our school took part in the iGEM competition. The recruitment included all undergraduates in our university. After resume screening, audition and a tough winter vacation work which required candidates to submit a complete project design with protocols, 22 students were chosen as the members of team Tianjin 2015.
Our team consists of students majoring in life sciences, chemical/pharmaceutical/biological engineering, computer science, and even electric engineering. In particular, Yifan Zhang in computer science is from Zhejiang Sci-tech University. We are divided into four groups which are responsible for wet lab, wiki&design, modeling and human practice.
In our iGEM journey, our instructors always give us great help, and many graduates shared their experience with us. Since all of us are green hands in biological research, a small step for our project could be a gaint leap for ourselves. No matter what the result is, we have spent a happy and fulfilling time all together.
It is the second time for Ketong to take part in iGEM. And this year not many people would play jokes on him because he has become the team leader and usually shows his straight face. He doesn't like pretty loli anymore, but he still loves female.
Dongqi is another leader in our team. She is lazy in body but hardworking in mind. Larry in the book The Razor's Edge is her idol.
Jiashu is a gentle nice girl, and everyone is impressed with her warm smile. Meanwhile, she is often called Boss by Junjie Yu because she could conduct biological experiments perfectly.
Yang is a junior student majoring in Biology. He would show great earnest and passion when he is doing experiments. And he could do management very well.
When Chenmao joined our team, he was just a freshman, but he had got unique insights about GMO. Although his major is EE, he is no worse than us in doing biological research. Science fiction is always his dish.
Heng is an enthusiastic boy who comes from a beautiful coastal city. His favorite sport is badminton, and our instructor Yang often plays it with him. He believes life is movement.
Junjie Zong is a humorous and lively boy, crazy about sports and Japanese comics. He says he has an inexplicable crush on biological lab…(Do you?)
Yuwei has a very active and open characteristic, sometimes like a boy. However, when she does experiments, she could show great patience and  carefulness. She loves others' praise, so everybody follow me and speak aloud- You are the apple of my eye.
Xuan is the only person praised by Shoujie as handsome. He is very keen on basketball and almost his every WeChat' moment is about it. In our team, he is Ketong's good partner in molecular cloning.
Yuchen describes himself as a talker, however, in our mind he is a singer, though I never get a chance to appreciate his singing. He is in charge of molecular cloning, at the same time he studies English hard every day.  2
Bowen is a graceful girl who is admired by us for her fluent and native English. In her spare time, she loves watching movies and reading books. Christopher Nolan and Scientific American are her favorites.
Junjie Yu is a junior student majoring in Chemical Engineering. He said why he joined us was that Ketong let him consider biological experiments interesting. Now he is in charge of the project of plastic degradation and could do molecular cloning very well.
Haofeng would love to talk with people, creating fun of  dreary experiments. He loves racing with others on agarose gel electrophoresis experiments. In daily life, his hobby is basketball.
Jinxin once said his life was forever about  losing something, looking for it and waiting for others to send it back. He is in charge of molecular cloning now, and he just lost some base pairs as sequencing showed…
As the only person who can paint and design, Qing is our team's treasure without doubt. Besides drawing, she is addicted to Japanese comic and games. Meanwhile, she is  Lionel Andrés Messi's great fan.
Programmers should always be respected, so as Shubin for our wiki. He could analyze web pages and photos with particular professional insights. By the way, Tianjin's hot summer really drives him crazy.
Yige is a senior girl who is always curious about the unexplored world and enjoys life very much . She loves climbing mountain and diving, which make her close to nature. By the way, she is really addicted to Sichuan cuisine, Taiwan snacks and pizza.
Xuemei has very infectious laughters and always brings sunshine to others. She loves jogging and watching variety shows. She is in charge of human practices and the project about protein chip.
Xiangyu is a lovely sophomore boy who brings laughters to our daily work with his own humor. He takes charge of modeling on enzymatic dynamics of cutinases in our team. And he will show his fluent English in Jamboree presentation.
There is a sentence on Hua's desktop-keep calm and love mathematics. Naturally she is a member of our modeling group, and she is thought to be their boss. Her major is chemical engineering, but she dreams to study applied math in the future. Best wishes to her!
Zexiang is a senior student majoring in Biological Engineering. He is crazy about genetic engineering, playing basketball and ping-pong. He takes charge of modeling on assembly of hydrophobins and enjoys it very much.
Yifan maybe our most mysterious member because nobody has seen him except Ketong. He devotes to our wiki's programming, which is his  hobby. Hoping he will show his talent here!
Zefang Wang, Associate Professor in School of Life Sciences, helps us design the project.

Hi, I am Yuwei, a year four student in XJTLU biological science. I am sure iGEM is the most exciting and challenging competition I’ve ever experienced. Before iGEM, I also had internships in other institutes. Thus, I am responsible for the experiment parts. For me, the iGEM competition is a big opportunity for me to make a breakthrough of myself. It is not only about a great deal of new knowledge, technique and experience I can get from the experiment. Moreover, it gives me a chance to actually participate in the generation of an innovation, from the development of a new idea to finally give rise to the final production of an item.
Jiongjian Li
Hello, I’ m Jiongjian Li, a third year student major in Biology of XJTLU. This is my first year to join iGEM and it is a great honor to join this competition. The best thing in this world is thinking about new idea. That is what I do in this team. Also, I am willing to work with other teammates to achieve our goals.
Tiange Li
Hi I’m Tiange Li (Mag) and this is my first tour of iGEM. I believe it would be one of the most extraordinary things happened in my year 3 biology study. When there is a chance to make an effort on a self-designed experiment, everything taught in lectures becomes vivid and the discoveries made before just sound more exciting. I like the idea of genetic circuit and fortunately this is what we are heading for. Up to now what I’ve done most are literature review, I fresh myself when reading research articles. Thanks for my teammates' help; I now do it more efficiently. I really enjoy the time spending with them, sharing information and taking a walk from the lab. So...just hope we can finally make it!
Yakun Tang
Hello everyone! I’m Yakun Tang and I’m a year 3 student in Biological Science department of XJTLU. This is the first time I participate in iGEM. So for me, this project is like a gate which leads to a magic biology world. During the participation of this project, I learn much more knowledge than that from books, and many skills such as literature reviewing skills and experimental skills are quickly improved. More importantly, I meet and know our teammates who are all very capable and full of enthusiasm and I learn a lot from them. My work in our iGEM team is dealing with finanicial affairs as well as conducting some experiments. Both of these two need patience and carefulness, but as a smart girl^0^, I will try my best!

Refer to biosafety, people realize its significant and are more concerned about safety issues. In addition, people worry about climate change and genetically modified foods. We guided them to have a green life and always eat healthy food.
Gold
Requirement 1: Human practice expanding
First, during iGEM workshop in Shanghai ST-museum, we displayed our project as well as synthetic biology to the public. We tried to explain our idea to people without any biology background; thereby we achieved much experience of educating public, and people get knowledge and happiness from us. In addition, we used LEGO robot to mimic protein translation for presenting project. It is a creative way, by using LEGO robot, to introduce synbio and educate the public. LEGO robot is popular all over the world; people accept and like to play it. Therefore, while we using our LEGO robot to present protein translation to public, all of them can understand and feel interested in this bio-synthesis process. We tried to educate people, particularly children, with this funny method and allow more people participate in biology filed.
Requirement 2: Help other team
We provided plasmids, E. coli and Arabinose for NYU-Shanghai to support their experiment. We synthesized the two kinds of functional plasmids. One was the plasmid of FwYellow chromoprotein BBa, noted for K1033910. Another was that of Aeblue chromoprotein BBa, noted for K1033902. We also supplied 5000uL of BL21 competent cell for them to create new type of E. coli. For inducing the expression of chromoproteins, we gave them Arabinose as inducer. All these biology materials were packaged hermetically and Victor Zhou sent them to teammates in NYU-Shanghai in person in order to prevent any separation during transportation. Three weeks ago, they used our donation and made more samples.  They thanked us a lot and we were also proud of supporting other groups in iGEM competition."

Wet Lab
uOttawa's 2015 project is based on the project from 2014. Thanks to the entire 2014 team for all the hard work.
The wet lab team consisted of Martin Hanzel, Ashna Parbhakar, Erin Nguyen, Valerie Desjardins, and Alex Ross. All members helped design and build our DNA constructs. Martin Hanzel was reponsible for collecting data by flow cytometry, and creating biobricks.
Much of our work is based on years of research by graduate students in Mads Kaern's lab. In particular, Ian Roney constructed a large library of strains that serve as a scaffold for DNA assembly and transformation. We'd like to thank all of the grad students: Ian Ronay, Hilary Phenix, Nada Elnour, and Vaibhav Gupta for their infinite wisdom and support.
Many thanks go to Mila Tepliakova, our lab technician, who helped train new members and always kept the lab stocked and tidy.
Lastly, we'd like to recognize our supervisor, Mads Kaern, who generously provides lab space and the resources we need to participate in iGEM year after year.

Attributions
Each team must clearly attribute work done by the student team members on this page. The team must distinguish work done by the students from work done by others, including the host labs, advisors, instructors, and individuals not on the team roster.
Can we base our project on a previous one?
Yes! You can have a project based on a previous team, or based on someone else's idea, as long as you state this fact very clearly and give credit for the original project.
Why is this page needed?
The Attribution requirement helps the judges know what you did yourselves and what you had help with. We don't mind if you get help with difficult or complex techniques, but you must report what work your team did and what work was done by others.
For example, you might choose to work with an animal model during your project. Working with animals requires getting a license and applying far in advance to conduct certain experiments in many countries. This is difficult to achieve during the course of a summer, but much easier if you can work with a postdoc or PI who has the right licenses.
What should this page have?

We are grateful to Prof. Baishan Fang, Prof. Chaoyong Yang, Prof. Dai Wang, Prof. Xiaomei Yan and A. P. Lina Wu for their suggestion and support on our idea and lab work.
For some unknown reason, our BBa_B0030 and BBa_B0034 do not give a good performance. NJU-China sent us their copy and they worked well. Thanks for their help.
Our project got advice from captain of SYSU-CHINA , Dengwen Lai, and his suggestions enlighten us to think our project from a different view.
Ⅲ. Newsletter
Thanks to Team Stockholm on their suggestion of issuu.com.

CONTRIBUTION
Our team called for papers once the new topic occurred to us. After collecting articles, we did the layout and then distributed new issues to all teams we had managed to get in touch with as soon as possible. With the help of Paris_Bettencourt and Pasteur_Paris , Newsletter was spread all over the world. In spite of Meetups, we have Gmail, Facebook, Twitter, Skype and QQ to keep in touch with other teams in no time. Thanks to their generous help, we successfully publish our Newsletters to the public. Meanwhile, we send Newsletters as attachments to both writers and readers who we’ve contacted. In particular, we are grateful to Stockholm for offering the platform called issuu.com , which made it easier to show our issues. We really appreciated it that Professor Wayne Materi attached us a permitted version of his article named ‘Leading a Successful iGEM Team’ when we began the first issue. 'I am happy that students still consider this article useful. It is a few years old now and I haven’t been involved in iGEM for several years. I’m surprised it’s still relevant.' We’ve managed to get in touch with 76 teams who were interested in Newsletter and finally the following 52 teams from 33 countries joined us.

The bible
The E. Coli part of our project is strongly based on the paper of Bikard et al. ""Programmable repression and activation of bacterial gene expression using an engineered CRISPR-Cas system"". Bikard sent us his strains JEN202, JEN202+PWJ89 and DH5A+PWJ66. We also ordered a plasmid containing dCas9 and the synthetic DNA encoding fou our gRNAs.
Blast
02.04.2015
In our project dCas9 target DNA sequences using gRNAs and acts as an activator or an inhibitor depending on its position. Axel and Cyril created a C++ program to blast random generated  gRNA sequences on the E. Coli or Yeast genome.
And the winner is...
26.03.2015
...the new framework for biologic circuits using dCas9.
The lab starts!
24.03.2015 - 26.03.2015
TAs start to train us in the lab: medium and agar plates preparation
Brainstorming finalists
19.03.2015
Three cool ideas came out of the brainstorming:
A new framework for biologic circuits
Lung cancer therapy using dCas9
Cell-cell communication through exosomes
Brainstorming
26.02.2015 - 12.03.2015
The team is split into small groups, brainstorming for an interesting project that will occupy us during the summer.
First meeting: iGEM officially starts!
19.02.2015
First meeting with everyone: 12 teammates, 7 TAs and 3 advisors.

The Genspace team is made up of community members.
There are four adults on our team, all from various walks of life and none with advanced degrees in biological sciences. None of them had ever heard of synthetic biology prior to joining Genspace, and they have learned the science through our classes and through iGEM participation. There are twelve students from local high schools on the team. They came to Genspace because their schools could not afford to support high school teams and they really wanted to learn synthetic biology and be part of iGEM. None of them had any prior independent hands-on research experience. Genspace has a mission to provide for students like this so participation was on a first-come first-serve basis. The final four team members are college students spending the summer in New York, all of whom are majoring in the sciences. We consider all of these people part of the New York community we serve.

Team Genspace members did all the part design, wet lab work, wiki development, and will do the poster and presentation material generation. Mentors offered advice and training in lab safety and lab techniques and proofed the final submissions (wiki, registry) but did not participate in lab work. DNA that our team modified to make into BioBrick parts and devices was synthesized for us by IDT, Synbiota, or TWIST. A member of Genspace (Ali Schachtschneider, a professional designer) who is not on the team helped us design the team logo.

James Hawley
James was the Project Director for the Waterloo team this year, and his responsibilities ranged from idea creation and criticism, to making timeline and directional decisions about the project, to organizing team leads and members, to facilitating meeting with advisors and other faculty, to managing the team’s finances. He also was involved in running PyRosetta simulations for the team’s math group, planning experiments with the wet lab and math leads, and overseeing the development of the surveys and scale-up portion of the project.
Tessa Alexanian
Tessa is one of the 2015 mathematical modelling leads, a position she landed in after scraping through countless research databases to ""justify"" the simplifications for last year's CRISPR model. She tries to appear knowledgeable by nodding a lot during meetings, commenting on PRs, and telling other people to read papers she googled. Her spare time is occupied with comics, cycling, and too many unfinished crafting projects.
Matt Smart
Matt is one of the 2015 mathematical modelling leads, a position he landed after criticizing the justifications for simplifications in last year's CRISPR model. He tries to appear knowledgeable by disagreeing a lot during meetings, rejecting PRs, and telling other people to read papers he googled. His spare time is occupied with math, video games, reading, and not sleeping.
Peivand Sadat Mousavi
Peivand is the fourth year undergraduate student majouring in Honours Biomedical Sciences. She was exposed to the field of synthetic biology by joining Waterloo iGEM 2013 team. She loved the lab too much that she kept volunteering and working in different labs continuously even during the study terms. Now she is one of the wet lab lead of Waterloo iGEM 2015 and she is living in the lab and absolutely loving it! Peivand loves learning, that’s all it matters to her.
Steven ten Holder
As one of two wet lab leads, Steven contributed to early-stage design and helped train, manage, and troubleshoot the lab’s cloning and experimentation efforts. In addition to his enthusiasm for advancements in science and technology he finds time for skateboarding, piano, and entrepreneurship. His appeal for genetic engineering is best summarized by an old TED talk delivered by Gregory Stock: “A generation or so away… That's when we're going to begin to use this knowledge to modify ourselves. Now I don't mean extra gills or something -- something we care about, like aging.”
Nadine Haymour
Nadine, the Team Lead of the Policy and Practices team, helped with outreach events such as ESQ (Engineering Science Quest), and SHAD Valley. She is very interested in the ethics as well as commercialization of a produced lab product. With this interest she helped design and create a survey, and a scale-up document to explain how the lab’s product would be approved, sold, and utilized in the real world. During this, she helped a little bit in the lab for various small experiments when extra hands were needed. In her spare time she enjoys exploring new places, eating new foods and learning about very bizarre diseases and viruses, and the various methods of how to treat them.
Bill Lin
Bill has been involved in writing some funding proposals and searching for conference housing in his first year on iGEM. In his free time, he enjoys reading, cooking, painting, and listening to music.
Lab
Wet lab, protocols, and experiments
Alicia Dubinski
Alicia was involved in designing and carrying out experiments for all aspects of the project. In particular, she has been leading the design and lab work of the construction of the pCAMBIA-CRISPR plasmid, and the transformation into plants. She absolutely loves being in the lab and has grown passionate about synthetic biology. If she isn’t troubleshooting an experiment, she is probably at the rink playing hockey or watching some type of sporting event.
Apeksha Sapkota
Apeksha is a second year biochemistry student, and as a member of the Lab and Design team she has been assisting with the basic laboratory tasks. She has transformed bacterial cells, ran gels, and ligated constructs. Apeksha enjoys travelling and exploring new places when not in school or working.
Ayan A. Abukar
Ayan’s 2015 iGEM journey began with her researching for the sgRNA swap component of the project. Soon enough she found herself pipetting PCR’s, ligating constructs and conducting transformations after the sun had set with her fingers crossed awaiting the next day’s results. Aside from devoting 73% of her life to the lab and referring to herself as the ""King of iGEM"" as often as possible; the remaining 27% of Ayan’s life is devoted to her pending writing career, pretending to be a photographer and just being an endless supply of sarcasm.
Erin Laidley
Erin is the ""Queen of iGEM."" Her primary contribution involved caring for the Arabidopsis plants (affectionately referred to as “her babies”) and preparing them for floral dips. Erin also occasionally pipetted and transformed things in the lab. When she isn’t in the greenhouse, Erin can be found with her nose in a book, playing the ukulele, or making a fool out of herself at Zumba classes. Her propensity for insightful commentary is renowned throughout the team and often misinterpreted as “sass.”
Kate Beggs
Kate is a student in psychology who somehow managed to do enough biology to be useful on the lab team. She has been helping with various smaller tasks involved in the construction of Cas9 and is also organizing the testing in protoplasts. In her spare time Kate likes playing music, talking about politics, and listening to reruns of the this American life podcast. That being said she is studying for MCATs this term so doesn't really have any time to spare.
Lauren Morse
Lauren has contributed to the creation of the GFP/RFP Target plasmid and pco_Cas9 cloning.  She has been researching the structure of the Cas9 protein and the mutability of its base pairs in the design of an sgRNA swap system. Lauren is passionate about research in molecular biology and psychology, and volunteers as client support in a variety of organizations that offer counselling for mental illness, pregnancy options, and sexual health-related topics.  Her favourite movie is Cloud Atlas, and she loves finding the time on weekends to go out for a picnic and play tennis.
Patrick Diep
As the co-op student for the summer, Patrick’s colloquially known job title is “Mitochondria.” He is the lab’s powerhouse who supplies the team with energy through his relentless effort to help lead the construction of the CRISPR/Cas9 immune system, and re-engineer the sgRNA scaffold. Whether he’s running advanced multiplexing protocols, or just cleaning the lab space, Patrick is in the lab from sunrise to sunset to ensure his team leads experience as little stress as possible. Outside of the lab, Patrick’s committed to promoting gender equity through WiSTEM, welcoming first-year students with Science Orientation, and helping develop a future stem cell storage service at CryoCapsule.
Peter Hoang
Peter has mostly been involved in the diagnostics surrounding the pCAMBIA construct. Peter likes squash. Swag.
Samantha Hirniak
This is Sam's third year as a part of the Waterloo iGEM team. After spending two years doing only Mathematical Modelling for the team, she decided to venture into the lab to learn more about experimental design and protocols. Here she learned a lot about floral dips, design of genetic constructs, trouble shooting, transformation and other basic cloning techniques. She also remained involved with the Mathematical Modelling team on more of a consulting basis. She is extremely interested how we can use both mathematical theory, engineering design principles, and biological knowledge to solve problems in today's society.
Vivian Chan
Vivian has been working on various parts of the overall project. When she’s not working in her full time co-op lab, she can usually be found in the iGEM lab in the afternoons and on the occasional weekend. In her free time, Vivian likes to crochet, make paper models, and watch movies/TV series, especially those in the DC/Marvel Universe.
Zoe Wu
Zoe has primarily been helping in the lab with the various troubleshooting efforts and associated lab work involved in the team’s efforts to reach the final project goal. In addition to this, she will be actively involved with the floral dip process, nearing the end of the project where many conclusions and final results are made. In her spare time, she enjoys practicing latin dance, reading, and catching up with friends and family.
Math
Dry lab, computer lab, and MATLAB
Chris Salahub
2015 is Chris's first year participating in iGEM. Although his major is statistics, he relished the opportunity iGEM offered to try problems which are, to him, very novel. He spent the majority of his time on the team working with the different subgroups responsible for modelling the action of CRISPR and Cas9. Within these groups he mostly took minutes. When he isn't busy working on things he needs to do, he likes to lift weights, read news articles, and hang out with friends.
Emily Watson
Though Emily is an aged, cynical student (3rd year eng), this is her first year with iGEM.  It is quite refreshing.  Emily is on the Mathematical Modelling team as part of the Viral Assembly group - a group dedicated to demystifying and modelling the inner workings of CaMV infection.  Specifically, she's contributed to an intracellular network map, developing diffential equations and unearthing parameters. It has been quite a fun challenge to work on a problem with no concrete answer.  She would like to thank 'google.ca' for helping her with all the complicated biology words.
Isaac Ellmen
In Isaac's first year on the team, he was primarily involved with modelling Cas9 cuts. He also dabbled in gRNA design, protein modelling, wiki design and pretty much anything he could get his hands on. This was Isaac's first introduction to (synthetic) biology and he thinks it is absurdly cool. Outside of iGEM, Isaac enjoys coding, acting, math and crying over The Leafs.
John Drake
John is in his third year working with iGEM. This year he primarily worked with the viral assembly subteam in trying to figure out how virions are put together in infected cells and how we can stop them. He also worked with the viral spread team to build an agent-based model of viral spread because ABMs are cool. His spare time is occupied by the internet.
Joyce Zhang
This is Joyce's first year with iGEM and in university as a BioMed Eng. She is a part of the subteam which modelled and researched viral spread and plant defences. She enjoyed researching and poring over journal articles, as well as seeing ideas spring to life and building something from the ground up. Additionally, she was estatic at the opportunity to attempt to wrangle new programming languages for the sake of modelling things. In her spare time, she likes to draw and paint, contemplate the mysteries of the universe and play in orchestras.
Kevin Thai
Kevin has spent two years on the iGEM Math Modelling team, which has only served to further his indecision about which of biology and computer science is more interesting. As part of his role as part of the Tridimensional Trifecta this year, he has spent countless hours searching for and reading through almost non-existant documentation, and putting together hacky scripts in PyRosetta to determine the suitability of Cas9 mutants. In his spare time he looks up obscure music, naps while drinking coffee, and wonders how he ever ended up with so many open tabs in Firefox.
Kim Nguyen
Kim is a Biology Joint Math student and is currently 1/3 of the tri-dimensional trifecta. Her work for iGEM includes sifting through papers, helping pick out sgRNA targets, writing python scripts (while simultaneously figuring out how to python properly), and designing cas9 variants to be modelled in PyRosetta. Kim is also helping with the wiki design since she sold already sold her soul to web design for money. In her spare time she enjoys hanging out with dogs, biking places, cooking, eating dessert, and being facetious.
Laura Vaughan
This is Laura's first year as a part of iGEM after gleefully being introduced to the team last winter. Part of the Viral Assembly subgroup, she contributed an amalgamated preliminary viral network map and a large amount of research on plant defenses on the cellular level, in addition to modeling equations in SymBiology and helping out with the wiki, visuals for the final presentation and miscellaneous tasks along the way. She enjoys spending her time learning as much as she can about synthetic biology with a side of physics, design and coding.
Mark Lubberts
Mark is a biology student who's managed to escape from mechanical engineering. He's part of the Tridimensional Trifecta, and spent a lot of time trying to understand Cas9 structure, and getting PyRosetta/PyMOL set up on Windows. If he wasn't busy writing this bio he'd be looking into how to mutate Cas9 in PyRosetta as well. He helped with finding the different sgRNA targets, and also wrote a couple wiki pages. Puns cause him physical pain, though Tessa doesn't seem to mind. Because she's terrible. When not busy with iGEM he's working on his 499 project, because Lactobacillus is a cruel organism.
Robert Gooding-Townsend
This is Robert’s first year on iGEM, though he has been drifting towards mathematical biology throughout his entire degree. He investigated viral spread within plants, which involved tracking developments in this evolutionary arms race, fawning over the few papers that have explicit equations, and coding agent-based models. Unfortunately, his plot to include secret agents was against iGEM policy. In the rest of his life, he enjoys science comedy, classical music, reading a bit too intensely, and being aggressively interdisciplinary.
Zoë Humphries
Zoë has enjoyed her first year with iGEM, where her time in the Viral Spread subteam has been interesting, thoroughly challenging, and eye-opening. She researched viral transport and plant defense mechanisms, which were infinitely more complex than she realised. Learning about python and agent-based modelling was confusing at first, and then kind of awesome. She hopes to help with western blotting and coordinating all the events. In other parts of her life, she enjoys playing clarinet, rock climbing, singing running, swing dancing, and listening to podcasts (helps her pretend she’s an adult).
Practices
Human practices, policy, and outreach
Adrian Monrad
Adrian has worked on the public synthetic bio opinion survey regarding genetic modification in plants, as well scale-up extension of 2014 Cas9 plant virus intervention lab project. He also helped organize the SHAD valley high school workshop, and researched ethical and safety concerns, and promotion of synthetic biology.
Adrian van Dyk
Adrian is a second year biochemistry student at Waterloo, and this was his first year with the iGEM team, he was part of the Policy and Practices team.  Within policy and practices he focused on contacting and getting input from regulatory bodies and industry with regards to our project, as well as the legal issues surrounding CRISPR Cas9.  Adrian also helped to get the public’s opinion on genetically modification, especially with regards to crop plants, by working on a public opinion survey with the rest of the team.  In his free time he enjoys canoe tripping and camping.
Julia Zangoulos
Julia is involved in the attitude survey aiming to understand the public perspective on GMO’s and is also involved in the scale-up project. She investigated various aspect of the application of the CRISPR system as an antiviral vaccine. Julia spends most of her free time volunteering and playing piano in coffee shops. She loves physics, sketching and poetry.
Melanie Emmerson
Melanie is a third year Science & Business student and a first year member of the iGEM team.  As a part of the Policies and Practices subteam, Melanie has been involved in researching the safety of potential scale-up options and proposing techno-moral scenarios for the commercialization of the project.  She enjoys imagining what a future could look like with a little more synthetic biology in industrial design.  When she’s not at her full time co-op job or doing course work you can find her reading, travelling,or catching up on some usually much needed sleep!
Nathan Ing
Nathan is a member of the Policy and Practices and Outreach Team and is working on the scale-up project. He has contacted a number of members of the agricultural industry to assist in guiding our team’s scale up project. In addition, he will also explore the ethics and develop the techno-moral scenario. Outside of iGEM, he enjoys watching and playing sports including soccer and ice hockey as well as learning new languages.
Patricia Balbon
Patricia enjoyed having the opportunity to think about the interrelations between the world and synthetic biology again, as part of the Policy and Practices team.  She started the year with generating potential design requirements for CRISPieR Plants and later critiqued the design of a survey on gene editing and genetically modified foods, as well as created associate supplementary materials to empower the public with knowledge to engage in conversation about our project.  Patricia is an apprehensive flutist and occasionally haunts Waterloo iGEM’s lab benches as hobbies.
Riddhita De
Riddhita has involved herself with various aspects of the attitude survey, to better understand the public perspectives on GMOs. She has also been helping with the product design as part of the scale up project. About me: I treat every day as a journey to learn, dream and grow. This summer has been an especially enriching one with the iGEM team here. I enjoyed  meeting and working alongside so many driven individuals, who worked tirelessly to bring our ideas to life. When not at school, I love to travel, play a good game of Monopoly and spend time with my friends and family!
Tatiana Portelli-Graham
This is Tatiana’s first year on the Policy and Practices and iGEM team. She was excited to be a part of the science community at University of Waterloo, so much that she wore her lab coat to the try-outs! She is helping with the outreach survey that will be passed out to individuals in the community and is looking into communications as well. Tatiana is also a huge foodie, loves seeing new places, and enjoys binge watching tv shows on Netflix.

Project Management in Science
Developed by Christian and Michael Sürder
The main challenge in large scale science projects is building a well functioning and efficient team, especially when there is a high diversity of people from different fields of expertise. Comparable to differing cultures, every field has its own little language, its own typical behavior and a characteristic way of working. To only utilize the advantages of every field and to avoid misunderstandings in the proceeding of the project it is necessary to train the team to efficiently work together.
The case „iGEM“
The iGEM competition has some special challenges which had to be taken into account.
A student project with participants from different levels of knowledge
A short amount of time
Various fields of science like electrical engineering, informatics, physics, chemistry and of course biology and biomolecular engineering
Most of the students have only little to no project experience
The lab work is self-organized and also the materials are bought by the team which needs to control the costs of the project.
In the beginning of each iGEM competition, the team starts with nothing but a lab, motivated people and a little amount of money. First, one has to find a project idea, discuss if it's possible, plan the working steps and required amount of time, search for supporters and write grant application for the project. After that, the team members with little or no lab experience are introduced to the basics of lab work, theoretical and practical. On top of the scientific work, one crucial point is the presentation of our work and the communication with the general public and other researchers. Finally, our own internal communication has to be planned and organized. With all these requirements and challenges, it is imminently important to have a good start and a professional support with workshops and trainings in various fields to get everybody ready for the project.
Kick off
Figure 1: The joung iGEM Team in spring 2015 in the middle of a joint exercise.
Some people won't eat anything they've never seen before.
To avoid separation due the lack of familiarity to each other it is important to give the team an opportunity where they can get to know each other better. For that we’ve spent a whole weekend together before the start of the project. We used that time to talk about our personalities, our expertises and the experiences the team members have made so far in projects to avoid unnecessary mistakes. Together we defined rules for communication, assigned areas of responsibility and build up the whole working process for the iGEM project. The result was a motivated, loyal and well informed team and we can recommend this to every iGEM team.
Team structure
Figure 2: Christian explaining the basic structure of our team.
The team structure which we have built with the team during the Kick off was based on segmentation of the project into different subgroups. Using this strategy, we were able to work on different projects simultaneously and made it possible to work on such a big project. Every subgroup had its own leader who was responsible for his members and to overlook the progress of experiments in his team.  For not losing the overview over the whole project we determined Thomas Dohmen as the coordinator of our iGEM team who was in contact with every leader of the subgroups. The task of the coordinator was also to keep an eye on every project part and being the responsible person for external contacts.
Figure 3: Scheme of the team structure iGEM2015 TU Darmstadt
Leadership workshop
To prepare the leaders of the subgroups for their job, we trained them separately in a workshop to build some strategies for everyone to keep their team motivated and susceptible for input. We pinned down signs of problems in a group and how to handle these. Agile workflow To find and solve problems as fast as possible we established the “Monday meeting”. The leaders of every subgroup met up and gave a short update on their experiments, problems and possible solutions  of these in the last week. Afterwards the other leaders could make suggestions for different solutions. Finally, each subgroup leader presented his teams plans for the upcoming week. With this systems we were able to optimize the working process in a really short time and to react flexibly to changes or problems in the subgroups. Important is that the “Monday meeting” is rigorously moderated and as short as possible (about one hour) to lose not more time than necessary in the lab.
Subgroup communication workshop
Figure 4: Members of the subgroup ""Itaxyl"" talking about a misunderstanding.
Sometimes it is complicated to solve problems in your own group. Unfortunately these kind of problems are typical reasons for a team to break apart. To prevent these situations we met with all subgroups every six weeks and analyzed the current situation of the subgroup s together. As a result we managed to identify growing problems and solve them before they affected the team.
Poster session and presentation workshop
Figure 5: The whole team enjoying a barbeque together
Of course everybody was excited about travelling to Boston and being part of the giant jamboree. However, English is not our native language and we needed practice. Therefore we developed workshops to train our presentation skills in English. These workshops were divided in poster presentations and the project presentation. In the poster session we have to deal with the situation of a lot of people passing by and looking at our poster. The challenge is the interaction between the team members during the presentation without blocking the poster and helping each other so that our experts in the different project parts are talking to the right people. In the project presentation we have a limited amount of time to convince with our project and to highlight our achievements. So a fluent talk and a good pronunciation is important to avoid confusion. The presentation itself has to be prepared and designed under consideration of the rules and strategies for a successful talk.
How to find a sponsor
Sponsoring is one important part of iGEM. Without support it is really difficult to manage all the costs for the wet and dry lab. To prepare the members for the acquisition of sponsoring, we trained a small group of our team and sensitized them in techniques of communication and negotiations. These experts contacted companies, presented our project to them and successfully convinced them to support our team.

Socializing
Figure 6: The whole team enjoying a barbeque together
People need the chance to get to know each other besides the scientific work. Our socializing events were providing a platform for interacting in a non-professional context. We were talking about our interests and worries, our studies and families, had barbecues and mostly a lot of fun. This strengthened our team spirit and we were able to discuss and solve difficulties and disagreements within the team, based on an atmosphere of trust and respect. In specific time intervals we were launching special events, like an iGEM game day (See photo).  Such events provided a good basis for personal contacts and friendships which will endure also after the end of the project. We recommend to every team to plan these kind of events every four to eight weeks to keep the team in good spirit."

I am in the second year of my studies of BME and participate iGEM for the first time. I think it is exciting to have an own research project within synthetic biology. It offers me the chance to put forth own ideas and gain practical experiences besides student internships. I look forward to expand my horizon and cope with the coming challenges within the team.
Andreas Muttscheller
Studies: Computer Science B. Sc.
My name is Andreas Muttscheller and I am taking part in iGEM for the first time this year. Within this competition, many different people from a wide range of faculties work together on one project, putting all of their efforts into it. That is what motivated me to take part in this interdisciplinary project, far from everyday life at University hoping to gather more knowledge and experiences.
Benedict Spannenkrebs

Studies: Computer Science B. Sc., Physics M. Sc.
Semester:
Hi, my name is Benjamin Mayer, I am currently studying at the TU Darmstadt for my bachelor's degree in computer science and my master's degree in physics. I initially learned about iGEM during my bachelor thesis at the Computational Biology and Simulation group. As physicist and computer scientist I am equipped with a relatively broad theoretical knowledge from which I want to contribute to the team, e.g., in the field of modeling. For me personally iGEM is a chance to work with a large team, in comparison to the group sizes common for my field of study, on an interesting and multidisciplinary subject. Thus, through iGEM I can broaden my scope of knowledge and learn new team competences.
Bianca Reisinger
Age: 22
Studies: Biology B. Sc.
Semester: 4
iGEM is the first big project I am working on since the beginning of my studies. I am glad that I found a project which offers me the opportunity to work autonomously and independently from required classes. I am already excited about the challenges that are awaiting our team.
Carmen Sakas Gandullo
Age: 21
Studies: Biology B. Sc.
Semester: 6
I study biology in the sixth semester and learned about iGEM from members of the team. Immediately, I wanted to join them because I like the idea of creating an independent project. The knowledge learned during such a project is unique even at university. Thus, I see a one time chance to gain new experiences related to teamwork, lab skills, project design and much more and look forward to the work in the team.
Christian Sator

I joined iGEM because I like the idea of tackling a complex issue together with a team and work out solutions for it. I think iGEM is a great opportunity to experience independent and interdisciplinary research and to broaden one’s mind. I’m looking forward to learn new stuff and meet lots of interesting people.
Christian Sürder
Age: 29
Studies: Physics M. Sc.
Semester: 13
I have worked as a speech trainer and team attendant at the TU Darmstadt for a couple of years and supervised various student projects. I deal with issues of team formation, project control and interdisciplinary cohesion. Additionally, I am interested in the design and presentation of scientific contents like didactic reconditioning and mediation of complex topics. Already in 2014, I participated iGEM as project attender. This way I could gain much experience related to project control and teamwork. This year I want to gather these experiences to push the team using appropriate structures and improved concepts. Especially, I bear the challenge of the multidisciplinarity and I hope I can facilitate the establishment of iGEM as interdisciplinary competition of note within the TU Darmstadt.

Semester: 6
As one of several „winter-newcomers“ of the iGEM-team TU Darmstadt, I would like to come along with the enormously successful way the team started in 2014, and to take everything with me that is connected with such a big project. I am sure, that I will learn a lot in these months, from teambuilding to performing, as well as useful skills concerning the laboratory work. I really look forward to the collaboration within the team and the exciting challenges we are going to face until our final project is going to reveal the final results and we are allowed to present them on the big stage.

Semester: 8
I joined the iGEM team at a relative late time point of my studies. However, so far I have had only very few contact with synthetic biology. In the team I want to learn more about this field of biology and improve my scientific skills in the laboratory. I think our project is great and offers the opportunity to get insight into what it is like to do real research. Also, it is perfect to meet many people who are interested in the same topic, which enables the exchange of experiences.
Jonas Sindlinger

Semester: 4
What inspired me to participate in our iGEM team was the prospect of working on my own terms. To me it represents the possibility to escape the routines of the school-like everyday life of being a student and to gain knowledge autodidactically, which I would not otherwise.
Jonathan Pletzer-Zelgert
Age: 21
Studies: Biomolecular Engineering B. Sc.
Semester: 4
Even before I started my Bachelor in Biomolecular Engineering at TU Darmstadt I knew that I wanted to join the local iGEM Team. The possibility of being part in a group which actually does research this early in a scientific career was a huge motivation in school and later at university. Moreover synthetic biology itself fascinated me like no other science and just after a few months in my Bachelor I could say that I picked the right subject and definately had to spend a semester in the iGEM Lab.  This year I am in my fourth semester and finally able to participate. Beside everything we want to accomplish I´m also thrilled to learn Lab skills in such an intensity university itself often can´t provide.
Kathrin Hadasch
Studies: Biology B.Sc.
This year is the first time that I am taking part in iGEM. I am excited to finally work with many different people at our independently worked out project and help this team to live up on to last years’ achievements by bringing in my skills in the field of bioinformatics.
Laurin Monnheimer

Semester: 10
This year is my third time in the iGEM team. Again, it offers me the opportunity to cope with scientific issues in a practical manner. Thus it enables the one time chance to gather valuable insight and experiences to evolve myself.  I expect from the project that we present a solid solution and that I can gain experiences and have fun as part of the team.
Leon Kraus
Studies: Biology B. Sc.
I am one of the many new members of this year’s iGEM team. The achievements of last years’ teams are what fascinated me the most and also motivate me to put all my efforts into this project in order to live up to their success. I hope to be able to bring in and expand my abilities.

Semester: 12
Since 2010 I have worked besides my studies of biology as speech trainer and project attendant at the TU Darmstadt. Last year my brother and I already supported the iGEM team in the part of project management and team formation. We were glad our concept had paid off for the most part and that the project was completed successfully.  To do the project attendance and the challenge of the project cause my motivation for this year: especially the huge and interdisciplinary team.  All of us have our own concepts, no matter at which project, and we already have learned a lot. I am so excited to see if our new concept based on last year´s experience works and if it will bring our team to success in Boston.
Michelle Zöller
Age: 21
Studies: Biomolecular Engineering B. Sc.
Semester: 4
Even before I became a student at the TU Darmstadt I wanted to be a part of their iGEM  team eventually. The opportunity of working on a specially arranged research project with many different people coming from a wide range of faculties is what I was most interested in. So that is the reason why I am taking part for the first time now. I am curious for the experience and knowledge I am going to gain in terms of lab work on the one hand and managing a team consisting of so many different people on the other hand. I am excited for the work that comes along with such a project and to use and expand my abilities.
Mirjam Haun
Studies: Biomolecular Engineering B. Sc.
Even before I started my Bachelor in Biomolecular Engineering at TU Darmstadt I knew that I wanted to join the local iGEM Team. I cannot wait to work in the Lab and turn own ideas into reality independently from protocols of standard internships.I hope to be able to help bring this team to success and gather many worthwhile experiences.
Niklas Hummel
Age: 22
Studies: Biomolecular Engineering B. Sc.
Semester: 6
Servus, my name is Niklas Hummel and I am studying Biomolecular Engineering at the TU Darmstadt in my fifth semester. I already participated on last year´s iGEM team and gathered a lot of positive experiences (not only in the laboratory) as well as networking with a lot of young, motivated students. That’s why I want to be a part of iGEM TU Darmstadt 2015. I am very excited to work on this huge team on own ideas and generate an extraordinary project.
Nils Grießer
Studies: Mechatronics B. Sc.
This year is the first time that I am taking part in iGEM. I am excited to finally work with many different people at our independently worked out project and help this team to live up on to last years’ achievements.
Nina Kuschik-Maczollek
Age: 21
Studies: Biology B. Sc.
Semester: 6
Basically, I know the iGEM competition from TV. I thought, only high achiever with best grades could join such a team. When I found out that participation criteria are not more than fun and motivation it was clear: You must join them! I am totally curious to learn new practical experiences, which I can gather over time!
Phil Groenewold
Studies: Mechatronics M. Sc.
Age: 27
Semester: 10
Hi, my name is Phil and I am currently studying at the TU Darmstadt. My motivation to participate in the iGEM-Team 2015 is the interdisciplinarity this year. Biologists, mathematicians, mechatronics, computer scientists and chemists are all working on one project which is a really interesting experience. I hope to learn a lot of new things from other students with the same interests.
Sebastian Barthel
Age: 22
Studies: Biomolecular Engineering B. Sc.
Semester: 6
Who took part once, will stick to it. The last year´s project showed me what is really important during studies. And that is not boring lectures, but practical work. Thus for me it was clear to remain with the team, even before we surprisingly achieved such successes in Boston.  After my activity as assistant project coordinator last year in which I first had to grow, my slogan for this year is “build on the successes of 2014 and let it roll!” Now, I am excited to take over the more scientific part of the project coordination. And I am hoping for a good team spirit.
Sebastian Holzner
Age: 22
Studies: Biomolecular Engineering M. Sc.
Semester: 8
I wanted to join the iGEM team since getting my study license. Unfortunately, it failed because of varying reasons. The more excited am I to be part of the team 2015. I cannot wait to work in the Lab and turn own ideas into reality independently from protocols of standard internships.  Let´s go, Boston is waiting!
Sebastian Jäger
Studies: Chemistry M. Sc.
As soon as I got asked if I wanted to help this year’s iGEM team I wanted to be a part of it. The opportunity to apply the knowledge I gained within my internship at the University and work on an own project with many different people was the main motivation for me to take part in this competition and put all of my effort and abilities into it.
Simon Linder
Age: 24
Studies: Biomolecular Engineering M.Sc.
Semester: 8
My name is Simon Linder and I have been studying Biomolecular Engineering for 8 semesters now. The opportunity of working on an independently developed project far from everyday life at a University with a highly motivated team is what excites me the most about iGEM. Working theoretically as well as practically on scientific issues is a great chance to use one’s skills and gain worthwhile experiences to improve oneself in the end.
Stefan Bohn
Age: 24
Studies: Technical Biology M. Sc.
Semester: 8
I joined the iGEM team because I like to work on issues concerning synthetic biology. Although the team is quite big, I am looking forward to work with so many fellow students on the same project. Also, I like the multidisciplinary of this year´s iGEM team. This way, I can get insight into other fields of research.
Stefan Zens
Age: 21
Studies: Biomolecular Engineering B. Sc.
Semester: 4
I am part of the team for the first time and I am looking forward to the challenge working on a self-chosen project. I hope to get an instructive relief from every day studies by working on a concrete scientific issue and thereby improving my skills in the Lab. In particular I am excited about the multidisciplinarity of the project. Thus, I can get insight into other topics. I am looking forward to an exciting and hopefully successful project!
Steven Pilger
Age: 22
Studies: Biology B. Sc.
Semester: 4
I am glad I found a group at university in which I can work autonomously with other students at a project which alters from regular classes. At TU Darmstadt, I like the focus on the teamwork the most! For this year I expect to gather new experiences and findings. On a successful iGEM year 2015!
Tanja Habeck
Studies: Biomolecular Engineering B. Sc.
My motivation is based on interests for biotechnological research. The work together as a team was a great expirience for later work in the laboratory.
Thomas Dohmen
Age: 24
Studies: Biology B. Sc.
Semester: 8
It was the best choice of my previous studies to participate the iGEM team. An incredible year of iGEM is behind me in which I was able to try and learn a lot. A year ago I would have never believed that at the end I would stand in front of over 2000 scientists presenting our project. For this year we have set our sights high as well! As part of our project I want to make our team more interdisciplinary and establish iGEM as solid constant at the TU Darmstadt. I look forward to an exciting project with an awesome team. And I am happy to see our friends from all over the world in September at the Giant Jamboree!
Thomas Höhl
Studies: Computer Science B. Sc.
This year is the first time that I am taking part in iGEM. I am excited to work with many different people at our independently worked out project. I hope to be able to help bring this team to success.
Tim Böttcher
Age: 22
Studies: Materials Science M. Sc.
Semester: 8
Currently I am in the first year of my Masters degree and for the first time part of the iGEM team TU Darmstadt. I read about the publications of last year´s team and informed myself about the actual project. I got interested and I am excited to participate. I believe, that I will extend my horizon in a huge interdisciplinary team.
Tobias Wittenberg
Age: 28
Studies: Technical Biology M. Sc.
Semester: 8
After some talks to some fellow students it was clear that I want to join the iGEM team. I was informed about the free work of the last year´s project and what success was achieved. Besides spending time working on projects with fellow students, my primary goal is to improve my skills. For my work at iGEM I chose a topic I have never been in contact with. I appreciate Lab work, but I am more interested in learning new things as in this case the construction of the 3D printer.

Sven Jager
Studies: Ph.D. Biomolecular Engineering
Hello! As you can see I'm doing my PhD. I'm an oldtimer and therefore can't participate as a normal team member like I did before. So this year I work as an advisor for the team. My job is to be the mediator for frictions inside between team members. As I'm residing in the field of computational biology I'm also an advisor for the modelling group of our team.I hope I can help the team with my experience and inspire the younger students for the field of bioinformatics.
Thea Lotz
PhD Student Synthetic Genetic Circuits
As a former team member, it was self-evident that I would try and support the next generation of TU Darmstadt's iGEM student team.  It's interesting to experience the challenge of an iGEM project from a different view than that of an active student member, but I am looking forward to the chance to learn a whole new set of skills during this year's competition. I also look forward to meeting a lot of different teams from around the world, at the latest at the great Jamboree. See you there!
Advisor
Daniel Sachs
Studies: M. Sc. Biomolecular Engineering
It is now the 4th iGEM that I am taking part in even though I thought 2014 was going to be the last time for me. Since I am working on my Master Thesis at the Keasling Lab in Berkeley I am only participating as an advisor this year. I will still support the team as much as possible with the experiences I have gathered so far!"

Meet the HKUST-Rice Team!
HKUST-Rice iGEM 2015 is a large team! HKUST-Rice iGEM 2015 team is composed of 31 student members- 18 from the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology and 13 from Rice University; and 4 instructors, 2 from each university. Our team is the first cross continental team in iGEM. The benefit of forming a large joint team is that we have members from different fields who contribute different perspectives to the project.
Greetings from HKUST!
Ming Fung Cheung Eric
Year 3 Biochemistry and Cell Biology
As a responsible team leader, Eric devoted a lot of his time to iGEM. He is impassioned and consistently keeps track of each modules’ progress, (EVERY SINGLE STEP, to be precise.) While performing lab tasks, Eric is extremely focused and serious. However, he has a hidden sense of humor which only comes out if you have spent enough time with him. He can keep his blank chipmunk-like expressions and suddenly come up with a one-liner that makes everyone burst into laughter. He also has a STRONG obsession with riboregulator and other synthetic biological questions and we simply wish him all the luck to fulfill his curiosities.
Siu Wang Ng Edward
Year 3 Biotechnology
Edward is a pure gentleman. When you feel confused and discouraged by challenges, he will always say that it will be alright. He can really encourage someone even if that someone is totally lost! We do not know how he can remain calm in the face of adversity and so considerate to his teammates. Although being the Wise Man of our team he was caught red handed making origami out of aluminum foil! Team Edward!
Rina Sakata
Year 2 Biochemistry and Cell Biology
A highly perseverant and smart teammate who actively engages in the project planning and laboratory work. A girl that brings lots of vitality to the team and her open-hearted character makes her easily approachable to everyone. She is also known as the Grandma because of the “buffering” time she needs to process when someone suddenly says something to her. Her priority and dedication to lab work is truly admirable.
Khandaker Samiha
Year 2 Life Science
Samiha is a really sweet girl and you can feel it especially when she smiles at you and blink her eyes. She is in the expression platform group where she ran a lot of gel and did a lot of checking to make sure every step is reliable and successful. She was so obsessed with cloning her constructs that she woke up in the middle of the night asking ""So what do we ligate?"". As a member of the design group, she also designs things unrelated to iGEM including building a snowman using leftover ice.
Kar On Cheng Karen
Year 2 Life Science
Karen, well let’s just say the lab runs smoothly because of her. Every single day she manages to come to lab by 8:30 and no has been able to beat her record. All our daily needs, including LB, plates, autoclaved bottles, agar plates etc, is monitored by her tirelessly and voluntarily. If we can’t find something, she is the first person to go to. She can be so diligent and at the same time be the most cute and gem of a person to talk to.
Men Yi Siu Mona
Year 3 Biochemistry and Cell Biology
Mona is an intelligent graphic designer who was one of the members working on our team  logos and T-shirt, using her profession in re-filling colors of logos using painting software. She has been very patient and helpful in modifying the wiki slider for numerous trials. While doing lab work, she highly focuses on her work to make sure everything goes right. However, the only area she needs to work on is improving her “eating speed”-one of the slowest eater.
Tam Lut Fei Phoebe
Year 3 Biochemistry and Cell Biology
Phoebe is an affable, joyful and the prettiest girl ;) Besides working in lab throughout the summer, she has also come up with some of the beautiful designs in the wiki and banner. She is also named “the human incubator” as she cannot feel the cold. I think most of us could remember her as the person who wore a T-shirt in winter while we were wearing a thick down jacket. So, if our incubator is gets to crowded, we could always use her!
Yiu Pei Tung Stephanie
Year 3 Biotechnology
Stephanie boosts up the intense lab atmosphere with her humorous jokes and her greetings with “Yo peeps!. Her making up cute stories for remembering each protocol helps her group mates go through each day without panicking. Days when she catches a cold are the lucky days in lab as she uses her Mickey Mouse voice to speak. Her intentional frown face in every photo makes it easy to spot her. The girl who is also known as the “gel smasher” has another side which is a very independent and confident person. Despite all her “swag” she manages to not miss a single day of lab and helps others by her own will. If you are having a bad day, just go to her as she is the person who will know how to cheer you up. A multi tasked and a valuable member every team needs.
Brian Anugerah Urip
Year 2 Life Science
Brian is a year 2 student who is truly passionate in Biotechnology. He is sweet, smart, calm, and he can get everything under control. He is a good listener, a great friend to everyone and gives ideas to help others in their work. He loves eating dessert and he really likes Dinosaurs (weird). He is a member who is not only good at his “design” skills  but is also good at many languages including Indonesian, English and Mandarin.
Lok Yi Tang Mandy
Year 3 Biotechnology
Mandy the girl with the signature braided hair, is a kind-hearted person who is always willing to answer people’s questions. She is so calm and pleasant it is almost shocking when she makes the randomest comments. Despite living furthest away from lab amongst the team, her passion brings her to lab one of the earliest in the morning. She also showed her creativity skills as one of the person in charge of the graphic design.
Ka Man Tam Sabrina
Year 3 Biotechnology
Sabrina Tam is so friendly and adorable! Sabrina is a determined person and is really good in her laboratory skills, she loves working in the lab! She is also one of the wiki page team members who organized all our content and monitored our website very well. For a person who looks so young, she is the most mature and responsible for all the outings we had as a team. Our appreciations towards her for always taking care of us kids patiently ;)
Felicia Samin
Year 2 Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering
Feli is an Indonesian sophomore majoring in Chemical Engineering and also the secretary of our iGEM team who is responsible for the “minutes” of every single long meetings we have. She is a cheerful and a joyful person, basically she laughs a lot. She loves animals so much that she once had a peculiar pet- a kangaroo!! She has made most of the creative diagrams made in our wiki. A great friend who is there whenever anyone needs help of any sort.
Qingyang Wang Alice
Year 2 Biochemistry and Cell Biology
Alice, the girl who always smiles. She is optimistic when facing any situation. She always tries to learn new things and is persistent until she completely understands something in lab. She is doing IRE (International Research Enrichment) Program, have worked with professors in research Lab and what not, she is really one of the smartest people we have in our team.
To Yee Ki Alice
Year 2 Civil and Environmental Engineering
Alice is very amiable and helpful. She is always ready to help, in case you have a difficulty. She always talks about the mental health first aid course she attended, you may find her if you are stressed in the lab. Karen thinks people will find it’s lucky to have a friend like her.
Ho Yin Lee Thomas
Year 3 Biochemistry and Cell Biology
Thomas is a person who is highly intelligent. Sometimes you might be confused by his brilliant ideas but he will kindly explain to you. By the way, he is so tall that you are able to recognise him at a glance. Though you have to speak with your head up, you will find the conversation really interesting.
Lok Chun Chan Justin
Year 2 Life Science
Justin is a kind and patient guy who is always willing to listen and teach his teammates. His specialty and passion is in mathematics and physics, which is why he is responsible for any “modelling” work in Lab. He also willingly reads numerous research papers to help his group go forward more efficiently with all the information he gained.
Amanda Liusnando
Year 2 Life Science
Amanda, another Life Science student, a crazily diligent and surprisingly humble girl. She is the sweetest person in lab and so caring that she can do anything to make others happy. She manages to be an active member in iGEM, even with her many other roles and duties in other programs in the university (how does she do it?!) Besides, she never stops working in lab, and always asks 'what other things should we do now?'
Agnieszka Monika Lesniak
Year 2 Biochemistry and Cell Biology
Agnieszka, a Polish who somehow ended up in Hong Kong is one of the most fun person in Lab. One of her favorite procedure in the lab is microwaving the agarose solution to make gel for gel electrophoresis, a procedure she adores so much that she even made a historic gel with ddH2O instead of TAE Buffer (unintentionally!) and figured out the mistake after she ran the gel. Everyone’s laptop in the lab has tabs open for her to watch “cat videos” and read Polish news. Her strange catchphrase is “oh my God that’s disgusting!”.
Welcome to Rice!
Kendall Burks
Year 3 Biochemistry and Cell Biology
Kendall is a rising junior studying Biochemistry and Cell Biology. As a plant researcher/enthusiast, she is excited to be part of a collaborative iGEM Team working on NPK sensors (which can help plants!). Additionally, she excels strongly in sending e-mails and discussing policy and human practices while staying organized. When Kendall’s not in lab or studying for the MCAT, she can be seen playing tennis for the club team or working out in the gym like a BOSS. Additionally, she is my enabler by supplying me with an endless stream of yummy potato chips.
Steven Hao-Jen Chen
Year 2 Bioengineering
Steven, a rising sophomore born and raised in the island of Taiwan, is an optimist who is absolutely in love with Rice experience. He is generally a laid-back person who’s up for anything interesting and loves meeting new people, trying out new things, and hanging out. Having a great passion for Biology, Steven enjoys doing lab work and is fascinated by the countless intricacies and opportunities that life offers. If not studying, the usual Steven can be seen jogging(WHAT??), hanging out with friends, and singing in a Rice A Cappella group called “The Apollos.” Steven cannot say no to Japanese food and the presence of shiba inus, and he strongly believes in the motto “work hard, play hard.”
Yongin Choi
Year 3 Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering with Minor in Biochemistry and Cell Biology
On the outside, Yongin appears quiet, but he is a lean, mean cloning machine. Yongin, though a CHBE, takes difficult Biochemistry courses such as Biochemistry 1 and 2, notoriously hard at Rice University. He handles the classes with ease and calm, similar to the way that he works in the Segatori Lab. In his own way, Yongin is humorous and an active member of the Tea Enthusiasts Association.
Nikola Dyulgyarov
Year 2 Bioengineering
Member of Will Rice College. Avid photographer. Incredibly smart. Works in the Tabor Lab. No further description necessary.
John Luke Garcia
Year 2 Physics with Minor in Biochemistry and Cell Biology
John Luke is excited to go to Hong Kong and work on the NPK Project! Outside of lab, he loves to sing -- he’s in an a cappella group called the “Rice Philharmonics.”
Veronica Gough
Year 4 Bioengineering
Veronica left her native Southern California habitat to study bioengineering in Houston, TX.  She spends most of her days in lab engineering viruses (don’t worry, they’re the not-gonna-kill-you kind).  She’s always dancing, be it on the football field where she is captain of the dance team, in the library trying to memorize a complicated signaling pathway, or in lab during a wait step.  She loves to be busy, which is good because school, lab, and dance consume most of her time.  But, when she does get a break, Veronica enjoys reading fantasy novels, doing hot yoga, and eating yummy food with her friends (see picture).
Kenny Groszman
Year 3 Bioengineering
He describes himself as “tall, dark, muscular, and a liar”. Born in Argentina and residing in sunny South Florida, his aspiration for college was to escape the heat-- he ended up in Houston. On the rare occasion where he leaves the Bioscience Research Collaborative, the site of all of his bioengineering classes and his research lab, he enjoys rock climbing and being involved at his residential college.
Margaret Lie
Year 3 Biochemistry and Cell Biology
Margaret, a rising junior, is pursuing a degree in Biochemistry and Cell Biology.  A Louisiana native, Margaret has made Rice University her second home--specifically the lab where she works as an obliging slave to her constructs.  If she’s not in the lab, you’ll probably find her lending academic pearls of wisdom to her fellow students as a peer advisor and teaching assistant.  She enjoys many forms of entertainment in her (limited!) spare time--anything from refined orchestral performances to daring acrobatic feats posted on YouTube.  (We suspect she’s collecting data on how to become the next American Ninja Warrior.)   Margaret is incredibly excited to contribute to the revival of the Rice iGEM team--the school’s first since 2008--thanks to the support of HKUST!
Shilpa Nataraj
Year 4 Biochemistry and Cell Biology & Psychology
Lara Pferdehirt
Year 4 Bioengineering
Lara stayed in Texas to study bioengineering, but she tries to sneak off to her second-home, Istanbul, every chance she gets. Lara spends most of her time in lab engineering proteins. She can flow like no other, flow cytometry that is. Outside of school and lab, Lara enjoys spending time with friends, going on adventures around Houston (mainly in search of new places to eat), and watching Netflix. She needs coffee to function, and whenever there’s a cat around she finds a way to befriend it, making her a self-proclaimed cat whisperer.
Ashkan Rohani
Year 2 Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering
Who is the true Ashkan? We shall never know. All that we can gather is that he is a resident of Martel College and works in the Warmflash Lab.
Dana Smith
Year 2 Bioengineering
Dana lives a rather average life outside of iGem. She enjoys working out in her spare time and avoiding the freshman 15; however her chubby bunny, Buckwheat, has not. Dana's weaknesses include applesauce, jello, and slushies. If she's not studying or napping, she's probably on Pinterest.
Zilu Peter Tang
Year 2 Bioengineering
Some say he swam to the US from China without stopping. Some say he invented a teleporter and teleported over to the US, but promptly destroyed it because why not? Others say he disguised himself as a normal person and flew over here like the rest of us normal folk. But one thing is for certain, this originally Chinese native is in the United States. This being, or whatever you call him, spends a lot of time at the gym, perfecting his already perfectly chiseled body. He is a studious, party animal, one of the few who can go out on a Saturday night and still complete his differential equation homework afterwards at 3 am. He is currently a sophomore pursuing bioengineering at Rice University, and is already learning how to make bacteria perform his bidding. However, just like Superman has his kryptonite and Scooby Doo his Scooby snacks, Peter Tang does have his weaknesses. He cannot say no to a homemade cookie and is addicted, ADDICTED to Pirates of the Caribbean, this dude just can’t get enough.

Our Team
The 2015 GSU-iGEM team is made up of extraordinary men and women. In the last nine months we have gone from having no lab experience to where we are today. We have collaborated with local Atlanta businesses, such as the Atlanta Botanical gardens, reached out to Georgia Legislatures, and educated thousands of children about synthetic biology. Continually pushing to better ourselves and overcome challenges we have grown as individuals, scientists, and a team this year. Some of our hobbies are: autoclaving keyboards, playing with Legos, and Tran’s promotering.

Our Team
Our Sponsors
With the generosity of these institutions and companies, our team was able to conduct the research for our project and attend the Giant Jamboree in Boston. Thank you so much!
Marcelo Marcet
What would we do without Marcelo? Throughout the summer, Marcelo was not only our advisor - he was our mentor, our lab father-figure and most importantly, our friend.
He has been involved in all of the aspects of our project. He taught us all the tips and tricks for working in the lab; he helped us get funding and sponsorship; he was our voice in our institution; and he was heavily involved in all of the animation and 3D modeling in our project.
Without Marcelo, our team would never have come together. Thank you so much, Marcelo. Words can never express our gratitude for you.
Mattéa Bujold
Without Mattéa, there is no Team NAIT 2015. Alongside Marcelo, Mattéa was directly involved in bringing our team together.
She is our lab guardian - making sure we always had everything we needed to carry out and complete our experiments. From protocols to ordering reagents, we could always count on Mattéa. She was always willing to sacrifice her time and bestow us with her knowledge and extensive lab experience.
We are so thankful for her involvement in this project. We've learned so much from her and we are proud to say that she is our mentor and friend. Thank you so much, Mattéa. We could never repay you for your kindness (and your patience with us).
Eduardo A. R. Serratos
Humble, intelligent, passionate, kind, handsome, guapo - these are just some of the few words that we can use to describe our team leader and captain, Eduardo.
He was instrumental in our entire project. He took responsibility for the majority of the lab work and conducting of experiments. In addition to that, Eduardo kept our entire group organized and focused on our end goal. Eduardo really had a hand in everything - he attended meetings on behalf of our team, he conducted research and assisted in literature review, filled out our lab log books with David (with extreme neatness), and somehow, he was always willing to do more. Eduardo never missed a day coming into lab, and even came in on the weekends.
Eduardo has truly been an indispensable asset to the team and an even better friend. We could always count on him to listen, advise and provide the emotional support in this chapter of our lives. Friends are the siblings that we were not originally given. It is an honor for us to be your ""siblings"" - to be your iGEM family. Thank you, Eduardo, oh Captain, our captain.
David Barilla
You will never meet a kinder, more loyal man than Mr. David Barilla. Although he was extremely busy balancing work, iGEM, and family - he always made time to come to NAIT everyday and work on our project - even if that meant losing precious sleep and workout time.
In our team, David spearheaded the documentation of our experiments and protocols; kept us all grounded and sane; wrote SOPs and logbooks; developed our modified silver stain protocol; and helped in the lab to run experiments (plasmid precipitation, cloning, and mini-prep among many) with Eduardo. David even went as far as learning to code HTML to try and share the load with his more computer savvy team mates.
""Best friends are people who make your problems their problems, just so you don't have to go through it alone."" There is no better way to describe David. He always knows the right thing to say to bring a smile to everyone's face. He has an amazing sense of humor but also knows when to get down to business. Thank you, David. The summer has been an absolutely amazing experience with you in the lab! We will always treasure your random bursts of classic rock and even your incredible (yet sometimes outrageous) ideas.
Johannes Coomansingh
Joe is the light of our team. His incredible sense of optimism has really helped our team stay positive throughout all the speed bumps of our project. Without Johannes to brighten our lab days with his ramblings and non sequiturs, our iGEM journey would have been much more stressful. Thankfully, he was present everyday to keep us lighthearted.
Joe really is Mr. Congeniality. As our ""HR Guy"" he has really gone above and beyond all of our expectations. Throughout the project, Joe was our public voice and was in charge of all external relations such as collaborations, looking for sponsorship and even managing our Twitter account. In addition to public relations, Joe was also heavily involved in lab work. He assisted David in developing our silver stain protocol and helped develop our experimental design with Mattéa.
A day without our friend Joe is very quiet, and almost lonely. His presence (and sneeze) fills the entire room with a kind of light and positivity that many people lack or take for granted. Joe has the ability to see the silver lining in the darkest storm cloud and for that, we are very thankful. Thank you, Joe! May your beard grow strong and great.
Abbie Gottert
Abbie is one of the most caring, friendly and empathetic people you will ever meet. Between assisting with Logo and Banner design, reviewing the literature, helping Johannes out with the policy and practices, and assisting with lab work, she finds the time to have a full time job and maintain a balance between them. Always concerned with the well being of the group, she goes out of her way to make sure that everyone stays healthy, happy and mentally sound.
Thank you so much, Abbie. Although you couldn't be with us all the time in lab, we always knew you were there in spirit - whether it be a GIF image sent in chat or popping in in the late afternoon after your other shift. ""Good friends are like stars, you can't always see them but you know they're always there."" Abbie is our good friend and has been a shining star in our team.
Joy Ramielle L. Santos
Meh.
Kevin Setzer
Throughout the summer, Kevin was extremely busy working full time while also helping out our iGEM team. Though most of his contribution was done outside of NAIT, we could not have grown into the team we are today without Kevin Setzer.
Kevin mostly worked with Joy in the coding and designing of Team NAIT's Wiki sites. He was the bug exterminator, the very necessary second pair of eyes involved in editing all the HTML, CSS and dreaded Java that coded our wiki. Additionally, Kevin also helped in the post-production processes of our 3D animation (i.e: After Effects and Photoshop editing). When he could, Kevin also came to the lab to help prepare reagents necessary for processes and experiments later in the day.
Although busy, Kevin tried his best to find time and help out our iGEM team. Thank you, Kevin! Together, we've gone to infinity... and beyond!

Our Team
Our Sponsors
With the generosity of these institutions and companies, our team was able to conduct the research for our project and attend the Giant Jamboree in Boston. Thank you so much!
Marcelo Marcet
What would we do without Marcelo? Throughout the summer, Marcelo was not only our advisor - he was our mentor, our lab father-figure and most importantly, our friend.
He has been involved in all of the aspects of our project. He taught us all the tips and tricks for working in the lab; he helped us get funding and sponsorship; he was our voice in our institution; and he was heavily involved in all of the animation and 3D modeling in our project.
Without Marcelo, our team would never have come together. Thank you so much, Marcelo. Words can never express our gratitude for you.
Mattéa Bujold
Without Mattéa, there is no Team NAIT 2015. Alongside Marcelo, Mattéa was directly involved in bringing our team together.
She is our lab guardian - making sure we always had everything we needed to carry out and complete our experiments. From protocols to ordering reagents, we could always count on Mattéa. She was always willing to sacrifice her time and bestow us with her knowledge and extensive lab experience.
We are so thankful for her involvement in this project. We've learned so much from her and we are proud to say that she is our mentor and friend. Thank you so much, Mattéa. We could never repay you for your kindness (and your patience with us).
Eduardo A. R. Serratos
Humble, intelligent, passionate, kind, handsome, guapo - these are just some of the few words that we can use to describe our team leader and captain, Eduardo.
He was instrumental in our entire project. He took responsibility for the majority of the lab work and conducting of experiments. In addition to that, Eduardo kept our entire group organized and focused on our end goal. Eduardo really had a hand in everything - he attended meetings on behalf of our team, he conducted research and assisted in literature review, filled out our lab log books with David (with extreme neatness), and somehow, he was always willing to do more. Eduardo never missed a day coming into lab, and even came in on the weekends.
Eduardo has truly been an indispensable asset to the team and an even better friend. We could always count on him to listen, advise and provide the emotional support in this chapter of our lives. Friends are the siblings that we were not originally given. It is an honor for us to be your ""siblings"" - to be your iGEM family. Thank you, Eduardo, oh Captain, our captain.
David Barilla
You will never meet a kinder, more loyal man than Mr. David Barilla. Although he was extremely busy balancing work, iGEM, and family - he always made time to come to NAIT everyday and work on our project - even if that meant losing precious sleep and workout time.
In our team, David spearheaded the documentation of our experiments and protocols; kept us all grounded and sane; wrote SOPs and logbooks; developed our modified silver stain protocol; and helped in the lab to run experiments (plasmid precipitation, cloning, and mini-prep among many) with Eduardo. David even went as far as learning to code HTML to try and share the load with his more computer savvy team mates.
""Best friends are people who make your problems their problems, just so you don't have to go through it alone."" There is no better way to describe David. He always knows the right thing to say to bring a smile to everyone's face. He has an amazing sense of humor but also knows when to get down to business. Thank you, David. The summer has been an absolutely amazing experience with you in the lab! We will always treasure your random bursts of classic rock and even your incredible (yet sometimes outrageous) ideas.
Johannes Coomansingh
Joe is the light of our team. His incredible sense of optimism has really helped our team stay positive throughout all the speed bumps of our project. Without Johannes to brighten our lab days with his ramblings and non sequiturs, our iGEM journey would have been much more stressful. Thankfully, he was present everyday to keep us lighthearted.
Joe really is Mr. Congeniality. As our Public Relations expert he has really gone above and beyond all of our expectations. Throughout the project, Joe was our public voice and was in charge of all external relations such as collaborations, looking for sponsorship and even managing our Twitter account. In addition to public relations, Joe was also heavily involved in lab work. He assisted David in developing our silver stain protocol, helped develop our experimental design with Mattéa and also created our team's Human Practices project!
A day without our friend Joe is very quiet, and almost lonely. His presence (and sneeze) fills the entire room with a kind of light and positivity that many people lack or take for granted. Joe has the ability to see the silver lining in the darkest storm cloud and for that, we are very thankful. Thank you, Joe! May your beard grow strong and great.
Abbie Gottert
Abbie is one of the most caring, friendly and empathetic people you will ever meet. Between assisting with Logo and Banner design, reviewing the literature, helping Johannes out with the policy and practices, and assisting with lab work, she finds the time to have a full time job and maintain a balance between them. Always concerned with the well being of the group, she goes out of her way to make sure that everyone stays healthy, happy and mentally sound.
Thank you so much, Abbie. Although you couldn't be with us all the time in lab, we always knew you were there in spirit - whether it be a GIF image sent in chat or popping in in the late afternoon after your other shift. ""Good friends are like stars, you can't always see them but you know they're always there."" Abbie is our good friend and has been a shining star in our team.
Joy Ramielle L. Santos
Joy is joy.
The trails that each human being transits throughout a lifetime can lead to meeting incredible people. We are very happy that our paths came across one truly valuable and amazing girl; Joy.
A real treasure chest, she was good at every aspect our project needed; lab work? You got it! Coding? Consider it done! Making molecular animations? Easy for her! Nonetheless, her biggest trait is her kindness and empathy towards others; assets that make her a true friend, one you wish to always hang around with. Though she might be quiet when working in the lab, one could occasionally glance at her face and get a nice smile as a response. Such priceless, unspoken moments could convert our days into memories. Memories that will accompany us throughout our lives, throughout those trails which we'll now transit with a great friend, with Joy.
Kevin Setzer
Throughout the summer, Kevin was extremely busy working full time while also helping out our iGEM team. Though most of his contribution was done outside of NAIT, we could not have grown into the team we are today without Kevin Setzer.
Kevin mostly worked with Joy in the coding and designing of Team NAIT's Wiki sites. He was the very necessary second pair of eyes involved in editing all the HTML, CSS and dreaded Java that coded our wiki. When he could, Kevin also came to the lab to help prepare reagents necessary for processes and experiments later in the day.
Although busy, Kevin tried his best to find time and help out our iGEM team. Thank you, Kevin! Together, we've gone to infinity... and beyond!

ATTRIBUTIONS
Missouri S&T iGEM is entirely student-run as a design team under the Student Design and Experiential Learning Center . All lab work is performed by members trained through our Lab Training Program. Our members chose our project with inspiration from Wagenigen UR 2014 and Toulouse 2014 , and our wonderful advisors Dr. Katie Shannon and Dr. David Westenberg are always available for advice.
Our lab received generous financial support from the Biological Sciences, Chemistry, and Chemical Engineering departments at Missouri S&T, and Fred Kielhorn. New England BioLabs and Bio Basic provided us with essential lab supplies, and the free DNA from Integrated DNA Technologies formed an integral part of our project this year.
Our speakers at our White Nose Syndrome Symposium, Shelly Colatskie, Anthony Elliot, Dr. Sarah Hooper, and Dr. Lynn Robbins, made the event possible.
The Crow Lab at Georgia State University kindly offered to test our project on live P. Destructans.

Rachel's Notebook
6/1/2015 : Day 1
Today was the first day in the HCI lab! We had orientation this morning, and I met my teammates Sam and Vivien, today. I also met the other people who will be working in the HCI lab as well this summer. We also had lab orientation and learned more about the HCI lab and all the cool tech in the lab. Before we did anything concerning the multitouch screen, we read up and familiarized ourselves with the iGEM requirements for the community track. We read up on all the qualifications a team needs to get a Bronze, Silver, and Gold medal.  We also explored around the iGEM website for a bit.  After that, we downloaded Cornerstone SDK, a software development kit that is used to create applications for multitouch screens. One thing we noticed was that C++ was the most common language that is used, and we had decided to use Javascript.  So we fiddled around with the few examples in Cornerstone that were in Javascript and used those examples as a baseline for our helloecoli app we were going to start working on this week.
6/2/2015: Day 2
Today we started working on our own application. We initially had randomly colored squares that when tapped on, they duplicated.  We changed the squares to circles which also when tapped on, duplicated. At this point, the circles were resizeable with the right hand gesture. The circles also went off the screen. Orit met with us to see what we had so far and gave us the suggestion to make the circles look more like e.coli. We decided to try to change the shape to an ellipse.
6/3/2015: Day 3
Today, we had guests from NYU come in to talk with the other PGHCI team.  Sam, Vivien, and I joined them, and they have a very informative talk about genetics. After the talk, we went back to playing around with our app. We changed the circles to ellipses. And when the ellipses consumed/ran into each other, the ellipse being consumed turned into a circle inside the other ellipse.  We then brainstormed and decided that we were going to introduce the concept of bacteria and viruses.  We decided to make the viruses, circles and the bacteria to be ellipses. And only the virus could be consumed by the bacteria, and the viruses could not consume each other and vice versa for the bacteria. One problem we ran into was the fact that the viruses were still widgets. So when the virus was consumed, it had difficulty staying inside the bacteria. However, after fiddling with Cornerstone, we figured out how to create Children, and the viruses stayed inside the bacteria and did not leave the bacteria.
6/4/2015: Day 4
Thursday was a SUPER productive day. We got a lot done! We FINALLY figured out how to set the boundaries so that the widgets won’t leave the screen. We also got them to bounce of the sides of the screen as well. The viruses and bacteria now randomly move around the screen, independent of touch. We also disabled free rotation and set the scale so that the widgets do not change size when touched. We also introduced marker action and recognition to our app. When you tap a marker on the screen, a new bacterium is created. The bacteria also grew to a certain size and divided into two smaller baby bacteria.  This was to mimic (not super accurate) mitosis and the asexual replication of bacteria. It copies the way that bacteria duplicates (increases to double its size and then divides into two at its midline),  When a virus is tapped on, more viruses were created. However, we came across an interesting problem.  When the widgets ran into each other, sometimes they bounced off of each other. Occasionally, they end up being in a limbo state where they do not bounce off of each other and start to shake.
6/5/2015: Day 5
We have started programming specific actions for specific markers-- now, one marker creates a new Bacteria, one removes that specific Bacteria, and one displays the bacteria’s infection status with a simple attached textbox that states “Infected” or “Not infected”.  We explored around with the Image Widget so we can use our own images later for our project. After this week, we really found out how much flexibility we have with this project, and we can do many things with this screen.  We decided that we also wanted explore video widgets more in the near future!!!
6/8/15: Day 6
Before natalie came in today, the iGEM team played a bit more around with the cornerstone SDK. Natalie came into today, and she was fabulous. She held a workshop for us, and covered everything from the basics of synthetic biology to summaries of a couple of famous iGEM projects from the past. We also showed her some of our previous projects such as Bac to the Future and Synflo. It was super helpful because she gave us a lot of suggestions about how to make synthetic biology more accessible and more approachable to the general public.  We also talked about how to convey that synthetic biology is still very new and it is quite a lengthy process to create new things. We also talked about the ethical concerns that come along with synthetic biology and how to approach in a museum exhibit setting.
6/9/15: Day 7
We also had our potluck today. Johanna brought a beautiful dish and Christina made really yummy gluten free brownies.  Around 2:30, we skyped Romie and Anja from the Innovation Museum. They are our collabotors we are working with on this iGEM project this summer! We are super excited to meet them very soon! We presented our brainstorms that we thought of this morning. They provided us with some really great feedback! They told us that they really liked the idea of space exploration for our project, so that can be a project idea possibility!
6/10/15: Day 8
Today, we fiddled around with the multitaction screen a bit more.  We introduced the multiple markers to the screen as well as experiment with the marker sizes.  We found the smallest optimal size of markers we could use, and we also looked more into the process of marker recognition.  For lunch, we went to a program-wide lecture about cyanococchus bacteria.  It was really interesting to hear about what other scientists in different fields such as microbiology were doing.  We also got free lunch at the lecture today. After lunch, we played around with the multi-taction screen more, and tweaked a couple of things like the background of the screen as well as marker recognition.
6/11/15 Day 9
We got a lot of work done today! We developed prototype for certain designs for our markers today. We also worked on our MarsTest program today.  We looked into the hardware of the marker recognition. So we experimented with laser-printed markers vs. inkjet printers to see if the quality of the markers actually influenced the recognition on the multitaction screen.  For a lot of the day, we tested out different marker sizes and found the optimal marker size for the screen. We also added functionality that allowed for up to four markers to be recognized by the screen.   We also played around with a keyboard widget to add into our program! This  was super exciting because in the future, users of our program will be able to add their usernames! We need to play around with this more. Every Thursday we also have a department wide talk during lunch.  We had two professors from the CS department talk as well as a physics professor and a math professor talk about their research. I really enjoy going to these talks because it’s really cool to learn about what professors are doing and the fact that even professors still do ongoing research! I really like learning about what other people from various concentrations of science do.
6/12/2015: Day 10
We created a new interface today. We came up with this really cute interface that asked users to pick their favorite flavor.  Once they picked their fruit, they can drag it into the flask and the flask is then tipped, another message pops up that says what flavor the user has picked.  We also had another google hangout call with Romie and Anja from the Innovation Museum. We are so excited that they are coming into the HCI lab this Monday! We showed them what we have done on the multi-taction screen thus far. We are so excited to brainstorm and collaborate with them next week.
6/15/2015: Day 11
Romie and Anja from from the Tech Museum came to Wellesley today. I was so happy to finally meet them and work with them in person.  They talked to us a bit about what the Tech Museum’s philosophy is and what they were looking for in their exhibit.  After they told us a little bit about their museum and their work, we proceeded to show them our current prototype programs we created for the past 2 weeks. We also then started phase 1 of brainstorming for what our exhibit will be and also what kind of experience we wanted the visitors of the museum to have.  We started brainstorming by using two broad parameters, Big Frame and Places.  Then we started to name anything that popped up in our heads. After going back and forth for a bit and discussing what we wanted, we settled with possibly calling the exhibit BacPack and having three extreme environments: Mars, The Deep Ocean Cave, and Antarctica. After that, we came up with some criteria and some goals for this exhibit. We also listed some of the environment details as well as what could possibly be engineered in those different environments. That night, Vivien, Sam, and I were all assigned to research some past iGEM projects
6/17/2015: Day 12
Today was a day full of paper prototyping. I felt like I was in elementary school again from all the paper cutting and coloring. It was honestly a lot of fun and super helpful because I got to really understand every single step of our interaction and our prototype.
6/18/2015: Day 13
Today we did more prototyping, and we actually finished our prototype!!!! Orit’s children also came by to interact with our paper prototype. They were very engaged and interested in the prototype, and we ran through the prototype a few times with both of them. They gave us really interesting and helpful feedback such as adding videos to our project, and challenge states that added more complexity to our prototype. We are going to talk about their feedback in depth tomorrow and next week.
6/19/2015: Day 14
Today we went to the NEGEM meetup at Boston University.  A lot of different team from various schools in the New England area came. It was really exciting to see so many people at this meet up. To be honest, I was really nervous to present today because the whole room consisted of people who were very experienced with biology. It was cool to sit through all the presentations about project ideas. NEGEM was really helpful because we got a lot of really helpful feedback from the people participating. It was definitely a great experience.
6/22/2015: Day 15
Today we started creating our first actual prototype for the BacPack iGEM project on the multitaction screen.  We started adding some basic widgets such as text widgets and image widgets that we need for our first digital prototype. I am super excited to work more on the multitaction.
6/23/2015: Day 16
We some trouble today with the marker recognition. One cool functionality of the screen is that it can recognize marker codes, and we are planning to use these marker codes for our tangibles. However, there was still some issues with the screen recognizing the markers correctly, so we tried messing around with the settings. However, that didn’t seem to help much. We are hoping that we will figure this out soon.  We went out towards the end of work to get some ice cream at JP licks.
6/24/2015: Day 17
Today we worked more on the functionality of the prototype. We also went to the program wide seminar. A Wellesley alum talked about her chemistry career, and it was very inspiring.
6/25/2015: Day 18
We continued to work on the functionality of the prototype. We had some doubts about the current prototype because it was not taking full advantage of the multitaction screens and the capabilities that come along with the screens. One downside about our current prototype is that it is not collaborative or multi-user and only one user can interact with the screen at a time. This did not make sense to me because one our main goals when we were brainstorming with Romie and Anja was that we needed a collaborative space. We asked Orit about our concerns, and he agreed with us as well. I think we are going to overhaul or initial design and start brainstorming again for a new layout!  We also filled out iGEM forms that are due tomorrow. Super excited about iGEM!!!!
6/26/2015: Day 19
The first of our interns came today! Melissa is a sophomore in high school. She is super cool and seemed to be excited to hang out and work with us in the HCI lab. Today, we worked on multiple sketches of our exhibit. One thing that I really emphasized in the layout is having individual workspaces and a shared space that is collaborative. I think Sam and Vivien liked this idea as well, so I think we are going to proceed in this direction. Lauren, one of the Wellesley alums working in the lab, also brought some very cool ideas to the table such as introducing duplication and status bars. In addition, Mike Horn from NorthWestern came to visit us in the lab. He showed us some really cool exhibits and games that he created, and he also gave us a lot of feedback on our current prototypes. He also referred us to a lot of papers for us to read about interactive museum spaces and tabletops.
6/29/2015: Day 20
We started to reiteration process. So THUS BEGAN PAPER PROTOTYPE ROUND 2!!!!! We spent much of the day brainstorming and discussing possible new designs with Orit and the rest of the team. To be honest here, I have a love/hate relationship with paper prototypes. But trust me people, paper prototypes are super important and necessary when designing interfaces. They are so so important, and a lot of thought and detail is put into these prototypes that are valuable when designing the real thing.
6/30/2015: Day 21
A Wellesley alum came to visit us in the lab. She has been in the design industry for a while and gave a lot of great insight and feedback while brainstorming. After having a great discussion with her and  reflecting on a lot of her suggestions, the team and I iterated again, the paper prototype. Finally towards the end of the day, we finally came up with the current iteration of our paper prototype.
7/1/2015: Day 22
Today, Natalie came to visit our lab. We gave her a short presentation about our project and then she looked at our paper prototype. She gave us a lot of suggestions and feedback for us, and it was super helpful to have someone who is a synthetic biologist to come in and look over our project. The other interns came today as well. We spent most of the day filming our paper prototype. We also sent a video of our new paper prototype in action to The Tech today as well. Casey, who has worked in the lab previously and has participated in previous iGEMS also came into as they are helping us with a lot of the graphics for our project.
7/2/2015: Day 23
Today we worked on finishing up our paper prototype as well as editing our word choice and phrasing of words. We also went to the CS/Math/Physics lecture today during lunch time. The editing and word choice was pretty in depth and very detail oriented so it took us a while to determine all the phrasings in the project that are going to be used.
7/7/2015: Day 24
Casey came and visited us. We talked about design and we also discussed the challenges with our design. They had some really good sketches planned out already which is super exciting. I always wished I was super good a drawing and designing, and I was super amazed by how awesome Casey is! ! ! !
7/8/2015: Day 25
We have a presentation at the department presentations tomorrow. I’m pretty nervous because this is our first presentation at Wellesley as a team. While we had some practice talking at NEGEM, I was nervous because in the audience will be friends and professors that I know well. We revamped our entire presentation layout and aesthetic, and we even included some videos of our multitaction prototype.
7/9/2015: Day 26
Presentation at department talks: We had our presentation today! Sam, Vivien, and I were pretty nervous, but we finished successfully. Our fellow classmates gave us some good feedback, and we are happy that it got positive responses at this talk.
7/10/2015: Day 27
We went to the Museum of Science! I became an emotional mess at the Pixar Exhibit. Orit recommended that we take a lab outing to the newly opened Pixar exhibit for some inspiration. The exhibit itself was phenomenal. I did not realize how much work and iterations that went into creating these films.
7/13/2015: Day 28
Casey sent us some really cool artwork. We started adding and using their artwork into our prototype. It was really cool seeing our project looking more space-y.
7/15/2015: Day 30
Today we did a lot of math. We had a difficult time with figuring out the math for the flasks tilting towards the Mars environment. After a few hours and a lot of tinkering with equations, we finally got our flasks to empty towards the center! Hallelujah! Later in the afternoon, the MIT app inventor team came by and looked at what was going on in the lab.
7/16/2015: Day 31
Today, I got to listen to a lot of my friends’ presentations from the other departments. My roommate actually presented today on her physics research. It was super cool to see what others have done. We also went to Larry’s machine shop today. It was really cool to get laser cutting trained. We learned how to laser cut, and it was a lot of fun!
7/17/2015: Day 32
We did a lot of work before the iGEM meet-up tomorrow. We added more functionality to our project such as adding message bubbles that instructed people on how to proceed.
7/18/2015: Day 33
MIT and the BU iGEM team came over to Wellesley today. We had a lot of fun testing our prototype with students that came today.  Also we got to hear their feedback on our project and they gave us some wonderful suggestions. Also, we got to hear what the other teams have been working on since we last met. It was super cool for them to come over and play with all the gadgets in the lab!
7/20/2015: Day 34
We spend a lot of time on functionality today as well.
21/7/2015: Day 35
We got the status bars to work today! They were easier to make than we expected them to be. The status bars decrease automatically as time passes! We also talked to Anja and Romie briefly. They gave us feedback on our current prototype and also gave us updates on the wetlab portion that they are working on.
22/7/2015: Day 36
Today, Casey sent us more images. They sent us message bubbles for us to insert into our prototype. So we incorporated the new message bubbles that guide users during the experience. In addition, we also tested the prototype with 3 high school interns.  We looked to see how they interacted with our current prototype. We also asked them for feedback.
23/7/2015: Day 37
This morning, WE FIXED ONE OF THE MAJOR BUGS THAT WE HAVE BEEN STRUGGLING WITH FOR THE PAST WEEK. Wohoo, we realized that there was something wrong with how we constructed the marker recognition. We fixed by simply creating a new array when the plasmid is cleared. It was such a simple fix. We also realized that Johanna is a wonderful human and gave us a lot of suggestions. If Johanna is around, everything ends up working out.  Also, around 50 kids from Upward Bound came in today to test our prototype and provided us with a lot of wonderful feedback.
24/7/2015: Day 38
We worked on various things. We wrote and submitted our two abstracts that are due for the Wellesley Summer Science Research. We also looked at the various bugs that we found yesterday, and we fixed a couple. We also changed some formatting and switched from buttons to tabs for some of the information that will accompany the exhibit.
27/7/2015: Day 39
WOW can’t believe it is the final stretch!  We got a lot done today!!!!!!!! Casey sent us more art so we updated all the animations. We also made the status bars glow when they are updated. We also programmed the bacteria to go to a certain part of Mars based on their “haves” when deployed. I fixed all the tabs and made them look more integrated with the environment, and we also fixed the never-ending duplicating in flask bug that we have been fiddling around with for the last couple of days.  Here are some of the things that we checked off our to-do list!!! Update art from Casey Make decreasing status bars more visible Program bacteria to go to a certain part of Mars make tabs larger fix neverending duplication
28/7/2015: Day 40
It’s really crunch time. We spent a lot of time coding and adding final touches to BacPack.
30/7/2015: Day 41
Wow today was the poster session! I can’t believe that this experience at Wellesley summer research has come to an end. I am not too sad still, because I will still be in the lab this fall. It was interesting and really fun to present BacPack to the Wellesley students, professors, and community. We got a lot of interesting feedback from them, and they helped us out by playing around with the prototype.
31/7/2015:  Day 42
We started planning out what our wiki would look like, and what the content inside of it would be. We had a skype call with Romie and Anja today. They gave us feedback on what to modify before we went over to the Tech next week.  We also decided that we wanted to introduce error states to our prototype.  Monday, August 1st:  Vivien and I tweaked BacPack a little bit. We introduced general error states that popped up when the wrong resource was used.
8/6/2015: Day 43
Almost everyone in the lab left! Lauren, Jasmine, and I are the only people here now. It was pretty sad and lonely today, not seeing all our other lab buddies come to work today. I made the error states more customized. The error message printed out what resource was not available.
8/7/2015: Day 44
Today I flew to California!! It’s still surreal that I am in San Jose to test our prototype! I am still in shock. We landed at the airport and went straight to the Tech Museum. Romie and Anja were there to greet us!!! There we set up the multitaction and went over how we are going to do user studies Saturday and Sunday. RIght after, Lauren and I went back to the hotel and passed out.
8/8/2015: Day 45
First day of testing!!!!!  I was exhausted after a full day of testing. It was really cool to see how people interacted with the prototype. I found that most people were very interested and excited to play with our exhibit.  It was also cool to see Romie and Anja set up a mobile wetlab, and to also see how kids interacted with the wet lab component as well.
8/9/2015: Day 46
Final day of testing. We decided to move our user study location to a more central part of the museum. This was a good idea because we got a lot more people that fit the age demographic we were concentrating our learning goals on. We also asked post-interaction questions to see how much the kids learned from briefly interacting with the prototype. Later, Romie and Anja let us explore the Tech Museum. It was so much fun wandering around and playing with some of the coolest exhibits! I’m sad that this is my last day in San Jose, but I really enjoyed doing these user studies!!!
Sam's Notebook
6/1/2015: Day 1
Today was the official start of summer research and work in the HCI Lab. We spent the first half of the day in general orientation, then started work in our teams. Rachel, Vivien, and I are the three Wellesley members of the Wellesley - The Tech Museum of Innovation team for iGEM 2015. Our afternoon was split between getting acquainted with the technical environment and getting acquainted with the iGEM contest and synthetic biology. We got the Cornerstone SDK software, and looked at examples of code and documentation to become familiar with its capabilities. We also looked at previous years’ iGEM teams, specifically the Wellesley ones. This years project is a continuation of sort of the 2012 Wellesley iGEM project SynFlo, so we paid particular attention to that. We’re just starting off, but it seems like a good start!
6/2/2015: Day 2
Second day at the lab! Today was dedicated to exploring the functionality of the cornerstone software. We made our first HelloWorld app in Javascript. Cornerstone also offers functionality using C++, but we decided on Javascript as a more malleable and accessible language to use. Our first app consisted of a few rectangles on the screen, which can be moved around by the users and duplicate when tapped on. Our long-term goal is to develop customized Widgets that would simulate bacteria and viruses, so later in the day we began exploring drawing customized shaped. By the end of the day, we had circles! Tomorrow we’ll explore more of the shape and customization possibilities.
6/3/2015: Day 3
Similar to yesterday (and likely the rest of this week), today was spent playing around with the available Widget features. We changed the shape of the Widgets to ellipses, hopefully moving towards a more E.coli-like shape in the future. We also defined some interaction between the widgets. We started off with bacteria being able to “eat” other bacteria: when two bacteria were close enough, the bigger one would consume the smaller one, with the latter then becoming a circle in the bigger one’s surface area. We then later differentiated between bacteria and viruses, another step towards a more accurate (though obviously still simplified) simulation. Bacteria are now bigger and elliptical, while viruses are smaller circles. Viruses can be replicated by tapping on them, and we currently have not define a mechanism for creating new bacteria. Bacteria can become “infected” by a virus through interacting with it. The issue we ran into was the fact that viruses were still individual widgets even when within bacteria, which meant that tapping on a virus inside a bacterium would still create new viruses, and it was possible to move a virus outside a bacterium’s body. At the very end of the day, we decided to use the addChild() function in widgets, which successfully restricted the virus’s movement within the bacterium. Ideally, tomorrow we’ll work on disabling any interaction with the virus once it is within a bacterium.
6/4/2015: Day 4
Today was a big day with a lot of progress! First, we explored changing the rendering function of bacteria, so now when a bacterium becomes infected, rather than containing the virus widget itself, a little circle is drawn within its body (and the virus widget is removed from the screen). Adding instance variables to the widgets really extended the possibilities for interaction, so we decided that if an infected bacterium encounters a non-infected bacterium, the latter one would also become infected with the same colored virus (we currently have three different viruses: red, blue, and purple). We then restricted the widget’s movement so that neither bacteria nor viruses can be dragged off screen, something we’ve been trying to accomplish since yesterday. Once that was working, we expanded the app so that viruses and bacteria would now float freely within the “tank”, even when not being dragged by users. In the afternoon, we explored marker functionality, and defined any marker interaction with the screen to produce a new bacterium at that spot. The last successful change we made today was to make bacteria be able to reproduce: a bacterium now starts out small and grows continuously, until it reaches a size after which it divides and makes two new bacteria! At the very end of the day we started looking into having different bacteria and viruses bounce off of each other when they collide, but we ran into some issues, which would occasionally prevent them from moving at all and get interlocked. We’ll continue to look into that tomorrow.
6/5/2015: Day 5
Today we continued working on animating the widgets, but ran into the same issues when two widgets collide. We tried several different approaches and equations, but all of them seemed to have some borderline cases that would not display properly On a more successful note, we managed to get marker recognition working: we assigned different markers different roles. Tapping one kind of marker on the screen creates a new bacterium; tapping a bacterium with a specific marker display information about it, and tapping it with a different marker removes it from the tank. We also explored future customization, in terms of using custom images as the bacteria (instead of drawn shapes), but only tested it with a sample image. More works needs to be done in creating a customized bacteria image for the actual project. We will probably spent most of next week focusing on that, and on exploring more accurate SynBio concepts. Overall, it was a good first week!
6/8/2015: Day 6
Today was dedicated to learning Biology. Natalie Kulldel came to visit and gave us a basic Synbio 101, since most of the people in the lab (myself included) have a limited Bio background. Then we talked about some of the science behind previous iGEM projects, including Bacterial Photography, e-Chromi, and making bacteria smell like bananas! It was really fascinating to see just how much synthetic biology is like computer science, which also opens up a lot of possibilities for the direction in which to take our project. We also had a brainstorming session, talked about bacterial superpowers, and applications of Synbio research. At the end, we discussed the ethical implications and overcoming the distrust people might have regarding “engineered” organisms, in the context of the museum exhibit. Tomorrow we’re having a call with Anja and Romie from the Tech, so we are starting to develop concepts and preliminary designs for the actual project. One week in, we’re getting down to business!
6/9/2015: Day 7
We spent the better part of the day brainstorming ideas for the project. We started out with more general brainstorming, but by the early afternoon narrowed it down to three specific exhibit designs (Bac to Mars, BacFarm, and BacMan). They were all conceptually centered around letting users engineer bacteria to perform a particular task, given a list of tasks, but they had different “storylines” and engagement techniques. This is the very early stages of development, so we do expect all of these to change drastically, and possibly not even make an appearance in the final project we settle on. In the afternoon, we talked to Anja and Romie from the Tech, who gave us feedback on our ideas and designs, as well as provided us with more concrete information on what they expect out of the exhibit. As expected, our preliminary designs did not necessarily align with their thoughts, but we all shared the common theme of emphasising engineering and creative spirit in the exhibits. We will continue working on fine-tuning the ideas, and the rest of the week will probably be dedicated to exploring technical possibilities for getting the exhibit to work.
6/10/2015: Day 8
We are back to tinkering with Cornerstone. Since yesterday all of us agreed that it would be good if users had a tangible token they can carry around and put together while exploring the exhibit, we got started with looking into recognizing multiple markers activity on the MultiTaction screen. We also looked into optimizing the size of the markers, and trying to get them as small as possible (to minimize the size of the possible future token). We discovered that the smallest size the MultiTaction can reliably recognize for our purposes is 4x4cm, which should be small enough. In the afternoon, we started working on a new app (expanding on the one we made last week), to introduce a more varied range of interaction with the widgets, for example clicking on a widget to expand and display information about it. We also got some basic functionality in terms of widgets recognizing when they’re tapped on with three markers and changing their state appropriately. Overall, despite the slight frustration (and a lot of cutting out paper squares) of the morning, today was a successful day in terms of functionality and design. We’re really moving forward with your prototype!
6/11/2015: Day 9
Today was a productive day. We worked on different marker functionality, so that each combination of four markers tapped on a bacteria creates a distinct plasmid combination for that bacteria. We also made infoboxes, both on top of the screen (visible at all times), and next to the bacteria (when it’s pulled up close). We also spent some time talking about the physical token that could be part of the exhibit, thinking about how to make markers fit nicely with each other in a single device.
6/12/2015: Day 10
We spent the morning developing another application to explore simulating wetlab actions, such as dragging things into flasks and petri dishes. We decided to just stick with a basic “pick a fruit flavor and ‘extract’ that gene” metaphor that lets users choose one of four fruits into a flask, then drag the flask to a petri dish, which would display an overlay letting the user know what DNA piece they need to insert into the physical plasmid token to get that gene. Of course, this is still very abstract high-level functionality that is just with testing purposes, but it was also nice to see how much quicker we’re getting in using the surface and the Cornerstone API after a couple of weeks. In the afternoon, we had another call with Anja and Romie (before they come visit on Monday!), just to show them the couple of prototypes we’ve developed since Tuesday. Since we decided we’re in a good place in terms of working with the MultiTaction, we spent the rest of the day brainstorming more concrete ideas about the exhibit and getting a more realistic and fleshed-out prototype.
6/15/2015: Day 11
Today was a busy day! Anja and Romie from the Tech Museum are visiting us for two days, and we’re spending most of those two days brainstorming ideas for the project. We had a Scientific Ethics training in the morning as part of the Summer Research program, but after that we got to work. Romie and Anja gave a brief overview of the other museum exhibits and what they would expect of the exhibit we develop. In the afternoon, we spent a lot of time brainstorming ideas for the project. We focused on the “storylines” and the “environment” part. The name BacPack was born, and we decided that the general story behind the exhibit would be that the visitors are scientists engineering bacteria to help explorers on different missions. We decided on three extreme environments/new frontiers: Mars (everyone’s favorite), the Deep Sea, and the Antarctic. We also started looking into BioBricks we could use for the digital exhibit; we each picked a topic to research for homework tonight.
6/16/2015: Day 12
In the morning we presented the results of the research we did last night, and made a list of all the BioBricks that could be helpful. We then spent time researching and talking about the conditions and resources available in each environment, and made a list of their “haves” and “needs”. In the afternoon, we created a simplified paper prototype of what we envisioned the exhibit to look like. We went through several iterations of brainstorming and changing the design, until we settle on a design that would split a single MultiTaction screen into two parts, and would allow each user to have their personal “workbench” space as well as a testing environment. Tomorrow, we are going to develop a more detailed prototype and test it with children on Thursday.
6/17/2015: Day 13
Most, if not all, of today was spent making a paper prototype and refining our design from yesterday. We spent some time deciding on the layout of the workspace, as well as the representation of the bacteria, and after that it was pretty much just cutting things out and gluing them together. I look forward to testing it tomorrow!
6/18/2015: Day 14
We finished our paper prototype in the morning, and Orit’s children came to visit us in the afternoon. They’re aged 6 and 9, so they’re the exact age of our target audience. They seemed to enjoy playing around with the prototype and understood the concept behind the project. We asked them to assess the difficulty level, and they said that it’s not “too easy or too difficult”.
6/19/2015: Day 15
The NEGEM Meetup was today! We took the train to Boston bright and early, and got there with a bit of time to spare so we met some of the other teams. The presentations were very interesting, and it was great to hear what the other teams are doing. I didn’t really understand all of the science, since all the other teams are working with actual BioBricks, but it was still nice to see the more technical details and the foundation of what we’re building. The time we spent on socializing and talking about collaboration with the other teams was also very helpful, as were the feedback forms they gave us. A lot of the teams suggested we make the protocol and procedures used in a wet lab a more prominent part of the software, which is an important aspect to consider.
6/22/2015: Day 16
We started work on the computer prototype today! We did the basic layout of the program, using sample images. We based everything on the paper prototype from last week, so the workflow was easy. So far, it’s going easier than expected; we haven’t run into any significant coding challenges, but we also haven’t started work on any of the functionality, so we’ll see how tomorrow goes.
6/23/2015: Day 17
Today was another day dedicated to programming. We started adding functionality and worked on marker recognition.
6/24/2015: Day 18
We spent the morning adding more functionality to the prototype. In the afternoon, we introduced a major change to the layout: now the entire screen is dedicated to only one user, with the workbench and the environment each taking up half of the screen respectively.
6/25/2015: Day 19
We continued working on the functionality. We have been feeling a bit uncertain with the current layout of the design, so in the afternoon we talked to Johanna and Orit, and discussed possible changes to the layout. We spent some time brainstorming alternative versions, to emphasize collaboration and to allow multiple users to share the screen. This was to be expected; and iterative design process inherently has the potential for minor or major changes as we go along. We will start exploring new layouts, and we will also start talking to graphic designers about the images we would like to include as part of the design.
6/26/2015: Day 20
Today was another day of brainstorming. Mike Horn came to the lab, and we discussed museum exhibits and children’s interaction. We also looked at some of the project that he has been working on, in order to discuss more design ideas and get inspiration. In the afternoon, we “tested’ the prototype of a game he is working on, which was a lot of fun (we did get quite competitive). We spent more time finalizing layouts and talking about possible designs. It all seems kind of uncertain right now, but I’m sure we’ll be able to come up with a solid new design in no time--we just have to narrow our ideas a bit further.
6/29/2015: Day 21
We spent time talking about the ideas we’d developed last week and discussing how each one promotes collaboration and learning. We have a pretty solid agreement on the general layout of the screen, but we are still undecided on how to incorporate the Environment or Collaboration areas. We have discussed the values of having each space on the screen, and the likelihood that users will use it. We started on a simple paper prototype, which helped narrow down our ideas a bit.
6/30/2015: Day 22
We finished the paper prototype and then Stephanie Houde came to the lab to talk to us about our design. She is an interaction designer and a Wellesley alumna, so it was very nice talking to her. She gave us some very useful and concrete feedback on our prototype, so we are narrowing down our ideas even further. By the end of the day, we actually had a very solid and finalized version of it.
7/1/2015: Day 23
Today was another busy day. Natalie came to give us feedback on our latest iteration. We also had a conversation about aspects of the scientific process that we would like to include in the digital component without making the interaction too overwhelming, and how the wet lab component can complement that experience. We also met with Casey to talk about potential art and design for BacPack, including backgrounds, overall theme, and color choices. At the end of the day, we had a redesigned version of our paper prototype.
7/2/2015: Day 24
We did some more work with the paper prototype today. We tested it with several users from the research program who had never seen it before, and incorporated their feedback into the design. We also went through a set of design cards with requirements for interactive exhibits by age group, and we wrote up how our exhibit design satisfies each of the requirements.
7/3/2015: Day 25
We had the day off today because of the holiday tomorrow!
7/6/2015: Day 26
We started working on the computer prototype. We now have a very solid idea of what the software will look like, so it is much easier to program to that end. A lot of the programming also depends on the visuals and animations, so we only have the basic motions and functionality so far.
7/7/2015: Day 27
Today we continued working on the prototype and the phrasing write-up of all the prompts and information in the application. In the afternoon, Casey visited the lab again and brought some of the sketches and mock-ups of their initial design ideas. We discussed the artwork we’ll need, and agreed that some of the animation will be crucial for getting the functionality down, so Casey will begin working on that in the next few days.
7/8/2015: Day 28
As part of the Summer Research program at Wellesley, we have to give a presentation on the research we are doing. Our presentation is scheduled for tomorrow, so we spent most of today working on that. We started building off of the NEGEM presentation we gave, but changed it accordingly so that we spent more time explaining the basic science behind our project, since oru disciplinary group is the Computer Science, Math, Astronomy, and Physics, and no one has much biology in their background. It was good practice to make sure that we can convey the basic concepts, and it was a lot of fun making our presentation more engaging and animated (literally, we added a whole bunch of nice transitions and animations on the slides).
7/9/2015: Day 29
Our presentation was at lunch today, so we spent most of the morning finishing it up. The presentation went fine; people asked a few questions afterwards. In the afternoon, Casey sent us some more of the design work they’ve done, so we incorporated the flask animation and the new background into our design. It is starting to actually look good now. I’m excited to continue working on it next week, since tomorrow we are going to the Science Museum!
7/10/2015: Day 30
Today was so much fun! We went to the Science Museum early in the morning, and got tickets to the “Science behind Pixar” exhibit as well as the Ice Age 4D screening. The Pixar exhibit was so, so inspiring and entertaining; we all pretty much left determined to work at Pixar one day. We also looked at the fish exhibit, which was a partial inspiration in the early stages of our work, and which we’d read several papers about, but it was so much better to see it in person. There were many exhibits that had components similar to ours, so it was helpful to see how they are integrated with the rest of the design. Overall, it was a very fun and educational visit!
7/13/2015: Day 31
We spent most of the day working on the prototype. We added the new animations that Casey sent in, and most of the functionality has been laid down with the most recent changes.
7/14/2015: Day 32
We spent a large part of today figuring out the math for the animation and widget response. Since the entire background is one widget (both the workbench and the environment area), we needed to define when a flask is dragged into Mars (and at what point it happens). We used the distance from the center of the Environment semicircle, which was simple enough for the two horizontal widgets. However, the two widgets on the side are rotated, so it took a while to figure out how the coordinate system work and how to get a flask’s absolute coordinates on the screen (as opposed to its coordinates in relation to its parent widget). We did figure it out eventually though, so that felt satisfying!
7/15/2015: Day 33"
Wellesley_TheTech,2015,Team:Wellesley TheTech#Team#Notebooks_-_-_TEXT.html,"7/15/2015: Day 33
Today was another Math day! We spent most of the morning fixing the rotation of the flasks so that when they enter Mars, they’d turn to point towards its center (so that the bacteria exists towards it and not in some random direction). In the afternoon, the MIT App Inventor team came to visit us, and we had some time for demos and a presentation. We spent the rest of the time we had after that talking about the art we’ll need, and finalizing some of the designs we’ve been working on.
7/16/2015: Day 34
We got laser cutter training this morning! It was so much fun. We are probably going to be cutting out our tangibles next week (Casey’s been working on designing them), so it really feels like the project is coming together. Casey also sent us a lot of new animations and art, so we worked on incorporating those into our design.
7/17/2015: Day 35
Today was dedicated to getting ready for tomorrow’s collaboration meeting. The BU and MIT iGEM teams are coming to the lab on Saturday so that we can demo our prototype to them and run some user studies, and we are giving them feedback on their presentation and methods. We incorporated the image of a static status bar in the design, and added functionality that lets a group of bacteria appear on Mars when the flask empties. I hope tomorrow goes well!
7/20/2015: Day 36
Saturday was so much fun! We spent the morning testing our prototype and demoing other technology we have in the lab, and the BU and MIT teams gave us so much useful feedback. Hearing their presentations in the afternoon was also very interesting. Today, we are continuing working on the animation and the feel of the interface. We will be doing more user tests this week, so the prototype is really starting to come together.
7/21/2015: Day 37
We finished the functionality of the  status bar today! It now updates dynamically so that resource level decrease at random intervals, and when users send bacteria to Mars, the appropriate resource level increases. At this point, we have practically all of the functionality, but we need to continue working on the design for testing it tomorrow.
7/22/2015: Day 38
We tested the prototype with three of the Outreach program interns who are at the science center this summer. We had the opportunity to change some things before we test it with the students from Upward Bound tomorrow. We added more informational messages on the side, which will hopefully make the interaction easier.
7/23/2015: Day 39
Today we tested with the students from Upward Bound. There was a total of almost 50 students, so we got to test with 10 groups of 3-5 students each. It was very informative to observe such large groups interact with the surface. Overall, we found that we need more informational messages, and many people liked the idea of having instructional videos to incorporate into the design.
7/24/2015: Day 40
We’re almost there! We continued working on the functionality and incorporating features the test users suggested. We decided to make the information on the side a tabbed panel split into several categories so we can display more information.
7/27/2015: Day 41
We got a lot done today. Casey sent us a lot of new art over the weekend, so we incorporated that into our design. Now the plasmids are color-coded based on their outputs. We also made the bacteria on Mars cluster around the resources they are using. We fixed the duplication bug we were having, and added a glowing outline to the changing status bars.
Vivien's Notebook
6/1/2015: Day 1
Today was the first day and I feel so overwhelmed (in the best way) and excited to be introduced to all of these new CS softwares and applications of CS in education.  We began with a lab orientation, and then split off into our teams to begin brainstorming and training.
The iGEM team (Rachel, Sam, and I) started by researching iGEM medal requirements and gaining a deeper understanding of the iGEM competition.  We had already done some prior research about the iGEM competition and previous Wellesley iGEM teams’ projects, but getting familiar with iGEM requirements made me begin to more fully grasp the great effort and time that would be put into these projects- but also made me all the more excited to be pursuing them.
We downloaded the software that we would be using (Cornerstone SDK) and spent the rest of the day exploring the provided examples and examining the different ways we could interact with the Widgets.  I feel very excited and optimistic about the upcoming work.
6/2/2015: Day 2
Today we began work on our own example application!  We created our own basic “Hello World”-level app that featured rectangles, which upon tapping specific ones, would duplicate below where your finger touched the screen.  We started playing around with the shapes, and changed the rectangles to circles.  The signature for creating circles seemed to be very simple and similar to drawing rectangles, but by examining the different parameters that each method took in, we became introduced to new concepts such as Nimble Vector2fs.  As of now, we are trying to restrict the Widgets to the screen and prevent them from accidentally being pushed offscreen and becoming inaccessible.
6/3/2015: Day 3
After changing the Widget shapes to circles, we ultimately changed our main Widget shape to be an ellipse.  This choice made us start to consider other ways that we can apply basic concepts of synthetic biology to our project, so we decided to have two forms of Widgets-- large white “E. Coli” and smaller, more colorful widgets that represent viruses.  We hoped to display and share the concept of bacteria absorbing or “eating” a virus.  Currently in our app, if a E.Coli and virus intersect, the E. Coli “eats” the virus and the virus appears within the E.Coli to represent its infection.  When an infected E.Coli collides with a non-infected E.Coli, the second E.Coli displays the same virus to represent contamination.  When you tap a virus, three new viruses are created to simulate the virus growing on its own.  We are struggling with keeping the virus within the boundaries of the E.Coli parent widget, and working on inspecting the Widgets’ locations and reference points so that we can better understand how to work with them.
6/4/2015: Day 4
Today was a very successful day!  We added movement to the Widgets so that when left unattended, the E.Coli and viruses float about on their own.  The use of markers has also been incorporated, so that tapping a marker to the screen creates a new Bacteria.   In addition, we managed to set boundaries around the screen to prevent the Widgets from going out of frame.  Another exciting new addition is that the E.Coli now individually grow in size and once they reach a certain size, divide into two separate E.Coli.  If the original E.Coli was infected with a virus, the new E.Coli will also display its infection.  This process is accurate and true to the natural E.Coli growth and division process. Our next step is hopefully to keep the Widgets from overlapping and to eventually make them bounce off of one another upon intersection.
6/5/2015: Day 5
We have started programming specific actions for specific markers-- now, one marker creates a new Bacteria, one removes that specific Bacteria, and one displays the bacteria’s infection status with a simple attached textbox that states “Infected” or “Not infected”.  We have also introduced ImageWidgets into our app so that we can have custom images deployed onto our app.  We have only just started to realize the vast number of directions that this app/exhibit can go in and the many different concepts it can teach, and this textbox that will share the bacteria’s status is a great example of the different possibilities we can teach and display.   For our next steps, we want to program the widgets to bounce off of another, and eventually try introducing video and text to the screen that can play and display independently.
6/8/2015: Day 6
Today Natalie Kuldell stopped by the lab and led a few discussions about presenting and teaching synthetic biology as well as the complexities and controversies surrounding the topic. It was quite a wonderful experience-- I definitely admire a lot of the work Natalie has done- teaching and developing curriculum at multiple undergraduate institutes, founding BioBuilder Educational Foundation (a non-profit that teaches biology/synthetic biology topics online, making this knowledge widely available and accessible), working as a visiting scientist in labs… she clearly communicated her deep understanding of teaching and interacting with others and the greater implications and questions of synthetic biology.
We began our day with a short presentation by Natalie where she defined the study of synthetic biology and, upon learning that most of the team-members had more of a computer science background than biology background, began introducing these biological concepts as forms of coding.  She also explained the link between biology and engineering by passing out small educational kits comprised of mini-breadboards, wires, batteries, LED lights, and more where we could explore how biology functions to create its own “hardware”.  She then gave us a brief but very interesting lecture on the actual science behind how genes are expressed.  I understand that our exhibit will probably focus on the user being able to “make and tinker” than on the actual science, but it is still helpful for us to better understand what we may eventually represent and display.  I loved hearing Natalie teach-- she is very present and energetic.
We then went on to discuss some of the most famous synthetic biology experiments and previous iGEM submissions such as bacterial photography, E. chromi, Eau that Smell, Colorful World, etc.
Throughout the day, Natalie kept giving tips of what to keep in mind when designing a museum exhibit- such as taking into account the convenience of recovering/restoring materials (both accessibility and in monetary value), considering the attention span of the museum-goers, understandability (e.g. would a facilitator or written instructions be needed?), and how concrete or abstract the concepts that we would eventually teach would be.  Each point was definitely helpful, and something that I had not fully considered at that time.  This has been true during this summer research program thus far, as well as through previous years of experience-- but the more that I learn, the more I realize how little I actually understand in the world.  However, I only feel that much more energized and excited to fill in the gaps and pursue what I don’t know.  Today was a very full day-- we learned a lot of hard biology, we chatted about how museum-goers would experience our product, we discussed how to bring up this sensitive topic… I feel optimistic and ready to move forward tomorrow and the rest of the summer!
6/9/2015: Day 7
Today was an intense session of brainstorming.  We spent the morning coming up with three separate, very different possible museum exhibit ideas and designs to show Romie and Anja during our Skype call at 2:30.  Our current ideas are affectionately titled “BacMan”, “BacFarm”, and “Bac to Mars”, and I’m excited to pursue work on any of them!
During the call, they were both very pleasant and seem very committed to cultivating a creative space where museum-goers can learn in novel ways, and I’m definitely excited to work closer with them over the next few months.  We left the Skype call with the intention of beginning to pursue one of the ideas (probably the Mars exhibition, affectionately titled Bac to Mars) with the more specific technical goal of furthering our understanding of Cornerstone markers-- figuring out how to get the screen to recognize multiple and respond differently to a set.  By then, we were pretty worn out from a day of such brainstorming and creative thinking, so we spent the last hour helping transcribe interviews gathering information for another project happening in the HCI lab. I’m looking forward to coming in tomorrow and tackling markers.
6/10/2015: Day 8
We began the day with the goal of further exploring and understanding the Cornerstone Marker documentation.  We were able to program our app to detect and act if two markers touched the screen at the same time, but discovered that the app was inconsistent when identifying individual marker codes.  As the markers that the lab already had were a little worn out and folded on the corners, we decided to try printing out new markers and fiddle around to see the smallest marker that the app could still accurately detect.  Using the MarkerFactory application, we created, saved, and printed new markers of varying sizes to test against the app.
We created the smallest markers that could still be detected on the screen, and then began incorporating them into the app.
6/11/2015: Day 9
Today we simplified our code to match the “Bac to Mars” idea that we had shared with Romie and Anja.  Now, the starting screen appears with five bacteria with “empty” plasmids.  When you click on the bacteria, it increases in size and a text box appears with information about the bacteria.  Once you tap on the bacteria with four different markers, a new plasmid pops up of four different colors based on what markers you used to tap.  The text-box then pops up, listing the markers’ codes of the colors within the plasmid.
We also brainstormed possible plasmid token/physical representation ideas-- as of now, we are thinking of some large, donut-shaped object with spots for physical representations of different genes to fit in, like a puzzle.
We then hit a few dead ends in terms of technical stuff-- the screen sometimes has trouble recognizing the markers correctly/at all, which can be problematic in the future when the users are creating their customized plasmids.  In addition, we wanted to incorporate a TextEditWidget where a keyboard appears on screen and users are able to name their own bacteria, but for some reason the interface crashes upon inspection.  We sent a few questions to one of the Cornerstone engineers and are eagerly awaiting his response so we can proceed!
6/12/2015: Day 10
We had a very productive morning creating another possible interface, that allows users to choose the gene that they want to insert into their plasmid-- we began with a fun “flavor” example.  Users can drag a fruit representing their favorite flavor into a flask, which represents extracting a flavor-gene from the fruit and eventually showing it as a physical object that the user can place into their plasmid.
We then had a quick Google Hangout check-in with Romie and Anja to show them the two applications.  They seemed pleased, and I’m definitely excited to meet with them in person on Monday!
6/15/2015: Day 11
We began today with an ethics workshop where we discussed the fundamental guidelines and foundations of ethics in scientific experiments.  The lecture was mainly focused on plagiarism- its definition, its use with or without the intent to deceive, the amount of previous knowledge that people enter college/grad school with, and its consequences.  We also had a conversation about ownership, and it was just a very odd concept to me that upon submitting an article to a journal, the journal now owns those words and you cannot re-use your own words without asking for permission.  Overall, this was quite an interesting workshop-- all throughout elementary school and middle school I’ve heard “Don’t plagiarize!  Or else…” but I’ve never had a very full understanding of what fits into that definition and the possible repercussions.  It was definitely a useful time.
We then had a large, collaborative brainstorming and sharing session with Romie and Anja.  Both the Wellesley-side and The Tech-side shared our available resources-- we introduced them to the educational tools and technology we have in the HCI lab, and they shared the current and future exhibits that they are working on as well as the technology that are available alongside those exhibits.  It was very exciting to see what The Tech is working on and the educational concepts that they want to teach, and there were definitely moments where they shared hopeful ideas (such as representing bacterial growth and development) and I thought, “We can definitely program that!”  I’m glad that we had the first two weeks to tinker around and further understand Cornerstone.
Tonight, we’ve all been assigned to find possible biobricks that can be applied in our project from the Registry of Standard Biological Parts. Finding these biobricks requires going through previous iGEM projects which is absolutely fascinating-- I’m so amazed at the incredible creativity and scientific ability of some of the teams!  Looking forward to returning to the lab tomorrow to share my findings and hear about what others discovered.
6/16/2015: Day 12
This morning we all shared the individual research we had done last evening and took inventory of all of the biobricks we had discovered.  Afterwards, we continued to brainstorm and flesh out possible ideas. We finalized Mars, Deep Sea (Cave), and Antarctica as locations for our users to explore, and then moved on to brainstorm possible storylines and discuss what expectations the users approach the exhibit with.  I am learning that there are so many other things to consider and discuss outside of just the software/back-end-- we’re doing so much more than just coding, which I’m glad about- I love this design and brainstorming bit and I want to learn more about what has to go about for an entire exhibit to come together.
Now set in the storyline of creating bacteria that can help the user survive Mars, the deep sea, and Antarctica, we began furthering our ideas of the actual interface on a MultiTaction.  Romie and Anja presented us with a paper prototype they had used for a separate museum exhibit to give us an idea of the look and function of a paper prototype.  We then started created our own paper prototypes-- we sat on the ground, crowded around a single piece of paper, discussing and sketching, and the entire time I just felt my heart was rising up in excitement.  I’m very interested in education and teaching STEM subjects from a young age, and creating an interface introducing synthetic biology that is tailored to be accessible and understandable for young children merges all of these dreams.  The experience was even better because I was around really passionate, intelligent, down-to-earth people all just as committed to making this project the best it could be.
From now until Friday, our team has to actually create a paper prototype, test it on some young children (probably Orit’s kids!), start actually programming the back-end, and come up with a presentation to share our project at the iGEM meetup this Friday.  Wow.  This all sounds like a lot, but I am also thinking of previous times/projects where it seemed like I could not possibly get everything done and it all worked out-- and now, I am working with a very dedicated and lovely team, so I know we will work it out.  I plan on going to bed early tonight and coming in fresh and rejuvenated tomorrow morning!
6/17/2015: Day 13
Today we focused on creating our paper prototyping.  Even though right now, it doesn’t look like much, actually creating the prototype initiated a lot of conversations and discussions.  We had to chat about many aspects of how our application would run that we hadn’t considered before.  It was my first experience creating a paper prototype, and I really enjoyed it!  Looking forward to introducing it to Orit’s kids tomorrow.
6/18/2015: Day 14
Today was a busy day!  We worked all morning on finishing up our prototype to show Orit’s kids Ben and Daniel.  Once they came in, we ran through a couple of test scenarios on paper.
They were both very engaged and interested in the prototype, and also had some great feedback and ideas, including incorporating videoclips onto the screen and making the “Challenges” more difficult.  We will definitely incorporate some of these into our project!  It was very exciting to see people actually interact with what we had made so far-- I couldn’t wait to hear their feedback and see how they responded.
6/19/2015: Day 15
Today's NEGEM meet up went (surprisingly) well!  Our presentations were very well received by the other iGEM teams-- we definitely stood out as a team competing on the community lab track and thus focusing on making synthetic biology more accessible and educating others about general synbio concepts rather than actually doing the science.  A majority of the other undergrads participating in iGEM are studying a form of biology-- synthetic biology, computational biology, biochemistry-- which made me a little nervous about presenting our project, but people were actually very interested and curious about our software and the technology we were using.
Later in the day there was an hour allotted for all attendees to discuss their current progress, next steps, and possible collaborations in a smaller group.  There (and in our evaluation forms!) we got some excellent feedback for making the science more accurate.  I especially enjoyed chatting with some members from the MIT and BU iGEM teams who made suggestions on certain key aspects of the scientific process to include in our program.  I have so much respect for these students who are so learned in synthetic biology and spoke to us with so much patience and willingness to help.
Traci Haddock brought up a very good point that we are in Boston, the hub of synthetic biology-- besides just doing our user testings on young kids to see how they respond, we should also reach out to some experts in the field to gauge how accurate the science is, how well they think that process is portrayed, etc.  I think that the HCI lab has many possible contacts who would be happy to help out, from trained professionals to members of other iGEM teams!
Overall, today was really wonderful! Looking forward to incorporating some of these ideas on Monday!
6/22/2015: Day 16
Today we began programming the basic layout of the widgets and planning everything out in the most effective way.  As we begin today, I understand the true importance of making a paper prototype before actually programming so we can all be on the same page of how features will work and the software’s layout.
6/23/2015: Day 17
Today we finalized the basic layout and made certain features (such as the scanner) functional, but the software is still having trouble with marker recognition.  We reprinted out markers and attached them to new vessels with which to use them, but it’s still a bit funky.  We’ll come back and try again tomorrow!
6/24/2015: Day 18
We finished most of the basic functionality today.  In the afternoon, we were informed that due to the way that the MultiTaction screens are set up at The Tech, we cannot use the set up that we had had of two “scenes” on one screen.  We began re-designing, and continued on functionality.
6/25/2015: Day 19
Today, we checked in with Orit and discussed our next few steps- we’ve been working on functionality, but now we are beginning to see more of a need for an alternative design that is more collaboration-focused.  We continued to brainstorm possible designs.
6/26/2015: Day 20
We spent the morning going over our designs and listening pros and cons of each, and then after lunch we met Mike Horn, an assistant professor at Northwestern and the director of Northwestern’s TIDAL (Tangible Interaction Design and Learning) lab.  He showed us some of the projects that TIDAL is working on and it was so incredibly exciting to see the ways his lab applies computational thinking and computer science to education.  He also shared some helpful literature with us, including Thomas Humphrey’s Fostering Active Prolonged Engagement, which was very interesting to read and very applicable to what we’re working on.  Today was such an exciting day.
6/29/2015: Day 21
We devoted all of today to brainstorming and creating a new paper prototype!  A busy day.
6/30/2015: Day 22
Today we finished the paper prototype and chatted with Stephanie Houde, a Wellesley grad with a lot of graphic design experience.  She shared a lot of tips, including taking photos of each step and how to consider animations that inform the user how to proceed, including exaggeration and “amping up” to introduce movement/animation about to occur.
7/1/2015: Day 23
What a big day!  Natalie stopped by to see how we were doing.  It had been a month since we’d seen her, so obviously things had progressed quite a bit- since then, we had (for the most part) finalized our concept, goals to teach, design layout, and paper prototype.  She gave a lot of helpful feedback, especially on the actual scientific accuracy.  We had an interesting conversation about what aspects of the scientific process we would have in the software side (without being too complex and confusing for users!) and what we would have in the actual wetlab component.
We also looked at possible artistic designs with Casey.  It was great to walk through the paper prototype with them since they have had so much experience with iGEM.  It’s exciting to know that actual designs are on their way!
Finally after Natalie and Casey’s feedback, we had a new version of our paper prototype!  We created a video for Romie and Anja to keep us updated.
The lab had a few other new people today as well-- two high school interns arrived today!  Since both have had some C++ experience,  over the next few weeks they’ll be playing around with Cornerstone as well and creating their own apps.
7/2/2015: Day 24
Today we examined the suggestions given by the lab’s design cards and jotted down how our project fulfills each requirement.  We also created a document to note our official phrasing and write-ups for the prototype/project.  Finally, we conducted a few user studies with some other Wellesley students who had little background knowledge of how we’d prepared the
Tomorrow we’ll work on: finalize among us phrasing and consider design possibilities
7/6/2015: Day 25
We’re continuing to work towards fulfilling basic functionality of our software, and planning a meetup with the BU and MIT iGEM teams!  I’m so excited for the chance to meet with two other teams and to share ideas and feedback.  Tomorrow we’ll be meeting with Casey, a recent Wellesley grad who has participated in many previous iGEM competitions, to discuss artwork and designs for the final project!
7/7/2015: Day 26
Today, Casey came in and showed us their notebook and concept art thus far-- everything looks so incredible, and having a lot of potential!  It’s very helpful that they’re familiar with iGEM and designing for clients, but they also have a great designer’s eye and are so artistic.
7/8/2015: Day 27
Today we continued to work on our presentation, and work on adding functionality & incorporating.
7/9/2015: Day 28
Today we gave our presentation at the student talks-- it overall went very well!  People were definitely very interested in actually getting to know what projects we are working on in the lab and it was exciting on our end to be able to share how the project has changed over various iterations of brainstorming, designing, and redesigning.  Preparing for this presentation has also been a great opportunity to put into words the process and ideas and concepts that we’ve been using this summer, which will come in handy for our actual iGEM presentation and for writing future articles and such.
7/10/2015: Day 29
Our lab took the day off to visit the Museum of Science’s special exhibit on Pixar!  It was an incredible experience and an opportunity to see the incredible amount of math and physics that goes on behind the scenes to add lights, flesh out characters, design a set, and create the world in a Pixar film.
7/13/2015: Day 30
Today we continued to incorporate Casey’s artwork into our project-- the beautifully designed pieces add so much to our program experience!  We also worked on our project description, looked into more iGEM requirements, and discussed possibly meeting with Wellesley’s science center machinist, Larry, to work with the laser cutter to create our tangibles!
7/14/2015: Day 31
We’re still working on the functionality -- today we specifically looked at the tracking of coordinates and math to tell the flasks when they’re “on Mars”.  We determined the background image’s points, at what coordinates Mars began, ended, and the length of its radius.  We then checked the points of the flasks, and calculated the distance of the flask from Mars’ “midpoint”-- if its distance was less than the length of Mars’ radius, we programmed the animation to display deploying the bacteria to Mars.   This ended up being trickier than expected because the Widgets displaying the petri dishes on the two sides are rotated, and thus their X and Y values are flipped.  Furthermore, each Widget is a child Widget of a larger Widget, and their coordinates are relative to their Parent Widget.  Figuring out the absolute locations of the Widgets and thus calculating their distances took some time, but we finally got it!
7/15/2015: Day 32
Today we built off of the victory of yesterday and programmed the flasks to rotate in the direction of Mars’ center to create the illusion that the flasks deploy the bacteria onto Mars.  We checked in with our PI, sent out an updated list of designs and artistic things needed to Casey, and scheduled a meeting with Larry to receive laser cutter training.  Then, the HCI lab met with the MIT App Inventor team and showed them some demos of the research we were working on.  It was very exciting to meet everyone on the team and learn about their very cool work (and some of their ties with iGEM!)
7/16/2015: Day 33
This morning we had our training with Larry on laser cutting basics-- it was so exciting to be in the machine shop and see all of the machinery at work.  We made a simple “Hello World”-esque plaque for Johanna, and explored the other things and opportunities in the shop!  Casey also sent us a lot of beautiful artwork and designs that we incorporated-- very exciting :)
7/17/2015: Day 34
Today we’ve been doing our best to pull everything together and have the best possible prototype for when the BU and MIT iGEM teams come visit us tomorrow!  We’re also discussing next steps to take!
7/20/2015: Day 35
Today we reflected on how the BU/MIT iGEM teams’ comments and made some adjustments to our project accordingly.  In particular, people wanted specific instructions at every step of the process, so we created “bubble instructions” and contact Casey to ask for a template of message images and icons.  We also continued to look into creating the tangibles, including contacting Larry about materials and googling pros and cons of different materials and where to order them from.
7/21/2015: Day 36
Today we continued discussing how to obtain different materials with Larry, added status bar functionality, and generally prepped for prototyping-- tomorrow, three high school interns will be coming to our lab to try out the project.  I am very excited to see how people interact with it and how they feel, especially since I couldn’t attend the BU/MIT meet up!
In the afternoon, Lauren, Lily and I headed over to the Museum of Science for their Building with Biology Event training.  Building with Biology is an event for scientists and the public to have open conversations about the synthetic biology field and its applications, and clear up public misconceptions.  It’s exciting to be helping out at this event and continue working on public perceptions of synthetic biology.  There are a lot of prominent synthetic biologists presenting at the event, including Natalie Kuldell!
7/22/2015: Day 37
Casey sent us the art for message templates-- a way for us to communicate with the user what their next step is!  We created the bubble-like messages and added them to the screen, we feel excited and ready to be testing with some high school interns at noon!
When the interns came in to play around with our exhibit, they were definitely excited by the premise and platform of the project-- they liked making different combinations of genes, but without the animation of the plasmid entering the bacteria they found it difficult to understand the actual scientific process that the tangibles represented.  Will be making changes to make this process more transparent.
7/23/2015: Day 38
We spent this morning focused on debugging, and figured out how to make the marker recognition more consistent and reliable.
Today was a big day in terms of user testing-- the MIT/Wellesley Upward Bound program of fifty high school students visited our lab and interacted with our prototype in groups of four or five.  It was a wonderful experience-- it was very helpful to see how people first approached the exhibit and what questions they had along the way.  We learned that we definitely need more explicit instructions and labeling of items on the screen, and also discovered a bunch of new bugs that had never showed up before!
With learning all of this new information and finishing the last week before the poster session and when we leave, we are realizing how much work there still is!  It’s really crunch time: we listed everything left to do and divided it over the last days of work.  We’re ready to come in tomorrow fresh and ready to redesign.
7/24/2015: Day 39
Hello!  This is crunch week, and we’re ready to go.  Today we finished our research abstracts- a general one, and one targeted for a more scientific audience-- both of which are required as part of our summer spent doing research at Wellesley.  We also have decided to incorporate videos into our exhibit, and so we’ve asked the interns to find some informational and educational videos about synthetic biology and the cell duplication process.
We also confirmed an appointment with Larry to go down to the machinery and cut the tangibles out.  Our materials arrived, and we’re looking forward to meeting with Larry to cut next Wednesday!
In the afternoon, we updated the “reset” functionality so that the petri dishes fully reset when the user clicks the “Reset” button-- previous there were some bugs that included the bacteria and other buttons still appearing when they should have been removed from the screen.
7/27/2015: Day 40
Over the weekend, Casey sent us some beautiful art files.  When we came in today, we immediately updated everything that they had sent us-- their art makes our work look so much better and makes the exhibit so much easier to understand!  For example, they’ve sent us a glowing flask and animations of a plasmid entering a bacteria, which greatly help users understand how to proceed and what their actions are representing.  Other art changes include a glowing animation around status bars which draws attention to the change due to the user’s work.  We also finished the logic for programming the bacteria to go to a certain part of Mars depending on their “Have” or “If”, and fixed a bug that was displaying the wrong animation at certain points.  Looking forward to continuing to work tomorrow!
7/28/2015: Day 41
We stayed late today to finish our exhibit!!! Yay!!!  This included creating and adding information messages, sending Larry our tangible files to prepare for laser cutting tomorrow (!), researching and adding additional scientific background for each gene, incorporating the rest of Casey’s animations, making editing when the status bars flicker, and adding videos to the project.  I love how it looks, and I’m so proud of how far this exhibit has come.
7/29/2015: Day 42
This morning we met with Larry to laser cut our tangibles!  It was such an exciting process to see them being made and have the physical parts present.  We created a video of the current prototype for Romie and Anja, and then focused most of our day on building our poster.  It is very visual and colorful, and I love it!
7/30/2015: Day 43
Today was poster session day!! We started the day off by printing our beautiful poster and finishing up details with the tangibles, practiced our presentations, and went down to the science library to present!
I felt very excited and proud to show what we had worked so hard on to create.  The Multitaction itself drew many interested attendees, and we were swamped with people asking questions and asking to test it out.  The best part was having some younger attendees (probably age 7 - 9) playing with it-- they were enthralled!  They kept making different combinations of genes and trying to provide resources to Mars to fill the resource status bars.  Most of our prototype testing had been with an older audience, so it was very relieving and exciting to see how captivated the younger audience was.
Christina's Notebook
Brainstorming with Romie and Anja
Today Romie and Anja came to help us brainstorm ideas for our iGEM project. All of us worked together to come up with ideas that would be able to be converted into a museum exhibit. The energy in the lab was truly amazing and we all really gave all that we had. It was one of the precious times in the lab where everyone was working together on the exact same thing and was 100% focused. We also turned all the lab walls into brainstorming space, sticking post-its with ideas on the walls and writing around them to group them together. It was also very interesting to see what other people were coming up with. It also felt like coming up with science fiction ideas that could be made into reality. My favorite things being mentioned involved changing elements in food to make them better and easier for consumption.
NEGEM
Today was the New England GEM meeting (NEGEM). All teams from the New England area came together at Boston University, where we all presented our ideas for what our iGEM project would be. The atmosphere in the room was amazing and it was really interesting to see what other teams were working on. It was also very informative since I was coming from a computer science perspective when everyone else was on syn-bio track. It was also a very good way to get feedback from other teams on our ideas and our progress. We also were able to find teams to collaborate with, which will be very useful for our progress. In general, it was a great experience and very educational one. I am looking forward to more meetings until the competition and our collaboration with the BU and MIT teams.
BU/MIT Meetup
Today we came into the lab on a Saturday to meet up with the BU and MIT teams to show them our work and to view theirs. It all had a really good time and it was very useful to receive feedback for our project. Both of the other teams are on the syn-bio track so they had very different projects than the one we are working on. In addition, the feedback that we got was unique since it was coming from a completely different perspective. I also really appreciated the atmosphere in the lab where people from different backgrounds got to play around with all the different gadgets that we have. In general, I think that it was a great experience for all parties involved and that we all got very informative feedback that we integrated into our projects.
Jasmine's Notebook
Brainstorming with Romie and Anja
Prior to today the lab had tossed around some general ideas as to what our iGem project was going to be, but Romi and Anja's visit marks our first real brainstorming session. Since we're creating an interactive exhibit for The Tech Museum of Innovation in California, it's important that we got a chance to speak to both of them since they will be the exhibit's curators. This brainstorming session was one of the few times everyone in the lab was together working on the same project. As a group we managed to come up with and finalize a direction to take our project in. I'm really looking forward to our final project and think museum visitors will be enticed to give it a go!
NEGEM
I was able to attend NEGEM, a meetup of all the iGem teams in the New England area, last year and was looking forward to going again this year. It was fun seeing the new faces and hearing about the projects local teams have decided to tackle. NEGEM is held at Boston University. In addition to having lunch together, all the teams in attendance are given 20 minutes to present and receive feedback on their projects. Wellesley brought in the only team that didn't have any biology or chemistry major members, but despite that we were able to give some solid feedback on the other presentations. In addition to getting good feedback on our own iGem project, we were also able to find collaborators (Boston University and MIT). Once everyone has had a time to come back together and reflect on what was said during NEGEM, we'll start setting up a day to meet with BU and MIT later in the summer.
BU/MIT Team Meet Up at Wellesley
We don't normally have to come into the lab on Saturdays, but today it was necessary so we could meet up with BU and MIT. We started the day with tours of the HCI Lab and Wellesley's Science Center and then got to business listening to short presentations everyone had prepared. Since there are no biologists in the HCI lab, presenting to us was a good opportunity for the BU and MIT teams to check if their presentations and projects were understandable to a less knowledgeable audience. Similarly, the Wellesley team got a chance to see if our interactive exhibit and digital interpretation of synthetic biology stayed true to its roots. I think everyone came away from this meetup with some important things to think about (one of the things we have to look at is making interactions more intuitive) and look forward to seeing what comes of it.
Lily's Notebook
NEGEM
We headed to Boston University today for our first official NEGEM meeting. I will admit it was a little nerve racking to be in a room full of biology-focused science students, after all that is what the iGEM competition is about. It was a bit intimidating hearing a lot of the presentations before us because of our lab’s computer science background and limited exposure to biology prior to this summer. However the twenty minute Q&A helped with understand much more than I want to admit.I thought that because we were doing the “community track” we wouldn’t have anything to contribute to these other students. After we presented our project I felt so much more at ease. People came up to us and asked questions and seemed to be genuinely interested in what we were doing. A lot of people commended us on doing something different and thought it was really cool. After all the presentations and question periods, we broke into groups to discuss these worksheets to help us engage each other about our opinions and research and it was really nice hearing from so many different people and their different lab experiences across universities.
BU/MIT meetup
Today we had the Boston University and MIT’s iGEM teams come to our lab today to collaborate and share our iGEM presentations and work. I had a lot of fun getting to know the students from other schools. We got to use them as test subjects or rather perform user studies on them as they tried our our iGEM multi-touch program and also helped test other projects going on in the lab. This meetup was our lab’s first time showing it and having our project tested so it was a little bit like a milestones in our progress. We got some great feedback on ways to improve, likes and dislikes of the projects. It was great to get insight on different types  It was extremely valuable to have the time to get to know our peers in this competition as competitors and on a personal level. We got down to business the first half of the day, full of presenting our respective power points and brainstorming ways for each other’s team to enhance their research and asking questions. Our lunch break was my favorite part of the day because we played Catch-a-phrase, and I guess when you have a bunch of driven college students in one room it can get a little crazy. It was competitive and fun and really helped us get to know the other teams.
Upward Bound Testing
Today was a hectic day in the lab. We had the pleasure of hosting the Upward bound group to at the lab for a few hours.  Getting to show people all the awesome things in the lab is always fun so it was especially great to be able to share that experience with high school students who were excited to learn more about our lab. Everyone in the lab was in charge of a different “station”, and I got to work with the Leap Motion. In addition to technology like the Leap Motion and Oculus, it was great for these students to see the Multi-touch device and fiddle around with our iGEM prototype which was very helpful to see how a removed party interacted with it. The lab was buzzing with questions and my fellow co-workers explaining their various technology they were stationed at. Even though we all were pretty winded after standing up for a few hours straight opposed to working around the multi-touch and noses buried in computers, it was a blast and a great change of pace.
Melissa's Notebook
Today was my first day working in the Wellesley HCI lab. This summer I am working with the iGEM team on their competition project. From what I can understand they are working on creating a program that will teach synthetic biology concepts to children through a multitaction cell. As of today, the design is in its planning stages. However, we are getting close to what will be the final design, which is very exciting! I am looking forward to spending the summer working with Sam, Vivien, and Rachel. I hope to learn as much as I can from them. Hopefully they can help me with learning some coding skills over the course of my time here at Wellesley. I can already tell this will be a great summer with the enthusiasm and positive energy that I felt in the lab today."
Wellesley_TheTech,2015,Team:Wellesley TheTech#Team#Notebooks_-_-_TEXT.html,"Today the upward bound kids came to help us test run our prototype. Upward Bound is a summer program that 9-12 grade students take part in on Wellesley's campus. It was interesting to see how they interacted with our prototype. I saw the full range of what someone felt coming up to the multitaction. Some were hesitant to touch it at first while others were excited to run up and start playing. This also helped is with the design process of our prototype. Without this user test, we would not have found some flaws that occurred within our program. For example, a few of the users suggested after interacting with the program that it might be more helpful if there were some more written instructions for them to read as they went along creating their bacteria. Another huge part that they helped us with was allowing us to see how different users worked with the tangibles that we provided them with. Some were not sure what at all to do with them, while others got it right away and were able to get the relation that we tried to convey through the common images on the screen. From that observation, it allowed us to know to add a statement in the instructions for the user on the screen about the tangible element. Currently, our tangibles are still cardboard cutouts. However, shortly we will be laser cutting acrylic to make new tangibles for the final product which is very exciting. But, that also means that things are starting to wrap up for the summer which means that we are so close to what will be the final version of our program.
Today was my last day here in the HCI lab for the summer. Looking back, I realize just how much I learned. Besides gaining some coding languages and skills, I learned a lot about the human component of programming. I learned that you need to think about how someone would try to interact with your program with no knowledge of what to do. As I finish this summer my main goal is to keep learning more coding languages. Also, I am looking forward to rejoining the team in September for the competition. I am excited and thankful to be able to experience this unique opportunity. This summer, the HCI lab and the iGEM team helped to give me a look into what is possible in the computer sciences and what I could do going into the future. I now have a slightly more concentrated view of what I want to do in college and possibly as a profession. Overall, this summer was one never to forget.
Nicole's Notebook
Tuesday, 6/30 -
Today was my first day at Wellesley College. The other interns and I first went to the large open area in the science building to talk about our internship requirements and other housekeeping information. Soon after we arrived our mentors joined us and took us back to the labs for a brief tour. My mentors Sam and Christina showed me the HCI lab and gave me an introduction to the projects the lab was working on. I learned about the PGHCI project and the iGEM project.
Tuesday, 7/7 -
I started working on learning Javascript and html using Codecademy. Also, I helped the PGHCI team by giving them input on how I would organize certain health conditions into categories. This helped the team decide how to sort the diseases and conditions to make it easier for users to understand their genomic information.
Tuesday, 7/21-
I continued to work on learning Javascript on Codecademy. I later helped the iGEM team research biobricks to use in their project, which was creating an interactive museum exhibit to help non-expert museum patrons understand synthetic biology concepts. The biobricks we researched were ones which could be used in bacteria on mars to create a more hospitable environment for human explorers.
Priyanka's Notebook
Throughout the month of July, I worked with the iGEM team and the other two interns, Nicole and Melissa, on the BacPack for New Frontiers project, an interactive display in which bacteria use available resources in extreme environments to make products important for human survival in those areas. For example, on Mars, resources include carbon dioxide, solar energy, soil, ice, and waste, which can be used to make oxygen, water, food, heat, and fuel. One of the tasks that we completed make the project easier to understand for younger students, we came up with simplified definitions for each resource and its use. In addition, we researched basic concepts related to the project such as the definitions of genes, bacterial reproduction, and bacterial colonies.
The third week, some interns from other labs came and tried the interactive display, and we observed them. Their feedback was useful in figuring out which aspects of the project can be improved upon, so that the display is more user-friendly. In addition, in order to explain synthetic biology, we helped add a video with subtitles to the display.
Throughout our time at the HCI lab, we learned JavaScript so that we could understand the code behind the project better. We also experimented with various virtual reality tools, so that we could learn about the kinds of feats that the HCI field can accomplish."

Attributions
Each team must clearly attribute work done by the student team members on this page. The team must distinguish work done by the students from work done by others, including the host labs, advisors, instructors, and individuals not on the team roster.
Can we base our project on a previous one?
Yes! You can have a project based on a previous team, or based on someone else's idea, as long as you state this fact very clearly and give credit for the original project.
Why is this page needed?
The Attribution requirement helps the judges know what you did yourselves and what you had help with. We don't mind if you get help with difficult or complex techniques, but you must report what work your team did and what work was done by others.
For example, you might choose to work with an animal model during your project. Working with animals requires getting a license and applying far in advance to conduct certain experiments in many countries. This is difficult to achieve during the course of a summer, but much easier if you can work with a postdoc or PI who has the right licenses.

During the time of our project, we got a lot of attention from local press and other media channels. This was quite an important part of publical outreach - we are the first team to come from Lithuania, so we wanted to trigger more curiousity about iGEM competition and synthetic biology in general. We could not thank more for OMConsulting for their invaluable help to reach out to information channels.

Meetup with SDU team
iGEM competition is not only about science. Communication between young and promising scientists is undeniably one the most important parts of iGEM. Just as we started our project, we decided that it is really important to form collaborative connections with other iGEM teams in order to integrate our own team into iGEM community and advance the integration of Lithuanian scientists into worldwide scientific community as well.
We got the chance to fulfill our expectations pretty soon. On June 1st – 3rd, 2015, we hosted a meetup with a SDU iGEM team from University of Southern Denmark. It was a great opportunity to meet other iGEMers.
SDU and Vilnius iGEM teams during lectures at the Institute of Biotechnology.
SDU team already have participated in iGEM competition for 5 times, so they have a lot of background knowledge and experience to share with the first-timers such as we are. They were the first ones to propose a meeting between teams, so we gladly accepted and listened to all the advices they gave us.
On the first day we presented each other our iGEM project ideas and discussed their importance, methods, application and other aspects. SDU iGEM team helped us a lot to gain a better insight on how to start and make a succesful iGEM project. They made a presentation on wiki creation and style, also a presentation on what is iGEM competition in general and what requirements we should not forget. All this information was not only helpful, but interesting as well and out of this meetup Vilnius iGEM team obtained tons of experience.
During the tour.
On the second day both teams had a visit to a local Thermo Fisher Scientific, where scientists presented their work and achievements and told us a little bit of history of this exact company, how it came to be and how it evolved from Fermentas in Lithuania. After that, we had several lectures on different topics: it was mainly related with the researches made here, in Lithuania. It was really interesting to listen how normal scientific research at the Institute of Biotechnology is made.
During the last day we visited the old town of our capital Vilnius and the main historical and cultural sites. We hope that SDU team enjoyed our meeting as much as we did and learned interesting and useful facts as well.
Big thanks goes to:
SDU iGEM team – for coming!
Giedrius Gasiūnas for a lecture about CRISPR/Cas system and its application.
Aleksandras Osipenko for a lecture about modular proteins and nucleic acid technologies.
Robertas Galinis for a lecture about microfluidics.
ThermoFisher Scientific for a guided tour around the laboratories.

The team was initiated by Dainius Tautvaišas, who participated in 2013 iGEM competition with Edinburgh University. Along with the first member Ingrida, they recruited the final team. So now there are seven students of genetics, molecular biology and biochemistry.
We are happy to have Prof. Dr. Virginijus Šikšnys as our team instructor and mentor along with Dainius. Also we cannot thank more to Prof. Dr. Šikšnys for the opportunity to realize our project at the Institute of Biotechnology.
Student members
Barbora Bajorinaitė
Third year Genetics
I am a third year genetics student and therefore youngest member of the team. Right now I am just starting to work in a lab, so iGEM means a lot of new experiences and having fun while learning.
Danielius Dvareckas
Bachelor of Biochemistry
As a biochemistry student who loves programming as a hobby iGEM is a great opportunity to learn new skills while working on an inspiring project! As you might have guessed, I am responsible for our team’s wiki. My motto is  „Improve and move forward“. iGEM is a wonderful addition to the never ending learning cycle that quenches my thirst for knowledge.
Ieva Rauluševičiūtė
Final year Genetics
For me being a member of the Vilnius iGEM team is an opportunity to create something our own, to make a project from scratch. My passion is finding out and trying new things, so this competition is perfect to me. I don’t only work in the laboratory, but also coordinate our team’s social networking, seek sponsorship and make sure the team and our project engages the public.
Ieva Savickytė
Final year Genetics
I like new things and approaches, which is the reason why iGEM is very appealing. It gives me an opportunity not only to be a part of a scientific project, but also develop organizational skills, meet students and researchers from all over the world. Besides science, I am interested in literature, history, sailing and traveling.
Ingrida Olendraitė
Bachelor of Molecular Biology
Having a dimple in my cheek is what I need the most for iGEM. I coordinate all the outreach activities we do and present our ideas to the public, therefore my smile with dimples is what helps the most. People love them and as much as I love smiling. Aside from meetings and presentations, I work to secure funding and also work in the laboratory. Next year will be challenging for me, because I will move to London to study Genetics of Human Diseases at UCL.
Mykolas Bendorius
Bachelor of Molecular Biology
I joined the competition because it gives our team the opportunity to develop some crazy ideas that are just our own. In the team my main responsibility is the scientific part – experiment planning and development. I am very happy to be a part of the team and I am very excited about our project! This year is the last when I can participate as a Vilnius iGEM member, because I was accepted to study biosciences at École Normale Supérieure in Lyon, France.
Šarūnas Tumas
Bachelor of Biochemistry
Together with Mykolas I coordinate and plan lab work. iGEM is a great opportunity to learn how to control all the project. People say, that I have good critical thinking, so it is an encouragement to make sure all things go according to plan. This year I will start Masters studies of Biochemistry at the University of Copenhagen.
Instructors
Dainius Tautvaišas
Main instructor / MSc Synthetic Biology and Biotechnology
Ever since participating in iGEM in 2013 as a student, I had been waiting for a Lithuanian team to participate, given our country’s large biotech industry and strong interdisciplinary student base. This year I took matters into my own hands and assembled the first team in the Baltic States – Vilnius iGEM! I provide the team with ample advice about the competition and synthetic biology frontiers. This year I am starting my PhD in Regenerative Medicine at Edinburgh University – using Synthetic Biology approaches to treat human diabetes!
Virginijus Šikšnys
Principal investigator
I like the enthusiasm and dedication of the Vilnius-iGEM team. It started as a grassroots movement and quickly developed into an excellent team. Students learned quickly how to generate ideas, communicate and raise funding. I believe they started the iGEM generation in Lithuania. I wish I was a student again.

Meetup with SDU team
iGEM competition is not only about science. Communication between young and promising scientists is undeniably one the most important parts of iGEM. Just as we started our project, we decided that it is really important to form collaborative connections with other iGEM teams in order to integrate our own team into iGEM community and advance the integration of Lithuanian scientists into worldwide scientific community as well.
We got the chance to fulfill our expectations pretty soon. On June 1st – 3rd, 2015, we hosted a meetup with a SDU iGEM team from University of Southern Denmark. It was a great opportunity to meet other iGEMers.
SDU and Vilnius iGEM teams during lectures at the Institute of Biotechnology.
SDU team already have participated in iGEM competition for 5 times, so they have a lot of background knowledge and experience to share with the first-timers such as we are. They were the first ones to propose a meeting between teams, so we gladly accepted and listened to all the advices they gave us.
On the first day we presented each other our iGEM project ideas and discussed their importance, methods, application and other aspects. SDU iGEM team helped us a lot to gain a better insight on how to start and make a succesful iGEM project. They made a presentation on wiki creation and style, also a presentation on what is iGEM competition in general and what requirements we should not forget. All this information was not only helpful, but interesting as well and out of this meetup Vilnius iGEM team obtained tons of experience.
During the tour.
On the second day both teams had a visit to a local Thermo Fisher Scientific, where scientists presented their work and achievements and told us a little bit of history of this exact company, how it came to be and how it evolved from Fermentas in Lithuania. After that, we had several lectures on different topics: it was mainly related with the researches made here, in Lithuania. It was really interesting to listen how normal scientific research at the Institute of Biotechnology is made.
During the last day we visited the old town of our capital Vilnius and the main historical and cultural sites. We hope that SDU team enjoyed our meeting as much as we did and learned interesting and useful facts as well.
Big thanks goes to:
SDU iGEM team – for coming!
Giedrius Gasiūnas for a lecture about CRISPR/Cas system and its application.
Aleksandras Osipenko for a lecture about modular proteins and nucleic acid technologies.
Robertas Galinis for a lecture about microfluidics.
ThermoFisher Scientific for a guided tour around the laboratories.

Other attributions
iGEM competition takes a lot of effort and hardwork to participate in. According to these circumstances, our team is sure that without some people Vilnius iGEM team would have been impossible. In a week or two here you will see is a list of the people that we are very grateful to. Project support and advices for team establishment were received from many people, including academic society and political figures.
General support
We are giving our sincere thank you to prof. Eugenijus Butkus (a prorector of Vilnius University), the dean of the Faculty of Natural Sciences prof. Osvaldas Rukšėnas and a vice dean assoc. prof. Jurga Turčinavičienė and the founder of “We love Lithuania” campaign Simonas Rudaminas. Even Gediminas Miškinis, a chancellor of the Ministry of Economy, expressed a great support for us and gave some advices. We would be still searching a place to live and some other headaches will still be, if not Romena Savickienė. With a help of her, the embassy of Lithuania in the USA (Justina Krutulytė, Laura Šerenienė, Rolandas Kriščiūnas) and the worldwide society of  lithuanians (Dalia Shilas and Dalia Henke) we found home to live during the conference. Big thanks also go to ""Baltic Clippers"" tourism and travel company and especially Tatjana Pavlova, who helped us to catch the best flight offers. We are kindly grateful for Vilnius Tourism and Information center for their booklets about Lithuania. We want to thank Association of Lithuanian Natural Sciences Olympiad, together with Vilius Malūnavičius and Rūta Leinartaitė for helping us out with the technical paperwork.
Laboratory support
For every kind of advices we are saying a big thank you to a mathematician Irus Grinis, the bioinformatics team at the Institute of Biotechnology (dr. Visvaldas Kairys and dr. Darius Kazlauskas) We got big help with the modeling from Juozas Gordevičius. During the hard days in the lab we are grateful for having an opportunity to seek for advices from our principal investigator prof. Virginijus Šikšnys, prof. Rolandas Meškys, dr. Giedrius Gasiūnas, PhD. Justas Lazutka, dr. Tomas Šinkūnas and PhD. Inga Songailienė. The InterLab Measurement project would have been be much harder without the advices from prof. Edita Sužiedelienė and Julita Armalytė. Big thanks go to PhD. Inga Songailienė for sharing laboratory techniques such as fluorescence measurements, Western blot and others.
Fundraising support
To achieve the required funds would be even much harder without ""Enterprise Lithuania"" advices and financial support from our prime sponsors “Thermofisher Scientific” in a friendly communication of dr. Egidijus Jaseliūnas, as well as “Neurotechnology” with a well-organized sponsorship by Algimantas Malickas and Irmantas Naujikas and Vilnius University. Moreover, we were not only generally supported by Vilnius University. They also helped us at the very beginning to pay the team registration fee. For the quick help with some kit’s and primers we are more than thankful for “Linea libera” with Sigitas Burinskas in front of it, and Lina Piešinienė, who helped with primers from “Nanodiagnostika”.
Not only huge companies can help you with the fundraising – the greatest and the warmest person we met is Alina Bezuglova and her teammate Aurelija Degulytė. Our first meeting would have been impossible without a help from Vytautas Bivainis and Vytautas Kalinauskas. Some insights were shared by Rūta Kruliauskaitė, who did a probably the most succeeded  crowdfunding campaign for her studies at New York City.
Public outreach support
The great project manager at the Enterprise Lithuania – Raminta Kaleinikaitė and a trainee Sonata Brokevičiūtė, who also helped us with the presentation skills. How to rule the world of society and make us a well-known project? Please seek for an advice at “OMConsulting” and our the best advisor Milda Gaulienė and for the first business card we got – thank you Orijana Mašalė (the owner of ""OMConsulting""). All the publications and all the requests for financial support would have been less successful without your help. After the sneaky preview of presentations we could join a huge events at our friends “LITEXPO” place and in the pleasure of that we can collaborate with the “Baltic Innovative Technology Institute” (Tomas Žalandauskas). Also, the press of Vilnius University was much more than friendly to us, so thank you, Agnė Grinevičiūtė. Interested topics were presented by PhD. Aleksandr Osipenko, PhD. Robertas Galinis and dr. Giedrius Gasiūnas to our team and our guests from danish SDU team.
Design support
To paint the face of our team, after all the team members opinions and some designs by Danielius, we are thankful for the greatest camera-man Evaldas Valaitis (and all the editing work), PhD. Linas Tamošaitis, for our painter Monika Jasnauskaitė for an illustration for innovation fair and photographer Paulius Mielinis for taking the good quality pictures. Extremely big thanks goes to Monika Kairevičiūtė for drawing beautiful icons for our wiki page.
Webdesign
The Vilnius iGEM website was coded and designed by team member Danielius Dvareckas. After coding website he explained to other team members how to use this code and make additional content changes. To wiki design also contributed other team members by suggesting wiki tweaks.
Graphic elements used on index page four boxes (just below the slider) and judging form were drawn by Monika Kairevičiūtė. Diagrams in descriptions were drawn by team member Ieva Savickytė. Icons used in footer were taken and re-designed to match wiki design from free stock icons website. All drawing and stock icons were retouched by Danielius Dvareckas using open source vector software Inkscape.
Twitter Bootstrap 3 (v3.3.1) - sleek, intuitive, and powerful front-end framework for faster and easier responsive web development. normalize.css was used to reset the wiki style.
jQuery (v1.11.3) is a powerful JavaScript extension library.
History.js was used to ensure compatibility with HTML4 browsers, that do not support history.pushState().
Slimbox 2 (v2.05) was used as a picture viewer. The code had to be adapted to work with the wiki and bxSlider. TU-Munich (2013) had already solved this issue, so modified slimbox 2 version by TU-Munich (2013) was used.
bxSlider (v4.1.1) is a JavaScript library which allowed to add slider on wiki front page.

ABOUT US
Our team this year consists of about 15 undergraduate students, eager to learn about and explore the field of synthetic                     biology. Our members this year have all come from such diverse backgrounds and have each contributed to QGEM 2015 in their                 own unique way.
Scroll down to learn more about the members of QGEM 2015!
Joanna Semrau
Joanna is in her fourth year studying Life Sciences and Psychology. She has been involved with QGEM for a number of years now, and has truly found it an exciting learning experience! Joanna plans to pursue research that could possibly combine her interests in psychology and molecular biology. In developing her skills in human resources and web design, she thinks the next step for her may be managing a circus and learning to tame giraffes.
Justine Ring
Justine is in her final year of Life Sciences. After volunteering with the team last summer she decided to come back to play a more prominent role in the project. Justine is hopeful that her bike issues will be resolved and she may one day have a functional means of transportation to and from work. When not planning her escape back to the East Coast, she finds time to enjoy the small joys of life, such as writing essays and working later than everyone else.
Morgan Litschko
Morgan is in her third year studying Engineering Chemistry. She saw QGEM as an opportunity to merge her interests in engineering and biochemistry, while also finding an excuse to look at cute ocean pout images. Morgan hopes to graduate engineering successfully without switching faculties any more times! She spends most of her time trying to convince the team to incorporate more yellow into team presentations.
Malak Elbatarny
Malak will be starting first year medicine in the fall. With a passion for innovative research, she joined QGEM to become part of a team that works towards solving a problem. QGEM also fuelled Malak’s competitive spirit! Playing a prominent role in external affairs and finances on the team, Malak is often found on the phone or responding to questions with “okay first, let me make some calls.”!
Kersh Theva
Kersh has just finished his degree in the Life Sciences. Upon discovering QGEM and its members, he was struck by their free-roaming spirits, scientific competence and thirst for knowledge. Kersh became enchanted by the possibilities that this field presented. He continues to follow the stream of bioengineering innovation, wherever it takes him. In addition, Kersh has also worked as a sheep farmer in southeast Ontario.
Amanda Fantin
Amanda is in her third year studying Biology and Life Sciences. She saw QGEM as an amazing opportunity to pursue her interest and develop skills in synthetic biology and biotechnology. Amanda hopes to study medicine as well as further enhance the standards of care and quality of life through research. Amanda also has two cats, Mozart and Shakespeare, who are described by her as the loves of her life.

Candice is in her fourth year studying Life Sciences and Psychology. She joined QGEM this summer to develop laboratory skills; learn more about synthetic biology; and to connect with students, faculty, and members of the Kingston community.  She hopes to pursue graduate studies in Pathophysiology or Neuroscience. In her spare time, you may find Candice watching hilarious cat videos or making balloon animals.
Dragos Chiriac
Dragos is in his third year of Life Science. With this year's QGEM team being primarily female, he figured it would be the perfect environment to overcome his issues talking to the opposite gender. He has been forced to discover his passion for computer science and has learned about the requirements of being volun-told, I mean, volunteering. In his free time, he can be found resolving the world's issues using PyRosetta while claiming to be studying for the MCAT.
Julia Grein
Julia is in her second year, studying Biochemistry with a certificate in Business. She first found out about QGEM in her first year and knew that this was an invaluable opportunity to dive into the world of synthetic biology. As for the future, Julia plans to keep her options open after her undergraduate studies while also maintaining a strong interest in research and lab work. Julia is affectionately known as the munchkin of QGEM 2015.
Danielle Ciren
Danielle is in her second year studying Biology. She was excited by the prospect of participating in QGEM because of the opportunities to learn new skills and apply her classroom knowledge to real life research! In the future, Danielle would like to pursue graduate studies in biology or health care. She is known for love of Tim Horton's Iced Capps.
Jia Tanwani
Jia is in her third year of Life Science. Viewing innovation as the basis for all advancements, she was fascinated by the scientific innovation within QGEM and eager to be part of a team working to solve real-world problems. Her future aspirations include writing a book (topic to be decided), and climbing Mount Everest! A fun fact about Jia is that her birthday is on Halloween :)

Our Team
The Our Lady of the Snows Catholic Academy iGEM team is a Canadian team hailing from Canmore, Alberta, a small mountain town located 4296 feet above sea level, where it snows 11 months of the year and where bears, mountain goats, elk and other wildlife are common sights from our labs windows. Our principal regularly must chase elk off our field with a megaphone. This small Catholic school is home to just 70 high school students. This year, our team consists of five grade eleven students, one grade ten student and two tired teachers. Five of our six team members are female, with 3 team members returning for the second year in a row. Our team is dynamic and is made up of brains, athletes, basket cases, princesses and “criminals”.
Student Team Members
Alina Arvisais - She's beauty, she's grace, and she almost fell on her face while taking this picture.  Apart from the fun with teammates, my favourite things about this project include learning just how much work science and computer work can be.  Because of iGEM I've had plenty of opportunities to do this through lab work, reasearch, safety, creating a poster, working on the wiki, making a logo, and much much more.  Apart from that, I spend my time rock climbing.
Maria Buchko - I am a grade 11 student at Our Lady of the Snows. I dance, play lots of sports, and I spend a lot of my life on the internet, and reading pick-up lines. I wish I was Adenine so I could be paired with U. I joined iGem so that I could learn more about science because everyone needs lots of science in their life. Also for the experiences. iGem is a great opportunity to learn new and unique skills, along with being able to connect with many different people. As a Canadian, I can vouch for the fact that we ride moose to school (but only in the winter) and we drink maple syrup all day every day
Talia Dixon Hello, my name is Talia Dixon. I am a grade 11 student at Our Lady Of The Snows Catholic Academy. I was born and raised in the small town of Canmore, Alberta, Canada. This is my second year participating in IGEM. My jobs in IGEM are poster, wiki, policies and practices, lab work, ethics, and outreach. My other pass-times include debate, student council, social justice, hockey and hand ball. I love IGEM for so many reasons - it has allowed me to learn more then I ever could have out of the curriculum, furthermore, iGEM has let me meet and grow close to the amazing people on and off my team.
Joshua Lamb -I am a grade 11 student who loves learning and applying science to the real world. This is why I joined iGem - I love science! This year I am taking all of the sciences in pursuit of the subject that i enjoy the most. I am also British and like to think that I have good fashion sense.
Erika Maier -My name is Erika Maier.  I was born and raised here in Canmore.  I am 14 years old and in grade 10 - which makes me the youngest student on our iGEM team.  My hobbies consist of sports ranging from volleyball to track and field, and basketball to handball.  I am a nerd for math and enjoy reciting and memorizing digits of pi.
Freya Morgan I am a grade 11 student from Britain that moved from the Motherland in 2009. I’ve been to 7 different schools, in 3 different countries. I have not lost my Britishness as I drink tea and eat crumpets everyday while watching Doctor Who and reading Harry Potter. I dance four nights a week, do Royal Academy of Dance Ballet exams, and tap dance everywhere. This is my second year in iGEM. I joined because science is my favourite subject at school (because it is super awesome), and because many opportunities can arise from this experience. I love iGEM because it is really cool getting to do really awesome lab work, and I can see what other people my age and university students around the world are doing.
Teachers
Mr. Arvisais ""Hair today gone tomorrow"" - that is pretty much our mission this year. Think of the millions of tons of chicken feathers and hair annually that could be broken down to a more resourceful state (closer to their amino acids). I think that this may be the first picture that I have ever worn a wig for. I probably should have put on a green wig to bring out the colour of my eyes through my 3D glasses.  Cheers in Boston!
Mrs. Puurunen I'm a mother, biology/special education teacher, technology enthusiast, semi-pro (read: recreational) mountain biker, and a general grumpypants.  iGEM has been even more exciting and exhausting in year 2 - I feel like we have all learned so much!  Pretty soon we won't even need my chart paper drawings posted all over the lab.  I'm hoping our project works so well that I'm bald by the time we touchdown in Boston.
We would also like to thank our mentors: Dr. Magda Pop, Lisa Oberding, and Dan Ziemianowicz for all their help throughout the year.  Without them, our iGEM experience would not have been this positive, and we certainly would not have learned as much.

I.FAMILY PHOTO(CLICK)
In 2015, NUDT_China is made up of 10 students and 5 instructors. Jie Li and Juanjuan Huang are undergraduates from Clinical Medicine in Central South University. Yuan Zhang is exchange student from Southern Medical University. The rest 7 students are from National University of Defense Technology who have different majors, from chemistry to aviation.
We got together, trying to figure out what we could do with synthetic biology. During the study of iGEM project, we inspired and encouraged each other. Now, iGEM is a family to us all.
We also appreciate all the others who provided valuable advice and essential materials for the project. If it were not for their help, the project would not have been so successful.
NOTE: Instructor Long Liu and Student Yizhou Wang are absent in the family photo for timetable clash.
II. Student(CLICK)
You can know everyone contributions on our ATTRIBUTION page .
You can get every students' self introduction below. :)
Xinyuan Qiu:
Hello there, I'm Xinyuan Qiu, the originator of the team NUDT_CHINA. In our project I cover most part of the wet lab as well as the poster designing and the presentation. I also participated in the project designing and some other PR issues. As a bio-geek, I abhor boring life and chase after new and exciting things. That's why I'm here for the iGEM and that's also why my team can be formed and fight its way to this far in face of lots of predictable and unpredictable obstacles in NUDT. It's my great honor to have all my team members with me in iGEM 2015, and I believe that we can get what we want from It.
Nianhao Xie:
I am Nianhao Xie, who is responsible for the modeling and wiki building. I have great curiosity to the unknown fields especially the secrets of life. Living in a small village made it possible for me to observe and think about the nature. I am good at painting and mathematics which enhance imaginal thinking and logic thinking. Although I am just an amateur of biology, I am inspired by grasping new knowledge and applying what I know (as an engineering student) to synthetic biology. I enjoy the process of brainstorming and arguing with my partners. (We are full of enthusiasm!)
Zhu Qianhui:
I’m Rose Zhu, a girl from Jiujiang city which is a lovely city near Poyang Lake. I have never been away from water. I enjoy dance and imagine I were a stream wiggling by the forests. Water is the best description of my personalities. I’m of a gentle and flexible nature. I can feel that under the water surface, there is secret of life calling for my exploration. Being a member of NUDT-China for IGEM, I’m excited by sharing curiosity, knowledge and ideas about biology.
Jiaqi Sun:
My name is Jiaqi Sun. I come from Shandong province, which is thought to have many burly fellows. But not for me. I’m just a normal person who likes playing computer games and watching some animations. And I hate sports. Last year my teacher introduce iGEM to me. And then, after sometime of studying biology experiment, I have learnt how to do most of the experiments. This is difficult for me because I’m not a biology student. My undergraduate course is chemistry. However, in any case, I love biology. And I’ll do my best to do IGEM.
Yuan Zhang:
I'm Yuan Zhang, a medical student. The curiosity to biology and the little knowledge I learned at high school encouraged me to join in this team. Fortunately, I learned everything needed for IGEM from our instructors and other members. I cover parts of the wet lab and give some ideas for our human practice. I cherish these months' life in this big warm family. To live, to experience. I believe everyone of our team have experienced and learned something to enrich our life.
Dongyu Fan:
Hi, my name is Dongyu Fan. I'm from a historical city, Xi'an, which is a subtle blend of glorious history and modern civilization. Similarly, my character also has two sides, calm and delicate, also warm and lively. The same is true of my hobbies, I have great interest in both humanities and natural sciences, which makes my way of thinking both rational and emotional. This is my first time to participate in iGEM, and it's really a long and hard way from a non-professional person to a qualified experimenter. But to be honest, I firmly believe that the process is more important than the result. In this year, I deeply enjoy the time spending with the team members and also enjoy the fun of playing biology. that is my greatest achievement!
Juanjuan Huang:
My name is Juanjuan Huang. I'm a senior undergraduate majoring in Central South University. Because of the curiousness about iGEM, I joined the NUDT_CHINA. I take part in the construct of plasmid. The experience of working in iGEM team is really interesting. At the same time, I can learn more and more from other teammates who are not limited to the experimental skills of synthetic biology. Although there are new challenges every day, I enjoy the time to cooperate with them. No matter what we win in the end, I always believe that we will have an unforgettable experience.
Jie Li:
I am currently studying Clinical Medicine in Central South University. As a matter of fact, I joined the iGEM team of NUDT_CHINA by chance because of listening to a charming presentation of Xinyun Qiu, the originator last year. That’s quite an honor for me to participate in this family this year. With my knowledge of both medical biology and molecular biology, I hope to contribute to putting our experiment design into effect and go for a wonderful result.
Wang Yizhou:
Hello, I am Yizhou Wang, a member of the team NUDT_China, who used to be a participant of the National Competition of Biology in senior high school. Biology has always been my best subject. In our team, I work for Human practice, interviewing an expert mainly. I’m a quiet person with little words, but I have a passionate side which cannot be noticed easily. I enjoy the time in which I make several new friends, learn new knowledge through working with my partners.
Chushu Zhu:
My name is Chushu Zhu. I come from a beautiful city named Lishui, located in Zhejiang China. I am a junior at the National University of Defense Technology, major in chemistry. The undergraduate education gave me a wide range of vision and taught me how to cooperate with others. While learning biological knowledge and technique, I also get a sense of other field at the same time. That’s why I join the team of NUDT_CHINA. Synthetic biology is so magical, and my teammates’ brilliant ideas win my great admiration as well. This project offers me a good chance to give full play to my creativity, intelligence and diligence.

I.FAMILY PHOTO(CLICK)
In 2015, NUDT_China is made up of 10 students and 5 instructors. Jie Li and Juanjuan Huang are undergraduates from Clinical Medicine in Central South University. Yuan Zhang is exchange student from Southern Medical University. The rest 7 students are from National University of Defense Technology who have different majors, from chemistry to aviation.
We got together, trying to figure out what we could do with synthetic biology. During the study of iGEM project, we inspired and encouraged each other. Now, iGEM is a family to us all.
We also appreciate all the others who provided valuable advice and essential materials for the project. If it were not for their help, the project would not have been so successful.
NOTE: Instructor Long Liu and Student Yizhou Wang are absent in the family photo for timetable clash.
II. EVERYONE(CLICK)
You can know everyone contributions on our ATTRIBUTION page .
You can get every students' self introduction below. :)
Xinyuan Qiu:
Hello there, I'm Xinyuan Qiu, the originator of the team NUDT_CHINA. In our project I cover most part of the wet lab as well as the poster designing and the presentation. I also participated in the project designing and some other PR issues. As a bio-geek, I abhor boring life and chase after new and exciting things. That's why I'm here for the iGEM and that's also why my team can be formed and fight its way to this far in face of lots of predictable and unpredictable obstacles in NUDT. It's my great honor to have all my team members with me in iGEM 2015, and I believe that we can get what we want from It.
Nianhao Xie:
I am Nianhao Xie, who is responsible for the modeling and wiki building. I have great curiosity to the unknown fields especially the secrets of life. Living in a small village made it possible for me to observe and think about the nature. I am good at painting and mathematics which enhance imaginal thinking and logic thinking. Although I am just an amateur of biology, I am inspired by grasping new knowledge and applying what I know (as an engineering student) to synthetic biology. I enjoy the process of brainstorming and arguing with my partners. (We are full of enthusiasm!)
Zhu Qianhui:
I’m Rose Zhu, a girl from Jiujiang city which is a lovely city near Poyang Lake. I have never been away from water. I enjoy dance and imagine I were a stream wiggling by the forests. Water is the best description of my personalities. I’m of a gentle and flexible nature. I can feel that under the water surface, there is secret of life calling for my exploration. Being a member of NUDT-China for IGEM, I’m excited by sharing curiosity, knowledge and ideas about biology.
Jiaqi Sun:
My name is Jiaqi Sun. I come from Shandong province, which is thought to have many burly fellows. But not for me. I’m just a normal person who likes playing computer games and watching some animations. And I hate sports. Last year my teacher introduce iGEM to me. And then, after sometime of studying biology experiment, I have learnt how to do most of the experiments. This is difficult for me because I’m not a biology student. My undergraduate course is chemistry. However, in any case, I love biology. And I’ll do my best to do IGEM.
Yuan Zhang:
I'm Yuan Zhang, a medical student. The curiosity to biology and the little knowledge I learned at high school encouraged me to join in this team. Fortunately, I learned everything needed for IGEM from our instructors and other members. I cover parts of the wet lab and give some ideas for our human practice. I cherish these months' life in this big warm family. To live, to experience. I believe everyone of our team have experienced and learned something to enrich our life.
Dongyu Fan:
Hi, my name is Dongyu Fan. I'm from a historical city, Xi'an, which is a subtle blend of glorious history and modern civilization. Similarly, my character also has two sides, calm and delicate, also warm and lively. The same is true of my hobbies, I have great interest in both humanities and natural sciences, which makes my way of thinking both rational and emotional. This is my first time to participate in iGEM, and it's really a long and hard way from a non-professional person to a qualified experimenter. But to be honest, I firmly believe that the process is more important than the result. In this year, I deeply enjoy the time spending with the team members and also enjoy the fun of playing biology. that is my greatest achievement!
Juanjuan Huang:
My name is Juanjuan Huang. I'm a senior undergraduate majoring in Central South University. Because of the curiousness about iGEM, I joined the NUDT_CHINA. I take part in the construct of plasmid. The experience of working in iGEM team is really interesting. At the same time, I can learn more and more from other teammates who are not limited to the experimental skills of synthetic biology. Although there are new challenges every day, I enjoy the time to cooperate with them. No matter what we win in the end, I always believe that we will have an unforgettable experience.
Jie Li:
I am currently studying Clinical Medicine in Central South University. As a matter of fact, I joined the iGEM team of NUDT_CHINA by chance because of listening to a charming presentation of Xinyun Qiu, the originator last year. That’s quite an honor for me to participate in this family this year. With my knowledge of both medical biology and molecular biology, I hope to contribute to putting our experiment design into effect and go for a wonderful result.
Wang Yizhou:
Hello, I am Yizhou Wang, a member of the team NUDT_China, who used to be a participant of the National Competition of Biology in senior high school. Biology has always been my best subject. In our team, I work for Human practice, interviewing an expert mainly. I’m a quiet person with little words, but I have a passionate side which cannot be noticed easily. I enjoy the time in which I make several new friends, learn new knowledge through working with my partners.
Chushu Zhu:
My name is Chushu Zhu. I come from a beautiful city named Lishui, located in Zhejiang China. I am a junior at the National University of Defense Technology, major in chemistry. The undergraduate education gave me a wide range of vision and taught me how to cooperate with others. While learning biological knowledge and technique, I also get a sense of other field at the same time. That’s why I join the team of NUDT_CHINA. Synthetic biology is so magical, and my teammates’ brilliant ideas win my great admiration as well. This project offers me a good chance to give full play to my creativity, intelligence and diligence.

STUDENTS
We work as a wonderful team. We come from different departments of Fudan. We unite under the Bertalanffy Association. Everyone has earned a position and stuck to it through the whole project. We designed the whole project and did all the experiment by ourselves. We worked in schools and society to educate public with our own efforts. We designed and painted as if we are the greatest art designers. We worked on the modeling and wiki pages day and night to achieve the best. Every bit of effort has together brought here our final presentation. Everyone, well done!
Xilin Jiang
I am a junior in the school of life science, Fudan University. As the team leader, my mission is to coordinate the whole team’s work. I have a strong passion in synthetic biology while always participate in public affairs, so I work both in the lab and in the community. I believe that our team should propagate the basic idea of synthetic biology to the whole school. Consequently, I have paid a lot of attention to the influence of synthetic biology in Fudan, which has the best genetic labs in China. Fudan team is only set for a few months, but I hope we can initiate a trend for synthetic biology for a much longer time.
Yifeng Huang
I’m Yifeng Huang, a junior in School of Life Science, Fudan University. I love science and technology, and I really believe that we can make a better world with advanced technology. I was really fascinated by the idea that we can design and construct biological systems. That’s the reason I participate in iGEM. In the team, I deal with biobrick parts. I’m really looking forward to see what cool things other teams have made. See you in Boston!

She is the leader of ITB_Indonesia team or you could call her the “General Assistant”. Ika has to arrange the team for what they need to do based on the final decision of the team meeting. She does the work of wetlab and other divisions. See?? She looks like a general assistant but she’d love it very much.
Her hobby is reading, but reading journal isn't her hobby. Besides that, She really likes watching movie and cycling, because they make her relax and also kills the stress after lab work.
She joined this team because she just wants to enrich her experience because she is experience seeker...
After joining the team, hwooooooo so many things to think, so many things to do but she'd love it very much because it makes her upgrade herself about a lot of things.

Public Relation
He is the Head of Wetlab Division of ITB_Indonesia, holds the responsibility to conduct the experiments. Despite his tight schedules, he loves reading, swimming, listening to classical musics, and series-binge watching.
His motivation to participate in this team is to develop the synthetic biology in Indonesia.
He thinks that the ITB_Indonesia 2015 is an AWESOME team.
“Yes, wetlab is exhausting but the whole experience of working interdisciplinary with awesome people is so engaging and mind-opening.”
She is the secretary of our team and also a member of the wetlab division.
Her main responsibility as secretary is to manage administration tasks in the team such as proposal activity for internal and external fundraising, and a lot of letters for iGEM ITB_Indonesia activity permission. At the wetlab division, she does some couple tasks and make sure the facilities and equipments are available for the wetlab work. She also loves to help fundraising project whether she keeps the money or accounting the money that flow in and out in our lab.
Her hobbies are traveling and snorkeling around Indonesia, even now she rarely does it because she still conducts her research in master degree. Her other hobbies is drawing, make a doodle and some random amateur design, she puts a couple of her artwork in her social media network such as Inst**ram and T*m*lr.
Indah is very interested in synthetic biology and she hopes by joining ITB_Indonesia team will enrich her experience in manage big interdisciplinary research project. Besides that, she wants to improve her team management skill and team working skills together with ITB_Indonesia member.
After several months in the team, she feel like sit in ferris wheel because sometimes it up, sometimes it down, feel like sweet and bitter simultaneously. In her opinion iGEM is the real competition not only comparing our work with other team, but also how we can manage and improve ourselves together to be more competent to reach our project goal. It is all about teamwork, hard working, responsibility and of course, big heart. She really love her team mate :).
Haryanto is working together with the human practice team to hold education and public engagement related events in order to promote synthetic biology in Indonesia and to educate the society.
At his free time, he loves reading books, watching movies, and playing games.
He was eager to join this team because he'd like to participate in a international level competition and also to enhance his leadership experience besides expanding his connections.
Based from his experience, he could gain a lot of experiences after joining this team, by overcoming all the challenges and issues regarding the iGEM competition. My fellow iGEM team members inspire me a lot in their own way and this made him happy.
As a fund raising coordinator, first, she evaluates iGEM ITB_Indonesia 2014 sponsorship tracks. Collect company contacts that have a prospect for our sponsorship proposal through colleagues and company’s website. Once the proposal is done, it is reviewed by the team members. Then she selects team members who will be responsible to send the proposal to some of the listed company. Proposal is sent by mail or email. The company is contacted for proposals confirmation by phone or email after 2-4 weeks. Another fund raising role is done by selling beverages, flowers, lunch, iGEM_Indonesia T-shirt, and etc.
Not only actively involved in the fund raising activities, as a wetlab team member, she is responsible for laboratory preparation such as accommodate laboratory supply, provide competent E. coli cells for cloning and expression. Then assembling reporter module and also have it transformed to E. coli cells.
Her hobbies are playing with cats and playing music.
Since contributing in synthetic biology is completely new for her, so she hopes that this practice will be more comprehensive rather than lecture in class. This practice provides her an ability to be creative and innovative inside or outside the laboratory. This competition also supports her to build a teamwork with a different disciplines and improve our leadership and managerial skill, how to act with integrity, courage, dedication and full of responsibility. So, iGEM is not only a place to get involved in synthetic biology but also a race in world class competition. I hope that in 2015 ITB could maintain the gold titles.
iGEM provides her a really brand new experience working with synthetic biology and also with the team, where we came up with unpredictable results. First, the modelling division confirmed that out first designated module will not work as expected. Then our wetlab division has to turn back re-designing a new module that fully approved by the modelling division. Second, Indonesia 2015 first quarters unstable economic condition consequence many of our proposal got rejected. While we have to deal with the weakness of IDR (Indonesia Rupiah) exchange value to USD (US Dollar). This situation urges our team to raise the money harder, for example by designing and selling an iGEM_Indonesia T-shirt to our colleagues. But this moment also makes our team solid. Third, Seminar and Meet Up iGEM 2015 All Indonesia Team, which was initiated and held by our human practice division is overall awesome. This was the very first moment where all iGEM Indonesia team could be gathered. At this meetup we also shared our iGEM project to the participants whose have different background such as computational, chemistry, mathematics, and etc. Lastly, iGEM competition is completely unforgettable experience for her. Viva iGEM!
He is the one responsible for our public relations matters, striving to connect ITB_Indonesia team with the other iGEM teams and the society.
At his free time, he loves badminton and swimming.
He hopes to help to create a bigger achievement for ITB_Indonesia team.
He thinks our team is great, because we have high spirit to win this competition.

She wants to learn many things by joining this team.
She thought that this team has a good team work and there are so many thing to do.
She is the coordinator of design division at iGEM ITB team. Paramita, usually called Mita, plans every art and design related work in iGEM ITB_Indonesia 2015 team and coordinates the designing projects with team members, including team Wiki, team hoodie and t-shirt, team logo, posters, presentation, etc.
She loves drawing to fill her free time.
She was eager to join th iGEM ITB this year because she wants to get new friends, new knowledge, new experience. In addition, she’d like to share anything she has with the others, and also to introduce what Synbio is to the world.
She said that, “Being in iGEM ITB team is not easy at all! Need extra energy hahaha!”
Rifqi plays important role in our team. He gives his time and energy at three divisions, that are human practice staff, sponsorship, and design.
Cycling is his hobby.
He joins iGEM ITB 2015 because he wants to improve his social skill in human practice division. Besides that, he is also interested in life science experiment and wants to share this excitement to all the world~
He feels that he has sharpened his ability, especially public speaking because of our work in some places to sell something. He also enhances this skill because he is highly involved in the one of the human practice projects, Car Free Day (CFD) Survey.
She is actively involved in both wetlab and human practice division. At wetlab division: her work is in bioinformatics, she examines the sequencing result, align 16S sequence and make a phylogenetics tree for confirmation. She also studies the rhlAB genes in many bacteria (Pseudomonas, Bulkhorderia, and Bacillus) from database to understand the differences. On the other hand, at human practice: her worked is to promote Indonesian iGEM Team in Bandung Indonesia especially ITB_Indonesia Team and made a Meet Up event to gather all Indonesian iGEM Team.
Her hobby is drinking coffee, listening to music, and hanging with friends.
She likes studying biology. Her field is molecular ecology and conservation. She learned that she could apply synthetic biology to cope with ecological problem so she want to learn about synthetic biology and gain some experience to participate in international competition.
She thought that, “Synthetic biology is very diverse and it consist of many fields. We need to work together to solve a problem. I gain many information and I learn new fields. It was some experience for me.”
You could call her “Ida”. “A double agent” is undoubtedly needed in iGEM team. Just like the other members, she also works for human practice activities besides wetlab division. Sharing our project to people is one of her favorites.
For her wetlab activities, working with primer and synthetic gene is her main focus. She designs the primers and analyzes our synthetic genes. She also works with PCR and gel electrophoresis as her daily routine in our laboratory.
“Just give her tons of novels and she will nail it. Indeed, she loves to read books especially novels.
To learn, not to ask.
To think, not to judge.
To contemplate, not to disregard.
Those are her motivations.
She said that, ""Happiness is when you are lovable in a lovely team, and now I am happy because I have my team.""

She is a member of the wetlab team. Her main job is doing experiments resulting with the standard curve and growth curve of bacteria used in our project. She thought that in the experiments we must measure amount of bacteria/mL, concentration of specific substrat (D-glucose and lactose), concentration of rhamnolipid produced by bacteria etc... Unique challenges in this job are risk of contamination, inoculate bacteria with spread technique which need full of patience otherwise the medium will rupture and can't be used, and also we must work near fire and alcohol.
Her hobbies are handycrafting, writing, cooking
She wants to learn more about molecular laboratory activity, especially how to engineered gene of bacteria and also to learn teamwork, hear others opinions and learn to discuss to solve problems.
Many lesson she got joining to  the iGEM ITB 2015. She learns how to work in team. She got many friends from other study programs. She hopes the crowdedness of laboratory schedule will improve her skills with the laboratory situations and challenges in there..
He does wetlab kind of stuff that is related to microbiology field with less influence from genetic based method.
Rio loves doing multiple kind of sports and playing with cats.
Joining the team is one of the way for him to try to push himself to the utmost limit of his ability to allow proliferation of his ability in this field.
His testimony after involving in the team  is that “Pretty tire some and actually not much can be helped considering most of the problem were financial or lack of equipment.”
Kinanti helps a lot at the human practice and wet lab division.
At her sparetime, she likes to read, write, doodle, learn to cook, swim and listening to music. Tough, most of the time she spends her time to observing and listening to the surroundings.
Her ultimate motivation is to learn and to contribute in the development of Synthetic Biology in her college and her country.
For the iGEM ITB 2015 team, she thinks that it's really exciting because she really has to learn a lot, and learned a lot during participating in the team. The team members are diverse and yet very open to share their minds.
Satria is the member of the wetlab division.
He provides competent E. coli cells for cloning and expression, assembling reporter module, provide standard and growth curve of E. coli BL21
This guy love to sleep in his free time.
He’d just want to contribute in his own way by joining this team.
There are so much things that he had discovered about synthetic biology, and he realizes how small the world we lived in, based from his experience at ITB_Indonesia.
Udin is the member of modelling division at our team.
He loves reading novel, playing violin, playing computer game, and also solving riddles.
He’d like to apply mathematics in everyday life and to promote mathematics in Indonesia by joining the team.
For him, the iGEM 2015 activities are quite hectic. But it's fun for him to work and to see lots of people from different department working with each other.

This guy is the wiki guy.
He's among the few who understands code in the team.
He wonders why he didn't go on to study computer science.
The iGEM 2015 team gave him an opportunity to practice coding and have fun while doing it.
Lusi is our team treasurer and wetlab member. She helps us in collecting money fee from each member every week, updating financial report, and arrange fundraising event such as selling drinks at graduation ceremony.
She loves reading, listening to music, running, and swimming.
She is aiming to join an international competition this year and she has been familiar with iGem since last year. That's why she join the iGEM team this year so she could fulfill her resolution. She is very happy yet busy in this summer. It's an exciting experience to join the iGEM team of ITB for her.
Help wetlab team to make competent cell, make standart curve bacteria, etc and help human practice project such as sosialization about our project to civilization.  walking, watching TV, cycling.
this is a fancy and fantastic competion so maybe she will dissapoint if she doesn't join this project. another reason is want to learn about everything about how to work as a team work, how to work in molecular biology.
After join she think that she get syndrome called ""Horizontal gene Transfer"" hehe....but it's no problem because in this team she can find a new friend and a new big family..  there are many experience, in here she learn about failed, about trial and error, and about victory yeye...
Ivan loves to play.
Involving in the modelling division of iGEM ITB team is a way for him to get new experience about bacteria modelling.
He thought that there was so much fun at the team.

Thank you!
Here we want to thank everyone who supported us this year and thus helped us make our project come true. Numerous individuals, research groups, departments and companies supported us throughout the entire project and here we want to say thank you for this!
A special thanks goes to Prof. Dr. Roland Eils, Dr. Irina Lehmann and Dr. Barbara Di Ventura who instructed our team and to Lukas Brenner, Katharina Höfer, Stefan Kallenberger, Ilia Kats and Philipp Walch who mentored us this year as advisors.
All lab work including primer and construct design, PCRs, minipreps, making cells competent, cryo-stocking, cloning, tranforming, pouring and running of gels, nanodropping, fluorescence measurements, preparation of samples, blotting, all the funny stuff etc. was performed by members of the iGEM Team Heidelberg only.
More precisely, Jasmin, Michael and Daniel worked on the establishment of AptaBodies for Western blotting. The application for Southern blotting was added by Frieda. The system for the detection of small molecules was developed by Christine and Frieda. The live-tracking of the in vitro transcription was done by Max. The two softwares that were used in most subprojects were developed by Michael. Stefan worked on the verification of the software and the detection of molecules in high-throughput. The modeling for this and the life-tracking was performed by Stefan. Daniel, Hendrik, Tim and Michael worked on the twin ribozyme assay to repair the defekt CFTR-RNA. The cell culture setup was worked on by Stefan and Daniel.  Jasmin and Stefan designed the setup for the pulse-chase assay. Jasmin, Christine, Max and Tim organized the panel discussion. Tim and Lukas H. implemented the wiki. The progress of all projects has been discussed with the entire team and all instructors and advisors regularly.
Great thanks to the entire staff of the BioQuant for making our daily lab life a lot easier! We would also like to thank Jan Flessau for helping us with the animated videos, Silvan Schmitz for helping us with our design and Moritz Przybilla for cheering us up and for helpful discussions, Lara Schlegel for her cute drawings, Yassin Harim for quick and professional photography, Florian Schmidt for problem solving discussions and Konrad Herbst for his advice concerning cloning strategies. Oh, and of course stackoverflow.
We would like to thank all our supporters for explaining new techniques to us and for providing experience with the whole iGEM procedure. Thank you for believing in us, for asking the right questions and for encouraging us during the more difficult times.
In special, we want to thank AG Bishofs and AG Rippe for letting us use their GelDoc. Furthermore we want to thank Dr. Grimm and Julia Fakhiri for providing us with plasmids and advising us. We are thank AG Herten for providing the speedvac for our purposes and to Jürgen Beneke and Nina Beil for assistance in setting up the robot for us. Thanks a lot to Prof. Andres Jäschke, Gabriele Nübel, and Dr. Murat Sünbül for helping us during the initial planning, for their advice on aptamers and RNA work and for letting us use their equipement. We also want to express our gratitude towards Jens Wagner for providing us with equipment for the live streaming of our panel disscusion. Thanks to Matthias Bieg, Dr. Nagarajan Paramasivam, and Dr. Zuguang Gu for helping us to evaluate the next-gereration-sequencing data. AG Langowski helped us out with a Typhoon scanner, thanks for that. We are grateful for the allocation of the MALDI-TOF MS and the instruction by Wiebke Nadler. We want to say thank you to Dr. Damjana Kastelic for helping during initial planning and for giving us advice whenever we asked for it. Dr. Vladimir Benes helped us very much by putting the next-generation-sequencing on rush. During our software development we used JUG, thanks to Dr. Luis Pedro Coelho for elucidations and his help. Furthermore, we thank Dr. Suat Özbek for lending us the nanodrop for the summer and Navneethan Palanisamy for shooting  videos for us in India and Emer Hickey for shooting videos in Ireland for our video project.  In addition, we want to thank Darko Balke for advising us in Twin Ribozyme issues. We thank Prof. Marcus A. Mall for defining the disease of cystic fibrosis such as related subjects, for good scientific advice and for encouragement to bring our constructs into his specialized cell line. Especially we want to thank Dr. Julia Dürr, Johanna Salomo, and Heike Scheuermann who offered us their help with this cell line. Besides, a big thank you to two goups who provided us with purified proteins: Dr. Tamás Haraszti for purified actin and the group of Dr. Barbara Di Ventura for purified MinD-Δ10-His, MinE-His, Xylanase, Endoylsin-His, YEKJ-His and p53-His.

Some biologists have worked a lot in vivo, some chose to work in vitro. Three years ago Lukas chose to work in silico and moved to Karlsruhe so he could do his bachelor in Computer Science. Three years later, equipped with a B.Sc., he finally turned to the living parts of science, moved to Heidelberg and began to study Molecular Biotechnology. Fascinated by the combination of engineering and biology he became part of the iGEM Team Heidelberg 2015. Throughout the project he supported us with his immense knowledge about programming, yet also found some time to help in the lab. Also, without him, the Wiki would’ve been a static wasteland without all the cool features.
Christine is very reliable, honest and is always willing to lend a helping hand. She is great fun to be with and a fun-loving girl. Although she is very focused on her studies she also takes time off to relax and enjoy with her friends too. She is one of the most cheery people I have ever met - she is our sunshine in the lab- every time you look at her face there is a light smile on her lips. As our youngest team member she was totally excited to start in the wet lab and put in a lot of effort to get the CLICK reaction working. While relaxing from her subproject she loves to draw. It’s her hand you see in our Human Practice video and she also designed the poster for the discussion evening and created parts of the wiki drawings. As a healthy life style is very important to her, she eminently takes care not to contaminate others and herself with any bacteria or chemicals and always finds time to cook her lunch instead of eating in the canteen. She even drank Max’s power spinach smoothie, without flinching.
Max or better to say Mäxchen is mixing everything with spinach. He was particullary thrilled by the idea of providing the community with a variable toolbox to track biochemistry with spinach and spared no effort to develop one. This fits perfectly with his private passion of gardening. He grows everything in his garden and if there are no bees around he fertilizes his pumpkin plant manually. Besides all the spinach Max was involved in the human practice projects and organized together with Jasmine the discussion evening and managed the video project. If you asked Max about how important and how urgent the things he has to do in the next week are, he’d say having fun in the lab is very important but as he always had lots of fun working it wasn’t that urgent compared for example to ordering new primers. When working with Max you will learn about a lot, especially what new nicknames some got during the last couple of hour and how Taylor Swift is dancing.
The quiet working power. Whenever there was another cloning with issues she would work as hard as necessary to get it working or find hidden mistakes in ordered sequences. Even during the times when she worked single handedly on her subproject she invested every single minute she didn’t spent sleeping in the lab getting the project running. Next to pushing her project she also organized the discussion evening and especially was responsible to invited all the speaker. Being a member of the Human Practice committee she contributed many creative ideas regarding the video project and the poster design. Her wonderful western blotting skills were very valuable for the AptaBody project.
Day or night time… you’ll find Michael in the lab fighting the invasions of bugs but he always overcame every single one. If the team asked Michael if he wanted to join the rest for lunch or dinner he answered he’d happily join for breakfast. It happen rather often that if you left the lab at 10 or 11 pm and came back the following morning that Michael was still there coding. This might explain his breakfast habits. He takes his energy from salmiak and energy drinks. You can ask him for anything he’ll have a software to solve the issue. And if he came cheerful into the lab holding a microtiterplate in his hand everyone knew he came back from the plate reader and was able to confirm some of his in silico developed aptamer candidates in vitro.
Tim contributed to the team not only with his lab-skills but also with all this programming and wiki stuff I don’t understand. He was extremely important to the team and always was a person who              could calm everyone down when everything seemed to get crazy. If you needed help with anything              Tim was always there to help you.             Tim is passionate about science and technology, which is probably one of the many reasons why he              decided to join the igem-team this year. He is a charismatic, self-confident and determined person,              who will convince you that Dr. Who is one of the best series ever. He is the kind of person who knows              what he wants and who won't lose without a fight.              During his free time, he likes to watch series, play warhammer, plan revolutions, hang out with his              friends and… . Who are we kidding no one in iGEM has a whole lot of free time.
Daniel is one of the smallest members of our team ;) - but he dreams bigger than anyone else. His              capabilities of organizing and planning things has brought the team a lot forward. Besides, his              inexhaustible enthusiasm for the project not only helped him, but also others, even during tough              times.             Apart from organizing and working a lot in the CF-project and the AptaBody wet lab work, he was              working enthusiastically on the sponsoring. Using his very kind, yet indomitable way of convincing              people, he has gained us a lot of support of sponsors.             If not working until late night, Daniel does probably anything but sports … and mathematics. He is              very spontaneous and would never say no to an evening out or a round of laser tag, at least as              long as he can take his car there and no photos are taken ... like ... ever.
Frieda is definitely one of the most experienced members of the team, not only concerning the work with functional nucleic acids, but with labwork in general. Due to her experience from her bachelors thesis where she was working with DNAzymes, she brought a lot of expertise to the general planning of the project as well as the subproject she has been working on: the detection of small molecules such as rape drugs, and the readout. Her surname (Sorgenfrei) translates to worriless and naturally she gave her all to keep the entire team as far away from worries as possible, including both: pointing out that having fun in the lab is one of the most important things (including the wearing of colorful leggins) and aiding others to compromise disputes whenever possible. These two things earned her the nick name ""lab mom"" and it really accurately describes here care for the team and the project. Apart from the lab work of the Rape Drug detection subproject, Frieda was involved in the sponsoring and the development and experimental validation of the RFC.
Hendrik is an enthusiastic and skilled team member who is very fascinated with and captured by his tasks. Having a very good working morale and laboratory experience, he is spending most of the time working in the lab with cloning and transforming E.coli and his beloved competent yeast cells. He likes to spend his little spare time with some friends talking about his work. When it comes to cloning or transformations, he is the right person to ask for. During iGEM, he worked wholeheartedly for the CF project, even if that ment cloning of hundreds and hundreds of yeast samples. Although there is a pile of work to manage sometimes, Hendrik is a quite balanced and organized working partner with whom it can also make much fun to work. Besides iGEM, Hendrik studies Molecular Biotechnology, as most of the others in the team.
Stefan Holderbach             Stefan is, despite his young age, already an iGEM veteran - namely of the first iGEM High School              team from Heidelberg (2012). He is very helpful and obliging and shares his knowledge about              working in the lab with anyone who requires it.             As besides labwork, Stefan has a way with programming and software, he found his place in the              validation of the software screening 96-well plates with his newly found, robotic friend, as well as              modelling. Before having been drawn to the “dark side” (of dry lab work), he was furthermore              working on the Pulse-Chase project.             Apart from iGEM, Stefan is currently in the second semester of Molecular Biotechnology and trying              to write something weird about him would fill up this page completely. Besides, he is a highly              talented photographer of both, people and the beauty of nature, and can make (literally) anybody              look acceptable on photo."

Genetic Engineering Workshop by SPSingapore iGEM 2015
Introduction
The introduction of genetic engineering(GM) and synthetic biology to the layman has long been fraught with issues. Already, as evident from the organic and non-GM food movement, there exists a portion of the population that is distrustful of Genetic Engineering in their food, let alone for any medical treatment. As our project involves the use of a genetically engineered bacterial vector, this issue is of particular importance to our team.
We believe that this distrust stems from a misconception of synthetic biology amongst the general public; Genetic engineering is to many an almost mystical concept. It draws out terrifying images of science gone mad, of biologists tinkering with things far beyond their understanding. However, with the fundamental complexity of many synthetic biology concepts, their lack of understanding is somewhat understandable."

The main part of the project was finished by the 15 students from ZJU-China iGEM team. We 15 undergraduate students built the bio-bricks on our own including tcdA1, metK, Frr, orfX and so on. All of the CNC coating experiments as well as termite simulation experiments were done by students from ZJU-China. Owing to the effort we’ve made for outreach, we got the chance to collaborate with ZJSTM and made great preparation for human practice. We also performed some social research for human practice, we went to communities and areas where the termite problem is serious. All of the propaganda materials were designed by us such as the team uniforms, poly-cards, logo, mascot, name cards and many other art design materials like wiki, poster, banner and so on.

Special Thanks to Professor You-Jin Hwang , PI of Elan Vital Korea, who shared our belief of what we can do, and generously allowed us to use his lab, materials and other resources we needed.  He has been very supportive and understanding all the time, and offered invaluable advices whenever we needed them.
And, we cannot thank Dr. Jeffrey Hannah , our instructor, enough, however we tried.  He flew all the way to Korea and stayed with us for more than a week for brainstorming and valuable lectures on the fundamentals of synthetic biology for more than 80 hours.  He also opened our eyes on quorum sensing: what it is and what it can do. Our project idea is the brainchild of his works, contributions and guidance.  He led us to the idea, and directed our lab works throughout all processes.
Mr. Yeosung Moon and Ms Minji Lee helped us greatly as lab coaches.  Often, they had to sacrifice their freedom to stay with us, supervise and teach us lab techniques, and share their valuable experiences.
The following companies sponsored our works: TSST Global, Thinkware Dashcam, Tannus, and Daedong Paper. They helped us greatly reaching out to the community.  They generously helped us with funds for video creation and their products which we gave to visitors of our booth as gifts.
YMCA supported our project as our umbrella and guardian.  Without their help, we would not have been able to participate in the Korea Youth Expo.  Also they lend us their extensive network for our public awareness activities.
Mr. Sungchul Yoo , Secretary General of Korean Science Teacher Association, kindly distributed our information materials and videos to science teachers across Korea.
Mr. Chee Ho Yoon of Royal College of Art helped us to build an excellent team wiki with his artistic inspiration, devotion and years of experience.
Video editing and animation creation skills of Ms Heyeon Shim, Chaelyn Lee, Sodooeeeee (pen name, of course) have been invaluable for our videos.
Hotel Lotte kindly offered wonderful banquet and excellent ballroom for our regional meet-up.
June Kwon, Young Chan Kim’s mother, shared her past iGEM experience and served as a team secretary until we were able to stand on our feet.  And, last but not least, we have been greatly indebted to our parents whose financial and emotional support and inspiration made it all possible.  Thank you all; you made it all possible!"

MEET ELAN VITAL KOREA
Our team is a small number of people with complementary skills who are committed to
a common purpose, performance goals, and approach for which they hold themselves mutually accountable.
STUDENT MEMBERS
I’m Young Chan Kim.  I love the Big Bang Theory.  The drama, I mean.  When I’m not watching it, I read books, mostly science and math books.  It’s exciting, but it’s sad sometimes, to realize that they’ve got everything nailed down.  What am I supposed to contribute to the body of knowledge when they know everything?  Science should not be all about rote memorization and recitation, but about discovery and invention.
It’s my second time attending iGEM.  Last year, I researched one of the worst nightmares of humanity, MRSA.  It’s deadly bacteria as it acquired resistance to antibiotics.  If antibiotics are the fruit of heroic efforts to save humanity from disease and death, then antibiotic-resistant bacteria like MRSA are the Mother Nature’s reaction, the Nature Strikes Back.  Bacteria, like all other living organisms, evolves.  Humans evolve, too.  But, bacteria, by virtue of being so small and living so little, evolves a lot faster than bigger competitors like humans.  That’s why we have antibiotic-resistant bacteria.  So, it’s very Promethean, like endless swing between victory and defeat, heroism and tragedy.  (WHO seems to say a different story that we have them partly because no new antibacterial drug is invented after the discovery of Daptomycin in late 1980s.  That is, because scientists got lazy, but it’s a different story.)
It means the next antibiotic-resistant bacteria you encounter may not be the one that you’re familiar with.  It most likely have evolved since!  To recognize them in all of their evolutionary diversity, we must go deeper.  That’s what we did last year: find the DNA sequence that gives the bacteria the antibiotic-resistance.  This year, we took one step further: let a bacteria tell us if antibiotic-resistant bacteria is found in their neighborhood, using their own communication method, quorum sensing.  Isn’t it fascinating? That’s what I love about iGEM and synthetic biology.  You can actually make that happen!  You can make an E coli to report to us if they find any antibiotic-resistant bacteria in their neighborhood.  You create a life that does what you want!  It’s a brave new world!
In addition to being a zealous iGEMer, I am a senior at Stanford University Online High School.  Sometimes, you can find me playing viola, ice hockey or drawing pictures, but what you find of me in concert halls, ice hockey fields or atelier won’t excite you as much than in labs, libraries or even classrooms.  Not in a Sheldon or Leonard way like in the Big Bang Theory, mind you, but because I’m a man of curiosity, easily excited over small discoveries, delicious food and fun stories and happy just being with friends who understand each other.
My name is Soo Jung Lee. My whole life can be characterized by one word, “diversity”. It not only represents the diverse environment I was able to encounter since childhood, but also has been the driving force for all my past achievements.
Although I’ve lived all my life in South Korea, the open-mindedness with which I view the world stems from numerous overseas travel experiences in almost 20 different countries and the five years I spent at an international school. The early exposure to cultures and people from various countries had a profound impact on my life and also served as a basis for my decision to enroll in the international program at Hankuk Academy of Foreign Studies, a boarding school in Korea.
My interests cover a wide range of fields from academics to music, films and Baduk, but currently my major passion lies in mathematics and science. In math, I especially like algebra and geometry.
Complicated geometry problems can almost never be solved by a single-step calculation but once you reach a “Eureka” moment after staring into the figure for hours and applying every possible formula on it, the answer is just around the corner. Throughout my high school years, I represented Korea in many international competitions such as the IRML, WMTC and HMMT. In the 2015 HMMT, I led the Korean team as the captain and ranked individual 33rd, the first time ever for a Team Korea member to place in the top 50. Furthermore, I am a co-founder of the Korea Youth Math Association and am a member of the KGSEA Math Circle.
As for sciences, I have written 4 research papers, hold 3 patents, worked as an intern for 2 labs and won awards in numerous competitions. To name a few, I won the gold medal in the national round of the International Environmental Project Olympiad, and with that topic wrote a research paper and presented it at the ICEEA conference. Here I was the only student yet won the Best Paper Award.
While my interests in science were mostly focused on chemistry and physics, iGEM opened up a totally new scope for me. As a member participating in iGEM for the second time, I am grateful for both the professional knowledge and cooperative teamwork iGEM has provided. Synthetic biology is a newly emerging yet rapidly growing branch of science, and does not exist in nature yet creates mechanisms of life on Earth. My two consecutive years of iGEM led me to develop lab techniques that would otherwise never have been acquired until years later. This experience is also the main motive behind my hopes of majoring in biomedical engineering. My past two years would have been incomplete without iGEM, and I am grateful for making an end to high school with iGEM.
I'm Hyun Min Park. I would like to term myself with the word ‘diversity’ as I am interested in various fields not only in science but also in engineering and liberal arts. And also have diverging characteristics.
I am an easy­going student who loves to play basketball after school, loves to read books whenever time is available, and loves to take a nice cozy nap Huat lunch break.
However I am a person with enthusiasm when necessary. I am a passionate debater who never gives up; I am a person who respects logic, law and justice. And I am an active participant in group project.
I’m a senior who is willing to dedicate myself to upcoming events of IGEM and further research of this remarkable field known as ‘synthetic biology’. To be honest, I haven’t had a chance to deal with such field until I met my outstanding teammates who were already quite familiar with synthetic biology, and lacked knowledge. But the research we have conducted meant so much to me as a first complicated bio­lab experiment that I indulged myself into. It was interesting. I even considered it as my future career.
The past few months in participating in the team were valuable to be and I am willing make progress in our research.
My name is Sophie Lee and I am a member of the Elan Viatal IGEM team of South Korea. I am currently a senior at Miss Porter’s School, located in Farmington, Connecticut.
My main intellectual interests are in literature, social sciences, and languages, and I am seeking to study clinical psychology in the future. To me, science and social sciences seemed like very different fields that have an impermeable wall between them for a long time.
However, I eventually realized that in order to study psychology, I needed to gain research skills as well. Science and social sciences could be interdisciplinary. I had become interested in science through chemistry and biology, and I thought I would bring in what I learned in those science courses into the social sciences area, which is why I decided to participate in the 2015 IGEM competition. Research skills and the ability to conduct experiments are crucial to the study of psychology. I could use all aspects of my interests in different fields of study to enhance my future aspirations.
IGEM has been a valuable experience to me. I was able to work in a real laboratory environment and learn how to work with my teammates to work through hardships. I also discovered that science could be applied to people’s lives directly in the name of human development. I hope to use what I have gained as a participant in the 2015 IGEM competition to fulfill my goals in the future.
My name is Ji Hoon Kang. Since I was young, book has been good friend of mine. Through diverse books, Icould have learn knowledges in various fields, and also learn to think “critically”, while comparing my one opinion to that of the authors.
Developing this ability for years, I was able to get into the Global Leader Program at Bugil Academy. This program was the place where I was enable to boost my critical thinking ability, with rigorous everyday discussion­based classes, such as Argumentation & Ethics and AP European History, and diverse extracurricular activities, including Model United Nations club and investment club. With these experiences in high school, I believe that I have gained some knowledges in Sociology.
However, I hardly had any chances to apply my critical thinking ability in science fields. It was Team Elan Vital that offered me a chance to achieve my aspiration, while I was lamenting my lack of knowledges in science fields.
With this experience, I was able to gain overflowing knowledges about how bio­labs are conducted, and also the importance of well structured design in terms of experiments.
Although I am not an expert in Biology unlike all other teammates are, I believe, or, hope, that I had contributed to the team with endless yearnings for knowledge and effort. Again, I would like to thank all my team members for their hard work in the project.
My name is Brittany Lee and I am currently a sophomore at Yongsan International School of Seoul. During my spare time I enjoy listening to music as it helps me relieve my stress and let out my emotions. I also really enjoy taking long walks in the city as there are so many beautiful places in Seoul. Another passion of mine is traveling. While living in Hong Kong for three years, I had a chance to visit many unique places. I love seeing new locations and people.
Ever since I first encountered the subject of biology in 8th grade I have been interested in various areas of biology. I was introduced to iGEM by a friend that I have been friends with for over 10 years and I am very glad she told me about this opportunity.
When our team first met all together, I felt very awkward because we all go to different schools and have never met each other before. However, as we spent more time with each other we got a lot closer. The members were all very welcoming and helpful in many ways. Although the long lab sessions and meetings were tiring, I'm glad I joined because I was able to gain knowledge and many new friends.
Like I mentioned above, I love going to new locations and meeting new people. IGEM has been able to give me joy in those areas. I have never been to Boston so I am looking forward to it!
My name is Nu Ri Choi. I’m a sophomore who likes not just biology and science, but also football and rock music. I’m a big fan of Manchester United and Eintracht Frankfurt, the first of which I have been supporting since I was nine, and has been the cause for much passion and joy. As of for music, I love the Foo Fighters and Lifehouse. I love playing guitar, which I’ve been playing casually as a hobby since I was in sixth grade.
I also am an avid debater, and I will represent Korea at the National Speech and Debate Association Summer Tournament in 2016, as well as coming in the top three in numerous national tournaments.
Currently I live in Seongnam, Korea, a suburban city in the vicinity of the capital Seoul, where I go to school. Before that I lived in the Philippines, where I attended Brent International School of Manila, which helped me adjust not only to a world of different cultures and people, but also to an English­based education. Having spent my whole life international school, I’ve studied a more American­style curriculum of science, and I believe that has helped me get a lot more exposure to the science I needed to know in order to contribute to this project.
I’ve been studying biology for about three years now, and I started preparing for iGEM since last August, meeting up with other teammates at the lab and getting some hands­on experience.
Learning synthetic biology was something new and amazing for me, and the concept of modifying life was fascinating. I’m looking forward to participating in iGEM this year, and I hope that our group not only does well but also learns a lot from this experience.
My name is Seungmeen Choi. I am a member of the Elan Vital 2015 Korean Science Research Team. I am a freshman currently attending Seoul Foreign School. I am the youngest member of the team. My favorite hobby is photography. This is why I took a role as a photographer for the team. When I first joined the team, I felt very uncomfortable. This was because I was the youngest and I didn’t know how to start a conversation. However as time went by, the awkwardness faded away as my team members took care of me and started talking to me.
I did not have a lot of experience and knowledge in molecular biology when I first joined the team. However, throughout the course of experiments and research, I have accumulated a lot of knowledge throughout the year with my teammates and instructors.
I joined this club in August 2014 because of a recommendation from a previous member of iGEM last year. Coincidentally, the night before I was given the option to join the team, I had a dream where I ate a lot of medicine because I was sick. To me, this path seemed like destiny.
Being a part of ‘Elan Vital’ was a choice, which I took, and I don’t regret it at all. During the course of completing the project, many sacrifices were made but it was worth it on the long run. I feel like I have acquired a lot of social and scientific knowledge.
My name is Soo Ji Lee. I can introduce myself with two things: a violin and books. Since I was 8, I have played the violin. With a lot of effort, now I can play it well, so I usually relieve my stress by playing the violin. And I also love to read books and it became the motive energy to be curious to various fields, such as history, literature, science and math. I got a huge amount of background knowledge through books and it became a big help to me when I participated to the Igem-project as a member.
Unlike other members, I have never been to foreign countries or international school. So this project was another challenge for me. Though I have learned and used English since I was young, but I had more difficulties compared to other members. And what I have learned through the books supported me in many ways. It was easy for me to learn about bio-labs and I could understand this project exactly. So I could figure out the solution when our team faced the difficulties.
This project gave me an unforgettable memory. I did the lab experience for the first time, and I had some great team members whom I work with in the lab. I could cooperate with them by sharing each one's idea. This experience taught me not only scientific knowledge but also the methods how I can work with other members by communicating with each other. Though there were tough moments, but every moment was a priceless time to me.

When I first encountered iGem, I was very delighted for the existence of this wonderful community. As a scientist and professor, I am keenly aware of the great potential of synthetic biology for the well­being of humanity. I am very pleased to see that my team, Elan Vital, consistently shows enthusiasm and dedication to the research project, which can be difficult for the high school students. I believe than this is the first step for them to grow to be good scientists who have great heart and sharp technology as well as intellectual discipline. I feel rewarded to witness their growth throughout the process of lab experimentation and research activities. Also, I am impressed with their interests in the society demonstrated in the works of their human practice.

Research skills and the ability to conduct experiments are crucial to the study of psychology. I could use all aspects of my interests in different fields of study to enhance my future aspirations.
IGEM has been a valuable experience to me. I was able to work in a real laboratory environment and learn how to work with my teammates to work through hardships. I also discovered that science could be applied to people’s lives directly in the name of human development. I hope to use what I have gained as a participant in the 2015 IGEM competition to fulfill my goals in the future.
Soo Jung Lee
My whole life can be characterized by one word, “diversity”. It not only represents the diverse environment I was able to encounter since childhood, but also has been the driving force for all my past achievements.
Although I’ve lived all my life in South Korea, the open-mindedness with which I view the world stems from numerous overseas travel experiences in almost 20 different countries and the five years I spent at an international school. The early exposure to cultures and people from various countries had a profound impact on my life and also served as a basis for my decision to enroll in the international program at Hankuk Academy of Foreign Studies, a boarding school in Korea.
My interests cover a wide range of fields from academics to music, films and Baduk, but currently my major passion lies in mathematics and science. In math, I especially like algebra and geometry.
Complicated geometry problems can almost never be solved by a single-step calculation but once you reach a “Eureka” moment after staring into the figure for hours and applying every possible formula on it, the answer is just around the corner. Throughout my high school years, I represented Korea in many international competitions such as the IRML, WMTC and HMMT. In the 2015 HMMT, I led the Korean team as the captain and ranked individual 33rd, the first time ever for a Team Korea member to place in the top 50. Furthermore, I am a co-founder of the Korea Youth Math Association and am a member of the KGSEA Math Circle.
As for sciences, I have written 4 research papers, hold 3 patents, worked as an intern for 2 labs and won awards in numerous competitions. To name a few, I won the gold medal in the national round of the International Environmental Project Olympiad, and with that topic wrote a research paper and presented it at the ICEEA conference. Here I was the only student yet won the Best Paper Award.
While my interests in science were mostly focused on chemistry and physics, iGEM opened up a totally new scope for me. As a member participating in iGEM for the second time, I am grateful for both the professional knowledge and cooperative teamwork iGEM has provided. Synthetic biology is a newly emerging yet rapidly growing branch of science, and does not exist in nature yet creates mechanisms of life on Earth. My two consecutive years of iGEM led me to develop lab techniques that would otherwise never have been acquired until years later. This experience is also the main motive behind my hopes of majoring in biomedical engineering. My past two years would have been incomplete without iGEM, and I am grateful for making an end to high school with iGEM.
Ji Hoon Kang
Since I was young, book has been good friend of mine. Through diverse books, Icould have learn knowledges in various fields, and also learn to think “critically”, while comparing my one opinion to that of the authors.
Developing this ability for years, I was able to get into the Global Leader Program at Bugil Academy. This program was the place where I was enable to boost my critical thinking ability, with rigorous everyday discussion­based classes, such as Argumentation & Ethics and AP European History, and diverse extracurricular activities, including Model United Nations club and investment club. With these experiences in high school, I believe that I have gained some knowledges in Sociology.
However, I hardly had any chances to apply my critical thinking ability in science fields. It was Team Elan Vital that offered me a chance to achieve my aspiration, while I was lamenting my lack of knowledges in science fields.
With this experience, I was able to gain overflowing knowledges about how bio­labs are conducted, and also the importance of well structured design in terms of experiments.
Although I am not an expert in Biology unlike all other teammates are, I believe, or, hope, that I had contributed to the team with endless yearnings for knowledge and effort. Again, I would like to thank all my team members for their hard work in the project.
Young Chan Kim
I’m Young Chan Kim. I love the Big Bang Theory. The drama, I mean. When I’m not watching it, I read books, mostly science and math books. It’s exciting, but it’s sad sometimes, to realize that they’ve got everything nailed down. What am I supposed to contribute to the body of knowledge when they know everything? Science should not be all about rote memorization and recitation, but about discovery and invention.
It’s my second time attending iGEM. Last year, I researched one of the worst nightmares of humanity, MRSA. It’s deadly bacteria as it acquired resistance to antibiotics. If antibiotics are the fruit of heroic efforts to save humanity from disease and death, then antibiotic-resistant bacteria like MRSA are the Mother Nature’s reaction, the Nature Strikes Back. Bacteria, like all other living organisms, evolves. Humans evolve, too. But, bacteria, by virtue of being so small and living so little, evolves a lot faster than bigger competitors like humans. That’s why we have antibiotic-resistant bacteria. So, it’s very Promethean, like endless swing between victory and defeat, heroism and tragedy. (WHO seems to say a different story that we have them partly because no new antibacterial drug is invented after the discovery of Daptomycin in late 1980s. That is, because scientists got lazy, but it’s a different story.)
It means the next antibiotic-resistant bacteria you encounter may not be the one that you’re familiar with. It most likely have evolved since! To recognize them in all of their evolutionary diversity, we must go deeper. That’s what we did last year: find the DNA sequence that gives the bacteria the antibiotic-resistance. This year, we took one step further: let a bacteria tell us if antibiotic-resistant bacteria is found in their neighborhood, using their own communication method, quorum sensing. Isn’t it fascinating? That’s what I love about iGEM and synthetic biology. You can actually make that happen! You can make an E coli to report to us if they find any antibiotic-resistant bacteria in their neighborhood. You create a life that does what you want! It’s a brave new world!
In addition to being a zealous iGEMer, I am a senior at Stanford University Online High School. Sometimes, you can find me playing viola, ice hockey or drawing pictures, but what you find of me in concert halls, ice hockey fields or atelier won’t excite you as much than in labs, libraries or even classrooms. Not in a Sheldon or Leonard way like in the Big Bang Theory, mind you, but because I’m a man of curiosity, easily excited over small discoveries, delicious food and fun stories and happy just being with friends who understand each other."

We didn't know iGEM until April,2015,so this is our first time to attend this famous, international competition. Because of the narrow schedule, Ruicheng and Junhao tried their best to apply fund supports from the College of Plant Protection and other administrative departments of Fujian Agriculture University (FAFU). And we are very grateful to receive the first fund support ($4000) to register the FAFU-CHINA team, which approved by FAFU vice-president, professor Wenxiong Lin. Meanwhile, we are very thankful to get help from Ms. Xiuhui Li, the vice-director of Office of Educational Administration. What’s more, our English teacher Penny offered potential help during our registration of the team. Without their help, our iGEM team would still be a plan.
After the establishment of team, Prof. Zujian Wu helped us with the experiment plan. Besides, Prof. Wu tried to help us get fund and academic help. He recommended Prof. Xiaolei Huang to be a co-instructor of the team. Prof. Huang helped to establish our team by his abundant teamwork experience. Meanwhile, he supervised the whole process of our project and helped us finish each part before deadlines. During the project, Prof. Bingfeng Zhou and Prof. Taiyun Wei offered necessary biology materials, respectively, including bees, honey, and virus. Without their help in academic and organization, we would not be able to complete our project on time.
Our team members are with different abilities and backgrounds, which is good to our project. Changlong Lu and Ruicheng Dai completed the experiments. As seniors, they often introduced advanced biological technologies to other freshmen team members. Zhili Lai joined FAFU-CHINA team because of the publicity from Junhao Lu.
Lai has strong abilities to solve kinds of problems. Besides experiments, he was mainly responsible for presentation and outreach of our work. Liangdi Chen contributed a lot in designing the logo of our team, posters and wiki. Meanwhile, Tong Tong, Mucheng Cai, Zirui Chen, Yifan Tang, Tengzhou Huang, Mengnan Li provided their contribution in several tasks, such as publicity, interview, human practice and so on.

Attributions and Acknowledgements:
The 2015 Exeter iGEM team has been supported, advised, and generally guided in the right direction by scientists of various disciplines, and industry professionals. We would like to thank every person who contributed to the project, no matter how significant or small the contribution.
Supervisors
Our supervisors were always there to guide us, encourage us, and provide constructive feedback to the team. They organised the foundation of our iGEM experience and supported us with an informed perspective on our ambitious concepts. A huge thanks to:
Dr Thomas Howard - Shell Open Innovation Independent Research Fellow, advised us with our project ideas and putting us in contact with relevant academics, as well as general modelling assistance. Tom was always around, helping us out with all aspects of the project - in fact, there’s not much he didn’t do for us!
Dr Paul James - Research Fellow, aided us in the lab and with operating various specialist equipment, and was a huge help in organising the iGEM itinerary. Paul advised us on everything and anything lab-related and guided the team with all aspects of the project.
Dr Elizabeth James - Associate Lecturer and Associate Research Fellow, was alway there to help us out with organising the outreach side of the project, target setting, finances, and general admin.
Dr John Love - Professor of Synthetic Biology, and our iGEM coordinator, guided the team and officiated much of the project. Without him, we wouldn’t be an iGEM team!
Dr Christine Sambles - Research Fellow, guided our ideas from the start and, in particular, gave us insightful advice on bioinformatics and using the NUPACK program.
Advisors
We were also helped through the project by our advisors, who gave us technical guidance and help in the laboratory at every step of the project. Many thanks to:
Ryan Edginton, Postgraduate Research and Exeter iGEM alumni, advised the team on time management, wiki construction, and general iGEM insight. He also put the team in contact with some academics within the university.
Dr Anja Nenninger - Postdoctoral Researcher, was enthusiastic and supportive throughout the project, and had some invaluable advice on laboratory techniques. We’d like to thank her for letting us use her buffers, ladders and, on more than one occasion, her bunsen burner!
Ross Kent - Molecular Biologist, was knowledgeable and understanding whilst we developed our skills and techniques in the Mezzanine laboratory, and had insightful advice on the technical parts of the project.
Dr Charlotte Cook -  Postdoctoral Researcher, forwarded us relevant papers to read, provided us with specialist knowledge and assistance on cell free systems and dealing with RNA. We’d like to thank her for exchanging equipment with us - notably cell free kits & competent cells - so that we could get all our lab work done on time!
The Mezzanine Lab
We would like to thank the rest of the Mezzanine laboratory researchers for not only sharing their lab space, equipment, and materials with our team, but guiding and advising us on the technical aspects of the project. Many thanks to:
Dagmara Kolak - Mezzanine Laboratory Manager, trained us in basic laboratory skills and etiquette during the laboratory induction, and was always there to help us with general lab advice when we were at a loss!
Dr Chloe Singleton - Associate Research Fellow, offered us specialist advice on dealing with unstable RNA, and general laboratory guidance. She also helped coordinate the arrival and setup of our microplate reader.
Jamie Gilman - Postgraduate Researcher, offered us specialist laboratory advice, assisted and allowed us to use the robotic pipetter.
Richard Tennant - Postgraduate Researcher, assisted us with running FACS and Imagestream for our Interlab extra credit.
And to the rest of the Mezzaniners - thank you for putting up with us!
Human Practices Contacts
We contacted various other experts in the area of bovine T.B., and were privileged enough to be able to meet many of them in person as Devon is an area severely affected by the disease and so many bovine T.B. experts work here. Many thanks to:
Michael Ross of Saved and Safe, a company dealing with animal health, offered his guidance and contacts to the team. Michael is an expert in bovine TB management and was enthusiastic in pushing the outreach side of the project to go out and meet farmers and vets.
Phil Leighton is a local vet working for XL Farmcare. We hosted him at the university - his practical knowledge of TB testing in the field was eye-opening for the team and informed the design of our prototype TB test. He also offered us the opportunity to visit a farm and observe TB testing, which we gladly took up.
Richard Sibley is another local vet we have met with on several occasions. He has over 30 years of experience and runs myhealthyherd.co.uk, a tool designed for farmers and vets to help reduce disease among livestock. He provided an insight into the effects of bovine TB on both farmers and vets, and guided the design of our prototype TB test with practical knowledge.
George Eustice - MP for Camborne, Redruth, and Hayle, and appointed Minister of State at DEFRA, met with us in August to discuss the impact and awareness of bovine TB in the UK. We enjoyed meeting him and discussing the Ribonostics project.
General Acknowledgements
And finally, we received help from many sources inside and out of the university and would like to acknowledge all that guided, advised, and generally dealt with us. Many thanks to:
Jonathan Fieldsend is a computer scientist based at the university, he helped on our project by offering advice and guidance on our model. His input was gained through numerous meetings and had vastly shaped how our model looks and works. In the first meeting we had with him we changed the coordinate generation, plotting facility and completely restructured our code into functions. This was all included to speed up and make our code more efficient. In following meetings he offered more specific advice to improve it even further. We now have a model capable of providing a visual simulation and numerical output.
Marian Littlejohn provided feedback and guidance on the graphic design aspect of the project, as well as general advice about our wiki.
Natalie Garrett was kind enough to take our team and individual photographs, even at the top of the biosciences building on a windy day!
Oliver Carney, Applications Specialist, and Sarah Dickinson, Product Specialist, of BMG Labtech delivered and set up the FLUOstar Omega microplate reader. They were patient and understanding with the lab team during the setup and demonstration of the microplate reader we were kindly lent by BMG Labtech. Their in-depth explanation of the device and promise of continued support was much appreciated.
Peter Winlove, offered various support and advice throughout the project. This included a detailed meeting discussing the rate constant of our toehold system, and the design of our prototype.
Paul Hughes of Galloways Ltd., who printed our free business cards in record time - a generous offer and one we very much appreciated in the final weeks of the project!
Dale Cook of Affinity, who provided us with a copy of Affinity Designer,  a fast, clean piece of graphics software. We relied on the program for most of our graphical work, and are extremely grateful to Dale for his generosity.
Attributions within the team:
A huge strength of our team is its interdisciplinary nature; having biologists, physicists, natural scientists, and biochemists allowed us to tackle the problem of bTB from different perspectives. We harnessed the diverse nature of our team and gave equal weighting to the three main areas of the project: the lab work, the modelling work, and the outreach (human practices) side of the project. Although every team member had input in all sections of the project, each of us had preferences in the area in which we worked. These are briefly outlined:
Todd, Amy, Dan, and David worked on the modelling section of the project. This included creating a simulation of our system with complex toehold-trigger interactions in a 3D environment, researching real world values for properties such as binding distances, viscosities, temperatures, etc., and solving problems such as confinement into a low binding affinity microcentrifuge tube.
We were all present in the laboratory at various stages of the project but the key laboratory members were Bradley, Emilia, Jasmine, Georgina and Joe. Lab duties included making up antibiotic plates and glycerol stocks (using liquid nitrogen), using the FLUOstar Omega microplate reader to gain accurate quantitative fluorescence readings, and running and extracting agarose gels.
Bradley, Emilia, Jasmine, and Georgina were all involved in toehold research and design during the early stages of the project. This included searching for a piece of target RNA present in a Mycobacterium bovis infection but not present in the BCG vaccine, and using tools such as NUPACK and UGENE to design a toeholds with a variety of chromoproteins and other markers. Yemi also created a detailed schematic of TB infection.
A small team comprised of David, Todd, and Rachel worked on the wiki design and implementation. This included coding, scripting, and styling the wiki, as well as designing layouts, templates, and making the carousel on the main page. In particular, Todd scripted the sliding logo in the navigation menu.
Joe, Yemi, and Amy handled the outreach side of the project - a monumental task. Their duties included meeting with various farmers, vets, and any other people involved with bovine TB in our local area and beyond. Their research informed our project and experimental design and proved invaluable to prototype design. In addition, Joe was in charge of creating a video to raise awareness of bovine TB in the local area,  and Yemi was responsible for organizing public events, such as school presentations, to introduce the local community to the potential of synthetic biology.
A lab team composed of Bradley, Emilia, Jasmine, Georgina and Joe tackled the interlab study we volunteered to take part in. This included procedures such as miniprep, ligation, transformation, preparing overnight cultures, digestion, and sequencing.
Joe, Amy, Dan, and Bradley were all very involved in graphic design and produced some high-grade work including the TB infographic (by Amy), the carousel slides (various contributors), and an article (by Joe). Rachel and David contributed to layout design of wiki templates, presentations, and other such documents. Dan made some intricate graphics for the presentation. Georgina and Jasmine designed our Exeter stash for Boston - hoodies and t-shirts.
The presentation material was worked on as a team with some long nights involved! The main design was thought up as a group, building on the work Amy had done in her infographic. The implementation of this design was undertaken by Todd using the Affinity software kindly provided. This included making standard designs for the banner, poster and presentation. Todd and Dan put some hard work into writing our official abstract and title.
Our project involved much collaboration, and various members of our team were in contact with other iGEM teams. Emilia was communicating with the Bielefeld iGEM team by coordinating Skype calls and email exchanges. Dan and Rachel contacted Oxford iGEM to discuss modelling and collaboration. We all attended the UK iGEM meetup hosted by iGEM Westminster , where Bradley, Todd, Dan, and Yemi presented. Joe managed the Exeter iGEM twitter account , (as well as other social media)  which resulted in a group skype of several teams, including iGEM Warwick , iGEM Manchester , and iGEM Sydney . Joe also sent an article to be published in a newsletter arranged by iGEM Amoy . In fact, Joe was a real hero on the collaborations part of the project and lead most of our Skype meetings with other teams, as well as being in charge of the team diary.
Our presentation in Boston is to be presented by Joe, Dan, and Todd. We wish them luck and all the best!

Meet RHIT's 2015 iGEM Team!
RHIT is an institution dedicated to undergraduate education in the STEM fields. The iGEM team at RHIT was started by Dr. Ric Anthony in 2012. It was inspired by two exciting synthetic biology seminar courses that Dr. Anthony offered during the prior academic year.
The 2015 RHIT iGEM team consists of four undergraduate students from the Biology and Biomedical Engineering department. Read each team member’s individual biography below!
Dani Bauhan
Dani is a member of the graduating Class of 2016, an active member of Chi Omega, and the Historian and Events Coordinator of RHIT's Tri Beta chapter. She is a Biology and Biochemistry & Molecular Biology double major from Indiana, and is excited for Graduate School to focus on Molecular Biology. She enjoys long nights in the lab, a good micro-pipette, and when transformations work the first time. She was the student leader of the team, and guided the team with her experience from the 2014 competition.
Chris Kibler
Chris is a Biomedical Engineer graduating in 2017. Originally from Illinois, he is a member of the varsity soccer team and a member of the Biomedical Engineering Society. Along with soccer, he likes to work out, go skydiving, and hopes to get into paintballing. His goal is to work in the Bioinstrumentation field upon graduation. His contribution to the team included development of the Wiki and work with documentation.
Mike Plaskett
Mike is a Biology major graduating in 2017.  Hailing from Indiana, he hopes to pursue a degree in Pharmacy after his time at Rose.  Mike is an active member of the school’s Alpha Chi Sigma and Tri Beta Chapters.  His many passions include virology, immunology, the Chicago Bears, and video games.  In the lab, he was mainly involved in making media and assisting in protocols such as digests and transformations.
Nick Edwards
Nick is a Biology and Biochemistry & Molecular Biology double major from Columbus, Indiana and plans to graduate in 2017. He hopes to enter a MD/PhD program and perform clinical research. Outside of academics, Nick is the vice president of service of the Alpha Phi Omega chapter at Rose-Hulman, and is also a member in Alpha Chi Sigma and Tri Beta. His contributions include reviewing primary literature and assisting Dani in the lab on occasion, as well as designing the graphics used by the team.
Dr.Ric Anthony

""Synthetic biology has the potential to address many of humanity's grand challenges. iGEM provides rich opportunities to foster creative and critical thinking skills, and an aptitude for interdisciplinary collaboration and team work, which are essential to realizing the discipline's full potential. I find it invigorating to be involved in such a worthy endeavor.""
Dr.David Goulet
Dr. Goulet teaches and studies mathematical biology. His research interests are in cellular and molecular biology and biochemistry. He’s an avid rock climber and is the faculty advisor for the Rose-Hulman rock climbing club.
""Biological systems often exhibit immense complexity and richness of behavior. The power of applied mathematics lies in its diverse set of tools capable of describing, analyzing, and making predictions regarding the behavior of complex systems. In this sense, synthetic biology is a vast and fascinating playground for applied mathematicians. I’m proud and excited to participate in iGEM. It gives me a chance to foster the development of the next generation of mathematically aware synthetic biologists."""

Our Team!
Hi, my name is Caroline! I love doing web lab work and helping with the team's graphic design. Outside of iGEM, I spend my time playing board games and sewing biology-inspired quilts.
Hi, I’m James. I’m a chemical engineering major aspiring to become a synthetic biologist. When I first read about BioBricks, I wondered what it would be like to design some myself. This summer I found out, and it was worth the eleven year wait.
Hi my names Sameer! You can find me protesting against paternalistic paradigms of medicine or wearing patterned shirts scuttling around campus. This is my second year of iGEM and I still haven’t contracted enterocolitis…yet.
Hello, my name is Joshua. You can identify me as the shortest member on the team. I'm also an aspired mainstream hipster, who own a fixie bike, Chrome backpack, and some Levi's 511 jeans. (Definitely should've shaved for the picture.)
Hi, I am Linyang Ju (Andrew), an MCB junior. In addition to eating a hearty meal during a long PCR, I also love to feed those bacterium that cry the most piteously for food and generate electricity to push bands in gel to the correct site.
Hello, my name is Noah. I love long walks on the beach holding hands with the eternal love of my life and listening as the waves crash against sandy beaches tucked within the expanses of my imagination as I day dream through class.
Hello, I'm Miranda Dawson. I helped with wet lab work and organized our outreach project.  Outside of iGEM, I binge watch reality television and indulge in overpriced coffee drinks.
My name is Arudhir (Aru) Singh, I am a junior in Engineering Physics with a minor in running PCRs. iGEM has provided me invaluable experience and knowledge in the field of synthetic biology.
Hello, I’m Pierce! I am a sophomore in Bioengineering with a focus on tissue engineering and cancer research. I am a Daniel Radcliffe wannabe and I aspire to one day grow a real beard.
Hello, my name is Ashwin Pillai. I enjoy short walks on the beach and mango smoothies. I hope to work for the CDC one day. I've learned an immense amount from IGEM and I hope to use this knowledge in the field of immunology.

Media
Communication
During the entire year, our team did its best to get people interested in Synthetic Biology. The first step to reach this goal was to inform people of the project’s information and progresses through social networks such as Facebook, Twitter and YouTube. Then, the promoted the project among people during public events such as Vinexpo (Largest international wine Congress) in Bordeaux. At these events, the team relied on flyers and a brochure to give people the objectives and the principle of Cur’dVine. The flyer we use is represented just below:  FLYER
To make people aware of the iGEM competition and to make them know our project, the team has led interviews with Bordeaux Sciences Museum, Cap Science. For more details, please look at our Policy and Practices page.
Press
All the team’s efforts have been noticed by the media in Bordeaux. It had been the case of U, the magazine of Bordeaux University, who published a paper on us on July 2015.

The C.elegans Tamer !!!!
Denis Dupuy was born in Pau, France. As a young man in Pau, Denis studied Biology at University of Pau with the hopes of becoming a career scientist by day and a Superhero by night, so he decided to do what it was necessary to accomplish his dreams. A remarkable student, he later landed his first postdoctoral dream job at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute of Boston. These dreams, however, were soon shattered when a near-fatal C.elegans accident left him without superpower. During his recuperation at Bordeaux in the U869 INSERM team, Denis heard about an International Student Synthetic Biology Competition : iGEM. Suddenly, it is the revelation, he cannot save people with his superpower. From that moment he decided to create the first Bordeaux team (like Professor Xavier in X-men), and trained some young aspiring biologists to make the world a better place. Soon, he discovered a new passion that took over his life... Denis developed a talent for PCR that was often copied, though never rivaled.

Collaborations
sharing and collaboration are core values of iGEM. We encourage you to reach out and work with other teams on difficult problems that you can more easily solve together. You can work with any other team in the competition, including software, hardware, high school and other tracks. You can also work with non-iGEM research groups, but they do not count towards the iGEM team collaboration gold medal criterion. In order to meet the gold medal criteria on helping another team, you must complete this page and detail the nature of your collaboration with another iGEM team. Here are some suggestions for projects you could work on with other teams:      Improve the function of another team's BioBrick Part or Device     Characterize another team's part     Debug a construct     Model or simulating another team's system     Test another team's software     Help build and test another team's hardware project     Mentor a high-school team

Feifan Xu
My name is Feifan Xu, a junior student. It is my great honor to become part of iGEM LZU-China 2015. To be honest, I am a diffident guy more or less. So work like electrophoresis PCR or other molecule experiment are quite suitable for me. My primary job is parts construction. Besides that, the measurement of part expression quantity and a little MFC work is also my duty. I like swim in my free time. I love computer games too. After the experiment of the passing year, I find out a truth. The only failure is give up, if you keep fighting, hope is coming.

We as a team were working in the same laboratory as the San_Andres and EMILIA URRUTIA ; We supported each other and while we were not working as a team all helped us to make our projects achieve arise from the idea.
the last team that we got to know was the team UChile-OpenBio and they helped us in the last days of laboratory.
Our project was based on helping the miners, but until we decide to us by this idea we investigated various issues and problems. Then we do a rain of ideas in which the winning groups and groups that were in the home, gathered and commented on it.
This occurred to us working with silica. It was the most promising;  because it covers a social problem of national and international. Then be discussed it to our teacher and teacher assistant, which supported us to follow."

Hi there! We are tight knit group of passionate undergrads from Sydney, Australia. Without further ado let's introduce the team.

Undergraduates
Rhys Keirle
G'day I'm Rhys, nice to meet you. I’m currently in my third year of a Science degree majoring in Biotechnology. Outside of uni I am a keen traveler, with plans to get my skis on in Japan later this year. I also have a passion for gymnastics and coach on a regular basis, with a little training, competition and judging on the side. See you in Boston!
Manan Shah
You would not be able to guess that about 3 and a half years ago I said that ""I would never do science at university"" considering all I talk about now is science. I am now a 3rd year Advanced Science student majoring in Molecular and Cell Biology. To minimise the non-science part of my life, or what some people would call a social life, I decided to do iGEM! As part of the team, I have mainly been in the lab and have been working on the wiki.
Kristen Perry
I’m a third year Advanced Science student majoring in Pathology, enjoying a little molecular biology adventure on the side. iGEM has been such an interesting opportunity for me and I’m incredibly thankful for the support our team has received thus far. When I’m not in the lab (or pretending to know how to design things), I love to hike, climb and canyon.
Mackenzie Labine-Romain
Hi I’m Mac and I’m in my last year of an Adv. Sci. Biotechnology and Microbiology degree. I have a debilitating fear of free time, so thought iGEM would be perfect for me. Turns out I was right!!! On a serious note, learning more about synthetic biology has drastically expanded my repertoire of science-based puns and pick up lines, and for this I am grateful… “Girl, are you E. coli? Because you’re a model organism.”
Isabelle Capell-Hattam
When Isabelle was 8 her mum banned her from doing science experiments in the kitchen. Now that she's moved out she does science where ever she feels like (though mostly in the lab)- take that mum. I'm a 3rd year Adv. Sci. Molecular and Cell Biology major who has dabbled a bit with cholesterol regulation. I'm not really sure what role I play on the UNSW iGEM team, but I'm pretty darn good at making people use positive and negative controls. For the month of September I have survived off coffee and sour straps, it takes great fuel to fuel great minds.
Benjamin Jones
Ben was a 2nd year B. Med Sci. student at UNSW and aspired to be a doctor. From the get go Ben was super keen to get involved and brought along an infectious enthusiasm to the group. One of his favourite ideas for iGEM was to further investigate the potential of the Type 3 secretion system (T3SS) for use in human therapies, something he had previously worked on with Dr Lawrence Lee at the Victor Chang Center for Cardiac research. Tragically, on the 2nd of April 2015 Ben passed away aged 25 years. Ben was the incredibly loved brother of Samuel Jones, Son of Barbara and Lindsay Jones and adored by all who knew him.

Daniel is doing his PhD in Proteomics and Systems Biology at UNSW under Prof. Marc Wilkins after completing his BSc in Molecular Biology and MSc in Structural Biology at University Paris Diderot. Unsatisfied with how busy he had been with his doctoral research, Daniel decided to step up and oversee the iGEM team alongside Dr Chris Marquis to make sure no more free hours were left in his days. Daniel has a dark side: when not at the lab bench surrounded by tube racks, you’ll find him at the bench or the power rack in the gym preparing for the next powerlifting competition.
Dr Chris Marquis
Chris received a B.Sc. degree in Chemistry and B.E degree in Chemical Engineering from the University of Sydney. After working as a research assistant on a project sponsored by CSL and doing some travelling, he returned to complete a PhD at the University of Sydney in bioreactor design and operation for antibody producing mammalian cell lines. He was appointed as a Lecturer at the University of New South Wales in 1994 and promoted to Senior Lecturer in 2004.Chris’s current interests include the development of lipases for biodiesel production, understanding the regulation of soluble hydrogenase expression in Cupriavidius necator and in the development of recombinant enzymes for bioremediation applications. And iGEM.
Prof. Marc Wilkins
In 1994, Marc Wilkins developed the concept of the proteome and coined the term. In 1997 he co-wrote and co-edited the first book on proteomics (4,000+ copies sold). This, and a series of other seminal works, substantially contributed to the establishment of the proteome and of proteome research. Proteomics is the most widely adopted of the new -omics, is now included in biochemistry textbooks and the undergraduate curriculum. Marc's research is currently focused on discovering the protein interaction code and new protein methylation enzymes."

On behalf of the team
A project of this scale would not have been able to be completed without an amazing group of people supporting our us. Many thanks on behalf of the entire BABS UNSW iGEM team go out to these individuals and organisations:
Dr Chris Marquis- Allowing us to use his lab space, helping us navigate the realm of grants, university admin and other bureaucracy. We wouldn't have made it nearly this far if we weren't able to email you at 4 pm when we ran out of an enzyme and for you to get it to us by 5.
Daniel Winter-Inspiring us constantly, providing an endless wealth of knowledge, tireless hours in the lab and dank memes. Words can't describe how far up the creek we would be without you as our paddle.
Robbie Oppenheimer-For introducing us to the world of iGEM, bringing the team together, running the boot camp and being an all round absolute champion. Without you this journey wouldn’t have even started.
BABS UNSW- For providing us with our initial funding and continual support throughout the project.
SAMS UNSW- For fundraising for the cost of our trip through bake sales, our wallets thank you but our waists not so much.
Macquarie iGEM and Dr. Rob Willows for providing us with the Synechocystis integrative plasmid psBH02 (which was used a control for our transformations) and a transfectable Synechocystis strain, as well for advice on transformation protocols.
Dr. Jeff Welsh from BABS UNSW for advice on Lactococcus species, plasmids and electrotransformation protocols.
Thanks to 2014 iGEM teams from University of Sydney and University of Melbourne for their assistance and advice during our introductory bootcamp in February.
Jon Berengut and Cyril Tang for running workshops (about design and wiki building, respectively) during our February bootcamp.
Thanks to the 2015 Macquarie and Sydney iGEM teams for providing helpful feedback about our project and presentation during both meet ups we attended.
For our mammalian cells we must thank the Whittaker, Brown and Marquis labs (all BABS UNSW) for our HeLaT, CHO7 and BHK21 cells respectively.
Without IDT and their generous donation of gBLOCK synthesis we wouldn't have been able to create half as many parts and make our vision into the project it is today.
Our Inspiration
Our project was influenced by the Warsaw iGEM teams of 2009 and 2010. Research that also inspired us was “Towards a Synthetic Chloroplast” (Agapakis, 2011) and “A Power-Law Dependence of Bacterial Invasion on Mammalian Host Receptors” (Lee, 2015).
A big thanks to all our sponsors:"

Nothing is ever accomplished alone. Here would like to briefly thank all of the people who helped make our iGEM endeavor a success.
From the UvA
SILS Department of Molecular Microbial Physiology The Swammerdam Institute for Life Sciences (SILS) is the institute in which our iGEM team conducted the majority of our research, specifically within the Molecular Microbial Physiology. We are very grateful for them agreeing to host our team for the summer months  during our project. We are also grateful for the expertise of the professionals in the lab who would aid us with trivial problems that we had.
Prof. Klaas Hellingwerf was the group leader of the Department we worked in. We are very thankful for him allowing us to work in his department. We are also very thankful for the great advice he gave us regarding our project theme and its potential shortcomings.
Photanol for inspiration in respect to future industrial applications of our work. We shared a lab with this start-up company and they were nothing but excellent neighbours, helping us learn our way around the lab and handing out excellent pointers on our lab technique
Lab of Filipe Branco dos Santos We worked primarily within the lab of Filipe Branco dos Santos,  whose additional members also offered us support around the lab.
Phillip Savakis for great advice and encouraging us to follow through with his work
From the VU
Lab of Bas Teusinkfor hosting our iGEM team member working on the emulsion protocol
Frank Bruggeman who had the overall task of coordinating the supervision of part of the modelling activities
Willi Gottstein for the daily supervision of Tamar and the help, encouraging words and constructive criticism of her constraint-based modeling work.
Brett for ensuring a smooth implementation of all computational tools, or was he not the mastermind behind the fully open-source modelling software platform.
Herwig Bachmann who invented the yield selection protocol in chemoheterotrophs and here so enthusiastically encouraged us to extended it, generously sharing with us all his accumulated experience working with droplets.
Vera Benavente for always being there making sure all that was needed was available at the Teusink Group.
Marc Hanemaaijer and Lucas Patti for technical assistance in practical issues regarding how to best culture phototrophs in emulsions.

Nicolas Vecchini
Nico, our Puerto Rican who managed to find his way to Europe all the way from the Caribbean. Making a pit stop in Spain to get his undergraduate degree in biology, Nico did an internship in genetics in which he tried to turn Pseudomonas Syringae - a nasty plant-killing pathogen - blue, supposedly with a brilliant purpose. He then went over to Germany do even more work in plant physiology, leveraging the potential of plants to save mankind one small step at a time. Nico also enjoys long walks, contemplating metabolic routes over tea, and sometimes secretly wishes everyone would just do the same.
Hugo Pineda
A bonafide true Spaniard, Hugo has also travelled a long way from his Spanish undergraduate education in Biology, to study a masters in the heart of the Netherlands. With his inquisitive mind and passion for all things undefined, he plays an irreplaceable role in our team. Fond of ants and bubbles, his strangely specific sense of humour and oscar winning smile adds to his already multidimensional personality. After iGEM, Hugo will be involved in the largest sequencing effort to date to map out the avocado’s complete genome - he calls it the human genome project, but for avocados.
Stijn Kok
Our member with the least international name. His interests include modelling stochastic processes in cyanobacteria, creating almost - but not quite - hipster targeted music, and pondering the intricate complexity of life, the universe and everything. So deviously handsome he could be a part time model (but probably would still need to keep his day job), Stijn plans to spend part of his time seducing/informing the general public on the implications of synthetic biology and part of his time distracting us while writing nerdy lab songs and making a model or two.
David Lips
David obtained his free spirited nature from his secular education at the Amsterdam University College, where he explored the boundaries of life as we know it in a revolutionary Biology/Physics/Math/Engineering/Psychology/Art joint bachelor’s degree programme. Swayed by evolution’s elegant design principles, he believes synthetic biology can solve mankind’s most pressing problems and is completing his masters degree in preparation to lead the way. When not working (never), David plays improv theater and tries to make people laugh so hard that triple DNA helices form spontaneously.
Christine Anyansi
Christine graduated with a Biology bachelors degree from the States. Prior to coming to Amsterdam for her master’s degree, she contributed to the growth and success of some of the most innovative biotech startups in Boston. By joining the iGEM team, she brings not only her love of Scrubs but also her joyous and peaceful spirit. She likes to think she is the team’s glue and without her, we would spontaneously combust into pieces of dutch and spanish castaways.
Tamar Huygen
With a degree in biology and several years experience studying mathematics, Tamar is the perfect bridge between our modelling and laboratory efforts. She can plot growth rates from second-order non-linear differential equations in her mind, and then directly translate the results into actionable steps in the lab. When not growing pathogenic bacteria in her garage, Tamar can be found climbing in one of Holland’s many indoor climbing halls, reaching for heights she will surely top with this iGEM project.
Joeri Joengblots *Honorary Member*
This master student is also known as the 5th beatle of our iGEM team. With his previous work on building the software for the turbidostats he enabled us to perform the experiments that demonstrated instability of the lactate strain, one of the biggest successes of our project. He has a background in computer science but this did not prevent him from going deep into evolutionary biology and wet lab.  He likes to do things that at first sight seem impossible but he somehow manages to find a way to accomplish it.  Funnily enough, when we came to the lab for the first time he, the IT guy, was teaching us, the biologists, how to culture bacteria and work aseptically. In exchange we helped him out in building software to analyze and visualize the vast amount of data that he gathers with his program. A perfect synchrony where roles are exchanged, this is the beauty of multidisciplinarity in action.
Assist. Prof. dr. Filipe Branco dos Santos
Instructors
Words cannot express the utmost gratitude we have to these two scientists for entering into this endeavour with us. To them we owe all of our success. We are extremely fortunate to have such a confident and driven professor, such as Filipe, watching over us each step of the way. Because of this we were able to achieve much more than an ordinary group of six students could ever imagine. The constant push we received to expect better, to do better, to think better, to be better will stay with us for the rest of our scientific carreers.

Amoy Newsletter
This year, we have taken part in the biweekly newsletter hosted by iGEM Amoy , iGEM Paris Bettencourt and iGEM Pasteur . The newsletter presents projects of participating iGEM teams and focuses on topics interesting for Synthetic Biology. So far, special themes of the newsletter have been the controversial use of CRISPR to modify human embryos, software programs and the state of SynBio in many different countries. Check them out below!
Amoy newsletter issue 1 - How to set up and operate an iGEM team.
This issue of the Newsletter was aimed at future iGEM teams. To this end, the Newsletter gives iGEM teams room to describe the composition of their team and how their team is operated. This includes which teachers and students guide the team throughout the competition, from which department the team members originate and how to overcome difficulties. We contributed to this issue by describing the composition of our team, the distribution of team roles as well as making jokes about pizza.
Amoy newsletter issue 2 - Project introductions and ethical discussions.
The second issue of the newsletter was set to be published two weeks after Chinese scientists had succesfully used CRISPR-Cas9 technology to edit the human genome. Sparked by the outcry within the scientific community, the newsletter gave room for ethical discussions on the subject. In addition to the ethical viewpoints from different iGEM teams from all over the world, the newsletter gave room for some iGEM teams to present their projects.
Amoy newsletter issue 3 - Show our projects.
The third issue of newsletter gave room to iGEM teams to present their projects. This issue contains project descriptions from teams from South America, Asia, Europe and Northern-America, targeting problems like lung cancer, malnourishment and bee & bat pathogens.
Amoy newsletter issue 4 (special) - The development of synthetic biology in different countries.
For the fourth newsletter, Amoy asked contributing times to describe the development of Synthetic Biology in their home countries. The guide features among others pieces on synthetic biology in Canada, France, Honduras, Slovenia & the US. For this piece, we assessed synthetic biology efforts within the Netherlands, describing the National Institute for Public Health and Environment, the Rathenau Institute and the Dutch multinational DSM. It seems that even though synthetic biology has sparked great interest from the public internationally, much bars still need to be cleared for it to be able to deliver on its promise.
Amoy newsletter issue 5 - Project update and three new parts.
The fifth issue of newsletter was dedicated to the projects. We contributed to the issue by giving a short and a little dated description of our project. In addition to this description, we placed a call for contributors to our cloning guide.
Amoy newsletter issue 6 - Special Issue: Software.
The sixth issue of the newsletter was a special issue centered around software different teams are using within their iGEM project. We contributed to the guide by giving an overview of the software packages we were using as well as short descriptions of these packages.
PenPal
Team William and Mary has set up a PenPal application where different teams with the same interested were linked to each other. Our team was matched with Concordia as we were both working with membrane proteins. Through this PenPal match we have reached out to them and a brief discussion about both our projects has been taking place.
H2O
During the project we received an e-mail from iGEM team York . They were performing an investigation on the drinking water across different countries in the world. They wanted to determine the phosphate levels in water in different countries. To help them two different samples of 50ml H2O were taken. One sample was drawn from a kitchen water tap, the other was taken from a water tap outside. The pH of these samples was determined with the use of a pH meter. After the pH was taken they were filtered and send to York. Curious about their results? Check it our here .
Interview
Team NAIT_Edmonton has started a collaboration with teams from the track New Application. The purpose of their collaboration was to enquire teams on their process during this iGEM competition. They tried to investigate what problems teams ran into and how these problems were solved. To help them in their research we have agreed to do a skype interview. During this interview we discussed both ours and their project and how we  have overcome some troubles. Curious about their results? Check it our here .

Supervisors
Our iGEM adventure began in January 2015. From this moment till the very end of our iGEM Project, we were guided by our advisors Luc Brunsveld, Maarten Merkx and Tom de Greef. They helped us with brainstorming, by asking the right questions at the right moment and by advising us on problem solving. We wouldn't be able to pull this project off without them. Please find below a short profile for each of our advisors.
Prof.dr.ir. L. (Luc) Brunsveld
Prof. dr. ir. Luc Brunsveld is professor at our university. He lectured our team in courses concerning chemical biology, for example 'pharmacology' and 'molecular biology of the cell'. Besides lecturing students, he conducts research at our university concerning protein-protein interactions. Him being a busy man, we are more than happy that he took the time to advise us during the project.
For a more extensive (and professional) biography, hit the button.
Luc (Lucas) Brunsveld (1975) received his PhD degree in 2001 under supervision of prof. Bert Meijer at the Eindhoven University of Technology. Topic of the thesis was the self-assembly of designed molecules into helical architectures in water. Subsequently, he moved as a Humboldt fellow to the Max Planck Institute of Molecular Physiologie, Dortmund, to work on the protein semi-synthesis and evaluation of lipidated Ras GTPases in the group of prof. Herbert Waldmann. From 2003-2004 he worked as a group leader in the medicinal chemistry department of Organon (now Schering-Plough) in Oss, on nuclear receptor medicinal chemistry.
End of 2004 Luc Brunsveld received the Sofja Kovalevskaja Award from the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation, with which he established his own research group at the MPI of Molecular Physiologie, Dortmund, beginning 2005. He worked on the combination of supramolecular chemistry with protein biochemistry and cellular biology, generating new approaches to modulate biological processes. In 2006 he became group leader at the Chemical Genomics Centre of the Max Planck Society, Dortmund. Here he was working on the chemical biology of nuclear receptors to understand and modulate the nuclear receptor-cofactor interaction, in close collaboration with Bayer-Schering Pharma, Merck-Serono, and Schering-Plough.
In the middle of 2008 Luc Brunsveld received an ERC starting grant and became full professor in chemical biology in the Department of Biomedical Engineering at the Eindhoven University of Technology. In his research Luc Brunsveld uses chemical biology approaches to study protein-protein interactions. Two general themes are: 1) Supramolecular Architectures are being pursued as instruments to modulate protein-protein interactions and 2) the Nuclear Receptor – Cofactor interaction is being investigated as a specific protein-protein interaction with many unsolved questions, possibly amendable via chemical biology
Dr. Ir. T.F.A. (Tom) de Greef
Dr. Ir. Tom de Greef is the person you need to talk to when it comes to modeling. He knows all about it and is very well informed about the current developments in the field of synthetic (and computational) biology. Tom is closely associated with our project and provided us with more than enough reading material.
For a more extensive (and professional) biography, hit the button.
Dr. Ir. Tom de Greef (1980) was born in Eindhoven, the Netherlands, and studied at the University of Eindhoven (TU/e), where he received his MSc degree in Biomedical Engineering cum laude in 2004. He completed his PhD at the Department of Chemistry at the same university in 2008 with professors E. W. Meijer and R. P. Sijbesma, working on novel polymeric materials based on quadruple hydrogen bonding motifs. Subsequently, he moved to the Biomodeling and Bioinformatics group headed by prof. P. A. J. Hilbers at the Department of Biomedical Engineering (TU/e), studying self-assembling systems from a computational perspective. He also became assistant professor at this department in 2010. In 2013, Tom de Greef was a visiting scholar in the group of Prof. D. Weitz (Harvard) working on protein affinity screening using droplet microfluidics. Current research themes are centered on the engineering of artificial cellular systems (bottom-up synthetic biology) with the aim to rationalize physicochemical design principles of biological systems and to develop novel biotechnological applications. In this multidisciplinary work he combines his fascination for (bio)chemistry, mathematical modeling, microfluidics and complex systems. In 2012 and 2013 he was awarded a VENI and an ECHO-STIP grant respectively by the Netherlands Organization of Scientific Research (NWO). He is also core member of the Institute for Complex Molecular Systems (ICMS).
Prof dr. M. (Maarten) Merkx
Prof dr. Maarten Merkx is probably the most busy person on the planet. He is invited to speak about his projects all over the world, for example at the World Economic Forum 2015. He is also taking the time to lecture students at our university and conducts interesting research about protein sensors. In his spare time he was shining on national television. Logically, we are very honored that he is advising us during our project.
For a more extensive (and professional) biography, hit the button.
Maarten Merkx (1970) studied physical organic chemistry and biochemistry at the Radboud University Nijmegen (cum laude). He did his PhD with Prof. Averill (University of Amsterdam) working on purple acid phosphatases, and subsequently was a Human Frontier of Science Program post-doctoral fellow with Prof. Lippard (MIT) studying methane monooxgenases. Currently he is professor in protein engineering at the Eindhoven University of Technology. An important research theme is to develop generic engineering concepts for the development of protein-based switches, which include fluorescent sensors for intracellular imaging of metal ions, photo-switchable proteins, and protein-based sensors for antibody detection. He obtained young investigator grants from the HFSP and NWO (VIDI, 2006) and an ERC consolidator grant in 2011. In 2012 he received the award for the best TU/e teacher at the master level."

Attributions
Each team must clearly attribute work done by the student team members on this page. The team must distinguish work done by the students from work done by others, including the host labs, advisors, instructors, and individuals not on the team roster.
Can we base our project on a previous one?
Yes! You can have a project based on a previous team, or based on someone else's idea, as long as you state this fact very clearly and give credit for the original project.
Why is this page needed?
The Attribution requirement helps the judges know what you did yourselves and what you had help with. We don't mind if you get help with difficult or complex techniques, but you must report what work your team did and what work was done by others.
For example, you might choose to work with an animal model during your project. Working with animals requires getting a license and applying far in advance to conduct certain experiments in many countries. This is difficult to achieve during the course of a summer, but much easier if you can work with a postdoc or PI who has the right licenses.

Motivation for Igem Participation
Biotechnology, although not my chosen field of study, is one of my enduring interests. The opportunity to work alongside some of South Africa’s most capable young scientists, in pursuit of a novel application for existing, and created, constructs, is extremely appealing to me on a personal level. As a Computer Science student, I lack the practical capabilities of some of my peers, but am extremely interested in learning and participating to the best of my ability.
In terms of my future studies, I believe that the knowledge gained throughout the course of this project will provide invaluable insight into unexplored approaches to the field of Artificial Intelligence. Novel problem-solving, using biologically inspired computer systems, has become a complex and fascinating part of modern information sciences; and, I believe, this project will afford me an incredibly rich learning opportunity.

Motivation for Igem Participation
I joined this team in a hope of further increasing my understanding of biotechnology, it has always interested me, and although it is not directly related to the degree I am aiming for (BSc Hons Medicinal Plants) it is a very important part of the world we live in today and its contribution to society is only growing larger each year. With endless possibilities, I felt that I needed to be a part of this community in some way, and I hope to make a large contribution to my team and also hope that my team makes a valuable contribution to scientific community.
Another reason that motivated my participation was the invaluable contribution that this opportunity would add to my CV, and the experience that would be gained in several of the laboratory techniques which will undoubtedly help me in my scientific career. In short, it is an amazing opportunity, and I am honoured to be a part of such an extraordinary team.

Motivation for Igem Participation
I have been exposed to science since a young age. My father is a virologist of the University of Pretoria and specializes in plant pathology. As a youngster I frequently accompanied to him work where I recall being fascinated by pH indicator colour changes, electron microscope images and the cabinets packed with arrays of chemicals. Growing up, my interest evolved from rocket science to (more realistically) chemistry and I finally settled on biology, specifically the molecular aspects.
I am currently engaged in an honors degree in microbiology with my research project aimed at creating a recombinant version of African horse sickness virus with a non-structural gene knock out. This project has been both challenging and engaging and I am looking forward to the remainder of the year.
I believe that society is in a revolution in which the great potential of biotechnology is being realized. Modern techniques are advancing our understanding of the fundamental workings of biological systems and new applications are being developed daily. This is undoubtedly a very exciting time to be in the position of young scientist entering a field with the resources and support currently being invested. iGEM is a great opportunity to learn about new molecular mechanisms and techniques. I look forward to meet people who have had years of experience in and share a similar appreciation for synthetic biology. Further I hope to share my experience with the members of our team and in doing so develop lasting friendships.

From left to right: My name is Qiaochu Guo. I am a current student of Nanjing Foreign Languages School and will graduate in 2016. I have a broad range of academic interests, including biology, physics, chemistry and management. I am especially interested in the intersection of biology and physics, such as electronic and molecular devices for health care and other purposes. In my free time, I also enjoy debate, cooking, watching and reading sci-fi. I'm Yinuo Jin from Nanjing Foreign Language School. I'm seventeen years old and now ‎in Senior 3. I have some academic interests such as biology and history. In my excurricular time, I spend a lot of time reading biology books, watching related documentaries and going to laboratories to fulfill myself. Not only attending iGEM, I also took part in a research studying  taxonomy of arethusa. From these experiences, I found my academic passion and practiced my experimenting skills and I'm willing to continue studying biology in university. I’m Chen Xin, a senior two student from Nanjing Foreign language school.  Biology is the one of the school subjects I like most. I am often impressed by the organisms in which the working mechanism is precise and innovative. I spent a great amount of time reading those bulky books required for basic knowledge of biology. Though others may regard reading thick books as a dull way to learn, I find it rather interesting because it’s able to present me with a whole picture of the subject and then reveal specific details one by one. After mastering the knowledge needed, I was then able to figure out my own idea and then put it to practice. My name is Xinran Han, a senior student in Nanjing Foreign Language School. Studying Biology for almost five years, I’ve developed a fascination in this field, as well as other relevant disciplines such as neuroscience. Apart from Biology, I also love physics, during whose courses I discovered my interest and passion to work in labs. In my leisure time, I like to study some programming and computer science knowledge, hoping that one day I can combine my computer science skills and principles in biology and cognitive science to dig deeper into the Artificial Intelligence field. My name is Weiyu DU and I’m from China. I always have great passion for robotics, engineering and neuroscience. As a girl, I specialize in control of mobile robots and programming. Since Grade 8, I have participated in a number of robotics competitions such as WER and FTC. In my first competition of robotics, I won the champion of Jiangsu Province. Moreover, our team ranked the 6th place and got into semi-finals in the 2015 FIRST Tech Challenge Asian-Pacific Invitational. Now I’m President of Robotics Club in my school and would like to pursue my dream as an excellent engineer in the future. Not only do I possess interest in robots but also in neuroscience. I find the mystery of brain and neurons fascinating and get most excited when it overlaps with robot engineering. I do seriously think that we could get inspiration from the communication between neurons and the delicate design of neuro system that could apply in the fields of engineering and communication. After all, everything’s possible as long as our imagination lasts. Hi, my name is Jiaping Wang, and I come from Nanjing Foreign Language School. I have always thought that I am a science type person, because I am crazy about physics, attending numerous competitions and projects. Last year, I published a paper about superconductivity on Journals of Alloys and Compounds, but I am not satisfied with only sticking with physics, and that is why I join the igem. I just cannot help searching the truth beneath the common phenomenon. I’m Juefei Kuang. I am the team captain of Nanjing_NFLS. I am big fan of experiments of all kinds, especially those with cool phenomena and mind-blowing ideas. In my spare time, I usually play ball games and video games with my friends and classmates. Igem is really a great opportunity for me because during the communication with experts and other iGEMers, I not only improved my academic ability but also enhanced friendships with so many cool people. I am Chunyang Xie from Nanjing Foreign Language School. I have a wide variety of interest, from humanities to science, and to art as well. Having done many research in Physics and taken part in Physics competitions in the past a few years, Biology to me is indeed a new thing. Reading news on recent achievements in Genics and Neural Biology, I expect Biology to have great impacts on our way of life in the next decades. That’s why I read extensively about Biology and accepted my friend Figo’s invitation to join this iGEM competition. I was very glad to find out that some of my knowledge in Physics and Mathematics in fact donated help to our study and experiments, for sciences are interconnected and share similar principles. This experience turned out to be inspiring too, not only in terms of subject knowledge but also in terms of team work and cooperation, which should serve as a good preparation for our future studies and careers. I'm Yuqing Zhang from Nanjing Foreign Language School, senior 2. It would be my great pleasure to attend the igem competition with congenial youngsters this summer. In school, I not only shoulder the responsibility of biology' TA but also actively take part in numerous biological clubs, especially organizing the school project of Plant Tissue Cultivation. We arranged detailed experiments to discuss different nutrient profiles' effects on green vegetables and videoed the whole process, which was later presented on NFLS's official website. In my free time, I also attended several lab projects in university. The hot topics of golden rice and effects of transgenic food really inspired my great interest in this subject as well as strengthened my personal lab skills. During the preparation of igem, I did learn a lot about vaccine and spread out meaningful information to my surrounding family and friends who used to embrace kind of misconceptions. Those evidence mentioned prove my great passion toward igem, one of the most influential competitions for young people all over the world. My name is Xu Chi. I am a senior from Nanjing Foreign Language School. Academically, my favorite subjects are Physics and Biology because I really love the feeling of discovering and doing experiments. Researching on topics of such scientific subjects is definitely what I always pursue for. Other than that, my biggest hobby is playing basketball. Furthermore, I’m the captain of the basketball team of my school and have led the team to win consecutive 2 regional championships in recent two years. I really appreciate the chance of Participating in iGem and I really learned a lot from this experience. My name is Di Chen, a senior two student from Nanjing Foreign Language School.I am a science kind of person and I am really fascinated by the experiments and stuff. I love iGEM for it provides us with opportunities to cooperate with other people with more lab experience. I hope iGEM can become better year by year. I am Tianci Hu and I am a senior student from NFLS in China.My hobby is to conduct experiments of all kinds, so I had fun during the iGEM journey. Though I don't have the chance to personally go to Boston, I really cherish this iGEM experience for it did improve my scientific study and lab skills. My name is Yao Li, a senior student from NFLS. I am really interested in biology and my career preference is be to involved in biology experiments. This iGEM experience helps me to understand better of what a lab life is and what difficulties and chanllenges may I encounter in the future. I love my teammates and partners! I am Yifei Shen, a senior student in NFLS. Though I wasn't really into the lab stuff, I attended the public forum and became a fan of iGEM. It is a such mind-blowing experience that I really widen my horizon through it!
I’m Zhiyang Shi, and I am the main instructor of Nanjing_NFLS. I graduated with PhD from Nanjing Medical University in microbiology. I am currently in charge of the Jiangsu Center for Disease Control Virus Research Department. In addition, I’m responsible for the whole teams’ training and safety during the process.
I’m Zhibing Cao, the other instructor of Nanjing_NFLS. I am responsible for organizing the team and guaranteeing the safety."

Besides, he has a great interest in computer programming and team management. In USTC-Software team, he is the vice  captain and he is responsible for  Human Practice and Collaboration with USTC team. He is an out-goning guy and he's willing to make friends with others.
Steven is from Nanjing and his major is physics.He has great desire to explore a new field and iGEM enables him to meet different people. He likes playing handball and table tennis. With strong desire to do interdisciplinary study, he is willing to discuss with every iGEMer!
Zhi Li, or Nate, is currently a junior student from School for the Gifted Young (SCGY), USTC.  He has many hobbies，especially music and reading, and sports like soccer as well. In this summer,  he spent a lot time playing chess with others in the intervals of iGEM project. Besides, he is open-minded,  helpful and considered to be interesting when the team members work together. The persistence and optimism  are quite the shining points on him.
CHEN XINAN, or Nancy Chan, is manager of our team as well as a junior majoring Mathematics. She loves Sciences but unfortunately understanding them has always been a tough problem for her. She can undoubtedly be described as an interesting and humorous girl. You just never get bored with her around. Anyone can tell that she ‘hates’ our captain because, as she said, they are not in the same dimensionality. LOL! Nancy develops a lot of hobbies such as swimming, badminton, travelling, skiing, photographing, etc. But not table tennis! You will regret playing with her.
Hi! My name is Lingyuan Ji. I major in Theoretical Physics in USTC. My main contribution to the team is the molecule dynamics algorithm in BioBLESS. I always like to ask why to interesting things and try my best to figure them out. Hey, what's up there? Let's find out why XD.

Zhu Yilin, or George, a sophomore who majors in physics, takes a great interest in programming. Well, maybe neither physics nor programming does he really well in, but still passion remains in his life for getting to know about technological stuffs. Of course, there are many things that are his enjoyments, such as travelling, reading books, and writing essays to express his love to his life occasionally. In this year’s competition, his work is coding team’s wiki along with his teammates, and he is having a lot of fun in finding the beauty of programming!
Wulonghao, and you can call him Bill. This guy is a young geek OTAKU who is deeply in love with ACG and science. Maybe sounds awesome, but that is really creepy actually. When not knowing how to write the code, he will go around the room or the building even the whole house. And all what he has done or what he is dong have nothing to do with his major, Physics.
Zongxin Yang, often called St. Yang, who comes from School of Information Science and Technology, USTC, has just entered sophomore year in this semester. His frankness and easy-going make him quite welcome in our team. Also, he is a crazy fan of football and chess. It is worth mentioning that he is one of the members of school football team. His hometown lies in the north of Guilin, which is famous as one of China's most picturesque cities. In our project, he has undertaken mainly the front-end code, and proves to be hard-working.
Liu Miaofeng, is a sophomore student from USTC. He helps the team for the editor of wiki. He is interested in programming and DIY something useful, for example, he participated the robot competition. Besides, he is friendly to others, but he may be a little shy. So you could try to communicate with him and enjoy the conversation.
LI Zitian, is a junior in Physics and Computer Science and Technology.He has a great interest in computer programming. For example, he is skilled in C, C++, Java, Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript and so on. He has wrote several websites because of the interests during the school life, so he is experienced in Front-end web develop. What's more, he is also interested in biology. For the reasons given above, he wants to join the team USTC-Software.
Henry, or Li Hanwen, was a freshman in electrical engineering. He works in front-end group and makes the wiki. He is so zhuangbility that he knows a lot about computer technology cursorily but not profoundly. He loves table tennis and singing. He has an ambition to be a bass and have a low-frequency voice.

Zhang Hao, or Trumpet, is a sophomore in Physics. YES, his English name is Trumpet, because his Chinese name has the similar sound with the trumpet.he loves cats, and he is simply the most artless person in the whole team. Sometimes, He even labels himself as a 'cat'.
Si-Yuan Zhuang, majoring in Computer Science, having mastery of programming and bug-fixing,   contributes a lot to improving the quality of the code and designing the cache system. He often  has fun with others (e.g. hacking Zhang Hao's server). Though once a platform developed by him  for our software was deprecated, he did not feel depressed.
Tianyi Cui, known as little Cui, is the leader of the backend of our project. He has a bad eyesight but he seldom take his glasses. He is an outcome boy in the team, always filling with novel ideas in his mind. He could play a little ping-pong ball but he never wins Zhi Li.
Cui Yanxuan, or E-Neo (His screen name) is a jonior majoring in Geophysics (seems nothing to do with biology?). He is interested in computer and crazy about opensource software. He is a memeber of the backend group. After join the team, he spent a lot of time to learn about sythetic biology. Besides, he loves playing games with other teamates.

A: I don't wanna define my life and tag myself. A scientist could also be artist, social                                 activist, photographer or travel enthusiasts. All I need to do is to love the thing I                                 cherish and cherish the people I love. Power, money, reputation, all turned to dust                                 finally, even so, there is nothing more precious and everlasting than love.I am so                                 satisfied to lead such a happy life with you guys.

Q: Oh, my dear Boss Huang, my headphone is broken. What should I do?
A: Well, well, well, it depends on which brand you prefer，Sennheiser, Technica or AKG? I                                 will give you a discount. Although it is sent from Japan , I will take package freight.
Q: Ok, that's not real you. What does the future look like?
A: Love can cross the chasm sex and species. The computer has become the carrier of life
Li Kai
How you dressed like that, ah you wanna marry someone,or finally decide to take off                                 alone up ?Although it looks cool , it also seems difficult to be approached.
......You know, you have already turned to hands carcinoma at advanced stage?
Q: Do you believe the life sciences can really bring people love and happiness?
A: Tool itself does not bring happiness, but I have no doubt on the infinite human                                 possibilities.
Yan Ning
Black Cat loyal fan, I have already called the police , she will get you!
Really?! Oh Yes, let the storm come, let my dear Black Cat come! Oh my dear Black Cat. I                                 do not know how long you have been admired.
Zhang Qijun
Q: Hey, you are putting on weight recently! Look at your extra padding in the                                 stomach......
A: Eh, actually, I always had little stomach fat. Ignore me, ahaha!
Q: Fine~Are you still watching that beautiful sky?
A: Definitely yes, Really I hope those beautiful planets have life. However, maybe we                                 should first study and understand ourselves, this will take an initiative position if                                 they visited. I wanna quote a words to bless iGEM USTC, ""May the Force be with you"".
Shen Zeyu
A: Hey dude, you should watch today's Shanghai news !
Q: What did they say? What happened to you! Oh no!
A: A man from Hefei was inexplicably refused a visa for the first time, and is passed                                 the second time. What a miracle!
Q: That's awesome! Do you have any comments on those scientific mysteries hidden in the                                 deep darkness?
A: Everything in the world has a property called inertia, learning from previous                                 research is exactly one kind of inertia. Mankind also has a property named self-willed,                                 completely out of the current study, full play to our imagination that is capricious.                                 When the combination of inertia and capricious happened, nothing unknown will be                                 missing!
Tian Shanquan
Q: What does Shanquan mean in Chinese? I felt like it quite speical.

Q: Wow, that's amazaing! I guess that's reason why SPRING is called SPRING! Another                                 question, to participate in a cross-disciplinary research is what kind of experience
A: It is the first time that I realized that physics is not just physics, biology is not                                 just biology, what we have is the whole world of science. Learned how to cooperate is                                 also what I gained.
Li Huimu
Q: Are you Kung Fu Master Huiri or Master Huimu, and do you know angular momentum mass                                 density?
A: Oh yeah, comet once hit Jupiter , and then I was born. Yeah, I am so familiar with angular momentum mass density. Because I am a biophysicist.
Q: why do you enjoy conducting research?
A: Actually, I really enjoyed analyzing electrophoresis results. Conducting research                                 makes me tranquil. Research lets me stay away from the temptation of money, and it makes                                 me spare no effort to realize life values I hold.
Ma Kaiyue
Q: We all know that you have a superhero dream. If you were given a choice, the Flash or the       Millipede Man, which one would you choose to become?

Zhou Qiuxia
Q: How do you like to have a boyfriend younger than you?
A: Well, it's hard to say!
Q: Fine, I heard that you are more interested in cancer research, for this complex                                 disease, what do you say about it?

Hefei City
Hefei formerly known as Hofei, Luzhou, or Luchow, is the capital and largest city of                                 Anhui Province in Eastern China. A prefecture-level city, it is the political, economic,                                 and cultural center of Anhui. Located in the central portion of the province.
From the 8th to the 6th century BC, Hefei was the site of many small states, later a part                                 of the Chu kingdom. Many archaeological finds dating from this period have been made.                                 The name Hefei was first given to the county set up in the area under the Han dynasty in                                 the 2nd century BC. During the 4th to the 6th century AD, this crucial border region                                 between northern and southern states was much fought over; its name and administrative                                 status were consequently often changed. During the Sui (581–618) and Tang (618–907)                                 periods, it became the seat of Lu prefecture—a title it kept until the 15th century,                                 when it became a superior prefecture named Luzhou.
Hefei plays an important role in scientific research in China. It has seven national                                 laboratories, second only to Beijing: The National Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory (Chinese: 国家同步辐射实验室; pinyin: Guójiā tóngbù fúshè shíyàn shì), the Hefei National                                 Laboratory for Physical Sciences at the Microscale (Chinese: 微尺度物质科学国家实验室; pinyin: Wēi                                 chǐdù wùzhí kēxué guójiā shíyàn shì), both of which are under the University of Science                                 and Technology of China. It also has the Institute of Solid State Physics, Institute of                                 Plasma Physics, Institute of Intelligent Machines, High Magnetic Field Laboratory                                 (founded in 2008), Anhui Institute of Optics and Fine Mechanics, all of which are under                                 the Hefei Institute of Physical Sciences which belongs to the Chinese Academy of                                 Sciences.Hefei is the location of EAST, an experimental superconducting tokamak magnetic                                 fusion energy reactor.

Our proposal is to create a system which allows us to measure a biological signal precisely and without delay. But we are not the first who make this kind of attempt. In 2008 Harvard iGem team developed a similar idea: they introduce a plasmid into Shewanella oneidensis which contain a Lac promoter   coupled with gene that codifies to mtrB cytochrome.  The last protein belongs to an oxidation complex that reduces minerals by electron transference. Hence, Shewanella produced an electrical signal when stimulated with lactose.
On the other hand, Chile 2012 coupled a bioluminescent molecule to the circadian clock of cyanobacteria. Their aim was to produce a bioluminescent cyanobacteria which lights up during dusk hours and regenerates the substrates during the day. And Cornell 2012 create a biosensor that generates and electrical output of to measure water quality in areas affected by oil and gas extraction. They also used the Shewanella cytochromes complex to produce the electrical signal."

The Team
Pedro José Quiroga Padilla
He is a fourth semester medicine student. His passion is to understand how we can think,  How the brain design enable us to accomplish this amazing task! However, learn about the brain is not the only think he enjoy: every attempt to understand the molecular basis of life and, contrary to this microscopic world, Pedro is amateur astronomer. The last fact is what motivates him to support in Maloka (a non-governmental organization) one time per month on Sky watching. Actually, he is trying to be involved in the scientific world and advance in his career, without forget to grow like a human, be happy and take risks.
Gabriela Melisa Montaño
Gabriela studies Biology at the Universidad de los Andes. However, that alone doesn’t define her completely. Sure, her future year self would like to would like to unravel the different mechanisms of evolution and diversity, observe living things, model relationships between them, put a little math and computer science in there, but who knows? She might discover a lot more things along the way. Science, though, has made her change her perception about magic, although she still likes fiction in most of its forms. She writes reaaally occasionally and doodles in class. She truly enjoyed engaging in this year’s Project, because of the things she learned, and the awesome people she met. She hopes there is a lot more where that came from next year!

Our team consists of nine ambitious students with interdisciplinary backgrounds from Delft University of Technology and Rotterdam University of Applied Sciences.
Max van't Hof
Hi! After doing the bachelor Life Science & Technology and being board member of the study association for one year I'm currently doing the master Life Science & Technology. I'm the science manager of this year's team. For me iGEM is a nice practical application of my master and also a good way to learn more about other subjects like policy & practice, fundraising and design.
Stefan Marsden
After my Bachelor in Chemistry at the University of Basel (CH), I was looking for a new challenge which I found in the Life Science & Technology Master and the iGEM competition. Biotechnology is a powerful tool to drive innovation towards greater sustainability in the chemical industry. My role is the scientific specification of our construct and hardware requirements for it to be put into practice. During my free time I fence saber on national level and I recently participated as a dancer in a theater production.
Tudor Vlas
Hey! I enrolled into iGEM because I saw it as a really challenging project, especially with respect to my background. I finished Automation and Computer Science at UT Cluj-Napoca (Romania) and am currently doing a Management of Technology Master's at TU Delft.

Team Members Attributions
During the iGEM Project we each contributed to the final result of the Biolinker. From organizing events, to working in the lab, hardware, modeling or policy and practice, credits go to the whole Biolink team.
Liana - Team Leader
As the team leader I was overseeing project progress and keeping track of deadlines. Held weekly report meetings and ensured that the project is going well as a whole. Organized Jamboree travel arrangements. Programmed most of the wiki website, added content and helped design it. Helped individual managers in their tasks - worked with Michelle on the Policy & Practice case study, helped Anne with organizing Fund Raising, helped Marit with PR efforts.  Contributed to good team cohesion and ensured that communication goes smoothly, within the team, with supervisors and supporters, and with other project stakeholders.
Max - Science Manager
I have worked with several others on the scientific background of the project and formulating the goals. This also involved the development of assays needed to assess whether we actually achieved these goals. Next to this I have worked a lot in the lab on different aspects, ranging from standard plasmid isolation and restriction/ligation to imaging samples with the spinning disk microscope. I really enjoyed working on the design of e.g. promotional material, presentations and the hardware manual. Further I presented at the RIVM/Rathenau event and will present at the Jamboree. Additionally, I have helped with development of the 3D printer and financials, although most credits go to fellow team members.
Hector - Lab Manager & Safety Manager
As Lab Manager, my function inside the group has been the design and coordination of the experiments performed in the laboratory. Also, I have been involved in the supply of the necessary materials for the project. On the other hand, as Safety Manager, I have been checking the regulations that apply to every module of our project, and checking their fulfillment in the working area. Specifically, the project parts where I worked were: lab setup, cloning experiments, characterization experiment, modeling counseling, safety forms fulfillment, protocol design, presentation storyline writing and wiki content writing. Furthermore, I actively helped the other team members in punctual tasks along the summer.
Samantha - Modeling Manager
As the Modeling Manager, I was responsible for translating the biological and chemical processes leading to biofilm formation in mathematical models. This included developing a model able to predict the protein production capacity of our cells and developing a model able to estimate the strength of our formed biofilm. In order for the modeling to have good synergy with the lab, I designed and performed experiments supporting the biological modeling. Furthermore, I interpreted and statistically analyzed part of the experiments and made the comic images throughout our wiki trying to explain our project in an accessible manner. Finally, it was my idea to build our 3D printer with K’NEX and subsequently build our first prototype.
Stefan - Hardware Manager
As the Hardware Manager of this project my task was to gain an overview of current bioprinting literature in order to design and lead the experiments in the wetlab connected to our prototype. This included identifying relevant parameters and continuously optimizing the conditions under which we could achieve the best results with our prototype 3D printer using bacterial bioink. The printer prototype itself was built by Samantha, Anne and Marit. Characterisation of movement and performance was my task again. In the design phase I was largely involved in developing the project idea and designing the biobricks required to meet our goals. Following this, I mostly spent my time in the wetlab working on the Interlab Study and cloning the devices for our biobricks. Finally I was partly involved in modeling and policy and practice, but most credit must be attributed to other team members there.
Michelle - Policy and Practice Manager
As the Policy and Practice manager I was responsible for finding all interesting applications for our project. For the data collection, required for the “Business Plan” and “Expert’s opinion”, I searched for, contacted and interviewed researchers, scientists and managers. I really enjoyed working with Tudor writing all the content on the Policy & Practice part. Furthermore, I was responsible for organizing our stand during ‘A Day of Wonder’, the business case and designing the workshop for the Science Centre Delft. During the RIVM/Rathenau event, Max and I presented and discussed our project. Next to this, I was responsible for the idea and design of the P&P tool and for setting up the P&P collaborations. I supported Marit also with PR activities, such as talking with the press advisors of the TU Delft and the communication advisor of our faculty. Additionally, I have helped with the financials and lab journal reporting, although most credits go to fellow team members.
Tudor - Wiki Manager
Designed and supervised how the wiki was built. Helped Liana with implementing website functionality, layout and adding content. Based on literature review, market analysis and data collection (questionnaires and interviews), wrote the “Business plan” and “How to write a business plan” sections. Helped with designing questionnaires and sending them out to researchers, scientists and managers, and contributed to analyzing responses. Helped Michelle with policy and practice efforts and wiki content writing, including ethics, regulations, outreach and overview.
Marit - PR Manager
As PR manager my function was managing contact with the community. Therefore I placed weekly, or more often, updates on facebook and twitter. I went with Michelle to the communication advisors of the TU Delft, and with their help arranged radio interviews. I also coordinated our project movie, and managed to get articles on different websites and magazines. Besides PR, I helped support others in their managing tasks. For policy and practice I joined Michelle with a few of her interviews, including organising the day of wonder, and we are going to organize a workshop in the Science Center of Delft for kids. For the modelling, I wrote the biofilm strength model, and helped develop the other models. For the wet lab, I helped whenever needed, such as doing the western blot experiment and the TEM microscopy.  For Hardware, i arranged that we get all the Knex, and was part of the designing process of the 3D-printers, creating the manual, and joined Anne to Groningen. For the Interlab studies, I made the statistical analysis of the data.
Anne - Budget and Fundraising Manager
As my manager name suggests, I handled all financial administration for the team, and acquired the sponsors. For the wet lab, I helped in the lab with cloning, and digitalising the lab book.  For hardware, I made the “Building the printer” movie, helped design the last version of the printer with Marit, and organized the collaboration with Groningen with Marit and Biolinker. For Policy and Practice, I helped Michelle with the Day of Wonder, the collaborations with iGEM teams, and the RIVM/Rathenau. Besides my main function, I regularly checked documents for spelling mistakes (my second function being the spelling checker). For the final presentation, Max and I will be presenting.
Media
Our team received a lot of media attention especially due to our printer.
Media attention
Apart from telling our story on the national radio, we were featured in the written press. We appeared in the Physicus Applied Physics Article, the AD Delft Newspaper and the HRO Website. With all this media attention, we were motivated that we are working for a meaningful, interesting subject!
Radio:
3FM: We were on National radio to ask for people who can provide us KNEX, in the program, weekend wijnand

The K'NEX Story
In the Hardware page we explained how we arrived to the final design of our 3D Printer, The  Biolinker. Here you can read about our adventure in finding the pieces to build our Biolinker. This page also shows our media interaction with respect to our Biolinker: radio interviews and presence in newspaper, articles or websites. We were surprised to find so much enthusiasm for our project, and we hope that we made synthetic biology and bioprinting more well known to society.
Building the Biolinker was really exciting, but suddenly we had a practical problem: we didn’t have enough K’NEX to finish this design. With what we had until then, the printer could move on the X axis (structure on the left side of the picture). We ran out of K’NEX when working on the Y axis, the structure on the right side of the picture.
At first, we wanted to buy new K’NEX online. However, the packages specific to our needs were expensive . Thus, we decided to reach out to people via media on twitter, facebook, and radio. In a few minutes we had already retweets, and in no time we got an email from 3FM (national Dutch radio station) for a live request on national radio.  So Sunday morning we were live on the radio show Weekend Wijnand. Within an hour, Marijn van Iersel (an 11 year old boy () called the radio station, willing to donate us his K’NEX.
In the same day we were called from another radio station, Omroep West for an interview about our project in their morning show. We also featured on their website . Ever since the radio interviews we kept receiving emails from people all around the country willing to donate K’NEX. We’d like to thank them by adding their photos and short stories here.
Jaqueline Oolthuis. This very dedicated lady lives in Doetinchem. She was very interested in our project, sending us a crate of K’NEX. She was excited to see the printer when it is finished!
On the 18th of August we made a tour through South Holland to collect all the K’NEX.  It was very nice to see that so many people were interested in our project and willing to help. Jan was the first person who reacted on our twitter message. He works at Aerospace Engineering (TU Delft) and he had the specific red gears that we desperately needed.
Laura van Dijk. After Jan we drove to Den Hoorn. After getting lost a few times we finally found the right house. Here we found a 6 year old boy. His mother told us that he was bored of playing with the K’NEX within a few weeks. He definitely had no idea what cool stuff you can build with K’NEX, so we invited him to come by the office to see that.
Jelle Dijkstra. Then we travelled farther to Oegstgeest. At first, there was no one home. Jelle told us to that he had left the parts next to the front door. Luckily, he just came home when we found the package, so we could thank him personally.
Marjan Berkheij. We were already really satisfied with the amount of K’NEX we got, but when we arrived at the next address in Katwijk, we could not believe our eyes. Marjan had 5 boxes full with K'NEX. She told us her sons were already in their twenties, so they don’t use it anymore. She wanted to give it to charity, an orphanage for example, so we are going to look for a good charity organization to give it to.
Trees Prins.We drove already for a few hours through the Netherlands. For the last meeting we drove to Den Haag to Trees Prins. Now the car was full and we are ready to drive back to the office.
Leontien Smith and Max. On Friday Leontien Smith came by with her 12 year old son Max. We immediately saw that he was a real expert. He had a lot of ideas how we can improve the printer, so we sat down with him and started building. We really welcomed his advice. Afterwards, we gave him a tour through the building. He enjoyed the day very much, and so did we!
There were also people who brought the K'NEX to us, and could immediately have a look at the printer we’ve got so far. We’d like to thank Ronald Kest, Ina Venema and Iris Meijhorst for their donation!
Sorting the K’NEX
After we received everything, we started to sort through thousands of parts, some of which we didn’t know existed. We founds lots of useful parts and after sitting for a few hours with most of the team, we were done. The result was amazing, we had a sea of K’NEX to chose from for designing the perfect DIY 3D printer.
Donating to Charity
The K'NEX we received have been put to great use, as shown on the hardware page .Thanks to the generosity of so many people, we received far more K'NEX than we required. We would therefore like to put the ""left-over"" K'NEX to good use. We have already donated one of the printers to the Science Center of Delft , but we want to do more. Therefore  we have decided to donate the K'NEX to a suitable charity, so that others will be able to use their imagination and creativity to make whatever they desire.

Attributions
Each team must clearly attribute work done by the student team members on this page. The team must distinguish work done by the students from work done by others, including the host labs, advisors, instructors, and individuals not on the team roster.
Can we base our project on a previous one?
Yes! You can have a project based on a previous team, or based on someone else's idea, as long as you state this fact very clearly and give credit for the original project.
Why is this page needed?
The Attribution requirement helps the judges know what you did yourselves and what you had help with. We don't mind if you get help with difficult or complex techniques, but you must report what work your team did and what work was done by others.
For example, you might choose to work with an animal model during your project. Working with animals requires getting a license and applying far in advance to conduct certain experiments in many countries. This is difficult to achieve during the course of a summer, but much easier if you can work with a postdoc or PI who has the right licenses.
What should this page have?

All experiments conducted in this project has been designed, executed and analysed by members of the iGEM Group Stockholm. We, as iGEM Team Stockholm, are confidently standing behind the presented data. We have put a special effort not to modify the actual picture that we got by conducting our experiments in any way.
Our project has been developed independently from other projects. We are not really building up on a single project. We discovered that the iGEM Team from Dundee 2013 has been working with a chimeric version of the EnvZ as well. Therefore, we have analysed their project and adjusted our experiments accordingly. After request, we were also very happy to receive the EnvZ deficient E.Coli strain BW25113 from Dundee, in person of Frank Sargent and Chris Earl.
We have been also inspired by the work that has been already conducted with the OmpR signaling cascade. Notably, the former iGEM Teams from Technion Israel.

At this point, we would like to thank our supervisors who have been accompanying us throughout the entire project. They provided us with invaluable feedback at the weekly meetings, gave us new ideas and promoted our research. We are glad for their engagement for this student-driven research project and that they have been helping us not only scientifically but also administratively to get insurance and a laboratory facility in which we could perform our research.
Advisor
Roger Draheim, University of Portsmouth, is our primary advisor.
He has been formerly working at the Stockholm University and is an expert in the field of Osmoregulation via EnvZ-OmpR pathways. He has been independently conducting similar experiments as we have and we could thus compare our data to his results. Among these experiments, you can find the prediction of EnvZ (extracellular domain) and the characterization of the EnvZ gene in his expression vector from which we derived our EnvZ biobrick (BBa_1766008). In both given examples, we got to similar results and can therefore give a confident conclusion to these results presented. He has provided us with the MDG147 and EPB30 strains which have a genetically integrated YFP/CFP reporter system depending on the phosphorylation status of OmpR. We would like to thank Roger for his advice, feedback and constructive suggestions throughout the entire project.

Our story – founding iGEM Stockholm
Our journey started in January 2015, when 18 students from two universities and 12 countries banded together to combine biomedicine with bioengineering. Right from the start, we knew that if we combined the engineering of KTH, Royal Institute of Technology, with the biomedicine of the Karolinska Institute, we could do something truly unique. Since then, the power of diversity has been the core of our team.
We found four excellent supervisors, two from each university. At this point, we still had no lab and no money, and iGEM was still an unknown concept in Stockholm. We only knew that we wanted to work on the problem of detecting disease biomarkers at an early stage.
We started raising support. We met with university faculty, advisors, student union officials and company representatives. We pitched iGEM, synthetic biology and our project to students and professors. We held workshops at high schools and got in touch with media to raise awareness of synthetic biology outside academia. Our efforts paid off, and we managed to secure the  registration fee from KI and a lab space and equipment from KTH. To bring the team to Boston we kept pitching to companies and university faculties over the summer and also started a fundraising campaign. Our project was also featured on the front page of Karolinska Institutets website!
After securing the lab and registration fee, we could finally start developing the project. In April, we decided to work with protein biomarkers and to use intrinsic bacterial signal cascades for signal amplification. We spent the rest of April and May meeting on evenings and weekends to research different possibilities. Throughout the summer, we adapted the scope to our results and kept evolving the project. Our hypotheses, experiments and parts are described on the rest of this wiki.

From early on we knew that we wanted to collaborate with other teams around the world. During the spring we got in touch with as many teams as we could. Our first partner teams were Uppsala, Aalto-Helsinki and Pasteur Paris. We organized a Nordic meet-up with Uppsala for 60 students from eight teams, iGEM chairman Randy Rettberg honored us by attending the conference. With Aalto-Helsinki and Pasteur Paris we have discussed the need for digital collaboration platforms for iGEM. Later we got in touch with even more teams. We designed a membrane protein Biobrick with BGU Israel, wrote for the Amoy newsletter, collaborated with Zurich on characterization, sent materials to Freiburg and gave modeling tutorials to CGU Taiwan. Getting to know these teams has been a pleasure and we are looking forward to meeting even more great teams in Boston!
iGEM Stockholm will be back next year. We've built an organization that will last, and the alumni of this year’s team are determined to make sure that next year’s team will take of with a running start. We have founded an association and have started planning how to headhunt project leaders that will carry the torch. Our year has been an amazing experience. Thanks to everyone that has made this possible!
Meet the team
Felix Richter
Studies Biomedicine M.Sc at Karolinska Institutet
+ Three questions to Felix
What are your plans after university?
Revolutionizing the world! [REF]
Why did you join iGEM?
Same Same but Different! That is what iGEM can offer you… use the same parts but make something different. Who can’t resist?!
Let’s say you had to choose two celebrities to be your parents, who do you choose and why?
Helen Mirren, because she is incredible actress and incredibly British! And Andre Agassi, because he was one of the best tennis player in the world and he has quite a story to tell.
Katrine Horne Iversen
Studies Bioentrepreneurship M.Sc at Karolinska Institutet
+ Three questions to Katrine
What are your plans after university?
I have one year left on my master, but I’m still trying to figure out what I want to do after that. I love working with projects such as iGEM where you work on potential solutions for current and future problems and needs. I can imagine myself either working in a consulting company or potentially work in start-up/smaller companies within Life Science.
Why did you join iGem?
At my previous university, my class mates attended iGEM and it looked like a lot of fun as I like working in teams. I was surprised that Stockholm was not that active within the iGEM society. I think it is a great opportunity for me to use academic skills on a real-life case.
Your pet gains the ability to speak, what does he tell us about you?
Hmm, I actually have no idea, probably something like “I hate it when you rub my tummy”, or “give me more food”.
Naz Karadağ
Studies Biomedicine M.Sc at Karolinska Institutet
+ Three questions to Naz
What are your plans after university?
Considering a PhD but I’m not sure yet.
Why did you join iGEM?
It seemed like an interesting student initiative project. I wanted to help in a way.
Pick a song that describes your work ethic in the lab. Explain why:
Oops I did it again, because you always try to do your best, do everything exactly as the protocol says, yet somehow things might go wrong.
Utsa Karmakar
Studies Toxicology M.Sc at Karolinska Institutet
+ Three questions to Utsa
What are your plans after university?
I want to do PhD, that’s for sure. Eventually, it will end up in doing research and serving society as a medical doctor in parallel, I guess.
Why did you join iGEM?
While doing my medicine courses, I thought I would join research world as it seemed more interesting to me than just treating patients. That’s why I joined the toxicology master program. iGEM was a great opportunity to have close connection with the research world on synthetic biology and a nice way to spend the  beautiful Swedish summer with new people. Not to forget about the giant Jamboree in Boston, USA.
What food item/meal describes your life, and why?
Vat, dal and aluvate (typical bengali style rice, lentil and spicy mashed potato). It might not sound mouth watering or interesting but if you are on luxurious meal for a week, you will crave this cheap, simple and healthy meal!
Radosław Góra
Studies Toxicology M.Sc at Karolinska Institutet
+ Three questions to Radek
What are your plans after university?
I would like to continue my career in the scientific field as a PhD student, though I’m still unsure whether it will be an experimental research or something more connected computational biology. For the moment I’m working with biostatistics and I’m keen to continue doing this further on.
Why did you join iGEM?
I thought it would be a great idea to join the team of passionate, ambitious and enthusiastic students who are eager to sacrifice their summertime to do collaborative work aiming for life improvement. Also, the opportunity to go to Boston and meet the teams coming from all over the world seemed very appealing.
Your pet gains the ability to speak, what does he tell us about you?
“I’m gonna look for some food cause I’m really hungry. I haven’t eaten for 10 minutes now… omg this lazy guy is still in his bed watching movies on youtube. Look at his room, underwear in every corner, open books thrown on the floor, dirty dishes still there… this guy should really invest in cleaning personnel if he’s incapable of doing such a basic stuff… I’m really hungry. Wake up…! He fell asleep again… is he in lethargy or what…the same story again. Let’s go and sit on his face, that’s the only thing that can help improve my hopeless situation with this lazy freak.”
Carmen Gallo Álvarez
Studies Bioentrepreneurship M.Sc at Karolinska Institutet
+ Three questions to Carmen
What are your plans after university?
I hope to come back to my country soonish (although I said that 5 years ago already), and work in the Biotech sector. I get quite amazed by the stuff that are done in the field of green Biotechnology so I will probably try and make some company in the field believe that “amazed people” are good assets to have!
Why did you join iGEM?
Winter days in Stockholm are looooong and dark, you need to look for things that keep you inside and warm…I knew some bacteria had to be incubated at 37º which is quite a standard temperature in Spain, so I decided to give it a chance and feel like at home every time I am near the incubator! …And I actually do really hope to be some-little-how contributing to the scientific world :)
The zombie apocolypse breaks out-where do you go first?
Let me quickly see the Mediterranean Sea once more, and once my friends and I get infected I assume we will not be allowed in the labs anymore, so we can spend some solid amount of time seeing the rest of the world!
Manon Ricard
Studies Biomedicine B.Sc at Karolinska Institutet
+ Three questions to Manon
What are your plans after university?
I am only in the first year of my bachelor and therefore still have a lot of time to figure out what I would like to do after. Nevertheless, I would for sure pursue a master degree in the either Biomedicine or Bioentrepreneurship.
Why did you join iGEM?
I discovered iGEM when looking at prospective universities, some of which had an iGEM team. I have to say, I was a bit surprise to discover that KI nor any university in Stockholm had not participated into this very cool competition. When I heard that a team was going to be built up here, I jumped on the occasion !
If you could ride a dinosaur into battle, what kind would it be and why?
It would be a Ceratopsian. Because not only the horns of its face would look badass but they would also help me fight the enemy.

What are your plans after university?
No idea, but after iGEM i will an awesome party with all amazing people I have worked with in iGEM!
Why did you join iGEM?
I got interested in synthetic biology during a course in gene technology. A few weeks later I came in contact with the Stockholm iGEM team and off course I applied!
What food item/meal describes your life, and why?
The spice/herb Perforate St John’s-wort would describe my life. It’s found indigenous in Europe but gan be grown in more temperate places of the world. (I like being on vacation). It is used as a antidepressant (I like having fun) and is traditionally used to fought off evil (doing iGEM cancer detection). And it’s a good spice for making Brännvin. (I like crayfish parties.)

+ Three questions to Max
What are your plans after university?
To work with medical biotechnological applications, like detection or therapy of advanced diseases.
Why did you join iGEM?
As it is a fantastic opportunity to try working in a real biotechnological/synthetic biology project which actually focuses on my areas of interest. Also it is a great compliment to the, in comparison, rather awkward bachelors project we do at KTH. No offence against the projects themselves, but you only get that far with a purely theoretical project.
Your pet gains the ability to speak, what does he tell us about you?
Nothing until he gets his lawyer there, that’s for sure!

+ Three questions to Pontus
What are your plans after university?
I am really looking forward to working with research in medical biotechnology. It will be nice to earn some actual money. Alternatively I will start a PhD if I can find anything that I am super excited about.
Why did you join iGEM?
For me it seemed like a valuable opportunity to get some hands-on experience in a life science project. Also I found it a great opportunity to get settled into the laboratory environment which will be useful later. I would like to add that after years of studying its nice to get somewhere and see the product of your own invested time. To have an opportunity to test you own ideas and work with other interested people is truly awesome.

+ Three questions to Hugi
What are your plans after university?
Long-term: Help to terraform Mars with biotechnology. Short-term: Hopefully a few programming projects I’ve wanted to get into. Also, finish my degree and get more into bioinformatics and data.
Why did you join iGEM?
I’ve wanted to join an iGEM team since 2009, and iGEM is actually the reason for why I decided on biotechnology in the first place. Since there has never been an iGEM team at KTH, I actually thought of starting one before I found this group.
If you could ride a dinosaur into battle, what kind would it be and why?
A quetzalcoatlus, because it’s spelling would greatly confuse my enemies, and because it’s a mindbogglingly enormous flying dinosaur with a 10-meter wingspan !
Shea Baxley
Studies Biomedicine B.Sc at Karolinska Institutet
+ Three questions to Shea
What are your plans after university?
To study until I’m 80. Or maybe at leasts a master’s and phD
Why did you join iGEM?
Because I really felt like I needed more lab experience. It became so much more than that afterwards though. It became like hanging out and having fun with some work on the side
Let’s say normal people and their talents are now considered super powers: what would be your superhero name?
Foot in mouth girl, because I have a real talent for saying the most inappropriate/offensive things at the worst times.
Sarah Wideman
Studies Biomedicine B.Sc at Karolinska Institutet
+ Three questions to Sarah
What are your plans after university?
I want to do biomedical research in different places all over the world!
Why did you join iGEM?
I joined iGEM because it seemed really interesting to be a part of a student driven project. I also liked the idea of getting to know the international iGEM community. Of course, for a Bachelor’s student the lab experience is also invaluable.
The zombie apocolypse breaks out-where do you go first?
My family has a cabin on a small island without any other inhabitants. I guess I would go there. It’s isolated and lot of my family members are hunters, so there’s lots of guns! Either that or just embrace the end of the world and go party.
Denise Strand
Studies Biomedicine B.Sc at Karolinska Institutet
+ Three questions to Denise
What are your plans after university?
In the future I hope to continue studying and do research within the biomedical field.
Why did you join iGEM?
When I first signed up for iGem, all I knew was that it’s a competition in synthetic biology. I wanted to work in a lab over the summer and didn’t think too much about it until we started planning for the actual project and it hit me that we were going to design this system on our own, and were free to do practically anything.
Pick a song that describes your work ethic in the lab. Explain why:
Gotta go with the ‘Still Alive’-theme song from Portal 2, because there’s no sense crying over every mistake,              you just keep on trying ’til you run out of cake.             And the science gets done             so we can diagnose a lung             from the read-out of our E.Coli
Karol Kugiejko
Studies Biomedicine M.Sc at Karolinska Institutet
+ Three questions to Karol
What are your plans after university?
In future I would like to be mostly focused on Stem Cells and Biomaterials in regard to their interplay in biological systems. Neverteless I am also interested in Cell Biology, Regenerative Medicine, Tissue Engineering and Neurobiology. I consider knowledge from this fields being a natural consequence of my fascination on Stem Cells. Therefore essential for my education and career. Nonetheless, I love Research in-between Biology and Engineering, I believe that in the world of Science elasticity and fast adaptation are the most important features. Therefore, I am trying to be a part of different projects and research fields if possible. In simple words, I think PhD or work for a company connected with my plans would be perfect.
Why did you join iGEM?
It seems to be really nice and interactive student initiative. I hoped to learn how to work in a new and challenging environment on something, which is totally new for me.
Pick a song that describes your work ethic in the lab. Explain why:
""Varsovie"" by Brodka, because in Science you always discover something new, like you can discover Warsaw each time you visit this city. Moreover, the motto of Warsaw is ""Semper Invicta"" which means ""Always Invincible"", and you should always keep in mind not to give up in research.
Mona Hassan
Studies Biotechnology M.Sc at KTH Royal Institute of Technology
+ Three questions to Mona
What are your plans after university?
I am studying the master program medical biotechnology.
Why did you join iGEM?
I joined iGEM because of the amazing opportunity to get an insight in what it is like to be working as a scientist, to see the whole process from idea to the final product.
Pick a song that describes your work ethic in the lab. Explain why:
II would pick the song ""You're the best"" by Joe Esposito. It is about keep fighting no matter what, to take one day at a time and to never lose focus. At least that is what I aim for.

We would like to thank everyone who has had a contributing role in the completion of our iGEM project. From the initial inception, through development and and at each apparent dead-end, we’ve been lucky enough to have a range of fantastic support and guidance. We also want to give thanks to everyone at iGEM for granting us this unique opportunity.
Special thanks to:
Dr. George Wadhams
For being a guidance to all 14 members of the Oxford iGEM team throughout the summer, and being incredibly patient with us in the wet lab! As our main supervisor, he has been the cornerstone of our project, providing invaluable assistance on construct design and experimental approach, as well as advice on the Wiki and presentation.
Dr. Chris Jones
For supervising our project and providing day to day contact for experimental troubleshooting. He has been a brilliant supervisor, explaining many complex protocols to us in an easily-understandable manner. We have learnt a great deal from him, especially in relation to microscopy and data analysis.
Professor Judy Armitage
For letting us come into her lab to complete the project under her supervision.
Professor Anthony Watts
Provided support and contact on behalf of the biochemistry department, specifically in relation to securing facilities such as lab space and access to equipment.

Andreas Harris
For helping us set the course for our modelling section and explaining concepts to us when we were lost.
Professor James Malone-Lee
For giving his honest,  professional opinion on our project and its place in medicine. For giving us access to his clinic to speak with Doctors and patients as  much as we needed to. Perhaps most importantly for inspiring team member George to continue work on urinary infections through his generous internship scheme.
Dr. Sheela Swamy
For replying to our queries in under an hour without fail, for welcoming George into her consultations to talk to patients, for working hard to make sure George got answers to every question he wanted to ask and most importantly for protecting George from the patients who want to get in and out of the clinic without disturbance.
Laura Evans and Jan Harris
For being so accomodating and providing us with great insight to the treatment of UTIs.
Jessica Martyn
For advice and support in the early stages of the project and assistance with the presentation design. Also most importantly for coming up with our project name!
Nasir Ahmad
For providing much needed support and advice based on his own previous iGEM experience.  Particularly with regard to the presentation and how best to tell our projects story.
Also thanks to:
Andrea Szollossi
For offering design advice on constructing infographic images figures, which have been a great asset to our poster and Wiki. We have relied entirely on Andrea to provide us with our Western Blotting protocol, and tutoring us so that we can (just about) do it properly! Also, it has been great to have her to cheer us up on a daily basis!
Matt Smith
For giving us the best advice possible on protein purification & characterisation, introducing us to the finest Bolivian liquors, and showing us that you can never wear too much stash!
Thomas Folliard
For providing advice on increasing the efficiency of our molecular cloning protocols, including improving our PCR and Ligation steps. Tom has gone out of his way to aid many of us in the understanding of primer design, and has shown us the art of Gibson assembly - a technique we were sadly unable to pursue.
Dr. Andreas Diepold
For continuously restocking us with plasmids, ensuring that we are not thrown out of the lab for breaching safety rules and giving infinite amounts of advice on secretion.
Katy Austin
For putting us in touch with the right people to get an interview at BBC Radio Oxford. This was one of our main outreach events, and allowed Mabel to tick something off her bucket list!
Eleanor Taylor
A Bang! magazine artist Eleanor designed a number of graphics for our project. These included drawings of the Biofilm and a graphical representation of our projects mechanism of action. These added to the aesthetic appeal of of our Wiki.
Christina Rode
Produced some beautiful artwork and graphics for our project. Find more of her work here: http://www.christinarode.com/
Steve Dinsdale
For his help regarding the potential manufacture plans.
James Scott-Brown and Thomas Prescott
For their help with the modelling section of our project.
Dr. Andrew McBain
For his talk on biofilms.
Professor Timothy K. Lu and Professor Jef Boeke
For offering his thoughts on our project.
Max Crispin
For raising the question of the impact on the urinary biome.
Dr. Paul Driscoll
For being responsible for the conception and upbringing of one of our team members and for liking EVERY. SINGLE. ONE. of our tweets and facebook posts.

Biochemistry
I’ve been responsible for the designs behind the kill switches. I’ve contributed in the wet lab, mainly in molecular cloning, and in particular, with the Synbiota parts. Additionally, I’ve been active in our outreach part of the project, making presentations for GCSE students, and writing our blog.
Helen
Brown
Biochemistry
I’ve been working on considerations of project safety, including physical containment and kill switch options, as well as ensuring that lab practices follow the safety protocols outlined by our demonstrator. I’ve also been in the wet lab, focussing mainly on molecular cloning. I’ve helped in outreach as well, helping to create presentations for summer schools, and helping to promote our project on social media. Finally, I’ve helped to code up the wiki.
Ria
Dinsdale
Chemistry
As chief chemist I have been in charge of making beads to encapsulate the bacteria (and vodka) as well as having far too much fun making up litres and litres of fluorescent solutions. I have been part of the interface between the wet-lab and the modeling by producing experimental data on the diffusion rates out of the beads. Along with my time in the wet-lab I have contributed to ensuring all of our content is coded up for the wiki; as well as taking artsy pictures for the headers.
George
Driscoll
Biochemistry
Last summer I spent six weeks interning in a UTI clinic and laboratory, and so this summer I’ve spent 13 weeks attempting to destroy the very part of those those patients’ urine samples that brought me such happiness. In particular, I engaged in Human Practices outreach with Doctors and patients at the only UTI clinic in the country and when not doing that I threw a little of my fairy stardust onto the wet lab in the form of PCRs and Cell culturing as well as secret handshakes.
Silas
Elliot
Biology
I've been involved mostly with outreach and public engagement. This has been through the production of videos and visits to a local hospital. I've also been part of the day to day work in the wetlab, as well as helping design assets for the poster, presentation and wiki.
James
Fage
Biology
As our friendly neighbourhood biologist I’ve been looking into how our final product might interact with the ecology of the urinary tract microbiome and the immune system, as well as whether such problems might be tractable within the scope of our project. I have also been working regularly in the wet-lab, with my focus being on toxicity and biofilm assays.
June Juyeon
Han
Biochemistry
I’ve been mainly working on culture and image taking of interlab fluorescence microscopy, as well as loading fluorescence and toxicity 96 well assay and retrieving data for them. I have helped in policy & practice section of our project by contacting and meeting synthetic biology experts to comment on our project.
Henry
Howard-Jenkins
Engineering
I am a member of the modeling duo and have designed and built our team's wiki. Working in the shadow of Will, star of viral sensation; Modeling with Will, I have been producing gene-expression and diffusion models. Additionally, I have helped with outreach and interviews for our practices section.
Raphaella
Hull
Biochemistry
Leader from the start similar to that of a deity it might be difficult to overstate the contribution made to this project by Raffy. An avid reader of literature during project choice and development and a master biobrick builder on SnapGene Raffy’s contribution continued through to the practical fulfillment of our ideas. Even if she is covert in her acquisition of coffee from Elaine’s office she was not with her hard work in the lab, on the wiki and in organising us as a team.
Leon
Kong
Chemistry
Despite his degree designation clearly stating ""Chemistry"", Leon has long fallen to the dark side since taking iGEM on and now chiefly regards himself as a synthetic biologist through-and-through.
When Raffy is occupied with other engagements, the helm of the team is typically Leon's to take up, but being the team's resident lab nerd/guru he'd mostly rather be left alone by the bench to think about new experiments. Leon was the mastermind behind the bulk of the experimental molecular and microbiology, having been responsible for the literature review and BioBrick design together with Raffy since the project's inception, all the way through to the planning, delegation, and execution of the characterization experiments for the genetic constructs along with the associated data analyses.
Lychee
Lu
Biochemistry
When not growing on trees, I am usually somewhere in the lab running microscopy and plate reader experiments for the interlab study and processing the subsequent data. Have also attempted to make contact with teams in other countries for collaboration efforts; these attempts bore fruits on a few occasions as can be viewed on our collaborations page.
Duke
Quinton
Biochemistry
Over the summer I have been working regularly in the wet lab, particularly on cloning procedure and Western Blotting. I have been writing articles for our blog page, including a piece on the first GM human embryo. I have designed our project poster, as well as coded various elements of the wiki. My favourite outreach experience was talking to UNIQ summer school, and seeing what they thought of our project!
Will
Van Duzer
Physics
As the second member of the modeling crew - and physicist-in-residence - you’ll either find me preaching to the biochemists about error bars or coding up our gene expression and diffusion models. I also helped present a workshop on synthetic biology.
Mabel
Wong
Biochemistry
Thanks to lab experience prior to iGEM, I was the team's chief molecular cloner.  When not reigning as the Miniprep Queen, I made initial contact with local hospitals, taught at the UNIQ summer school workshop and successfully avoided making agarose gels with water.  This holding of royal office culminated in being on BBC Radio for a grand total of 7 minutes on the day of the lab’s electrical shutdown.
Advisors
Dr George
Wadhams
Supervisor
George Wadhams’ research interests lie in how bacteria sense and integrate environmental information. His group focuses on understanding in a quantitative manner how multiple, homologous pathways operate in individual cells and how the components of these pathways can be used to create synthetic pathways.
Dr Chris
Jones
Supervisor
For optimum growth bacteria must adapt to their environment, one way to do this is by moving towards advantageous conditions. To do this they must be able to both move and to control the direction of that movement. The signaling pathways that control this directionality form into large arrays of receptors and kinases. The best studied arrays contain transmembrane receptors, however many species also contain arrays that are non-transmembrane and therefore in the cytoplasm. My work focuses on the cytoplasmic chemoreceptor array of Rhodobacter sphaeroides. Looking at both how the array is formed and stabilised without the presence of a membrane and how the array is split and segregated prior to cell division insuring faithful inheritance of the complete chemotaxis pathway.
Professor Judy
Armitage
Advisor
Judy Armitage is interested in the dynamics of bacterial sensory transduction and the control of bacterial motility. In particular, her research group focuses on the communication between the sensory and adaption mechanisms of the two pathways as a model for sensory network integration in general..
Professor Anthony
Watts
Advisor
Anthony Watts’ group is devising solid state NMR methods for determining high-resolution details of information-rich sites within membrane receptors. Recent focus has been on the neurotensin receptor (NTS1), which is now available highly purified and monodispersed in detergent as well as in a ligand-binding form.
Professor Antonis
Papachristodoulou
Advisor
Antonis Papachristodoulou’s research interests include systems and synthetic biology, network systems, aerospace systems and flow control, and convex optimisation. Furthermore, he works on modern control theory, robust stability analysis and design, as well as nonlinear dynamical systems and Lyapunov stability.
Andreas
Harris
Advisor
Andreas Harris works on the design and implementation of gene regulatory networks harnessing feedback to increase robustness and tunability. The designs are based around transcriptional networks and attempt to translate well-understood control modules, such as proportional and integral controllers, to biological systems.

""The greatest team the University of Michigan has produced since the Fab Five""
I'm Josh Abramson, one of the team's co-founders and the current president. Hailing from West Bloomfield, I've made a living studying Biology, Mathematics, and Chemical Physics at the University of Michigan.   Before leading the software team, I was on the Michigan lab team for 4 years as a member and 1 year as an advisor.  Outside of iGEM, I enjoy tree climbing, playing pranks on my professors, and computer games.
Hi, my name is Hy Doan and I am from Grand Rapids, Michigan. I am junior studying Computer Science. In my free time, I enjoy playing/listening to jazz, exercising, and destroying friendships while playing Settlers of Catan (or any other board game). Along with school, I am in Groove Performance Group, an awesome percussion group, and I volunteer with Ready Set Start, teaching music workshops.
I am Graham, a senior at U of M, studying Molecular Biology and Computer Science. I enjoy fishing, hiking, and playing settlers of Catan. I wanted ProtoCat to be called ProtoDog but that wouldn't make any sense.
Hi, my name is Max Gittelman. I am a Junior studying Computer Science at U of M. I enjoy eating pizza at team meetings and allowing my younger twin brother to copy whatever I do. I fortunately am a dog person and highly recommended the name “Protodog” but the name was quickly struck down due to its non puniness. Also Graham steals jokes.
Hi, my name is Zachary Gittelman and I am a Junior studying Computer Science Engineering. I am from Miami, Florida and my interest in biotech has lead me to join the BioSoft team. Additionally, I am on the Michigan Autonomous Aerial Vehicles team and I enjoy learning about AI, running, skiing, and mimicking my twin Max. And remember, if you’re not the first cat, you’re the last cat.
Hi, I'm Ali Hammoud. I'm a junior at the University of Michigan majoring in biochemistry and computer science. I spend a lot of my time studying for classes and working in a clinical research lab, but in my spare time I enjoy cooking and spending time with friends.
Hello, I’m Ali Turfah. I am a sophomore and I plan to major in a form of Engineering. In my spare time, I enjoy designing as well as building costumes, playing video games, and studying languages, both spoken and computer. I have two cats, so I’m really excited about the ProtoCat designs.
I am Mary Weber, a junior from East Lansing, Michigan majoring in Informatics, with a concentration in life-science. I am interested in data analysis, particularly in regards to its role in improving the efficiency and accuracy of health systems. Outside of school, I love spending time outdoors and am a frequent visitor to the Arboretum and the Kerrytown Farmer’s Market.
Hi, I'm Katherine Williams. I am a sophomore in computer science from Hudsonville, MI. Besides the iGEM team, I am in a game development club called WolverineSoft and the Harry Potter Alliance at the University of Michigan. I enjoy playing piano and reading in my free time.
I am Campbell Yore, a patent agent registered with the United States Patent and Trademark Office and a third year law student at Santa Clara University School of Law. My technical background is in organic chemistry and bioelectronic materials. Biology is Technology, a book by Robert Karelson, introduced me to iGEM and the possibilities of synthetic biology and I've been hooked ever since. Collaborating with other groups, learning about biological circuit design, and advocating for student entrepreneurs are my favorite parts of participating in iGEM.

Project Design
Jennifer Knister was inspired to develop an adaptable protein detection switch after hearing Keith Pardee’s seminar at U of M and proposed the project to the team and advisors.  Jenn led team members on a handful of switch design meetings, and Nick Emery found the FRET switch in the Nutiu paper.  Together, Nick and Jenn designed the switches and came up with various versions (different stem length, different amounts of aptamer exposed, etc) to test, and ordered the nucleotide sequences from Integrated DNA Technologies (IDT).  The switch design work was done on and off, May – September.

TEAM
Michigan Biological Software
""The greatest team the University of Michigan has produced since the Fab Five""
I'm Josh Abramson, one of the team's co-founders and the current president. Hailing from West Bloomfield, I've made a living studying Biology, Mathematics, and Chemical Physics at the University of Michigan. Before leading the software team, I was on the Michigan lab team for 4 years as a member and 1 year as an advisor. Outside of iGEM, I enjoy tree climbing, playing pranks on my professors, and computer games.
Hi, my name is Hy Doan and I am from Grand Rapids, Michigan. I am junior studying Computer Science. In my free time, I enjoy playing/listening to jazz, exercising, and destroying friendships while playing Settlers of Catan (or any other board game). Along with school, I am in Groove Performance Group, an awesome percussion group, and I volunteer with Ready Set Start, teaching music workshops.
I am Graham, a senior at U of M, studying Molecular Biology and Computer Science. I enjoy fishing, hiking, and playing settlers of Catan. I wanted ProtoCat to be called ProtoDog but that wouldn't make any sense.
Hi, my name is Max Gittelman. I am a Junior studying Computer Science at U of M. I enjoy eating pizza at team meetings and allowing my younger twin brother to copy whatever I do. I fortunately am a dog person and highly recommended the name “Protodog” but the name was quickly struck down due to its non puniness. Also Graham steals jokes.
Hi, my name is Zachary Gittelman and I am a Junior studying Computer Science Engineering. I am from Miami, Florida and my interest in biotech has lead me to join the BioSoft team. Additionally, I am on the Michigan Autonomous Aerial Vehicles team and I enjoy learning about AI, running, skiing, and mimicking my twin Max. And remember, if you’re not the first cat, you’re the last cat.
Hi, I'm Ali Hammoud. I'm a junior at the University of Michigan majoring in biochemistry and computer science. I spend a lot of my time studying for classes and working in a clinical research lab, but in my spare time I enjoy cooking and spending time with friends.
Hello, I’m Ali Turfah. I am a sophomore and I plan to major in a form of Engineering. In my spare time, I enjoy designing as well as building costumes, playing video games, and studying languages, both spoken and computer. I have two cats, so I’m really excited about the ProtoCat designs.
I am Mary Weber, a junior from East Lansing, Michigan majoring in Informatics, with a concentration in life-science. I am interested in data analysis, particularly in regards to its role in improving the efficiency and accuracy of health systems. Outside of school, I love spending time outdoors and am a frequent visitor to the Arboretum and the Kerrytown Farmer’s Market.
Hi, I'm Katherine Williams. I am a sophomore in computer science from Hudsonville, MI. Besides the iGEM team, I am in a game development club called WolverineSoft and the Harry Potter Alliance at the University of Michigan. I enjoy playing piano and reading in my free time.
I am Campbell Yore, a patent agent registered with the United States Patent and Trademark Office and a third year law student at Santa Clara University School of Law. My technical background is in organic chemistry and bioelectronic materials. Biology is Technology, a book by Robert Karelson, introduced me to iGEM and the possibilities of synthetic biology and I've been hooked ever since. Collaborating with other groups, learning about biological circuit design, and advocating for student entrepreneurs are my favorite parts of participating in iGEM.

Attributions
Each team must clearly attribute work done by the student team members on this page. The team must distinguish work done by the students from work done by others, including the host labs, advisors, instructors, and individuals not on the team roster.
Can we base our project on a previous one?
Yes! You can have a project based on a previous team, or based on someone else's idea, as long as you state this fact very clearly and give credit for the original project.
Why is this page needed?
The Attribution requirement helps the judges know what you did yourselves and what you had help with. We don't mind if you get help with difficult or complex techniques, but you must report what work your team did and what work was done by others.
For example, you might choose to work with an animal model during your project. Working with animals requires getting a license and applying far in advance to conduct certain experiments in many countries. This is difficult to achieve during the course of a summer, but much easier if you can work with a postdoc or PI who has the right licenses.

About the team
SJTU is short for Shanghai JiaoTong University, one of the most famous universities in China. Known for its  abundant teaching resources and cutting-end scientific researching level. SJTU not only keep its edge on traditional advantage fields like naval architecture, engineering and electronic, but also make great progress in fields like life science, medicine, finance and so on.  Though the school of life science and biotechnology of SJTU does not has a long history, it has developed dramastically during these years, especially bioinformatics, which ranks first in China.
SJTU first had software team in 2014. This year, we have a brand-new software team: the 2015 SJTU software team. Our team is supported by the school of life science and biotechnology. Three professors of our this school became our mentors who helped us to organize the team and provided us with helpful advices. The team members are most from Bioinformatics. Some from the school of electronic, information and electrical engineering and one is from the school of media and design. The combination of students from different majors let our team be more creative and efficient.
We spend most of our time finishing the software in the bioinformatics computer room where we can use computer and Internet freely and close to mentors’ offices. Here we have some pictures about our daily work situation. Although the summer in Shanghai is hot and sometimes coding was boring and drove us crazy when we had to work 24/7 for the deadline.

Liu Liang Jie, as the captain, set up the whole team under the help of Jiabei Yang (Jiabei Yang is the captain of 2014 SJTU Software team) and developed a rigorous work schedule for the team to ensure the successful progress of project. With the help of the instructors and the college, he found a certain amount of financial support ensuring the logistics work.
Liu Chang is responsible for some of the logistics work, customized personalized uniforms and arranged suitable time and place to carry out weekly seminars. The souvenir bracelet we give you also came from his work.
Lin Hao and Chen Jun provided the idea of our project, which is the base of everything. At the time we finished BASE, they made a detailed help documents for us, thus helping users to have a better and faster understanding of our software.
Pi Yunlong and Yuxiao Peng are mainly responsible for the foreign exchange and communication and part of human practice work. They got to know many students from other teams and strengthened our cooperation with them.
Chen Keyu and Jin Jiajun produced almost all of the web pages including our wiki and the software website interface.
Huang Wenze, Gao Qi and Zhang Huamin have strong basic knowledge in biology. They created the algorithms which are the soul of BASE. At the same time, they used mysql to build the back-end database. More than 20,000 records about biobricks in standard biobrick database were fetched. Besides, they used perl language to build the background.
Chen Ming took part in the iGEM competition last year, she helped the captain promote the process of the entire project. Since she has the most comprehensive understanding of the project, she contrived to design the content and structure of the wiki and wrote most of the contents.
Zhangyue He and Yuting Dai are very good at UI design. They designed all our poster and the interface of our sotfware and wiki.They also helped us make the user guide video."

Circular mRNA ver.2.0
In last year, we succeeded in designing the sequence which synthesizes circular mRNA and long chain protein in Escherichia coli.
In this year, we had 2 purposes in our study. One was an efficiency of the circularization. The efficiency was lower in our previous study. This was why the splicing was hard to happen because two sequences to act as ribozyme for splicing were far each other. So we incorporated complementary sequences around the ribozyme regions. We thought that the treatment brought two regions close and the efficiency of the circularization improved.
The other was to synthesize useful proteins. In our previous study, synthesized long-chain proteins lose their function because the folding of the proteins was broken. So we incorporated linker sequences into circular mRNA to synthesize the functional long-chain protein.

Within our group, we organized ourselves in smaller groups in order to use our working power efficiently. The distribution of the work was done during the first meetings but it changed during the realization of the project according to the needs. Besides the work done by our team, we needed external help to perform some techniques.
Arranging finances and finding sponsors
In order to approach our potential sponsors, we created a sponsoring proposal to send around. Bastian, Bo and Carolin took care of sending numerous E-mails and making uncountable calls to companies. At a bonding fare in Dresden Bastian, Bo, Ashwin, and Marvin contacted further companies. We had the opportunity to meet some of the interested institutions. Bastian, Bo, and Sethu attended these meetings representing the whole team. Juliane Hoth from the BIOTEC was responsible to connect our financial platform with the sponsors. Additionally Andrea Dünnebier helped us arranging the flights and accomodation to attend the Giant Jamboree.
Wetlab work
Correct folding study of target protein: This subproject involved three people: Sethu, Abhinaya, and Ashwin. The target protein chosen for our project was HER2 and they made the necessary analysis to characterize its structure. Dr. Sofia Traikov from the Hoflack’s lab and Dr. Sivaraman Subramaniam from Stewart's lab (BIOTEC) helped them with the protein purification. In order to perform the circular dichroism spectroscopy we used the help of the Schlierf’s lab (B-Cube).
Investigation of P3 threshold for E. coli resistance: Carolin and Bastian successfully cloned the resistance E. coli needed. This subproject also involved Carl and Robert, who took care of performing the resistance experiments.
Conversion of BACTH into an iGEM standard and analysis of function: Bo was responsible for this subproject. He later converted the BACTH system into an iGEM standard.
Set up of flow system: Carl and Robert got involved in the design of the setup for our project and subprojects.
Biobrick assembly: Marvin cloned the biobricks in the correct plasmid.
Simulations and structure analysis
Melanie was responsible for the bioinformatics part of the project. Therefore she characterized the interaction interface between HER2 and the affibody.
Wiki
Romina took care of the designing of the Wiki and organized its content. However all the information needed to fill the necessary sections was distributed between all the team members.
Video
We came up with the idea of the video through several improvised sessions of brainstorming. Carolin, Bastian, Bo, Marvin, Sethu, Ashwin, Romina, Carl and Abhinaya recorded the scenes for the video, but the assembly was done by Bo’s sister, Joyna Heinz. Another Heinz, Avien composed the music for the occasion.
Acknowledgments
We would like to express our gratitude to everyone who supported us during this experience; to Prof. Thomas Mascher, Robert Braun and Julia Bartels for their advices as iGEM veterans; to Prof. Francis Stewart’s group for providing us with lab space, materials, economical support for the flights of Frank, and for responding every question we had; to Georg Krainer for his help during the CD measurements; to Dr. Jun Fu for this help in the design of the plasmids we needed; to Prof. Thomas Bley for letting us work in his lab and supporting us financially;to PD Dr. Christian Löser for helping us with his knowledge and supplying us with his lab material; to the whole Institute for Food and Bioprocess Engineering for helping us with all our questions and lab work; to Prof. David R.

About Us
Our team consists of 11 students and 2 supervisors (Jana Herrmann and Frank Groß). We are biologists, bioengineers and biochemists. If you want to know a little bit more about us, you can read some information on this site.
Jana
Jana studied Molecular Biotechnology in Dresden and Munich. From biophysics to biochemistry to chemistry, she has been working on projects in different disciplines. However, her favorite discipline has always been Molecular Bioengineering. Therefore, she is happy to support the TU Dresden team to get SPACE-P into the orbit of iGEM. Being outside the lab, she enjoys the nature while hiking or cycling, and for working off energy – if something is left at the end of a busy week – she likes playing badminton. She says: “The iGEM competition is a great opportunity for the students to get a feeling of what it takes to plan and perform a project (also from the organizational and financial side) and to realize that having know-how is beneficial, but having a good network is as important.”
Frank
Frank studied biology at the Universtät Hohenheim and got his PhD at the TU Dresden. After three years as a postdoc with Syngenta at the Research Triangle Park, North Carolina, USA, he returned to Germany. He is interested in natural products, molecular bioengineering and lately in epigenetics due to group affiliation. “To be asked by the students to supervise the Dresden iGEM team is a honor. It was and is a hard learning process for all of us, since we are all novices in the iGEM hemisphere. Nevertheless, this project is a great opportunity for them to learn how science functions: planning a project, writing proposals to get funding and finally realizing the plans at the bench in the wet lab and present the results.”
Abhinaya
This 26 years old from Chennai (India) with a major in Biotechnology is a downright protein enthusiast. Casual, determinant and exuberance perfectly define her. This former IT professional finds utmost comfort in mixing research and technology and loves being on the edge! Music, adventure and anime is her mantra for personal time out, occasionally with a dash of spiritual salvation involving yoga and meditation. According to her iGEM is ""one helluva ride! Brilliant but scary..."".

Within our group, we organized ourselves in smaller groups in order to maximize our work force. The distribution of the work was done during the first meetings but it changed during the development of the project according to changing needs. Besides the work done by our team, we needed external help to perform some techniques.
Arranging finances and finding sponsors
In order to approach our potential sponsors, we created a sponsoring proposal to send around. Bastian, Bo and Carolin took care of sending numerous E-mails and making uncountable calls to companies. At a bonding fare in Dresden, Bastian, Bo, Ashwin, and Marvin contacted further companies. We had the opportunity to meet some of the interested institutions. Bastian, Bo, and Sethu attended these meetings and Bastian and Bo gave presentations, representing the whole team. Juliane Hoth from the BIOTEC was responsible to connect our financial platform with the sponsors. Additionally Andrea Dünnebier helped us arranging the flights and accommodation to attend the Giant Jamboree.
Plasmids design
The plasmid components for the BioBricks were designed by Bastian. Plasmid design for major compartments were done by Marvin and Abhinaya. The design and modeling of the plasmids was assisted by Dr. Jun Fu. All Biobrick plasmids were synthesized from IDT.
Simulations and structure analysis
Melanie was responsible for the bioinformatics part of the project. Therefore she analyzed the structures and characterized the interaction interface between HER2 and the affibody.
Wetlab work
Folding study of target protein: This subproject involved three people: Abhinaya, Ashwin, and Sethu. The target protein chosen for our project was HER2 and they made the necessary analysis to characterize its structure. Dr. Sofia Traikov from the Hoflack lab (BIOTEC) and Dr. Sivaraman Subramaniam from Stewart's lab (BIOTEC) helped them with the protein purification. In order to perform the circular dichroism spectroscopy we used the help of the Schlierf lab (B-Cube).
Investigation of P3 threshold for E. coli resistance: Carolin and Bastian successfully cloned the resistance E. coli needed. This subproject also involved Carl and Robert, who took care of performing the resistance experiments.
Conversion of BACTH into an iGEM standard and analysis of function: Bo was responsible for designing this subproject. He was later relieved by Sethu, Abhinaya, and Ashwin. Dr. Jun Fu helped them when designing the plasmids used.
Set up of flow system: Carl and Robert got involved in the design of the setup for our project and subprojects.
Biobrick assembly: Marvin cloned the biobricks in the correct plasmid.
Wiki
Romina took care of the designing of the Wiki and organized its content. However all the information needed to fill the necessary sections was distributed between all the team members. Sethu is the artist who drew all the nice drawings for the Wiki.
Video
We came up with the idea of the video through several improvised sessions of brainstorming. Carolin, Bastian, Bo, Marvin, Sethu, Ashwin, Romina, Carl and Abhinaya recorded the scenes for the video, but the assembly was done by Bo’s sister, Joyna Heinz, and himself. Another Heinz, Avien composed the music for the occasion.
Acknowledgments
We would like to express our gratitude to everyone who supported us during this experience; to Prof. Thorsten Mascher, Robert Braun and Julia Bartels for their advices as iGEM veterans; to Prof. Francis Stewart’s group for providing us with lab space, materials, economical support for the flights of Frank, and for responding every question we had; to Georg Krainer for his help during the CD measurements; to Dr. Jun Fu for this help in the design of the plasmids we needed; to Prof. Thomas Bley for letting us work in his lab and supporting us financially;to PD Dr. Christian Löser for helping us with his knowledge and supplying us with his lab material; to the whole Institute for Food and Bioprocess Engineering for helping us with all our questions and lab work; to Prof. David R. Liu's group from Harvard University for their material supplies; to Parvathy Subramanian for editing the drawings and make them look better.

Tsinghua iGEM 2015 is a warm and lovely  team. We got to be familiar with each other since this team formed in the  November of 2014. Brainstorming and inchoate experiment design divided us into  small groups in order to carry forward the project efficiently, which in  addition enabled us to exchange a lot of ideas. Though we did not stay in the  campus all the time during summer vacation, we did the experiments in turn as  well as recorded the contents and results of the experiments as detailed as  possible so that the project schedule would be kept progressing. Under this  circumstance, we tried our best to guarantee everyone’s attending the team  meeting every week by utilizing SKYPE. We think together, design together and  work together. In this way, Tsinghua iGEM 2015 team totally have faith in and  realized the spirit of iGEM that has been spread all over the world.

All fundraising help including trip to Boston, registration fees and reagents was kindly provided by Dr. Damira Kanayeva.
As instructors both Dr.Damira Kanayeva and Dr. Olena Filchakova were helpful at advising and checking the progress on project.
Prof. Gonzalo Hortelano provided our team with access to labs for all summer.
General idea of the project was given by Mukhtar Sadykov and then developed during usual team meetings. Every team member was given a part of project to search and develop, which was presented be them during meetings and discussed by other team members
Luiza Niyazmetova as senior student was very kind to teach new members of team to do wetlab. And four members of team: Altynay Abdirakhmanova, Azhar Zhailauova, Aisha Yesbolatova and Askarbek Orakov stayed at the university for summer to do wetlab. It was a long and difficult summer full of fail and success where we gained a lot of experience of laboratory practice.
Wiki page was done by Askarbek Orakov and Batyrkhan Saduanov, who got interested in our project even being a robotics major student.
And we should mention that we really appreciated support by researchers from ""NURIS"" research center for providing with deficient materials and experience."

Who we are
Some of history
NU_KAZAKHSTAN team was created 3 years ago, in the winter of 2013, when five brave and deeply curious in synthetic biology students decided to work out own crazy project and participate in amazingly global competition - iGEM. Starting from that very memorable time our team is growing and getting more experience in dealing with different and interesting aspects of synthetic biology. Thanks to iGEM, the time of useful research experience transformed in the funny and precious moments of life: All of us are a big-big iGEM family!
Meet our team
Instructors
Olena Filchakova
I work as an Instructor in the Biology Department of Nazarbayev Uniersity. This year I supervise students who prepare for iGEM competition.I decided to help students because iGEM is a unique opportunity for them to be real scientists: to propose new idea, test it, analyze results and share findings with other students.The students learn a great deal while preparing to the competition and the experience they get will be useful in their future.

The best way ever to preserve lithic relics
an innovative biochemical method to resolve erosion.
View Our Works
The inscriptions on Precipice are one of the most common and fundamental forms of traditional Chinese relics. Due to having been carved in open areas plus the exposure to sunshine and raindrops, which is often the case for most of them,the Inscriptions are weathered readily. Currently, there are quite a few methods to resolve this phenomenon but some of them are not used properly which occasionally cause the damage for the Inscriptions. Our research project aims at using microorganism method, which is to put a plasmid with the ability to convert bio-oriented oxaloacetic acid to oxalate acid into the cell of E.coil, inducing the cell and the product will react with one component of the Inscriptions-- calcium carbonate-- to generate nearly insoluble calcium oxalate monohydrate to adhere to the Inscriptions for protection. Another E.coil with the ablility to secrete lipase has also been constructed; we aim to add this cell when we are cleansing the Inscriptions to resolve the oil substances on the surface of them. By constructing these products, we are able to protect the relics either from human errors as cleaning and protecting or from natural damnification.

Project's background
       The area near Qiantang River has a profound history of wealth. Hangzhou, in the heart of this area, situated many astonishing lithic cultural relics. Most of them were made during The Ten Kingdoms (A.D. 891-A.D. 979) and Song Dynasty (A.D. 960- A.D. 1279). Not only do those lithic relics represent the cutting edge of stone carving technology in contemporary time, but also they provide historians and archaeologists with solid historical evidence.
        There are three main types of lithic relics in Hangzhou; they are stone sculptures, stone towers also known as Dhavaja, and stone inscriptions. The stone sculptures are primarily represented by Feilai Peak (飞来峰), Ciyun Ridge (慈云岭), and Statue of Mahakala in Baocheng Temple (宝成寺麻曷葛剌). Stone Towers are primarily represented by White Tower (白塔). Stone inscriptions are primarily represented by Hetingwuhe Fubei on Lonely Mountain (孤山放鹤亭舞鹤赋碑).
        Plus, Feilai Peak and White Tower are National Key Historical Relics.      Most lithic relics encounter physical, chemical and biological interaction, resulting in weathering corrosion, pulverisation lesion, cracking, contamination, and colour mottling. Those phenomena jeopardise the value of lithic relics and even lithic relics themselves, and the lithic relics in Hangzhou are not of exceptions.
        In 2002, some of the classic lithic relics were inspected and it was found that the surface of Feilai Peak Sculpture was greatly ruined (Figure 1), and there is leaking on Ciyun Ridge Sculpture (Figure 2)..
    Meanwhile, Cultural Relics Department of China has been trying to maintain and recover the lithic relics. Since 2002, Cultural Relics Department of China mainly has been removing surface deposit, depleting pounding, strengthening crag, and changing flora; the government washed Feilai Peak Sculpture for many times (Figure 3).Government built a top above the Ciyun Peak Sculpture, this relic no longer had to expose to sun and rain henceforward (Figure 4).
    White Tower was comprehensively cleaned and strengthened by silicone by Zhejiang University of Technology (Figure 5).
     The power plants and railways were removed. During the washing, the staff intentionally left part of this tower intact, and made an contrast for further research of anti-contamination and anti-weathering (Figure 5-3, 5-4)
    However, 2015 field research shows most external lithic murals, statue, and towers still suffer from damage. Some even have distraction in main stone body. Meanwhile, there grows moss. Indoor stone inscriptions though are visible; there are obvious and irremovable cracks.
     Today, most preservation of lithic relics employ physical, chemical, or engineer approaches no matter where. It has been proven by reality that each of those approaches has fatal disadvantages for long-standing preservation of lithic relics, and those disadvantages would even lead to the ruin of lithic relics.
    Since forever, there are two categories of methods to preserve-- organic and inorganic. Organic materials cannot reach the standard of time to preserve relics such as epoxy resin, acrylic resin, silicone, etc.; inorganic materials would form hard shell that is not compatible or even react with the lithic relics, such as lime, barium hydroxide, and sulphuric acid.
     In conclusion, finding a long-standing, inexpensive, and efficient method to preserve lithic relics is an impending issue.

Principles of experiments
    The documents cited shows that even after natural weathering, biological decomposition, and acid rain erosion for a time period of time, some stone inscriptions, which are on rock surface containing calcium, remain in good condition because there is a thin layer of naturally formed semitransparent mineralised film that is hydrophilic and compact on such rock surface.
     In some part under the fine film, knife scratches on the stone from over a thousand years ago are still visible indistinctly. According to solid analysis, natural mineralised film is primarily composed of calcium oxalate monohydrate [Ca(COO)2·H2O] whose process of composition is interfered by microorganism.
     There are some advantages of calcium oxalate being a film as follows,
        1) In water, especially in acidulous water, the solubility of calcium oxalate is one order of magnitude smaller than normal calcium carbonate.
        2) Organically oriented calcium oxalate crystal's particles are fine and compact, which prevent the infiltration of toxic and harmful materials.
        3) The system can't be easily broken by external forces in that there is no distinct boundary between calcium carbonate rock and calcium oxalate film.
        So, this research project has chosen E. coli that has been transcribed with lipase to clean some stone relics that are covered with oil; then, we use E. coli, with transcription, that can secrete oxalate acid upon the stone relics. Therefore, there forms calcium oxalate to be protection film in order to preserve lithic relics.
        If we use chemical methods to generate calcium oxalate, we have to immerse the lithic relics in the chemical liquid; however, it is not suitable for the preservation of large-scale outdoor lithic relics. In fact, the natural existing calcium oxalate comes from the reaction of oxalate acid generated by microorganism and calcium compound on the surface of stone. This research project will utilise genetic engineering methods to ""graft"" the gene that generates calcium oxalate into Escherichia coli (E. coil).
    Then oxalate acid reacts with calcium lithic relics to generate calcium oxalate, which stimulates its natural formation process. Finally, there forms a fine layer to protect the lithic relics.

Procedures in detail
1.2 Procedures of Experiments
     1.2.1 PCR Proliferation
        Due to high content of G-C base-pairs in target gene segments, GC Buffer is required in PCR proliferation. Refer to Takara's protocols to prepare 200μL of system: 100μL of GC Buffer, 16μL of dntp mixture, 4μL of sense primer, 4μL of anti-sense primer, 4μL of DNA templet, 2μL of Taq, and 70μL of H2O. 60°C-70°C is used for Gradient PCR, the sixth bad is the brightest (Figure 9) thus the temperature of such is best for annealing. In new system, PCR is proceeded in that temperature; finally we get the gene segments with gene linkers.
    1.2.2 Gel electrophoresis, purification
    1.2.3 Digestion
        Put NotI and NdeI restriction endonuclease in gene segment and vector pET-28a respectively.

Results of Experiments and Analysis
1.3 Results of Experiments and Analysis
     1.3.1 Digestion check
        (1) Use NcoI and XhoI to digest plasmid on lipase after PCR. We know our result is correct because two bright parts of plasmid is in the same position and of the same size.
        (2) Use NdeI and NotI to digest plasmid on OAH after PCR. We know our result is correct because two bright parts of plasmid is in the same position and of the same size. (Figure 10)
    1.3.2 Sequencing
        The results of t sequencing of Lipase and OAH are both correct, for more detail, check appendix 1.
    1.3.3 Functional Test of Lipase
        Let PET-28a-Lipase plasmid be transcribed into BL-21 E. coli (the procedure is the same as that of TOP-10 E. coli), then put on substrate media. Pick E. coli into shake flask for 3 hours. Join IPTG solution (0.1 mmol/L) for abduction for 6 hours. Put into centrifugal machine then supernatant liquid (with lipase) for lipase test. The result shows that the colour has changed besides plasmid with lipase (Figure 11), showing that LipB2 gene is correctly expressed in BL21 E. coli.
         Linking and setting the groups Experimental group:plasmid after digestion + target gene + T4 DNA Ligase + buffer Control group: plasmid after digestion *Experiment conducted under 16°C
1.4 Result Analysis and Prospect
    According to the results of sequencing, actual sequence is identical to designed sequence, which testifies the validity of formulation (appendix 1). In lipase functional test, there is relatively obvious phenomenon under IPTG abduction (Figure 11), which testifies the function of gene.
    Hence, using this reformed lipase can erase the grease cover on relic surface, and we hope to use OAH reconstruct relic surface.
    Meanwhile, recombinant lipase can be widely used in any field for de-greasing, for example, the de-greasing process of steel surface, pre-treatment of high-fat food disposal, etc.
    This research project only recombines the lipase without optimising it according to temperature fluctuation, abduction concentration. We hope our project is helpful in every field.

Mathimatical models
    Since there is no one had done the same experiment as ours before, we assumed the growing pattern is similar as E.coil CVCC249.
    We got the data of this kind of E.coil from a doctoral dissertation,Comparison of Growth Kinetics and Physiological Characteristics of E.coil CVCC249 under both Batch and Continuous Culture by Huaiqiang Zhang, at page34. We used the logistic function data in this form, which is K=1.937 and r=0.550, and we assumed that N0=0.1( since N0 is initial population of E.coil, we can just simply set this data).
    According to logistic function , we can get the bacteria population-time function:(see Figure 1)
        f(t) = 1.937/(1+(1.937-0.1)e^(-0.55t)/0.1)         f(t) = 1.937/(1+18.37*e^(-0.55t))
    After that, we assumed that there will be x% of bacteria can present the property we need. Then we can get population of expressed bacteria:
        fex(t) = x%*1.937/(1+18.37*e^(-0.55t))
    Because we need the oxalic acid-time function, we assume the speed of oxalic acid secretion of per unit of bacteria is v. So the total speed should be:
        V(t) = v*x%*1.937/(1+18.37*e^(-0.55t))
    Since the secretion of oxalic acid should be accumulated, we take the integration of total speed of time. We used WolframAlpha program to find out this integration.
        ∫1.937/(1+18.37*e^(-0.55t)) dt=3.522*log(18.37+e^(0.55t))+C0
        ∫V(t) dt=v*x%*3.522*log(18.37+e^(0.55t))+C
    Because the function should began at (0,0) point, we can find out constant C in function.
        0=v*x%*3.522*log(18.37+e^(0.55*0))+C         C=-3.522*log(19.37)*v*x%         C=-10.438*v*x%         Substitute C=-10.438*v*x%
        Soa(t)=v*x%*(3.522*log(18.37+e^(0.55t))-10.438)
    This is oxalic acid-time function.
    We also need to find out lipid-time function. Obviously, it’s more complicated than last function, since the decomposition speed cannot be a constant.
    The fex(t) function should be also available in this part. Starting constructing process, we assumed that initial total lipid is N, lipid that decomposed is n, and the decomposing speed is relate to following factors:
    k: a constant representing efficiency of lipase     (N-n): remain amount of lipid     fex(t): quantity of expressed bacteria
    And there should be a function meaning that decomposing speed is proportional to the remain amount of lipid and quantity of expressed bacteria:
        dn/dt=k*(N-n)*fex(t)
        Solve that differential equation.
        1/(N-n) dn=k*fex (t) dt         ∫1/(N-n) dn=k∫fex (t) dt         -ln(N-n)=k∫f ex(t) dt + C
    Since we already know that ∫f ex(t) dt= x%*(3.522*log(18.37+e^(0.55t))-10.438) in this condition.
        -ln(N-n)=k*x%*(3.522*log(18.37+e^(0.55t))-10.438)         (N-n)=e^(-k*x%*(3.522*log(18.37+e^(0.55t))-10.438))
    So the lipid-time function, Slp(t), were found:
        Slp(t)=(N-n)=e^(-k*x%*(3.522*log(18.37+e^(0.55t))-10.438))

Collaborations
Our team collaborated with various IGEM teams and other people in this project
                                                                                                                                                                 We collaborated with the collegiate team— Zhejiang University.
                                                                                                                                                                The students of ZJU helped us in the pre-programm training in the site of Zhejiang Association for Science and Technology.
                                                                                                                                                                They taught us the basic biology experimental techniques by dyeing colon bacillus in a bio-tech way.
                                                                                                                                                                Meanwhile, they invited the team instructor of Peking University to introduce us how to understand this competition.
                                                                                                                                                                Interview with the local experts
                                                                                                                                                                Since our research projects are interdisciplinary as well as socially-based,
                                                                                                                                                                 we consulted our ideas with professor in the field about the production of our experiment applying the other fields beyond the cultural artifacts protection.
                                                                                                                                                                We then communicate with Prof. Zhang, Zhejiang University, whose field is civil-engineering.
                                                                                                                                                                        Q1: How can the greasing removal apply in civil engineering?
                                                                                                                                                                        Q2: In the field of civil engineering, are there any other applications?
                                                                                                                                                                        Q3: How efficient is this method or else than biological method?
                                                                                                                                                                Based on these three question, Professor gave the following answer to all of these.
                                                                                                                                                                Reinforced concrete structure has been widely used in construction engineering, and the corrosion of concrete will cause irreversible damage of the structure,
                                                                                                                                                                especially in the moist environment, or in the coastal areas; for example the basement engineering, coastal areas of reinforced concrete Bridges.
                                                                                                                                                                In the dampness and water environment, corrosion speeds faster. At present engineers mainly adopt anticorrosion coating materials, including organic coating, inorganic coating and coating,
                                                                                                                                                                 the widely application of polyurethane waterproof coating, polymer cement waterproof coating, cement based waterproof coating and organic silicon waterproof coating, etc.
                                                                                                                                                                However, there is rare application of biological coating in practical. According to the principle, it has certain feasibility,
                                                                                                                                                                because the principle of chemical coating is the main component of waterproof material, such as sodium silicate, can quickly and effectively concrete structure layer of calcium hydroxide, aluminium, calcium, calcium silicate,
                                                                                                                                                                to form the wool stoma of inert crystals embedded in concrete,
                                                                                                                                                                 to airtight micro cracks, thereby increasing the compactness of concrete surface layer and the compressive strength. In the study of the biological mechanism of action of anticorrosion materials and similar is feasible in theory,
                                                                                                                                                                but in the specific application, also need to further study of the role of timeliness, economy.

     1.Training for iGEM
The iGEM program requires the interdisciplinary abilities. To approach this purpose, we designed a series of trainings including computer programming, biological experiment skills, etc. (The following photographs illustrates the process) The collegiate team from Zhejiang University provides an opportunity which shows us how the biological experiments run.
     2. Pre-research of project
We distributed questionnaires and conducted survey in order to learn about the current knowledge of local peoples towards cultural artifacts in Hangzhou. The following diagrams are analyzed by the data. According to the data, the current situation of protection and renovating towards cultural artifacts and synthetic biology does not have bright prospects. The lack of attentions in civilians can cause the enormous negative effects on research and the practical usage, so we organized a series of activities to publicize the cultural artifacts in Hangzhou, the synthetic biology.(more details in Publicity)

The best way ever to preserve lithic relics
an innovative biochemical method to resolve erosion.
View Our Works
The inscriptions on Precipice are one of the most common and fundamental forms of traditional Chinese relics. Due to having been carved in open areas plus the exposure to sunshine and raindrops, which is often the case for most of them,the Inscriptions are weathered readily. Currently, there are quite a few methods to resolve this phenomenon but some of them are not used properly which occasionally cause the damage for the Inscriptions. Our research project aims at using microorganism method, which is to put a plasmid with the ability to convert bio-oriented oxaloacetic acid to oxalate acid into the cell of E.coil, inducing the cell and the product will react with one component of the Inscriptions-- calcium carbonate-- to generate nearly insoluble calcium oxalate monohydrate to adhere to the Inscriptions for protection. Another E.coil with the ablility to secrete lipase has also been constructed; we aim to add this cell when we are cleansing the Inscriptions to resolve the oil substances on the surface of them. By constructing these products, we are able to protect the relics either from human errors as cleaning and protecting or from natural damnification.

Project's background
       The area near Qiantang River has a profound history of wealth. Hangzhou, in the heart of this area, situated many astonishing lithic cultural relics. Most of them were made during The Ten Kingdoms (A.D. 891-A.D. 979) and Song Dynasty (A.D. 960- A.D. 1279). Not only do those lithic relics represent the cutting edge of stone carving technology in contemporary time, but also they provide historians and archaeologists with solid historical evidence.
        There are three main types of lithic relics in Hangzhou; they are stone sculptures, stone towers also known as Dhavaja, and stone inscriptions. The stone sculptures are primarily represented by Feilai Peak (飞来峰), Ciyun Ridge (慈云岭), and Statue of Mahakala in Baocheng Temple (宝成寺麻曷葛剌). Stone Towers are primarily represented by White Tower (白塔). Stone inscriptions are primarily represented by Hetingwuhe Fubei on Lonely Mountain (孤山放鹤亭舞鹤赋碑).
        Plus, Feilai Peak and White Tower are National Key Historical Relics.      Most lithic relics encounter physical, chemical and biological interaction, resulting in weathering corrosion, pulverisation lesion, cracking, contamination, and colour mottling. Those phenomena jeopardise the value of lithic relics and even lithic relics themselves, and the lithic relics in Hangzhou are not of exceptions.
        In 2002, some of the classic lithic relics were inspected and it was found that the surface of Feilai Peak Sculpture was greatly ruined (Figure 1), and there is leaking on Ciyun Ridge Sculpture (Figure 2)..
    Meanwhile, Cultural Relics Department of China has been trying to maintain and recover the lithic relics. Since 2002, Cultural Relics Department of China mainly has been removing surface deposit, depleting pounding, strengthening crag, and changing flora; the government washed Feilai Peak Sculpture for many times (Figure 3).Government built a top above the Ciyun Peak Sculpture, this relic no longer had to expose to sun and rain henceforward (Figure 4).
    White Tower was comprehensively cleaned and strengthened by silicone by Zhejiang University of Technology (Figure 5).
     The power plants and railways were removed. During the washing, the staff intentionally left part of this tower intact, and made an contrast for further research of anti-contamination and anti-weathering (Figure 5-3, 5-4)
    However, 2015 field research shows most external lithic murals, statue, and towers still suffer from damage. Some even have distraction in main stone body. Meanwhile, there grows moss. Indoor stone inscriptions though are visible; there are obvious and irremovable cracks.
     Today, most preservation of lithic relics employ physical, chemical, or engineer approaches no matter where. It has been proven by reality that each of those approaches has fatal disadvantages for long-standing preservation of lithic relics, and those disadvantages would even lead to the ruin of lithic relics.
    Since forever, there are two categories of methods to preserve-- organic and inorganic. Organic materials cannot reach the standard of time to preserve relics such as epoxy resin, acrylic resin, silicone, etc.; inorganic materials would form hard shell that is not compatible or even react with the lithic relics, such as lime, barium hydroxide, and sulphuric acid.
     In conclusion, finding a long-standing, inexpensive, and efficient method to preserve lithic relics is an impending issue.

Principles of experiments
    The documents cited shows that even after natural weathering, biological decomposition, and acid rain erosion for a time period of time, some stone inscriptions, which are on rock surface containing calcium, remain in good condition because there is a thin layer of naturally formed semitransparent mineralised film that is hydrophilic and compact on such rock surface.
     In some part under the fine film, knife scratches on the stone from over a thousand years ago are still visible indistinctly. According to solid analysis, natural mineralised film is primarily composed of calcium oxalate monohydrate [Ca(COO)2·H2O] whose process of composition is interfered by microorganism.
     There are some advantages of calcium oxalate being a film as follows,
        1) In water, especially in acidulous water, the solubility of calcium oxalate is one order of magnitude smaller than normal calcium carbonate.
        2) Organically oriented calcium oxalate crystal's particles are fine and compact, which prevent the infiltration of toxic and harmful materials.
        3) The system can't be easily broken by external forces in that there is no distinct boundary between calcium carbonate rock and calcium oxalate film.
        So, this research project has chosen E. coli that has been transcribed with lipase to clean some stone relics that are covered with oil; then, we use E. coli, with transcription, that can secrete oxalate acid upon the stone relics. Therefore, there forms calcium oxalate to be protection film in order to preserve lithic relics.
        If we use chemical methods to generate calcium oxalate, we have to immerse the lithic relics in the chemical liquid; however, it is not suitable for the preservation of large-scale outdoor lithic relics. In fact, the natural existing calcium oxalate comes from the reaction of oxalate acid generated by microorganism and calcium compound on the surface of stone. This research project will utilise genetic engineering methods to ""graft"" the gene that generates calcium oxalate into Escherichia coli (E. coil).
    Then oxalate acid reacts with calcium lithic relics to generate calcium oxalate, which stimulates its natural formation process. Finally, there forms a fine layer to protect the lithic relics.

Procedures in detail
1.2 Procedures of Experiments
     1.2.1 PCR Proliferation
        Due to high content of G-C base-pairs in target gene segments, GC Buffer is required in PCR proliferation. Refer to Takara's protocols to prepare 200μL of system: 100μL of GC Buffer, 16μL of dntp mixture, 4μL of sense primer, 4μL of anti-sense primer, 4μL of DNA templet, 2μL of Taq, and 70μL of H2O. 60°C-70°C is used for Gradient PCR, the sixth bad is the brightest (Figure 9) thus the temperature of such is best for annealing. In new system, PCR is proceeded in that temperature; finally we get the gene segments with gene linkers.

Results of Experiments and Analysis
1.3 Results of Experiments and Analysis
     1.3.1 Digestion check
        (1) Use NcoI and XhoI to digest plasmid on lipase after PCR. We know our result is correct because two bright parts of plasmid is in the same position and of the same size.
        (2) Use NdeI and NotI to digest plasmid on OAH after PCR. We know our result is correct because two bright parts of plasmid is in the same position and of the same size. (Figure 10)
    1.3.2 Sequencing
        The results of t sequencing of Lipase and OAH are both correct, for more detail, check appendix 1.
    1.3.3 Functional Test of Lipase
        Let PET-28a-Lipase plasmid be transcribed into BL-21 E. coli (the procedure is the same as that of TOP-10 E. coli), then put on substrate media. Pick E. coli into shake flask for 3 hours. Join IPTG solution (0.1 mmol/L) for abduction for 6 hours. Put into centrifugal machine then supernatant liquid (with lipase) for lipase test. The result shows that the colour has changed besides plasmid with lipase (Figure 11), showing that LipB2 gene is correctly expressed in BL21 E. coli.
         Linking and setting the groups Experimental group:plasmid after digestion + target gene + T4 DNA Ligase + buffer Control group: plasmid after digestion *Experiment conducted under 16°C
1.4 Result Analysis and Prospect
    According to the results of sequencing, actual sequence is identical to designed sequence, which testifies the validity of formulation (appendix 1). In lipase functional test, there is relatively obvious phenomenon under IPTG abduction (Figure 11), which testifies the function of gene.
    Hence, using this reformed lipase can erase the grease cover on relic surface, and we hope to use OAH reconstruct relic surface.
    Meanwhile, recombinant lipase can be widely used in any field for de-greasing, for example, the de-greasing process of steel surface, pre-treatment of high-fat food disposal, etc.
    This research project only recombines the lipase without optimising it according to temperature fluctuation, abduction concentration. We hope our project is helpful in every field.

Mathimatical models
    Since there is no one had done the same experiment as ours before, we assumed the growing pattern is similar as E.coil CVCC249.
    We got the data of this kind of E.coil from a doctoral dissertation,Comparison of Growth Kinetics and Physiological Characteristics of E.coil CVCC249 under both Batch and Continuous Culture by Huaiqiang Zhang, at page34. We used the logistic function data in this form, which is K=1.937 and r=0.550, and we assumed that N0=0.1( since N0 is initial population of E.coil, we can just simply set this data).
    According to logistic function , we can get the bacteria population-time function:(see Figure 1)
        f(t) = 1.937/(1+(1.937-0.1)e^(-0.55t)/0.1)         f(t) = 1.937/(1+18.37*e^(-0.55t))
    After that, we assumed that there will be x% of bacteria can present the property we need. Then we can get population of expressed bacteria:
        fex(t) = x%*1.937/(1+18.37*e^(-0.55t))
    Because we need the oxalic acid-time function, we assume the speed of oxalic acid secretion of per unit of bacteria is v. So the total speed should be:
        V(t) = v*x%*1.937/(1+18.37*e^(-0.55t))
    Since the secretion of oxalic acid should be accumulated, we take the integration of total speed of time. We used WolframAlpha program to find out this integration.
        ∫1.937/(1+18.37*e^(-0.55t)) dt=3.522*log(18.37+e^(0.55t))+C0
        ∫V(t) dt=v*x%*3.522*log(18.37+e^(0.55t))+C
    Because the function should began at (0,0) point, we can find out constant C in function.
        0=v*x%*3.522*log(18.37+e^(0.55*0))+C         C=-3.522*log(19.37)*v*x%         C=-10.438*v*x%         Substitute C=-10.438*v*x%
        Soa(t)=v*x%*(3.522*log(18.37+e^(0.55t))-10.438)
    This is oxalic acid-time function.
    We also need to find out lipid-time function. Obviously, it’s more complicated than last function, since the decomposition speed cannot be a constant.
    The fex(t) function should be also available in this part. Starting constructing process, we assumed that initial total lipid is N, lipid that decomposed is n, and the decomposing speed is relate to following factors:
    k: a constant representing efficiency of lipase     (N-n): remain amount of lipid     fex(t): quantity of expressed bacteria
    And there should be a function meaning that decomposing speed is proportional to the remain amount of lipid and quantity of expressed bacteria:
        dn/dt=k*(N-n)*fex(t)
        Solve that differential equation.
        1/(N-n) dn=k*fex (t) dt         ∫1/(N-n) dn=k∫fex (t) dt         -ln(N-n)=k∫f ex(t) dt + C
    Since we already know that ∫f ex(t) dt= x%*(3.522*log(18.37+e^(0.55t))-10.438) in this condition.
        -ln(N-n)=k*x%*(3.522*log(18.37+e^(0.55t))-10.438)         (N-n)=e^(-k*x%*(3.522*log(18.37+e^(0.55t))-10.438))
    So the lipid-time function, Slp(t), were found:
        Slp(t)=(N-n)=e^(-k*x%*(3.522*log(18.37+e^(0.55t))-10.438))

Collaborations
Our team collaborated with various IGEM teams and other people in this project
                                                                                                                                                                 We collaborated with the collegiate team— Zhejiang University.
                                                                                                                                                                The students of ZJU helped us in the pre-programm training in the site of Zhejiang Association for Science and Technology.
                                                                                                                                                                They taught us the basic biology experimental techniques by dyeing colon bacillus in a bio-tech way.
                                                                                                                                                                Meanwhile, they invited the team instructor of Peking University to introduce us how to understand this competition.
                                                                                                                                                                Interview with the local experts
                                                                                                                                                                Since our research projects are interdisciplinary as well as socially-based,
                                                                                                                                                                 we consulted our ideas with professor in the field about the production of our experiment applying the other fields beyond the cultural artifacts protection.
                                                                                                                                                                We then communicate with Prof. Zhang, Zhejiang University, whose field is civil-engineering.
                                                                                                                                                                        Q1: How can the greasing removal apply in civil engineering?
                                                                                                                                                                        Q2: In the field of civil engineering, are there any other applications?
                                                                                                                                                                        Q3: How efficient is this method or else than biological method?
                                                                                                                                                                Based on these three question, Professor gave the following answer to all of these.
                                                                                                                                                                Reinforced concrete structure has been widely used in construction engineering, and the corrosion of concrete will cause irreversible damage of the structure,
                                                                                                                                                                especially in the moist environment, or in the coastal areas; for example the basement engineering, coastal areas of reinforced concrete Bridges.
                                                                                                                                                                In the dampness and water environment, corrosion speeds faster. At present engineers mainly adopt anticorrosion coating materials, including organic coating, inorganic coating and coating,
                                                                                                                                                                 the widely application of polyurethane waterproof coating, polymer cement waterproof coating, cement based waterproof coating and organic silicon waterproof coating, etc.
                                                                                                                                                                However, there is rare application of biological coating in practical. According to the principle, it has certain feasibility,
                                                                                                                                                                because the principle of chemical coating is the main component of waterproof material, such as sodium silicate, can quickly and effectively concrete structure layer of calcium hydroxide, aluminium, calcium, calcium silicate,
                                                                                                                                                                to form the wool stoma of inert crystals embedded in concrete,
                                                                                                                                                                 to airtight micro cracks, thereby increasing the compactness of concrete surface layer and the compressive strength. In the study of the biological mechanism of action of anticorrosion materials and similar is feasible in theory,
                                                                                                                                                                but in the specific application, also need to further study of the role of timeliness, economy.

Acknowledgements
All the work, including experiments, team wiki construction, modeling, and human practice, were done by the students in our team. Instructors and our advisors helped us with brainstorming, checking and confirming part sequences and function, offering suggestions on modeling methods, providing support in policy and practices and public outreach, and so on. Yet we would also like to express special thanks to those who offered us assistance along the way: The background image of wiki was provided by a friend of one of our team members. The sponsors and other institutions that have helped us are listed on the footer of our wiki page. General support
Dr. Chuan-Hsiung Chang, Dr. Ching-Fen Chang and Mr. Jude Clapper are the mentors of our team. They guided us along the way throughout preparation, lecture learning and brainstorming and always encouraged us to think out of the box and to view things from different perspectives.
Dr. Ching-Fen Chang is in charge of wet lab training for iGEM experiments, and she always has immense patience to help us and teach us. Even though we might cause her trouble sometimes, she is still willing to give us good advice and let us try out various experiments in the lab. During those experimental times, we are really grateful to her for all her great help and care.
Dr. You-Yin Chen helped us construct the wireless sensor and gave us important advice about our functional prototype, the soil based microbial fuel cell
Jesse Wu taught us a lot, such as biobricking, creating Media wiki, paper research, etc during lecture. He is a really nice person, and has patience to help us solve different problems with machine and computer software. The knowledge he taught us is very useful. He is our great teacher and is always willing to answer our questions. With his help, our project is made much more special!
Chih-Hsien Yang also taught us modeling, and guide us to use Octave to present our experimental results. We are also very grateful to him!"

Team Profile
Hello! We, the iGEM team of IIT Kharagpur, are a team of                   enthusiastic biotechnologists in training. A mixed group of students of all                   ages, we strive towards the common goal of competing with the most                   brilliant young minds in the field while evolving our own knowledge and                   helping out make the world a slightly better place in the process. All of us belong to the same discipline of biotechnology with diverse                   specializations, and we are from the Indian Institute of Technology                   Kharagpur, located in West Bengal, India. Though we share a common                   interest and discipline, the group itself is quite diverse and the contribution                   of each person is needed to make things happen. Our group is dedicated                   and we don't mind burning the midnight oil or sidelining our vacations if                   that's what it takes. We have been fortunate in our guides who have been patient                   and extremely supporting. We may have started out late, but                   we have high expectations from our team both with regard to                   the competition and ourselves. It's a learning experience why                   we won't have fun all the same!

ATTRIBUTIONS
Project Design and Wet Lab Work: The frontrunners of the wet lab work were Roshan, Sriram, Harsheel and Yogesh. Each step was discussed before and reviewed after it was done, within themselves and with our guide Prof. Agneyo Ganguly. Our research scholars Ms Swagata and Ms Shikha deserve special thanks for showing us the road and driving on track every time we lost our way.
Community: The workshop presentation at the Institute of Genetic Engineering (IGE), Kolkata was delivered by three student members of our team - Adarsh, Chetan and Pruthv. We would like to thank Professor Amit Chakravarty (Director, IGE) and Professor Sudipa Chakravarty (HOD, Microbiology Department, IGE) for this opportunity to conduct a workshop at institute.
Two of our student team members - Adarsh and Dipasha, also visited West Medinipur, Kolkata to teach the students about food spoilage and its reasons. The students were, in a very simple and lucid way, explained about the concepts of Synthetic Biology and its applications.
Guide Book: The content of our “Guide Book on Food Spoilage” was primarily curated and organized by Jugal and Karan, two of our student team members. The final formatting, layout designing and structuring was done by Roshan, Varshit and Harsheel. We learnt a lot in the process of making this booklet and hope it benefits as many people as possible.
Surveys: We launched two surveys – One essentially revolving around the theme of “Food Spoilage”, and the other targeting the experienced iGEM teams around the world, so as to gather useful and critical information to “Guide the Beginner” iGEM teams. We would like to thank all the people and iGEM teams across the world who participated in our surveys and helped us gather the data we needed  for our analysis.
Wiki Creation: The style, theme and development of our iGEM wiki were responsibly handled by two of our student team members – Satyam (Web-Wizard) and Sanjay (Designing-Maestro)
Wiki Content Development: Every student member of the team chipped in for this. The content of the pages was developed by the third year undergraduate student members of the team (special mention: Jugal, Dipasha, Adarsh and Rhushikesh) was supervised and guided by the fourth year members Varshit, Roshan and Harsheel. The video-making and editing was done by Harsheel, Rhushikesh, Sanjay and Shaurya.
Project Modeling: We would like to thank Professor Ritwik Kumar Layek of the Department of Electronics Electrical Communication Engineering, IIT Kharagpur for his help in explaining to us a bacterial system’s pathway modelling. We got to know about some platforms from where we can build our concepts on system engineering and mathematical modelling. The initial mathematical models were prepared by Adarsh and Rhushikesh.
Guidance: We also would like to thank Professor Agneyo Ganguly (our Project Instructor), Professor Ritwik Kumar Layek and Professor Hari Niwas Mishra (Professor, Agricultural and Food Engineering Department, IIT Kharagpur) for helping us get through our obstacles at each turn.
Professor H.N.Mishra helped us specifically with understanding more about the statistics of different types of grain spoilage in India, and gave a lot of useful suggestions for the potential “Food Contamination Detection” product kit that could result from the successful and complete implementation of our project idea.
For our two wonderful Meet-ups (over the summers), we would like to thank the iGEM teams IISER_Pune and NCTU_Formosa. The meetups definitely served as a great platform for us to practice and test our level of preparation before our actual presentation at the Giant Jamboree.
We also had a great time collaborating with the iGEM teams – iGEM UCSF Team, CU Boulder iGEM Team and the iGEM UI-Indonesia Team.
Additionally, we helped a lot of teams with the publicity of their surveys, such as the teams – iGEM Paris Bettencourt, iGEM NEFU_China,  iGEM Korea_U_Seoul, iGEM Team Nankai.
We have indeed have a great time interacting and collaborating with several iGEM teams across the world. This has been an experience that we will always cherish. And we look forward to meeting all the other iGEM teams in Boston next week!
Special Thanks: For capturing great pictures of our team, we would like to thank Nikesh Aryan (Undergraduate Student, Department of Biotechnology, IIT Kharagpur).

Team
We are the 2015 version of the Paris-Saclay team and we will proudly represent the Paris Saclay University at Boston for the fourth consecutive year. The first Team Paris Saclay was created in 2011 by both students and researchers found of synthetic Biology who had heard about a competition which was becoming more and more important on the other side of the Atlantic, the iGEM competition.
Our team is composed of students from different scientific fields forming a formidable multidisciplinary group. We are advised by two PhD  and four researchers from the Institute of Integrative Biology of the Cell (I2BC). This institute regroups 80 teams of scientists, 15 technological facilities from 8 research units. It hosts us and helps us every year for the realisation of our project and we thank all the members and managers of the institute for their very welcoming care.

Collaboration
This year, we have carried out several collabrations with other iGEM teams.
 
As a Health and Medicine team we have contacted the UCL iGEM team and had a quite interesting conversation about the difficulty and our experiences of presenting a Health and Medicine project, especially at safety and ethics section of the project. After asking questions about their aspects of safety&ethics, we mentioned our way to outgo these problems: With the creating of a platform, called as Virtual Hospital, where we can be more imaginary and feel like our projects can be applied to today's medical approaches. (Visit 'Human Practise' to learn more about the Virtual Hospital). The UCL iGEM team acceptet this suggestion and mentioned, that they want to join our virtual hospital.
 
Also we mentored the AUC Turkey iGEM High School team this year and guided them during their experiments to increase their possibility of achieving their set goals.
 
Additionally, we have carried out an iGEM Rhizi Collaboration with iGEM Paris Bettencourt, were our team is getting connected to other iGEM teams with same communalities and were we got a badge for participating in their iGEM Rhizi."

Interlab Study
We have made  The Measurement  Interlab Study which was requested from iGEM this year. We are really glad being in this study which the teams ,all of around the world , would take part . As it is summarized on the iGEM Measurement Study page, participating team like us , must fulfill these requirements which below.
1. Designing a wiki page about the contribution and the achievements of study.
2. Constructing the particular BioBricks defined clearly on the page. (The results are    shown below.)
3. Collecting fluorescence data from each of these parts. (The results are sent to iGEM    HQ and also shown below.)
4. Submitting these data through Interlab Study form
The devices that we use and built-up are here.
Existing Steps:BBa_I13504(B0034-E0040-B0010-B0012) in PSB1A2 backbone.
1.New device requisted from iGEM:  J23101 + I13504 (B0034-E0040-B0015), must be built in the pSB1C3 backbone
2. .New device requisted from iGEM: J23106 + I13504 (B0034-E0040-B0015), must be built in the pSB1C3 backbone
3.New device requisted from iGEM: J23117 + I13504 (B0034-E0040-B0015), must be built in the pSB1C3 backbone
Therefore we worked through the iGEM’s proposal and we watched these steps.
1) We took the BBa_J23101, BBa_J23106 , BBa_J23117 and also BBa_I13504 genes from Kit Plates .
2)For cloning process we chose E.Coli BL21 and prepared competent cells .
3)We ligated our promoters(BBa_J23101, BBa_j23106 and BBa_J23117) with our existing device(BBa_I13504) and we succeed it.
4)We transformed our parts [BBa_J23101+BBa_I13504, BBa_J23106+BBa_I13504 and BBa_J23117+BBa_I13504] into the competent cells and growth them in solid culture and liquid culture successively.
5)After the cloning part, we measured the protein which were produced by our bacterias , values in different emission and excitation values. At 510 nanometer emission and 483 nanometer excitation value,  the protein concentrations are measured as follows:
Protein Concentration Values
Unfortunately we have lost the graphs which shown protein levels, so we really upset about it. But we are grateful to Measurement HQ for their understanding."

Our Team
We are Team Chalmers-Gothenburg, a group of students with different backgrounds but a common interest in Synthetic biology. Chalmers University is a well-known technical university in Gothenburg, the second largest city in Sweden located on the beautiful but rainy west coast.
The team is composed of 15 students with backgrounds in several different fields, including Biotechnology, Chemistry, Physics and Computational Science. This broad range of knowledge has given us the possibility to face challenges with different perspectives. Therefore teamwork and cooperation are of great importance to our team and every person in the team is crucial for a successful result.
To integrate the different parts of the project and to avoid miscommunication, we have deliberately chosen not to divide into groups with specific tasks. Instead most of the team members have been involved in both lab work and human practices. However, the lab work has been divided into three main groups focusing on each of our three systems.
No matter how much we enjoy working in our lab, we have also arranged team building activities outside the lab almost every week which has made the summer even more fun."

Attributions
Each team must clearly attribute work done by the student team members on this page. The team must distinguish work done by the students from work done by others, including the host labs, advisors, instructors, and individuals not on the team roster.
Can we base our project on a previous one?
Yes! You can have a project based on a previous team, or based on someone else's idea, as long as you state this fact very clearly and give credit for the original project.
Why is this page needed?
The Attribution requirement helps the judges know what you did yourselves and what you had help with. We don't mind if you get help with difficult or complex techniques, but you must report what work your team did and what work was done by others.
For example, you might choose to work with an animal model during your project. Working with animals requires getting a license and applying far in advance to conduct certain experiments in many countries. This is difficult to achieve during the course of a summer, but much easier if you can work with a postdoc or PI who has the right licenses.

Project idea
Even though the whole team was involved in the development of the project idea, special thanks to Katharina Sporbeck and Nicolai von Kuegelgen of the team for developing our project idea with special efforts.
Lab work and summercamp
Without our lab team, Kevin Sabath, Katharina Sporbeck, Nicolai von Kuegelgen and Lisa Wellinger we would not have the results we have and also our summercamp would have not existed - from organizing the camp to instructing and showing the bachelor students how to work in a lab everything was done by them.
Fundraising
Nicolas Layer, Daniela Nguyen, Edwin Schmierer (GoCoTe e.V.) were responsible for fundraising, prepared and wrote e-mails to many companies as well as organizing ""Kleinkampftage"".
Wiki and homepage
Tim Kucera and Daniela Nguyen build wiki and homepage and fed them with contents.
Design and drawings
In times of waiting and boredom we had so much fun because of Cellfie and his colleagues. Without Katerina Romanova and Yvonne Thoma Cellfie and his Cellvengers would not exist as well as our wiki graphics.
Human Practices
Jens Reich organized our SynBio Day in the historic center of Tuebingen and with Sarah Roffeis the participation in a scientific speed dating in Freiburg. Also Sarah managed the programm during our summercamp and saw to it that we had a lot of fun. They both put much effort in inviting a school class to our lab and delivering them an insight into the world of synthetic biology. In addition they organized our School class@lab project day together with Vivien Weber and Philipp Mayer who communicated with the iGEM Team and the school class teacher.
Modeling
Adrian Geissler wrote and implemented all our modeling codes and helped with general data analysis.
Cooperation

Team Identity
We are SCUT Champion Park. Our team spirit is efficient and happy. In order to show the spirit and personality of our team, our designers have designed our own Team Identity.
Team Flag
The middle is our team logo. Our logo is a distortion of tetracycline, and combined with the first letter of our school name’s    abbreviation.
The color of home flag is the same blue as South China University of Technology's school badge, on behalf of passion and brave. The color of away flag is white which represents the exploring spirit of academic research.
Team Uniform
Our team uniform is a white long sleeve. The front logo combines the tetracycline and school English initials S, not only showing the scientific nature of biochemical research, but also highlighting the school name. The color, the same as our school’s badge, reflects the characteristics of calm. The back pattern is made of fluorescent material, passing out the modern sense.
Bookmark
The front of the bookmark is the abbreviation of South China University of Technology as a design element. These four letters combined with biological chemical elements. The color, including red, yellow and blue, is lively, generous and full of vitality. The team logo is on the opposite side making the bookmarks highly conspicuous.
Visual Identity
Our logo is derived from the molecular formula of tetracycline which is the main element of our experiment.Draw it out to a single regular hexagon as a creative element. The structure of this arrangement of hexagon is called a honeycomb structure. This structure reflects the feasibility and effectiveness of our research.

There are 15 student members, 5 instructors and 2 advisors in our team SCUT Champion Park. At first, we didn't think that our team would be so large, but with more and more talents join us, we are almost able to set up a company.
Our operating model is designed to deliver faster decisions. Each of us has clear duties and tasks. The 15 student members are divided into three big groups, and they are experimental group, social practice group, visual design group.
There are 6 members in the experimental group. Tao Deng is the group leader. The experimental group still divide into two smaller groups, core experimental group and biobrick group based on their experiments.
Social practice group has 3 students. Each member is a project manager for two to four projects. As the manager of these projects, they collect data, make plans and are primarily responsible for their own projects.
There are 5 members in the visual design group. Three are responsible for art and two are responsible for program design. Yuyu Tang is the leader of the visual design group. When other groups have accomplished some work, they summarize it and send it to Yuyu Tang. Then the designers will design these materials and the programmers will make them into web pages.
Jin Jia is the leader of SCUT Champion Park. He participates in all the parts of the total work and ensure them work well.

Major:  Physiology
I got to know the IGEM game from my classmate, Junjie Zhang, who has attended the IGEM game last year and  also been our Instructor this year. I think IGEM is a very interesting game, and I am also an active person, so I found a lot of like-minded friends to participate in the competition together. And I plan to apply for a PHD in the United States this fall for further study. I think this Boston trip will give me a real understanding of American College. I believe this game will be a precious memory for me.

I was very regret that there was no IGEM team of graduate in our university last year. But now I have joined the SCUT Champion Park team. When I know I can attend the competition, I am very excited. From my childhood, I see many competition of many subjects, but biology competition is very rare. IGEM is a competition of synthetic biology. The team needs to have the ability to control the input and output signal with technology of synthetic biology. In my mind, it is the best way to combine study with applying. How exciting it is to build the system for achieving the goal. In our team, I am a main experimenter, and I want to grow up with my team. I like challenge, and I think it will make life colorful. I believe in this competition, we will gain the friendship.team. I like challenge, I think it will make life rich and colorful. In the competition we can study together and gain the friendship.

It is my first time to participate in iGEM as a practitioner. My duty is working on Human Practices by communicating with cooperators and other iGEM teams, conducting investigations online, and organizing regular community-based scientific activities with my teammates. Social work may spend much time for graduated students, but it gives more opportunities to get out of laboratory to contact different people, listening to their needs. This will help us to design better productions to improve their life. I believe iGEM will be a fantastic experience for me to receive precious friendship and social responsibility.

background
We are from Israel, Kiryat Shmona, a small, quiet and beautiful town. Kiryat Shmona is the most northwestern town in Israel, and gets a lot of visitors and travelers due to the spectacular views. Kiryat Shmona is in the “Galilee region”. You can find nature, history, extreme activities, picnic sites and heritage, in short, a bit of everything in one beautiful region. 
Kiryat Shmona has one central comprehensive high school with 1350 students from seventh through twelfth grade. We are sophomore students studying Biotechnology as one of our major subjects. As part of this major, we learn and engage in synthetic biology. Last year we created a garment from the Kombucha fungus, and this year we are working diligently to produce the assessment to identify food allergens, which we are presenting here.
The biotechnology team includes 23 10th grade students. The students have been studying together since 7th grade until today. The school is characterized by a team of teachers who teach the students mostly on how to deal with challenges. The group of students intensifies their math and science studies exceptionally. We are all planning a science academic career. Alongside the studies, each member of the team is involved in volunteering for the community in their free time.

THE TEAM
Kieran Rustage
Biologist
Kieran is a biological scientist, and our resident grumpy old man. He’s had an affinity for biology ever since ingesting a bit too much dirt as a child (there was no obvious harm caused).
So far in his undergraduate career he’s dabbled in topics spanning a wide range of the biological sciences; including population ecology, microbiology and science communication.
In the future, Kieran hopes to apply this multi-disciplinary approach to carve out a career in public health; specifically in infectious disease epidemiology.
Farhan Mitha
Biologist
Farhan is a biological scientist currently midway through his undergraduate studies at the University of East Anglia. He has wide-ranging interests in biology, from evolutionary biology to molecular biology to science communication and intends to pursue a career in research science.
He was attracted to iGEM because the idea of exploring such a promising and exciting field as synthetic biology really appealed to him, as did the idea of designing a lab project from scratch and carrying it out. In his spare time he enjoys writing and performing stand-up comedy as often as he can.
Mark Elms
Biological and Medicinal Chemist
Mark is a biological and medicinal chemistry student at the University of East Anglia going into his third of four years. This undergraduate course consists of the chemistry that occurs within the body to enable life, the chemistry of diseases and illnesses, and the design and synthesis of medicinal drugs and the affect that these drugs have on the body. These include subjects such as cell biology, biochemistry, inorganic/organic chemistry and medicinal chemistry.
In his spare time he plays for the university football and futsal teams who have both enjoyed successful seasons. In the future, Mark is hoping to apply his scientific skills to pursue a career in drug research or chemical engineering for drug manufacture.
Flavia Valeo
Biomedic
Flavia is a second year biomedicine student at the University of East Anglia that discovered a passion for making agarose gels thanks to iGEM! (I know, sounds exciting). iGEM attracted her from the beginning due to its variety and aim to tackle real life problems.
She is interested in health and medicine and how new technologies such as synthetic biology can be used to approach new preventative, diagnostic and curative methods for diseases. During the summer she has been focused on creating this supersonic anti-cancer bacteria and also been involved with practice and polices.  You’ll see her smiling and laughing most of the time but don’t get scared, you’ll get used to it!
Outside the lab, travelling and photography are a must and in her free time she also plays the piano. In 5 years time she sees herself working in research and medicine alongside starting her own colourful agarose gel business!
Josh Thody
Computer Scientist
Josh is a computing science student at the University of East Anglia. He was particularly excited, and nervous, to be a part of iGEM as biology, more specifically synthetic biology, is a completely new field of study for him.
He has a fascination with data structures and algorithms, programming, and computer graphics. He is tailoring much of his third and final year towards bioinformatics.
In his spare time he plays hockey for the university 1st team and during last season he enjoyed being part of an undefeated team in both Saturday and BUCS leagues, which also lead to a double promotion.
His roles in the team involve modelling and the design and development of the wiki.
In the future he would be interested in doing a PhD in the algorithmic aspects of bioinformatics.
Leda Coelewij
Biomedic
Leda is a biomedicine student at the University of East Anglia. Science has interested her ever since she was a child and learning that a heart doesn’t actually look like what the cartoons suggest.
She has an international background, with Italian and Dutch parents, born in America, living in Singapore and China before moving to England (which can make even the most basic questions like “Where are you from?” difficult to answer).
In the future Leda hopes to travel around the world, as well as pursue a career in research of biomedical science.
Pilar Corredor
Predoctoral Bioinformatician
Pilar is a biotechnologist with a recent interest in bioinformatics. She first found out about iGEM when she was an undergraduate student at the UPV in Valencia but she did not have an opportunity to be a part of it until now.
Pilar is currently a predoctoral student in bioinformatics at The Sainsbury Laboratory (TSL) and she is going to start her PhD at The Genome Analysis Centre (TGAC) after the jamboree. Her research interests focus on plant-pathogen interactions and she wants to apply transcriptomics and genomics to gain new insights about plant immunity in wheat.
As an advisor, Pilar has been mainly responsible for the computational aspect of the project. She has provided the biological background to the glycogen branching/debranching model and she has helped Josh to use his computing science knowledge to address biological questions. She also facilitated the collaboration with the UPV Valencia iGEM team.
Eleftheria Trampari
PhD Student
Eleftheria is a 3rd year PhD student at the John Innes Centre.
Her research focuses on bacterial signalling pathways and more specifically on the characterisation of novel cyclic di-GMP targets. Eleftheria has two MSc degrees in the agricultural biotechnology, molecular ecology and microbiology fields, which helped her acquire extensive expertise in molecular biology, genetics and protein biochemistry. Her skills range from bacterial genetic manipulation to cutting-edge biochemical techniques.
Eleftheria trained us in common laboratory and microbiological techniques, cloning, PCR and protein expression. She also taught us how to effectively manage our time in the lab environment, plan our experiments efficiently and multitask to get the desirable outcome in a limited time.
Sibyl Batey
PhD Student
Sibyl is a 2nd year PhD student in the Biological Chemistry department at the John Innes Centre. She completed her natural sciences MSc at Durham University in 2012, specialising in chemistry and biology.
Her research interests lie at the interface of these two sciences, with a focus on using chemical tools to investigate biological phenomena. Her PhD project investigates carbohydrate metabolism in Mycobacterium tuberculosis and has involved a range of techniques, including organic and analytical chemistry, enzymology, molecular biology and protein crystallography.
In her role as advisor to the NRP-iGEM team, Sibyl has trained us in molecular biology techniques, such as cloning, PCR and gel electrophoresis, as well as planning our experimental work efficiently. She has also provided expertise on carbohydrate metabolism and helped us design and run experiments to test the function of our BioBricks. Aside from the lab work, she has been involved in other aspects of the project, such as sourcing funding and facilitating collaborations.
Nicola Patron
Head of Synthetic Biology
Nicola is a molecular and synthetic biologist interested in the natural and engineered transfer of genetic material between genomes of different species. As the leader of the Synthetic Biology group at The Sainsbury Laboratory (TSL) and an investigator in OpenPlant, Nicola designs and develops molecular tools to engineer plant genomes and produce novel functions in plant cells.
As a bioengineer, Nicola is interested in the societal impacts of synthetic biology and the complex intellectual property issues that surround genetic sequences, DNA and natural products. She is an advocate of open-source tools for biology and of women in STEMM. As a 2015, SynBioLEAP fellow Nicola is recognized as an emerging leader in synthetic biology.
Richard Bowater
Senior Lecturer
Richard is a senior lecturer in the School of Biological Sciences at The University of East Anglia with a particular interest in biochemistry and molecular biology.
His research group has characterised DNA repair processes from a variety of different organisms. This research feeds into understanding the molecular mechanisms that influence genome stability. Richard is on the editorial advisory panel of The Biochemical Journal and The Scientific World Journal.
Mark Banfield
Biological Chemistry Project Leader
Mark is a biological chemistry project leader at the John Innes Centre (JIC).
Mark studies structure/function relationships in effector proteins from pathogens of mammals and plants. Effector proteins are molecules secreted from pathogens that either localize outside of or are translocated into host cells where they act to promote pathogen colonization. He also studies the host side of plant immunity, through the use of biochemical, biophysical and structural studies.
In addition to making fundamental discoveries concerning mechanisms of pathogen virulence, many of Mark’s studies are aimed at engineering plants to better resist infection by pathogens, improving performance in agriculture with a reduced need for chemical interventions.

Attributions
Each team must clearly attribute work done by the student team members on this page. The team must distinguish work done by the students from work done by others, including the host labs, advisors, instructors, and individuals not on the team roster.
Can we base our project on a previous one?
Yes! You can have a project based on a previous team, or based on someone else's idea, as long as you state this fact very clearly and give credit for the original project.
Why is this page needed?
The Attribution requirement helps the judges know what you did yourselves and what you had help with. We don't mind if you get help with difficult or complex techniques, but you must report what work your team did and what work was done by others.
For example, you might choose to work with an animal model during your project. Working with animals requires getting a license and applying far in advance to conduct certain experiments in many countries. This is difficult to achieve during the course of a summer, but much easier if you can work with a postdoc or PI who has the right licenses.

Team Members
Sam Keating
I have been on the UMBC iGEM team for two years and was co-president for one year. I am a senior biochemical engineer and I plan on going to graduate school next year. I help with a lot of the planning inside and outside of the lab and make sure that we have adequate resources and plans for our project. I helped to train new members at the beginning of the year. I also looked a lot at the gene sequences of our genes of interest and updated our entries on the wiki and the registry pages.
Pranesh Navarathna
I am a senior Chemical Engineering major in the Bioengineering Track. I am Co-President of the 2015 UMBC iGEM team and have been involved in working with faculty and student government to obtain funding and support for our project. During the summer, I organized, planned and executed experiments along with team members. My lab experience includes working extensively with fungal fermentation and phenotypic profiling. I also have experience with industrial microbial platform development with E.coli. I intend to pursue graduate study in Bioengineering. I am especially proud with what we accomplished this summer and to be part of UMBC's first appearance at the Giant Jamboree!
Mukta Bain
I am a senior at UMBC. My major is general biology BA. After BA I want to get my master in public health. I have previously worked in the lab for classes. My contribution to the team was helping with the wet lab and working side by side with other team members.
May Li
I am a senior Biochemistry major and will be pursuing a medical degree after graduation. My previous research experience is in the realm of computational biochemistry research and organic chemistry research. I am grateful to experience the biological aspect of research through iGEM, and have been involved in running/designing experiments, as well as other organizational tasks. I love being in lab with other iGEM members over the summer and am very proud of the work we've done.
Natithorn Bhusri
I am a senior at UMBC and my major is Biochemistry. As secretary of iGEM, I planned meetings and wet lab dates for our project. I also aided in updating our notebook and attributions on the wiki pages. I helped conduct the optical density(growth) experiments and processed the data as graphs. I plan to attend graduate school next year and further my studies in Toxicology. I am really proud of how much we have done this summer and I am glad that I participated in it.
Joseph Sparenberg
Joseph Sparenberg took an odd path to get where he is today because he graduated high school in 1997, then stopped going to college after 3 semesters and took a 10 year hiatus working various jobs. Finally returning to school part time in 2008, he has continued part time to this day. He is now a senior double majoring in Biochemistry and Biology and will be graduating in May 2016. He plans on pursuing a PhD in Biochemistry with focusing on cancer research.  He started with the iGEM team May 2015 and has contributed by reading relevant literature, helping with the bioinformatics portion of the lab, helping with the late shifts of the day long OD experiments and helping wherever needed while also working full time.
William Larsen Angel, Jr.
I graduated with a biology degree from UMBC in 2014 and am beginning a master’s program in molecular biology in the fall.  I have been with the iGEM team since its beginning and have fulfilled many roles in the team.  I acted as the treasurer and helped raise the money to pay the competition expenses.  I also acted as a project designer and helped elucidate the more difficult biological aspects of the project.  I am happy I had the opportunity to participate with this team, and I hope that the team continues for years to come.
John ""Richard"" Jayman
I am a senior biology major with aspirations of medical school. My lab experience involves testing novel molecular therapies for prostate cancer on a mouse model. In the iGEM arena, I am working with the UMBC team to take copper measurements and to prepare overnights for our engineered bacteria.
Pari Majethia
My major is Biology B.S. and I am a senior at UMBC. I had a great experience working on the iGEM project and learning about the effects of copper on the E.coli cells. I helped conduct the experiments
Alex Kuznetsov
I am a senior biochemistry student at UMBC. Some relevant experiences that I have consist of undergraduate experimental biology, as well as biochemistry laboratory courses. During this summer I created recombinant plasmids, as well as preformed bacterial transformations, optical density readings, for a number of transformed cell lines with the UMBC iGEM team.
Mark Saint-John Kerr
My name is Mark and I'm a senior.I joined iGEM to see if it could help me improve my lab skill set. I've always had a thing for biology and I hope that our project can stand up to the competition this year. I like cooking, baking, and just working with my hands in general which is why the lab setting suits me just fine."

Dominique Maccalla
""I can do all things through Him who strengthens me."" -- Philippians 4:13
Dominique is from New Haven, Connecticut and is a rising senior studying biomedical engineering and material science engineering. After graduation, she wants to work as a cosmetic chemist developing hair and skin products. Her interests include beauty, dance, and issues of social justice. In her free time, she loves to attend church, watch YouTube videos, and going for runs. She would spend the last $20 to her name getting her nails done, has been a competitive gymnast for most of her life, and is also deathly afraid of bees.
Michelle Yu
""Be miserable. Or motivate yourself. Whatever has to be done, it's always your choice.""
Michelle is a senior from New York majoring Biology with a double major in Psychology and a minor in Biomedical Engineering. She would like to eventually go to medical school and start her own clinic in a developing country. In her free time, she enjoys swimming, running, sleeping, writing, watching Netflix, and being a YouTube fanatic. Michelle likes to collects pennies from every place she’s traveled to. She had two differently shaped thumbs, and once when she was little, she was stung by a jellyfish in Maryland and a lifeguard peed on her leg to ease the pain.
Donna Lee
""A man must be big enough to admit his mistakes, smart enough to profit from them, and strong enough to correct them""-- John C. Maxwell
Donna is from Brooklyn, New York and studies biology with a double major in psychology. She hopes to go to med school and be a physician that interacts with people of all ages and from all backgrounds. Her interests include swimming, basketball, soccer, and volleyball. Sadly, she lacks the talent to actually play by any of these games’ rules. Some people compare Donna to a sloth. She hopes it’s because of their similar sleeping and lounging habits, and not because of any physical similarities. Donna also sleep walks, sleep talks, grinds her teeth, tosses and turns, and kicks people. She pasically exercises more when she’s asleep than when she’s awake. And of course, when someone likes sleeping, eating is probably that person's second most favorite thing. She loves cooking and trying new foods, despite all her random food allergies. Donna also likes listening to music and playing the piano. Despite being afraid of heights, she actually loves pra the thrills and sceneries that only accompany heights. She is proud to have been the first of her sisters to travel outside of the country.
Kenneth Li
Kenneth is from New Hyde Park, New York and is a rising senior studying Biology and Psychology. He is currently applying to dental schools and hopes to matriculate right after graduation.

She is a master cake decorator, hates running but still signs up for the Pittsburgh Marathon every year, and enjoys discussing and trying to remedy social inequality, race issues, poverty, and affordable access to quality education. She would rather spend her money on concert tickets than food, but still believes that she can definitively out-eat anyone in any kind of vegetarian-friendly eating competition. Wei is so uncoordinated that she almost fell down a waterfall once.
William Casazza
""Iron rusts from disuse; water loses its purity from stagnation... even so does inaction sap the vigor of the mind."" -- Leonardo da Vinci
Will is a rising junior from Barrington, Rhode Island, and is majoring in computational biology. His ultimate goal after graduation is to work in industry either developing diagnostic models/tools or working with synthetic biology and genetic engineering. Will’s interests include genetic engineering, parallel algorithms, epigenetic regulation, and probably some sort of math. In his free time, he likes to go long distance racing and long distance running, playing the upright bass, and listening to jazz. And, you know, just hanging out. He plays an impressive range of instruments including guitar, upright and electric bass, trombone, piano, ukulele, and melodica. He’s involved with the jazz scene at CMU and around Pittsburgh once playing in a large ensemble and occasionally gigs in small combos. He is secretly very interested in ethics and social issues.
Max Telmer

The Students
Ethan Alley grew up beneath the blue sky of Albuquerque, NM, where he became accustomed to greasy breakfast burritos, eye-watering cowboy coffee, and long drives. A sophomore, Ethan studies biology and computation and began his microbiology career culturing bacteria off of household surfaces. He is interested in applying nature's design and the tools of computation to the technical challenges of sustainability. When not juggling protein gels or scribbling in his lab notebook, Ethan can be found listening to podcasts, walking around outside, or drowning black beans in Sriracha hot sauce.
Lydia is a rising sophomore at Harvard College concentrating in Applied Mathematics. She is from New York City and attended Stuyvesant High School, where she was active on the New York City Math Team. She has previously conducted research in computer science at the Research Science Institute at MIT. She enjoys swimming, piano, and will miniprep for chocolate.
Elizabeth is a sophomore in Lowell house, studying Human Developmental and Regenerative Biology with a secondary in Classics. While she's lived in a variety of places such as California, Germany, and Japan, I currently hail from Massachusetts. She loves art, ancient history, poetry, photography, nature, biology, and God. Elizabeth's been interested in science since she asked for a chemistry set and telescope in elementary school, but she truly found her love of biology in the Travis AFB Clinical Investigation Facility, helping to use medical-grade honey to control infections of antibiotic resistant bacteria in traumatic wounds as an alternative to antibiotics.
Sylvia is a junior at Harvard College concentrating in Neurobiology. She is from North Potomac, MD and went to Thomas Wootton High School where her area of expertise lied in computer science and graphic design. She had worked previously at the National Institute of Health doing a range of projects from researching the progression of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis to data analysis of hemophilia patients. Her passions however lie somewhere between studying human behavior, artistic expression, and not being “normal”. She enjoys sunsets, long walks on the beach, and frisky women.
Ben is a sophomore at Harvard College concentrating in Applied Mathematics. He grew up in Medfield, Massachusetts and attended the Roxbury Latin School. Prior to joining the Harvard iGEM team, Ben had worked with a number of different labs ranging from the USDA Sugar Beet and Bean research unit at Michigan State University to the Cardiovascular and Metabolic Disease group at the Novartis Institutes for Biomedical Research in Cambridge. His primary fields of interest include protein and genome modeling and improving the implementation of programming in biological research. When he is not in the lab, Ben enjoys sailing, football and Super Smash Bros.
Instructors and Advisors
Neel Joshi, Ph.D.
Super Awesome Instructor
Neel is an Associate Professor of Chemical and Biological Engineering at John A. Paulson Harvard School of Engineering and Applied Sciences. He has authored 11 publications and holds two patents.He is developing new biomaterials constructed from engineered proteins and peptides. The overarching goal of his research is to extract innovative design principles from materials and systems that are the product of natural evolution and recapitulate them in synthetic systems where their physical properties can be precisely tuned to suit biomedical and biotechnological needs. Current projects employ a range of approaches, including synthetic chemistry, protein engineering, directed evolution, and molecular biology. Working with the Synthetic Biology Platform, Neel has developed a novel protein switch platform that is able to convert the presence of certain biomolecules into a readily detectable signal. This work is being further developed for use in diagnostic applications for the tracking of disease biomarkers in bodily fluids and food samples. Another project associated with the Programmable Nanomaterials Platform is focused on engineering the molecular composition of bacterial biofilms to convert them from pathogenic substances into useful materials with non-natural function, such as filtration devices and catalytic membranes. Neel also has interests in mechanically responsive systems for drug delivery that take advantage of force-induced protein unfolding to release drugs on-demand in living systems.
Marika Ziesack
The Advisor Who is in the Land Above (The 5th floor)
Marika is a Graduate Student in Pamela Silver's laboratory.  She works on engineering microbes for renewable production of chemicals. She did her undergrad studies at the University of Heidelberg in Germany in Molecular Biotechnology. In 2008 she participated in the iGEM competition as a member of the Heidelberg team which sparked her interest in synthetic biology. In her graduate studies, Marika develops tools for metabolic engineering of microbes and applies those for the production of commodity chemicals such as fertilizer and fuel.
Matthew Niederhuber
The Advisor with the Graphic Skillz
Matthew studies the cyanobacterial carboxysome, its structure, biogenesis, and potential synthetic applications. He is also involved in the lab’s ongoing work engineering bacteria to perform diagnostic and therapeutic functions in the human gut. He is interested in developing novel biological systems to address environmental and global health issues, and hopes to earn his PhD in Bioengineering.
Chris Wintersinger
The Instructor Who Got Stuck With Us
Chris Wintersinger is starting as a PhD student in bioengineering at the Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences. He is proudly Canadian and has been affectionately named “Wizard-singer” by his undergraduate colleagues since he is responsible for training them in methods of molecular biology and scientific research. When he is not helping students with their experiments, Chris is typically on his laptop contemplating how evolution may be leveraged with synthetic biology to develop protein biomaterials. On rare weekends that Chris escapes the lab, he may be found on mountain-tops, beaches, his bicycle, or anywhere where he can be active and in the great outdoors.
Isaac Plant
The ""Boss"" Instructor
Isaac is a Ph.D. Candidate in Bioengineering at the John A. Paulson Harvard School of Engineering and Applied Sciences. He has his Masters of Science in Philosophy and Public Policy for the London School of Economics and Political Science. Isaac’s work focuses on harnessing the unique biology of cyanobacteria to construct new microbial engineering paradigms. He is also interested in the policy and ethics of biological research, and has far more opinions than is generally considered healthy.

After severals weeks of brainstorming and team meetings, we decided to focus on the implementation of cell-free biosensors. As there was no local expertise in working with cell-free systems, we had to read a lot of literature and developed the cell-free biosensors on our own. All work described in the wiki, including project identification, lab work, securing sponsorships, writing about our topic on the wiki and human practices work, were done by ourselves unless otherwise stated.  We discussed our topic with several experts and lecturers. Without the support of the people named below, we would not have come so far in our project. These are the people we want to express our gratitude to.
General support
Prof. Dr. Jörn Kalinowski gave us the opportunity to participate in iGEM by providing us with our own laboratory and the resources of his work group.
Prof. Dr. Kristian Müller participated in our weekly team meetings and supported us with advice and equipment.
Tore Bleckwehl, Lukas Rositzka, Matthias Ruwe, Manuel Wittchen: A huge thanks for your endless patience when listening to our problems, your willingness to help and for motivating us to give our best. You all did a great job in advising us. It was a great and fun time with you.
Timo Wolf, as a former iGEM member, helped us with sponsoring and advice.
Modeling support
Dr. Petra Lutter (Mathematical Methods in Systems Biology, Faculty of Biology) gave us an introduction into modeling and gave us advice during weekly meetings. Thank you for your great guidance and for always being there when we had questions!
Analytics support
Vera Ortseifen assisted us in preparing and measuring samples for the protein identification via MALDI-TOF/TOF.
Julian Droste, as former iGEM team member, helped us with his knowledge of SDS-PAGEs and EMSAs.
Dr. Marcus Persicke measured the standard row of gamma-Hydroxybutyric acid via HPLC-MS for us.
Material support
The work group Microbial Genomics and Biotechnology allowed us to use their laboratories and equipment and showed great patience when we occupied many of the facilities.
The Wendisch Lab allowed us to use their microbioreactor system for cultivation.
The work group Fermentation Technology allowed us to use their laboratory facilities.
Dr. Raimund Hoffrogge helped us with his knowledge of protein-DNA interaction and allowed us to use the Ettan DIGE scanner of the proteomics laboratory.
Dr. Dieter Tanzer, Head of Advanced Analytics R&D at Merck KGaA, advised us regarding paper-based analytics and provided us with paper samples suitable for analytic purposes.
MACHEREY-NAGEL GmbH & Co. KG sponsored us with filter paper MN 827 B for our paper based Cell-Free Protein Synthesis.
Munktell & Filtrak GmbH sponsored us with two different laboratory filter papers C350L and FN3 for our paper-based Cell-Free Protein Synthesis.
Construction and Technical support
Marco Radukic designed the model for 3D printing.
Dipl.-Ing. Thomas Schäffer realized our 3D printing model with his 3D printer.
Nadine Rodrigues de Carvalho assisted us with operating the Ettan DIGE scanner.
CFPS support
Dr. Michael Jewett, Associate Professor at Northwestern University, Evanston, Illinois, gave us valuable hints about the storability of crude cell extract. He commented on our thoughts and ideas which helped us establishing cell-free protocols.
Dr. Zachary Z. Sun gave us valuable hints regarding cell lysis and extract purification. He shared his thoughts about the impact of cell-free systems with us.
BANDELIN electronic GmbH & Co. KG support informed us about how to calculate the energy input of the sonifier we used. This was really helpful to generate highly active cell extract.
Human practices and biosafety support
Dr. Mathias Keller evaluated the biosafety of the biosensor system ""plasmid repressor interaction assay"" with us.
Prof. em. Kathryn Nixdorff commented on our dual use report and provided valuable insights in both ethical questions and legal situation and proposed additional ideas for the implementation of biosecurity risk assessment.
Prof. Alfons Bora who provided insights in the guidelines and proposals of the Leopoldina and the German Ethics Council as well as aspects of ethical council for research. He read and commented our dual use report and provided ideas of the implementation of biosecurity in our project, such as the contact of an ethics council.
Constantin Teetzmann proposed his idea of possible improvement of biosecurity risk assessment within iGEM as well as within the research community itself.
The Federal Office for Consumer Protection and Food Safety for a statement about its responsibility and the current legal situation in Germany. The interviewed member shall remain nameless.
Prof. Bohner provided insight into the current responsibility of the ethics council at the University of Bielefeld and the necessary measures to extend those responsibilities.
Nils-Christian Lübke provided advice on language style and structure of our report with patience.
Joseph Ayar provided insights in the legal situation of dual use and biosecurity in the USA. His contribution is marked as quote.
Dr. rer. nat. Andreas Bermpohl provided advice about test strip and the usage of heavy metal detection
Dr. Christiane Bettin talked to us as representative of the THW (Federal Agency for Technical Relief) about the usage of our test strip for their purposes.
Dr. Rüdiger Gaydoul provided us with information about water contaminants.
By the way, what is this Bielefeld-CeBiTec?"

I'm David Urick, a sophomore chemical engineer from Phoenix. I joined iGEM to learn more about biology. Two of my favorite things are sports and food, and I think Tom Hardy will win an Oscar over Leo in 2016. See you at the Jamboree!
Advisers
Jeffrey Bouffard
Technical & Moral Support
I’m a PhD candidate in Bioengineering. I had to be a part of Northeastern’s first iGEM team because I believe that advancing synthetic biology is going to make this an even more amazing time in history to be alive. Serving as a graduate student advisor for the undergraduate team was great fun, and it was rewarding to watch the team members grow and make progress over the summer.
Sanjin Hosic

In 2013, Sanjin joined Cubist Pharmaceuticals where he developed and optimized downstream purification processes for preclinical, clinical, and commercial small molecules. Sanjin's current research is focused on bioMEMS and microfludics.
Caitlin Kramer
Technical & Moral Support
I work on elaborating the protein-mediated mechanisms of DNA damage and tolerance, a better understanding of which can help us combat antibiotic resistance and cancer development. My ongoing growth in science is fueled by the passionate and knowledgeable people in this city-sized idea incubator which is Boston. I believe that computational ability and biology are not just running in parallel--they are on a collision course.
Hema Madaka
Technical & Moral Support
I am a 2nd year Masters student in Chemical Engineering at Northeastern University. As a chemical   engineer, I have always had a passion for renewable energy and biofuels. Since global warming has   become very pervasive, people have become more aware of its negative effects and want to switch to   alternate sources of energy such as biofuels. After graduation, I would like to start a company of my   own. It was a great learning experience as an advisor for the iGEM team and was satisfying to watch the   team progress over the summer.
Marissa Puzan
Technical & Moral Support
Marissa joined the ABNEL research group and Northeastern University in the fall of 2014, where she is currently pursuing a PhD in Chemical Engineering. She received her bachelor’s degree in Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering from the Georgia Institute of Technology in 2013.  Marissa’s research focuses on designing an in vitro, tissue engineered model of the intestine, combining the epithelial cell layer, enteric neurons, and luminal components. She looks to use this model to study the affects of various toxins and metabolites on enteric neural signaling pathways, intestinal inflammation and immune response, and epithelial cell barrier composition. The developed model may lead to new developments in the treatments of neurogastroenterological diseases, such as autism, depression, or irritable bowel syndrome.
Alison Wirshing
Technical & Moral Support
I graduated from the University of New Hampshire with a BS, and my undergraduate research involved methods for growing microalgae for biofuel production and genetic engineering of the microalgae Dunaliella. My initial graduate research at Northeastern University was on a collaborative project where I worked in both the Lee-Parsons Lab (Chemical Engineering and Chemistry Departments) and Cram Lab (Biology Department) studying lipid production and gene expression in the microalgae Chlorella vulgaris. My current graduate work in the Cram Lab is on understanding the role of the actin cytoskeleton in mechanotransduction and tissue contractility using C. elegans spermatheca.
Instructors
Lisa Amelung
Technical Support & iGEM Guru
I am a graduate student from Hannover, Germany, currently enrolled in an exchange program in a Neurobiology lab at Northeastern University. When I heard of this year’s iGEM team I was reminded of my time as a student in the 2014 Hannover iGEM team. I thought that this would be a great opportunity to share my knowledge with Northeastern’s iGEM team. Although I could only help while advising, I had a great time meeting the team and gaining the insight into a project that has great potential. This project stands out because of its novel approach of producing proteins in microalgae.
Dr. Godoy-Carter
Technical Support & Guidance
Veronica Godoy-Carter is an Associate Professor at Northeastern University. Her research group is interested in studying a multiple protein complex formed by components involved in important DNA transactions when cells are exposed to DNA damage. This is a condition that induces the expression of error-prone DNA polymerases, the activity of which might lead to mutations. Their long-term goal is to learn about the mechanisms that regulate the activity of error-prone Y family DNA polymerases. They use bacteria as a model system and especially Escherichia coli. Due to its relative simplicity, studying basic processes in bacteria will render mechanistic insights that would be difficult to attain directly in more complex systems.
Dr. Lee-Parsons
Technical Support & Guidance
Carolyn W.T. Lee-Parsons is an Associate Professor at Northeastern University, jointly appointed between the departments of Chemical Engineering and Chemistry / Chemical Biology. Her research interests involve engineering the metabolism and regulation of natural products from cultures of medicinal plants and biofuels from microalgae to improve the supply of critical pharmaceutical compounds and the productivity of biofuels.
Irina Santourian
Technical Support & iGEM Guru
I am a graduated exchange scholar from Hannover, Germany working on a collaboration project in Erin Cram’s and Carolyn Lee Parsons’ lab at Northeastern University. By coincidence I noticed the foundation of the first Northeastern iGEM Team. As an emerging scientist I wanted to share my scientific knowledge with the iGEM team and to support the teams efforts to gain an understanding of the production of proteins in microalgae.

Being a team does not mean we do everything as a team. Actually, doing so would not be optimal. Being a team according to us is that everyone contributes in their own way, with their own set of skills and ideas to the project. In our case, our project is considerably voluminous. It has a few different modules, each with their own challenges: some electrical, some mechanical, some software and even some human oriented. Of course, we had help from our instructors and professors. With that in mind, this page is intended to attribute, for every person that contributed to our project, the work they have achieved to make this into a reality.

Our team
Our team is located at the University of Sherbrooke, in the province of Québec in Canada, and formed of students and instructors from various fields of expertise: electrical engineering, software engineering, molecular biology and microbiology. The multidisciplinary nature of our team has allowed us to create a complete laboratory automation platform comprising hardware, software, and wetware.
The students taking part in this team are attending their final year of college. However, only a few of those are actually born and raised from Sherbrooke and its surroundings.  The team members originate from different regions and demographics throughout the province. The diverse and varied minds and ways of working from everyone came together as a whole as every member weighed in with their contribution, to achieve a shared vision on what the robotic platform should be. The team's representatives are all interestsed in common subjects such as biology, engineering and robotics. The iGEM competition is seen as a great and interestsing challenge.

Dimerization Domains
Experimental Workflow
After choosing potentially viable split sites and the dimerization domains, our team set out to clone a large set constructs and test them in HEK239T cells. For each indicated split site, we created 6 split pair variants - 3 using the different dimerization domains, and 3 using the same domains but in the opposite orientation. This means that for each split protein, we set out to clone 12 different plasmids. Ultimately, our construct set included over 400 constructs! We actually ended up cloning and testing around 200 of these.
Below are the graphs generated by our MATLAB model for each protein that we aimed to split. The split sites are indicated in black.
Here are the two candidate integrase proteins. Learn more about our experimental motivation for developing dimerizable integrase proteins here .
TP901 was split between amino acids 154-155, 164-165, 250-251, 266-267, 276-277, 307-308, 325-326, and 453-454.
PhiC31 was split between amino acids 184-185, 230-231, 254-255, 269-270, 348-349, 539-540, 574-575, and 590-591.
Here are the two candidate RDF proteins. Learn more about our experimental motivation for developing dimerizable RDF proteins here .
Orf7 was split between amino acids 10-11, 27-28, 39-40, and 47-48. The split between amino acids 47-48 was specifically chosen in a hydrophobic region to serve as a negative control.
Gp3 was split between amino acids 39-40, 76-77, 109-110, 149-150, 160-161, 218-219. The split between amino acids 160-161 was specifically chosen in a hydrophobic region to serve as a negative control.
Here is the saCas9 protein. Learn more about our experimental motivation for developing a dimerizable saCas9 protein here .
SaCas9 was split between amino acids 180-181, 227-228, 253-254, 288-289, 310-311, 327-328, 439-440, 445-446, 500-501, 530-531, 558-559, 600-601, 633-634, 710-711, 750-751, 797-798, and 883-884. 2 splits were chosen in hydrophobic regions to serve as negative controls."

Official Profile
Central  Memorial,  is  a  senior  high  school  located  in  Southwest  Calgary,  Alberta,   Canada with a vast array of personality in it’s 1,120 students. Known for the Performing   and  Visual  Arts  (PVA)  program,  it  is  a  central  hub  where  students  come  from  all   quadrants of the city to share their talents, and work to pursue their passions. PVA, an   auditioned  program,  has  four  disciplines.  PVA  Music  is  the  largest  disciple,  and   encompasses  a  large  symphonic  band,  an  award  winning  chamber  choir,  and  a   stunning strings ensemble, a program unique to Central. PVA Theatre Arts provides a   professional  experience  to  students  interested  in  theatrical  performance,  working   frequently  with  professionals  in  the  field  who  share  knowledge  in  genres  such  as   improvisation,  film  acting,  and  everything  in  between.  PVA  Theatre  Arts  also  has  a   phenomenal technical theatre program, for students wishing to specialize in the behind   the scenes aspects of theatre. PVA Dance provides instruction in a wide array of dance   styles, ranging from  classical ballet to  contemporary hip­hop. Lastly, PVA Art teaches   young artists to work with a variety of mediums, providing a robust artistic education in   both ceramic and visual art.   Although  generally well  known  for  the  arts, Central  Memorial  is also one of  the  three   homes  to  the  National  Sports  Academy  (NSA),  with  specification  in  Baseball,   FlexSports  (individual  sports),  Golf,  Hockey,  Lacrosse,  and  Soccer.  To  match  their   highly  academic  students,  Central  has  a  strong  core  academic  program,  offering   advanced  placement  in  many  of  the  courses  offered,  as  well  as  a  wide  array  of   extracurricular clubs. This is the second year that Central Memorial has an iGEM team.   We are out to prove that artists can make great scientists too.
Meet The Team
Vladimir has been living in Calgary since day one. Growing up, he has experienced and  explored everything from the bike paths in Fish Creek to the top of the Bow. At the age of  eight, Vladimir developed a passion of photography and film­making, and carries it with him  to this day. If he is not capturing photos, or studying, you can most likely find him zipping  around from city to city on his bike. His passion for iGEM developed within the first weeks of  grade ten, and carries into many aspects of his life. From lab work to media, Vladimir does it  all.
Natalie is a grade twelve student in Central's Performing and Visual Arts program in the dramatic arts discipline. She has always had  a passion for the arts, having done private voice lessons from ages 8-16 as well as being involved in several choirs including Central Memorial's concert choir. Natalie, although always very academic, became extremely fascinated with human biology throughout high school. She worked as a research assistant in the lab of Dr. Marie Fraser at the University of Calgary during summer of 2015, work in on a biomedical research project with future application in dislipodemia and cancer treatment.  Her future aspirations are to study Life Sciences or Health Sciences and one day become a perfusionist.
Kevin Klemmer is the supervisor of the Central iGEM Team. He has taught at Central Memorial Highschool for 15 years.
Jared was once a no life, that is, until he joined IGEM -- of which then, he became a no life that does science. If he isn't in the lab, then in all likelihood, he would be attempting to learn idioms, reading papers, doing math, memorizing the quadratic formula, and devouring ice cream.
Francis Routledge is a grade twelve student who is a hard­working academic student that is  passionate about the sciences. She was initially interested in iGEM because of the amounts  of opportunity that iGEM presented. Francis is actively involved in her school community and  is a leader in many clubs and activities within her school. Outside and inside school, she  plays badminton and is on her schools’ cross country, track, badminton, field hockey, and  basketball teams. Francis is passionate about athletics, academics, and music. In the future, she would like to pursue a career in medicine.
Alexia Gendron is a simple 12th grader who spends her spare time perfecting recipes and playing piano. She enjoys reading, volunteering, good soup, Italian, and having insightful conversations. Although born in Calgary, Alberta, she was brought up in French, and attended a francophone school until her 10th grade. This has given her exposure to French-Canadian culture and taught her where to find it even if she finds herself a few provinces away from its origin. For five years she took karate and developed quite a fondness for martial arts. Despite having had to stop karate this year, she plans on starting to practice judo as soon as possible. After discovering Ronda Rousey, she found the very first person ever to move her so strongly, and she considers Rousey to be an inspiration. Right now, Alexia is focusing on the present, and is trying to enjoy her final year of high school before she graduates. Although she plans on attending university next year, she has yet to figure out exactly what she wants to study. She has always loved to learn all there is to learn and do all there is to do; she hopes to travel the world someday, meet fantastical people, and have a great collection of jaw-dropping stories to tell.
Jessica Skall is a grade 12 student at Central Memorial Highschool. She recently moved to Calgary from Toronto, and she felt that iGem would be a good place to make friends with common interests in science. Long team plans of hers include becoming an international ESL teacher. That is all
My name is Danielle and I am currently a grade 12 student at Central Memorial High School. At central, I am a part of the Performing Visual Arts program for dance. I do many genres of dance such as jazz, tap, ballet, lyrical, hip hop, and more. It takes up most of my free time. I am also a co-captain of the cheerleading team, and a member of the iGem team. Being a part of iGem is a great experience! In the future, I aspire to be a doctor, and this is why I am a member of the iGem team. IGem has broadened my knowledge and will potentially help me in fulfilling my career goals.
Zenab Bhamgerwala is a grade 12 student at Central Memorial High School. She joined the iGEM team because of the vast amount of opportunities it offered. Through central iGEM, Zenab was able to perform various procedures in the lab and gain a great amount of experience in the world of synthetic biology. Outside of school she enjoys being the programming lead of her Robotics team, sketching, reading, and running long distance. In the future, Zenab hopes to pursue her passion of biomedical studies in post secondary. Joining this team has helped develop essential life skills and reaffirm her career decisions."

Meet Dinula De Silva
I am a grade 12 student at Winston Churchill High School. I enjoy programming, playing the guitar, and watching movies. When I’m not stuck indoors, I like going running and biking. I joined iGEM because the feats of synthetic biology fascinated me and I wanted to learn more about the processes involved. I additionally wanted to develop my computer programming skills by working on the wiki and software aspect of the competition.
I wish I were adenine, because then I could get paired with U ;)

Meet Sydnee Calhoun
Hi my name is Sydnee and I am in grade 12 at Winston Churchill High School. I joined iGEM because I love learning about science and I enjoy the sciences in school. In the fall, I am attending the University of Lethbridge, majoring in Psychology and Biological Sciences. Outside of school I enjoy playing in band, reading, and teaching skating.
Are you made of copper and tellerium? Because you're cute ;)
X
Meet Jonathan Kwan
Hi, I'm Jonathan, a grade 10 student at the Lethbridge Collegiate Institute. I enjoy playing the trombone in my school's concert and jazz bands, and I also play piano outside of school. I joined iGEM because I wanted to learn more about biology and working in a lab. After high school, I plan to study either biochemistry or neuroscience, while hopefully pursuing music in my spare time.
Even if there wasn't gravity on earth, I'd still fall for you ;)
X
Meet Eyram Asem
Howdy! My name is Eyram and I am in grade 11 at Winston Churchill High School. I joined iGem because I thought that it would be a great opportunity to gain lab experience, learn about synthetic biology, and meet some groovy people; all of which happened! I love reading novels, hanging out with my friends, eating food, and having spontaneous dance parties (with only myself present of course).  I hate the sound of Styrofoam, wearing my glasses, and waking up late.
You're so hot, you might be the cause of global warming ;)

Meet Ronja Kothe
Hello! I’m Ronja Kothe, a student at Winston Churchill High School. This is my second year in iGEM and I have had an amazing time. I joined iGEM because I find the field of synthetic biology very fascinating. I also want to gain more experience in lab work, which is my favourite aspect of iGEM. However, the Human Practices component of iGEM interests me very much as well. In the future I would like to continue to perform experiments and venture out into the biomedical field. In addition to iGEM, I also enjoy playing the clarinet and going camping with my fellow Girl Guides.
You must be made out of fluorine, iodine and neon because you are FINe.

Meet Jessica Semmelrock
My name is Jessica Semmelrock. I am seventeen years old. Art and science interest me, which is why I plan to continue studying the subjects in post secondary. I joined the Lethbridge iGEM team because of the unique experience it offers. The opportunity came up a short while after I discovered what synthetic biology is and I was psyched to learn more. It is incredible that a team of high school students and a few advisors can create innovative solutions to world problems. I love getting involved in various activities, including sports, volunteering, and visual arts. A belief I hold close is that learning is the best part of any activity, which makes IGEM all the better.
They told me to choose a chemistry themed pick-up line, but all the good ones argon.

Meet Madeson Singh
My name is Madeson, I am going into grade 12 at Chinook High school. In my free time I enjoy drawing, painting, and pretty much anything artsy. My favorite things about iGEM was learning more and getting a hands on approach with synthetic biology, as well as getting to know new people.
I wish your name was Avogadro, because then I would already know your number.
X
Meet Tiffany Dang
Heyos mayos! My name is Tiffany Dang. This fall I will be attending the Schulich School of Engineering at the University of Calgary for a degree in chemical and biomedical engineering.I joined iGEM again because I continue to be intrigued with its novelty. Genetic engineering combines scientific research, engineering principles and imagination to find a new perspective to currently unsolvable problems. iGEM has given me the experience to be a part of this process while making friends along the way. Outside of iGEM, I like being active playing rugby, racquet sports, hiking, and rock climbing.
You're so hot you denature my proteins.
X
Meet Anileen Pageni
Hey y'all! My name is Anileen Pageni and I am a grade 11 student at Winston Churchill High School. I joined iGem because of my interest in science and being around like- minded people! I spend my free time making people laugh, watching countless movies exploring and trying to be artsy. My favourite aspect of iGem is the human practices because I love getting involved in the community. I also really enjoy the lab work because you learn something new every time.
You're so hot you denature my proteins.

Meet Kaatje O'Donnell
My name is Kaatje and I am in grade 12. This is my first year in iGEM and it has been an experience completely unlike anything else I've done. In the past, I haven't been extremely interested in the sciences, so iGEM has been a great introduction to bio and chem, although I have been more involved in the human practices and ethics side of things. Outside of iGEM, I enjoy competing gymnastics, playing the drums, and writing. I love being a part of iGEM!
Are you full of beryllium, gold, and titanium? Because you are Be-Au-Ti-full ;)

Meet Arashk Gasroddashti
Hi! My name is Arashk Ghasroddashti and I'm currently in my grade 11 year at the Lethbridge Collegiate Institute. I joined iGEM so that I could experience the amazing opportunities that synthetic biology has to offer, first hand. In addition, getting a chance to work with a team in all sorts of different environments (lab, planning meets, work groups, etc.) has been absolutely invaluable! I plan to eventually move onto university where I will study a field with a strong focus in biology and (hopefully), in the end become some sort of surgeon. Things I enjoy include Judo, computer work, business, movies and of course, learning about the sciences.
When I saw you, it was dopamine, oxytocin, and serotonin at first sight ;)

Meet Aum Patel
Hello, I am Aum Patel. I just started my school year as a Grade 11 at Lethbridge Collegiate Institute. This is my first year as part of iGEM. It has been a fascinating and valuable experience. I plan to pursue a career in medical field (but, these plans change every week). Although I live on tight schedule, when I do find the time I like to spend it by travelling, sleeping(mostly), polishing my skills (and counting them), and engaging in programs such as iGEM.
I've got my ion you ;)
X
Meet Landon Zanewich
My name is Landon Zanewich and I am starting grade eleven this year at LCI. My hobbies include playing video games, board games and card games. I also enjoy playing sports like hockey and volleyball. In my free time I enjoy seeing friends or playing games. I have been playing hockey all my life and have been skating for almost as long as I could walk. I joined IGEM because I wanted to see the power that synthetic biology has to change the world for the better. I am still unsure of what career I will pursue in the future, but I am sure that it will involve science.
You must be awfully cool because you're 0K in my books ;)
X
Meet Chris
Hi there, I'm a third-year biochemistry student at the University of Lethbridge, looking to move forward into Engineering. This is my 4th of iGEM, and second year advising the High School Team. It's been a very rewarding experience to see how these students can grow and adapt to the challenges that iGEM throws them.
""Don't give me a pickup line. Just let me say don't do drugs, stay in school, whatever.""
X
Meet Kieran
Hello, my name is Kieran McCormack. I am currently finished my second year of Biochemistry at the University of Lethbridge, which allows for a nice contrast between the normal science world and the more defined synthetic biology world. I enjoy doing new activities and have found great joy from being an adviser on the team; whether that be through new friendships, communications or spread of knowledge. I have enjoyed learning about myself throughout this year, and hopefully I can continue to do so into the future.
You're so hot, you might be the cause of global warming ;)
X
Meet Wesley
My name is Wesley Mosimann, I am going into my third year of university as a dual major in biochemistry and physics. My passion is science, but I also enjoy reading, rugby, Super Smash Bros. and teaching. This is my 4th year in iGEM, and my second year as an advisor.
I'm more attracted to you than fluorine is to an electron ;)
X
Meet Yoyo
Hello! I am Yoyo and this is my 4th year iGEMing! I was born in China but moved to Canada in 2003. Currently I’m entering third year as a Chemistry major at the University of Lethbridge. As always I come back to iGEM to see the creative ways teams tackle their projects, and to input our own creative projects! Outside of school I enjoy skiing, throwing Frisbees, staring at computer screens for hours on end, and playing Super Smash Bros.
Are you a scientist? Because I lab you ;)

Meet HJ
Originally from Germany I moved to Canada in 2005 to start a research group on the structure and function of the bacterial protein synthesis machinery, a cellular process targeted by over 50% of the known antibiotics. I am intrigued by the molecular design and function of this essential bio-nanomachine. I try to unravel the underlying design principles in order to enable the rational design and engineering of novel bio-nanomachines. I am essentially asking the question if such novel bio-machines can be constructed from simple and fundamental principles or are these assemblies just to complex. Well and that’s why it was extremely easy to rope me into doing iGEM.
What did one sister chromatid say to the other? Stop copying me!

Meet Brian
I am a Structural Biochemist and new to Synthetic Biology and iGEM. I love the idea of being able to make whatever I want in the lab. Previously I have used NMR and X-ray crystallography to look at protein-protein interactions. My wife is a Biochemist also, which makes dinner conversation interesting (for us anyways).
Biochemists do it in triplicate."

Each team must clearly attribute work done by the student team members on this page. The team must distinguish work done by the students from work done by others, including the host labs, advisors, instructors, and individuals not on the team roster.
Can we base our project on a previous one?
Yes! You can have a project based on a previous team, or based on someone else's idea, as long as you state this fact very clearly and give credit for the original project.
Why is this page needed?
The Attribution requirement helps the judges know what you did yourselves and what you had help with. We don't mind if you get help with difficult or complex techniques, but you must report what work your team did and what work was done by others.
For example, you might choose to work with an animal model during your project. Working with animals requires getting a license and applying far in advance to conduct certain experiments in many countries. This is difficult to achieve during the course of a summer, but much easier if you can work with a postdoc or PI who has the right licenses.

Janki Patel
""Hi! My name is Janki; I’m a junior pursuing a B.S. in Biochemistry, minor in chemistry at Stony Brook University.  My involvement with iGEM began almost two years ago as a team member of Stony Brook’s first iGEM team, and continued this year as an undergraduate advisor for the team.  As it was my first research experience, I was intrigued to learn how creative science could really be, especially with the way humans can engineer biological systems to allow them to perform a brand new function.  After having experienced research for two years, I learned that science was the field that I wanted to pursue for the rest of my life.  Combining my research experiences with my clinical experiences as a volunteer in the children’s playroom at Stony Brook University Hospital, I am inspired to continue these passions with both research and a career in pediatric neurology.  As I embark on this long journey of schooling, I absolutely intend to continue contributing to my community in terms of research, volunteering, and mentoring other students.""
Janki was a huge part of our team this year, and was our main correspondent for advice.  Whenever there was something we needed to know, we went to Janki.  We were lucky enough that Janki was on campus this summer researching, and she had some free time to swing by our lab now and again to answer our questions and quell our confusions.  She used her experience from being on the team last year to help troubleshoot our protocols, as well as get in touch with the professor and faculty around us.  Janki was a crucial support during our research this summer, not to mention her contributions and organizing during the spring semester and start of the fall semester.
Nicolai Alexandre Aquino Tayco
Nicolai Alexandre Aquino Tyco, aka Nic, was a great help to our team this year.  In the spring semester, Nic, along with everyone else, was able to help keep us on track and help us develop our idea.  For the first half of the summer, he was abroad and couldn't help us in person.  However, he had left us plenty of information about making media, and other protocols that helped us figure out where to start.  Thanks to Nic we also learned to keep a spreadsheet available of our inventory, to avoid losing time due to lack of reagents.  At the end of the summer, he also helped us figure out a lot of iGEM specific information and helped guide us to the jamboree.
Gurkamal Kaur
""Hi! I’m Gurkamal, but most people call me Kamal! I am currently a senior at SBU, majoring in Biology and specializing in Developmental Genetics. While I do wish to attend medical school and continue research in the near future, my path to this academic plan was certainly not straight. When I was still short enough to sneak under the MTA subway turnstiles, my dream was to be a full time mermaid when I grew up. (A result of religiously watching The Little Mermaid everyday) Soon enough, my dream was not only crushed by the realization that I cannot swim, but the poor job output of course! I will not further embarrass myself by listing the rest of the jobs I aspired to have, but I will share how I came to realize my passion for charity work and the medical field.
Almost ten years ago, I was on a family trip to India, where I visited orphanages for disabled and sick children. It was there when I realized that people yearn for things I take for granted everyday, especially healthcare. This experience sparked my curiosity in the health field and soon enough it cemented my drive to truly immerse myself in the world of science and all that it can do to help others. Besides working towards this goal, I keep myself busy with plenty of other hobbies and activities such as traveling, volleyball, and volunteer work! Most of all, I love spending time with family, friends, and of course my dog, Oreo!""
Kamal was also a great help in developing our ideas into a project.  Kamal, along with the others, helped us search for current issues and new solutions to those issues.  She helped our ideas grow, and got us on the right track for solidifying our project idea.  In addition, she was able to come into our lab over the summer and answer questions we had about both wetlab and iGEM in general.  Kamal was a key adviser this summer, and helped us make the project what it is.
Helen Liu
Helen helped organize meetings and keep things running smoothly at the start of our journey.  She kept us in the loop about possibly opportunities for telling people about iGEM as well as fundraising.  She made sure we were doing what we had to do each week in order to get a good start this summer.  Helen was instrumental in helping our team organize themselves and prepare for a summer of incredible research.

My favorite lab moment is the time I accidentally broke Chris' water bottle.
Ann Lin
Year:
Sophomore
Major:
Biochemistry
Minor:
Bioengineering and Political Science
Description:
As a child I loved putting together puzzles. My first encounter with the largest puzzles in the world, science, happened during third grade at a science fair. I realized at the time that science is not just a simple puzzle but a puzzle with many missing pieces. So I made it my goal, at that instance, to find as many of these missing pieces as possible in my lifetime.  I wish to pursue an MD/PhD in neurobiology and aspire to become neurosurgeon.  So hello, my name is Ann Lin.
Chris Giuliano
Year:
Sophomore
Major:
Chemistry
Description:
Hello; my name is Chris Giuliano and I am a sophomore Chemistry major. I’ve wanted to be a scientist for as long as I can remember. As a child, I would spend hours watching my grandpa perform magic tricks before my eyes; but I was never content with the visuals - I needed to know how the magic worked. I view science in the same way, and hope to earn a PhD in my path to peeking behind the magician’s curtain. My non-science interests include Art, especially drawing with pen and markers, reading, and spending too much time watching Netflix.
Favorite Lab Moment:
The time Andrew shattered my water bottle by throwing it off the balcony on “accident.”

Description:
I might just be a typical Long Island kid who loves relaxing at the beach. Most summers I can be found in Montauk, Fire Island, Cupsogue, and some of the Babylon beaches. Just call me a beach aficionado. But this summer I can definitely say that my time has shifted from being a beach bum to being a pedant. Worry not, you didn’t misread. That means someone who pays attention to minor details.  To be honest, I do love science. I’m amazed that the very atoms that compose our cells are the products of a dying star. When a star explodes, the hydrogen and helium fuse into heavier elements, like carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen—the ingredients of life. And those products govern the behavior of our cellular processes. I think that’s incredible.  In the future, I aspire to be a pediatric oncologist and also conduct cancer research. I guess you can say I’m pre-MD/PhD, if that exists. Until then, I can be found hanging out on campus, or maybe sneaking in a beach day.

For as long as I can remember, I have always wanted to be the first United States ambassador to Venus. But, because of the lag in space travel inovations, my dream will have to wait. In the meantime, I am pursuing some of my other passions such as nurobiology. I enjoy learning how small chemical imbalances in the brian create large disruptions in gross function and personality. My other hobbies include playing the violin, making discreet sarcastic remarks and drawing cartoon chickens (or do I…?)

Hello! Like many of my team members, I really love science. I can remember starting to love science when my third grade class took a trip to the planetarium. My tiny self loved the whole experience while my best friend cried and ran to our teacher because she was afraid. As I have gotten older I can see that a space career is not in my future but research and medicine have taken over my interests. When I grow up I want to work in an oncology research lab finding causes and cures for the disease. When I am not loving science or studying I like to cook vegetarian food, hang out with my friends, listen to music, and play outside. Thank you for reading my bio!

Description:
Contrary to popular belief, my full first name is just Max. I enjoy a variety of things such as model building, tennis and golf, but my number one passion would probably have to be eating. Eating is an art and I really love sitting down and taking my time to enjoy a meal.
In all seriousness, I really do love synthetic biology. The applications are endless and it can potentially solve our current world problems such as pollution, disease and provide renewable energy. If natural selection can achieve all of what is on Earth today, imagine what we can accomplish once we completely harness the power of genome manipulation. Like many of my teammates, I am on the pre-med grind and see myself continuing the struggle for the foreseeable future. This bio is getting long so I’ll cut it off here… if you’d like to know more, I take sandwich donations and I’d be happy to sit by a campfire and tell my life story.

I was born in Brooklyn and have never known anywhere else. You could say that I am the typical city kid. Being here on Long Island has been a huge shift in pace from the city and it definitely took some getting used to. Now that I have been in college for a few years I am beginning to enjoy the quiet, slow pace of Long Island. In the future, I want to go to medical school and become a doctor. While it isn’t easy, I enjoy the challenge and learning that happens in the classroom, in the lab, and in the hospital. I want to gain experience in the healthcare field to one day achieve my goal.

Born in the wild woods of upstate New York, my favorite thing to do is ruminate in nature. Add some interest in drugs and you get pharmacology. My favorite tree would probably be a cedar, because of its divine smell, but the balsam fir needle is much more proper in my opinion. I like to be spontaneous and am probably down for a bike ride at any time of the day.

Description:
Ever since I was young, I’ve been obsessed with deciphering the world’s mysteries.  Why is that wall red but that one green?  How do I know which way is up?  Can entropy be reversed or is the heat death of the universe inevitable?  You know, typical kid stuff.  Either way, my natural curiosity has only grown as the apparent magic of the world has revealed itself to me.  With each answer found, two new questions appear.  This ever growing curiosity, combined with a knack for problem solving, has led me to where I am today.  My plans for the future are just beginning to really take shape, but I know I want to continue on to grad school and work in bioengineering on a molecular level.  I also hope to explore and experience the world, because out of an incredibly expansive universe, I have the unique opportunity to experience Earth.  Relative to the size of the universe, not many sentient lifeforms can claim that!

Hello, my name is Kathryn and I really love musical theater and interpretive dance. I hope to have a career on Broadway one day. Actually, that’s a lie. I just thought you might be bored of reading about how much everyone on this team loves science. Sorry to disappoint but, you guessed it, my passion is genetics as well. When I grow up I hope to be a genetic engineer or perhaps a synthetic biologist (iGEM wasn’t able to scare me off). I love taking my ideas and creating something tangible with them; specifically treatments for life-threatening diseases. While I do occupy most of my time with science, I also really enjoy doing yoga, watching horror movies, reading news articles, and being outside.

I was born in and lived most of my life on eastern Long Island.  I love the outdoors, including kayaking, swimming and dirtbiking.  I’ve been an ocean lifeguard for 5 years.  My real passion is learning.  As odd as it is, I like spending many hours reading textbooks.  I find the details of life, such as biochemistry and cell biology very interesting and revealing.  I’ll be at Stony Brook for two more years to complete a masters in biomedical engineering, then I’m hoping to go to medical school.
Favorite Lab Moment:
Watching movie trailers on the projector.
Salwa Anam
Major:
Biomedical Engineering
Description:
I have added a lot of different professions to my “What I want to be” list as I grew up. There was a time when I wanted to be an astronaut, there was a time when I wanted to be an architect. But becoming a surgeon was always destined to top that list eventually. I want to go to medical school after my graduation. In terms of research, I am interested in space life sciences, biorobotics, tissue engineering and genetic engineering. In future, I would like to continue doing research in one of my area of interests.
I was born and raised in Bangladesh and came to United States at an age of 17. It was the beginning of a new and challenging chapter of my life. Photography is my hobby and I love to spend time in nature and admire its beauty. Other than that, I also enjoy traveling, playing badminton, sudoku, singing and most importantly, sleeping.
Favorite Lab Moment:
When I make short trips from our lab to the other labs of the building to seek help or meet professors.

Junhao Zhao
I am 16 years old and a student in Guangdong Experimental High School. I am the Director general of the Association Union, which is a student organization that supervises all the Associations in our school , and also ran JA company during my school time. I spend most of my spare in learning knowledge of advanced technology and synthetic biology.

Hongxu Lin
I am from the Guangdong Experimental High School, due to the enthusiasm for the cutting-edge scientific researches,I am currently taking part in the igem 2015.
The advanced science thories like relativity and quantum mechanics  attracts me, despite this, after years of brain storming, I have got the idea that the basis of the human research is that we want to have a better life, and therefore, a better world. Nowadays, the earth is facing the great problem of global warming and many other problems. In order to make the world be better, we must secure the bottom line of our survival-----food and inhabitable environment, which has a lot to do with the synthetic biology.
These days, our natural environment is exacerbating, and the development in the space exploration is not enough ------as said in Interstellar, the nearest star is 1000 years away, it is going to take us forever to get there. So it will be a good idea making our planet better instead of  finding another better planet.
After a few times of learning, I get to know that the brand new branch of the biology-------synthetic biology is the key to make our Earth better. The development of synthetic biology is swift once it was founded, the era which artificial biological system research dominates is coming. The revolution is coming, a better world is coming.

The development of synthetic biology is swift once it was founded, the era which artificial biological system research dominates is coming. The revolution is coming, a better world is coming.

The Attribution requirement helps the judges know what you did yourselves and what you had help with. We don't mind if you get help with difficult or complex techniques, but you must report what work your team did and what work was done by others.
For example, you might choose to work with an animal model during your project. Working with animals requires getting a license and applying far in advance to conduct certain experiments in many countries. This is difficult to achieve during the course of a summer, but much easier if you can work with a postdoc or PI who has the right licenses.

He Yunfei
Hi,everyone!I am a student in the college of biology science in CAU. It is a great honor for me to take part in this great event. I love doing experiments with my teammates. Wish all of you have great time in Boston, good luck.
Yang Zi
Hello, my name is Yang, Zi. It’s such a pleasure for me to join the iGEM team in our university and get to know the fascinating synthetic biology. Every time when we had a team conference or a journal club, it really gave me a lot of new ideas. The feeling of discussing interesting questions with interesting people can be incredibly excellent. During the process of finishing our project, I also found my future research interest---system biology in signal transduction. Now I can proudly say I know what I really want, and that’s because of this wonderful year together with iGEM!
Hu Yao
This is Ricky. Complexity and simplicity both lies within me. I love to explore and elaborate. One day if I die accidentally, my last words would be: see what I've found !
Wang Chen
It is a wonderful experience to take part in the iGEM contest, I have learned a lot through the process. Our project aims to put forward a possible application of synthetic biology in agriculture. We hope to solve the problem of herbicide resistance someday if possible.

I learned a lot about iGEM from the team, and shared a variety of wonderful ideas. I hope to provide more and useful suggestions, as well as technical supports, for the team in the future.
Wang Na
CAU_China is a family. Everyone learns, thinks, discusses, and has fun in this family. I learn fresh ideas from all members. Most of the time, I feel like a happy student more than an instructor. And synthetic biology brings me so much surprise and fun. As a teacher, I hope students to explore more fields and pay more attention to the effects on life.  Synthetic biology can change the world! But I have so much regret in this year. I don’t have enough time to talk with team members. I don’t pay more attention to the latest advances. But I will not change the belief that we can make more beautiful life by synthetic biology!

Tom Hodder
Adam Denyer
I have recently completed an MRes degree in Synthetic Biology at UCL and participated in the competition last year.  My main interests lie in the fields of Bioinformatics and Systems Biology.  I decided to help the London Biohackspace 2015 iGEM team as I feel it is the perfect arena to expand the DIY-bio community and enable more people outside of industry and academia to participate and enjoy this emerging engineering discipline.
Victoria Butler
Coming from a background which is a mix of haute couture fashion , science, and business the linking thread in my work is a passion for understanding how things can be made, new materials and techniques in future and exploring what new applications will emerge.   I set up a bespoke leather label which pushes the boundaries of accessory evolution.  This gave me the time to study with coding, 3d design programs and 3d printing.  I have focussed on material structure development and the evolution of materials and material manufacture which has led me into areas of synthetic biology and the effect of the substructure on surface potential.

Who We Are
The UCSC 2015 iGEM Team consisted of 24 undergraduates, who have come together with a single goal in mind. Bringing forward an array of skills, tools, and techniques, we were able to break our team into micro-teams such as:
Outreach
Grant
Video
Graphic Design
Social Media
Wiki Development
Thanks to these teams we were able to fund not only our project, but fund the travel expenses to Boston. For a complete list please check our Attributions page.
Finally with such a large team we broke our main project into sub projects.

Hi! I am the team leader. I am on my third year of biotechnology engineering. Before I started to study biotechnology I was a professional swimmer. After finishing my career, I plan to start my over-graduate studies in marine biotechnology while I manage to bring biotech products to the market that will have a positive impact in the lives of people. We started Graph-Gene with the goal to take it beyond an academic project. We’ve still got a long journey to go but we are sure that both graphene and synthetic biology will play an important role in the new technological revolution, and we want to be part of it.

I have lived and worked in the UK, Mauritius, Bolivia, Colombia, Honduras and now  Mexico . I have a keen interest in the regulation and biosafety of synthetic biology and its potential for education in biological sciences.
I feel the voice of youth should be heard in  biotechnology  and synthetic biology  oversight and regulatory circles.
Giovanni De Cisneros
Giovanni De Cisneros
23 years old
I am in charge of the business development and project management of Graph-Gene.
I like to work with technology and innovation projects because they require truly research and passion. From a business perspective we always try to sell the products but sometimes we miss some important things, and dynamic groups of people bring that A-game that transforms a good project into an excellent project, because everything we do, must be done in the pursuit of value.
During my free time I like to hang out, cook, play guitar, basketball and videogames.

During out iGEM project we tried our most to work as a team with all elements of our project from the wiki design, interlab study to the actual iGEM project. In this way we were all able to understand all elements of our project. We also had designated tasks to do, which allowed us to efficiently finish our work. However there were times where we did not fully understand an idea or a certain protocol such that we got support from members of the Genetics Department at the University. At the same time all our work wouldnt be possible without the sponsorship we had got.
The University of Leicester iGEM team would like to thank anyone and everyone who has helped us throughout this project. Many people have given their knowledge and most importantly time to help ensure that our project was as successful as possible.
Firstly we need to thank Dr Richard Badge and Professor Raymond Dalgleish without whom the team wouldn’t exist. Their constant supervision and support has been invaluable.
Professor Julian Ketley, for providing his expert knowledge of bacterial expression. The guidance given was the basis of our project.
Amelia Veselis for the use of the lab and the induction into it. We were lucky enough to have extensive lab space in which we filled with our mess.
Dr Rob Mason, for the use and guidance of his fluorometer. This enabled us to accurately determine the success of our transformation experiments.
Dr Richard Haigh, for aiding us in understanding the colonisation of bacteria in the gut. As this subject is the core of our project, the advice Richard provided added a lot to our project.
Dr Alexandra Woodacre, for aiding in the acquisition of bacteria for our testing.
Last but most definitely not least, we would like to heartily thank the biology department of the University of Leicester for their support in fundraising, meeting deadlines and for the use of their equipment and buildings.
All other work was carried out by the iGEM team members. Everyone on the team over the course of our project has contributed to every aspect of the project with no specific lab roles being designated.
Thanks and acknowledgements for all other people involved in helping make a successful iGEM team

Each team must clearly attribute work done by the student team members on this page. The team must distinguish work done by the students from work done by others, including the host labs, advisors, instructors, and individuals not on the team roster.
Can we base our project on a previous one?
Yes! You can have a project based on a previous team, or based on someone else's idea, as long as you state this fact very clearly and give credit for the original project.
Why is this page needed?
The Attribution requirement helps the judges know what you did yourselves and what you had help with. We don't mind if you get help with difficult or complex techniques, but you must report what work your team did and what work was done by others.
For example, you might choose to work with an animal model during your project. Working with animals requires getting a license and applying far in advance to conduct certain experiments in many countries. This is difficult to achieve during the course of a summer, but much easier if you can work with a postdoc or PI who has the right licenses.

""What I cannot create I do not understand.""
- Richard Feynmann
Attributions
When we first met at the end of March, we had no idea how much time we were going to spend together this summer and how many amazing things we would learn and achieve. After extensive research, we came up with a project that soon caught our attention and we were eager to reach the many goals we had set ourselves for September. Long discussions with our PhD student advisors and supervising professors helped us focus on the best of our ideas and left us highly motivated to work. We designed every component of our genetic circuit, did our best to model all possible outcomes, and created this wiki to document our results. During this intense summer, we were lucky to be supported by a lot of people whom we would like to thank on this page.
Advisors
We were lucky to count on the support of six advisors who were always there to help us solve experimental problems, find bugs in our models, and reassure us about our progress during our weekly meetings.
Lukas Widmer advised us with the modeling and always managed to magically identifying our yet undiscovered bugs and typos.
Daniel Gerngross helped us take our first steps in primer design, introduced us to the power of Gibson Assembly and supported us with materials and helpful advice.
Sabine Österle gave us valuable advice when the data seemed to go nowhere and the wiki freeze was coming closer.
Margaux Gastor helped us find mistakes in our mammalian cell protocols and helped us with the operation of FACS and the microscope.
Christian Jordi patiently showed us how to keep mammalian cells alive and created the PDMS chip.
Janina Linnik helped us with our models and brought us in contact with some experts who offered us valuable insights into the world of medicine.
In addition, we would like to thank Lukas Widmer, Sabine Österle, Daniel Gerngross, Margaux Gastor, Janina Linnik, and Maximilian Bahls for generously providing us with accommodation in Basel.
Scientific support
Within the whole department a lot of people generously helped us out by offering either lab supplies or time and advise.
Prof. Sven Panke, Prof. Jörg Stelling, Prof. Yaakov Benenson, and Prof. Savas Tay critically reviewed our ideas and guided us throughout the process.
Erica Montani taught us how to properly operate the microscope and answered our many questions.
Verena Jäggin explained how to use FACS and to interpret the data.
Michal Stanczak kindly provided us with SK-BR-3 cells.
Markus Jeschek povided us with a last hope for a strategy to Annexin V display, sharing his knowledge, cryos and plasmids.
Matthias Mehlig, Tino Frank, Johannes Thoma, Gaspar Morgado, Michael Junkin, Bartolomeo Angelici, Max Endele, and Martin Etzrodt offered us advice and materials.
General support
Niels Bürckert emphasized the importance of safety during our stay in the lab.
Myriam Moisan improved our logo design and gave us some further ideas.
Maximilian Bahls, Sabine Österle, Lukas Widmer, Daniel Gerngross and Margaux Gastor offered us a place to sleep when nights were getting too short to commute back and forth from home to the lab every day.
We would like to thank of all the participants in our interviews for their collaboration!
The BSSE shop team kindly assisted us with the purchase of all the required materials.
We would like to thank our sponsors"

Anja MICHEL Biology
I grew up in a small village where the cow to inhabitant ratio is close to one. I prefer bacteria disassembled into their components rather than whole and healthily living.
Labwork is like cooking and I love both. Besides my life as a lab rat for iGEM, I am addicted to music, good books and my bike.
I chose to join the iGEM team because like cluttering myself with work.
Anna FOMITCHEVA KHARTCHENKO Biotechnology
After four years of a love-hate relationship with bacteria, iGEM presents an interesting new chance!
Charlotte RAMON Biomedical Engineering
Until now, I have never stepped foot in a biology lab...but I'm glad to be part of the team as a modeller!
""What I love: organization!""
Harun MUSTAFA Computational Biology and Bioinformatics
I can get computers to make magic happen...but only in small doses, so you can’t ask for too much.    I’m a computer scientist who happens to have an interest in biology. When I’m not tanning in front of a monitor, I like to play music (guitar and various folk lutes) and go on spontaneous hiking trips.
""In theory, theory and practice are the same. In practice, they’re not."" - Yoggi Berra
Lisa BAUMGARTNER Biochemistry
ETH and I have been together for almost 4 years now and we are excited to spend some more time together this summer! Hello iGEM!
Michael ""Mike"" MEIER Cell Biology
Being the oldest member of the team with an MSc title in immediate sight makes me feel–well–old. But hey, I have made most of the common mistakes already, which can be considered an asset. After countless lab hours tormenting plants I am now eager to set my evil mind once again on my old nemesis, E. coli..

Our team consists of 11 students and two instructors. We are from Ocean University of China (OUC) which is a comprehensive university with particular strengths in oceanography and fisheries science. We come from 5 different colleges, majoring in biology, biotechnology, ecology, bioengineering, aquiculture, mathematics and industrial design.
In the processing of iGEM, we are trying to figure out what we could do with synthetic biology. And we will never forget the time we fight together. Because, it was the best of times, it was the hardest of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of busyness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of disappointment, it was the season of light, it was the season of darkness, it was the spring of attraction, it was the summer of fever, we had nothing before iGEM, we had everything after iGEM.

I wanted to do something with my dear friends in a brand-new field. The synthetic biology for me was a field I never touched or even heard before I joined in this team. What made me excited was that I could do the dry lab work as a student major in biology. Though it was a challenge for me in constructing modeling, I still did this with passion.

“I’m now seriously considering doing a biotech masters degree because I feel like I’ve found my niche through this project. Lab work was a bit intimidating at first but all that was needed to get over that was experience. What else do you need to know about me?...hmm...I love Harry Potter!”
Finally, I bought my very first ice cream maker, planning on making ANY ice cream (peanut butter cups was a huge success) and just waiting for my Belgian waffle maker. Also, apparently I talk in my sleep in Slovakian.

From my participation on iGEM 2015 I expect to find the question!
IvanaChemist
“iGEM has helped me see that science can be something collaborative and involved. I am amazed by how much working with the people who will be impacted by our device has influenced and improved the research we are doing.
I always imagined that scientific research would be a very solitary pursuit, never getting out to engage with the problem you’re trying to solve and the people you’re trying to help. Instead, through iGEM, I’ve learnt that there is a growing need for empathy and a strong social conscience in science and I am incredibly happy that we are moving this way.”
VickyChemist
“Starting this summer I was fully aware of what biology is capable of, but implications had only been an after thought. After going to Amsterdam to help incorporate human practices I have realised how important this link is as it can really drive the research.”
Brooke Biologist
“I can see that biology and computer science complement each other quite well. Synthetic biology adapts engineering and even computation and logic principles which makes it highly accessible to someone without a biology background like me. I would be interested in getting more informaticians to realise this sentiment, as it’s truly exciting!”
AndreeaComputer Scientist
“Working on iGEM really has been an experience I am proud of. Connecting different technologies from contrasting disciplines and getting them to work together to build something cool has changed my view on science. Over the summer I have been able to change my intrigue for synthetic biology into practice and this has definitely made me more open minded about my career plans. ”
Aseem Computer Scientist
“This summer has really allowed me to immerse myself in science and become far more comfortable in a lab environment. There has also been the chance to interact with a very diverse group of people, gaining their opinions on biology in the process, and learning how research can affect the community as a whole.”
Liusaidh Biologist
“ I’ve always been interested in ethics and whether we can say anything meaningful about it, or whether it’s all, strictly speaking, nonsense. In some ways I leaned towards the latter, but now that I find myself in a position to potentially make a difference in lives of people caught in real struggle, I feel as though I have a chance to do something good.
Patrick Philosopher
“Doing this project has allowed me to realise that biology is more than just squishy stuff; it can potentially offer solutions to many problems from space exploration to oil to world hunger. I’m really excited about starting my career and exploring the possibilities of synthetic biology, that’s how iGEM has been so transformative for a fledgling scientist like me. “

Meet our Team members
Mhairi Davidson
Studies: Genetics
Hi, I'm Mhairi, and I'm an undergraduate student at University of Glasgow studying Genetics. After I graduate, I plan to do a PhD.
Andrey Filipov
Studies: Genetics
Heya! I’m Andrey, a 22-year-old Genetics student at the University of Glasgow. Taking part in the University’s iGEM team has been an amazing and incredibly rewarding experience. Thanks to my supervisors and teammates I learned how to take care of a lab and conduct experiments, while surrounded by love and positivity. This have helped me maintain a genuine and long-lasting attraction to Biological Sciences. I hope this experience helps me become a Dr. Dre of Life Sciences.
Ye Yang
Studies: Biomedical Engineering
Hi, my name is Ye Yang, and in my most of the lab time, I'm coding with our wiki pages. I'm quite happy with this experience, apparently before iGEM I have no idea how to deal with the website things, but after the whole summer learning HTML, CSS, I think now I can play with it. For my future plan about my study career, I'm trying to do well in GRE test, and hoping to study in an American school next year.
Adele Cook
Studies: Biomedical Engineering
Hi guys, my name's Adele! I've been working mainly on Photography and Product Design for this project, but also on Human Practices - in other words, anything that's not biology -  leave that to those who know what they're talking about! Not that I don't love biology - in fact, once I graduate from Biomedical Engineering it's my dream to go on to medical school to become a doctor one day - wish me luck! iGEM has taught me a wealth of new lab skills and knowledge about synthetic biology, but most importantly, to know when not to have another can of Red Bull.
Charlotte Flynn
Studies: Genetics
Hi, I’m Charlotte! I’m 20 years old and I am a Genetics student at the University of Glasgow. This summer participating in iGEM has taught me how to effectively use time in the lab and has greatly strengthened my experimental technique. Thanks to my teammates I have also smiled and laughed the most I have during a rainy Glasgow summer! After my forth year I plan to do a PhD and then take time out to travel the world and share valuable life experiences with those close to me.
Vilija Lomeikaitė
Studies: Genetics
Hi, I’m Vilija! I’m a Genetics student at the University of Glasgow and the tallest member of our team (I can get you that flask from the top shelf). Thanks to the iGEM and despite all the rain, I had the best summer of learning, falling in love with science and making friends with these crazy and sweet people known as my teammates and supervisors. After graduation, I plan to use iGEM experience and successfully utilise E. coli in the synthesis of the Philosopher’s stone. Or do a PhD – I’m still trying to decide!
Dimitra Lountzi
Studies: Genetics
Hello, I'm Dimitra and I'm one of the geneticists in the team! This summer, I gave up the glorious greek sun to participate in iGEM, and hey, no regrets at all! During the project I worked mostly on the repressors and the bi-stable switch. After I graduate my plan is  to do a PhD (preferably somewhere warm) and to travel.
Cara Seggie
Studies: Molecular & Cellular Biology
Hi there! I'm Cara, I'm 20 years old and I study Molecular & Cellular Biology here at Glasgow University. For me, being able to be part of Team Glasgow for IGEM 2015 has been an amazing experience. I have learned how to plan ahead and work efficiently in a scientific environment along side my other team members, who have all become good friends. After I graduate, I plan on taking some time out of studying to travel and see the world, and then return to do a PhD. In the future I hope to work in Cancer or Cardiovascular Research.
Josh Hanson
Studies: Molecular & Cellular Biology
Hi I’m Josh and I am one of the team’s molecular cell biologists. Being part of the Glasgow team has been a really helpful preparation for my undergrad project next year .When I graduate I hope to take a PhD in plant science hopefully  in the area  of either  food or fuel security.
James Provan
Studies: Genetics
Hi, I'm James and I've spent too long in the lab. Quote of the project: ""Positivity is not compatiable with my brain""
Max Derksen
Studies: Astrophysics
Hi I'm Max, I volunteered my summer to help code the wiki. Quote of the project: ""don't change my functions!"" Meddling biologists......

We got a lot of help in the pursuit of our project, namely in the following working areas by the listed people:
Acquisition of sponsors
Prof. Dr. Ulrich Hahn (University of Hamburg)
Prof. Dr. Zoya Ignatova (University of Hamburg)
RNA modeling
Prof. Andrew Torda (Center for Bioinformatics Hamburg)
Prof. Dr. Janusz Bujnicki (International Institute of Molecular and Cell Biology, Warsaw)
Proof-reading of the presentation
Lisa Roth
iGEM-Registration, primer design, ordering of reagents
Prof. Dr. Zoya Ignatova (University of Hamburg)
Dr. Andreas Czech (University of Hamburg)
Operation of the devices in the lab, finding reagents
Prof. Dr. Arp Schnittger & AG (Biocenter Klein Flottbek, Hamburg)
Choice of a strain of bacteria
Prof. Dr. Jeff Tabor (Rice University, Houston)
Providing us with the pezT plasmid
Prof. Dr. Anton Meinhart (Max Planck Institute for Medical Research, Heidelberg)
Providing us with software and support for the risk assessment
Wüpper Management Consulting GmbH
Design of the sequencing primers
Leon Felipe Schmidt-Jimenez
Intensive support during the final days
Maximilian Anders
Cristian del Campo
However, most of the work was obviously done by us and even if everyone was somehow working on everything, we want to try to give a little credit to particular persons, where it is due.
Team Leadership (Henning)
He was the one that had the initial idea to even launch an iGEM Team in Hamburg. From then on he has been the indispensable member of the team that always pushed us forward, had the best ideas and is truly inspiring. Henning is the engine of our team and besides his brainwork, he managed to guide us through difficulties and through experimental dead-ends. We want to thank Henning for his spirit and leadership.
Web Engineering (Vincent and Maurice)
Vincent and Maurice spent an incredible amount of time trying to learn HTML and CSS, which they had never used before, to code up an appropriate website for our team’s online representation. Together they wrote several hundred lines of code and struggled through many long debugging sessions. We are really thankful for their endurance and studiousness.
Wiki Editing (Dana)
Dana was the editor-in-chief of our wiki as well as the main contributor of texts to the wiki. Her articulate and nonchalant style of writing makes reading our wiki pages a real joy. She always managed to be politely insistent, when people forgot to document their projects on the wiki in time and is mainly responsible for the completeness and elaborateness of our wiki.
Art Design (Sonja)
Our favorite biology student and art design hobbyist Sonja created our beautiful logo and put a lot of effort into the appearence of our poster and presentation. She has drawn a whole bunch of different logo versions, almost until getting carpal tunnel syndrome, before we had finally chosen one. By always stoically enduring our - partially even contradictory - change requests, she has definitely earned our deep respect.
Modeling (Maurice and Vincent)
Maurice did the network modeling, while Vincent was responsible for the RNA structure. They were both utilizing many skills and a lot of knowledge, that they acquired at their respective bachelor theses at the Center for Bioinformatics Hamburg. Without their broad understanding of the mathematical and physical foundations, we could not have worked out the theoretical background of our project so well, which is why they contributed to our work in an extremely significant way.
Risk Assessment (Kira)
Kira has worked very closely with WMC to tailor their software suite QSEC specifically to our needs. She has spent countless hours with exhaustively assessing and compiling assets, processes, threats and vulnerabilities, while at the same time reading lots of German and European standards and guidelines for risk management in laboratories. Her job has surely been the most bureaucratic one and she has proven really strong nerves carrying it through.
Safety (Nikolas)
Niko was responsible for the safety of our project and was reliably checking all used organisms and chemicals. Moreover, he was constantly reminding us of every important deadline and filled out all the respective forms.
Workplace (Artur)
Artur was the main person in charge for the autolysis part of our project and arranged our workplace. Due to his pessimistic nature he called in many cases in a necessary way diverse ideas into questions. Because of him some rational decisions were made and some less were not. He kept our workbench always clean and tidy and every reagent and culture in place. Thanks to him, we never had trouble finding the correct buffers and our cells were always incubated at the correct temperatures.
Ethics (Julian)
Julian organised the symposium and held the talk on the Ethics of Emerging Technologies. He was always calm and attentive, when everyone else was freaking out because of approaching deadlines or failed experiments and has been our last resort, when it came to time-critical jobs, which had to be done late in the evening or on weekends. He could more than compensate his slightly less comprehensive lab experience with his commitment and working morale.
Notebook (Heiko)
Heiko was a very strict and rigorous guardian over our notebook and was admittedly sometimes a real pain in the ass, when we were too slow in maintaining our online labbook or not abiding his sophisticated formatting rules for the physical one. It is solely his merit, that we probably have the most consistently formatted labbook of all iGEM teams. Hence, it is a real pity, that there is no special award for that.

STUDENTS
ADVISORS
SUPERVISORS
Name: Aimée Lamb
Current Studies: Anatomy and Physiology
Role: Our twitter cover girl, hashtag extraordinaire and day brighten-upper
About: Aimée never fails to cheer us up in the lab with her chit chat and big smile. She’s very relaxed when it comes to following a protocol! But somehow still manages to get the job done. She is also very determined even after the 18th attempt at cloning the same gene! Her favourite thing in the world (other than iGEM of course…) is anything sweet. It’s fair to say that she is totally obsessed with cake!
Most likely to be arrested for: Breaking into a patisserie and stealing all the sweet stuff!
Name: Caitlin Connolly
Current Studies: Molecular Genetics
Role: Spicing up our Friday nights and keeping our benches tidy!
About: She’s very strict when it comes to following a protocol! Caitlin loves her biology and takes lab work very seriously – although her PPE could do with some work after an incident involving her fingernail and a centrifuge. She cheers us up with her great puns, sassy chat and never fails to snap us out of our bad moods!
Most likely to be arrested for: Because of her fear of flying, being drugged by friends and causing an emergency landing.
Name: Callum T-C
Current Studies: Biochemistry
Role: The Wiki Master and Wet Lab.
About: When Cal’s not teaching himself HTML for our wiki, you’ll find him in the gym. He likes to oil up and flex his muscles, as his second ambition in life is to be the next Arnold Schwarzenegger.  Cal was hot to learn HTML, due to us having no students who study computers science or design. He’s a bright lad with an uplifting Scottish voice. If you see him in Boston ask him to say “There’s been a murrr-der!”.
Most likely to be arrested for: Open container, 5.9% ABV.
Name: Conner Craigon
Current Studies: Molecular Microbiology
Role: Our personal encyclopedia, maker of incompetent cells, and the scapegoat.
About: When he’s not being in the lab you’ll probably find him playing video games or with his head in a geeky book. He’s a scatter brain but an extremely hard worker and an integral part of our iGEM family.
Most likely to be arrested for: Consumption of illegal quantities of energy juice!
Name: Edward Smith-Uchotski
Current Studies: Physics
Role: Telling rubbish jokes and winding up Hannah.
About: When he’s not flying planes or in the boxing ring, he’s hard working in the office. By office I mean pub.  He is overly chatty, so it was his big mouth that helped us out with Human Practices. There’s not a forensic expert in Dundee that hasn’t heard him talk. If you see him in Boston, you can keep him.
Most likely to be arrested for: More likely to be the victim of a crime, after pushing his fellow team-mates over the edge with his sense of ‘humour’.
Name: Fiona Macfarlane
Current Studies: Mathematical Biology
Role: Dry team mother figure. King of MATLAB.
About: Fiona is a 4th Year math-bio student. When she isn’t mothering the dry team she’s mothering her foot soldiers at the Girls’ Brigade. Her hobbies include listening to Scottish folk and world domination. Her name has become synonymous with mathematical perfection: “Wow you just totally Fiona’d your homework”.
Most likely to be arrested for: Assisting her friend rob a bank because they asked her politely.
Name: Hannah Boyd
Current Studies: Physics
Role: Stabbing things, mathematical modelling and hitting Ed every time he tells a bad joke.
About: Some people just want to watch the world burn, Hannah would rather just watch Ed burn. She’s a hardworking Northern Irish Gal, who packs a punch when it comes to working. Her mathematical brain has helped crack many tough problems. Her creative touch has given everything a sparkle through the whole iGEM process. Fun fact about Hannah is she can still say the whole alphabet even after 10 Guinness’s or 7 G ‘n’ T’s.
Most likely to be arrested for: Going on a GTA style rampage by first stealing a car, driving it over a ramp into the air and crashing it into a flying helicopter. Then stealing another car and having a wild car chase, similar to fast and furious scene, she would then kidnap a Kim Kardashian. This is because this woman adds nothing to science. After a long standoff with armed SWAT Teams Hannah would then hop in her Batmobile which she had hidden all along, and drive right through them.  Following a second lengthy car chase she would eventually be stopped by a fully armed apache helicopter. Finally she'd be arrested for being the most bad-ass Northern Irish lass to have ever walked the earth. I’d drink to that.
Name: Lucy Armstrong
Current Studies: Molecular Genetics
Role: Wet lab work and wiki wizard
About: Lucy is a true thoroughbred Scottish lassie. When she was born she came out playing the bagpipes. Aside from eating haggis and throwing massive logs around, you’ll find her working in the wet lab. Her wealth of knowledge in biology and genetics is astounding for such a young scientist. After spending most of her university summers on lab placements. She’d be a great asset to any team.
Most likely to be arrested for: Putting a cat in a bin.
Name: Manuel Blank
Current Studies: Biological Sciences
Role: Chromate Sensor
About: Jack of all trades is the description that is most suitable for Manu. He joined iGEM because he felt it’s the most amazing way of encouraging entrepreneurship in undergraduate students. He came into iGEM as a Biologist, but ended up being anything from a Physicist to a Networking Guru. He’s a short German man with a great sense of humour, and he’s always pushing us to strive out of our comfort zones.
Most likely to be arrested for: Civil disobedience - Being arrested after causing a riot by eating a steak at the world vegan summit.
Name: Thomas Eve
Current Studies: Mathematical Biology
Role: Dry team and all round principal component analysis (PCA) enthusiast.
About: Tom is a 3rd year math-bio student with a keen interest in all things science and will tell everyone, and their granny about PCA. When he’s not in the dry lab you will find Tom enjoying Brazilian music and discussing the ins and outs of politics, and life, with team mate Conner.
If you are very lucky Tom will even perform a fantastic cover of the female part of 'A Whole New World' from Aladdin, or even some classic rap songs.
Most likely to be arrested for: : Stalking the politician, Jeremy Corbyn.
Name: Fatima Ulhuq
Current Studies: PhD in Molecular Microbiology
Role: Mr Motivator, twitter fanatic and pizza provider in times of need
About: Fatima is our resident iGEM veteran. She is our go to gal when nothing seems to work! She runs a very tight ship. Fatima has showed us how to do pretty much everything in labs and has managed to avoid a mental breakdown despite the whole iGEM team nagging her!
Most likely to be arrested for: Drunk and disorderly behaviour (drunk on sugar that is!)
Name: Lucas J. Morales
Current Studies: PhD in Cell and Developmental Biology
Role: Modelling/Advisor
About: A passionate man who is known for bringing meat and cheese in a carrier bag to a meeting. It doesn't sound particularly strange until you know that it wasn't packaged. It was just in the carrier bag, jostling about. Regardless, he's always been keen to help, but did leave it to the very last minute.
Most likely to be arrested for: Stealing a penguin and going out with it.
Name: Frank Sargent
Current Studies: Stress manager
Role: Instructor
About: He is a microbiology professor who is on one-man undercover mission to make Dundee the best place in the world to study biotechnology. He told us iGEM brings joy, freedom and excitement into research. He lied.
Most likely to be arrested for: Irresponsible mixology
Name: Tracy Palmer
Current Studies: Microbiology
Role: Instructor
About: She is the Head of the Division of Molecular Microbiology, part time lab worker and full time counsellor. She said “ iGEM is the best part of the undergraduate curriculum! It’s Intense, tiring but 100% worth it”.
Most likely to be arrested for: Hula-hooping
Name: Fordyce Davidson
Current Studies: Mathematics and Budgets!
Role: Instructor
About: He has recently taken over as the Interim Dean for Science and Engineering. Sadly, his magnificent maths skills are now used to balance the books. At the start he said “iGEM is an intensely rewarding experience for students and instructors. I am privileged to be able to work with this talented interdisciplinary group each year.” We are not sure if he still thinks that.
Most likely to be arrested for: Murder by Karaoke!

Axel Levier
Hello everybody,  I am Axel Levier, a student in engineering school at Polytech Marseille in the field of bioengineering and biotechnology. I am a highly motivated student, passionate about the technology development, particularly in the field of gene therapy and cell therapy. That is why I wanted to take part of this wonderful adventure of iGEM. I am one of the manager of the iGEM's team. My mission was to find partnerships and grants to provide to our team the funding necessary in order to carry out our experiments. I also helped my team with the interlab study and cloning for the project
Camille Houy
Hello everybody! My name is Camille Houy and I am in the last year of engineering school in Marseille. I am especially studying biology and biotechnology. I decided to participate to iGEM competition because it is a really exciting experience. It is a great opportunity to create and develop our own project and try to make it real! I also loved this experience because I met a lot of friends as passionate of science as me. During this summer in the lab, I was one of the team leader and I played a role in promoting the progress of the project and scheduling the experimentations.
Simon Arias
Hi everyone ! I'm Simon, 22 years old. I'm studying Bioengineering at Polytech Marseille (Aix-Marseille Université). The other team members will tell you : I'm a bit (too) talkative! I try to always keep smile even if I must admit it wasn’t easy this summer ... The manipulations: it's not my thing! I prefer to manage records: budget, partnerships, beyond the bench, etc. What else? I love the food! I hope our American hosts are ready because I’m really planning take advantage to the buffet ...
Laure Linet
Hi! I’m Laure, like a huge part of the team, i'm a student in fifth year of a bioengineering school in Polytech Marseille. I love biology especially veterinary pharmaceutical. iGEM concept is really attractive because it allow to meet teams which come from all over the world. I hope to gain from sharing ideas and experience with other members of iGEM.  I enjoy going out with friends and make shopping ! I look forward to seeing all of you at Boston !
Myriam Choukour
Hello! I’m Myriam and I study biotechnology at Polytech Marseille. I am happy to have the chance to be part of Aix-Marseille University team. During the summer I participated in the experiments. Despite problems and obstacles we encountered it was an enriching and unforgettable experience that allows me to discover synthetic biology. And I can’t wait to meet you all during the Jamboree.
Marion Aruanno
Hi! My name is Marion, I’m a student at Aix-Marseille Université where I’m studiying Microbiology and Biotechnology. I heard about synthetic biology and the iGEM competition by a friend of mine who told me he wanted to participate this year. So I follow him in this adventure. For me, this competition is an opportunity for meeting people, discovering others cultures, others projects and I could not miss that. I had the idea of our project by walking on a chewing gum and I was very happy that the other members were excited to work on it. Then the team became my second family, the lab my second house but I do not regret anything!
Yoann Chabert
Hi! My name is Yoann, I’m studying Biochemistry at Aix-Marseille Université. I never heard about the iGEM competition until my girlfriend was on the team this year. She asked me to join her but at this time I was not really interested. But she was so obsessed with the competition and she was always talking about it. Then, one day, I asked the team if I could join them even if it was already May. Everyone was very nice to me and told me YES! Now, I can say that it’s a really good experience and I really enjoyed it.
Ella De Gaulejac
Hello! I am Ella, a master student from AgroParisTech, Paris Institute of technology for Life, Food and Environmental Sciences. I love the concept of iGEM, it allows us to concretely apply the techniques we are learning on topics that matters to us, such as environmental matters. I am very interested in linking biology with other disciplines, art for example. It has been a great experience to be part of the AMU team this year. Outside the lab, i love sailing!
Daniel Calendini
Hello, my name is Daniel Calendini and i'm a undergraduate student in neurosciences and i was very interested by iGEM even if it isn't my speciality. I learned a lot of things during this summer and tried to help as much as possible. I'm glad to get the chance to participate in this team.  I wasn't in charge for something precise, i tried to get involved in as much tasks as possible and it was quite hard.
Sébastien Nin
Hi everyone, I'm Sébastien and I’m currently in first year of master in bioinformatics, structural biochemistry and genomic. I wanted to participate to the iGEM competition because synthetic biology is a very interesting field of biology. The competition allows us to create our own project by starting with nothing. I heard about synthetic biology thank to James Sturgis who is one of our supervisor and one of my teacher. He explains to our group what is synthetic biology and I decided to participate to this fascinating competition. I'm currently envisaging to participate next year but I'll be more present on computer than on workbench.
Wilson Goma
Hi, I am Wilson, currently in the fifth year of bioinformatics at Aix-Marseille University.Hmm ... What to say about me ? Really fascinated by biology, I think that nature is the best handyman and I particularly like studying his work with computational tools and statistical methods.There are two years (a little more now) , with a friend we have discovered synthetic biology, that was really exciting and we had fun to imagine all kinds of application to save the world. We were promised us that one day we participate at the largest synthetic biology competition.That's how two years later, we are part of the iGEM family. In our team I was mainly in charge of modeling and software.
Yassine Cherrak
I’m Yassine a student in fifth year of a bioengineering school called Polytech Marseille. Passionate about biology I’ve heard about IGEM competition 3 years ago and I always wished I participated! Now here I am! I’ve been working on the chew-fight project and I definitely loved it! Besides I also like music, traveling, partying and sport, especially football for what I’m a big fan of Olympique de Marseille!

Ron Duan - Developer
I'm Duan Rong,from HFUT in China.Coding can help me to relax.In my team, I'm a algorithm engineer. I design some algorithm to deal other teams' abstract and help my team to show you a beautiful data picture. In fact,  there are so many teams' abstract,obviously, I didn't read all of them. My friends and I read some and tagged some key words. Next, I wrote a program to learn what we did and computer help us to finish all of the abstract.The result is good enough.You will find computer is amazing!

Team
Our team is made up of engineers first. Biologists and students of medicine complete us. We were brought together by the Georgiev Lab whose engineering and innovation philosophy set the bar for all ideas and activities. We strive to make synthetic biology more comprehensible and bearable to engineers. This is the first iGEM team from the Czech Republic, hence the name. In a country where synthetic biology still lacks footing, we are outsiders in all of our respective departments. This brings us close together to a single lab from multiple corners of our country. In the months of hard work on the IOD band, our own band of friends and lab geeks emerged.

The team includes a mix of complementary expertise. In the end the work was naturally split between the members. It goes without saying that these wiki pages are primarily the work of all team members with constant language corrections and comments on content clarity coming from the advisors and instructors. The advisors kept the work on track and helped answer the tough questions. They also checked wiki pages related to their field of expertise. The instructors were closely involved keeping the message clear and the team on track to reaching the goals. The external help was indispensable providing advice on medical topics where team expertise was lacking.

THE IOD BAND IDEA is really a mix of two amazing concepts used by nature to engineer new cells: sexual conjugation and pheromone based signalling. Starting from the very first iGEM discussions in winter, the team has been fascinated by these systems and from the get-go wanted to use them to do amazing engineering. It so happened that during some unofficial yet regular beer-meetings with students and researchers from the Biomedical centre the problem of CTC diagnosis was raised. It did not take long before input-output blocks from engineering courses became IODs that work together to solve complex problems, such as diagnosis of CTCs.
THE TEAM includes a mix of complementary expertise. In the end the work was naturally split between the members. It goes without saying that these wiki pages are primarily the work of all team members with constant language corrections and comments on content clarity coming from the advisors and instructors. Below each member of the larger team is linked to their identifying tasks.
Jan Bejvl is a student at the Faculty of Medicine. He brought to the group a wealth of information regarding medical practice. In the lab he started off with the Interlab study and then played an integral role in Module 2 recloning plasmids and setting up the final assays.
Martin Cienciala is a bachelor student at the Charles University in Prague in the Molecular Biology program. He co-developed the idea behind location tags in Module 3 and designed as well as performed all the microfluidic experiments. Martin led the assembly, induction, and experimental validation of surface receptor antibodies.
Hynek Kasl was responsible for Module 1. He assembled the MATa and MATx synthetic loci, the reporter plasmids and the corresponding biobricks. Throughout the project he became sort of the team modeling and data guru providing supportive models for the CeCe simulator hydrodynamics and diffusion extensions. In Human Practices, Hynek presented the early IOD band concept to young engineering students.
Veronika Kolejáková studies Molecular Biology at the Charles University in Prague. She co-developed the idea behind location tags in Module 3 and assisted with our Human Practices progress. Veronika performed experiments to ensure yeast surface antibody production and assisted with experiments in other Modules.
Jiří Louda is a student at the department of Cybernetics. Early on he helped with the Interlab study. Subsequently he played a supportive roles in different modules as needed.
Filip Nemčko is a bachelor student at the Faculty of Sciences at Charles University in Prague. Filip provided valuable knowledge and ideas during the development of the concept of our project and the design of Module 3. He performed yeast display validating experiments. In Module 1, Filip contributed to the construction of the synthetic haploid strains.
Václav Pelíšek extended the CeCe simulator with features crucial for IOD simulations: stochastic reactions, cell-cell communication and agglutination. He did all work on coding wiki design into HTML and CSS and fabricated the microfludic chips. Václav assisted during the Interlab Study experiments and with the lab's maintenance.
Anna Sosnová was responsible for modul 2. She performed cloning, BioBrick construction and validation of the constructed parts. She was also responsible for performing the Interlab Study including construction of devices, measurements and processing of data. Anna also coordinated our collaboration with team Chalmers Gothenburg. In Human Practices, Anna was responsible for expert consultations and interviews.
THE ADVISORS kept the work on track and helped answer the tough questions. They also checked wiki pages related to their field of expertise.
Jiří Fatka is the original author of the CeCe simulator and was instrumental in helping Hynek and Václav understand  the simulator architecture and possibilities for extension. Jiří was also helpful in solving some complex HTML and CSS problems on wiki.
Pavel Fikar taught the students  basics of microfludics and showed them how to use specialized equipment. He is author of the team pictures.
Kateřina Pěchotová is the Georgiev Lab manager and so was instrumental in double checking experimental setups and making sure the lab was constantly supplied with petri dishes, media, enzymes, … and the list goes on.
Tereza Puchrová familiarised Hynek and Filip in Module 1 with the determination of mating types in S. cerevisiae. Her experience with yeast genome data also proved useful in debugging the design of the synthetic MATa and MATx loci.
Pavel Zach was the main advisor of the team. He made sure all the deadlines are met and the loose ends are closed. He supervised the Biobrick construction and submission. In addition, he provided literature and advice regarding chimeric receptors and synthetic pheromones.
THE INSTRUCTORS were closely involved keeping the message clear and the team on track to reaching the goals.
Assist. Professor Daniel Georgiev as our leader keeps the great mood in the lab and his accurate questions leads everyone to the result without any need for explanation.
Assoc. Professor Eduard Janeček provided tremendous organizational support for our team throughout the duration.
THE EXTERNAL HELP was help indeed providing advice, human practice support, and occasionally even an autoclave or a spare supply of a ligase.
We would like to thank the 'Biomedical Centre, Faculty of Medicine in Pilsen, Charles University for first of all participating in our GMO survey. Namely we would also like to thank Assist. Prof. Lucie Vištejnová' for letting us use the centre autoclave when ours went bust, for spotting us some ligase when ours was backordered, and for helping us collect all the surveys. We would like to also thank Dr. Pavel Pitule and Dr. Pavel Ostašov for sharing their experience with CTC diagnosis and for giving us helpful advice on how to improve our experiments to get better data.
Thanks to all our colleagues at the Faculty of Applied Sciences for their support during our research. Special thanks belongs to Prof. Miloš Schlegel for opening up his Introduction to Cybernetics course for an hour allowing us to present our project and synthetic biology to engineers.
Finally, we want to thank team Chalmers Gothenburg for initiating the GMO survey, processing and evaluating the data and useful advice they provided us during our collaboration.

Undergraduate Summer Team Members
 
Undergraduate Summer Team Members did all the project design, Biobrick design, novel protocol procedures, and data collections although we received advice from our graduate student advisors.
 
 
Benjamin Hsu is a full-time researcher and financial officer, and was involved with the project from the start. As financial officer he helped lead fundraising efforts and managed the research budget. Over the summer his work focused on constructing the KaiABC oscillator with Mansi and designing the applications (AANAT expression and secretion) part of the project. Some of the procedures he conducted were PCRs, Gibson Assemblies, Gel Extractions, MiniPreps, Transformations, Inductions, Western Blots, and miscellaneous basic lab protocols. He also arranged the outreach with Dr. Cauter.
 
Mansi worked on Biobrick designs specifically for the KaiABC oscillator with Kevin as well as Biobrick designs for the read-out system constructs. Along with Benjamin, she was one of two full time members during the summer so she played a large role in the wet lab work including running PCRs to clone out gBlocks, conducting Gibson reactions to put together the Biobricks, setting up induction experiments using different concentrations of Rhamnose, and conducting western blots to assay the Kai proteins.
 
As an adviser to the team who worked on the team last year and as president of the student organization, Kevin was only involved in wet lab work for a little bit, but instead mainly helped out with Biobrick design, devising specific experimental methods, helping with troubleshooting at weekly meetings, and technical/logistical support to the new members this year working in the wet lab. He also helped with the measurement calculations, Western blot densitometry, and taking 1-2 odd-hour time-points for one of the induction time course experiments. Together with Benjamin, he also helped identify and communicate with potential sponsors.
 
Ryan and Annie helped with troubleshooting at weekly meetings as well as with taking time-points for the induction and oscillation experiments. We had shifts set up for the induction experiments, since they often required taking quick time points in person at odd hours (such as 3AM).
 
Shiva helped with basic lab procedures during the final two weeks of experiments.
 
Ethan helped with some of the formatting for the website.
 
 
 
 
Graduate Student Advisors
 
We want to thank our graduate student advisors for their help. They all volunteered their time at weekly lab meetings to help us troubleshoot and they were all very responsive to our frantic emails asking for tech support. We couldn’t have done it without them.
 
 
 
Danny helped us with making competent cells, and Aaron ran us through our first Western blot. Kristen came onto the project later in the summer and is primarily helping us with giving us feedback on our poster and presentation.
 
 
We want to thank Justin Chew in particular, because he was unfortunate enough to have his bench next to ours. He provided on-the-spot troubleshooting, often late into the night when our experiments were running late. He was our go-to guy when we can’t find reagents, ran out of pipette tips, or when our gel was blotchy.  
 
 
Thanks to our remaining advisors for providing us with so much support:
-Prof. Mike Rust and the Rust Lab for kindly providing us with lab space over the past two years.
-Also thanks to Prof. Jared Lewis and Dr. Jennifer Moran for their timely advice and support when we requested it.
… And thanks to all our university and company sponsors for generous donations of lab reagents, software (Snapgene was really useful for Biobrick design!), and money to make our project possible!!!

Benjamin Hsu
 
Full-time lab rat and financial officer, I enjoy running Western Blots in the dark of the night. Currently a 2nd year majoring in Biological Sciences with minors in Molecular Engineering and Visual Arts, I hope to one day start an “innovative”, “consumer based” “biotech “startup” that will “disrupt” the status quo. Outside of class I’m is an avid marathon runner and skier.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Mansi Chandra
 
Full-time worker and team secretary. I joined iGEM to realize my dream of constructing a Jurassic Park, dare I say Jurassic World. I believe the future of genetic engineering lies in recreating a world in which majestic dinosaurs roam free. This is why I trained my skills over the summer as jack of all trades from pouring plates, designing primers, running with gels, and making best friends with western blots. 2nd year, pre(historic)-med, double major in biology and future Alan Grant. Badminton, and watching Bollywood films is what I do when I’m not in lab or envisioning a giant lizard-like future.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Kevin Yang
 
 3rd year planning to major in Biology and possibly Biochemistry. I’ve been involved with the UChicago iGEM team since my first year of college, as a part-time member working directly in the lab last summer and as a senior advisor to the team this summer, mainly helping with experimental design, project planning, and general logistics. As much work as iGEM can be sometimes, I really do enjoy the unparalleled intellectual independence and freedom that it allows for. The UChicago project this year is ironic for me due to my own kind of irregular circadian rhythms- just try searching ""UChicago all nighter"" on Google Images. My hometown is Folsom, California, my favorite food is sashimi, and my hobbies are sleeping (naturally) and playing the piano.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Shiva Kangeyan
2nd year biology major at the University of Chicago. He hail from the far off lands of Miami, Florida and is a part-time researcher with UChicago's iGEM team. Shiva chose iGEM because it was more than just a place where his pipetting and culturing wizardry could be put on display; it was a group that had interesting research. Shiva is an avid consumer of television (M*A*S*H, the West Wing, and Seinfeld are particular favorites), enjoys generally being outside, and likes to blast music loudly.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Annie Zhang
4th year biology major and statistics minor at UChicago. I come from Hong Kong, the land of amazing food and culture. This is my third year participating in iGEM, and as a senior member of the UChicago team, I served as an undergrad advisor and helped plan the project, getting funding and troubleshooting.

My name is Yun Xue. I'm the leader of team WHU-CHINA 2015.  And I participate in iGEM again, it is a precious opportunity for me to do research on our favorite themes with my teammates. My future plans include medical school and potential MD/PhD programs. To continue research in the future, I think it is necessary to turn my eyes not only to China but also to the world. I look forward to interchanging with students from foreign countries through iGEM.
Jack Blake, a silent boy who swims in the world of codes like a fish, dreams that one day he can make someone. Meanwhile, he is trying to jump out of one type of dogs named by Chinese students. See, life is full of surprise and I want this team to getwhat he desires because he puts too much heart in this game. Best Wishes.
I'm Jing-cheng Wang from College of Lifesciences in Wuhan University. Participating in iGEM is most exciting and fascinating to me, and I’ve learned a lot through the days. I have interest in various fields, such as music, computer sciences, badminton, etc. You can reach me through jcwang95@qq.com.

I'm Teng Li, the only one who comes from medical college of wuhan university, while I have great passion in synthetic biology and iGEM. I took part in the 2014 iGEM competition as a member from WHU-China, during which was primarily responsible for part of the experiment. This year I do the management with Yun Xue, the leader of our team. Apart from that, I'm in charge of human practice and communication with other teams. Different roles in my two years spent in iGEM taught me totally different things, and I enjoy every detail of that. I like growing up with friends, good luck to every iGEMers!
My name is Dong Han. I have been studying in Wuhan University for more than 3 years, majoring in biology. I was born in a coastal city named Qingdao, where I grew up with the sea, thus I like seafood, beach and sea breeze. Sea makes me open-minded, willing and have broad interests like swimming. I also enjoy reading and especially drawing, and so I am the main graphic designer in our team. I believe that painting will help people to learn the world better by watching it carefully, and it is the same with biology. That is why I join the team and I want to show our idea with my pen.
An Yunyun will be a senior student next semester. She takes notes of everything important of WHU-iGEM during the match, and enjoys it very much. What's more, she is good at plant biology.

Shouya Feng
A freshman who dove straight into iGEM team during the first year of college with limited knowledge in synthetic biology experiments I can now handle the molecular cloning. It's huge progress for me! Outside lab I take delight in reading ancient Greece myth as well as running.
Yujie Liu is our youngest team member,and she's studying Biotechnology in her 2rd year.She's one of the main members of our team,she paticipates in constructing our main kit.She designed and cloned huge parts of the light-sensing part,also,she takes an active part in our human practice.Out side the lab she enjoys running,learning new things from different career like economy and art,and she's really a friendly person.
I am MuTianchen and I am a junior student in the school of life science. Glad to meet everyone in this specific way. In iGEM, my job was to construct part of the Dental caries prevention circuit and help with the human practice. The work was heavy but also full of fun and inspiration. Me myself is a huge Sci-Fi buff and a fan of Coldplay——so for me the most interesting and relaxing activity outside the lab would be listening to the Violet Hill while traveling in the TARDIS … May the force be with you and enjoy the iGEM!

Hello, I'm Sheng Li, a sophomore student at Wuhan University. I am interested in many things like sports, music, and science. I'm so proud to join WHU-China iGEM team and be a iGEMer. This is surely a good experience for me. By the way, I am a part of the wiki builders, hope you like our wike(^_^).
I am Yiran Shen, studying for my bachelor degree, as a number of the 2015 iGEM team at Wuhan University I am so exciting because I did a lot of new things and meet with lots of new friends here. At first, I interested in the dental caries, so with my team member we considered different ways to control and even cure the disease. Then I also worked with other to organize the human practice and also asked for the sponsors. During these process, I find myself not only a simply experimenter, but also a creative participant trying various things. I am the people who have curiosity about everything and have the mania in biology studying, the experience in iGEM team is memorable, I love the feeling discussing with other about both the experiments and activities. During my free time, I like watching anime and playing online games.
Jin Xiang
Jin—the designer. She was the designer of the whole project gathering information from all subprojects and therefore responsible for designing poster and others promotional materials. In the process of participating in the project she learned a lot. When you listen closer, you will get blown away by her extraordinary mind.

About me:  Just for fun to join the WHU-iGEM at the beginning, I have never imaged to receive so much surprise in the iGEM family. Too much shock and touch, it seems no word can be used to express my passion and love to my team. It is my first year in iGEM, being a member in the MODEL group, the duty of which is to analyze the results from the biological group. This time,  my task is to simulate the 'Critical induction system' by certain model. A challenging task, like a wonderful experience, always makes me exited. Going ahead! I am looking forward to seeing a new word bring from this iGEM trip. Jin Xiang Jin—the designer. She was the designer of the whole project gathering information from all subprojects and therefore responsible for designing poster and others promotional materials. In the process of participating in the project she learned a lot. When you listen closer, you will get blown away by her extraordinary mind.
I'm Fei Xiong and I'm a 3rd year student of College of Life Sciences, Wuhan University. I like dancing and reading. It's my first time to join in iGEM WHU-CHINA team. I became interested in synthetic biology and chose to be an igemer because my roommate was in the team last year and we talk a lot about the iGEM. It's my honor to join such an interesting and challenging project and work with my energetic and creative teammates.

My name is Yun Xue. I’m the leader of team WHU-CHINA 2015.  And I participate in iGEM again, it is a precious opportunity for me to do research on our favorite themes with my teammates. My future plans include medical school and potential MD/PhD programs. To continue research in the future, I think it is necessary to turn my eyes not only to China but also to the world. I look forward to interchanging with students from foreign countries through iGEM.
Jack Blake, a silent boy who swims in the world of codes like a fish,dreams that one day he can make someone.Meanwhile,he is trying to jump out of one type of dogs named by Chinese students.See, life is full of surprise and I want this team to getwhat he desires because he puts too much heart in this game. Best Wishes.
I’m Jing-cheng Wang from College of Lifesciences in Wuhan University. Participating in iGEM is most exciting and fascinating to me, and I’ve learned a lot through the days. I have interest in various fields, such as music, computer sciences, badminton, etc. You can reach me through jcwang95@qq.com.

I’m Teng Li, the only one who comes from medical college of wuhan university, while I have great passion in synthetic biology and iGEM. I took part in the 2014 iGEM competition as a member from WHU-China, during which was primarily responsible for part of the experiment. This year I do the management with Yun Xue, the leader of our team. Apart from that, I’m in charge of human practice and communication with other teams. Different roles in my two years spent in iGEM taught me totally different things, and I enjoy every detail of that. I like growing up with friends, good luck to every iGEMers!
My name is Dong Han. I have been studying in Wuhan University for more than 3 years, majoring in biology. I was born in a coastal city named Qingdao, where I grew up with the sea, thus I like seafood, beach and sea breeze. Sea makes me open-minded, willing and have broad interests like swimming. I also enjoy reading and especially drawing, and so I am the main graphic designer in our team. I believe that painting will help people to learn the world better by watching it carefully, and it is the same with biology. That is why I join the team and I want to show our idea with my pen.
An Yunyun will be a senior student next semester. She takes notes of everything important of WHU-iGEM during the match, and enjoys it very much. What's more, she is good at plant biology.

I’m Yuanyuan Bie, a freshman majoring in biology. I love doing experiment since I was in junior high school. Also, I love biology, especially in molecular biology and microbiology. So I join in the iGEM. It provide me with a fantastic environment to do what I want. I really enjoy the atmosphere when we are doing experiments and discussing our project. It’s very lucky for me to be a member of 2015-WHU-CHINA. And it’s very lucky for me to get together with all the teammates. 2015-WHU-CHINA, we will do our best for it.
I am a person who cherishes every chance to broaden his horizon, communicate with and learn from others. As a freshman, I’m grateful to the opportunity that iGEM provides to learn about doing a project. Therefore, I strive to participate in most sections of our project and do my best. I enjoy brainstorming with a crowd of people and having new ideas rolling in my mind. Thanks for WHU-CHINA iGEM 2015, I have been set free in mind and therefore learnt a lot.
My name is Yongzhen Hei. I am a member of Wuhan University iGEM team.

A freshman who dove straight into iGEM team during the first year of college with limited knowledge in synthetic biology experiments I can now handle the molecular cloning. It's huge progress for me! Outside lab I take delight in reading ancient Greece myth as well as running.
Yujie Liu is our youngest team member,and she’s studying Biotechnology in her 2rd year.She’s one of the main members of our team,she paticipates in constructing our main kit.She designed and cloned huge parts of the light-sensing part,also,she takes an active part in our human practice.Out side the lab she enjoys running,learning new things from different career like economy and art,and she’s really a friendly person.
I am MuTianchen and I am a junior student in the school of life science. Glad to meet everyone in this specific way. In iGEM, my job was to construct part of the Dental caries prevention circuit and help with the human practice . The work was heavy but also full of fun and inspiration. Me myself is a huge Sci-Fi buff and a fan of Coldplay——so for me the most interesting and relaxing activity outside the lab would be listening to the Violet Hill while traveling in the TARDIS … May the force be with you and enjoy the iGEM!

Hello, I'm Sheng Li, a sophomore student at Wuhan University. I am interested in many things like sports, music, and science. I'm so proud to join WHU-China iGEM team and be a iGEMer. This is surely a good experience for me. By the way, I am a part of the wiki builders, hope you like our wike(^_^).
I am Yiran Shen, studying for my bachelor degree, as a number of the 2015 iGEM team at Wuhan University I am so exciting because I did a lot of new things and meet with lots of new friends here. At first, I interested in the dental caries, so with my team member we considered different ways to control and even cure the disease. Then I also worked with other to organize the human practice and also asked for the sponsors. During these process, I find myself not only a simply experimenter, but also a creative participant trying various things. I am the people who have curiosity about everything and have the mania in biology studying, the experience in iGEM team is memorable, I love the feeling discussing with other about both the experiments and activities. During my free time, I like watching anime and playing online games.

Ben Wilson
Course: 3rd Year Biochemist
About me: Project Leader and Founder
Marlena Mucha
Course: 3rd Year Human Genetics
About me: Until the age of 18 I wanted to be a forensic pathologist, but suddenly decided to become a geneticist instead and moved from my hometown (Krakow) to Ireland. Best decision I’ve ever made! I’ve been crowned the queen of dad jokes and puns.  In  the  Giant  Jamboree  you’ll  recognize  me easily  –  look  for  the  “I’m  plotting  something evil”/expressionless face and floral/geometric prints.
Why iGEM? I joined iGEM because as a future “human geneticist”, working in a lab with fellow students and developing a new way of producing an antimalarial drug seemed like an amazing opportunity to gain experience and evolve as a scientist. And indeed, it was.  I was mainly involved in the Interlab Study, which will make next year labs at college much easier  (hopefully),  and  it has  also  evoked  my inner  artist  by  my work  on  illustrations  for  our website.
Arnas Petrauskas
Course: 3rd year Human Genetics
About me: I hope to pursue a career in academic research within the field of genetics. I have been known to be the most punctual member of the team, my lunch breaks being exactly 10 minutes long.
Why iGEM? I enjoyed the project as it gave me a chance to work independently from the course curriculum and not be confined by the agendas of teaching labs. Learned many protocols and much technical information regarding lab techniques; became better at designing protocols and solving experimental problems. Improved digital design abilities.
Remsha Afzal
Course: 3rd Year Human Genetics
About me: I knew I wanted to be a scientist since the tender age of 3 when I would conduct ‘experiments’ on my sister- most of them wouldn’t go as planned. No worries, my sister is still alive! I was made the PR of our iGEM group and I’ve been the master of hashtags on Twitter ever since.
Why iGEM? I was very keen to get any hands-on experience working in a lab with proficient supervisors, who could help instil in me the skills required to be a competent geneticist. It was the perfect opportunity for me to broaden my horizons in Science and work with conscientious individuals. The iGEM experience proved to be one-of-a-kind where I not only had the chance to hone my skills but also had a lot of fun with friends.
Dáire Gannon
Course: 2nd year Human Genetics
About me: I spent half my summer directing and editing tutorial videos for iGEM Academy. I then immersed myself in wet lab work, applying the lab techniques I had learned in the making of the videos. The challenge of turning the concept of a more affordable antimalarial drug into a reality was a major motivation as were the words of Kathleen Monroe, Executive Director of Zagaya,‘ Malaria doesn’t need to exist, it just doesn’t. So we just need to eliminate it.’ I hope that the work of this year’s team will act as a benchmark for future Trinity College Dublin teams to excel in the iGEM competition. Ní neart go cur le chéile
Why iGEM? My confidence and competency in the lab grew exponentially as the project progressed. I enjoyed the hands on problem solving demanded in the design and implementation of experiments.
Zaneta Najda
Course: 3rd Year Human Genetics
About me: I'm originally from Poland but I've been living in Ireland since I was 12. It was in Ireland that, at the age of 16, I discovered my fascination and love for genetics; I haven't wanted to do anything else since! The opportunity to get involved in iGEM was one that I couldn't allow to pass me by. The work we carried out throughout our project definitely helped me become a more skilled and experienced scientist. When I win my first Nobel Prize, I'll make sure to mention that it all started with iGEM 2015!
Why iGEM? Working in the lab during iGEM helped me become more confident in the environment and helped me perfect the laboratory skills I already had. In addition to this, I also learned many lab techniques that are very important in synthetic biology but that I had never gotten the chance to use before; these include: preparing minipreps, digestions, ligations and transformations and, running gel electrophoresis. iGEM provided me with a bigger picture of the possibilities in the fields of synthetic biology and genetics. I was very involved in the wet lab but also enjoyed interacting with other iGEM teams to achieve collaboration and reaching out to the general public to explain our experiment's goal. I also had to face one of my biggest fears: giving a speech!
Anya Aleshko
Course: 4th year Biochemistry
About me: Although I’m originally from Belarus I’ve been living in Ireland now for 13 years. My hands are the stars of our series of iGEM Academy videos ‘A Beginner’s Guide’. I have a passion for rifles and an in depth knowledge of all the pubs of Dublin.
Why iGEM? I joined iGEM team because it offered a chance to be involved in something different and something that wouldn’t have been just another internship. Personally I found that taking part in iGEM has been a rewarding learning experience.
Team Instructors
Matthew Carrigan
About me: I'm a postdoc at Trinity College Dublin. My main focus is on using next-generation sequencing to diagnose inherited and infectious diseases. I'm not sure what cosmic irony led a bioinformatician who hasn't handled a pipette in months to mentor a team doing a wet-lab project, but it all worked out in the end.
Killian Hanlon
About me: I’m a PhD student in Trinity College Dublin, working on developing gene therapies for inherited eye disease. Despite this, my career in science didn’t exactly start off well. A few months into my final year research, I may have accidentally started a…small fire on my lab bench. Look at me now!"

The iRIf device (built within the projects Proteintranslator FKZ 7533-7-11.6.3) and the knowledge of using it, as well as the techniques and devices for creating PDMS flow chambers (supported by the research from the EU project CE microarray funding number 606618) were kindly provided by AG Roth.
We thank Biametrics for the allowance to use their iRIf devices (built initially in the EU funded project SystemCerv grant number 306037) in Freiburg and for their personal training and discussion on site in Tübingen.
Chloroalkane compounds capable to bind a HaloTag onto surfaces were received by Prof. Wiesmüller, Tübingen, Germany.
From Prof. Piehler and his group, Osnabrück, Germany we obtained Ni-NTA coated iRIf slides for comparison to our Ni-NTA slides, as well as the polymer PLL-PEG-HTL that is capable to bind a HaloTag.
Based on protocols by Shinjiro Tachibana 1) and the National University of Singapore we developed Ni-NTA surfaces which were used for conducting our experiments.
Our cell-free expression system was established by ourselves based on protocols from Dr. Frank Bernhard, Frankfurt, Germany and the EMBL, Heidelberg, Germany.
Prof. Dr. S. Dübel of the University of Braunschweig provided us with expression vectors for a Salmonella Typhimurium antigen ( pRIG15_15 ) and a corresponding single chain variable fragment ( pRIG15_13 ) .
Acknowledgements
The iGEM Team Freiburg acknowledges the generosity of the BIOSS - Centre for Biological Signalling Studies - for its financial support and for providing both a laboratory and great equipment. We would also like to thank our team leaders and advisors and the AG Roth from the ZBSA - Center for Biological Systems Analysis - who helped us realize our project by giving us advice, material and sharing their experiences.
BIOSS administration and Toolbox
Founded in 2008, BIOSS is an excellence cluster of the University of Freiburg focusing on signalling research and promoting a dialectic process between scientists using analytical and synthetic approaches. The interdisciplinary team of researchers is supported by the resource, storage, and information centre for biological materials, called Toolbox, which also provided us with professional advice, plasmids, cell lines, and antibodies. Therefore, we would like to thank the BIOSS, namely Dr. Nicole Gensch, for her great support for our project to all intents and Dr. Pavel Salavei for supporting us with tips and advices concerning protein expression and purification.

This been my second time participating in the iGem competition I am a 17-year-old student in fifth semester of junior high. Having the Japanese and Mexican Nationalities is what makes me unique. I am as an Asian has to be “naturally” (such a stereotype -_-) interested in science and technology, but besides that I am a really open minded and a happy person. That’s why I have the best of both sides of Mexico and Japan. I was really interested in the competition because I could learn more about a topic that I am passionate about and to experience such an international and intercultural event will make my world bigger than the really one. This year been the president of the team gave me an irreplaceable opportunity which opened my eyes and realize how difficult is to accomplish something, but not impossible.

I am 17 years old. I'm from Mexico City. I am currently in fifth semester of junior high at Tecnológico de Monterrey CCM. I've always been interested in issues directly related to design, image view and manual techniques. I have participated in my school groups contributing to the area of design and display, as well as in projects and logo contests  and images of representation.I'm in GenetiX, first because I love to contribute to the group with what I know related to design, also because I want to relate that, with the rest of the group to form a complete team and we'll structured in each of their areas. As well as learn not only in the areas in which each of ones are involved, I mean to learn as much chemistry, marketing, programming, research and very important area, where you involve human resources in which you involve values and the human practice within each of us with the help of all the members of our team.I like iGEM because it is a foundation that promotes beyond coexistence with our own equipment, to give everything to be the best, promotes the relationship between more teams involved in iGEM with the support of a feedback and learning by what you acquire here. Likewise iGEM urges teens to have a deep knowledge in science with the help of many other areas that complement each of the teams.

I am 17 years old and I am an enthusiast of any Chemistry and Biology groups or projects. I am I GenetiX because I wanted to use my knowledge of my two favourite subjects in a project that could really change something for the people. Also languages are a hobby for me, I know Spanish, English, French, German, Arabic and I want to learn Japanese. I like iGEM because it involves many people from many countries that gather for one simple goal, making the world a better place. iGEM is the first step for me to make a change for the environment we all live in.

The reason I joined GenetiX is because I want to learn more about these subjects, and because I think it is a great opportunity to apply theoretical knowledge to real-life problems.  In iGEM, I find a great chance to experience the interaction between teams and to prove what GenetiX is capable of.

I am 17 years old and I’m currently studying third semester at Tecnologico de Monterrey. Science, is something that have always deeply interest me, because it answers the most amazing and vital questions: from the tiniest subparticle, to the most titanic supernova. But what truly interest me within it, is the great potential that we have thrue science to change the world for better. The things that we have accomplished as a scientific community are just terrifically unbelievable and to think what we can accomplish in a few years, just thrills me. I think that both GenetiX and iGem are a great opportunity to start that change. Also, I participate in Models of United Nations (MUNs) I had been in over seven muns in the past three years both as delegate and as chair. My most beloved hobby is parliamentary debate, I I was primary founder of the Debate Club in Tecnologico de Monterrey and we are going to participate next November on “Panamericanos”. Everything that I do is focused on achieving that change, because I want that every time someone mentions the word “future” they don’t think about a mass of gray polluted injustice, but as a bright community full of opportunities and hope.

I describe myself as a very creative, social and smart person. I am in Genetix because it is a group made for science and also have social activities to share and spread science. Its a place where I can be myself, and apport to share my knowledge to others. Also is a way to be in IGem, and develop my abilities to my future, due to the fact that I want to study biochemistry. This development is also useful to my school work. My future aspirations are to work on the scientific field and help the society by this way.

I am a 17 year old student cursing 3rd semester of high school at Tecnologico de Monterrey, Campus Ciudad de Mexico. The reason I joined GenetiX and iGem is because I’ve always been deeply fascinated with sciences, and the thought of being able to get involved in such an experience was enthralling and exciting. I find iGem to be a real challenge, as I like how the project is taken beyond the lab and always asks for a multidisciplinary effort to succeed. Overall, I think of this as a great opportunity to learn more about science, get involved more in the things I am the most passionate about, and start building up a path to fulfill my dream of studying and eventually researching in an area related to science.

I am 17 year old student coursing fifth semester of high school at Tecnologico de Monterrey, Campus Ciudad de Mexico. The main reason I decided to become a member of Genetix was my love and interest for biology and related sciences. I really like the way that Genetix chose not only to focus on biological sciences, but become a multidisciplinary group that searches to help society and spread an overall awareness of science. In addition, I love the way that we can go further from our classes, and investigate on our own, gaining knowledge that can help in our future (given we study sciences later on) and becoming independent in the process. Finally, I love the fact that all members of the team are decided to help and improve  Genetix as a whole.

I am a 17 year old student at Tecnológico de Monterrey, Campus Ciudad de México. I am interested mainly in biological sciences and that is the main reason I chose to be in GenetiX. I really love this area of science and I believe iGem offers an amazingly wide range of experience to enjoy and learn from. Learning everyday not only from the project itself, but mostly from other team members has been one of the best rewards this experience has given me. I believe it is amazing how we are able to mix the practice of science with everything else the industry should involve at such a young age. We manage the project, as well as finances and important events. I especially appreciate those that allow contact with other people to inspire the great love and interest for science our team shares. GenetiX and iGem have given me great knowledge and experience, as well as a profound interest on our topic and the people involved.

Human Practises
I'm 17 years old, and I'm currently studying my third semester in Tecnológico de Monterrey, Mexico City Campus. I recently joined the Human Practices team in GenetiX because since middle school I have been very interested in chemistry and biology, it amazes me to study how we and everything that surrounds us behaves; plus I get to learn very interesting stuff, interact with many people and help others. But what I like most about GenetiX and the other iGem groups is that they actually do something, they make sure their projects are heard of, and change for good the world we live in. Often we hear how we are destroying our world, but come to think about how many people try to change that; that's why I think iGem and GenetiX are such a good opportunity, not just for us, but for all the people who want to improve things.
Rodrigo Velázquez
I'm 17 years old. I was born and raised in Mexico City, where I started to develop my passion for sports, mostly for soccer and football and I've been able to play football for my high school for two years now. Another one of my passions is technology and my curiosity to learn more in this area is what made me want to join Genetix. I'm one of the developers of our wiki and webpage and I plan to keep learning more about technology and science for many years. Genetix has really helped me to develop skills in computer science and has made me even more curious than how I was at the very beginning, I know that this group will keep growing bigger and bigger so future generations on our high school can learn all of what we've learned on the team and even make an impact in the world.

I was one of those kids doesn’t knowing what to expect and want from their life, but with the passing of the years I found a way into science and technology, I’m mainly interested in computer science, robotics and physics, but also liking to acquire and understand other areas like biology and chemistry. The main reasons I choose to join Genetix and iGem was to find a way to help others with my work and the possibility and to make other feel the way I do about science. This team has let me be part of something that can help our society, but it has taught me many things too, like teamwork and responsibility, letting me meet incredible people .  I’m sure all the information and abilities that I obtain here will help me in the future studying a career and fulfill my desire to create something that will create a change in society.

Why fit in when you were made to stand out?” I am sure there is no better description of me than these Dr. Seuss' words. I am an 18-year old senior, who is passionate about life. Growing up, I have always been a very hyperactive girl: fond of music, people and science. I love dancing, singing, meeting new people and places, and of course learning how and why things work. This peculiar mashup has led me to learn invaluable lessons. I guess my biggest goal is to make the difference, create the change I have always looked for. Fortunately, I have found the opportunity to achieve it through GenetiX and iGEM: I believe science is what can turn things up. I’ve studied at Tecnológico de Monterrey (Campus Ciudad de México) for almost three years now and I already think of it as my second home. Naturally, GenetiX has become my second family. My teammates have taught me far more than just science or teamwork. From them I have learnt the value of passion, dedication, responsibility and enthusiasm. I have enjoyed that science is not only about lab discoveries, but about what you do with them. This has been an extraordinary experience; one that is just beginning.

""Be everything you can, being yourself"" I’m an 18 year old student coursing fifth semester of high school at Tecnológico de Monterrey Campus Ciudad de México. My main objective in life is to enjoy every aspect of it, therefore I’ve been part of different activities of various areas. My main love in life are sports, I’ve been playing soccer since I can remember but I also love arts and science. I joined GenetiX because I saw an opportunity to apply my knowledge in Computer Science, a class I’ve been taking in the IB program. With time, I was surprised with all the projects of the group and the activities we’ve done. I glad to be part of this family, to share my knowledge and work with people that share my passions.

Since I was a little girl, I have always adored to decorate everything until it reached my expected image of perfection and additionally, I am a natural curiouser. Those aptitudes eventually evolved into an ability that helped me to learn by myself how to use different tools and programs to create beautiful designs. I believe Genetix and iGem are a great opportunity to comvergent two of the things I love the most; design and science.

In today’s modern world, greenhouse gases such as NOx and SOx pose a major global issue that needs to be addressed. These oxides also increase the oxidizing capacity of the atmosphere which are responsible for the photochemical production of ozone in the lower layers of the atmosphere which has detrimental effects. Sulfur Oxides (SOx) are the main precursors of air pollution which is a deteriorating problem as well. Producing acid rain and acidified soils, Sulfur Oxides not only result in respiratory problems such as asthma and pneumonia, but also destroy farm crops, buildings and environment, causing loss of millions of dollars every year.

Our Story
""iGEM IIT Delhi"" is a dedicated lot of students, who have this unquenching thirst for Synthetic Biology. The team, comprising of students from various disciplines, is mentored by the highly experienced research associates and faculty of our college. It is this ""Never Give Up!"" attitude which proves to be the strongest similarity among each of us. We have worked in a committed manner, with the best of our efforts. But hey, it was not just about the work! We guys did enjoy the time spent together. This summer of 2015 will certainly be the best part in our album of life.
Mentors
Manisha Lamba
PhD, Department of Biochemical Engineering and Biotechnology.
I am a PhD scholar at Department of Biochemical Engineering and Biotechnology. I am passionate about learning new things. For me working with iGEM was a great learning and teaching experience. I was always there to provide guidance and assistance to the team whenever required.
Omkar Vinchure
Phd, Department of Biochemical Engineering and Biotechnology.
The sole purpose of obtaining knowledge is to be able to spread it and use it for the betterment of the society. According to me, iGEM has provided the platform for just that- there's no greater joy than watching the things that we learn and execute fall into place.
Varsha Ashok Walvekar
MS (Research), Department of Biochemical Engineering and Biotechnology.
""Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful committed citizens can change the world; indeed, it's the only thing that ever has."" - Margaret Mead. I'm a firm believer of putting on small efforts and tilting the odds for making changes. I'm someone who is extremely tenacious and devoted. Once I've defined my benchmarks, I take necessary steps to achieve those milestones.
Shuddhodana Mukta
Final year master's student majoring in Biochemical Engineering.
I've known iGEM since my undergrad days, as a synthetic biology enthusiast with an inclination towards metabolic engineering, I always wanted to be a part of an iGEM team. As soon as I learnt about iGEM team at IIT Delhi, I decided to be part of it.
Responsibilities: Lab, strategy making for experimentation and execution, troubleshooting.
TEAM
Chandel Angad Singh
Fifth Year Undergraduate, Department of Biochemical Engineering and Biotechnology.
The basic motivation for me be a part of iGEM is that here we can work the way we want. From designing the strategies to encountering every single problem which comes in our way, it's all us. We have the liberty to work on our own and that's the most important part of the team. The actors become famous by the movie they act in, while it’s the director who makes the movie famous! I am the director in this case.
Nikhil Patidar
Fourth year Undergraduate, Department of Biochemical Engineering and Biotechnology.
Initially, I was involved in introducing new faces with lab basics and later on carried on with creative team as thought provider. Pioneered in conceptualizing the wiki, tour, poster, banner and presentation.
Arpit Dhupar
Mechanical E8ngineering Graduate, working in FITT.
I am highly passionate for clean energy solutions. This passion became the driving factor for getting involved with the project of Igem-Iitd.
I took the responsibility of designing and developing proof of concept prototype that could work in conjunction with bacteria designed by team and explore future possibilities of scaling up the model.
Kshitij Rai
Third Year Undergraduate, Department of Biochemical Engineering and Biotechnology.
I could put up a sentimental quote here that expresses my love for synthetic biology. But that's something I can't put into words. The only reason I joined iGEM was this passion to do something, to work on biological system that can bring about a difference, to do synthetic biology. Life is simple.. Eat, Sleep, Clone and Repeat.
Aniruddh Yadav
Third Year Undergraduate, Department of Biochemical Engineering and Biotechnology.
""A dream doesn't become reality through magic; it takes sweat, determination and hard work."" - Colin Powell. I started off working with the Lab part of the team with the aim to learn as much as I could about Lab work relating to synthetic biology. I've always had the dream to pursue my further studies in the field of biology, and iGEM has helped me immensely in gaining a lot of experience.
Shreya Pal
Third Year Undergraduate, Department of Biochemical Engineering and Biotechnology.
I joined iGEM due to my interest in molecular and synthetic biology. I've loved doing the lab and modelling work. iGEM has given me a small glimpse of what the future holds for us and what a revolutionary field I'm working in.

I worked in the Human Practice team and went for some of the surveys and site visits.It was great fun working with the team and I did learn lots of stuff!
Shashank Garg
Second Year Undergraduate, Department of Biochemical Engineering and Biotechnology.
I am the kind of boy who wants to explore things. And for me, the best part was the fun which we had in all these days. Literally speaking, I lived these days. And regarding my involvement, I worked in Prototype Designing. I was actively involved in Human Practices and did put a decent amount of effort in managing stuffs.
Souhardya Roy
Second Year Undergraduate, Chemical Engineering.
I dream a lot. And I work hard to make them true. That's me.
Here at iGEM, I worked in the Lab team and tried my hands at modelling. Towards the end, I was involved in developing the content and a bit of designing the wiki.
Vinay Kamuju
Second Year Undergraduate, Department of Biochemical Engineering and Biotechnology.
Being a part of iGEM, I got an amazing exposure in the field of Synthetic Biology. It was fun working with such an amazing team, and I did have a lot of things to try my hands at. I worked in the lab team, basically dealing with the troubleshoot part. Also, I was actively involved in the modelling team and in Human Practices as well.
Shubham Goel
Second Year Undergraduate, Department of Biochemical Engineering and Biotechnology.
iGEM was the perfect platform for me to gain an handsome exposure in Synthetic Biology. I worked a little in the marketing team and helped with some of the Human Practice related works. It was fun working with the team.
Prakhar Agrawal
Second Year Undergraduate, Computer Science and Engineering.
I work in the web development team of the club.
I like learning new things!
Yatish Aggarwal
Third Year Undergraduate, Department of Biochemical Engineering and Biotechnology.
I like doing creative things and iGEM provided me an awesome opportunity. I mainly worked in the Creative and Designing team.
Aparana Gupta
Second Year Undergraduate, Chemical Engineering.
I love working for society and towards its welfare.
I handle the the web part of the club.
Sociologist
Mahendra Shahare
Science and technology studies (STS) scholar, and doctoral candidate at the department of humanities and social sciences IIT Delhi.
I am exploring the emergence of synthetic biology in India, and it was a great honour that iGEM IIT Delhi team invited and welcomed me. As a sociologist of science, it had been a great learning experience for me to observe the way a group of young people took up this new mode of knowledge construction. Their passion, perseverance and never give up attitude - given the lack of resources they face - enriched my own work in multiple ways and proved out as an excellent site for a STS scholar.

Origin
In today’s modern world, greenhouse gases such as NOx and SOx pose a major global issue that needs to be addressed. These oxides also increase the oxidizing capacity of the atmosphere which are responsible for the photochemical production of ozone in the lower layers of the atmosphere which has detrimental effects. Sulfur Oxides (SOx) are the main precursors of air pollution which is a deteriorating problem as well. Producing acid rain and acidified soils, Sulfur Oxides not only result in respiratory problems such as asthma and pneumonia, but also destroy farm crops, buildings and environment, causing loss of millions of dollars every year.

Our Project
The Problem:
The world these days has turned into a junkyard of wastes. In today’s world, greenhouse gases such as NOx and SOx pose a global challenge to our sustainability which needs to be addressed on an immediate note.
Being greenhouse gases, both NOx and SOx have a good hand in Global Warming, the most challenging problem at these days. Considering the present rate of rise in temperature, the world’s certainly at the stake of destruction.
These oxides increase the oxidizing capacity of the atmosphere which is responsible for the photochemical production of ozone in the lower layers of the atmosphere which has detrimental effects.
SOx is the main precursor of air pollution which is a deteriorating problem for all of us.
Producing acid rain and acidified soils, Sulfur Oxides not only result in respiratory problems such as asthma and pneumonia, but also destroy farm crops, buildings and environment, causing huge economic losses every year.
Both NOx and SOx also have detrimental effects on the environment.
An Innovative Solution:
Our team, iGEM IIT Delhi, plans to combat this catastrophic effect using one of the most promising field of research, Synthetic Biology.
Firstly, we aimed to come up with a strain of engineered bacteria (using Synthetic Biology) which converts harmful components of an exhaust gases coming out of chimneys of various industries and car exhausts into harmless by-products. And as a matter of fact, we have been successful in achieving this far. However, we have given a parallel thought about improving the efficiency and durability of the bacteria and also about including further gases with harmful consequences to be reduced as well.
Secondly, we are aiming to build a working prototype using innovative techniques of mechanical and chemical engineering, thus giving an inter-disciplinary dimension to our project.
The reactor which we are designing can be used on a multi-purpose basis like :
Diesel Generator
Car Engine
Industrial Purposes
This done, all that remains is to incorporate our genetically engineered bacteria into the prototype which will give the final touch to our project and allow us to offer the world with a unique solution to address air pollution!

Meet Arashk Gasroddashti
Hi! My name is Arashk Ghasroddashti and I'm currently in my grade 11 year at the Lethbridge Collegiate Institute. I joined iGEM so that I could experience the amazing opportunities that synthetic biology has to offer, first hand. In addition, getting a chance to work with a team in all sorts of different environments (lab, planning meets, work groups, etc.) has been absolutely invaluable! I plan to eventually move onto university where I will study a field with a strong focus in biology and (hopefully), in the end become some sort of surgeon. Things I enjoy include Judo, computer work, business, movies and of course, learning about the sciences.
When I saw you, it was dopamine, oxytocin, and serotonin at first sight ;)

Meet HJ
Originally from Germany I moved to Canada in 2005 to start a research group on the structure and function of the bacterial protein synthesis machinery, a cellular process targeted by over 50% of the known antibiotics. I am intrigued by the molecular design and function of this essential bio-nanomachine. I try to unravel the underlying design principles in order to enable the rational design and engineering of novel bio-nanomachines. I am essentially asking the question if such novel bio-machines can be constructed from simple and fundamental principles or are these assemblies just to complex. Well and that’s why it was extremely easy to rope me into doing iGEM.
What did one sister chromatid say to the other? Stop copying me!

Meet Brian
I am a Structural Biochemist and new to Synthetic Biology and iGEM. I love the idea of being able to make whatever I want in the lab. Previously I have used NMR and X-ray crystallography to look at protein-protein interactions. My wife is a Biochemist also, which makes dinner conversation interesting (for us anyways).

Previous involvement: I founded the CU team in 2012.  Attended iGEM as a spectator at MIT from 2006-2008.
I've got degrees in computer engineering, genetics, computer science, and biomedical engineering.  So the teamwork, design, and innovation of iGEM is always fun.   I also enjoy working with undergraduates.
Marcelo Bassalo
Previous involvement: I was part of iGEM in 2009 as an undergrad student, being part of the first brazilian team to participate in this competition.
iGEM is a perfect introduction to the promising field of synthetic biology, with hundreds of creative ideas being exchanged in this fun competition.
Michael Brasino
Previous involvement: I have been an adviser to iGEM for the last two years and a iGEM student in the past at University of Washington.
I like iGEM because it allows students to move research in completely new directions.
Peter Otoupal
Previous involvement: In 2012 I helped revive iGEM at The University of Texas, Austin, where we engineered E. coli to be ""addicted"" to caffeine for survival.
iGEM is one of the best programs to introduce the next-generation of scientists to Synthetic Biology. By creating and pursuing their own projects, students in iGEM get a glimpse into what it research really entails.

BBa_K1718001:
RFP under arabinose inducible pBad
This part has a Red Fluorescent Protein (RFP) downstream of the pBad promoter. Expression is stimulated by L-arabinose. We used this part to test the leakiness of this promoter.
BBa_K1718002:
Genetic Switch for Bxb1 invertase
The Bxb1 invertase will invert the segment of DNA between the two recognition sites. In this case, Bxb1 will invert a terminator allowing for expression of a strong Anderson promoter.
BBa_K1718003:
RFP under the LuxPr promoter
In the presence of AHL, the LuxR transcription factor will bind AHL and activate the LuxPr promoter. RFP is downstream and will be expressed.
BBa_K1718004:
LuxI and GFP
LuxI leads to the production of AHL which, when in the presence of AHL, activates the LuxPr promoter. Downstream of the LuxI coding region is GFP, a reporter
BBa_K1718006:
Genetic switch for Bxb1 with LuxI and GFP
This part consists of the genetic switch described in BBa_K1718002 and the LuxI and GFP coding regions described in BBa_K1718004

Undergraduate Team Members
David Brenes
Without him, it would just be GEM. Apple, if you call us on trademark infringement, contact him.
Kimberline Chew
Anthony (TJ) Ciesla
Fearless leader. Makes 90% of team mistakes.
Adarsh Ettyreddy
Matt Farnitano
Jeremy Gonzales
Now, this is a story all about how
My life got flipped-turned upside down
And I'd like to take a minute
Just sit right there
I'll tell you how I became the prince of a club called iGEM.
In west Philadelphia born and raised
On the playground was where I spent most of my days
Chillin' out maxin' relaxin' all cool
And all shootin some b-ball outside of the school
When a couple of guys who were up to no good
Started making trouble in my neighborhood
I got in one little fight and my mom got scared
She said 'You're movin' with your auntie and uncle in iGEM’
Jeremy is a junior studying biomedical engineering and neuroscience.
Alvin Han
Alvin enjoys sulking in the mornings and shaking his fist at the concept of 8:30 AM classes. His happy place is the lab, and he finds a strange zen in doing MiniPreps and filling 96-well plates. His greatest pleasure is pipetting off all the supernatant without disturbing the pellet whatsoever. A sophomore intending to pursue biology and computer science, he prefers to spend his free time searching for wildlife on hikes or in a good documentary. He decided to join iGEM to broaden his knowledge of current synthetic biology techniques and DNA manipulation, but mostly because he enjoys toying with entire colonies of creatures which he could wipe out with his thumb.
Ben Hoover
Ben is the team middle schooler. Often mistaken for a 12 year old, he is fascinated by every object in biology lab that moves or blinks or makes funny noises. Sometimes he even tries to replicate said noises or harmonize with the spinning of the centrifuge. Some say he is a junior in college. He doesn’t believe them. Some say he’s on track for a Biomedical Engineering degree. But tracks can split and change directions and merge. If you’re really unlucky you might hit a break in the tracks and find yourself derailed. Meh. He is more likely to be found lying on the tracks and looking at the stars.
Sarah Jacobs
Sarah is a sophomore majoring in biomedical engineering from Palo Alto, California. When she isn’t in the lab, she enjoys cooking, listening to Taylor Switft, and working as an EMT for Duke EMS.
Joe Kreitz
An exceedingly good kid.
Parth Patel
Seasoned veteran. Wild card. High school “outreach.”
Adam Yaseen
Does he even go here?
Advisors
Nick Buchler
Nick really likes oscillators, such as the cell cycle, metabolic rhythms, circadian clocks, and synthetic oscillators. Folks in his lab use a combination of synthetic biology, time lapse microscopy, microfluidics, comparative genomics, mathematical modelling, and molecular genetics to understand biological oscillation. When he's not in lab, he's at home on five acres in the Duke forest with his family. The summer fireflies are very satisfying to watch.
Charles Gersbach
Dr. Charles A. Gersbach is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Biomedical Engineering and Center for Genomic and Computational Biology at Duke University. He has research interests in gene therapy, regenerative medicine, biomolecular and cellular engineering, synthetic biology, and genomics. Dr. Gersbach received his Bachelor's degree in Chemical Engineering from the Georgia Institute of Technology and Ph.D. in Biomedical Engineering from the Georgia Institute of Technology and Emory University School of Medicine focusing on the genetic reprogramming of adult stem cells for musculoskeletal tissue regeneration. Dr. Gersbach completed his postdoctoral training at the Scripps Research Institute in molecular biology and biochemistry. Dr. Gersbach's laboratory at Duke University is focused on applying molecular and cellular engineering to applications in gene therapy, regenerative medicine, and basic science. Examples of technologies used in his research include genome engineering and protein engineering.
Mike Lynch
Dr. Mike Lynch is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Biomedical Engineering and the Department of Chemistry, and is a Faculty Fellow in The Energy Initiative.  He has research interests in genetically engineering microbes to shut off their growth circuits and turn on new pathways to produce different compounds.  By focusing their energy, he seeks to improve production of biofuels, pharmacological molecules, and industrial chemicals.
Lingchong You
Dr. You is an Associate Professor of Biomedical Engineering and a Paul Ruffin Scarborough Associate Professor of Engineering.  Dr. You's research interest focus on computational systems biology & synthetic biology, including mathematical modeling of cellular networks; mechanisms of information processing by gene networks; design, modeling and construction of robust gene networks for applications in engineering and medicine."

Attributions
Each team must clearly attribute work done by the student team members on this page. The team must distinguish work done by the students from work done by others, including the host labs, advisors, instructors, and individuals not on the team roster.
Can we base our project on a previous one?
Yes! You can have a project based on a previous team, or based on someone else's idea, as long as you state this fact very clearly and give credit for the original project.
Why is this page needed?
The Attribution requirement helps the judges know what you did yourselves and what you had help with. We don't mind if you get help with difficult or complex techniques, but you must report what work your team did and what work was done by others.
For example, you might choose to work with an animal model during your project. Working with animals requires getting a license and applying far in advance to conduct certain experiments in many countries. This is difficult to achieve during the course of a summer, but much easier if you can work with a postdoc or PI who has the right licenses.

The Students:
Jake Palumbo
Jake is wrapping up his final year at Pacific University. He is majoring in bioinformatics, and looking forward to pursuing systems and computational biology in graduate school. From early childhood, Jake has expressed direct interest in genetic and metabolic engineering. His obsession with swarm behavior and the ""squishy dynamics"" of the natural world has furthered him down this path. He is incredibly excited to participate in iGEM 2015, especially as the leader of the first team out of his home state of Oregon.""
Mike Ashley
Mike is a junior at Pacific University majoring in business finance. He is beyond excited for the market potential of Sclerotite."

Team Introduction
We are a group of enthusiastic and persistent Chinese students from Nanjing University. We started our iGEM tour as sophomores and seniors in 2014. At first, most of us were unfamiliar with synthetic biology and relevant experimental skills in molecular biology. However, we made the resolution to face this challenging but rewarding course. Our team consists of students from Life Science Department and College of Engineering and Applied Sciences. The interdisciplinary team has made it possible to fully realize our vision due to a variety of special skills we harbor. We have tried to make the most of everyone’s strengths when assigning tasks, yet each team member still have the chance to keep learning something new. The iGEM competition is truly a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for us to get fully involved in scientific research, from coming up with a new idea, operating experiments to carrying out human practices, designing wiki and posters. During the past year, it has become our daily routine to meet up with each other, brainstorming to polish our project. What we have gained during this period of time is not only professional knowledge, but also enthusiasm for science and how to work as a team. Other than every incredible team member, we have also received amazing support from our advisors, instructors and sponsors.     Here comes our team profile.

Biosafety is the prevention of large-scale loss of biological integrity, focusing both on ecology and human health. These prevention mechanisms include conduction of regular reviews of the biosafety in laboratory settings, as well as strict guidelines to follow. Biosafety is used to protect us from harmful incidents. High security facilities are necessary when working with Synthetic Biology as there are possibilities of bioterrorism acts or release of harmful chemicals and or organisms into the environment. A complete understanding of experimental risks associated with synthetic biology is helping to enforce the knowledge and effectiveness of biosafety.
With the potential future creation of man-made unicellular organisms, some are beginning to consider the effect that these organisms will have on biomass already present. Scientists estimate that within the next few decades, organism design will be sophisticated enough to accomplish tasks such as creating biofuels and lowering the levels of harmful substances in the atmosphere. Scientist that favor the development of synthetic biology claim that the use of biosafety mechanisms such as suicide genes and nutrient dependencies will ensure the organisms cannot survive outside of the lab setting in which they were originally created. Organizations like the ETC Group argue that regulations should control the creation of organisms that could potentially harm existing life. They also argue that the development of these organisms will simply shift the consumption of petroleum to the utilization of biomass in order to create energy. These organisms can harm existing life by affecting the prey/predator food chain, reproduction between species, as well as competition against other species (species at risk, or act as an invasive species). Synthetic vaccines are now being produced in the lab. These have caused a lot of excitement in the pharmaceutical industry as they will be cheaper to produce, allow quicker production, as well enhance the knowledge of virology and immunology.

The Team
About Us
Our team originates from Consort – a rural Albertan village with a population of about 750 people. Despite being from a small town, we have taken on the challenge of creating an iGEM Team and the challenges of developing our very own biochemistry lab. Inside our high school science classroom we have designed BioBricks, taught ourselves lab protocols with the help of mentors, and most importantly we have taught our community about synthetic biology. As a team, we also believe that coming from a small rural community means the community involvement is amazingly close-knit, and we've brought new ideas and perspectives to iGEM that other city teams may not have brought before.
Please click on one of the following pictures to read a team member's or an advisor's bio.
Team Members
Alex Coulton
I'm a Grade 12 student at Consort School. My interest in science and the future of technology has always been an entertaining hobby because of its diversity, experimentation, and possibility to change society. My hobbies include carpentry, metalwork, gaming, experimenting and creating anything I can make a blueprint for. Although I don't know for sure what I want to do after high school I want to stay involved in the world of technology and science, hopefully continuing on with my crazy creating. After secondary school I hope to travel to New Zealand, Australia, and Europe for work so I can get to know the culture of another country and become a part of its community.
Austin Wiltse
Hi! My name is Austin, and I'm a Grade 12 student at Consort School. iGEM has opened my eyes to so many new horizons in the field of science, and allowed me to meet some amazing people I never would have otherwise. I play several different sports in my free time, such as curling and basketball. When I'm not playing sports or doing iGEM, you can find me playing video games or programming one I've made. After graduating, I plan on attending a computer programming course in college and eventually become a video game developer.
Catie Rossing
I am going into the Grade 11 here at Consort school. I joined iGEM because I enjoy science - mostly chemistry. I ended up really loving the lab work! The iGEM experience has helped me realize what I want to do after high school. After graduation I plan to attend college to become a medical laboratory technologist. Outside of iGEM I like to play basketball, badminton and I work for the local newspaper - The Consort Enterprise. I also love hanging out with friends and being outside. I like both listening to and playing music. I learned how to play guitar when I was around 10 years old and then taught myself how to play piano when I was 14. I like challenging myself to learn new songs.
Cole Sansregret
My name is Cole Sansregret. I am 16 years old and attend Consort School. I love to read and participate in archery, golf, gaming, curling, and basketball. I love making jokes and hanging out with my friends (and Austin. Sometimes.). This is my second year in iGEM, and I can't imagine doing a better activity!I originally joined iGEM because I wanted to learn more about the process of synthetic biology, and determine whether or not it is a viable option for my future career after high school. Now I continue because it is fun, and I can't imagine not doing it.
Nikayla Goddard
As a Grade 12 student, this is my second year involved with the iGEM Team. I joined iGEM not only to participate more in synthetic biology, but also to enhance my prospects after graduating high school – to be a journalist who is a conduit between scientist’s wordy reports and the common person’s ability to interpret scientific jargon. I’ve worked for the local newspaper - The Consort Enterprise - as a reporter and photographer for 4 years. Some of my hobbies include doing all manners of art (drawing, painting, etc.) alongside listening to music, watching Doctor Who, reading tons of books, and taking photos of lightning during thunderstorms.
Sam Davies
I am a Grade 12 student and have been a part of iGEM for the last two years. I love all forms of science and math so it is an amazing opportunity to be involved in such a great program. Next year I plan on taking engineering at either the University of Alberta or the University of Calgary. In addition to iGEM, my interests include reading, playing tenor sax, teaching piano and dancing.
Mr. Gerry Bourassa
Science has always been a passion of mine and I love learning about it and sharing that information with others. I learned about the iGEM competition and synthetic biology at our science teachers' conference and couldn’t wait to tell my students about it. The potential of this field of study is amazing! It is also a lot more difficult in practice than it is in theory. When I’m not in school I enjoy traveling, skiing and restoring my old motorcycle and sports car."

Modelling
Making a sensor involves more than just the creation of the basic biological circuit, as there could be many factors that might improve the performance of the system. An example of these could be the strength of the RBS, the spacing between the promoter and the reporter gene, or the copy number of the plasmid used to house the circuit. While we couldn't nearly address all of these points in our project, we did want to look into the optimization of our system. To do this, we turned to mathematical modelling to create a visual representation of our system.
We worked off of a basic framework published by Koutinas, M., et al., [see here] which was modelling the expression of the Ps promoter with XylR induction. The Ps promoter is the natural promoter found with the xylR gene, and the XylR protein can interact with both it and the Pu promoter we used in our project. Due to similarities between the Ps and Pu promoters, we assumed the deactivation rate of the two components were alike. For remaining values, we simply replaced the values of the Ps promoter with known values of the Pu promoter, keeping constants reported for XylR the same. In the end, we created five equations to represent the action of our system. Our model shows our BioBrick producing the protein XylR, binding with xylene and the relationship to the output of our respective proteins. Each of our formulas are constructed as a rate in which a concentration or output is given of a specific substance in respect to time- otherwise known as a derivative. We will now expand upon the equations we modified and used.
The first equation above represents the transcription of DNA into the XylR RNA transcript. RNA is the representation of the transcript, with P representing the number of plasmids inside a cell. J23100TC represents the activity of our promoter controlling XylR. ta is the transcription rate of the xylR into RNA, based on the transcription rate of E. coli and the size of XylR, and KRNAdeg represents the degradation rate in the E. coli.
The second and third equations represent the inactive and active forms of XylR- or the concentration of XylR that has not bonded to xylene (XylRi) and the concentration of XylR that has bonded to xylene (XylRa). RNA is the substitution of our first equation. tr is the translation rate of our RNA into XylR. rXylR is the oligomerization constant of XylR, rR,XylR is the dissociation constant of active XylR, and xyl in the total concentration of xylene. αXylRi accounts for degradation of XylR.
The fourth equation represents the concentration of xylene present. XylRi and XylRa refer to the concentrations of the inactive and active forms of XylR. rXylR is the oligomerization constant of XylR, rR,XylR is the dissociation constant of inactive XylR and xyl is the total concentration of xylene. αXylRi accounts for the degradation of XylRa, which would release the xylene it held. We multiplied by seconds per hour to get a domain more realistic to our needs.
The fifth equation represents the output of the pu promoter. PuTC represents the activity of the Pu promoter or the output of protein. αpu is the deactivation rate of the Pu promoter. KXylRa is the activation coefficients of the Pu due to binding and nps,ais the hill coefficient for the interaction. β0 and βPS are the basal and maximal expression, respectively, of the Pu promoter.
In order to create an output, we used the program Scilab . By inputting these equations into code we were able to have the program calculate our estimates and graph the results. In the end our output was around 5.5 mPoPS. This is a logical output and tells us our biobrick will successfully over express the protein. We set the output of our model in PoPS due to our system's flexibility when it comes to our reporter protein. This allows us to quickly add in an extra equation to turn our current output into fluorescence, LacZ output, or pigment production without having to worry about editing other parts of our model. Below is a copy of our code that we had used in our program. The resulting graph is the output of our Pu promoter.
While we have yet to apply our modelling framework to the optimization of our sensor, we have created the foundation of a model that can be easily tweaked to test the effect of different variables on sensor performance. Through this we aim to do a sensitivity analysis of the various factors involved in our model in the future so that we can predict what to change for version 2 of our sensor. From there we can return to our model, feeding new data into it to create many future versions of our system, improving performance each time."

Consort’s Collaboration Write Up for Canmore:
Canmore’s project deals primarily with the issue of hair and feather build up in the water treatment systems. This is clearly a major issue and can use extensive amounts of money and time to remedy. There is an extreme amount of inconvenience to unclog the water treatment systems once they get to this point. Creating a BioBrick to produce keratinases could be an effective and cheap solution to the problem and also in preventing the problem.
Our concerns for Canmore lie in the prototype and safety. The specific engineering and prototyping of a bioreactor is extremely important. The conditions required to keep the bacteria alive, the amount of keratinases that would need to be produced, and the length of time this process will take are all aspects to look into when designing the bioreactor. Their plan to use the membrane bioreactor is a very good and easily applicable idea but the research as to optimum conditions concerning the production of the gene is incredibly important. Having a viable analysis of the cost, time and resources required to make this something we can implement is society is also an important consideration. The time frame of how long it takes to break down the keratin is also something to look into. The comparison of the time requirements to break down other pollutants in the bioreactor chamber compared with the time to break down keratin. Knowing this will allow a design maximizing potential.
Other thoughts for them to consider include: what types of bacteria are already being used in the bioreactor? What are they breaking down? Is there a way to genetically modify bacteria already in use to contain the kera or karus gene? This would eliminate the need to introduce another species and readjust conditions while allowing maximum productivity.  Overall, I believe this project could introduce a valid and much needed solution to the issue of hair build up and could be quite effective, quick and safe. As the bioreactor is not connected to the main water line and is completely contained, contamination of water with E. coli would not be an issue. The proposed prototype also utilizes the current system and technologies used making it as easy as possible for implementation. Canmore has done an excellent job in looking at the practical portions of their project and with more research their project could do a lot of good in our world. (-Sam Davies)
Canmore’s Write Up for Consort:
This year the iGem team from Consort is continuing with their ECOS project, bacteria designed to detect the presence of aromatic hydrocarbons in order to prevent any harm to the environment. Consort’s ongoing project is a great concept for many reasons. Firstly it is something that is a local problem in their community and especially hits home for some of the team members, which means that they devote themselves fully to the project. Secondly because the outcome of this project could be very helpful for surrounding communities and possibly could hold some wealth in it. Finally because this project could help save countless amounts of crops and livestock from what is a major threat to them.
The science behind the project is very intriguing as well. The indicator protein is atoned to xylene, which is a very volatile liquid hydrocarbon, which in itself is a good thing to find and remove but it is tied to other dangerous compounds. When these compounds are detected the proteins emit a color indication that would alert the user to the presence of said dangerous compounds. Whilst this all seems simple the biobrick is not, and they have spent years developing this to perfection to start with their prototypes.
The prototype and models of prototypes look to be a very effective method of using ECOS. I was able to see one of the prototypes and it looked good even though I was unable to see it in action, this shows great promise for the team in their upcoming endeavors. I can see much success in the future if this team especially if they have a working prototype at the giant Jamboree, I personally wish them the best (-Joshua Lamb)"

Each team must clearly attribute work done by the student team members on this page. The team must distinguish work done by the students from work done by others, including the host labs, advisors, instructors, and individuals not on the team roster.
Can we base our project on a previous one?
Yes! You can have a project based on a previous team, or based on someone else's idea, as long as you state this fact very clearly and give credit for the original project.
Why is this page needed?
The Attribution requirement helps the judges know what you did yourselves and what you had help with. We don't mind if you get help with difficult or complex techniques, but you must report what work your team did and what work was done by others.
For example, you might choose to work with an animal model during your project. Working with animals requires getting a license and applying far in advance to conduct certain experiments in many countries. This is difficult to achieve during the course of a summer, but much easier if you can work with a postdoc or PI who has the right licenses.

Aoife O'Brien-Horgan
I am a first year medical student and this is my first year partaking in a research project. It has been incredibly inspiring to meet the wonderful people in this community. Over this summer, I aided my teammates with lab work and also had to learn to code, the latter consumed much more of my time! However, I have come to realise that synthetic biology is an area I would love to work in after I finish my studies at university. A random fact about me is that my favourite number is 5!
Amy Keane
I am a second year biomedical science student studying both in University College Cork and Cork Institute of Technology. I have a keen interest in biochemistry and this is the first time I’ve worked on a research project. It has been unlike something I could have imagined as iGEM is so unique. It was under our control and this is something I enjoyed as I felt a real sense of teamwork. Random fact about me is I had my first coffee on the week of the wiki freeze!
Brandon Malone
I am a first year pharmacy student interested in all things science related. Before applying to take part in the iGEM competition, I had never really heard of synthetic biology however I knew I was interested in several areas that fell under the branch of synthetic biology such as metabolic engineering. I was involved in the lab throughout the summer and also was involved in a side chemistry project.  When I’m not in the lab, I regularly go to the gym or go for a run.
Donnchadh O’Sullivan
I’m a fourth year medical student currently studying at UCC. I went to Malawi as part of our iGEM outreach. It was an amazing experience and definitely something that I would recommend everyone to do. We investigated the usefulness of our DNA-diagnostics system in a third world hospital laboratory and integrated what I experienced there into our project. It’s great to see a working relationship between clinical experience and lab-work. I also interned at IndieBio where I met some inspirational people changing the world for the better. I seem to be thrown into a world of synthetic biology and I’m happy here! A random fact about me is that I play the bassoon!
Leanne O'Sullivan
I am currently in third year of Biomedical Science at University College Cork & Cork Institute of Technology. This is my second year taking part in iGEM and working with the Basehunter system. I had the opportunity to play a bigger role in lab work this year. I learned last year that engaging with the public and wider scientific community is vital and I got a chance to work on this a lot this year. A random fact about about me is I pull excellent ice cream cones!
Shama Chilakwad
I am a fourth year Genetics student. This is my second year participating in iGEM so I was able to mentor the new team members on various aspects of the iGEM experience. This year I took a different role and I wanted to get more involved with the synthetic biology community in Cork.  I did this by interning as Assistant Director with IndieBio, a synthetic biology accelerator that coincidentally takes place on UCC campus over the summer months. By doing this our team had ample opportunity to meet other people with similar scientific interests. Not so fun fact about me is that I HATE sneezing.
Timothy O’Flynn
I am a fourth year Genetics student and it is also my second year participating in iGEM. Like Shama, I also wanted to investigate all the avenues for synthetic biology in Cork. While I was mentoring and helping the team I was also interning for a company called BioCellection who participated in the IndieBio programme. This expanded my lab work experience and I also got to understand how synthetic biology is impacting our world. Random fact about me is that very few people have seen me without my headphones on!

Magnetosome - Nanostructure with Great Application Potentials
Figure 1: Magnetosome
Magnetosome is a kind of rare intracellular membrane-bound structure in a specific type of prokaryotes, of nano-size ranging about 35 - 120 nm. They comprise of a magnetic mineral crystal encapsulated by a lipid bilayer about 3 – 4 nm thick (Figure 1) [1], which might be utilized in various applications involving magnetic field.
The magnetosome membrane is highly significant for its biogenesis as it creates an isolated environment within the cell crucial for mineral crystal nucleation and growth [2]. These inorganic crystals are magnetic in nature (hence its name), which compose of either magnetite (Fe3O4) or greigite (Fe3S4). The magnetosomes usually arrange in one or multiple chains along the cell axis. Different varieties of crystal morphologies such as cubo-octahedral, elongated hexagonal prismatic, and bullet-shaped morphologies were discovered in different magnetotactic bacteria [1].
Magnetotactic Bacteria - The Magnetosome Producer
Figure 2: Micrograph of a Magnetotactic Bacteria, Magnetospirillum gryphiswaldense (image from Departamento de Inmunología, Microbiología y Parasitología, University of the Basque Country)
Magnetosomes are organelles synthesized by magnetotactic bacteria for its movement along magnetic field. These magnetotactic bacteria are mobile, aquatic, gram-negative prokaryotes [3] with an array of cellular morphologies, including coccoid, rod-shaped, vibrioid, helical or even multi-cellular. Some of them are more extensively studied, including Magnetospirillum magnetotacticum and Magnetospirillum gryphiswaldense. They are found optimally grown at the oxic-anoxic interface in aquatic habitats, and in fact grow less happily under atmospheric oxygen concentration.
Magnetosomes form a chain and are aligned along the axis within the bacteria. With these magnetosomes inside them, they are able to align passively to the earth’s magnetic field so as to swim along geomagnetic field lines. This behaviour is called magnetotaxis and is beneficial to their survival by aiding them to reach regions of optimal oxygen concentrations at minimal energy cost [4].
Azotobacter vinelandii - What and Why?
Although magnetotactic bacteria produces magnetosomes, these bacteria are notorious for the difficulty to cultivate owing to their micro-aerophilic nature. Elaborate growth techniques are required, and they are difficult to grow on the surface of agar plates, introducing problems in mutant screening [5].
The lack of effective methods of DNA transfer in these microorganisms is a challenge too. Luckily, the situation is improving due to better technologies recently and some of the genes from M. magnetotacticum were confirmed functionally expressed in Escherichia coli, a common lab bacteria strain. This shows that the transcriptional and translational elements of the two microorganisms are compatible. With such good news, a number of previous iGEM teams including Kyoto-2014, OCU-China-2013, Washington-2011 and UNIK_Copenhagen-2013 have been working with transferring the magnetosome-related genes to E. coli. Some exciting results about the formation of magnetosome membrane in E. coli (by the Kyoto-2014 team) has been reported, however, never the whole magnetosome.
Figure 3: Azotobacter vinelandii
We wonder why magnetosomes seem so hard to be formed in E. coli. And then, we come up with a hypothesis - the formation of magnetosome requires a micro-aerobic or anaerobic environment as the magnetotatic bacteria are all living micro-aerobically.
Therefore, we chose a new bacteria to work on our magnetosome project - Azotobacter vinelandii.
A. vinelandii is gram-negative diazotroph (nitrogen-fixing microorganism). It is a soil bacterium related to the Pseudomonas genus that fixes nitrogen under aerobic conditions while having enzymatic mechanisms protecting its oxygen-sensitive nitrogenase from oxidative damage. This finding shows that A. vinelandii could be an excellent host for the production and characterization of oxygen-sensitive proteins or organelles in our case [6].
With the biggest advantage of using Azotobacter that it being an aerobe providing an intracellular anaerobic environment, we can grow it easily in normal lab conditions without expensive equipments, while fulfilling the formation criteria for magnetosome.  Besides, most parts in registry are compatible in Azotobacter and it is of safety level group 1. One more important thing is that it can conduct homologous recombination for stable genome integration,  which is a critical process we need in our project.
Magnetosome Island Genes - Everything Required for Magnetosome Formation
For the synthesis of magnetosome, it is strictly controlled by a group of genes clustered in the magnetosome island (MAI). MAI comprise of four operons, namely mms6, mamGFDC, mamAB and mamXY operons [5]. The actual size and organisation of the MAI might differ between species, but the operons seems to be highly conserved within the MAI [2].
Through genetic mutants, researches has shown with the deletion of mamAB operon would lead to non-magnetic phenotype, showing the importance of mamAB operon as minimal requirement for magnetosome formation and other important functions such as membrane invagination, iron transport, and magnetite biomineralization [7].
In the bacteria Magnetospirillum gryphiswaldense, the mamAB operon consists of 17 genes, namely mamH, -I, -E, -J, -K, -L, -M, -N, -O, -P, -A, -Q, -R, -B, -S, -T, and -U.
Biogenesis of Magnetosome
Now let's look at the biosynthesis of magnetosomes as a multistep complex process.
Figure 4: Overview of Magnetosome Formation
First, the inner membrane of the bacteria swells outwards for vesicle invaginations. The following step is to sort magnetosome proteins to the mangetosome membrane (MM) to perform specific functions in the transport and accumulation of iron.
After protein sorting to the MM, the next step is iron uptake.  The need to import iron for magnetite production makes MTB differs from other bio-mineralizers. Iron transporters in the MM   would pump Fe2+/Fe3+ into the vesicle.
Additionally, mamM, mamB, and mamH were suggested as additional iron transporters for magnetite biomineralization. As the concentration of iron ions increases inside the vesicle, biomineralization occurs [8].
The process of magnetite biomineralization is tightly regulated through specific conditions such as: pH and the concentration of iron within the vesicle. It was also shown that such formation only occurs below a threshold value of 10 mbar of atmospheric pressure, and is inhibited at higher oxygen concentrations. In other words, the size of particles is limited by atmospheric pressure and oxygen concentration. It is found that at 0.25 mbar, magnetite biomineralization can produce particles up to 42 nm. As the condition rise to 10 mbar, the particle size dropped to about 20 nm. [9]  As the biomineralization of the magnetosome is reported to be highly affected by oxygen, we propose an educated guess that magnetosome will have a higher probability to be successfully formed in our bacteria Azotobacter rather than E. coli due to its intracellular microaerobic characteristic.

Prof. King Ming Chan is an Associate Professor of School of Life Sciences and Director of Environmental Science Program, Faculty of Science, Chinese University. His research focuses on Aquatic Toxicology and Molecular Endocrinology using fish models.  Dr. Chan also studies the regulation of eukaryotic gene expression and transcription, focusing on understanding how metal-regulatory-element-binding transcription factors (MTFs) control metallothionein genes and how Pit-1s control pituitary polypeptide hormone genes.
Professor TF Chan
Prof. Ting-Fung Chan is an Assistant Professor in the School of Life Sciences, and the Deputy Director of the Centre for Microbial Genomics and Proteomics at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. He is the Coordinator of the CUHK iGEM team. His researches mainly focus on genomics and bioinformatics of microbial pathogens and complex human phenotypes. He enjoys talking about science, but even more so for toys: Mindstorms NXT, RX-178, 5D Mk-II, LX200-ACF, YAS-875EX, and iGEM. He wishes his students would comprehend the fun and excitement of all aforementioned, but if that is not possible then at the very least, iGEM.
Professor SK Kong
Prof. Kong's laboratory studies the process of apoptosis. In particular, he is interested in elucidating how mitochondria regulate the apoptosis in 'normal' and drug-resistant cancer cells. He wonders how the resistance of mitochondria to MMP can explain the resistance of cancer cells to apoptosis induction, and he hopes to develop strategies for overcoming chemotherapy resistance by targeting tumor mitochondria. He believes that pharmacological interventions on mitochondria are good strategies to promote cell death in tumor cells. This research topic on apoptosis is therefore relevant to disease treatment with socioeconomic impacts."

He is the Coordinator of the CUHK iGEM team. His researches mainly focus on genomics and bioinformatics of microbial pathogens and complex human phenotypes. He enjoys talking about science, but even more so for toys: Mindstorms NXT, RX-178, 5D Mk-II, LX200-ACF, YAS-875EX, and iGEM. He wishes his students would comprehend the fun and excitement of all aforementioned, but if that is not possible then at the very least, iGEM.
Professor SK Kong
Prof. Kong's laboratory studies the process of apoptosis. In particular, he is interested in elucidating how mitochondria regulate the apoptosis in 'normal' and drug-resistant cancer cells. He wonders how the resistance of mitochondria to MMP can explain the resistance of cancer cells to apoptosis induction, and he hopes to develop strategies for overcoming chemotherapy resistance by targeting tumor mitochondria. He believes that pharmacological interventions on mitochondria are good strategies to promote cell death in tumor cells. This research topic on apoptosis is therefore relevant to disease treatment with socioeconomic impacts."

About us
We are the iGEM Aalto-Helsinki 2015. We are an interdisciplinary group with a common interest in synthetic biology. Last year's team recruited us so none of us knew each other in the beginning of summer. We set out to create an interesting project, acquire friendships, learn new skills and most importantly, have fun.
Our team is exceptionally interdisciplinary, with people from various fields and plenty of different skills gathered within. We were excited to see how far we can take our project this summer and how to combine all of our skills to produce the best results. While we divided ourselves to subgroups to organize the work load, many of us found ourselves swept away from the original plans to things we'd never imagined doing before. Our project kept expanding with our hunger to do even more and take everything out of our team and this summer.
Here are the members of Aalto-Helsinki 2015, ready bring you the Fuel for the Future!
Members
Annakarin Korppoo
Molecular Biosciences, University of Helsinki
Why iGEM?
A friend of mine was a part of Aalto-Helsinki 2014 team and she had a really great experience. When the application period for 2015 started, I figured I might as well try it out: iGEM is a unique project that let’s you get in touch with synthetic biology - something that is not widely studied or taught in the universities in Finland. I thought it would be a great first touch to the field.
Describe yourself shortly.
I’m a 24-year-old fifth year student in the University of Helsinki. I’ve worked in three different plant-related research groups, mostly plant genetics but also a little with plant pathogens in Arabidopsis. I use my free-time with quality TV series such as Game of Thrones and House of Cards. I desperately want a poodle.
Responsibilities in the team:
Labwork, labplanning, design and presentation critic with no knowledge of design
Arto Lehisto
Bioinformation technology, Aalto University
Why iGEM?
It all started on a rainy, gloomy night, when I happened to visit a summer job meetup. Amidst the cool, shiny companies and slick spokespersons stood two figures: Members of the Aalto-Helsinki 2014 team. After describing what sounded like a perfect summer experience, they had the gall to say that the application period was open, and, well, the rest is history. Synthetic biology is not a subject I was familiar with when I applied to iGEM, but since my major is basically a patchwork of different sciences, I decided to apply. And what do you know, it seems I got accepted. At least no one has notified me of the possibility that I shouldn’t be here.
Describe yourself shortly.
Male, 21 years of age, human-sized. I’m a third year student at Aalto university. On my free time I read books, mostly (science) fiction, as well as watch movies and tv shows. I also like creating solutions to nonexistent problems.
Responsibilities in the team:
Modeling, fundraising, member of the council of bad jokes
Juuso Rusanen
Medicine and Molecular Biosciences, University of Helsinki
Why iGEM?
The Aalto-Helsinki 2014 team got me really interested in iGEM. I figured the potential of synthetic biology in medicine is enormous, so it would be nice to learn to better understand it. Besides that, I applied for our iGEM team because I wanted to try something completely different, get to meet great people and have a fun summer. I had big expectations, but I still learnt much more than I could have imagined!
Describe yourself shortly.
I'm starting the 3rd year of my medical studies and my 4th year in molecular biosciences. I have worked in a couple of research groups, studying serological antibody detection, mammalian signaling pathways and cancer gene therapy. I like spreadsheets and cycling. I'm also fairly excited about urban planning.
Responsibilities in the team:
lab/modeling mediator, human practices and a bit of lab planning, among other things
Linda Hyrkkänen
Food Technology, Aalto University
Why iGEM?
I knew people from last year's team and their summer seemed amazing. I could be doing mindless factory work or tackling interdisciplinary problems with other students! Synthetic biology is a pretty new and exciting challenge for me, but I’m used to working with varying scientific fields. And we can tailor this summer to our interests and skills, what could be better?
Describe yourself shortly.
I’m starting my fifth year in Chemical Engineering, with graduation creeping terrifyingly close. I’m aiming for product development to fill the world with foods I like. Outside iGEM work, I like gaming and crafts although I have a bad habit of juggling five projects simultaneously.
Responsibilities in the team:
Funding, design and some coding, poking my finger in all the other things as needed
Milla-Mari Vastavuo
Environmental Management, Aalto University
Why iGEM?
My first touch with iGEM happened around one year ago. I saw a sticker of an Aalto-Helsinki bacterium during an event. I checked their web page, but the topic didn’t really fit in to my studies. However, the team got me excited about iGEM during a big University event. I didn’t have any more knowledge of synthetic biology than basics of biology from high school. I decided that this was a once in a lifetime chance and I can’t wait and the things I don’t know, I’ll learn.
Describe yourself shortly.
I’m a 24-year old student from Aalto University. My studies are strongly related to the environmental perspective in the industry. I’ve participated in several multidisciplinary projects and I find it fascinating to work with different people. The nature is close to my heart and there is nothing better than capturing beautiful pictures while walking in the forest. Additionally, table tennis has had a big part in my life.
Responsibilities in the team:
Organizing project funding and travel schedule for Boston, photographing and creating visuals, once in a while visiting lab… for photos
Petra Tuomiranta
Biotechnology, University of Helsinki
Why iGEM?
When I first heard of iGEM the idea of creating something new without anyone telling you what to do fascinated me. I ran into my tutor (who was part of the first ever Aalto-Helsinki team) at a dinner party last autumn and his stories about “learning tons of new things” and “the best summer ever” made iGEM sound just the perfect way of spending a summer. So, when the application period finally started I rushed to write the most enthusiastic application I’ve ever made in my life and here I am now. I really feel that my biotechnology studies have been in a good use during the summer as I wanted, but working with our own, super interesting propane project has taught me more that I could have imagined at the beginning!
Describe yourself shortly.
I’m a 23-year-old student from the University of Helsinki. I’ve been studying for four years - one of them abroad and gotten more and more interested in my field when learning more. On my freetime I enjoy doing all sorts of things from having a good time with my friends to doing sports.
Responsibilities in the team:
lab, lab planning every now and then, social media
Riikka Huusari
Applied mathematics, University of Helsinki
Why iGEM?
Applied mathematics is of no use if you don’t have the field of application. I had never thought of synthetic biology beforehand, but as soon as I heard about this it got my interest. Complex biological reactions to model, who wouldn’t like the sound of it? Turns out it was really interesting and a bit more of a challenge that I thought. I think there is some kind of conspiracy of biologists in regarding the naming of the enzymes.. Why can’t you guys think of different names for enzymes that have completely different structure and performance?
Describe yourself shortly.
I’m 23-year-old applied mathematics student from University of Helsinki, where I’m currently pursuing my master’s degree. Besides maths I enjoy reading and handcrafts, and when there isn't too much snow I like to go to my summer cottage.
Responsibilities in the team:
Modeling, coding wiki and web page
Tamannae Alam
Biology and Physics, University of Helsinki
Why iGEM?
One day I got an email about iGEM from the mailing list. I have always wondered how I could combine biology and physics as I like both subjects. They give a different perspective to nature which is why I study them as my majors. As I read more about iGEM, I got more interested in synthetic biology. Synthetic biology seems to be a solution to my problem. That's why I feel so lucky that I have been chosen to be a member of this year's iGEM team as I now have the possibility to learn about synthetic biology in practice.
Describe yourself shortly.
I’m a 4th year biology and a 3rd year physics student. My ultimate goal is to get a doctoral degree from both. It seems ambitious but I want to do a research on both subjects. I also like to watch sports, such as athletics and football, and I occasionally play badminton.
Responsibilities in the team:
Lab, constant checker and bioinformatics.
Tuukka Miinalainen
Bioprocess Technology, Aalto University
Why iGEM?
Last year, I read about synthetic biology and iGEM-foundation from the bachelor’s thesis of my friend who told me that the first Aalto-Helsinki team was found. The field seemed novel and my studies contained only a couple laboratory lessons with recombinant techniques. However, the application period for the first team had already been closed so I had to wait a year before the new attempt.
Describe yourself shortly.
I’m a 23-year-old chemical engineering student and started my final year in Aalto University. Although the current iGEM-project is heavily related to the research work, my intention is to focus more on process designing after graduation. My hobbies vary a lot and depend on the current life situation: last spring I got bored with Krav Maga and now I’m planning to start rock climbing during next autumn.
Responsibilities in the team:
Lab work, lab planning, some funding
Victor Rodrigues
Mathematics, University of Helsinki
Why iGEM?
Last year a friend introduced me to synthetic biology, and I was mesmerized about the advancements this field was bringing to humanity. I thought then that IGEM, currently the biggest international competition in synthetic biology, would be an exciting place to get introduced to the area, since it connects people from so many backgrounds, not only biology students. I am so passionate about mathematics, and it makes me happy every time I see the impact it causes in the lab work.
Describe yourself shortly.
I have lived on Ilha do Governador, an island almost forgotten by the government of Rio, Brazil, for almost all my life. “All my life” has therefore felt like an eternity - I wanted to meet different people with diverse backgrounds and experiences to share, and I constantly sought for this in that small island. My quest was insatiable, and in 2013 I decided to start my bachelor’s degree in mathematics in Finland. This February, when I was 19, I finished my Bachelor of Science, and this semester I am coming back to work as a consultant in Brazil, where I expect to help solving big problems affecting the country.
Responsibilities in the team:
Modelling, programming and once in a while visiting lab.
Proodle
Why iGEM?
There was never any other option for me, I was (quite literally) born for this! I want to save the day and show everyone how great synthetic biology is. I love meeting new people, so I make sure to travel with the team whenever possible.
Describe yourself shortly.
I'm an adventurous creature who has synthetic biology close to heart. I love spending time with my team mates and advising them if they have some difficulties regarding their project. My favorite place is high up on the shelf so I can oversee everything that happens in the project. I'm quite photogenic, so you can see me all over the teams' blogposts and wiki. You may even see me in their contact cards. Come and get your own!
Responsibilities in the team:
Motivating the team to reach their very best. And looking soft.

Hailing from different backgrounds, the unique capabilities of each of our team members laid a strong foundation for the team to carry out most of the tasks ourselves. We conceived the idea, consulting it with our promoter, supervisor and the other advisers, seeking their valuable feedback. After receiving proper trainings, we proceeded with the experiments on our own.
The implication of the saying 'Rome was not built in a day' can be applicable to our project as well in such a manner, that a project like this takes time and effort and requires a strong and tuned team play. We are proud to communicate that together as a team, we were able to conduct every part of this challenge on our own. Be it a design of the wiki or the scientific illustrations, hours spent in the wet or dry labs, sponsor campaigns or symposium organization, we completed everything ourselves, without the need for any commercial or external assistance, and with only limited supervision.
We extend our gratitude to our sponsors for granting us the required laboratory materials, equipment and, above all, for their financial support throughout the course of our project.
On this page, we would like to thank everyone who contributed to our project.

Our team consists of 13 students who have dedicated their summer to work on the iGEM project. The numerous late night meetings organised from the beginning of the year 2015 were the perfect opportunity to create an optimal atmosphere to discuss the possible iGEM projects and to boost the team spirit. The team consists of students from 5 different faculties with different backgrounds, perspectives, nationalities, and languages. The diversity of the team gives us the strength and widens our horizons. We are all bound by our enthusiasm for science and research, and each of us possesses the courage to face big challenges. Additionally, we are supported by previous iGEM’mers and employees from various levels of the KU Leuven University. The previous KU Leuven teams have set high standards to benchmark ourselves against. We will do our best to carry on this trend in the 2015 iGEM competition!

First on the screen, now in real life
Astrid does many things, she started as a bookworm who shaped our plasmid, worked in the lab, made plans for the symposium and visited schools to explain children about synthetic biology.
Eline started working on gaining sponsors for our project. Then she made the collaboration with Toulouse possible by creating a diffusion model in COMSOL. In the end she helped with the wiki.
Frederik's background in economics made him the perfect guy to acquire sponsors for our project. He created the survey. He explored several applications and wrote an economical report about it.
Ines discovered the world of social media to inform people about our project. When she isn't updating the public she can be found in the lab or behind her books.
Jasper is the brains behind our internal model. Apart from modeling he found time to invent, create and adjust our card game.
Laetitia delegated the lab work, planned frequent meetings, wrote new protocols and filled in our lab safety form. Additionally she provided general texts for the wiki.
Convincing people and companies to invest in our project became Laura's personal challenge, this included making the sponsor brochure and folder. Beside you can also find her in the lab.
Laurens started as our personal Photoshop hero who somehow still found time to 'GO TO THE LAB'. So he became our part-time Photoshop hero and part-time lab buddy.
With her background in web design, Leen was the ideal member to create our wiki. The whole summer she spent time on creating new pages, fixing mistakes and expanding our wiki.
Moritz was the first of our model team to finish his colony level model. He also contributed PDE-solvers and helped getting the wiki ready in time, the Outreach section in particular.
Ovia had the difficult task to ensure communication within the team. When she isn't working in the lab she provides us with beautiful images for the stickers and our wiki.
Thomas is our hybrid model specialist. He was the connection between lab and modeling so all the necessary information was passed trough.
In the beginning Vincent was the designated bookworm who browsed trough literature at full speed. When enough information was gathered he used this knowledge in the lab.

The Team
The DTU iGEM Team 2015 is composed of a group of ten motivated DTU students dedicated to exploring and sharing their passion for science. The team includes both Bachelor and Master students with a diverse set of nationalities and educational backgrounds in Biochemistry, Molecular Biology, Bioinformatics, Pharmaceutical engineering and Computer Sciences. Many of the team members are highly engaged in internationally recognized research groups, leading biotech companies or student organizations, where they have obtained valuable competences within science, programming, project management and communication.  Our team is unified by the shared goal of providing significant achievements within the field of synthetic biology.
The project officially started with an introductory iGEM meeting in January, facilitated by our supervisor Chris Workman. From then on our team met weekly with idea development until Mads and Pernille, came up with our project idea. Many months of project planning, fundraising, lab work and coding have lead to the product we now present for you. All laboratory work and presented activities documented on this wiki were performed by our team members and the three high school students unless stated otherwise.
We would like to thank our advisors who assisted us during the whole project and have provided invaluable advice and feedback. We would also express our thanks to everyone else who has supported us over the course project! Thank you for your expertise, facilities and materials. A full list of attributions can be seen below.

The Team
The DTU iGEM Team 2015 is composed of a group of ten motivated DTU students dedicated to exploring and sharing their passion for science. The team includes both Bachelor and Master students with a diverse set of nationalities and educational backgrounds in Biochemistry, Molecular Biology, Bioinformatics, Pharmaceutical engineering and Computer Sciences. Many of the team members are highly engaged in internationally recognized research groups, leading biotech companies or student organizations, where they have obtained valuable competences within science, programming, project management and communication.  Our team is unified by the shared goal of providing significant achievements within the field of synthetic biology.
The project officially started with an introductory iGEM meeting in January, facilitated by our supervisor Chris Workman. From then on our team met weekly with idea development until Mads and Pernille, came up with our project idea. Many months of project planning, fundraising, lab work and coding have lead to the product we now present for you. All laboratory work and presented activities documented on this wiki were performed by our team members and the three high school students unless stated otherwise.
We would like to thank our advisors who assisted us during the whole project and have provided invaluable advice and feedback. We would also express our thanks to everyone else who has supported us over the course project! Thank you for your expertise, facilities and materials. A full list of attributions can be seen here .

Our Team
Sierra Tackett
I am a senior Biochemistry major with the hopes of going to medical school. I coordinated all of the projects that our team accomplished apart from lab. This included coordinating the summer camp, policy & practices work, and performing background research. Over my three years in iGEM, I have developed a passion for coordinating the Bioengineering Summer Camp, and I will miss doing this greatly. I was responsible for organizing the outside of lab curriculum and activities, as well as making sure the marketing was accomplished and that everybody had food to eat! I also mapped out the wiki page, organized content, and delegated who was responsible for what. I further ensured that leadership would transition well by creating an instruction manual with all of the details pertinent to running an iGEM team at WLC. It’s so hard to pick my favorite iGEM moment! This is my third year on the team, and presenting in Boston would have to be my favorite “moment”. I loved the city, being around my team members, and speaking with all of the iGEM teams across the world!
Aside from iGEM, I work as a medical scribe and love learning in the fast paced environment of the emergency departments that I work in. I have interned at the Medical Examiner's Office, and hope to become a pathologist some day. My favorite money drain is my growing collection of stationary and office supplies and spend more time than I should ""jammin on my planner"".
Matthew Mortensen
I am currently a senior Biochemistry major attending WLC. My primary role on this year’s team was acting as the lab manager. This involved deciding which experiments needed to be performed, delegating the lab workload, designing primers, troubleshooting problems, and most often just performing the protocols that needed to be done all while training the next generation of WLC iGEMers in lab. Outside of the lab, my main contribution to the team was the design and implementation of our wiki page (shout out w3cschools). I was the programmer behind our modeling program. I also rewrote the lab curriculum in our summer-camp binder. My favorite responsibility was being the primary lab instructor for our synthetic biology summer camp for high-school students. As a lab instructor I did prep work for labs, went through (sometimes) short lectures on the theoretical basis of the experiments we were performing, and finally guided the group through the planned procedures. All of our procedures worked this year which was excellent, and during the down-time between steps we were able to review and reinforce the concepts learned that day in the lecture portions.
Outside of the lab, when I have time, I enjoy exploring new types of music, comic books, the occasional video game, long walks to just organize my thoughts, NPR, and Netflix. In the future I hope to pursue a career in research by attending graduate school, although I am not truly sure of what I want to focus on just yet.
Jordyn Pieper
I am currently a junior biology student at WLC and this year on iGEM I have been in charge of the completion of the surveys by the WELS high school science teachers. My biggest time contributions have gone toward the policy and practices section of the project. I have organized meetings and have done what I could to make things as easy as possible. I have also helped in the editing of the articles that we have put onto our website. My favorite iGEM moment would be the first time I met the other members of the team. The first impression that they gave me assured me that I would be working with a group of determined people who planned on having fun in the process.
Harrison Fleming
I am a sophomore intending to major in Biology with a Chemistry minor. Much of the work I did for iGEM was in the lab which consisted of projects such as phage isolation, cloning and Kirby-Bauer Assays. In the lab I also focused on obtaining the knowledge and skills to take over leading the laboratory work in coming years. Outside of the lab I assisted this year’s iGEM team with the survey as well as writing an article on Klebsiella and Yersinia Pestis. My favorite moment from iGEM thus far was successfully moving the Klebsiella tolC to the PSB1C3 Plasmid. It has been an awesome learning experience so far and I intend to continue with it in the coming years!
Christa Winslow
I am a senior Biochemistry major. Unfortunately due to extensive traveling I was unable to be as active on the team this year as I have been in the past. Rather than working directly in lab, my primary contribution was doing background research and writing the page on antibiotic resistance mechanisms. However, I also helped in proofreading other portions of the wiki, drafting survey questions, presenting at Biotechnology Information Night, and generally being a source of calmness and stability for the team. The highlight of this iGEM season for me lies in the time I spent studying abroad in England. It was nostalgic and encouraging to stay in contact with my team back in Wisconsin. Hearing about their progress on the project always brightened my day.
Ryan George
I am a senior Biochemistry major at WLC. I have been a part of the iGEM team for the past two years. This year I took a step back due to having multiple jobs, so I primarily worked on graphic and website design for the ‘tolsee’ project. My favorite part of iGEM this year was learning how to use Photoshop from scratch. During just about any day you can find me at one of my three jobs: I work as a dental assistant, ER medical scribe, and as a team lead concert technician. When I have time to life, I enjoy cooking and playing the guitar.
Lakaysha Blacksher
I am the Research Assistant to the Professor of Anthropology (Dr. Ned Farley) at WLC. I graduated from Saint Francis High School in 2012, and am currently a junior studying Biological Anthropology with an intended minor in Spanish. My involvement with this year's project is based in Human Practices; exploring the cultural boundaries and effects of introducing biotechnology to developing countries. My hobbies include billiards, music, reading, and crying before exams. I hope to use my degree to become a Forensic Investigator or professor of Anthropology. I intend to stay on with WLC's iGEM team until graduation, and also plan to publish several articles, including a study on Roman-era metallurgy.
Jacob Jodat
I am a junior biochemistry major with aspirations to attend medical school following my undergraduate education. This is my second year on the iGEM team. My role on the team was to assist with lab work, research diseases that are relevant to our project, and help out at our synthetic biology summer camp.  My favorite part about iGEM is getting experience in the lab. I enjoy being able to see the whole process of a research project rather than doing several unrelated labs one time in a class. Outside of iGEM I participate on the track and cross-country teams on campus.  I also work part-time as an ER medical scribe.  In my free time I enjoy spending time with friends and watching Netflix.
Anna Garvey
I am a Senior Biochemistry student at Wisconsin Lutheran College and have been an iGEM team member for three years. This year, I stepped away from the lab work to spend most of my time focusing on the Policy and Practices portion of the project. I was responsible for writing the various surveys, lecturing at the biotechnology informational event, writing portions of the wiki and doing general wiki editing.  As graduation is approaching, I’ve started to seriously think of what I am going to do after my undergraduate education is through. This is terrifying. Ultimately, I do hope to either attend graduate school to obtain my Ph.D or attend medical school. Until then; however,  I am going to take a few years off in to pursue other dreams of mine. Hopefully, I will spend the next portion of my life teaching students English in various countries across the world through programs such as Friends of China and Hearts of Change. During the summers, I plan to focus on writing a book and traveling the rest of the world. That’s the true dream if I’m being honest with you. There are 6.8 billion people in the world and I want to meet all of them and see their cultures and learn from them all that I can. So that’s the plan. And like I said last year, I really don’t know what I want to do yet, or where I want to go, but I do know that I want to strive to lead a happy life and I suppose that is all I need.
Zach Birner
I am a senior Biochemistry major with the intent of going to medical school. This year is my second as a member of the iGEM team. While the first year I primarily did lab work, this last year I downsized my workload, due to medical school applications, and spent my time with phage therapy research and the summer camp. My favorite part of iGEM was getting to know all the other members with many similar interests. My life outside of iGEM consists of working as an emergency medical technician, playing on the Wisconsin Lutheran College Tennis team, and playing the guitar.
Hannah Rodrigues
I am a senior Biology major that joined iGEM to spark my interest in research. I was involved with the original brainstorming of the project for policy and practices. I also contributed lecture material for Biotechnology Information Night. I look forward to further pursuing biology in my education. IGEM was a great start!
John Bechtel
I am a freshman Biochemistry and Marine Biology major that started iGEM after attending the team’s summer camp! During the time that I have been involved, I have worked on designing and constructing informational boards and posters, survey assistance, and helping develop the Policy & Practices coffee cup lid design. My favorite moment in my short time with the WLC iGEM team was definitely the first official team meeting I attended and getting to see the behind the scenes workings of Genetic Engineering, and the incredible camaraderie of the team.

Our Team
Sierra Tackett
I am a senior Biochemistry major with the hopes of going to medical school. I coordinated all of the projects that our team accomplished apart from lab. This included coordinating the summer camp, policy & practices work, and performing background research. Over my three years in iGEM, I have developed a passion for coordinating the Bioengineering Summer Camp, and I will miss doing this greatly. I was responsible for organizing the outside of lab curriculum and activities, as well as making sure the marketing was accomplished and that everybody had food to eat! I also mapped out the wiki page, organized content, and delegated who was responsible for what. I further ensured that leadership would transition well by creating an instruction manual with all of the details pertinent to running an iGEM team at WLC. It’s so hard to pick my favorite iGEM moment! This is my third year on the team, and presenting in Boston would have to be my favorite “moment”. I loved the city, being around my team members, and speaking with all of the iGEM teams across the world!
Aside from iGEM, I work as a medical scribe and love learning in the fast paced environment of the emergency departments that I work in. I have interned at the Medical Examiner's Office, and hope to become a pathologist some day. My favorite money drain is my growing collection of stationary and office supplies and spend more time than I should ""jammin on my planner"".
Matthew Mortensen
I am currently a senior Biochemistry major attending WLC. My primary role on this year’s team was acting as the lab manager. This involved deciding which experiments needed to be performed, delegating the lab workload, designing primers, troubleshooting problems, and most often just performing the protocols that needed to be done all while training the next generation of WLC iGEMers in lab. Outside of the lab, my main contribution to the team was the design and implementation of our wiki page (shout out w3cschools). I was the programmer behind our modeling program. I also rewrote the lab curriculum in our summer-camp binder. My favorite responsibility was being the primary lab instructors for our synthetic biology summer camp for high-school students. As a lab instructor I did prep work for labs, went through (sometimes) short lectures on the theoretical basis of the experiments we were performing, and finally guided the group through the planned procedures. All of our procedures worked this year which was excellent, and during the down-time between steps we were able to review and reinforce the concepts learned that day in the lecture portions.
Outside of the lab, when I have time, I enjoy exploring new types of music, comic books, the occasional video game, long walks to just organize my thoughts, NPR, and Netflix. In the future I hope to pursue a career in research by attending graduate school, although I am not truly sure of what I want to focus on just yet.
Jordyn Pieper
I am currently a junior biology student at WLC and this year on iGEM I have been in charge of the completion of the surveys by the WELS high school science teachers. My biggest time contributions have gone toward the policy and practices section of the project. I have organized meetings and have done what I could to make things as easy as possible. I have also helped in the editing of the articles that we have put onto our website. My favorite iGEM moment would be the first time I met the other members of the team. The first impression that they gave me assured me that I would be working with a group of determined people who planned on having fun in the process.
Harrison Fleming
I am a sophomore intending to major in Biology with a Chemistry minor. Much of the work I did for iGEM was in the lab which consisted of projects such as phage isolation and cloning. I also assisted this year’s iGEM team with the survey as well as writing an article on Klebsiella and Yersinia Pestis. My favorite moment from iGEM thus far was successfully moving the Klebsiella TolC to the PSB1C3 Plasmid.
Christa Winslow
Ryan George
Lakaysha Blacksher
I am a senior Biological Anthropology major with an intended Spanish minor and I am currently the Research Assistant to the Professor of Anthropology (Dr. Ned Farley) at WLC. My involvement with this year's project is based in Human Practices; exploring the cultural boundaries and effects of introducing biotechnology to developing countries. My hobbies include billiards, music, reading, and crying before exams. I hope to use my degree to become a Forensic Investigator or professor of Anthropology. I intend to stay on with WLC's iGEM team until graduation, and also plan to publish several articles, including a study on Roman-era metallurgy.
Jacob Jodat
I am a junior biochemistry major with aspirations to attend medical school following my undergraduate education. This is my second year on the iGEM team. My role on the team was to assist with lab work, research diseases that are relevant to our project, and help out at our synthetic biology summer camp.  My favorite part about iGEM is getting experience in the lab. I enjoy being able to see the whole process of a research project rather than doing several unrelated labs one time in a class.
Anna Garvey
Zach Birner
I am a Senior Biochemistry with the intent of going to medical school. This year is my second as a member of the iGEM team. While the first year I primarily did lab work, this last year I downsized my workload, due to medical school applications, and spent my time with phage therapy research and the summer camp. My favorite part of iGEM was getting to know all the other members with many similar interests. My life outside of iGEM consists of working as an emergency medical technician, playing on the Wisconsin Lutheran College Tennis team, and playing the guitar.
Hannah Rodrigues
John Bechtel
I am a freshman Biochemistry and Marine Biology major that started iGEM after attending the team’s summer camp! I partook in poster design, survey assistance, and Policy & Practices coffee cup lid design. My favorite iGEM experience thus far has been the summer camp’s trip to MSOE.

Why did you decide to get involved in iGEM?
I believed it would be a great way to get out into the synthetic biology field and tackle a major problem facing the world today. As well, iGEM provides unique opportunities to learn about fundraising, outreach, and many more areas. Its been an absolutely amazing experience so far and everyday presents a new set of fun, yet challenging tasks to do.
Why do you like bees?
Their small, fuzzy, essential little creatures that keep the world alive. ""Buzz, Buzz, Buzz""
Random fact about yourself
I'm secretly batman.
Ishpreet Dhillon
3rd year, Biochemistry
Ishpreet contributed to 6-CNA Degradation, Probeeotic Prototype Testing, and Policy and Practices.
Why did you decide to get involved in iGEM?
For the opportunity to design and conduct a research project, which no other undergraduate lab would allow.
Why do you like bees?
Bees are an essential part of our lives, without them many foods we enjoy wouldn't exist.
Random fact about yourself
I know the alphabet in sign language
Jacqueline Siu
4th year, Microbiology & Immunology Honours
Jacqueline contributed to Modeling.
Why did you decide to get involved in iGEM?
iGEM intrigued me primarily due to its collaborative nature where students from all disciplines work towards a common goal, and the applicability aspect of synthetic biology. Coming from an immunology background, I was excited to incorporate more computational considerations into my projects.
Why do you like bees?
It's not a question of liking bees, but rather the fact we need bees. While I admire all the work bees do for us, I much rather aid them from afar.
Random fact about yourself
I have more competitive swimming suits than shoes and dresses combined.
Jeanne Chan
3rd year, Biochemistry Honours
Jeanne contributed to Wiki and Arts, Genetic Tool Development, Probeeotic Prototype Testing, and Policy and Practices.
Why did you decide to get involved in iGEM?
All the iGEM projects I've seen were very interesting and relatable to different problems present in society. I wanted to see how these projects started. It also seemed like a fun way to get some research experience.
Why do you like bees?
Because bees! They're pollinators and look cute too
Random fact about yourself
My right thumb is larger than my left but it still doesn't have the magical ability to close eppendorf tubes on its own.
Jeff Pea
3rd year, Cell & Developmental Biology Honours
Jeff contributed to Policy and Practices.
Why did you decide to get involved in iGEM?
The field of genetic engineering continues to exponentially grow as scientists continue to find novel, creative ways to tackle some of society's most complex problems. With so many tools in the genetic toolbox, we are almost in the time and age to create anything we can imagine. This mindset is what I see a lot in iGEM: students excited to create projects that push the envelope of what we can do in genetics. Having been on the UBC iGEM team last year and going to Boston for the Giant Jamboree allowed me to see just what brilliant ideas are out there to try and explore. I initially decided to be involved with iGEM to get exposure to the field of genetic engineering and see what it has to offer. I hope to continue that this year by helping this team and seeing what my peers have conjured up in their projects.
Why do you like bees?
Since a very young age, I have had an obsession with insects. Entomology has always been fascinating to me for some reason. While all of my peers irked at the sight of ants and beetles, I would always pick them up and play around with them in my hands. There's something marvelous about how these little critters have grown to populate and diversify our planet. This is especially true for bees, whose existence still fascinates me. Whether it be their intricate relationship with pollination, their unique flight patterns, or their sophiscated hive system, bees are an example of beautifuly complex yet simple creatures. Their role is so integral to the natural ""web"" (pun-intended) of many ecosystems. And as a human, I admire bees for their dedication and selflessness in the workforce.
Random fact about yourself
USMNT, COYS, and TM87! Props to you if you get any of those acronyms.
Jewel Ocampo
3rd year, Microbiology and Immunology Honours
Jewel contributed to Screening, Policy and Practices, Probeeotic Prototype Testing, and Genetic Tool Development.
Why did you decide to get involved in iGEM?
I got involved with iGEM because I wanted to see how the things we've learnt in lecture applied to real life. Sure, reading about a transformation is pretty cool, but performing one yourself beats regurgitating the theory on an exam any day. Also, engineering bacteria to do things for you is pretty rad. Definitely rad.
Why do you like bees?
I like bees because they maintain both ecological diversity and our modern food system. They're the real MVPs when it comes to pollinating the world's flowering plant species as well as agricultural crops like our fruits and veggies. Bees are also cute and fluffy (insert photo of adorable bumblebee here).
Random fact about yourself
I have a small scar on the right-most side of my right eye, which I got from that one time I scraped the entire right side of my face trying to dive and score a goal.
Kevin Ng
4th year, Microbiology & Immunology Honours
Kevin contributed to Modeling, Probeeotic Prototype Testing, and Policy and Practices.
Why did you decide to get involved in iGEM?
It was the multidisciplinary aspect of it that appealed to me - it's so much more fun to work with people outside your area, I think, and to have that constant process of learning and explaining is really great.
Why do you like bees?
They're cute and fluffy, and the black-yellow colour combination is bold and graphic without being obnoxiously loud.
Random fact about yourself
I was terrible at biology in high school. Everyone thought I would become an English major, or a physicist, or literally anything but biology...and yet here I am.
Rohan Chandrasekhar
4th year, Applied Biology
Rohan contributed to Fundraising and Imidacloprid Degradation.
Why did you decide to get involved in iGEM?
iGEM sounded like a fun, educational opportunity to do some really cool science.
Why do you like bees?
Bees are the cornerstone of modern agriculture, and many ecosystems. Try as we may, there is no way that anything can substitute a bees ability to pollinate and also drive evolutionary change. Remove bees from the equation, and expect the world to come crashing down, one species at a time. I appreciate that power.
Random fact about yourself
Sometimes my bellybutton lint looks like Texas
Milagros Sempere
3rd year, Biochemistry Honours
Milagros contributed to 6-CNA Degradation, Probeeotic Prototype Testing, and Policy and Practices.
Why did you decide to get involved in iGEM?
I had heard really positive things about iGEM before applying and upon further investigation I realized it is an incredible opportunity to participate in scientific research. I was drawn to iGEM because it is carried out in a team environment, which I really enjoy, and all members work collaboratively in multiple aspects of the project. In a way, this makes a iGEM as realistic of a research experience as possible and it is also lots of fun!
Why do you like bees?
In my opinion, not only are bees rather fascinating insects but also indispensable; they are a key pollinator of numerous fruits and vegetables that I, along with most of society, love and eat regularly. Equally important, they play a major role in the production of honey beer.
Random fact about yourself
I love trivia.
Nick Echeverria
3rd year, Integrating Infectious Disease and Biopsychology
Nick contributed to Imidacloprid Degradation and Fundraising.
Why did you decide to get involved in iGEM?
iGEM offers students a unique opportunity to learn about almost all aspects of modern scientific research. From conducting experiments in the lab, hosting human practices workshops, modeling and fundraising, iGEM has proven to teach students more than the basics of research. In addition, the UBC iGEM team is home to many young and congenial scientists, making the work environment a fun and exciting one. Due to the amount of things iGEM teaches you and the work environment that is fosters, joining UBC iGEM was a no brainer for me!
Why do you like bees?
I like kiwifruit. I also like strawberries and cantaloupe. Honey is good too.
Random fact about yourself
I like meeting new people.
Vivian Li
2nd year, Biotechnology Honours
Vivian contributed to Screening, Wiki and Arts, and Policy and Practices.
Why did you decide to get involved in iGEM?
Because science! I enjoy project-based work and it seemed so exciting to be able to have hands on lab-experience for which we, as humble undergrads, get to decide the direction and purpose. It seemed like a great opportunity to meet new people and learn from them as well. The competition just add extra fun into the mix.
Why do you like bees?
Once, I put my hand by an active hive and got it covered in bees. I fell in love that day. Also bees pollinate food and food is good.
Random fact about yourself
Owl always love owls.
Yuqing Du
2nd year, Engineering Physics
Yuqing contributed to Genetic Tool Development, Wiki and Arts, Probeeotic Prototype Testing,and Policy and Practices.
Why did you decide to get involved in iGEM?
I heard about range of interesting iGEM projects from a friend at UofT, and figured it would be a great way to acquire some new skills and collaborate with students from other programs and faculties. Needless to say, I've gotten more out of this experience than I bargained for - from researching and brainstorming project ideas, to carrying out the labwork, to building a wiki and engaging in policies and practices.
Why do you like bees?
They're fascinating little critters, and I'm not really sure I could survive without fruits. Like them or not, we definitely need them.
Random fact about yourself
I'm secretly addicted to typography.

Why did you decide to get involved in iGEM?
The 2011 iGEM team was working in a lab that I was moonlighting in when I first started my degree. They slowly started tricking me into helping out with their experiments. Next thing I knew, I was advising the 2012 team. I've been advising ever since -- mainly because I didn't want my PhD to be too short, but also because it has been extremely rewarding watching the students develop.
Why do you like bees?
Because they buzz?
Random fact about yourself
I'm indecisive

Hi! I'm Elynna Chang and I'm a junior at Lambert. I've been on the iGEM team since freshman year, and I love genetic engineering and developmental biology! Besides science, I also love to debate, paint, and play the piano.
ALYSSA FRANKLIN
I’m Alyssa Franklin, a sophomore, and this is my first year on iGEM. For fun I enjoy running, dancing, reading, and playing the guitar.
LILY GE
I'm a senior at Lambert who's been with iGEM since the dawn of time. A brief list of things I love: open source science, number theory proofs, ballet (and Maria Kotchekova), fencing, flowers, art and graphic design, the internet, roller coasters, libraries, late night conversations.
LAUREN HONG
My name is Lauren Hong, and I am currently a sophomore at Lambert High School. Through iGEM, I've been able to explore the power of biology to apply the concepts to our own ideas and designs. Outside of the lab, I'm a competitive soccer player and a passionate violinist.
CHRIS JACKSON
Hi, my name is Chris Jackson, and I'm a sophomore on the Lambert iGEM team. I have helped with the foldscope aspect of our project, and am a student athlete who plays baseball and tennis. I like animals more than people.
JACK KWON
Hi! My name is Jack Kwon and I am one of the members on the Lambert High School iGEM team. I am very interested in the field of biology and plan on pursuing it in college. iGEM has allowed me to experience labs in the high school setting which is very cool and hope to benefit more from being part of the iGEM team!
JULIA LEVEILLE
I’m Julia Leveille, a sophomore, and this is my first year on iGEM. I run cross country and track. I love reading and have green hair!
HANNA MINOT

LAUREN PAN
Hi, I'm one of the two ""Lauren""s on the Lambert HS iGEM team! (Though I am the one of the senior sort). I enjoy sunsets, long walks on the beach, and vortexers. I've done everything from HOSA, to Student Council, to FBLA and even Outdoor Adventure Club. But iGEM is truly where my heart lies.
SARAH RUPERT
Hi I'm Sarah, I'm a senior at Lambert High School. Since my freshman year when I realized mechanical engineering just wasn't my thing, I've had a passion for that of genetic engineering. iGEM has become my life, and my family.
NOOR SOHAL
Hi my name is Noor, I am a senior at Lambert High School. Freshman year I developed a love for synthetic biology, which I pursued through iGEM. Similar to my love for synthetic biology I adore sloths and think they are the greatest creatures to have ever existed. I hope to continue my love for synthetic biology and sloths throughout college and life.
KEVIN TAO
I am a current Junior at Lambert. I am involved with the band, iGem, and Hosa. I play tennis, piano, and the bass clarinet. I am mainly interested in biology and hope to go into the field of medicine.
ADVISORS
JANET STANDEVEN
Lover of science, bread baking, knitting, gardening and home design. Passionate about Synthetic Biology and open source science through iGEM. Mother of three wonderful sons, wife of a patient and generous husband and second mother to a generation of talented, inquisitive, intelligent and constantly hungry students.
SHELBY COCHRAN
My life is not my own, but that's the way I want it. My life belongs to the One who redeemed my soul, to my husband who stole my heart, to my parasitic offspring whom I adore and would sacrifice everything for, to my amazing students who keep me young. All I ask for is a small part of the day to release some endorphins in a thirty minute workout and a little bit of clean, iGEM green kale juice to keep me going!
BRITTNEY CANTRELL
If it involves coffee, campfires, tacos or dinosaurs, I'm in! A perfect day is one spent sharing my love for science with my freshmen who have affectionately been deemed my squirrels. Personal goals include turning all of my students into big ol' science nerds and continuing to travel. Free time is spent in the mountains hiking and backpacking with my sweet husband and two fur babies.

About the Team
The Vanderbilt iGEM team is made up of dedicated undergraduate students who have a passion for synthetic biology. We pride ourselves on being a independent research laboratory run by undergraduate students. In our lab, as long as you have a dash of creativity and a dedicated work ethic, then even as a student, you can take your ideas for biological inventions and make them into reality. It is a rare place where we as students can go all the way from the spark of an idea, to experimentation, to discovery.
Our members’ interests stretch from biological engineering to bioinformatics and biophysical modeling. We have come together this year as an interdisciplinary team, merging together ideas from the fields of biology, chemistry, computing, and mathematics, in order to develop the kind of innovative projects that are only possible with immersive collaborations.
Our team combines an interdisciplinary spirit with a desire to tackle the most difficult problems in biology. Each of us contributing our own expertise and interests,  we look for new ways to approach these problems. As our project this year embodies, we are not afraid to venture into the seemingly impossible, like the idea of using engineering to somehow fend off the process of DNA mutation and evolution. But the most important discoveries come from taking that leap of inspiration, and we as scientists and engineers at Vanderbilt iGEM are willing to take the chance to bring the field of synthetic biology one step farther.

About Us
Alexey Tomsov
”Captain Bold”
About me: “I’m 25 years old, born in Minsk, Belarus and raised in a small Israeli Town. I just finished my BSc. in Biotechnology and Food Engineering, with the intention  to open my own startup in the future. I love to laugh, listen to great music and have fun with my friends. I worked as a professional video editor in my past, I love working and managing creative projects”.
Alexey's role in project:  “Alexey is the producer of the project. Not only was the idea for the project something he originally suggested, but he could also be counted on to know largely what was going on with all the subgroups. Alexey was also the producer of all the videos which relate to our project and which can be found in the human practices section and main page of this wiki. Alexey also took part in the expression component of the project.
What makes you bold: “My out-of-the box thinking. Plus, I’m Russian”.
Yael Annis
“Ice Woman”
About me: “I’m 23 years old and was born in California, USA.  I moved to Israel 11 years ago.  I am now in my 4th and last year of my BSc. in Biotechnology and Food Engineering at Technion.  I love traveling and running.”
Yael’s part in wiki:  Yael worked together with Roni on the cofactor component of the project. She is also largely responsible for the content of this (awesome!) wiki.
What makes you bold: “My diligence”.
Tal Ofek
“Master Starter”
About me: “I’m 26 years old, just finished my Bachelor’s studies in Biotechnology and Food Engineering, and about to start my master’s degree at the same faculty, in the microbiology of pathogens lab. I love decorating cakes and swimming.”
Tal's role in project: Tal could almost always be found in the lab. She worked restlessly on the secretion component of our project, continuously trying and trying again when necessary.
What makes you bold: “Ctrl+b”
Roni Cohen
“PCR Princess”
About me: “I’m 26, and studying Biotechnology and Food Engineering because of my great passion for life science, combined with the fact that I'm kind of practical. I love to create - whether it's DIY arts&crafts or cooking in the kitchen (did anyone mention food science?!).”
Roni's role in project: Roni was another team member that could always be found in the lab. She worked non-stop on developing the cofactor for our project. The success seen in the results is largely credited to her perseverance even in the face of bad results.
What makes you bold: “I’m not afraid to speak my mind”
Adi Yannai
“Petri Girl”
About me: “I’m 26 years old, and I got married six months ago to the love of my life. I love to explore and discover new things in biology as part of my B.Sc. degree in Biotechnology and Food Engineering I just finished cum laude”
Adi’s role in the project: “Adi could always be counted on in the lab, working mostly on the expression component of our project. Adi's successes would never let us down and could never be confused with anyone else's- she showed expression blatantly by growing purple bacteria using the BBa_K1357008 BioBrick from the 2015 DNA Distribution Kit. Additionally, she was also on top of the requirements for the medals for the competition, as well as the relevant deadlines.”
What makes you bold: “My long hair”
Ruth Veksler
“The Sonicator”
About me: “I’m 24 year old, just finished my B.Sc. in Biochemical Engineering and looking forward to start working as an engineer and exploring new challenges in places where biology meets engineering. ”
Ruth’s part in the project: Our project would have been a lot messier without Ruth.  Ruth worked on the secretion part of our project, but was also in charge of the lab.  We would never be kept waiting more than a few minutes for the necessary materials, and her expertise in various protocols made her the go-to person for most questions we had.
What makes you bold: “Stay calm and pipette on”.
Liron Abrahami
“Primer-dimer”
About me: “ I’m 26 year old, starting my fourth and last year in my Bachelor’s studies in Biotechnology and Food Engineering I love art as well as science so I hope that in the future I will be able to combine both. ”
Liron’s role in the project:  Liron was not only a part of the group working on the secretion project, she was also our own personal designer...for everything! Our shirts, poster, wiki, and Powerpoint presentation would have been extremely boring in comparison, if not for Liron's fantastic artistic skills.
What makes you bold: “I look at a problem as a challenge”
Sagi Sheinkman
“Super 3D”
About me: “I’m 22, just had my M.Sc. seminar - the team’s mechanical engineer. I studied mechanical engineering at the material and deposits department, and my thesis talks about the mutual effects between dislocations. Vegetarian, love running, indie music, and good people.”
Sagi’s role in the project: Sagi joined our team later on, but definitely pulled his weight in helping us develop the comb. The comb and syringe, along with their uniform distribution properties, is largely thanks to Sagi's help.
What makes you bold: “First of all - my beard. Then my super-fun charisma and modesty. But seriously, my family.”
Maayan Lufton
“Comb Whisperer”
About me: “I’m 25 years old and just finished my BSc. in Chemical Engineering. I’m a really happy person who loves to laugh, go out and have fun. One of my favorite things is to arrange events down to the smallest detail!
Maayan's role in the project:  Maayan was our poster child for human practices and collaborations. She constantly took initiative, teaching the course we gave to the Technion high school team and planning the Mini-Jamboree. She also worked restlessly on developing the comb.  The comb would not have been possible without her perseverance.
What makes you bold: “Standing in front of a crowd”
Nitzan Shmuel
“The flash”
About me: “I’m 26, on the last year of my BSc. in Electrical Engineering. I love to travel, photograph beautiful shots, and listen to great music (metal). ”
Nitzan’s role in the project: Nitzan was the mastermind behind our model and wiki. Having more extensive experience in coding than the rest of our team, he set up the basics for the website, as well as the fancier components such as the dropdown menu and the homepage. In parallel, he worked on a complex model, always taking him further and further into the bolts and cofactors of the biology behind our project.
What makes you bold: “My ability to skip sleeping”

Notre Equipe
Vous voilà au bon endroit pour découvrir notre joyeuse équipe de dix étudiants  et nos formidables instructeurs ! Nous étudions tous à Toulouse, mais dans des domaines différents. Six d’entre  nous sont élèves ingénieurs en 4ème de Génie Biochimique à l’INSA, tandis que  les autres finissent leur première année de Master à l’Université Paul Sabatier,  deux en Microbiologie, et deux en Bioinformatique.  Nous considérons nos formations variées comme une grande force pour l’équipe :  c’est en utilisant les compétences de chacun que nous parviendrons à faire  d’ApiColi le meilleur projet possible.  Et si nous différons par nos choix de spécialisation, nous partageons les mêmes  motivations profondes en ce qui concerne notre participation à l’iGEM : notre  amour des sciences, et notre volonté de participer à l’avancement de la biologie  synthétique. A travers cette belle opportunité qu’est l’iGEM, nous souhaitons  apprendre toujours plus, mais également transmettre et partager.

Our Team
Here is the place for you to get acquainted with our happy (api !?) team of ten students and our wonderful instructors ! Though we all study in Toulouse, we have different fields of expertise. In fact, six of us study Biochemical Engineering at INSA, while the others are in the first year of their Master’s degree at Paul Sabatier University, two in Microbiology and two in Bioinformatics.  The fact that our fields of study are varied is a great force for our team. It is only by using each member’s personal skills that we will be able to make ApiColi the greatest project. And moreover, in what matters, we are alike and share the same motivations as to our iGEM participation : our love of science and will to take part in the advancement of synthetic biology. We want to learn, again and again, and share through our first international experience.

The iGEM competition is an enriching experience in our student life, and thanks to this competition we gained a lot of important skills.  As we needed to find sponsors we became experts in phone harassment. We also needed to communicate about our project and learned to make visiting cards, newsletters. We also became experts at explaining our project and synthetic biology to the general public. Moreover we had to get in touch with different people such as administrators, scientists, beekeepers, specialists, an ethical expert and other iGEM teams and learned a lot through these interactions.
In this part, we want to thank all the persons who contributed to our project by sharing their experience, their knowledge, and their interest.
General support
Our thanks to:
M. Brice Enjalbert for leading the project, for his advice and his availability.
All our advisors who helped us develop our ideas during the brainstorming, and volunteered their knowledge of synthetic biology, microbiology...
The LISBP that gave us full access to the lab and the material we needed, allowing us to work under very good conditions all through the summer.
Our sponsors, for the financial support that enabled us to give reality to our project.
M. Thierry Dufresne (Observatoire Français d’Apidologie), and M. Yves Leconte (INRA Avignon) for all their references in the field of beekeeping, bees and varroas.
M. Vincent Grégoire-Delory, Mrs Anne Cambon-Thomsen and Simon Desbois who were with us throughout our ethical thinking process and thus helped us build the foundations of our project.
A special thank to Pierrick Montagne, Gilles Truan and Théo Depresle for their beautiful pictures, your skill in capturing moments are amazing.
Project support
To implement our project, we needed to understand the functioning of a beehive and the bees behaviour. Christian Boucher is a researcher from a famous French lab and has some beehives. He agreed to meet us and was able to inform us about bees and to advise us on the molecular biology part of our project. He was a helpful link between bees and biology, and we thank him for his availability.
We owe M. Gilles Truan our deepest gratitude for his availability, and his unreserved support on synthetic biology and genetic regulation.
To analyse the supernatant of our cultures (and particularly to try to detect our compounds of interest), we used the Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) of the Metatoul platform. We would like to thank them warmly for making this state-of-the-art technology available to us.
Also thanks to Mrs Lindsay Peyriga, who showed our team members how to correctly prepare NMR samples, how to run acquisitions and helped them with the interpretation of the results.
Attract support
We based part of our strategy on the demonstration made in the US8647615 patent that butyric acid has an attractant power towards varroas. We thus decided to design the butyrate production pathway for our attraction module, and we acknowledge that this disables us from commercializing our project.
To design the butyrate production pathway, we met with M. Philippe Soucaille, teacher at the engineering school INSA and researcher who shared his experience in metabolic engineering.
Special thanks to Mrs Angélique Vétillard and her PhD student Vincent Piou from the laboratory Vacbio EA 4357 linked to the University Jean François Champollion for their warm welcome in their lab to experiment varroa attraction and eradication.
M. Patrick Chekroun for the realization of the T-tube test we designed to experiment varroa attraction at the Vacbio laboratory.
Eradicate support
To design the eradication module of our genetic system, we met with Mrs Nathalie Gorret who gave us interesting information about pflA and pflB genes. Moreover, we wanted our bacteria to survive during two weeks but did not know how to proceed. Mrs Gorret was the one who first talked to us about the BioSilta kit.
Regulation support
Our regulation module contains Cph8 and PCB receptors. We received the Material Transfer Agreement (MTA) from Clark Lagarias and following the indications of Christopher Voigt laboratory, we received the strain containing those receptors from Dr Nico Claasens (Wageningen University). Thank you very much for allowing us to develop our module.
Optimization support
Thank you to Mrs Stéphanie Heux for her personal investment in our project: she provided her bacterial growth and modeling expertise to Laetitia and Mélany.  We contacted a specialized company called BioSilta that designs growth systems, and used their kit “EnPresso B Defined Nitrogen-free” in order to optimize the growth and production of our bacteria in our system. Special thanks to Antje Neubauer who took the time to skype with us to advise us.
Trap support
The creation of our trap would not have been possible without:
Benoît Pons who designed the trap.
M. Valentin Girin who created the trap on Catia software.
M. Philippe Seitier from Mechanical Department of INSA who printed our trap with a 3D printer.
The technician who created a little hive entrance to show the trap in its natural environment.
Our trap contains a TPX bag  that prevents bacteria from going out. This special plastic was given by Mitsui Chemicals and the idea came from the project of Groenigen iGEM team in 2012.
Fundraising help
Our thanks to Mrs Hélène Baron, representative of Midi-Pyrénées region in Brussels, and M. Claudes Maranges, who helped us by giving us new lines of search for sponsoring.
Lab support
We would like to address our special thanks to all the researchers who gave us crucial strains and plasmids for our ApiColi project. All the strains were Escherichia coli strains:
Gilles Truan (LISBP-EAD11): DH5 alpha
Stéphanie Heux (LISBP-EAD6): BW25113, MG1663, and two strains with an acetate deletion : Delta pta and Delta ackA (keio strain)
Kaymeuang Cam (UPS/CNRS UMR5089): MG1655 and MC1661
Mathieu Fournié (LISBP- Unit EAD11): K823022
We thank Marie Bouvier and Carine Pagès from the “Laboratoire de Microbiologie et Génétique Moléculaires” who kindly gave us plasmids, which unfortunately we did not use due to lack of time.
Mrs Florence Bordes helped us with her high spirits and technical advice during all the project.
M. Thomas Lautier helped and gave us advice during the brainstorming and then particularly for two weeks when all the lab was closed because of holidays.
Mrs Fayza Daboussi, who can be counted on during lab holidays to help and motivate us.
M. Yves Dutruy and Mrs Sylvie Cancel, the lab technicians, who gave us material and advice.
Project advisors
Brice Enjalbert, our main advisor. He supervised the project from February to September. Thanks for giving us the management project tricks.
Gilles Truan, our scientific project manager. He brought to the team his skills and background about the competition and synthetic biology. Thank you for your support and help.
Florence Bordes, our technical molecular biology support.
Mathilde Beraud is the youngest of the advisors, and she dedicated her experience, her calm and her communication skills to the project, in order to defend it or search for financial support. She took part in the optimization of experiments, and kept an eye on the project management. She contributed to our magnificent poster which you will be able to see on our stand in Boston. To sum up, she is like a mother to our group.
Kaymeuang Cam, Thomas Lautier, Stéphanie Heux, Marie-Line Daveran-Mingot, Fayza Daboussi, Eliane Meilhoc, Mathieu Fournié, César Aceves, …
Wiki support
Our friends and teammates Mélany Tanchon and Louise Gody are studying bioinformatics at the University Paul Sabatier of Toulouse, and they were able to create and to upload all the wiki. We thank them for their heavy and time-consuming work.
Thanks to OS Templates .
Presentation coaching
During one week, we worked very hard on our presentation. Every morning, our speakers gave a practice presentation in front of our advisors and we would like to address special thanks to Brice Enjalbert, Gilles Truan, Stéphanie Heux, Florence Bordes, Eliane Meilhoc, César Aceves, Thomas Lautier, Mathilde Béraud, and Kaymeuang Cam.
Human Practices support
Mrs Joy Cozar (INSA), Estelle Brucale (INSA), Virginie Fernandez (UPS) who helped us on communication aspects, and graciously contributed goodies for the events in which we took part.
A lot of different local newspapers were interested in ApiColi. In this part, we would like to thank all the journalists that came to meet us:
Axelle Szczygiel for her article in the newspaper Métronews
Hélène Ménal for her article in the newspaper 20 Minutes
Léa Maarek for her article in the newspaper La Dépêche
Philippe Passebon and Juliette Raynal for their article in the magazine Industrie et Technologie
Bruno Declairieux for his article in the magazine Capital.
Mrs Maryline Desjours gave us the opportunity to defend our project in ESI Brussels.
M. Bernard Valéro, the French ambassador in Belgium took the time to listen to us explaining our project during Exposciences International.
A big thank you to all the iGEM teams we collaborated with: KU Leuven, Vilnius, Eindhoven, Ankara, Amoy, Paris Saclay, CGU. Our thanks to Bordeaux iGEM Team invited us to the iGEM meetup France, which enabled us to discover other projects, and have other teams vision of our own. We also had the opportunity of giving a presentation at Capsciences, their partner, in front of an audience composed of the other teams and members of their crew.
Bros communication: They kindly created the design of our visiting cards and the design of the poster we presented at Exposciences International in Brussels.
Thanks and acknowledgements to all the other people who dedicated some time in order to make our iGEM experience a great one
We thank everyone who has contributed in some way to the project, thanks for the help and encouragement that made our project an unforgettable adventure.
Finally, we would like to acknowledge all of our team members: Laetitia Chaumont, Anthony David Mélissa David, Thomas Etcheberry, Louise Gody, Alexandre Le Scornet, Benoît Pons, Marine Pons, Mélany Tanchon, and Blandine Trouche. We worked hard on our wonderful project during all summer and we successfully created a very good atmosphere!
Laetitia Chaumont
Laetitia is the strong link of the team. She first came up with the wonderful idea of this project because her mother experiences troubles with varroas. She is able to take on impressive quantities of work and stay effective. Thanks to her, we studied bacterial growth, NMR analysis, in silico modeling, cloning… everything! Moreover, she is one of the main members responsible for the ethics part of the project, which gives it a real asset.
Anthony David
Anthony is the pastry chef of the team. Besides his cooking skills, he designed all the biobricks sequences: gene optimization, and Serial Cloner software were his friends for many days. During our wet lab period, when we needed any help, he was always ready to assist. He created the wonderful PowerPoint presentation you will see in Boston… so do not hesitate to come take a look at our presentation, because it’s a real treat for the eye!
Mélissa David
Mélissa played a big part in making this project possible: she is often glued to her laptop or phone to contact sponsors or realize quotes about the goodies we will have in our stand. She is responsible for all the events we took and will take part in, and she represented us at International ExpoSciences. Finally, she teamed up with Alexandre on the parts submission, helping him with the PCR.
Thomas Etcheberry
Thomas is our humoristic koala, responsible for the good mood in the team. He has some ability with the English language, that’s why he took care of the international communication. He found great prices for the flight and a place to live in Boston. In the wet lab, he was very busy but he was particularly dedicated to perform butyrate cloning and study. Then, he was a strong support for Wiki coding when our IT expert was sick or absent !
Louise Gody
Louise, our artist and wiki master… Without her, we could never have had this amazing logo, nor all these illustrations that you can see on our wiki, poster and presentation. With her massive work, she made the science more attractive and above all unique. In the wiki, she is responsible for the architecture, design, and simplicity. Even if she spends a lot of time on her computer, she does not forget the experiments.
Alexandre Le Scornet
Alexandre is the coffee addict: he is the first to arrive in the morning, to turn on the Biological Safety Cabinet and… the coffee-maker. He can do all kinds of stuff, either in the wet lab or on his laptop. He realized a collaboration with the Eindhoven team, but his biggest work was with our biobricks. Indeed, he is the part submission responsible, and took care of the biobricks validity. He filled the register and sent all the parts to iGEM. If you want to see him, he will present our project during the Giant Jamboree.
Benoît Pons
Benoît is the youngest of the team, and is partner in crime with Thomas on the bad jokes. He is a jack of all trades in the lab: autoclave, mediums, cloning, culture… they hold no secrets to him. Besides his hyperactivity, he took care of all the communication, being the link between the press and us. Moreover he is a great speaker, and will present our project in Boston with Alexandre and Blandine.
Marine Pons
Marine is our mister freeze addict. She is the iGEM association president, but mostly a great scientist with strong knowledge in bacterial genetics: she is the leader for the wet lab, managing all the experiments to do. She has huge responsibilities and leads this project with skill. She had the idea to use a circadian regulation and designed all the genetic regulation of ApiColi.
Mélany Tanchon
Melany is our bioinformatics specialist, author of all the modeling done in this project. Without this real asset, we could not compare experimental results with theory, and have an idea of its feasibility. She developed a modeling collaboration with Leuven team, but also created our wiki with Louise. Finally she teamed up with Thomas to clone on the butyrate pathway.
Blandine Trouche
Blandine is an essential member of the team because of her role: indeed, she is the iGEM treasurer and manages our finances which are limited. She gave her help where it was needed in the experiments, she also realized a collaboration with Ankara team and was our very own French/English  translator and reviewer. She represented us during the meetup France in Bordeaux, and will continue to defend the project in Boston, presenting it alongside Alexandre and Benoît.

About Taipei American School
Taipei American School is a private independent school with an American-based curriculum located in Tianmu (T'ien-mu), Shilin District (Shih-lin), Taipei City. Most graduates of TAS go on to attend colleges and universities in United States, although some choose to attend schools in other countries. TAS strives to stay ahead of the curve in STEAM education. An important aspect of STEAM education is the 'E': Engineering. Our iGEM team represents the application of engineering beyond robotics.
About The Lab
We work in the Sandy R. Puckett Memorial Research Lab, which was completely renovated in 2013 to provide a research laboratory for on-campus student research in synthetic biology and nanotechnology. It is fully equipped with lab tools for research for the iGEM competition. The students have the opportunity to be creative and exploratory in many areas of scientific research at TAS.
Synthetic Biology
The fusion between biological research and engineering has culminated in the creation of synthetic biology. This interdisciplinary area was facilitated by the recent advances in technology, allowing humans to actually design and construct biological devices as if they were machinery. However, the advent of synthetic biology has raised concerns with biosafety and biosecurity, which is why iGEM places such importance on ""safety""."

Teamwork occurs when diverse abilities and insights join together to work towards a common goal.  Therefore, students of different age, gender and field of study came together to found our team in Aachen. During the project we not only had the chance to learn from each other, but also to excel ourselves.  So all in all with joint forces and collective creativity, we will create something special in order to make our contribution to synthetic biology.

After completing the third semester in Biotechnology at the RWTH Aachen, I decided to take a semester off to participate  in the iGEM competition. I heard about iGEM in a lecture and found the aspects of synthetic biology and the possibility to be part of a self-managed, independent student reasearch team very appealing. Looking back, I really learned a lot, not only about labwork and designing experiments, but also about teamwork and communicating synthetic biology to the public. All in all it was a great semester and although it was stressful at times, I really enjoyed being part of the iGEM competition.

I first got in touch with the iGEM competition when a couple of my friends founded the first iGEM Aachen team in 2014. Back then I was busy with my bachelor thesis so I couldn't participate but I already knew that I would join the next team if there was one.
So I ended up in this years team and I didn't get disappointed - meeting new people and working together on a great project was a lot of fun. Besides iGEM I like to spent my free time with good fantasy book or movie.

I participated in the iGEM competition to get new experiences in the field of sythetic biology because it is a very fascinating and exciting topic in my studies for me. Therefore, I took a study semester off to concentrate completely on the new challenge. During the iGEM project I have learned to design several experiments and to do different kinds of work in the lab. I also gained experiences in presenting a project to an audience and countless more. These experiences will influence my future academic studies. In my spare time I do gymnastics and I have successfully been doing Cyr Wheel for 2 years winning the silver medal at the world championships 2015.

Besides my master's studies in Biology at RWTH Aachen University I wanted to learn more about project management and working in a self-organizing team of students. The iGEM competition and the iGEM Team Aachen are the right opportunity to seize it. Learning more about the experiment design and data analysis was great. It was also a great experience to see and get the support of the people from the different institutes, which were not directly involved in our iGEM project. In my free time I like to go swimming and participate in debates at the university's debating club (the latter happens to seldom due to iGEM and my studies, unfortunately).

""Everything happens for a reason"". I studied Electronics and Communication Engineering for bachelors and disliked it for most of the 4 years. Finally I got a chance to study Biomedical Engineering in Aachen, which brings me closer to my areas of interest.  When I heard about the iGEM competition, it matched perfectly with the kind of biological laboratory experience I was looking for. But with the first team meeting, being singled out as one of the 2 engineers, I set out to help with building up on the last year's OD/F device, to begin with, and then to build a DIY, mini scale bioreactor and thereby never reached the biology laboratory. Nevertheless it was fun, and much, much more.

The studies of electrical engineering are quiet theoretical, so for a long time I wanted to do something practical. Than I came across iGEM competition from a neighbour and was fascinated about the possibility to do some practical work in a scientific context and, even more, think outside the box of my subject and explore things far beyond. But fast I realized that there are many connections between biology and electrical engineering, problems that none of the subjects can solve on its own but that we will work on together. And therefor it is common opportunities. This is what makes iGEM such a great matter to me.

After completing my third semester I wanted to get into the lab and use synthetic biology to build something new. For that reason, I dedicated my entire summer term to our iGEM project.  Over the past few months I was able to contribute to a diverse field of work and enjoyed working in a team of complementary strengths. I particularly enjoyed the exchange with other iGEMers and supporters. Besides my studies I am interested in cooking and city travels.

I completed my undergrad degree in biotechnology at FH Aachen University and wrote my bachelor thesis about: ""Characterization of an anti-Muc1 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)"" at the Center for Molecular Medicine Cologne. For me participating in the iGEM is a great opportunity to look beyond the horizon. To handle our own research project we have to take various tasks into consideration: fundraising, labwork, public relations and many others. For me this complexity made iGEM so exciting!  In my free time I love spending time with my friends and sailing at the Rursee.

This is my second year within the iGEM community. I am still fascinated by synthetic biology and the possibility to realize a research project from scratch to finalization within an interdisciplinary team.  Based on the experience gained through our first participation in the iGEM competition I wanted to help this year's team to perform even better and to prevent some of the mistakes we did in our first year. Besides participating in iGEM I work as a student assistant at the RWTH Aachen's Institute for Molecular Biotechnology (BIO VII). In my student assistant job I am mainly involved in the purification of plant made biopharmaceuticals from tobacco. In my spare time I like to do sports such as Volleyball and Badminton.

Fascinated by natural sciences I participated in different international science competitions during my school time because spreading innovative ideas to the public always seemed important to me in case of advancing solutions for challanges of our society. My enthusiasm of natural sciences, the chance to improve my soft skills and learn new scientific hard skills within the great atmosphere of an interdisciplinary student team have mainly motivated me to participate in the iGEM competition 2015. In my opinion my iGEM experiences have offered me interesting insights in biochemistry, synthetic biology and correlated lab work that I would not have learned in my chemical studies. The combination of exciting wetlab experience, weekly English team meetings, the possibility to creatively get involved in diverse sub topics e.g. fundraising, design tasks or public relations is shortly summarized that was iGEM is about based on my experiences. These key possibilities together with my great team members have resulted in one year of hard work as well as pleasure to me. I am sure that these experiences are going to support my future work as a chemist. As a balance to my research work I like to spend time with my family and go on bicycle or jogging adventures with friends in nature.

When last years iGEM competition was over, I decided to take part for a second time before proceeding with my master studies. In 2014 we had done some mistakes when it came to project management and learned a lot. So early into this years project, I focused on our internal infrastructure and became responsible for teaching our new team members what's important in iGEM and how synthetic biology works in the lab.

During my studies I realized that I like to challenge myself and dig into new topics. Therefore I took a varity of course and challenged myself to get an understanding in the different fields of biology, chemistry, physics and informatics. I soon found interdisciplinary sciences to combine the different topics to create incredible solutions for the problems of our time. Until my first contact with the synthetic biology, I worked in biomimetics, taking courses, programming genetic algorithms and even doing my bachelor thesis in this field. When I heard about the iGEM project, I participated because it is not only interdisciplinary, but also allows students to develope their own project. Our Instructor and Advisor are always willing to answer our questions but also give us the freedom to work independently on our project. Therefore, everyone makes incredible valuable experiences. I personally focused on coordinations and colaborations, learning not only about synthetic biology but also about important softskills.

My name is Laura and I major in Molecular and Applied Biotechnology at RWTH Aachen.  During my third semester I learned about iGEM and was fascinated by the possibility to plan and execute an independent scientific project in the early phase of my studies. Therefore, I took a semester off to join the team Aachen.  For me the project was a great opportunity to share my ideas with other motivated students, to profit from their diverse abilities and to have a great summer. By now I can say that I learned a lot about designing experiments and working in the lab, but also about organizing a team and how to present synthetic biology to the public. In my free time, I like to do sports, especially playing golf. Apart from that, I enjoy reading a thrilling book or cooking with friends.

Last year I did my Bachelor Thesis at the ""Institute of Applied Microbiology"" (iAMB) in ""Developing an E. coli expression system for high throughput analysis"". The same year, we founded and run the first iGEM Team of Aachen with the project ""Cellock Holmes - A Case of Identity"". In October I will be starting the 2. year of my master studies of Molecular and Applied Biotechnology. The iGEM experience 2014 was so overwhelming that I had to be part of it once more! I felt obliged to help the next team, but got so excited about the new project and team that I became a member again. The opportunity to manage such a huge and diverse project in combination with the work in a multinational, interdisciplinary team is what fascinates me the most. Similar to last year, I mainly focus on communication, presentation and coordination. Apart from the iGEM work, I like to ride my bike, enjoy a nice match of Tennis and love to go dancing with my girlfriend.

After three semesters of theoretical studies of Biotechnology in Aachen, it was perfectly time to gain some practical experiences for me. Thus, having a great summer with an iGEM project, together with many motivated students was the perfect opportunity. It sounds like a cliché, but I learned much more in this very intense time than I ever expected.  It was awesome to experience team work in an interdisciplinary group and to get in contact with iGEM members from other towns. When I'm not doing iGEM stuff, I do sports, make cakes, dance and meet my friends outside the laboratory.

our indian workaholic, ladiesman
Being a student of Electronics and Instrumentation from India, I came here to Germany to study Biomedical Engineering because of my facination towards medical and biological instruments. During my Bioinformatics Lecture one day I was introduced to the plan and the idea of iGEM. The one thing that made me join this team was the fact that I could use my own ideas and work on Biological Instruments. This great opportunity helped me develop hardware and software. Learning and working with theories and plans outside the box is what I am good at because I have always been involved in practical hardware projects. Hardware circuit designing and interfacing with software and arduino firmware is always complicated, this makes it much more fun to integrate and compensate the electronics by burning or in technical terms ""overheating"" the system. While building this Bioreactor I learned that sometimes burning circuits helps you to understand which is the correct way and which is not.

I am working as a Subgroup Leader in Prof. Schwaneberg research group at the Institute of Biotechnology, RWTH Aachen. The research area of the Schwaneberg group focuses on directed protein evolution by developing novel methods for generating diversity at the gene level, analyzing consequences of mutational biases on the protein level and developing novel high-throughput screening systems that will lead to improved biocatalysts for prominent applications in industry.
In particular, my core expertise is development of high throughput screening systems for different enzyme classes in order to redefine the screening step no longer as bottleneck in directed evolution.In iGEM, I enjoyed very much to work with highly motivated and ambitious young scientists from RWTH Aachen University. I truly believe that our collaboration has just started and that we will enjoy jointly solving the scientific challenges in the near future.

I joined the lab of Prof. Lars Blank at RWTH Aachen University in September 2012, for my post-doctoral research on investigating the glycerol metabolism in E. coli for bio-product synthesis. During my Ph.D, I worked under the guidance of Prof. Andreas Schmid (2008-2012) at TU Dortmund, and Prof. Matthias Reuss (2009-2011) at the University of Stuttgart, with a focus on elucidating the link between the central and aromatic metabolism of P. putida using a systems biology approach.
I'm fascinated about understanding the collective dynamic behavior of microorganisms and their metabolic potential in different niches. Hence to decipher the metabolic dynamics, I use the tools of metabolic engineering & systems biology such as metabolomics, fast sampling, kinetic/dynamic modeling and metabolic flux analysis.In iGEM, I enjoy working with a group of young scientists from Aachen to achieve our common goal enabling bacteria to grow on methanol and accumulate glycogen. Besides science, I try to get myself involved in adventurous sports...but honestly... I just like to relax my day with a delicious meal and a good sci-fi movie! ;-)

The team Shiyan_SY_China constitutes by our nine students and five tutors such as Dr. Xu Mingkai to instruct and help us. Some of us own deep interest in biology, some are enthusiastic about mathematics, some are interested in music and sports, also some are experts at making the software and studying intensively. We utilize our curiosity and energy to construct our team. Thanks to all the people who have helped us, without them, we couldn’t explore a new and interesting field.
I am Chu Jinyan,I participate in the iGEM for challenging myself to form my leadership and to achieve some first hand experiences about biology experiments and software making. Due to the admiration of doing experiments, I own the desire to be a scientist. I am the leader of students group and the administrator of the software part in our team, and also a participator of the biology experiment.
I am Liu Yiyang, one of the members of the Shenyang_SY_China team and the leader of the experiment group in our team. As I have great enthusiasm in Biology and want to achieve more knowledge about gene engineering, I take part in the IGEM. I love Biology so much that I decide to devote my lifetime to experiments and research.I learn a lot about teamwork and confirm my will to dedicate to Biology.
My dream is to be a scientist in the future because I really love chemistry and biology. From my perspective, the coolest thing of science is that I can obtain much knowledge about the nature through experiments and studies. In our team, I take charge of the experimental parts with three other team members. I learned a lot from the lab and I plan to try to have more opportunities to study in chemistry or biology labs.
I'm doing iGEM because I can develop some interests. I'm interested in biology and chemistry. I love doing experiments. I think I can achieve more experience in iGEM. I can have more friends with the same interest, and I learn how to work with others.I love drawing and dancing and insist in doing them.In our group, I am responsible for experiments and art designing.In the future, I want to be a scientist.
I am Chen Sijian. By joining the IGEM competition, I hope that my programming skills, html and javascrip, will be developed.Second, my interest and dream is to construct robots which bases on the solid foundation of programming.Resulting from the reason above,I think that I am supposed to attend the competition.I am the website engineer of our team.I would like to be a website engineer in the future.
At the beginning, I was very interested in computer programming as well as this group lack of this kind of talents. I joined IGEM competition.Although I would sacrifice my entertainment time, I could exercise myself and do one’s bit for group. Regard to auspices, I know I need to positive to contact other people and sometimes I would suffer some difficulties. But I will overcome it and to achieve fund for the group.
Jiacong Gu, the art editor of our team SHIYAN_SY_CHINA. I'm responsible for designing promotional posters as well as doing art-related work which is my ideal things to do in the future. To strengthen friendship with other team members, to promote my own skills during cooperation and to acquire the inspiration brought by combination of science and art are what I hope to gain from attending this competition.
Thanks to iGEM, I can further develop my interests about html. Besides, I have also received social practical experience during the process of promoting iGEM to the public, which is the reason for me to join the iGEM competition.I'm in charge of making parts of the team's home page. Moreover, I am also be responsible for the promotion of the iGEM to the public.As a high school student, I want to choose programming related major in my college study.
Hi, I am Pai Qu from Liaoning Province Shiyan High school. The first time I heard about iGEM and Synthetic Biology was when my friend was promoting the iGEM a few months ago. Although I had always been weak in Biology in school, I had to admit that Synthetic Biology was attractive and iGEM was a cool platform to learn and compete. Therefore, I joined this team.I am responsible for the things beside the Biology such as the making of the wiki.

We really appreciate LZU-China’s help in 2015’s iGEM competition. LZU-China is a team supported by Lanzhou University which is the best university in the northwestern region of China, ranking as one of the top 30 among over 1,500 universities across China. And they have taken part in the last 2 years’ iGEM competition. This year, they mentored us and shared their competition experience with us. They provide many valuable suggestions which are about the presentation, the wiki design and the parts construction.
For example, they provided many useful advises for the construction of parts. We are HS team so that we do not have much experience in genetic engineering. LZU-China helped us to solve many problems we met like selecting the clone, assembling the plasmid.
What’s more, they pointed an important mistake for us, which made us avoid adding a wrong part, and told us many things about the part shipping. We completed the part submission form with their assistance. They helped to choose the suitable Part ID and told us how to fill in the Registry.
We are particularly grateful to International Teenage Competition and Communication Center (ITCCC). Dr. Mao Yong helped us to understand match process and how to enter for it in our preparatory phase. And igem team from Tianjing University, which presented handbook to us by post.

Attributions
Each team must clearly attribute work done by the student team members on this page. The team must distinguish work done by the students from work done by others, including the host labs, advisors, instructors, and individuals not on the team roster.
Can we base our project on a previous one?
Yes! You can have a project based on a previous team, or based on someone else's idea, as long as you state this fact very clearly and give credit for the original project.
Why is this page needed?
The Attribution requirement helps the judges know what you did yourselves and what you had help with. We don't mind if you get help with difficult or complex techniques, but you must report what work your team did and what work was done by others.
For example, you might choose to work with an animal model during your project. Working with animals requires getting a license and applying far in advance to conduct certain experiments in many countries. This is difficult to achieve during the course of a summer, but much easier if you can work with a postdoc or PI who has the right licenses.
What should this page have?

hello. we’re SKLBC_CHINA
WE ARE A TEAM
Our group is consisted of 11 students from top high schools and middle schools. We were instructed by several PhDs of various fields from Sun Yat-sen University, which is a top 10 university in China, taking interdisciplinary courses such as programming, graphic design, and speech skills. Admittedly, given our academic backgrounds as high school students, it was financially and academically difficult for us to carry out an excellent experimental project as collegiate wet teams did. Therefore, we chose software track in iGEM this year and put our emphasis on human practice and educational outreaching to help improve iGEM wet teams’ working efficiency as well as extend the social influence of synthetic biology. At our first acquaintance, all we knew about each other was that we shared the same curiosity on biology and pursued for the same goal. Motivated by the same ambition, we worked together and gradually grew into a powerful and unbreakable team. This summer is the harvest season for us all. Not only did we complete a project that seemed extremely tough for us at the beginning, but we acquired knowledge that we may have never dabbled in before. Most unforgettably, we have been through the most brilliant summer in our lives with the precious and ever-lasting friendship among our team members and our mentors. Starting from scratch, we were on the way. The initial experience was delicate yet amazing. Strangers sat in a small room, saying hello to others with bit of timidity, pretending to focus on other stuffs, but couldn’t help chit-chatting with the person sitting nearby when typing on the laptops. Step by step, we gained knowledge, developed skills, and finally got to understand each other from the deep of our hearts. Together, we shared happiness and sorrow, gave our hands to one another when needed, and surmounted all the barriers, including stress that seemingly impossible for us to confront with such courage,  on our way. Eventually, we became an inseparable team. It’s wonderful and ineffable to stand at this point and retrospect the days we had struggled yet stuck tightly together. Still on the way, we struggled for an unpredictable future, an alluring dream. During the incipient months, we merely had a vague picture of our project and limited communication with each other. In turn, our project was proceeded really slowly back then. In the summer vacation, we lived together for ten days, with an immature project at the very beginning. But nothing could prevent us from achieving our dream. We searched for courses and tried frequently to get better visual effects of graphic designs because we were not adepts at it initially. None of us are native English speakers, so we had to practice for the presentations repeatedly while constantly modify the prototype of our project. We are a team. There were also moments when we argued because of divergences; there were moments when we jumped into the swimming pool together and enjoyed the relaxing atmosphere after a whole day’s exhausting but joyful work; there were also moments when some of us could not bear the pressure and cried secretly, but fortunately, received the comfort and encouragement from the rest of the team. No matter what we have encountered, joy or sorrow, victory or defeat, we always took it as a possibility to share our views and consummate our project. We are a team. It’s hard ever to imagine the long struggling way without any single person in this team. We are a team. It will never be a whole if anyone is absent. We are a Team. Thanks to everyone’s effort and contribution.

The University of Sydney iGEM team is forever indebted to numerous people for their contribution, support, and wisdom in our project.
First and foremost, we must thank our wonderful supervisor, Dr Nicholas Coleman for his tireless advice and guidance. From answering hundreds of emails at all hours of the night to keeping calm and carrying on when eight continuous PCRs failed, his support and direction has been phenomenal. Additionally, as the only Sydney academic actively engaged with the iGEM competition, without his supervision it is likely the Sydney iGEM team would have degraded after the first year. For this, all Sydney iGEMers - past, present and future are grateful.
A special thank you to Elissa Liew our advisor who helped our team navigate the lab and for always keeping one eye on us to ensure we did not make any mistakes.
To all past Sydney iGEMers from 2013 and 2014 for their advice and assurance when things went wrong. In particular to Robbie Oppenheimer, the founder of iGEM at Sydney University for his help with Strange Nature and for continuing to promote iGEM across Australia. Additionally, to Abi and Andy from the 2014 team for organising our team and sharing a lab bench.
Thanks to Dr Sandro Ataide and Professor Joel Mackay for your expert advice on modelling.
In terms of financial support, thank you to Profressor Trevor Hambley (Dean of the Faculty of Science), Professor Ian Campbell (Head of the School of Molecular Bioscience), and the Deputy Vice-Chancellor for Research . Additionally, thank you to Diagnostic Technology and New England Biolabs for providing essential equipment. Thanks to the generous contribution from GeneTex which helped cover the finances of the laboratory. Finally, thank you to Moelis & Company for their fantastic support.
Furthermore, to the Snapgene team for allowing access to their program for free, it was an invaluable tool for planning our project. To Integrated DNA Technologies and Agilent Technologies for providing us and other iGEM teams extensive G-Blocks and a SureVector kit for free. Your worldwide support for undergraduate research in this field is invaluable and greatly appreciated. Additionally, thank you to Bioline for providing necessary laboratory equipment.
We would also like to express our appreciation and thank Mr Peter Miller and the Alexandria Park Community School in entrusting the education of their students to a group of university students. We appreciate the dedication of their normal class time for us. We really appreciate the level of trust that they put towards the event.
Additionally, we must extend our graditude to the organisers of Science in the Swamp , Rotary Clubs, and members of the JAMS association for their help with our various outreach events.
Finally, to the magical Ajantha Abey, Lucy Zhang, and Soe Htet Aung for your help and support."

Lizzie - Guardian of the Team
Lizzie is in her third year of a Bachelor of Science and Arts degree, majoring in Molecular Biology and Genetics, Ancient History, and Performance Studies. She is aware this combination is extremely strange but sees it as a safety net as she figuratively has one foot in every corner (well third), so if one thing fails she has backups. She would like to pursue a career in synthetic biology focusing on agriculture and food production to help decrease the level of malnutrition and food insecurity in developing countries. If that fails she will become a Roman historian spending her days in Rome eating pizza and gelato. She is perpetually amazed by the sheer variety of science, every discipline so different and unique, yet all interconnecting and depending on each other. Lizzie does not believe in such nonsense as spirit animals, however, she fully supports patronuses and hers would be Pascal, the chameleon from Tangled. If she could be any piece of lab equipment it would be a pipette tip because she feels like it would be fun to be shot off the end of a pipette and go rocketing through the air. Although she believes it would be amusing to be phenolphthalein used in titrations, mainly so she can frustrate first year students by suddenly turning from clear to bright pink skipping every shade in between.
Major area of contribution
Sending excessive amounts of emails, developing the Human Practices, organising the team, designing the wiki, searching for sponsorship, involved in outreach events, working in the lab and speaking at Rotary Clubs.

Mark - Wet Lab Ninja 1
Mark is in the awkward no-mans land between third and fourth year of a Bachelor of Advanced Science majoring in Biochemistry and Biology. He wants to go into research and find ways to apply the crazy amounts of potential that synthetic biology has to solve problems in whatever fields he can conquer. His favourite aspect of science is the seemingly limitless potential to delve down into the nitty gritty of anything and find something fascinating about how it works. He thinks it’s incredible that even when you focus on the tiniest part of something that may never have seemed like much, there’ll be things that are unexpectedly beautiful, crazy, elegant and even broadly useful as the more you look the more there is to see. Mark’s spirit animal is a penguin as he loves freezing cold weather, enjoys seafood and wants to fulfill his life-long dream of getting places by sliding around on his stomach. If he could be any piece of equipment in the lab it would be the cool multi-channel pipettes as they are a wonderfully simple and clever solution to the problem of tedious pipetting. He would love to have that kind of elegance and wide-ranging usefulness as a person.

Sandi - Wet Lab Ninja 2
Sandi is in her third year of a Medical Science degree majoring in Molecular Biology and Genetics, and Microbiology. She has finished her diploma in Molecular Biotechnology and has worked in Singapore for two years in environmental science and metagenomics. She likes science because it is true and it can help the environment and people in many ways. In the future, she wants to pursue a career in genetics, specializing in understanding and finding the cure for cancer and other inheritable diseases. Her spirit animal is a tiger because like the tiger hunts its prey, she likes to take time observing information and being prepared before doing important things. If she could be any piece of equipment in the lab, she would like to be a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer for its specificity and accuracy to a small volume and how it is helpful to many genetic projects.
Major area of contribution
Wet Lab Ninja 2 and official lab book manuscriptor.

Gaia - Wet Lab Ninja 3
Gaia is in her third year of a Bachelor of Science majoring in immunology and biochemistry. She aims to pursue a career in biomedical research to help better the lives of people around the world. Her love of science stems from the fact that it constantly challenges and engages the mind as there is so much new knowledge to uncover and it is exciting to contribute. But her ultimate favourite thing about science is Parafilm. What a phenomenal invention. She has been told far too many times that her spirit animal is an owl, which she disagrees with and prefers it to be a puppy. Gaia’s hobbies include spending an excessive amount of time on BuzzFeed, she particularly likes the DIY life hacks page and has transformed all of the Ikea furniture in her college room into masterpieces of home decor. If she could be any piece of lab equipment she would be a lab notebook as everyone would treat her right, keep her updated and depend on her when they are confused.
Major area of contribution
Wet Lab Ninja 3, and developing the Codon Optimiser.

Mahiar - Safety Warden
Mahiar is in his third year of an Advanced Science degree majoring in Biochemistry and Mathematics. He aims to discover the mysteries of the universe, travel to the corners of the earth. He is interested in seeing how we can harbour mathematical computation in the field of biology as he believes that maths explains everything and that experiments can become faster and much more efficient if it coincides with mathematical modelling. To appeal to his humanitarian side, he wants to work on something which can benefit the lives of people and humanity. His favourite aspect of science is its ability to use reasoning to create a concrete model which can be applied to other areas to make the intended outcome. But more importantly is its ability to amend itself. It is not selfish and egoistic and can address its failures and shortcomings clearly with criticism and turn it into success after hard work. Most importantly, it can save lives and address the problems facing humanity whether it be pollution, climate change, food and nutrition and energy. Although Matt wishes his spirit animal was a unicorn, it is actually a pig. If Matt could be any piece of lab equipment it would be the humble paper towel because it is inflicted with so much mistreatment and lack of acknowledgment in regards to its contribution to the maintenance of the lab and the success of experiments. Alternatively he would be a centrifuge because he can make the world revolve around him, and keep going round and round and round.
Major area of contribution

Harry - Modelling Magician
Harry is in his fifth year of a double degree in Advanced Science and Mechanical (Space) Engineering, majoring in Mathematics and Physics, though he plans to pivot towards the biological sciences for future study. Following graduation at the end of the year, he wants to pursue a PhD program centered on Synthetic Biology and Genetic Engineering, and through this work with small-scale companies to develop biological solutions and technologies which can solve problems across industries, for a more sustainable and healthy world. His favourite facet of science is the interplay of different fields of expertise, from quantum physics to cell biology, to arrive at surprising yet elegant solutions to tricky problems. He hopes that new inroads into Synthetic Biology will demonstrate its vast potential to be used in such applications as a versatile and adaptable tool. Harry’s spirit animal is the Mudskipper, which as a fish / frog hybrid demonstrates impressive adaptability to changing situations and environments, though it appears to have taken on many of each animals worst features during the hybridisation process. If he could be any piece of laboratory equipment he would be a Petri dish, as they get to experience the wide variety of samples which pass through the lab, without being squeezed and abused like the pipettes.
Major area of contribution
Modelling and coding King, creating a 3D-printed gel electrophoresis timer, developing the business proposal.

Nick - Supervisor
Nick is a senior lecturer in Microbiology at the University of Sydney, and the head of an Environmental Biotechnology Research Group. Nick’s lab is focussed on bioremediation and biocatalysis, but has also taken on diverse other projects in microbial ecology, microbial genetics, public health microbiology, and agricultural microbiology. A major focus of the lab is the isolation and study of microorganisms able to biodegrade hydrocarbons and xenobiotic chemicals – such bacteria have unique enzymatic capacities, which have practical applications in the cleanup of contaminated sites or the “green chemistry” synthesis of fine chemicals. These bacteria are also intrinsically interesting due to what they can teach us about evolution, and especially the ways in which Nature adapts to meet chemical challenges. Another focus of the lab is on the biology of mobile genetic elements (MGEs, including plasmids, transposons, insertion sequences, integrons), which are key players in bacterial adaptation to industrial pollutants and antibiotics. A better understanding of MGEs would allow us to better predict and manage bacterial evolution, whether this is controlling the spread of antibiotic resistance, understanding the fate of recombinant DNA in the environment, or harnessing the power of MGEs for biotechnology. Nick is also the chief scientific officer of the Institute for Genetic Nefarity, a largely imaginary non-for-profit foundation which aims to use genetic technologies to create exceptionally heavy guitar riffs.

  Hi, I'm Crystal and I major in biotechnology. Instead of most iGEMers are sophomore in the college, I'm a freshman.    For this reason, I am extremely proud of being able to participate in this grand competition, and I'm look forward to    sharing and exchanging our intriguing project to all iGEMers who bear lots of fascinating ideas.
  Hi! I am Chen-Yu Chang and I major in Biotechnology. I am so excited because this is my first time participating international competition. Joining NCTU_Formosa imp-  roves my experimental skills and gives me an opportunity to learn how to edit wiki pages. I also learned how to search paper for information to help solving problems.
  Hello, I'm You-An Chen, majoring in Biotechnology and like to play volleyball. Because I want some different experience    as a freshman, I joined the NCTU_Formosa team and I have learned a lot about IGEM. Besides, I also want to make     some minded friends. Therefore, I'm looking forward to meet you !
  Yo~ I'm Ray, a Nano Science and Engineering major in NCTU.The reason why I participates in NCTU Formosa iGEM team     is that I love the feeling of working with friends which have the same belief with me and accomplishing the tasks    together, eventually doing something good to the society. At first, I always doubt that if I am capable of being a part of    this big competition.But now, I am convinced that I am ready for it!
  Hi. I'm Ru-Hua Lin, a junior student in Nation Chiao Tung University, majoring in biological science and technology.    Using amazing biological method to solve problems is my motivation to join iGEM family. During the process of     developing the creative idea, I found that there are unlimited probability in the limited know-  ledge. I am very glad to    meet you, friends.
  I'm Ming-Hsiu! I met iGEM on 'Scientific American' magazine when I'm a senior high school student. It is so cool and     fun for me to create a live which can do anything we want just by inserting a gene! Fortunately, I joined the     NCTU_Formosa iGEM team, being able to create our own project! I can't wait to share our project and listen your    project in Boston! We are iGEMer, Let's enjoy the amazing field!
  I'm Nai-Chen Chi A junior student in NCTU I'm an engineering student who knew little about bio tech at first But now I     know more by doing research or experiment. Things that I could never learn if I haven't join igem team. What's more,     I'm super proud of my team because my team is just like a family I love all of them and I enjoy doing everything with    them even though sometimes it's so exhausted that I almost gave up I hope this memory could last forever and the    friendship never end.
  I am Amber and I'm a freshman now. I major in transportation and logistics ma-  nagement. Because I have great     teammates that taught me and helped me a lot so I can really learned a great lesson from this competition. I'm so     proud of being a member of NCTU_FORMOSA and an igemer.

iGEM Asian Conference
The perfect event that NCTU_Formosa had been preparing for so long started on 7/19, which lasted for 5 days. We had 27 teams present, about 210 attendees from China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. We even have teams from India and Kazakhstan join us during the meetup through the internet. So all the process of Asian conference is open to the whole world. Throughout the 5-day conference, each team had prepared presentation for their amazing projects and ideas.  After all the presentations, our professors also as judges will give pieces of advice to the teams. Afterwards, Q&A time was a chance to interact with each team. Besides presentation, poster time during every meal not only fed us with exquisitely prepared food but also knowledge. All these activities enable us to rethink our project with different angles, improving our 27 projects into a new level.   At the end of the conference, each team were given special gifts, embrace bunch of friends, and feel happy and proud to be igemers. After the conference, we planned a day trip in Taipei, visiting National Palace Museum and Taipei 101. Both are the must-go attraction that nobody would miss when coming to Taiwan.
Skype meetup
We had 4 engaging internet discussions with teams that were KAIT_ Japan, Amoy_ China, TU Delft, and Oxford. We always learned so much from each team’s amazing idea. After exchanging ideas, we were amazed by them and what’s more, as we talked to different people from different culture, culture shock and multicultural interaction experience were something we were excited about. With all these cross-cultural meet ups, our lives had been spiced up.
Skype meeting with Amoy on May 13
Skype meeting with KAIT_Japan on May 20
Skype meeting with TU_Delft on August 4
Mini Conference with iGEMers and Professor
Mini Conference with Mingdao & HSNU
We also held mini conference in Taiwan with Mindao and HSNU on June 8 to help them with their project about modeling and show how our team work on June 7th. We have organize a one day mini conference. At first, we have presentation time to every group. After presentation, we also have Q&A time to give some pieces advice also assist them to have a better experimental design and any confronted problem. We also teach them basic experimental skills, for example, ligation and digestion. At the end, we had vigorous discussions with as many as possible people. Now, each team have better understanding about synthetic biology and their project.
Mini Conference with CGU on June 14
The first-recruited team CGU come for exchanging ideas about their project. Out of excitement, it just happened to be that our projects were also about improving medical problem. We were surprised that we were helpful to each other in this conference. Besides, we also give them some pieces advice to manage their new team to promote their working efficiency.
Mini conference with iGEMers from New Zealand Auckland IGEM team and South China University of Technology on July 3
It was a very excited day as there was a meetup with iGEMers from New Zealand Auckland IGEM team and South China University of Technology in NCTU. The main focus point on this meetup was to share and discuss the experiences of forming the iGEM teams. To make this discussion effective, our team previous leader also joined the meetup and so can provided more information with our friends. We discussed about the ways of recruiting and training members. After knowing the experiences of each other, those experiences can be a useful references for us in the future. Our instructor, Professor Chen also shared his experiences and thought about iGEM. We appreciate their coming!
Mini conference with Professor Westenberg on July 30
Professor Westenberg from Missouri University of Science and Technology came to NCTU. He gave us some valuable advice on how we can alter our experiment. We had a really great time-sharing each other's project, and show him around our campus.
Newsletter
We took part in Amoy newsletters no 1, no2 and no3. We have shown how our team works. The best thing is that we shared our experiences to harmonize with each team member, hoping to share the key to success. We also wrote about the ethics topic that happened in Guangzhou’s Sun Yat-sen University about modifying human embryos. Lastly, we also talked about the progressing project. We had been proud and happy to share all our knowledge, our opinions and with the world.

December 2014:Team Formation
At that time there was an organized group from Universidad de Chile called OpenBio . That team was founded on December 2013 by Luis Rodriguez and Pablo Troncoso (we miss you!). Organization’s main objectives are:
1.- Boosting Synthetic Biology in Chile.
2.- Development of low cost Biotechnologies machines.
3.- Periodically attendance to the iGEM Competition.
The group used to participate in different activities in university to spread synthetic biology through workshops and informative talks.
Thanks to the activities that the group developed and others that were attended by them, was possible to contact with people interested in being part of the project and very committed to the tasks involved in developing it.
Finally we formed the Team iGEM Uchile-OpenBio, we all feel part of the team and if you want to know more about the members of the team we invite you to see our
March 2015:Team Registration
The group inscription fee was paid by CeBiB and DIQBT for a total amount of 4000 USD. CeBiB also lent us their laboratories to developthe project and help us with diffusion.
Centre for Biotechnology and Bioengineering (CeBiB) is a center of excellence in frontier research by an interdisciplinary team composed of renowned national and international, able to investigate key issues of modern biotechnology and bioengineering, including important applications in industry.
Department of Chemical Engineering and Biotechnology (DIQBT) is part of Faculty of phisics sciences and mathematics (FCFM), Univerisdad de Chile. It teaches two engineering specialities: Chemical and Biotechnological Engineering.
¿How did we obtain this support at the first time?
Ignacio Ardiles and Luis Rodriguez created a Sponsorship letter offering to the institutions being our sponsors. In exchange for their support we offer them:
1.- Team official clothing.
2.- Our official Website and social networks.
3.- 9 cm downside the official poster.
4.- Our Wiki project, actually this part.
Also we will honor our sponsors at the end of our presentation with special mentions.
April 2015:Team Consolidation
After the registration the team set up weekly meetings to plan the work of each week.  Also each member of the team adopted a project area. The distribution of areas was agreed by all members.
We agreed that the responsible of each area would coordinate all the activities of that specific area. However, all team members are responsible for asisting in the areas applying for aid.
Each area has to report their advance  and show their main activities for next weeks. With this assigment we are training our leadership and planning skills on each member.

We received an invitation for a contest conducted by Aplica tu Idea and Fundacion COPEC UC where you can give a short pitch on 3 minutes to present your idea. The first place wins $ 200 to support the project. Despite the price was less than 1% of our budget it was a great oportunity to show our project and get prepaired to next presentations.
Gustavo Calvo was in charge of creating the speech and make the presentation at the headquarters of the Universidad Católica. He obtained the Second place on the contest and was awarded with a special price for the team. Although we did not get 200 dollars, the contest opened our way to make the project better known.
July 2015:Integrated DNA Technologies
Integrated DNA Technologies sells short strands of DNA called oligonucleotides. IDT manufactures the oligo using chemical DNA synthesis machines designed and built by them. IDT is the largest manufacturer of custom oligo products in the US today.
IDT launched a promotion applicable for all participating iGEM teams 2015. They will provde equivalent to 20kb gBlocks Gene Fragments from 1th april to 24 september. The avaluation of the support was around 4272 USD (Golden Sponsor). Of course we cannot miss this chance and asked for our benefits.
Jose Duguet contacted IDT at first with the list of g-blocks needed. They told us that they have a local distributor: Fermelo BIOTEC. Alejandro Sanchez, technical supporter of Fermelo BIOTEC contacted us and brought us the support , intermediating the arrival of oligonuclotides to our laboratory. We are very glad with their arrival.
July 2015:Collecting Interest Letters
One of the main task given by Open Bucheff was to collect 4 interest letters from different organizations. It was a necessary task if we want to gain our Faculty support. That was how our team members began to contact institutions that could write their letters of interest to us. We collected a total of 6 letters of interest
David Sepulveda brought the following letters
(1) Leandro Valencia, La Ruta Solar.
(2) Fernán Federici, Department of Molecular Genetics and Microbiology. Faculty of Cs. Biological. Universidad Católica de Chile.
Also, Severine Cazaux brought 3 letters
(1) Juan Cristobal Zagal, Fablab UChile, Santiago.
(2) Claudia Tellez, Comisión Chilena de cooperación con UNESCO
(3)Andrés Briceño, Co-Director FabLab
Finally, Noemi Miranda helped us with 1 letter
(1) Marcelo Mena Carrasco, Undersecretary Ministry of Environment
Those letters realy helped us to support our project when we faced our next sponsors of the project. Sponsors realy appreciate this cards and they get more interested on the project.
July 2015:Open Beauchef, FCFM
OpenBeauchef consists of a co-working space (collaborative work) that FCFM facilities. It is located at 851 Avenue Beauchef in the OpenLab. It is designed to create a meeting place for cooperative activities that allow interaction between various innovation actors. It includes students, researchers and developers from every faculty of the Universidad de Chile, together with participants from academia, business, public sector, graduates and investors.
The contact was made first by Severine Cazaux , who tried to contact our Dean Faculty. At first he conducted us to the OpenLab to obtain some team support. They helped us with Mentoring through 2 workshops where we could see our team interests and availability for the project. They also gave us some tasks to gain support on the project: We had to collect 4 interests letters related to our project.
After that and other meetings they wrote a report of the team with the results of the activities. Finally they gave us tips for our team work.
It realy helped us to align all members interests. Also it was our first approachment to our Faculty.
August 2015:ICEI Ingeniería y Construcción
ICEI Ingeniería y construcción LTDA was funded in 1995 in Chile, as an association of professionals with proven experience in the development of industrial, mining and real estate throughout the country projects.
ICEI Ingeniería y construcción LTDA. supported us with 1695 USD (Silver Sponsor). The money was used to pay 1 plane tickets and 1 individual registration fee. They also supported us with the purchase process of 7 plane tickets by lending us money until we get the money of the Crowdfunding Campaign. This company was contacted directly by Anariky Negrete.
Finally they lend us more money, to purchase the lasts 2 plane tickets. This was a gesture of great confidence with us because we were waiting for the confirmation of next sponsor. We really appreciate what the have done for us!.
August 2015:We have a team Budget!
Our Budget was made for 9 members of the team and then was agregated the team instructor.
This budget was made by Ignacio Ardiles, with collaboration of David Sepulveda . It definitely helped us to convince sponsors to finance the remaining costs of the team. This budget gave them clarity on the use that will be given to the funds that they will provide.
After that, we realized that some items of the budget exceeded the estimated cost. As the cost of clothing and networking far exceeded our expectations. This has finally conditioned us to readjust the cost of food and transport at a much lower amount than initially estimated. Get more details of the budget attached on link .
August 2015:Support: FCFM
Faculty of Physics Sciences and Mathematics (FCFM) of the Universidad de Chile  has more than 170 years of existence. It focuses on higher education and the development of basic sciences, engineering sciences and technological applications.
FCFM supported the team with 4218 USD (Golden Sponsor). The money provided is going to be used to pay the accommodation expenses remaining for 9 members of the team!.
The contact was with Felipe Alvarez, (Vice-Decan of FCFM) and it was made by Severine Cazaux since last May!. FCFM agreed to have a meeting on August. Luis Rodriguez, Severine Cazaux and Ignacio Ardiles attended with a sponsor presentation, to show the current status of the project and the real potential for them: New Technology research lines around Synthetic biology.
.
August 2015:FCFM
Faculty of Phisics Sciences and Mathematics published a journalistic article on its official website after their agree to be sponsors of our team. It was done by Noemi Miranda (Communications officer at CeBiB) and Ana Maria Saez (Communications coordinator at FCFM).
September 2015:Ministry of Environment
The project was highlighted on the official website of the Ministry of Environment and their social networks. The ministry got interested in the project because of its sustainable character. They considered it was an environmental friendly project. The contact Noemi Miranda.
January 2015:Conception of the Idea
The insight arose from the FABLAB UChile, after Pablo Troncoso met Fernando Torres (project engineer in FABLAB). They told us how important was the PLA in the 3D impression. We also share interest in the open source philosophy so they gave us all the support for our project including an letter of interest.
After that our team looked for different uses of PLA in the society concluding that it was a powerful project and José Duguet provided us the scientific literature. The conception of the idea was born and the main goal of the project is to reduce the cost of synthesis of polylactic acid to encourage a massive use of this new material. We hope to stop pollution by plastic made from fossil fuels
March 2015:New Team Supports
Research, Science and Technology National Commission (CONICYT) provided us around $2570 USD (Silver Sponsor). We used the money to pay 4 event fee payments.
CONICYT was founded in 1967 as an advisory entity to the Presidency in matters of scientific development. Their strategic pillars are: the promotion of human capital formation and strengthening scientific and technological base of the country.
The contacts were made by Severine Cazaux since last may through emails to Leticia Toro, representative of CONICYT. Our first letter sent asked for 8 inscriptions fee for  the iGEM Competition.
At first we did not have answers. Then Severine Cazaux and David Sepulveda visited CONICYT offices requesting a response. That act was well received by the institution and finally on 18 June we got the PCI CONICYT letter, giving notice of the funds allocated for 4 people.
May 2015:Silent Work
“Silence is the element in which all great things are formed”
Thomas Carlyle (1795-1881)
We decided to launch a crowdfunding campaign where we could explain our project and get funds to travel to Boston, USA. The goal was to collect 2,600,000 CLP (3715 USD) for the next 45 days.
The platform selected was Fondeadora, a Mexican platform which has expanded its business to Chile. It has a All or nothing model.
The campaign was designed by Gustavo Calvo and Ignacio Ardiles, edited by Natalia Urtubia and the music of the video was provided by Nicolas Cazaux, Severine's Brother.
The choice of platform was made for three main reasons.
1. One of the creators of the platform came from Mexico in 2014 to present our university and we considered that it was a great and effective platform.
2. The platform has good payment methods, such as Web-pay or transfers that are well accepted by the people of our country.
3. The platform has offices in Chile which facilitates our direct communication.
The Campaign started on 16 of June on 2015. After that we strive to spread the campaign on our networks with different messages, banners and other kind of posts.
June 2015:SIGMA-ALDRICH
Sigma Aldrich is a leading Life Science and High Technology company focused on enhancing human health and safety, manufactures and distributes more than 250,000 chemicals, biochemicals and other essential products to more than 1.4 million customers globally in research and applied labs as well as in industrial and commercial markets.
Sigma-Aldrich provided us laboratory reagents valuated around 1900 USD (Golden Sponsor). The contacts were made by Luis Rodriguez. He contacted Cristian Torres (Company’s Sales Manager) by email, asking him for support in first time (and attaching our sponsorship letter).
They told us that they usually don't give funds for those instances but maybe they could support us with laboratory reactives. So after that we defined which was the list of reactives we could ask for this institution. We sent the list on may 26 and last June the reactives arrived to our laboratory. Thanks to Sigma aldrich we could start our lab experiments.
July 2015:We reached the goal!!
Crowdfunding campaign ended succesfully on July 29th reaching a total amount of 2,620,003 CLP (101% of the goal). The support was provided by 83 differents funders (we included the list of people how gave money in cash).
Our commitment to our funders is to provide them information about the project and then rewards as soon as we get them (It will be after the competition)
Finally about the money withdraw from Fondeadora, we consider that it was a tedious process. That is because they told us we could withdraw the money 5 days after reaching the goal. But the days passed and the money did not arrive until 31 August where we finally got our 3378 USD (The fee was around 12,3% of total).
Finally, they told us the origin of the problem (Bank issues). Despite this, we still consider Fondeadora is a good platform for funding your projects, but you may talk about the money arrival time.
July 2015:gBlocks arrived
gBlocks were provided by Integrated DNA Technologies . The arrival meant to us that we could finally began to assemble our genetic circuits.
But... Why are gBlocs so important?
For every design in synthetic biology, a  high fidelity technique is imperative to obtain large fragments of DNA for coding our gene of interest with the regulation elements. The team initially considered to obtain the genetic source from microorgansisms, amplify them and then produce the assemblies by overlap extension by PCR. Thanks to gBlocks we could save all this work in laboratory that would require weeks, shipping times  of biological material and we would not have been able perform codon optimization
July 2015:El Diario de Atacama
Diario Atacama is a daily newspaper of the Atacama Region, Chile. The contact done was with Catalina Canales (Journalist at Diario Atacama) and it was done by Ignacio Ardiles. Also it was possible thanks to the project description done by David Sepulveda. The project description is attached at the following

Sean Ross Craig
BSc Microbiology Graduate, University of Dundee; MRes Microbiology Graduate, Birkbeck, University of London
A University of Dundee BSc Microbiology 2012 Graduate, he worked as a chef for a year and a half after graduation. Birkbeck, University of London gave Sean the opportunity to study the subject that he loves and work at the same time. He was able to complete his MRes due to the flexibility of Birkbeck. Without an institution such as Birkbeck offering the flexibility in study, he would not have been able to obtain a research based post-graduate qualification.  Being a part of the iGEM team means a lot to Sean & he hopes to give back to the great institute that provided him with the opportunity to pursue a career in academic science.
When Sean is not looking at Biosynthetic pathways or dreaming up scientific ideas for the good of mankind sean enjoys playing & watching football. He also has a keen interest in nature. He has the pace to keep up with Elliott on the eating front (but doesn’t have the stamina to eat the sheer volume) however, does have the stamina on the drinking front.

Tim Walker
BSc Biological Sciences (Biotechnology) Graduate, University of Edinbrough; MRes Microbiology (Distinction) Graduate, Birkbeck, University of London
Tim is fascinated by the rich diversity of the microbial world, and how this can be utilised for biotechnological and medical usage.
During this time he felt restless and enrolled on the part-time MSc Microbiology course at Birkbeck. Almost immediately he rediscovered his passion for microbiology and the following year he quit recruitment and transferred to a full-time MRes research project. The project was to assess the activity of a light-activated antimicrobial surface. ""Despite blowing my life savings and having to also work part-time to support myself, it was the best decision I've ever made"". He fell in love with research and his hard work has earnt me a BBSRC PhD scholarship to investigate the biosynthetic capabilities of Actinomycetes.""
Tim's effort in the Owligos team is around Practice & Policy and Sponsorship. Tim is proud to be a part of the inaugural Birkbeck iGEM team because, without the flexible learning opportunities they offer to full-time working people, he wouldn't have been able to complete a Masters and wouldn't now be living his dream as a research microbiologist. Tim is very excited by the project we are developing and looks forward to showing everyone at the Giant Jamboree everything we have achieved!

Birkbeck iGEM
The Owligos are the first-ever team entered into the international Genetically Engineered Machine (iGEM) Competition by Birkbeck, University of London. We’re a varied group of students who reflect the diversity and unique character of our institution: many of us have chosen science as a second career, having already spent some time in full-time work. For most of us, this has meant making our way through a degree while continuing to work full-time. Hopefully this kind of dedication will help us successfully navigate our way through our iGEM project.
Project Aim
Our project aims to create a new diagnostic solution that will be low-tech and cost-effective enough to allow its usage in deprived and remote communities. We’re attempting to engineer a bacteriophage lambda chassis to change its host affinity, while simultaneously adding a marker that will facilitate easy detection of a target bacterial pathogen in patient samples.
To demonstrate this approach as a proof of concept for the competition, we plan to change this affinity between different strains of E.coli; however, ultimately we hope to demonstrate that this principle could also be applied to alter the phage’s host range to other bacterial species. We could then provide a modular system capable of diagnosing a range of diseases. Of course, we haven’t chosen a simple goal. But as Birkbeck pioneers, we are determined to prove ourselves by making our project a success. We can’t wait to present the results of our work at the Giant Jamboree in September!

Sean Ross Craig
BSc Microbiology Graduate, University of Dundee; MRes Microbiology Graduate, Birkbeck, University of London
A University of Dundee BSc Microbiology 2012 Graduate, he worked as a chef for a year and a half after graduation. Birkbeck, University of London gave Sean the opportunity to study the subject that he loves and work at the same time. He was able to complete his MRes due to the flexibility of Birkbeck. Without an institution such as Birkbeck offering the flexibility in study, he would not have been able to obtain a research based post-graduate qualification.  Being a part of the iGEM team means a lot to Sean & he hopes to give back to the great institute that provided him with the opportunity to pursue a career in academic science.
When Sean is not looking at Biosynthetic pathways or dreaming up scientific ideas for the good of mankind sean enjoys playing & watching football. He also has a keen interest in nature. He has the pace to keep up with Elliott on the eating front (but doesn’t have the stamina to eat the sheer volume) however, does have the stamina on the drinking front.

Along the way Shapoor has gained qualifications in; IT, Business, Mathematics & natural Science. His favourite subject was Natural Science which he choose to take further by studying a BSc in Chemical & Molecular Biology at Birkbeck, University of London. The flexibility of Birkbeck has enabled Shapoor to work full time and study part-time towards a BSc. He has worked hard and stuck to this degree route which he has successfully completed his second year.
Shapoor has an interest in a wide range of academic subjects ranging from philosophy to international relations. One of his main passions is fine literature (particularly poetry). Shapoor has a keen interest in fassion and fancy/colourful hats!

Tim Walker
BSc Biological Sciences (Biotechnology) Graduate, University of Edinbrough; MRes Microbiology (Distinction) Graduate, Birkbeck, University of London
Tim is fascinated by the rich diversity of the microbial world, and how this can be utilised for biotechnological and medical usage.
During this time he felt restless and enrolled on the part-time MSc Microbiology course at Birkbeck. Almost immediately he rediscovered his passion for microbiology and the following year he quit recruitment and transferred to a full-time MRes research project. The project was to assess the activity of a light-activated antimicrobial surface. ""Despite blowing my life savings and having to also work part-time to support myself, it was the best decision I've ever made"". He fell in love with research and his hard work has earnt me a BBSRC PhD scholarship to investigate the biosynthetic capabilities of Actinomycetes.""
Tim's effort in the Owligos team is around Practice & Policy and Sponsorship. Tim is proud to be a part of the inaugural Birkbeck iGEM team because, without the flexible learning opportunities they offer to full-time working people, he wouldn't have been able to complete a Masters and wouldn't now be living his dream as a research microbiologist. Tim is very excited by the project we are developing and looks forward to showing everyone at the Giant Jamboree everything we have achieved!

Originally from Brazil, Vitor went to northern Scotland for a gap year and fell in love with the weather. As the second best student in Economics in his year (in a class of two), he decided early that Mathematics was a far better investment – ditching Economics in favour of Further Mathematics. He joined University of Cambridge to do Physics, heard the calling of Chemistry but due to a poor choice of modules in the Natural Sciences Tripos, ended up a biochemist (BA, MSci and the freebie MA).
He stayed in Cambridge for a PhD in bacterial pathogenesis and for his post-doctoral career in synthetic biology. In his steady march South, he joined UCL and Birkbeck as Lecturer in Synthetic Biology in 2013.

Part-time Team Members
Birkbeck as an institution prides itself on being accessible to all, and so Birkbeck's iGEM team made sure it was also. We had team members dedicated to the project from the outset but, because of working full-time and other commitments extending through the entirety of the project, could only commit a limited amount of time. They therefore used their expertise to aid particular aspects of the project when possible. Their roles in the project are also outlined below.
Wayne Pires - Birkbeck iGEM Team Founder
BSc Chemical & Molecular Biology Graduate, Birkbeck, University of London
Mervyn Richardson - Outreach Participant
2nd Year BSc Chemical & Molecular Biology, Birkbeck, University of London
For the last 9 years, Mervyn has been working in the logistics industry at DHL Express. He has always been fascinated by genetics and finds the intricacies of the bio-molecular world intellectually stimulating. Now, Mervyn hopes to embark on a new and rewarding career in the biosciences.
Mervyn is currently working at DHL and studying towards a BSc in chemical & molecular biology at Birkbeck University of London. He feels privileged to be in the first iGEM team to represent Birkbeck and is committed to setting a high standard paving the way for successive teams in the future. Mervyn joined the team to improve on lab skills & work towards solving the issue of diagnostics at the point of care in developing countries.
Shapoor Mohamadi - Outreach Participant
2rd year BSc Chemical & Molecular Biology, Birkbeck, University of London
Shapoor is an accidental would be biochemist. 12 times he has started a university degree and 12 times he decided it wasn’t for him! Along the way Shapoor has gained qualifications in IT, Business, Mathematics & Natural Sciences. His favourite subject was Natural Sciences which he chose to take further by studying a BSc in Chemical & Molecular Biology at Birkbeck, University of London. The flexibility of Birkbeck has enabled Shapoor to work full-time and study part-time towards a BSc. He has worked hard and stuck to this degree route and has now successfully completed his second year.
Shapoor has an interest in a wide range of academic subjects ranging from philosophy to international relations. One of his main passions is fine literature (particularly poetry). Shapoor has a keen interest in fashion and fancy/colourful hats!

Tim Walker - Policy and Practice Advisor
BSc Biological Sciences (Biotechnology) Graduate, University of Edinbrough; MRes Microbiology (Distinction) Graduate, Birkbeck, University of London
Tim is fascinated by the rich diversity of the microbial world, and how this can be utilised for biotechnological and medical usage.
During this time he felt restless and enrolled on the part-time MSc Microbiology course at Birkbeck. Almost immediately he rediscovered his passion for microbiology and the following year he quit recruitment and transferred to a full-time MRes research project. The project was to assess the activity of a light-activated antimicrobial surface. ""Despite blowing my life savings and having to also work part-time to support myself, it was the best decision I've ever made"". He fell in love with research and his hard work has earnt me a BBSRC PhD scholarship to investigate the biosynthetic capabilities of Actinomycetes.""
Tim's effort in the Owligos team is around Practice & Policy and Sponsorship. Tim is proud to be a part of the inaugural Birkbeck iGEM team because, without the flexible learning opportunities they offer to full-time working people, he wouldn't have been able to complete a Masters and wouldn't now be living his dream as a research microbiologist. Tim is very excited by the project we are developing and looks forward to showing everyone at the Giant Jamboree everything we have achieved!"

Lingyi Chen
The goal of our research is to understand the transcriptional program upon differentiation and reprogramming. A single cell, the zygote, can divide and differentiate into all types of cells in an organism. Even though the genetic information encoded in the genomic DNA is identical in the cells of the same organism, the readouts of the genetic information, namely transcriptional program, vary from cell to cell. Differential transcriptional programs lead to differential gene expression profiles, hence, different phenotypes and different cell fates. Transcription factors, epigenetic modification, microRNAs and signaling transduction pathways all contribute to the regulation of transcriptional program. We are interested in understanding the regulatory mechanisms underlying pluripotent cell differentiation, e.g. from ES cells to differentiated cells, or from the zygote to the blastocyst, and then to the cells of three germ layers. Recent studies showed that ectopic expression of few transcription factors can reverse differentiated somatic cells to an embryonic stage, namely induced pluripotent stem cells (iPS cells). Due to their pluripotency and easy derivation without requirement for developing embryos, iPS cells hold great promise for regenerative medicine. We are eager to explore the underlying transcriptional and epigenetic mechanisms of somatic cell reprogramming. Meanwhile, we are developing new methods to derive iPS cells, which are suitable for clinical application.

MntA transport
Yu Zhong and Xiaojun Cai were responsible for the combination of constitutive promoter added in front of the MntA protein with the double terminator behind. After that, they just tested the parameters of the relationship of the concentration of cadmium out and in the E.coli. They spent all their summer holiday finishing it.
Cadmium adsorption
Ruiming Xiao, Xiaojing Li and Jionghui Li managed CsgA transport part. Ruiming Xiao and Xiaojing Li was in charge of the construction of PcadA +CsgA-EC(n)+TetR+RFP+ter. Jionghui Li also made efforts to assist both of them. Ruiming Xiao made brilliant contributions and devoted himself to testing the MerR/CadA operon using red fluorescent protein and he also helped Li to measure the AU of the RFP. As for Xiaojing Li, she was diligent and she made great efforts to construct different number of EC protein in order to find the best one. Also, because of deleting the wild CsgA will help efficiently express EC, So Minghui Deng and Yulong Zhang were responsible for the CsgA deletion.
Sensor system
Xiaomei Lin and Xunxun Luo buried themselves in this part. They just made the device such as Ptet+cjblue+ter. And also, Xiaomei Lin had finished the measurement work with the help of Xiaojing Li. In addition, combining with the device of CsgA transport system, Li and Lin successfully tested the fluorescent protein and checked if the system worked.
Design work
Yihong Gu, Shuoyu Chen, Jiahui Zhang and Yunan Lin had undertaken all the tasks of designing of the whole team. They did a lot work including logo, ppt templates, wiki and uniforms. Taking step by step, as a result of clarified division and efficient cooperation, they sophisticatedly design uniforms and posters for the IGEM. And Manfredi helped modify the wiki content.
Modeling Part
Junying Su is responsible for final determination of mathematical model for our project. He devotes to modeling the function of our engineering E.coli accurately. In addition, he writes Parameters Measuring and Data Processing Schemes for four parts, including MntA Transport Model, PcadA Strength Model, csgA Polymerization Model and csgA-ECn Adsorption Model. He also assists the members of experiment group to finish measuring work.
Xiaobin Huang is responsible for studying the mechanism of MntA transport. In order to find out a suitable mathematical model, he has also studied the mechanism of sodium potassium pump and calcium pump, which are also the members of the P-type family of adenosine
triphosphatases (ATPases). At the same time, he devotes to establishing the model of Ptet Strength. He has found out two available models in the previous iGEM work of Team EPF-Lausanne 2008 and Team UC Davis 2013 respectively. [1][2] Additionally, he works in data processing.
Chongyin Han is responsible for studying the mechanism of csgA polymerization. In order to find out a suitable mathematical model, he has studied an available model in the work of Team INSA-Lyon 2014. [3] Whether this model is useful for us, we need further verification.
Nana Pang is responsible for studying the mechanism of PcadA and merR mutant, and devotes to establishing the model of PcadA Strength. In order to figure out the accurate concentration of cadmium ion at which PcadA takes obvious effect, she analyzes the combination process of cadmium ion and merR.
Jing Liao is responsible for studying the mechanism of csgA-ECn adsorption. She devotes to working out the value of disassociation constant Kd with the available data. In addition, she tries to figure out the optimal value of csgA-ECn length n to improve the ability of cadmium ion adsorption.

The Cooper Union iGEM Team
Chris Lastihenos
I am a sophomore studying chemical engineering with a minor in biomedical engineering at Cooper Union.  This summer was not my first time working in a research lab, but it was my first time participating on an igem team.  I am primarily interested in genetic engineering and biochemistry which is why I worked mainly on the wetware component of this project.
Karlin Yeh
I am a Sophmore Mechanical Engineer at The Cooper Union.  I'm new to synthetic biology, but have been competing in robotics competitions for 8 years. My main role in the lab is designing hardware for the team's various experiments and the occasional repair. When not working on iGEM hardware, you can find me tinkering with my 3D printers or trying to grow Mara de Bois strawberries and Chocolate Habaneros hydroponically.
Lily Lin
I am a Junior Chemical Engineer at The Cooper Union. Aside from being my group's math adviser, I also flex my linguistic muscles by helping Dionne learn Spanish. Speaking of languages, I love learning them and am often found repeating Italian, Arabic, or Korean phrases that I've just discovered. I'm also Sara's partner-in-crime in CSA, and I exercise my eloquent oral skills in Toastmasters. *eats toast* It sure does smell like yeast in here... Also, I'm surprisingly the tallest member of the group despite the fact that I've been told that I'm short by a good number of people.
Tushar Nichakawade
When I was a young boy, my parents decided it would be a good opportunity to meet our source of life and energy: the sun. I thought this great ball of flaming glory in the heavens would bring me peace and love. Instead, it just made me overly tanned. Sometimes I’m glad I chose this path, so I can resolve dermal ailments such as when Chris gets sunburnt.
Yingfu Ma
I am cool guy. I make Susung's software into hardware. I am especially efficient at hunting down PCR machines. I have found many in the wild, and until now I have never caught one. Just yesterday, I managed to snag it as it was sleeping. You can see me wearing its remains as a reminder to other PCR machines. However I am inferior to Tushar, because his IQ is higher than the number of base pairs in my genome.
John Song
When it comes to games, I'm always number 1. I'm Korean, so you know I'm good. Keith and Susung have nothing on my mad skills. When they lose, they get mad and call me trash because I dumpstered on their play. I can carry this team like I carried Susung to Challenger I.
Keith Joseph
I taught Kobe how to ball, and am still better than Susung. Basketball, like iGEM, is a team game; pass the ball to the main player (me) and we win. Sadly, Susung broke my ankles in NBA2K15 so I had to retire from playing basketball. That's when I decided to pick up iGEM and work on the wetwork. If I can't ball, at least I can do colony PCR.
Susung Choi
I'm the real boss; anyone else who says otherwise, is a liar. I am also the eldest son of the CEO of Samsung, hence, my name. I’m Challenger I in League of Legends, and I play for the professional team. Some of you may recognize me by my sophisticated jungling mechanics, and my IGN: Saintvicious. I am also a god at programming, but my true skills lie in my ability to destroy Keith at NBA2K15.
Jean Lam
I am not pants. Pants are not for me. The instant I was born, I was saying the word 'jean.' My parents thought I would grow up to be a fashion designer, so they named me Jean. What they didn't know was that I really meant to say 'gene.'
Soon Yi, Mentor
Interstellar is the best movie. I watched it over 50 times in the past week. How do I find the time to do this? It's easy! I get my minion, Tushar, to do my transformations and PCR clean up for my own projects. I'm also very good at giving the team false hope by inviting everybody to go eat ice cream, and then pushing it off to a later date. Maybe.
Oliver Medvedik, PhD
I am the mastermind behind iGEM at Cooper Union. I do everything at once. I prefer to spend at much time in the lab as humanly possible, and encourage my students to join me. There are times when I will set up an experiment that will be done at 2 AM, and that is completely acceptable to me. The students have lovingly re-named my cat Misha to Oligo. I am very interested in all things Bio, but the aging process in particular. I'm a busy man because I need to manage a company I co-founded: GenSpace, the first community biohacking lab based in Brooklyn. I run down there all the time because I want to see everyone succeed.

Dac Anh
We'd like to thank Dac Anh, a graduate mentor who formerly worked at Mount Sinai's Icahn School of Medicine, for his assistance on the design of the device. His input allowed us to properly plan for taking the project into the next step, and explained the possibility of using microfluidics to improve on the current model.
Hardware
This part of the project encompasses the physical device. It involves work with fluidics devices, thermocyclers, and circuitry.  Hardware team members closely collaborated to insure that all these different parts would work together
Software
This was the coding part of the project.  It involves coding the arduino to control the loomino device along with designing the team website.
Wetware
The wet work of this project encompassed all genetic engineering components.  TdT based experiments were carried out by these team members.  People who worked on this designed sequences, ran digests and ligations, and transformed bacteria.  All protocols involving preparation of glass slides were grouped with wetware because the skills needed for these protocols better matched the wetware team's specialties."

你在火中涅槃，灵魂不死；你在花间长眠，记忆不消。绚烂的阳光是迎接你西去的光环，不知你独自一人去那方可会感到孤单？ [一]魂去       起初听到你的死，我是愕然的。毕竟听说你的病情好了不少，却不料那只是最后的回光返照。       我没有流泪，甚至没有悲伤，脑子里只是混混沌沌的一团。死？那是我们所有人最后的归宿吧。或许于你更是能够减少痛苦，未尝不是一件好事。       一切被我想得太简单，甚至太过理所当然了。理智，真是一个可怕的局。 [二]席间       小号、大鼓敲个不停，那种声音不得不说是一种噪音。良久声止，开始一个个念悼词。       我这时才发现，原来我并没有那么冷漠，缘是城市的喧嚣麻木了我的心。想起那年你的温言软语、慈爱笑容，泪竟是就这样忍不住地从眼眶中溢出了。我撇过头，不愿让人看见，嘴角仍是挂着笑容。       呵呵，我竟觉着在这葬礼上哭泣都是可耻的。望着周围人谈笑风生，我的心有点寒。到场的那么多人，究竟又有几个是真心的呢？可怜，还是可悲啊？       原来人可以铁石心肠这种程度，可毕竟他们中很多人比我和你的关系更近啊！听着那个花钱雇来哭的人呜咽，看着那人热泪纵横，我终是忍不住苦笑，竟是一个毫不相识的外人哭得最伤心。这是讽刺，还是笑话？    [三]送葬        你说，为什么他们还能那样淡然，可我偏偏忍不住泪流满面？为什么他们那个惊讶的表情让我竟是感到羞愧？好像自己做了什么惊天动地的事一样？        执着一根香，撒下一碗酒，三拜三叩，泪融于酒，我如若痴人。        照礼我是不必披麻戴孝的，只需戴着那顶白色的帽子即可。沿着幽僻的小路，我跟着吹着小号开路的队伍走在末尾。        风景甚好，埋在那棵大树底下，你会不会成为那树的枝，树的叶？ [四]感怀       死生有命，无可更改。谋事在人，成事在天。任你生前浮华万千，到头来不过一抔尘土，一捧青灰。愿逝者安息，生者恬淡。       有时候我们看不到自己拥有的美好，直到失去才恍然叹息。逝者已矣，页已掀过，惜福、感恩，生活其实温暖如花。       花开半夏，倾尽繁华，愿你回眸半刹。你可听到我在同你夜话？"

Humans of Macquarie iGEM
These are the stories of those who instruct, advise, and inspire the Macquarie_Australia iGEM team.
Instructors
""My research interests include exploring the difficult - large, dynamic macromolecular protein complexes using reporter labelling methods. EPR, FRET, NMR, and diamonds! Nanodiamonds can be isolated and made to emit light. They have biomedical applications, can be used as biomolecular tags, for ultrasensitive imaging and sensing technologies.""
(Dr Louise Brown - Sydney, Australia)
""My research career has concentrated on the biosynthesis and metabolism of chlorophyll and heme in bacteria, plants, and algae. This research lead to the discovery of chlorophyll f, investigations into the structure and assembly of a complex molecular machine involved in chlorophyll synthesis, and studies into developmental regulation in algae and plants. An additional interest in the plant hormone abscisic acid has lead to proteomic investigations of cereals like wheat and barley and studies on the function of proteins in bran layers of cereals.""
(Associate Professor Robert Willows - Sydney, Australia)
""My research interests have focused on understanding microbial physiology and evolution, in particular in utilising ""big picture"" or global approaches such as genome sequencing, bioinformatics, microarray analysis, high throughput cloning, gene knockout, and phenotypic screening. Click here to see my blog ""
(Professor Ian Paulsen - Sydney, Australia)
""My research focus is investigating the post-translational modification of proteins with sugars, termed glycosylation. Glycans are presented on most proteins of the cell surface and are the first molecules involved in many biomolecular interactions. They are thus integral to multiple cellular and biological processes such as cell communication and development, cancer metastasis, blood coagulation, host immune response, host-microbe interactions and fertility.""
(Professor Nicki Packer - Sydney, Australia)
""I have a background in both molecular biology and computing science, and am interested in the interface between the two. I am particularly interested in the use of computational intelligence techniques to design synthetic genetic circuits. Research interests include: systems and synthetic biology, computational intelligence and machine learning, molecular biology of Bacillus subtilis.""
(Dr Jennifer Hallinan - Sydney, Australia)
Advisors
""I practically live in the lab! Between doing my PhD and advising this year's iGEM team, there's not much time I get outside the lab. I have been involved with Macquarie iGEM team for a few years now, and it's been great to watch it grow over the years.""
(Edward Moh - Sydney, Australia)
""I am currently a lab demonstrator here at Macquarie for a range of molecular biology subjects. I advised the 2014 team and experienced iGEM as a student myself in 2013 when I was a part of the Macquarie_Australia team, 'Green is the new Black'. While I happen to have worn this same shirt in my photo last year it is only one in my collection of nerd shirts.""
(Mike Gibbs - Sydney, Australia)
Thi is a Scientific Officer with Macquarie University. She is excellent at sourcing consumables such as competent cells, GelRed, and LB broth - especially when we accidently contaminate all our stocks. Sorry Thi, we will try not to do it again.
(Thi Huynh - Sydney, Australia)
""iGEM alumni here! I was part of the Macquarie 2014 team, and I am back this year as an advisor. I graduated recently and mostly work from home, so I can always come and help out with the dry lab side of things. Fun fact: Breakfast food and F.R.I.E.N.D.S (the TV show) are two of my most favourite things in the planet.""
(Amit Bhattacharjee - Sydney, Australia)
""After the phenomenal success of our team last year, I am back again as an advisor. I graduated at the start of the year, and I just began working as a Business Development Associate for an executive advisory firm. I love my fitness and music; you will always find me with headphones on while I am working!""
(Robbie Hewetson - Sydney, Australia)
Microorganisms of Macquarie iGEM
""The team refers to me as their Hydrogen Hero, aww shucks - I'm just an Escherichia coli trying to do my bit for the planet. What great weather today, lots of sunshine - my favourite. The colourful building behind me is our campus Library. This is a special building not only because it has robots , but because it has a green roof to capture rainwater!""
(Burpey Bacterium - Sydney, Australia)
Seen here enjoying the iconic lake of Macquarie University is the eukaryote Chlamy. This single-celled green alga has provided the genes for our chlorophyll and photosystem II pathways.
(Chlamydomonas reinhardtii - Sydney, Australia)"

We are Macquarie_Australia
Yes that’s right - we are from the land down under.  In the Southern Hemisphere it is not only cylones that run the opposite way, our Summer break runs between December - February.  Alas our Winter break (29th June - 24th July) was the only time that we could dedicate to iGEM outside of semester.
We are not your typical iGEM team. This is partly due to team membership being integrated into coursework.  Our instructors Louise Brown and Robert Willows wrote a journal article about the strategies and challenges for iGEM teams in the Southern Hemisphere.  For a copy of this article ""Training the Next Generation of Synthetic Biologists – iGEM"" in the journal Australian Biochemist click here [PDF 298 KB] .
Macquarie University
Our institution is renowned for its interdisciplinary research , teaching, highly-skilled graduates, and first-class facilities . Macquarie University was founded in 1964 by the New South Wales State Government and was the third university to be founded in the metropolitan area of Sydney.
In 2014, Macquarie University celebrated its Golden Jubilee , commemorating 50 years of always challenging traditions and finding innovative ways to encourage education and research.
The North Ryde campus is home to the state-of-the-art Macquarie University Hospital , as well as the Macquarie Graduate School of Management .  Macquarie University has recently invested in infrastructure to offer students and researchers the best technology and facilities such as the Australian Hearing Hub , a student-focused building called MUSE , and a sustainable Library featuring a robotic book storage and retrieval system. The University’s Department of Chemistry and Biomolecular Sciences is a proud supporter of our undergraduate research project.
Our City - Sydney
Home to the iconic Sydney Opera House and Harbour Bridge , Sydney is the state capital of New South Wales .  Sydney is located on the East coast of Australia and has a wide array of experiences to offer - from bushwalks along the Harbour to relaxing escapes in the Blue Mountains , from scaling the Harbour Bridge to swimming at the iconic Bondi beach ."

(Dinh Tang - Sydney, Australia)
""During the break between first and second semester I spent nearly every day in the lab because I wanted to help the project progress. I made an off-hand comment once ""these gels are not going to run themselves"" and the rest of the team haven't let me live that down!""
(Liam Steed - Sydney, Australia)
""Hello friends! My name is Phillip and I'm studying a Bachelor of Science and Bachelor of Education at Macquarie University. I'm strongly interested in science and teaching it. Science can be interesting but depends on how you approach and to engage more students in science is the true purpose of a science teacher.""
(Phillip Yu - Sydney, Australia)
""I've gone through my degree with the aim of ending up in cancer research, but I'm not sure if that's for me anymore. I have a growing passion for climate science, so it looks like I have many, many more essays to write as a student than I'd hoped.""
(Remy Shergill - Sydney, Australia)
""Hi I'm Rosie! I love biomolecular science, structural genomics and human biology. I would love to visit the Australian Synchrotron in Melbourne and contribute to structural protein discoveries. Anything DNA-related is my jam and I am so excited to be part of the Macquarie iGEM team this year.""

Macquarie University has provided me the chance to study here with a 100% fee remission scholarship for which I am eternally grateful to them. I believe if we can utilise our knowledge and abilities we all can contribute to make the world a better place. I dream to study further and excel in the field of medicine so that I can do greater good on a huge scale.""
(Ahmed Dehan - Sydney, Australia)
""Science (and Arts!) student by day and science communicator and debater by night. You'd assume that the intersection of the Venn diagram of my three majors of biomolecular sciences, politics, and philosophy would lead me to investigating the ethics of bio-warfare or something of that ilk, but I in fact look forward to an exciting and challenging career in science communication and engagement! I am thrilled to be part of this year's iGEM team to be able to work with a team of my peers, learn about other teams' projects, and to be able to experience an international science engagement initiative.""
(Anna Kosmynina - Sydney, Australia)
""I have been in Sydney for a couple of weeks now. A really nice city where people are very cool, even if I don’t always understand them :) But I am improving my English thanks to my new friends - whether with an Australian accent or not! I am a French student and I came here to do my ""summer"" - e.g. winter in Australia - internship to improve my experience in mathematical modelling, practise synthetic biology in the lab, and win the SYTYCS competition, of course...""
(Pascal Helson - Sydney, Australia)

Our team
consists of a lively mix of UCL students (and a high school student!). We come from variety of backgrounds but share the passion for synthetic biology. Get to know the people who stand behind the success of this iGEM project.
▼
Marta Napiorkowska
I am a recent UCL graduate with degree in Biotechnology who loves engineering life and is looking forward to be the part of the future shaped by synthetic biology. I am not quite sure how I happened to come up with the initial idea that then developed into our amazing project. My role in the team is to be a portable robotic platform for cloning and to help in creating an (almost) seamless wiki. In the future I want to continue tinkering with DNA in the lab and hopefully make some real world impact with it.
Jack Ho
I just finished my BSc in Molecular Biology and I love synthetic biology, EDM and burritos. Hence I joined the UCL iGEM team. I became interested in synthetic biology for its potential to solve real world problems and its diverse applications. I spend most of my time in the lab doing lots of lab things like cloning or something (I once used 42 falcon tubes!). When not in the lab (like never), I like to work on the wiki and modelling. Also, I drew the logo on the T-shirts we're wearing! :)
Lucas Von Chamier
I am a second year Natural Scientist, doing Physics and molecular Biology. I am interested in the fundamentals of the world, especially the origin of life and the make-up of atoms. This is essentially what interests me about synthetic biology and what made me take part in iGEM. Apart from science I am into 80s punk rock, birds and Kebab. I contribute to the team primarily with the world famous German sense of humour and secondly with my computational and lab skills.
Paloma Portela Torres
BSc Molecular Biology (2nd Year) I only found out about iGEM when the UCL 2014 team had already been formed, and ever since, I have held on to the idea of it as my little joy to look forward to. I enjoy learning how to make things, talking to people and taking pictures of the two. In iGEM I hang out in the lab, trying to do things quick and not make it too untidy. Once the lab closes I try to get in touch with people or play around with illustrations and videos.
Francisco Guimaraes
Second year biochemical engineering student. Interested in startups, innovation, programming, evolutionary biology, economics and understanding why things are the way they are. Former-future MD. Mostly involved in the entrepreneurship, human practices and software aspects of the project.
Mariola Sebastián
I’m a 1st year Biotechnologist, who loves biohacking, computers, and business. I have been working in the lab to get bring some cute synthetic bacteria to life. I have also been working on the commercialization of our project, and creating a startup that will knock your socks off.  In my free time I like watching funny movies, reading sci-fi, and designing machines.
If you see me in the Jamboree, come talk to me about entrepreneurship, astrobiology, and robot uprisings, or if you just want to change the world.
Marta de Lebrusant Fernández
I am a 1st year Biotechnologist and I decided to join iGEM in the first place because I love playing around with E.coli and the smell of agar plates. Besides being with my beloved colonies in the lab I enjoy working on Policies and Practice and organising events for our project. Once I get home I love chilling eating M&M’s, watching movies with Minions or reading comics. If you are interested in immunology, evolutionary genetics, saving the planet or you just love synthetic biology, I am the right person to talk to.
Yash Mishra
Yash Mishra of the House Parashar, the First of His Name, the Legend, Lord of Ligations, Polymath of the Old Smoke, Patron of Policies and Practice, Destroyer of Colonies, Grandmeister of Microfluidics, Father of Bactomen, and all-round humble guy.
P.S. I love cats!
Tika Malla
First year biochemist with budding enthusiasm in Synthetic Biology and hence a member of UCL iGEM 2015. Greatly inspired by Richard P. Feynman’s quote “ What I cannot create, I cannot understand” and iGEM is helping me do the same in the lab this summer ; create and understand and vice versa. In my spare time I binge watch series and if I decide to make my spare time productive, I go hiking or pick a book to read. Also I love exploring new places and learning new languages or at least attempting to.

Our Favorite Parts! ♥
Favorite Parts
RoxA - Rubber Oxygenase A
    Part BBa_K1819003 corresponds to the coding sequence of rubber oxygenase A (Rox A) from Xanthomonas sp. strain 35Y (Gene bank accession code: AGT20506.1 ). This 73 kDa protein is an extracellular enzyme that catalyzes oxidative C-C cleavage of poly(cis-1,4-isoprene) to a major product, 12-oxo-4,8-dimethyltrideca-4,8-diene-1-al (ODTD; C15 tri-isoprenoid), with specific activity measured as 0.3 mol min-1 per mg.
Figure 1- Polyisoprene stereoisomers
    Found not only in Xanthomonas sp. but also in other Gram-negative clearing zone formers, RoxA is structurally related to cytochrome c peroxidases and its function is associated to two covalently bound heme groups. Although recently characterized by Birke et al1, the exact enzymatic mechanism of rubber degradation by RoxA has not yet been elucidated.
Figure 2- Tridimensional structure of RoxA (PDB code 4B2N)
    Because Xanthomonas sp. RoxA is exported to the extracellular environment, its open reading frame contains a sequence that codes to a signal peptide flanking its 5’-terminus. We detected this region (amino acid residues from 1 to 20) using signal peptide predictor server4 ( www.compgen.org/tools/PRED-TAT ) and eliminated it to generate part BBa_K1819003  with the coding sequence of RoxA flanked by SacI and NdeI restriction sites. Such non-usual restriction sites may serve for cloning purposes that lead to expression of recombinant protein with no additional amino acid residue(s) between its coding sequence and the fused N-terminal tag. Part BBa_K1819003 was cloned in pSB1C3 plasmid and submitted to Registry of Standard Biological Parts.
Figure 3- Schematic representation of BBa_K1819003 insert
Lcp - Latex Clearing Protein
    Part BBa_K1819001 corresponds to the coding sequence of latex clearing protein (Lcp) from actinomycete Streptomyces sp. strain K30 (GenBank accession code: AAR25849 colocar link ). Other Gram-positive clearing zone bacteria also present this 42 kDa enzyme, which catalyzes rubber cleavage at the cis double bonds to multiple products ranging from C20 tetra-isoprenoid to at least C35 hepta-isoprenoid with measured specific activity of 1.3 mol min-1 per mg. Lcp contains an oxidized heme-Fe3+ not bound to dioxygen as in RoxA 2. Neither its structure nor its catalysis mechanism were determined until now.
Figure 4- Schematic representation of BBa_K1819001 insert
    Again, because Lcp is secreted by Streptomyces sp., it contains a 5’-signal peptide that was identified using signal peptide predictor server4 ( www.compgen.org/tools/PRED-TAT ). We removed this region from Lcp to generate part BBa_K1819001 flanked by SacI and NdeI restrictions sites. We also  submitted it to the Registry.
Linker+GFP
    To characterize expression and secretion of mature proteins, we designed a new part that combines GFP coding sequence with an N-terminal linker, which is 5’-flanked by NdeI restriction site. Such part may serve to other IGEM teams that would like to express a chimera C-terminally attached to GFP, which exhibits bright green fluorescence when exposed to light in the blue to ultraviolet range.
Figure 5- Schematic representation of BBa_K1819000 insert
    This part can be especially helpful in characterization of gene expression and parameter fitting, as we describe in our modeling section . It is, however, mandatory the addition of a Ribosomal Binding Site (RBS) before the protein linked in the linker+gfp genes. As shown in figure 6, missing the RBS simply produce background fluorescence as the protein linked to GFP will not be translated.
Figure 6- Usage of BBa_K1819000 without adding a Ribosomal Binding Site (RBS) before the linker+gfp genes. Gfp proteins will simply not be translated and no green signal is observed other than the background fluorescence (negative control).
TAT signal - Twin-arginine translocation signal
    Part BBa_K1819002 corresponds to a Twin-arginine translocation signal (TAT signal), which is 3’-flanked by SacI restriction site.  We believe that other IGEM teams may want to use TAT signal from E. coli in their own projects. Therefore, after cloning into pSB1C3 plasmid and sequencing, we will submit TAT signal coding region of hydrogenase-1 small chain precursor from E. coli as a new part in biobrick format (part BBa_K1819002). SacI restriction site will be add at the 3’ flanking region of TAT signal to link it at the first amino acid residue of the protein to be exported.

     She works in the Molecular Biotechnology group, studying structure-activity   relationship of drugs. On her spare time, she helps the iGEM project’s experimental part, working in DNA circuit construction. She believes that Science can turn the world into a better place for everyone.
Why iGEM: I believe that making part of a project which aims to use synthetic biology in order to solve an environmental problem can be really challenging, therefore, is an amazing experience for personal development.
Paula Maria Pincela Lins
Undergraduate Student in Physical and Biomolecular Sciences
     On her last year of college, she works in the Nanomedicine and Nanotoxicology group, with synthesis of multifunctional nanoparticles for biomedical applications. Paula always tries to help the team whenever she can, and her main contributions to the project were:  literature review in modeling and devulcanization, project presentation in Jamboré, and searching for sponsors to the team.
Why iGEM: I believe that the team gives me the opportunity to develop new abilities. Studying synthetic biology helped me to expand my horizons, going out of my comfort zone. I lost my fears of presentation, which is a big step for me. Learning  that,  this competition is a great opportunity  to increase my professional and personal experiences. I never thought I would enjoy studying modeling and working in Entrepreneurship!
Thiago Schiavo Mosqueiro

     Thiago is finishing his PhD in computational neuroscience, investigating mostly how the Brain conveys and codifies information. Although in a larger scale (millimeters to meters), mathematical modeling always has been Thiago’s passion, having briefly experienced Solid State physics, Financial Market, Neuroscience and Population Dynamics. He helped in the organization and discussion of results and designed all the predictions models of our project.
Why iGEM: Science itself is reaching that point where there aren’t anymore boundaries separating different areas of expertise anymore. In this sense, Synthetic Biology and Systems Biology appear to be the flagship towards multidisciplinarity. For this transition, modeling and data analysis are certainly on the spotlight. I thought iGEM would give me a chance to strengthen my knowledge base and expand my skills on modeling and data analysis. I could learn a lot with my teammates and contribute to make this huge project happen!
Letícia Camargo Tavares
Undergraduate in Physical and Biomolecular Sciences
     Leticia is currently working in the Medicinal and Computational Chemistry Group with neuronal ensembles involved in the context-induced reinstatement of ethanol seeking in rats. She has been helping the team mainly in scientific researches for project development, in topics such as : construction of the kill switch system, product transformation and bioreactors. She also aided iGEM by writing, revising texts and searching for sponsors.
Why iGEM: My participation in iGEM competition is giving me the opportunity to learn much more than I would learn just in the classroom. It has improved my ability to think and to join together different knowledge fields in order to build a whole project. Furthermore, it has been a really great experience to work with a team that has the same passion as mine: Science!
Fabiane Fantinelli Franco

Her contributions to the team were mainly: studying modelling, developing images for folders/banners/wiki and Jamboré’s organization.
Why iGEM: Since I found out about iGEM last year, I wanted to be part of it because I saw passionate people who believed in our potential to do great things. The exchange of experiences is one of the most important parts in group work: with our team I learned more about synthetic biology, modelling and even entrepreneurship. I believe that iGEM is an unmatched opportunity to represent Brazilian young students in an international competition and that we are doing our best to make this project be awesome.
Ana Laura de Lima
Applied Physics PhD Student
Physical and Biomolecular Sciences
     She is currently studying Trypanosoma brucei spliceosome as part of her PhD project in the Laboratory of Structural Biology. She helps in many areas of the iGEM project, but her main focus is on planning and executing wet lab experiments and on anything that involves drawing (wiki design, t-shirt, logos and the mascot). Her specialty is disturbing the weekly meetings with non-important topics.
Why iGEM: I decided to be part of iGEM mainly due to its contribution to my knowledge in molecular sciences and for the possibility to work in solving problems that affect society. Also, I spent the whole year of 2014 hearing my friends talking about how great it was the competition.
Ivan Rosa e Silva
Applied Physics PhD Student
Physical and Biomolecular Sciences
     Ivan is currently studying Trypanosoma brucei spliceosome at the Laboratory of Structural Biology of the Crystallography Group as part of his PhD thesis project. He was part of Brasil-SP wet-lab team in IGEM 2014 and is now helping our team with wet-lab, genetic circuit design and literature review. His contributions to the team are mainly related to molecular biology experiments design.
Why iGEM: I joined iGEM teams in 2014 and 2015 because I was interested in developing projects that aim to tackle major problems in human health and environment using synthetic biology.
Karen Freire Carvalho

     Karen, who is at the last year of her bachelor’s degree, has worked with Molecular Biology and is currently developing a project in the Microbiology field, which involves isolating and studying biosurfactant producing bacteria. She has helped the iGEM team mainly working in the wet lab, but she also aided by seeking contacts of potential sponsors and collaborators around the world and with text writing and revising.
Why iGEM:As it is my last year at college, I wanted to do something really special. When I heard of the possibility of being part of the team I recognized the perfect opportunity for that - and I couldn’t have been more right about it. It has been a wonderful experience, never thought I would be able to learn this much about so many things in so little time!
Cristiane Casonato Melo
Applied Physics Master student
Physical and Biomolecular Sciences
     She works in the Nanomedicine and Nanotoxicology group with the development and citotoxicology assessment of nanoparticles for biomedical applications. She has contributed to the team by helping with Jamboré’s organization, performing sponsors related tasks, carrying out literature review in bioreactors and modelling and participating on human practices and entrepreneurship activities.
Why iGEM: I think iGEM is a great opportunity not only to learn more about synthetic biology but also to do it. It also provides you the chance to improve other skills such as organizing events, working in a team and dealing with sponsors and deadlines, besides many others that are important for everyone’s professional life.
Camila Barbosa Bramorski
Undergraduate in Physical and Biomolecular Sciences
     Camila currently works in the Nanomedicine and Nanotoxicology group developing biosensors for biomedical applications that promise to diagnose and run tests in a cheaper, simpler and faster way than nowadays technologies. It is her second year on iGEM and she is very dedicated on finding a moment during the team meetings to make a (not always that funny) joke and she doesn't care if it costs her integrity. Besides that, she contributed with: starting the team, sponsorship tasks and meetings, human practices, Jamboré presentation, entrepreneurship, product transformation, circuit's study and scientific research.
Why iGEM: If I had to summarize iGEM in one word I would say ""complete"". Not the most impactful word but it fits perfectly. I will tell a short story of what is iGEM from my point of view and then it will be very clear “why iGEM”: iGEM starts with reading and learning about things you have never heard before. Synthetic biology lies on the border of knowledge, putting together different areas and it makes you think ""This is magical. I am so doing this"". There are so many creative projects that there seems to be no limits to creativity, and this is where the fun begins. The next step is to talk to your colleagues and start a team and, sooner than you expect: goodbye comfort zone. You have to present your ideas, to spread what is iGEM, what is synthetic biology and of course, what is your project to the public, to the university, to companies - and the list never ends. You start to improve your public communication skills. Then you need to help with the project development, read many scientific papers, and learn how to search and read them in a optimized way. The more you read, the more you realise you know nothing. Breathe, you are not alone. You share all the moments with your team and day by day you feel a friendship getting stronger. During the development of the project, you will need help and it will make you get in touch with awesome people. Probably for the first time in your academic life, you will talk to the community about your project and see, by your eyes, how it impacts the society and the planet. You will come back to the lab feeling even more motivated, as now you are sure that you are changing the world. You want the project to become real, so you take the next step and think about how to apply it, and it might bring you the first shot of real life and business. In the end of it, you will travel to the Giant Jamboree and live one of the most challenging and enriching experiences ever. You have learned (at least a little bit) of everything. Finances, design, documents, biology, physics, chemistry, engineering, communication, HTML, languages, entrepreneurship, poster, presentation, events, modeling, laboratory experiments and more. There is no way to tell in a few words how much you will learn and experience with iGEM. As I said, it is complete. That is my ""why iGEM"" and I am very glad of being part of it.
Jennifer Machado Soares

     Éverton is conducting his PhD at São Carlos Institute of Physics, in the laboratories of the Biophysics Group “Sérgio Mascarenhas”. The focus of his research is understanding signal transduction systems that control c-di-GMP, an important bacterial regulator. His main contribution to the project were in literature review, the design of DNA circuits and execution of lab experiments.
Why iGEM: The competition is a great opportunity to learn about new topics in molecular biology and other areas. Additionally, I can have contact with some applied science in real time, turning iGEM into an exciting experience.
Deborah Cezar Mendonça
Undergraduate in Physical and Biomolecular Sciences
     Deborah works at the Crystallography Group in the structural analysis of Superoxide Dismutases of Xanthomonas citri subsp. citri, etiological agent of citrus canker. She is in the last year of her course.  Her contributions to the team are mainly in experimental area, in particular the execution and organization of wet lab experiments, besides the literature review about exportation systems.
Why iGEM: This is an opportunity to experience a new area of knowledge that has become very important in Biotecnology. Moreover, it is an space to practice our own ideas, expand knowledge and learn interesting new subjects that can be used in future projects.
Victor Henrique Rabesquine Nogueira
Undergraduate in Physical and Biomolecular Sciences
     He’s been working with synthesis and characterization of nanomaterials and biosensors in the Nanomedicine and Nanotoxicology Group. On his second year in the competition, he helped whenever he could. His main contributions were on human practices events, and Jamboré organization.
Why iGEM: The opportunity of being part, again, of an iGEM team and get really into a synthetic biology issue was amazing, specially because of the chance to learn a lot about all the aspects a transdisciplinary project like this can reach. Besides, the impact on our society this project can cause is also a great motivation.
Bruno Andrade Ono
Applied Physics Master student
Physical and Biomolecular Sciences
     Bruno works with photodynamic therapy for the treatment of melanoma at the Research Center in Optics and Photonics - CePOF. On the team, he has helped to plan and discuss characterization results and, as everyone, in the development of the DNA circuit. He has also assisted on the organization of the third Jamboré, the meeting between iGEM brazilian teams.
Why iGEM: For me it is fascinating to program an organism in order to solve diverse problems in the society. One of the reasons why this is fascinating, is because it can generate considerable short-term impact. In addition, iGEM is a competition that brings together people from different areas of science and provides that each of them leave a contribution and enrich the project.
Laís Ribovski

Her contributions to the team and project are mainly in fund raising, manage team’s work, characterization experiments, literature review and proofreading.
Why iGEM: iGEM is a place where you can be creative, meet great people and do some awesome teamwork, besides you can learn a lot from others.
Camila Maria dos Santos Boralli
Undergraduate in Physical and Biomolecular Sciences
     On the last year of graduation, Camila is currently studying about Trypanosoma brucei spliceosome as a part of her scientific project. Her main contribution to the team was in the experimental part, more specifically in the execution of the wet-lab experiments. Additionally, she has helped with the literature review in exportation systems.
Why iGEM: I became interested in being part of the team last year, when I found out about the competition. For me, iGEM is a great opportunity to learn a lot about synthetic biology itself, and how to apply that knowledge. Moreover, I believe that being part of this team will increase my personal and professional experiences.
Danilo Keiji Zampronio
Masters Student
Physical and Biomolecular Sciences
     From a wet lab slave in 2014 to a policy and practices member in 2015. What an interesting shift of activities. Danilo is an enthusiastic person graduated in Physics and Biomolecular Sciences and is currently starting his Masters project in bacterial bioplastic production at the University of Sao Paulo. Recently he has moved from São Carlos (hometown of the iGEM team) to São Paulo, which makes it a bit harder to directly participate in the wet lab and meetings,  but whenever he comes to São Carlos he is always gushing rainbows of happiness to try boosting up the team’s stamina.
Why iGEM: The answer is simple and deep at the same time. In iGEM we can be real creative researchers without having to present all the academic credential! iGEM is Science at it’s most fun and genuine form.

Liam Carroll
A first year Biomedical scientist with a penchant for puns and an inability to not make them at   the worst possible times; interested in the medical applications of every technology ever. Has   only ever beaten Eggy twice at chess after more than 50 games. Is terrified of Aneesa’s daily   beatings. Official title: Lab monkey.
_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Matthew Chester
Matthew has recently graduated in Biological Sciences and has research interests in climate   science and epidemiology. Matt will be using his Northern charm to whip the members who are  more into chess than anything else into shape with the ambition to win.
_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Iain Galpin
A Biochemist between undergrad and a Masters programme, Iain has a tendency to bodge  together things that just should not be created. He is interested in the challenge of research, as   well as the future applications. Official title (in his head at least): ­ Mad Scientist.

Part Collection
2015 Peking iGEM has not only transformed the sequence information into detectable bioluminescence, but also explored a wide range in which Paired dCas9 (PC) Reporter System is able to be applied. Since we have chosen split enzyme as our reporter, it can be substituted by various kinds of enzymes, thus the  form of read-out will be abundant at the same time. That is, our PC reporter system has successfully provided a platform to produce a variety of signals.
We combine the specific sequence binding activity of dCas9 with diverse characteristics of split enzymes, thus creating a part collection named ""PC Reporters Collection"".
The Collection includes:
dCas9-split luciferase Parts
Nluc-dCas9 (BBa_K1689010)

SBiDer: Synthetic Biocircuit Developer
Abstract
Genetic circuits are often difficult to engineer, requiring months to design, build, and test each individual genetic device involved in the circuit. SBiDer, a web tool developed by the UCSD Software iGEM team, will leverage existing devices to construct a database with consideration for the function of each device interpreted as boolean logic. The data can be queried by the user through SBiDer's visual interface to explore circuit designs. Users can search for existing circuits that can be used to assemble a complex circuit. The displayed circuit's literature reference, characterization data, and images of included devices can be viewed through the built-in table. We also provide a standalone modelling Python package that can be used to model circuits given by our online webtool. SBiDer's web of information can be expanded through user-generated additions to the database to improve the efficiency of the application and the accuracy of the models.
Project Description
Problem Statement
Synthetic genetic circuits created by synthetic biologists have yielded exciting applications such as biofuels production and cancer killing bacteria. These circuits are often difficult to engineer, requiring months to design, build, and test each individual genetic device involved in the circuit. Although there are many genetic devices that have been built, re-using these devices often requires a time-consuming review of the literature. The UCSD Software iGEM team will address this challenge by creating a web-tool that leverages existing genetic devices to create complex genetic circuits. We will accomplish this by:
building a comprehensive database that captures the behavior, composition, and interactions of existing genetic devices in the literature
constructing and visualizing the network of all synthetic genetic circuits that can interact with one another
devising algorithms to search this network for the set of genetic devices that can be used to construct a complex genetic circuit.
Perform some basic validation via kinetic modelling.
Aim 1 - Building a Database
We will mine the scientific literature for existing genetic devices and then construct a database that captures device characteristics such as:
composition of devices
function
characterization data
literature reference
We will design our database by rigorously constructing an entity relationship diagram and then normalizing these relationships to construct tables for a relational database.
Aim 2 - Constructing Network of Interacting Devices
We will connect known genetic devices together via device input and outputs to create a network of devices that can interact. We define a genetic device as a DNA construct transformed into cells that can cause expression of some protein in response to stimuli (or input). We will  develop a web interface to facilitate access to the complex network that we have constructed. Our Web interface makes extensive use of Cytoscape, an open source bioinformatics software package for metabolic network visualization and simulation.  In addition, the interface will generate SBOL Visual Images, a standard language that is easily understood by synthetic biologists all over the world.  Users can also update our database with additional devices through this interface.  Using the Cynetshare framework, users can share their circuit designs
Aim 3 - Searching the Network
This interface will allow researchers to query our database network for a circuit design expressed as logical operators such as “AND”, “OR”, and “NOR”, and retrieve the subnetwork of genetic devices that satisfies the circuit design. To Perform our search  we modified several traditional graph search algorithms to traverse this graph, including but not limited to Prim’s algorithm (minimum spanning tree), Dijkstra’s algorithm and a breadth-first search. Results are visualized graphically in our web interface.

THE TEAM
SAFETY & PROTOCOLS
Meet the team!
This summer I worked on the wet lab components of our project including experimental design and data analysis.
Hi! My name is Joanne Wu and I am a rising senior pursuing a degree in Mechanical Engineering. I joined iGEM because I think there is a lot to learn from nature in designing more adaptive, resilient, and efficient systems.
This summer I led our team’s efforts in exploring our problem space and iteratively refining our project goals. My interest in STEM education and engagement led me to spearhead the lesson plan component of our project. For this endeavor I worked closely with Gabe to first understand the biology behind our biosensor and then with various educators to figure out the most effective way to present this information. My interest in civic engagement prompted me to work closely with Muntaha to refine our Antimicrobial Footprint app. I also created and delivered our presentation at the iGEM symposium with Gabe and put together this wiki.
Hi! My name is Muntaha Samad and I am a third year at UC Davis studying Computer Science and Engineering.  I am very interested in mobile deep linking, and the idea of making the app world fluid like the web. I also really enjoy robotics and am interested in pursuing a career working with smart prosthetics.  In my free time I enjoy playing ultimate frisbee and working for the UC Davis C-STEM Center. I decided to join iGEM to gain more experience programming in the context of solving biological problems.
This summer I produced an app that calculates your antimicrobial footprint and raises awareness about the unnecessary and potentially harmful ubiquity of antimicrobials in our environment.
Hello, I am Logan Vinson a fourth year Genetics and Genomics major at UC Davis. My career interests include genetic monitoring and breeding selection for endangered species and populations under inbred depression and genetic bottleneck. In my spare time I enjoy rock climbing and engineering. I first found out about iGEM while i was at my junior college by my biology professor. She told me about the competition after i had expressed interest in genetic manipulation and synthetic biology. Ever since then i had made it my personal and professional goal to compete in iGEM.
This summer I worked on genetic assembly and integration, expression and protein purification. I also helped with outreach and data collection.
Hi, my name is Andrew. I’m currently pursuing a degree in Computer Science with a minor in Biochemistry. I enjoy working on problems that integrate computer science and biology, both hardware and software. My professional interests include automation and scientific instrumentation. In my free time I enjoy working on cars and welding.  I joined iGEM for the experience of using biology to solve a real world problem.
This summer I worked on several methods of quantifying the signal produced by our biosensor. I also contributed to the outreach of the project and sample collection.
Hi. I am Andrew Michelmore, a second year Electrical Engineer at Santa Clara University. I am very interested in the engineering and design of power grids, as well as in transistor organization for processors and microprocessors. I hope to pursue a career in one of these areas. I decided to join iGEM, because I was interested in the engineering approach and view iGEM has towards biology.
I contributed to the project mostly through outreach and wastewater collection. I also assisted with hardware and hardware testing.
University of California Davis, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Medicine and School of Medicine
My scientific efforts are focused on combining computational and experimental tools to develop a fundamental knowledge of enzyme catalysis, and applying those principles to design novel proteins of therapeutic or commercial interest. Currently I am working with an international community on the development of Rosetta computational methodology for predicting and designing macromolecular structures, interactions, and functions. Using this methodology I have completed the de novo design of enzymes capable of catalyzing chemical reactions not found in nature, such as the Diels-Alder reaction. This was followed up by working with an online community, Foldit, to further engineer these proteins for enhanced activity. Most recently I have worked on the redesign of naturally occurring enzymes for the degradation of immunogenic gluten proteins, to develop a novel CO2 fixation pathways, and design of a novel anthrax therapeutic. My current focus is on the design of novel biofuel and commodity chemical biosynthetic pathways, the development of novel therapeutics, and the general understanding of the relationship between protein sequence, structure, and function.
University of California Davis, Department of Computer Science and UC Davis Genome Center
My lab’s interests span a variety of topics related to evolutionary, synthetic and systems biology. We employ machine learning, graph theory, mathematical optimization, multiscale modeling and HPC simulation methods to address questions in these fields. Computational predictions are experimentally tested in our microbiology lab, where we perform laboratory evolution of microbial cultures, and we construct novel synthetic gene circuits for biotechnological applications.
University of California Davis, Department of Biomedical Engineering and UC Davis Genome Center
I are interested in using the tools of Systems Biology to elucidate rules of biological assembly for gene regulatory networks and in turn use this knowledge, through Synthetic Biology approaches, to build novel circuits.
University of California Davis, Department of Biomedical Engineering
I have been an advisor to UC Davis iGEM teams for the past 5 years and have enjoyed every minute of it. I am currently manager of the UC Davis Biomedical Engineering Molecular Prototyping and BioInnovation Lab. We provide a dedicated space for students interested in synthetic biology to pursue and implement projects within the synthetic biology realm.  My primary interest is to improve mentorship and educational opportunities for students interested in applications of systems and synthetic biology.
University of California Davis, Biophysics Graduate Group
University of California Davis, Department of Biomedical Engineering
I graduated from UC Davis with a degree in Biomedical Engineering and hope to one-day own my own biotechnology business.
University of California Davis, Microbiology Graduate Group
I'm a microbiology doctoral student in [Jonathan Eisen's         lab](https://twitter.com/phylogenomics/). I am interested in         studying large-scale migration patterns of microbes. Currently,         I am using cichlid fish as a model system for investigating how         host-microbe associations have evolved over deep time. Advocate         of Free Software, Open Hardware, Open Access scientific         publishing and reproducible research.

Throughout this project we were working independently of professors and faculty advice.  From start to finish we built the project ourselves.  We conducted the background research and carried out experiments within our own ability.  Any help from faculty or professors was all conceptual in troubleshooting protocols and experiments.  The Policy and Practice was done by law students without the advice or guidance of professors.  They reached out to other teams and established everything on their own.In it's entirety this is a completely and solely student built project.
We have many people we would like to thank for their help in the design, execution and support of this project.  These groups and individuals offered a helping hand as we maneuvered through our first year competing in iGem.  So from our entire team to all of you we thank you from the bottom of our hearts.
Santa Clara University Provost Office
We would like to thank the Provost office for funding our endeavors for our project this year.  Without their help we would not have been able to transform our idea into reality.
School of Engineering
A special thank you to the School of Engineering for kick starting us and allowing us to be nestled under their wing to facilitate building of our team and project. Specifically the Dean Godfrey Mungal for believing in us from the very beginning.
Bioengineering Department
Thank you to the bioengineering depart for their support and use of facilities as we worked this past summer on our project.
Linda Kahl
Linda has been a great help in the entirety of the planning of our project from the very beginnings to the very end.  Thank you for all your help and sharing this experience with us.
Tracy Ruscetti and Christelle Sabatier
Dr. Ruscetti and Dr. Sabatier of the Biology Department have been a great help with the design and troubleshooting of our project.  Without them we would not have been able to complete as much as the project as we did.
Biology Prep Room Staff
We would like to extend a huge thank you to the biology prep room staff. They graciously allowed us to use their space and equipment, and offered support for our project. They also assisted us with ordering everything we needed for our project. In addition we would like to thank the Bioengineering Lab Manger Adrian Valones, not pictured, for his assistance with ordering as well. If it were not for these people we would not have been able to successfully complete our project this year.
Jonathan Zhang
Dr. Zhang has been a great advisor as we work through all the problems along the way.  He has been there through all the planning, frustration, and joy as we completed our project.
Bill Mains
Without Professor Mains we would not have had the opportunity to compete in iGem this year.  He approached us and asked if we would like to be a part of this wonderful opportunity.  Because of that we are where we are now.
Friends and Family
Lastly without the support system of our family and friends none of us would be where we are today. Their love and moral support has kept us afloat through the rough times and they were there to celebrate with us when we succeeded.  Thank you for everything.
Sponsors
The last group we would like to thank is our sponsors. These companies allowed us to pursue our project to the fullest through funding and other support systems."

Alec Lourenço
My name is Alec Lourenço, and I’m a junior at La Canada High School. I got interested in synthetic biology as a freshman and then participated on the Caltech 2014 team as a sophomore. Now I’m glad to have the opportunity to work on this fantastic team this year!
Fun Fact: I am an absolute sucker for teas. I’ll Chai any type of tea, just as long as you don’t steep it Oolong. Oh, and I’m also from Florida
Christos Menemenlis
Hi! My name is Christos, a freshmen at La Canada High School. I don't really matter, I just try to juggle school and everything else at the same time. I am interested in life, learning, and something that I don’t have. Science is just a really interesting discipline to me, and the more I study and learn about how it affects our lives, the more interested I get. I guess it’s just natural curiosity.
Fun Fact: Only 8 people I have ever met have pronounced my last name correctly on the first try… five of them were my own family.
Miles Yun
Hello. My name is Miles “Sung-Joon” Yun. I am currently a freshman at LCHS. I enjoy science and history. I am a great public speaker. I delivered the graduation speech at my middle school graduation ceremony. I am a five time national winner in a nationwide fine arts competition. I enjoy sports a lot, I run and swim, I enjoy physically demanding workouts, and I enjoy reading a lot.
Fun Fact: I have traveled to over two dozen countries. I went on a science expedition to the Galapagos Islands with my dad for a NASA earthquake project and had to ride a horse for eighteen hours straight in order to visit all the stations around the volcanoes on the islands.
William Fu
Hi I’m William Fu, and I’m a junior at La Canada High School. I am interested in math stuff and modeling stuff. I am interested in biotech and mathematics, so I’m here  to experience a less esoteric subject (mostly did cluster computer and math stuff) for modeling and I want to take my computers out for a spin again. I am glad to have the opportunity to work on this fantastic team this year! (If needed I can also write iphone/android apps too, same w/ Rudy)
Fun Fact: I drink tea. Also most people call me wfu (woo-foo). It’s not wufu, that spelling is incorrect.
Rudra (Rudy) Menon
Hi I’m Rudra Menon, I am a junior at La Canada High School. I am very interested in computers and more specifically, computer programming. I have found myself to be more compatible with computers than living things. For example, I’ve recently become engaged in coding artificial intelligence simply because I wanted to play board games with something that doesn’t try to converse with me. I am beginning to fear my obsession has whittled away at my ability to connect with breathing beings on an emotional level. I am joining the biotech team in desperate hopes to get back in touch with natural life. This is primarily so I can learn about “real” life on the basic level in order to one day create a master race of bits and bytes.
Fun Fact: When I’m not playing connect four with myself I enjoy playing ultimate frisbee. I find the sports scene to be a remarkable opportunity to observe the peculiar behavioral patterns of animate beings.
Matthew Yu
My name is Matthew Yu and I’m a junior at La Canada High School.  I am highly interested in synthetic biology/biotechnology and science in general.  I have taken various synthetic biology/biotechnology classes over the past few years and I look forward to having fun on this amazing iGem team this year!
Fun Fact: I love music and I can play 7 different instruments, of which piano is my main.  I can speak in 9 different languages, but most is quite limited.  I know how to play 4 different sports and enjoy each one of them.
Cathey Seo
Hey! My name is Catherine Seo, but people call me Cathey. I’m a senior at La Canada High School and I love math and science. I love music, sports (specifically tennis), and learning new things. I’m really grateful and excited for this amazing opportunity and look forward to what this year has!
Fun Fact: I live at Panera or my friend Caitie’s house and I LOVELOVELOVELOVE boba/pearl tea.
