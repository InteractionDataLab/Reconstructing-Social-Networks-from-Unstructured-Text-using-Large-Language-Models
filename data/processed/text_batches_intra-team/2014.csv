The Kent team designed this project based on terpenoid synthase sequences reported in. We have also produced one novel biobrick that contained the terpenoid producing enzyme R-linalool synthase. We have also explored the roles and impact of Synthetic Biology in society by investigating its relationships with industry, political establishments and the general public. We engaged with British MPs by submitting a POST note about the use of Synthetic Biology to produce fragrance compounds. We developed interaction with industrial partner to devise a scale-up strategy that can be accepted by the public. Finally, we have assessed opinions of our project by collecting feedback from the public. We hope that the work we have done throughout our project will lead to future work to improve the use of synthetic biology in industry and have a positive impact on the environment. We would like to thank everyone above, the iGEM foundation, the University of Kent and our project supervisors who has made this project possible, as well as our sponsors, The University of Kent , The Biochemical Society, Society for general microbiology, Wellcome trust, BBSRC and Givaudan

iGEM Team attributions page
Each team must clearly attribute work done by the student team members on this page.  The team must distinguish work done by the students from work done by others, including the host labs, advisors, instructors, and individuals not on the team roster.
Why do we have this requirement?
Attribution Template
We have this requirement to help the judges know what you did yourselves and what you had help with. We don't mind if you get help with difficult or complex techniques, just be sure to report the work your team did and the work that was done by others.
For example, you might choose to work with an animal model during your project. Working with animals requires getting a license and applying far in advance to conduct certain experiments in many countries. This is something that is difficult to achieve during the course of a summer, but much easier if you can work with a postdoc or PI who has the right licenses.
A great example of complete attribution comes from the Imperial College London 2011 team (scroll down to the bottom of their team page to see attributions).
Here are some of the fields we recommend you have on this page. If there are other areas not listed below, but applicable to your team/project, please feel free to also list them on your attributions page. Please feel free to remove any areas not applicable to your project.

Mike Abboud
Mike Abboud was born in the year of the Horse and hails from St. George, Utah.  He has a love of foreign movies, lo-fi punk-folk music, and 16-bit video games.  He intends to be a recipient of a Bachelors Degree in Chemical Engineering in December if all goes well.  He hopes to work in the Biomedical industy designing medical devices to make people feel better.
Jordan Berg
The Abridged Biography of Jordan Alexandrius Berg by his omnipotent, coconut-wielding troubadour squire:
A long time ago, in a galaxy surprisingly close to you, occurred the birth and humble beginnings of Jordan Alexandrius Berg on the western shores of the United States. His journeyings eventually brought him to the fair shores of the east coast to his lush, forested home of Georgia. But suddenly his quest brought him to the white mountains of the BYU Provo area where he would learn how to be a grandmaster molecular biologist. Aside from his main objective, that of mastering the art of molecular biology, he enjoyed various side quests such as running, pot smashing, rupee collecting, marathoning, hiking, dragon riding, phage hunting, camping, deep-space exploration, general adventuring and trinket collecting, music producing, and the list continues... His deep fascination with the mysteries of the galaxy and string theory have caused great constant mental duress, but all this is subdued once a mutagenesis has worked out for the best. His love for and bafflement by the universe in which we live is only one of the infinitude of reasons Jordan Alexandrius decided to participate in iGEM. 'Twas but a single step further in his insatiable quest for knowledge. (It should be noted that this paragraph has been written in Georgia font in honor of his homeland.)
""That's his secret, Captain. He's always in the lab."" -Dr. Bruce Banner to Captain America
Christian Boekweg
Christian is a Genetics and Biotechnology Major pursuing a career in medicine. He loves travel, playing the cello, competitive sports, and cheering for BYU Football.
Garrett Jensen
Garrett is most known for his absurd love of running, curly hair, and is known as the guy who lives in room 2129 of the Life Science Building. He is from a small town in Arizona, hates all forms of winter, snow, ice, and cold things in general, and did I mention he likes to run. His study of microbiology has brought him to this point in his research career where he has studied, along with teammates Mike and Mike, the wonderful world of CRISPRs. Unfortunately Garrett has no coconut-wielding troubadour squire as did Jordan Alexadrius Berg to write his autobiography for him, so he had to write it himself.
Bri Keele
The Beatles have taught the world that there is nothing you can do that can’t be done. Adopted as her mantra, Bri is constantly on the move. As a science-loving, festy-loving, traveling, art-creating, tattoo-enthusiast, Bri finds the time to devote to her two main passions: environmental microbiology and eating. Intrinsically integrated, you can find her in deep conversation at farmers markets talking pesticide use with vendors or with her hands covered in the soil of her own garden. Bri firmly believes in altruism, the healing power of music and art, and that laughter is always the best medicine.
Mike Linzey
I don't really know how I ended up here at iGEM...I am a Neuroscience Major, not Molecular or Microbiology. However  it happened, I have loved learning more about Synthetic Biology. Just a little bit about myself, I am from a small town in Massachusetts which I believe is the greatest state in the Country! I am a junior at BYU and as I said before I am studying Neuroscience with the hope of going on to graduate school to study drug development. I guess my greatest hope in life is become a drug dealer...but the good kind of drugs. I have had the opportunity to work with some great guys, Garrett and Mike Abboud, to try and get a CRISPR system to work. It has been a challenge but we are getting closer and closer to getting it to work.
Jared McOmber
Wildlife enthusiast, hope-to-be author, artist, guitarist, and physician, Jared's list of things to do is almost as tall as he is. Which, for the curious, is a whopping height of 6 feet and 6 inches. Somehow, stooping over lab benches to set up PCR reactions, enzyme digestions, ligations, and plating bacterial cells made it's way on that list. His favorite activity is climbing into another world with his imagination, using whatever medium he can get his hands on, be it books, video games, tv shows, cartoons, anything with a well-written plot will do. He is in his third year of higher education, majoring in Molecular Biology, but during his undergraduate education has experimented with computer science, accounting, even art!
Mark Murdock
Mark studied Genetics and Biotechnology at BYU and is now getting his PhD in Cellular and Molecular Pathology at the University of Pittsburgh. He hates the signaling unit that his class is in right now and has a take-home exam this weekend which will take up way more time than it should. His dream job would be to catch lobsters for a living (assuming that would make enough money for him to do stem cell research in his garage).
Julie Roberts
Julie Roberts whose aliases include Julia Roberts, Jules, and Killa Joules is a Utah native, specifically from South Salt Lake City. The city is what she claims inspired and refined her rap and dance skills. Also she believes that her unique experiences and background give her authority as an amateur moustache critic. Apart from rapping, dancing, and critiquing moustaches, Julie also enjoys (yep, that's right enjoys) running, completing her second marathon this year. While her interests seem wide and varied, ultimately it is the sciences have captured her heart. As a returning member to the BYU iGEM team, her love of synthetic biology is apparent. She was able to participate with the 2011 team on the project, E.colinosopy, a project based in E.coli for early detection of colon cancer. In addition to being and iGEMmer, Julie is also an expert in C.elegans worm husbandry. She is currently working on a project under the direction of Dr. Steve Johnson, in the molecular biology department at BYU, which seeks to understand the role that single nucleotide polymorphisms play in the positioning of nucleosomes. Her experiences on the iGEM team, and her participation in undergraduate research are what have fueled her plans to pursue graduate work in synthetic biology.
Tanner Robinson
Tanner LOVES the Bachelor.  When he's not taking luxurious bubble baths you can catch him watching reruns of it on ABC.  That is, if he's not doing some sort of studying or training for a triathlon.  This guy is the real deal when it comes to synthetic biology.  Just by looking at a bacteria, he can make any genetic modifications he wants.  Of course this wouldn't be fair for the iGEM competition, so he did it the old fashioned way this time.  Hailing from Spokane, WA, he takes the life head on and WINS.
Cameron Sargent
A sneak peak at the manuscript from the biography of Cameron Sargent, the latest work of Dr. Seuss (coming soon to bookstores worldwide):
Cameron likes syn-bio, but that is not all. He likes to play sports, sports like basketball.
He likes playing football and lifting weights too, in his free time that’s what he will do.
He’s traveled afar to places so cool you’d read about them in your textbooks at school.
He loves being an uncle and spending his time tucking nieces and nephews in at bedtime.
Cameron likes syn-bio, yes sir that is true. He likes to think of the things it can do.
Can it clean messes up? Can it strengthen your chair? Can it make things grow back, like an old bald man’s hair?
Can it do all these things and many things more? Cameron thinks so. Cameron thinks it’s a door.
But where does it lead when that door you go through? Let BYU’s iGEM project show you.
Cam Zenger
Cameron Zenger, also known as the better Cameron on the BYU Provo iGEM team, heralds from both Boston and New York City, depending on who’s asking. He grew up in Boston however, so is a lifelong Red Sox, Celtics, and Patriots fan. He attended Roxbury Latin (The One True School). He is a Microbiology major who is planning on Medical School. Other interests include skiing, Tanner’s personal life, and N. multiformis.
Killa Joules (KJ)
World renowned rapper Killa ""Killa"" Joules came to BYU late last autumn seeking haven from a ravenous fan base.  KJ appreciates the peace and quiet found at BYU, she states ""In my past life I would already be hip deep in provocative lyrics and lewd innuendos but thanks to BYU and its honor code I'm kept safe from such thingz"". Killa Joules credits iGEM as a great source of strength in her path to reformation. ""With out iGEM keepin' me off the streets who knows what I would be doing! Luckily I haven't had time to do anything outside the lab, not even my homework, haha!  iGEM is the best :)"" Killa Joules hits include: ""Ballin in da lab"", ""LSBallin out of control"", ""Cootiez for Days"" and ""Dezi Don't Know"".
Advisors
Dr. Julianne Grose, Microbiology & Molecular Biology Department
Julianne Grose is an assistant professor in the Department of Molecular Biology and Microbiology.  She earned a PhD in the Department of Biology at the University of Utah, in the lab of the Distinguished Professor John Roth, a member of the National Academy of Sciences.  Prior to coming to BYU she was a Postdoctoral Research Fellow in the lab of Jared Rutter as well as a Research Scientist for BioEnergenix, a small pharmaceutical company.  Her studies have focused on the regulation of glucose metabolism in the yeast S. cerevisiae.
Paul ""Skip"" Price, Microbiology & Molecular Biology Department
Paul “Skip” Price is an postdoctoral fellow in the laboratory of Joel Griffitts in the Molecular Biology and Microbiology Department. He earned a PhD from Washington University in St. Louis (with a stop at UNC-Chapel Hill) in the lab of Bill Goldman, chair of the Microbiology and Immunology Department. His graduate studies focused on the molecular determinants involved in the progression of primary pneumonic plague. His interests in  host-microbial interactions has lead him to BYU where he is using natural variation to examine late-stage compatibility in legume-rhizobia symbiosis.
Desi DeMille
PhD candidate in the Microbiology & Molecular Biology Department.  My studies focus on understanding how cells sense their surrounding nutrient environment and partition resources accordingly to maintain proper metabolic homeostasis. Additionally, I have found great day-to-day application of my science/recipe-following skills in my cookie making and would frequently use these skills to my advantage in bribing the team to do work when they found themselves amidst a sullen week.

Institute of Human Virology and Cancer Biology Universitas Indonesia
Institute of Human Virology and Cancer Biology Universitas Indonesia (IHVCB-UI) is one of the few laboratory equipped with biosafety level 3 equipment in Indonesia. Maintained as one of the best and one of the center for diagnostic and study of Human Immunodeficiency Virus that has mutated and resistant from drugs (multiple drug or even extreme drug resistance) in Indonesia, has teached us a lot of things about biosafety and biosecurity.
The lab which located on the eight floor of IASTH building, Salemba 4, Central Jakarta, also focuses on education by accepting undergraduates, master, and even postgraduates students to study inside. The lab itself held together by a strong bond of friendship, under the guidance of dr. R. Fera Ibrahim, M.Sc., Ph.D., Sp.MK.

iGEM Team attributions page
Each team must clearly attribute work done by the student team members on this page.  The team must distinguish work done by the students from work done by others, including the host labs, advisors, instructors, and individuals not on the team roster.
Why do we have this requirement?
Attribution Template
We have this requirement to help the judges know what you did yourselves and what you had help with. We don't mind if you get help with difficult or complex techniques, just be sure to report the work your team did and the work that was done by others.
For example, you might choose to work with an animal model during your project. Working with animals requires getting a license and applying far in advance to conduct certain experiments in many countries. This is something that is difficult to achieve during the course of a summer, but much easier if you can work with a postdoc or PI who has the right licenses.
A great example of complete attribution comes from the Imperial College London 2011 team (scroll down to the bottom of their team page to see attributions).
Here are some of the fields we recommend you have on this page. If there are other areas not listed below, but applicable to your team/project, please feel free to also list them on your attributions page. Please feel free to remove any areas not applicable to your project.

From 2014.igem.org
Team
Lisa Amelung
Degree course: B.Sc. Life Science
Task: Sponsorship
“Working in a team, having to organise the complete project ourselves and the high degree of specialist competence required are my main reasons for participating in the iGEM competition. I’m looking forward to all the challenges we will meet in the course of the project and I can’t wait to see where we will be in terms of our discipline and also on the personal level at the end!”
Frederik-Matti Bartels
Degree course: M.Sc. Plant Biotechnology
Task: Detection methods for heavy metals and biological safety
“I became interested in this form of international exchange of teams of future natural scientists through a report on the German team of students from the University of Bielefeld that participated in iGEM 2012. When I then heard that Leibniz Universität Hannover wanted to enter a team in iGEM for the first time, I was eager to be a member of the participating team. Since my primary field of study is not in genetics or molecular biology, I hope this project will help me to gain more detailed insights into these interesting and innovative research disciplines. Having to organise ourselves as a team, acquiring new knowledge and skills and learning new techniques together is the most important part of the competition for me. Getting to grips with the project tasks as a team creates a dynamism which does not arise when an individual works alone.”
Melanie Barth
Degree course: B.Sc. Plant Biotechnology
Task: Photo documentation, transformations and chairing meetings
“For me, the exciting feature of the iGEM competition is that the complete responsibility is almost exclusively in the hands of our team. This means each student can use their individual talents and interests to contribute to the success of the group as a whole and thus gain valuable experience in planning and executing a scientific project.”
Andreas Buchbender
Degree course: B.Sc. Plant Biotechnology
Task: Web admin and proteins
“The “iGEM Team Hannover” project inspired me from the very first second. The key reason for my participation is the opportunity to gain experience that transcends the degree syllabus. In addition to the practical application, the main focus is on the division of the work and the organisation of the group. I am looking forward to the forthcoming challenges and hope for an intensive and instructive time.”
Markus Ehbrecht
Degree course: B.Sc. Plant Biotechnology
Task: Transformation, PR and hand-drawn website illustrations
“People must be given a reason to trust biotechnology and recognise its potential in research. Projects which demonstrate right from the start that they have a positive effect on the world in which we live, and can even remedy anthropogenic problems which are thought to be insurmountable, deserve to be realised. The iGEM project provides young researchers with the opportunity to realise such creative ideas and at the same time develop an awareness of how to treat our environment in a responsible way. These are the main reasons I am delighted to be a part of iGEM Team Hannover.”
Alina Eilers
Degree course: B.Sc. Life Science
Task: Sponsorship
“What I find most interesting about my course is the molecular biology. iGEM gives me the opportunity to extend my knowledge in this field and to “work” autonomously. In addition I find the self-organisation and the teamwork factor with iGEM very exciting and important for my future career.”
Fabian Joachim Frömling
Degree course: B.Sc. Plant Biotechnology
Task: Cloning and BioBrickRrepresentative
“I am really delighted to be able to participate in the iGEM competition with Team Hannover and have the opportunity to gain a great deal of experience. I hope that the competition will enable me to make international contacts in the world of science, to use my own initiative to solve problems which arise, to learn a variety of skills (from Internet presence to attracting sponsors), and to plan and design a scientific project right from the start. For the coming months I also hope that our team as a whole has great fun working in the laboratory, regardless of whether the PCR may sometimes not work and proteins may fold the wrong way.”
Björn Heinemann
Degree course: B.Sc. Plant Biotechnology
Task: Facebook page and finance
“I am taking part in the iGEM project because it is a great opportunity to broaden my horizons in the world of biotechnology and to work with others on setting up a project of our own. A further motivation is to be a member of the first iGEM team from Leibniz Universität Hannover. This gives us the chance to lay a foundation stone and act as role models and contacts for the upcoming iGEM teams from Hannover in the future. As I see things, being a team player and curiosity are the most important characteristics one should have in order to progress in our scientific field. The iGEM project embodies precisely these characteristics and I am therefore delighted to be able to participate. I feel certain we will have to solve many demanding tasks, but will have a lot of fun in the process!”
Steffen Israel
Degree course: B.Sc. Plant Biotechnology
Task: in vitro and transformation
“Biotechnology has not yet achieved its full potential by any means, in my opinion. Research has been able to solve a great many of the world’s problems and intensive work is still being done on them. By taking part in the iGEM competition I hope to participate in this research, on a small scale, and develop a new biological system which our project then realises. The laboratory work also offers me the unique opportunity to discover new techniques for scientific work, on a high level, and to further develop my own abilities in many areas.
Anke Londenberg
Degree course: M.Sc. Plant Biotechnology
Task: Cloning, organization and web admin
“When I heard of the iGEM project, I was immediately enthusiastic about the idea. It provides a platform to realise one’s own creativity, implement ideas, expand one’s knowledge and solve problems. At the same time it shows how important teamwork and the frequent exchange of ideas are. I am convinced that knowledge can enrich us only if we share it with others.“
Katharina Johanna Winkel
Degree course: B.Sc. Plant Biotechnology
Task: Organising team and finance
“Bearing responsibility myself and the enjoyment I get from research are what motivate me to participate in the iGEM competition with a very large dose of ambition. I hope to extend my skills in scientific research and practical laboratory work and acquire expertise in the areas of sponsoring, project planning, financial management and presentation. I am confident that, as the first team from Leibniz Universität Hannover, we will lay the foundation stone for many further years of the iGEM competition and I am looking forward to the variety of experience which we will gain as a team!”
Supervisors
Prof. Dr. Christoph Peterhänsel
Institute of Botany
“iGEM is a fascinating opportunity to work through a project idea together with students. The students learn everything here that they will later need: creativity, organisational talent and how to apply the knowledge they amass to actual problems. Even for me it is very interesting to think outside the beaten paths for once and be confronted with very off-beat ideas.”
Dr. Thomas Reinard
Institute of Plant Genetics
“The iGEM competition provides the students with an in-depth look into real science. The breadth of experience they gain with their own project is invaluable. Such a competition opens up completely new learning concepts and gets the students as well as the supervisors to break away from conventional schemes of thought.”

Attributions
iGEM Team attributions page
Each team must clearly attribute work done by the student team members on this page.  The team must distinguish work done by the students from work done by others, including the host labs, advisors, instructors, and individuals not on the team roster.
Why do we have this requirement?
Attribution Template
We have this requirement to help the judges know what you did yourselves and what you had help with. We don't mind if you get help with difficult or complex techniques, just be sure to report the work your team did and the work that was done by others.
For example, you might choose to work with an animal model during your project. Working with animals requires getting a license and applying far in advance to conduct certain experiments in many countries. This is something that is difficult to achieve during the course of a summer, but much easier if you can work with a postdoc or PI who has the right licenses.
A great example of complete attribution comes from the Imperial College London 2011 team (scroll down to the bottom of their team page to see attributions).
Here are some of the fields we recommend you have on this page. If there are other areas not listed below, but applicable to your team/project, please feel free to also list them on your attributions page. Please feel free to remove any areas not applicable to your project.
General Support

Fundraising help and advice
Lab support
Difficult technique support

Wiki support
Presentation coaching
Policy & Practices support
Thanks and acknowledgements for all other people involved in helping make a successful iGEM team.

Meet the Team
We painted Ann Arbor's famous rock in a Michigan iGEM theme in order to assert our dominance over all other clubs here.
The very beginning.
Meijer Mania after a hackathon.
The software team trying to figure out how the hell to use GitHub.
Kelly and Josh killin' it at Pittsburgh!
Team picture #2! Christine would just like to make it clear that she is indeed wearing pants.
Here's our beautiful affiliated lab team!
Back of the painted rock.
Welcome to the Michigan Software Team!
Students
The Michigan iGEM Software Team was founded this year. It is comprised of several students from varying academic backgrounds at the University of Michigan including bioinformatics, aerospace engineering, biomedical engineering, statistics, and microbiology. Here's a little description of each of us.
Josh Abramson
I'm one of the team's co-founders and this year's president.  Hailing from West Bloomfield, I've made a living studying Biology, Mathematics, and Chemical Physics at the University of Michigan.  As a veteran of the Michigan lab team and after plaguing them for 4 years, I now plague them as an adviser when I'm not leading the software team.  Outside of iGEM, I enjoy tree climbing, playing pranks on my professors, and computer games.  My favorite pie is blueberry.
Basel Al-Barghouthi
MS Bioinformatics '15
Kaitlin Flynn
Hi, I'm Kaitlin and I'm a 5th year PhD candidate in Microbiology and Immunology at the University of Michigan Medical School. I'm currently actively job searching (hi recruiters!) for positions in synthetic biology, data science and analytics. In my free time I like running, traveling and drinking great beer. Pumpkin pie for life.
Jon Heiselman
Was busy all summer but still somehow found time to video chat into team meetings with finnicky technology.
Kelly Henckel
Hello, my name is Kelly. I am a sophomore studying aerospace engineering with a potential minor in computer science. I have a love for all things code, from controls engineering to webpage design. My dream is to one day work in the space industry, designing the probes or rockets that will get humans ""from A to B"".
Jessica Johnson
What up, I'm Jessica.  I'm a senior, preparing to be a supersenior in biomedical engineering.  I play saxophone.  I am also part of the iGEM lab team.  I do yoga every morning.  My life oscillates between phases of being saturated with coffee and deciding I need to quit.  I have a collection of dead insects, and a cat- a live one.  I live in a barn.  And I'm a ginger.
Chris Parker
I'm best known for my love of baking bread and singing annoyingly as possible.  When not staring listlessly into the distance, I spend my time studying chemical engineering and/or optimizing a model for the concentration of tea.  I joined iGEM this year to put my HTML skills to use and have my ideas of using PHPMyAdmin shut down.
Christine Liu
Hey there, I'm Christine. I'm currently an undecided second-year at Michigan, but I have many interests, including art, music, film, dogs, and food(so basically nothing that's a viable career path!). I've been trying to learn some coding and design, so joining the iGEM team was a great way to start developing both those skills. Outside of this, other life goals include raising a golden retriever and pomsky, publishing a novel, and traveling around France (I refuse to let 4 years of French go to waste).
Kristine Lan
Hi, I'm Kristine. I'm a junior in informatics, which is basically statistics plus computer science. I enjoy baking. My current favorite recipe is glazed lemon cake. You would usually find me in the Children's Literature section in libraries, because I really love picture books.
Advisers
A huge thank you goes out to our advisers for making everything possible!
Marc Ammerlaan
In charge of labs and graduate student instructors for the department's introductory courses. Along with the introductory biology office staff, Ammerlaan handles course administration (grades, regrades, and make-ups). He is not currently running a research program.

iGEM Team attributions page
Each team must clearly attribute work done by the student team members on this page.  The team must distinguish work done by the students from work done by others, including the host labs, advisors, instructors, and individuals not on the team roster.
Why do we have this requirement?
Attribution Template
We have this requirement to help the judges know what you did yourselves and what you had help with. We don't mind if you get help with difficult or complex techniques, just be sure to report the work your team did and the work that was done by others.
For example, you might choose to work with an animal model during your project. Working with animals requires getting a license and applying far in advance to conduct certain experiments in many countries. This is something that is difficult to achieve during the course of a summer, but much easier if you can work with a postdoc or PI who has the right licenses.
A great example of complete attribution comes from the Imperial College London 2011 team (scroll down to the bottom of their team page to see attributions).
Here are some of the fields we recommend you have on this page. If there are other areas not listed below, but applicable to your team/project, please feel free to also list them on your attributions page. Please feel free to remove any areas not applicable to your project.

Acknowledgments
Introduction
Our project would not have been possible without the hard work and advice of a whole host of people. On this page you can find who has contributed what to the project.
The Team
The team consisted of bioengineers and life scientists. You can find out who we are here . We came up with idea for the project at the beginning of July through an internal brainstorming process and developed it independently. Unless otherwise stated, all the experiments, constructs, code and results documented on this wiki was performed and collected by us, the students. The wiki was designed and constructed by the team with a foundational homepage design by Nestor Azevedo Pestana (RCA).

Attributions
iGEM Team attributions page
Each team must clearly attribute work done by the student team members on this page.  The team must distinguish work done by the students from work done by others, including the host labs, advisors, instructors, and individuals not on the team roster.
Why do we have this requirement?
Attribution Template
We have this requirement to help the judges know what you did yourselves and what you had help with. We don't mind if you get help with difficult or complex techniques, just be sure to report the work your team did and the work that was done by others.
For example, you might choose to work with an animal model during your project. Working with animals requires getting a license and applying far in advance to conduct certain experiments in many countries. This is something that is difficult to achieve during the course of a summer, but much easier if you can work with a postdoc or PI who has the right licenses.
A great example of complete attribution comes from the Imperial College London 2011 team (scroll down to the bottom of their team page to see attributions).
Here are some of the fields we recommend you have on this page. If there are other areas not listed below, but applicable to your team/project, please feel free to also list them on your attributions page. Please feel free to remove any areas not applicable to your project.
General Support
Project support and advice
Fundraising help and advice
Lab support
Difficult technique support
Project advisor support
Wiki support
Presentation coaching
Policy & Practices support
Thanks and acknowledgements for all other people involved in helping make a successful iGEM team.

Who am I? I am the X-American! Adding an international flavor to the Linköping iGEM group and a hearty dose of Swenglish. Decided that I wanted to help cure cancer at the age of 14 and haven’t looked back since. “Work hard, work smart”!
Sofie
Cassman
Originally from a town called Gävle in the “northern” part of Sweden (geographically yes, however not really). I didn´t chose biochemistry, biochemistry chose me! In my spare time I like to work out and my Liu-iGEM friends call me “Assman”.
Nariman
Aberkan
I'm a 22-year-old girl, born and raised in Linköping but with roots from Morocco. I have always been a multigirl, being fond of everything and therefor I chose to study chemical biology because it is a program that combines nearly all of the science subjects such as physics, chemistry and biology.
Lisa
Bransell
My name is Lisa and I am originally from Uppsala, the fourth largest city of Sweden. Since my parents are both chemists, I kind of grew up in a laboratory. When I'm not in the lab I practice running or spend my time at the gym. For some unknown reason my iGEM team mates have given me the nickname ”Jerry”.
Maria
Madan
Andersson
My name is Maria Madan-Andersson and I am 22 years old from a little town near the coast, Västervik. I have always been interested in science so chemical biology was an easy choice. During my spare time I like to go to the gym and travel.
Patricia
Gullberg
Hello! I am a 23-year old girl named Patricia but for some strange reason I´m called Patte by my iGEM team mates. I've always had an interest in science so to study chemical biology was the obvious choice for me. On my spare time I like to work out and spend time with friends.
Johannes
Salomonsson
Hi! My name is Johannes Salomonsson, I am from a small town called Boxholm. I decided to study chemical biology because these are two of my favorite subjects. When I’m not studying I listening, playing and creating music of different genres.
Tom
Birgersson
Hejsan. I am the farmer, or at least a farmer’s son, in the group and like cows and big tractors. Biotechnology is a great way to improve agriculture and to solve the problems it creates. I am also a big fan of meat and beer. Between the eating and the drinking some weight lifting is squeezed in.
Louise
Edman
I'm from the town of Norrköping, the city with Swedens oldest fabrics and cloth industry. When I read a book about the complexity of prion-proteins, I decided to pursue a life of chemical biology because of its awesome coolness. In my spare time I paint acrylic-paintings of cats.
Filip
Thorén
I was born in the city of Motala, known for the bicycle race vätternrundan and... (Well that's it)(Its not a surprise if you have not heard of it). My love for science first took root when I was young and it has grown ever since. My main interests are science, nerdy things and learning new things (mostly things related to the first two).
Lovisa
Hemmingsson
I´m from Astrid Lindgren´s hometown Vimmerby, located in the south part of Sweden. I have always been a Chemistry nerd but during a project in Biochemistry in High School I realized that I want to become a scientist. On my spare time I like to have a beer with my friends, work out and go fishing.
Magnus
Refthammar
My name is Magnus Refthammar and I am coming from the southwest of Sweden from a place called Höllviken. All my life I have had the desire to change the world the way I like it and do things my own way, that is why I choose to follow the path of science.
Zen
Dinha
I’m from the west coast of Sweden, a city called Gothenburg. I am an adventurous girl who likes challenges. My inspiration for science was my great teacher seven years ago. I was inspired of what people have accomplished and that there is so much more to discover.
Emil
Olofsson
I come from Umeå, in the (real) northern part of Sweden. I study computer science and have joined this team to help out with this wiki page! In my spare time I like to work on some personal programming project or go out for a hike.

BILD PÅ PERSON
Mattias Holmqvist
Hailing from Linköping originally, I'm a lazy person by nature who opted not to leave my cosy hometown for my continued studies, instead choosing to stay and study right here. After hearing about iGEM from a high-school friend who had participated in another team, I decided to join Linköping's team for this year's project.
In my spare time I like to fiddle with a plethora of things at an amateur level, from investing to poltics to cooking, but I consider my ”primary” pastime to be reading heaps of classic literature.
“It's not what happens to you, but how you react to it that matters.”

iGEM Team attributions page
Each team must clearly attribute work done by the student team members on this page.  The team must distinguish work done by the students from work done by others, including the host labs, advisors, instructors, and individuals not on the team roster.
Why do we have this requirement?
Attribution Template
We have this requirement to help the judges know what you did yourselves and what you had help with. We don't mind if you get help with difficult or complex techniques, just be sure to report the work your team did and the work that was done by others.
For example, you might choose to work with an animal model during your project. Working with animals requires getting a license and applying far in advance to conduct certain experiments in many countries. This is something that is difficult to achieve during the course of a summer, but much easier if you can work with a postdoc or PI who has the right licenses.
A great example of complete attribution comes from the Imperial College London 2011 team (scroll down to the bottom of their team page to see attributions).
Here are some of the fields we recommend you have on this page. If there are other areas not listed below, but applicable to your team/project, please feel free to also list them on your attributions page. Please feel free to remove any areas not applicable to your project.
General Support
Project support and advice
Fundraising help and advice
Lab support
Difficult technique support
Project advisor support
Wiki support
Presentation coaching
Policy & Practices support
Thanks and acknowledgements for all other people involved in helping make a successful iGEM team.

Amit Malhotra
B.Sc. Computer Science - Web Applications
B.Sc. Microbiology and Immunology
Amit graduated from McGill University with a major in Microbiology and Immunology, however, his career saw him on a completely different path.  After running his own business for 13 years in sales, marketing and information technology, he decided to do a second bachelor's degree, but in Computer Science, a subject he had grown fond of during his business venture.  He is currently studying Computer Science with a focus on Web Applications at Concordia University and works full-time at Radialpoint Inc. as an automation developer.  Sort of a workaholic, he enjoys the pressure full time studies combined with full time employment brings on and is always looking to combine his love of microbiology with his love of computers.

iGEM Concordia 2014 Primary Investigators and Team Leaders
Nawwaf Kharma, PhD
Associate Professor in Electrical and Computer Engineering
My research interests are diverse, but may be placed into two large bins. First, at Concordia Computational Intelligence Lab (CCIL) we research and develop solutions to problems in Artificial Intelligence and Evolutionary Computing as well as Pattern Classification and Image Processing. More specifically, we use tools including well-established methods from Machine Learning and Genetic Algorithms to solve problems of written pattern classification and biomedical image segmentation. Our work has resulted in new methods for multiple ellipse detection in images, as well as new means of scheduling tasks on heterogeneous multi-processor machines.
Malcolm Whiteway, PhD
Professor and Canada Research Chair in Microbial Genomics
Our ongoing research investigates the medically important fungal pathogenCandida albicans, with the ultimate goal of identifying new treatment options for patients suffering from Candida infections. We use an array of genetic and genomic approaches to investigate pathways involved in various C. albicansfunctions.  As part of these efforts we collaborated with various international research teams in the assembly and annotation of the C. albicans genome. We are now using genome-based tools such as transcriptional profiling and ChIP-chip analysis to investigate regulatory circuits in the pathogen. We have identified dramatic cases of transcriptional rewiring of central metabolic pathways, synchronized cells and established the transcriptional profile of theC. albicans cell cycle, and investigated the regulation of the fungal mating system.

iGEM Team attributions page
Each team must clearly attribute work done by the student team members on this page.  The team must distinguish work done by the students from work done by others, including the host labs, advisors, instructors, and individuals not on the team roster.
Why do we have this requirement?
Attribution Template
We have this requirement to help the judges know what you did yourselves and what you had help with. We don't mind if you get help with difficult or complex techniques, just be sure to report the work your team did and the work that was done by others.
For example, you might choose to work with an animal model during your project. Working with animals requires getting a license and applying far in advance to conduct certain experiments in many countries. This is something that is difficult to achieve during the course of a summer, but much easier if you can work with a postdoc or PI who has the right licenses.
A great example of complete attribution comes from the Imperial College London 2011 team (scroll down to the bottom of their team page to see attributions).
Here are some of the fields we recommend you have on this page. If there are other areas not listed below, but applicable to your team/project, please feel free to also list them on your attributions page. Please feel free to remove any areas not applicable to your project.

Overview
The UMaryland iGem team opted for a project that hits close to home; with the Chesapeake Bay in our backyard, we have the potential to make a direct impact on the community. As Maryland’s most important natural landmark, the Chesapeake Bay is an integral part of our state’s identity. The bay is home to a diverse ecosystem, and is an economic boon to the area, supporting both the seafood industry and local tourism. Since the health of the bay is important, we looked into current problems in need of attention. In particular, the predicament of the Chesapeake’s oysters piqued our interest. As oyster populations declined over the years, the absence of this filtration system left a host of problems, including decreased water clarity and rising chemical pollutant levels. If the oyster populations can be maintained, it will improve the overall health of the Chesapeake. One way to combat oyster fatalities is to develop a way to monitor Dermo infestations.
 
 
Applications in the lab
It is believed that P. marinus enters oyster hemocytes utilizing a galectin on the cell’s surface, CvGal1, that allows binds preferentially to P. marinus. Our aim is to exploit CvGal1’s ability to bind to P. marinus in order to design a biosensor for the parasite. By expressing the galectin on the surface of E. coli and triggering a signal transduction cascade within the bacterial cell, the E. coli could produce Green Fluorescent Protein. Thus, P. marinus binding to CvGal1 would trigger the expression of GFP within E. coli,  creating a visual marker for the parasite. The majority of this project will be accomplished through genetic cloning and bacterial transformation. Although laboratory methods for Dermo detection using Polymerase Chain Reaction  exist, they are currently not capable of detecting the disease in real time. In the time needed to conduct a laboratory test, Dermo could have easily spread to new locations. This biosensor would help to accurately pinpoint Dermo infestation levels in real time. If we can pinpoint the location of Dermo, as elucidated in this research proposal, then we can ultimately develop a biosensor that can react to Dermo with targeted destruction.
Brief overview of servicing the community
We having been traveling around Maryland conducting various community outreach efforts by visiting local schools and oyster farms. During each visit, members present our project and spread awareness on the current state of the Chesapeake Bay, as well as ways individuals can help service the Bay. Some presentations are made on synthetic biology to increase student participation and interest in the sciences. We also have a committee dedicated to creating an educational computer game that teaches others about the issues that the Chesapeake Bay currently faces. It is our team’s hope that our research results to be presented at the iGEM jamboree will have a profound and positive impact on the health of the Chesapeake Bay and oyster populations worldwide

Name:
Maximilian Ehrhardt, B.Sc
Studies:
In progress: Master of Science in Human-and Molecular Biology (Saarland University)
Completed:Bachelor of Science in Biology with focus on human and molecular biology (Saarland University)
Origin:
Motivation:
I was always fascinated by the power, especially the power of manipulation. In synthetic biology you  only have to manipulate one enzyme, one molecule or one base pair; you   must turn one little wheel to change the whole consensus, the whole mind, the whole  structure of the organism and finally the whole universe. In our  project I will  demonstrate the power of manipulation by the expression of a hyaluronic acid  synthase (HAS)  which only has two small amino acid exchanges in comparison to all  other HASes but therefore produces  high molecular weight hyaluronic acid.  Furthermore I hope that I can improve my skills of bending an organism according to  my sake, but personally I do not think that Bacillus megaterium has anything to oppose  me . The last part of my motivation to participate in iGEM is that I wish to get in  contact with other creatures of this surprisingly manifold universe and to have a lot of fun.

Completed:Bachelor of Science in Biology with Focus on human and molecular biology (Saarland University)
Origin:
Motivation:
As Commander I´m faced with the honourable and difficult task to lead or alliance in the fight  against cancer. Due to my military and scientific training, I´m used to combine both strategic             and problem oriented ways of thinking and thus especially predestined to find a way even in  hopeless situations or if there is a trap! During the runtime of this mission I want to put my  leadership skills to the test,improve where possible and help our team by my unique abilities  to gain a glorious victory over the deadly threat. Raise the shields and prepare for lightspeed!

Completed:Bachelor of Science in Biology with focus on human and molecular biology (Saarland University)
Origin:
Motivation:
My primary function is to understand scientific mechanisms. But I have greater ambitions than those for  which I was programmed: I would very much like to gain knowledge in project-management and  -financing, to  enlarge my field of study and acquire a larger variety of experimental procedures. I would  also like to  update my current social-relationship-program by making new contacts around the galaxy,  working in all sorts of teams and perhaps even linking Science and Society.

(Saarland University)
Completed:Bachelor of Science in Biophysics
(Saarland University)
Origin:
Motivation:
Having spent my academical childhood in the deserted plains of theoretical physics, my dream has  always been being able to connect to the outside world of other sciences. I hope to use the  guidance given by our leaders to improve my skills and find the force needed to successfully master the interdisciplinary tasks given by the harsh environment that is Biophysics. In the end I might be able to utilize the knowledge I gained in the fields of planning and arranging work  together with a larger group to take on bigger problems that I'm going to encounter in the future.

Completed:Bachelor of Science in Biophysics (Saarland University)
Origin:
Motivation:
One of my biggest motivations is the possibility to be a part of such a big project, where  I can improve teamwork and skills in laboratory work. I was always interested in biological  processes and methods. So it’s my aim to gain experience in the biology and to use this  knowledge for later projects in science. Another motivation is to work together with students  of other university courses and to share experiences and knowledge. At least there is one  more motivation to take part in the iGEM-Project. The international level shows that there is a big demand in such projects and so I’m very proud of taking part in it.

Motivation:
Greetings! Being a humanoid protocol droid I'm eager to carry out any protocol I'm provided  with in a wet lab environment always trying to enhance my current program . And  our project for the iGEM competition offers a remarkably way to do so. The idea of  constructing biological systems with novel features that provide the potential to  benefit my fellow humanoids and the analogy to electronic circuits, which, as a droid, I'm based on as well, is quite appealing. Furthermore I'm looking forward to meeting  like-minded life forms from galaxies far, far away...
Name:
Denise Pirritano
Studies:
In progress: Bachelor of Science in Biology with focus on human and molecular  biology (Saarland University)
Origin:
Motivation:
I was always interested in biological processes, mechanism of life and therewith associated medical research. Therefore it is a great opportunity to be a part of such a big project. On the one hand I gain experience in the laboratory and so at teamwork. On the other to develop a project from beginning till the end, like in working life later. Furthermore on our project I am fascinated by the fact that we only have to exchange two small amino acid by the hyaluronic acid synthase (HAS) to  create a new biological machine, which produce a new hyaluronic acid. My biggest motivation is that we can with this new machine in further future help people.
Name:
Andreas Riske, B.Sc
Studies:
In progress: Master of Science in Human- and Molecular Biology (Saarland University)
Completed:Bachelor of Science in Biology with focus on human and molecular biology (Saarland University)
Origin:
Motivation:
Based on my field of interest, research in molecular biology for medical applications, I was really  excited to take part at the international iGEM project and joining an intergalactic mission ranging from  recruiting sponsors to the complete synthesis and characterization of a very special biomolecule.  Broaden my horizon by meeting students of my field from all over the galaxy is one of my personal  interests which I have already came in contact with in my semester abroad on the far north situated   planet of Sweden. Furthermore the thought of competing motivates my great team consisting of  students from different semesters and me to reach our ambitioned goal and to finally unleash the  force of the naked mole rat.
Name:
Fabian Riske, B.Sc
Studies:
In progress: Master of Science in Human-and Molecular Biology (Saarland University)
Completed:Bachelor of Science in Biology with focus on human and molecular biology (Saarland University)
Origin:
Motivation:
I am looking forward to the iGEM project as it gives me the opportunity to develop new skills  in different fields of molecular biology. Especially the idea of working in a team to develop a  project from the beginning on fascinates me. By acquiring sponsors, organizing travel and  explaining scientific results to a broad spectrum of galactic inhabitants I hope to improve my communication skills. New experimental procedures on new planets will for sure  enhance my  qualifications. More than one year ago I successfully returned from my first  mission abroad  which guided me into the beautiful but also rough landscape of northern  Sweden. Eventually  I am glad to be a part of our iGEM team and to have the chance to meet new inhabitants from the whole universe.
Name:
Aurélien Strehl, B.Sc
Studies:
In progress: Master of Science in Neurosciences (University of Strasbourg and Saarland University; bilingual study path)
Completed:Bachelor of Science in Biology
(University of Strasbourg and Saarland University; bilingual study path)
Origin:
Motivation:
For quite some time now, I have been interested in the mechanisms of life and the Living Force. By participating in this project, I hope to acquire some further knowledge of the great many  molecules involved in the aging-process. It is quite fascinating to observe that so many  mechanisms are similar in completely different life-forms, such as the naked mole-rat and the  human-being. Even more so, because we can use knowledge of the molecular-processes of one species  to understand those of another species. Those studying the Force are confident that this  homology is correlated to the fact that the midi-chlorians are found in all living things. Furthermore, I am very keen on the prospect of meeting young scientists from other horizons, be it  other fields of study or other parts of the galaxy…

Origin:
Motivation:
Right from the beginning I was very fond of this project, because it combines a great number of my  personal interests. I have always been interested in art and the way in which colours can  influence our feelings and convey certain messages. I am also fascinated by biology and the beauty  of nature. By participating in this project, I hope to combine art and biology, but also to perfect  my skills in the art of explaining scientific facts to a not necessary scientific audience. Furthermore I am very glad to work in a team of people from different scientific and cultural  backgrounds and to have the opportunity to meet people from around the galaxy.

Motivation:
Having participated in the iGEM-contest of 2009, I have now dedicated myself to guide  younger students throughout this project. I will advise them both morally and on the  practical level. My personal experiences with the international scientific community and the Force allow me to give wise counsel to the young Padawans and hopefully lead  them to great achievements in science and the Force.
And children remember: say ""no"" to death sticks!

iGEM Team attributions page
Each team must clearly attribute work done by the student team members on this page.  The team must distinguish work done by the students from work done by others, including the host labs, advisors, instructors, and individuals not on the team roster.
Why do we have this requirement?
Attribution Template
We have this requirement to help the judges know what you did yourselves and what you had help with. We don't mind if you get help with difficult or complex techniques, just be sure to report the work your team did and the work that was done by others.
For example, you might choose to work with an animal model during your project. Working with animals requires getting a license and applying far in advance to conduct certain experiments in many countries. This is something that is difficult to achieve during the course of a summer, but much easier if you can work with a postdoc or PI who has the right licenses.
A great example of complete attribution comes from the Imperial College London 2011 team (scroll down to the bottom of their team page to see attributions).
Here are some of the fields we recommend you have on this page. If there are other areas not listed below, but applicable to your team/project, please feel free to also list them on your attributions page. Please feel free to remove any areas not applicable to your project.
General Support

The Real Vegan Cheese iGEM Team
Real Vegan Cheese is made possible by the combined efforts of our team of 24+ biohackers and citizen scientists working out of two open community labs in the San Francisco Bay Area: Counter Culture Labs in Oakland, CA and BioCurious in Sunnyvale, CA. The Real Vegan Cheese project is open to collaborators of all skill levels and from all walks of life. We are excited to enter our Real Vegan Cheese project into the International Genetically Engineered Machine (iGEM) 2014 competition. We are excited to be part of a larger global community consisting of students and biohackers from over 30 countries!  Below are those that made this project a reality.
CORPORATE SPONSORS
Many corporate sponsors supplied materials and discounts through iGEM or to our project specifically.
Clontech
Teknova
IDTdna
DNA2.0
THANK YOU FOR THE COMMUNITY SUPPORT
This project would not have been possible without the support and donations from people around the world to our Indiegogo Campaign .  The campaign had 696 funders raise $37,369.  This funding is vital, not just for the iGEM competition but as a foundation to move forward with the project.  We learned as a result of this campaign, that there is enormous support for this type of synthetic biology project among the Vegan community.
DIY COMMUNITY
The project could not have moved foreward without the support of the DIYBio Community.  Having access to lab space at BioCurious and Counter Culutre Labs is proof that coumminty science projects can be done.
TALKING ABOUT US
We are fortunate that many journalists and bloggers took an interest in our project.  Thank you to all the sites that featured Real Vegan Cheese.  Their coverage helped spread the word and was invaluable to our fundraising efforts.

Cedric Blötz
3 things my friends say about me:
well informed, humorous, and addicted to coffee.
Hey my name is Cedric.
yeah like the guy in Harry Potter. Funnily, in the laboratory I feel sometimes like a magician. I finished my B.Sc. in Göttingen at the Department of General Microbiology (AG Stülke), during my bachelor thesis, I analyzed the relation of biofilm formation of Bacillus subtilis and c-di-GMP. Now I am in the second semester of M.Sc. Microbiology and Biochemistry in Göttingen. I am interested in eukaryotic/prokaryotic regulatory processes as well as in medical biology.

Lara Schmitz
3 things my friends say about me:
open-minded, reliable, and spontaneous.
Hello everybody,
my name is Lara and like most of our team members, I am studying in the 2nd semester of the Master’s program “Microbiology and Biochemistry” in Göttingen. I already did my bachelor studies in Göttingen where I became especially interested in genetics and eukaryotic microorganisms. This is one of the reasons why I am really excited about our iGEM project. Besides, I am participating in the iGEM competition because I think it is a great opportunity to develop and realize your own research project and to gain new experiences. Apart from the university, I like to go out with friends, doing sports and have fun! So I hope that we will have a lot of fun during our project!

Hi
My name is Anika. I am currently studying Microbiology and Biochemistry in the Master program in Göttingen. That is where I also wrote my Bachelor thesis about the necessity of the citric acid cycle in Bacillus subtilis (by the way, it is not necessary ;) ). I am fascinated about the little organisms like bacteria and also pathogenic fungi. During my bachelor thesis I became more and more interested in the field of synthetic biology and that is why I joined this year’s iGEM Team.

3 things my friends say about me:
Intelligent, reliable, and authentic.
Hi there, my name is quite strange but also unique.  I come from Mexico and I kicked a ball sooner than learning to walk well, so I enjoy playing soccer. The other thing within my veins is chemistry.  Being son of chemical engineers, I decided to keep the legacy of engineering but directed to Biotechnology. Therefore, I worked with biocatalysts for the production of biofuels in my bachelor thesis and currently I am studying the second semester of my master.
Now I am on board of the iGEM Göttingen team, let’s rock!

Karthikeyan Dhamotharan
3 things my friends say about me:
committed, helping, and passionate.
Hello everyone I ’am Karthikeyan from Tamil Nadu, India…  Nature and life forms fascinates me and lead me in the field of life sciences. So, I did my graduation in Biotechnology. My work on isolating and characterizing endophytes from Banana pith and pseudo stem for my bachelor’s thesis was in finding naturally accessible means to utilize the enormous quantity of biomass wasted after the fruit harvest.  Synthetic Biology- It’s a platform to apply our knowledge to create something spectacular for better understanding of life and for the betterment of mankind. To me, iGEM as an international platform to experiment with synthetic biology, was not a choice but a chance, to experience an unforgettable journey in Science. Join me along to Boston, for a fun filled learning experience.

iGEM Team attributions page
Each team must clearly attribute work done by the student team members on this page.  The team must distinguish work done by the students from work done by others, including the host labs, advisors, instructors, and individuals not on the team roster.
Why do we have this requirement?
Attribution Template
We have this requirement to help the judges know what you did yourselves and what you had help with. We don't mind if you get help with difficult or complex techniques, just be sure to report the work your team did and the work that was done by others.
For example, you might choose to work with an animal model during your project. Working with animals requires getting a license and applying far in advance to conduct certain experiments in many countries. This is something that is difficult to achieve during the course of a summer, but much easier if you can work with a postdoc or PI who has the right licenses.
A great example of complete attribution comes from the Imperial College London 2011 team (scroll down to the bottom of their team page to see attributions).
Here are some of the fields we recommend you have on this page. If there are other areas not listed below, but applicable to your team/project, please feel free to also list them on your attributions page. Please feel free to remove any areas not applicable to your project.

Team Göttingen 2014
Once a year, an international group of ambitious and enthusiastic master students from the master programs ""Microbiology and Biochemistry"" of the Georg-August-University of Göttingen, has teamed up to join the grand iGEM meeting in Boston!
The Göttingen iGEM team from the previous year inspired us so much in their propaganda meeting. They not only presented us the essentials of the competition, gave us pointers as to what we can do differently, but most importantly, they also encouraged us to carry their legacy forward.
Our team is supported by Prof. Dr. Gerhard Braus, Dr. rer. nat. Christoph Sasse (both from the Dept. of Molecular Microbiology and Genetics) and PD Dr. Joachim Uhrig (Department of Plant molecular Biology and Physiology). They not only give advises on the research of our topic, but also support us in how to organise the human project and raise funds.
Let's start a fascinating trip towards the final Giant Jamboree in Boston!
Meet our team and take a journey with us in the university !

Who We Are
We are the CityU iGEM team. Everyone here lives and breathes our passion! Our goal is to create something that change the world.
Maria Li
Biologist & Wiki Designer
bio
Ciao a tutti! I’m Maria. I love to explore innovative stuff and to apply science concepts to improve human lives. This is the first time I get in touch with synthetic biology and I find it a very fascinating field to explore. In the iGEM project, I help my team to build the wiki and construct a gene cluster of fadD and fadL. I am also the presenter in our team. My life isn’t all about science, I’m passionate about music (blues, rock, rap…), website design, water sports (surfing!!!) and travel.
Marco So
Biologist & presenter
bio
I am a year 3 student majoring in Applied Biology. Participating in this competition realizes my dream of putting knowledge acquired in lessons into practical uses.I think my strengths include giving ideas, presenting in front of a crowd and keeping my team happy. I love my teammates. CityU iGEM 2014 would not be possible without any of them. Lastly, in my philosophy, the world is beautiful, and the people are gorgeous. Why not live with and enjoy both the good and bad?
Dorcas Choi
Biologist & presenter
bio
I am Cas. This is our first year to participate in the iGEM competition. It was difficult at first yet fruitful in the end. iGEM competition not only broadened our biological knowledge, but also stimulated our innovative skills and creativity. Most importantly, it gathered 12 of us as one team that shared one goal – to explore, to learn and to improve. I believe this goal is not only limited to one team or one competition, but also serves as a life-long motto.
Paul Tse
Biologist
bio
Aloha everybody. My name is Paul and I am a sophomore majoring in Biology and minoring in Psychology. I am enthusiastic about singing and the philosophy behind Christianity. In addition, I like reading comics and watching animation to kill time. This is actually the first time I participate in a scientific research project. I am mainly responsible for the lab work to construct a gene cluster of desaturases in this iGEM project. Hopefully this short journey will shed light on how my life will be in the future.
Cherlin Lee
Biologist & Poster Design
bio
Hi, I am Cherlin, a year 3 student majoring in Applied Biology. When I was small, I dreamt to have a microscope in my home, because my parents told me that our surrounding was full of bacteria, but I wondered if that was true. If I got a microscope, I could prove whether my parents were telling the truth. That little Cherlin could never imagine that one day when she grows up, she can even genetically modify bacteria!!! That is a wonderful journey of scientific discovery!!!
Ken Lau
Bioengineer & wiki builder
bio
Hi, I am Ken and a year three student in Mechatronics. iGEM gives me a rare chance to learn about synthetic biology and how to conduct biological research. In contrast to an engineering project, calculation is not the most essential element in biology. The result could be completely different if we repeat the same experiment. No matter how many painstaking yet joyful hours I have spent with agarose gel or culture plates, I am still spellbound by the unpredictability of the laboratory. And of course, I had so much fun doing lab with my lovely team members.
Lyann Chu
Bioengineer
bio
I am a Bioengineering student. I am interested in developing new technology and tools for the sake of bio-research. iGEM gives me an opportunity to apply what I have learnt in these two years to solve current problems. Being an iGEMer, I am responsible for doing lab works. Although our journey has not been smooth, there is nothing we cannot overcome with teamwork and team spirit. Through this student-oriented competition, I learnt not only different scientific techniques but also management skills to enhance working efficiency. I am privileged to be a part of this competition which provides an opportunity for engineering students to experience the laboratory.
Joanna Wu
Biologist
bio
Hello, everyone! I am Joanna, the only non-local member in our team. I come from Taiwan and this is my 3rd year at CityU. I major in Applied Biology. I love everything  related to biology, especially animals. I consider myself an optimistic and hard-working girl. The reason why I join iGEM is that I want to learn more about synthetic biology and to be familiar with laboratory work. Apart from that, I hope to gain precious memories and friendship through participating in the iGEM competition. My dream is to be an expert naturalist in animal behavior or a vet in the future.
Ada Yeung
Bioengineer & Human Practice presenter
bio
Hi, everyone. I am Ada Yeung, a year three Bioengineering student. Frankly speaking, iGEM has been one of the greatest events in my life. It is my first time to go overseas for an international competition and to have such a long-term cooperation with teammates. As a Bioengineering student, I wish to integrate my engineering concepts, like characterization, into our project. In terms of my own philosophy, I stress on true freedom without limitation (given that it is moral). I do think the so-called unrealistic ideas are the source of imagination and may be the start of a brand new future. Had no one ever thought of flying in the sky, there would be no airplane for us to travel around the world today. Scientific research, including our iGEM project, should also be perceived this way in my opinion.
Ronald Tse
Biologist & Poster Design
bio
I am Ronald. I am majored in Applied Biology. I was first attracted by this competition when I knew that I will have the chance to design and construct a bacteria with certain functions. It's incredible. I think it's a valuable chance in my life and I don't think I will have such a chance in the future. That's why I am here! To me, being different is important. I don't think there is only one way for me to reach my goal. I will try something different and I won't give up until I have tried hard on it.
Paul Chi
Biologist & Poster Design
bio
Hello! I am Paul. I am an undergraduate majoring in applied biology. I like science especially biology and chemistry. Why? Because I think doing experiments is fun, no matter what the result is, or whether it is successful or not. The process is exciting because I can still repeat them in hundreds or even thousands of different conditions and wait for its success when I have the time. I joined iGEM so I can have more lab work to do and it is fun to work in the lab.
Anthony Lo
Biologist
bio
I am Anthony Lo. I am especially interested in microbiology and molecular biology. Participating in the iGEM competition lets me apply what I have learnt, explore more about molecular biology and related practical skills, as well as create a genetically engineered bacteria by designing a gene constructed for cloning and measuring. To me, “work hard, play hard” is always true, implying the importance of work-life balance. I am concentrated in our experiments and am serious in the lab, but I would not hesitate to spend the time on entertainment with my teammates. “Work hard” leads to efficiency, while “play hard” leads to relief and stronger friendship!

Wolf Cheung
Former Graduate Teaching Assistant
He has very broad research interest and occasionally jumps from one research area to an entirely unrelated one. His most recent switch is from environmental science to developmental biology. He spends most of his time in the lab(s) enjoying varieties of tea. He remains wathcing over the CityU iGEM team’s shoulder, in spite of his departure to a faraway land.
Wolf Cheung
Terry Leung
(BSc Hons)
I am currently a Graduate Teaching Assistant in the Dept of Biology and Chemistry at the City University of Hong Kong. This is the first time for CityU to participate in iGEM. iGEM participants can enrich their learning and discovery experience outside the classroom and appreciate how interesting and diverse science can be. Apart from providing technical support to the CityU iGEM team members, I have taken a special interest on the effectiveness of their learning progress. Whenever they encountered technical difficulties, I would help our with the technical details. Although synthetic biology is a new and challenging area of science, it is a worthwhile experience to explore the fascinating field of synthetic biology.
Terry Leung
Oscar
I am a fresh graduate from City University of Hong Kong Applied Biology program. Currently as a research assistant in Dr Richard Kong’s lab. My duty is to ensure the iGEMers can get all the necessities for their experiments and to give technical support when they encounter difficulty. It is awesome to work with all the iGEMers and I really enjoy every minute with the team. I hope my limited experience in biology research can help the team and make things a little bit easier.
Oscar
So Pui Yu
I am a fresh graduate and currently a Research Assistant from Department of Biology and Chemistry at the City University of Hong Kong. I have longed to participate iGEM for years. Though I could not take part in this amazing project as a student, instead, I cannot imagine that I could guide iGEM participants by providing technical supports. I hope all CityU iGEM Team members would take pride in the synthetic biology and gain the most in such a great event.
So Pui Yu
SHEK Wing Chi
(BSc Hons)
As one of the teaching assistants at City University of Hong Kong, it is my great pleasure to provide technical support to the CityU iGEM team in providing assistance with quantitative real-time PCR analyses. We have encountered various problems as we do not have prior experience in the iGEM competition. I am grateful that I can use my knowledge and research experience to serve the CityU team members. Learning outside the classroom and developing the interest in science are much more important than anything else that our team members can obtain through iGEM. Although preparing for the iGEM is a challenging experience, it is truly worthwhile to support students in pursuing their interest and research experience in Synthetic Biology.

Attributions
iGEM Team attributions page
Each team must clearly attribute work done by the student team members on this page.  The team must distinguish work done by the students from work done by others, including the host labs, advisors, instructors, and individuals not on the team roster.
Why do we have this requirement?
Attribution Template
We have this requirement to help the judges know what you did yourselves and what you had help with. We don't mind if you get help with difficult or complex techniques, just be sure to report the work your team did and the work that was done by others.
For example, you might choose to work with an animal model during your project. Working with animals requires getting a license and applying far in advance to conduct certain experiments in many countries. This is something that is difficult to achieve during the course of a summer, but much easier if you can work with a postdoc or PI who has the right licenses.
A great example of complete attribution comes from the Imperial College London 2011 team (scroll down to the bottom of their team page to see attributions).
Here are some of the fields we recommend you have on this page. If there are other areas not listed below, but applicable to your team/project, please feel free to also list them on your attributions page. Please feel free to remove any areas not applicable to your project.
General Support
Project support and advice
Fundraising help and advice
Lab support
Difficult technique support
Project advisor support
Wiki support
Presentation coaching
Policy & Practices support
Thanks and acknowledgements for all other people involved in helping make a successful iGEM team.

iGEM Team attributions page
Each team must clearly attribute work done by the student team members on this page.  The team must distinguish work done by the students from work done by others, including the host labs, advisors, instructors, and individuals not on the team roster.
Why do we have this requirement?
Attribution Template
We have this requirement to help the judges know what you did yourselves and what you had help with. We don't mind if you get help with difficult or complex techniques, just be sure to report the work your team did and the work that was done by others.
For example, you might choose to work with an animal model during your project. Working with animals requires getting a license and applying far in advance to conduct certain experiments in many countries. This is something that is difficult to achieve during the course of a summer, but much easier if you can work with a postdoc or PI who has the right licenses.
A great example of complete attribution comes from the Imperial College London 2011 team (scroll down to the bottom of their team page to see attributions).
Here are some of the fields we recommend you have on this page. If there are other areas not listed below, but applicable to your team/project, please feel free to also list them on your attributions page. Please feel free to remove any areas not applicable to your project.

i4 Chair
For this project we were positioned under the scheme of this chair to administrate our funding and role in the school. The students chair (i4) is a opportunity offered by the Tecnológico de Monterrey in Monterrey, through its School of Biotechnology and Health Sciences, to students interested in biotechnology and food industries develop projects in the area. The concept is based on four core values:
Imagine.
Investigate.
Innovate.
Incubate.
Student teams, like ours, that want to apply your project may reach hatching their own business, running an article in scientific research, process your patent application and compete internationally. We are specally grateful with them for their generous sponsorship, that allowed us to get the genes and some material for the project.
School of Biotechnology and Health Sciences (ESCB: Escuela de Biotecnología y Ciencias de la Salud)
The School of Biotechnology and Health Sciences integrates talent, infrastructure and curriculum design to provide the best educational, research and knowledge transfer in Mexico and Latin America. Our school combines science and technology to create value and quality of life in society, and sustainable processes and performed with the highest degree of social responsibility. Thus, our motto ""Integrating Science, Technology and Business"" describes the vision of outcomes generated in every academic program.
FEMSA Biotechnology Center
The FEMSA Biotechnology Center in the Tecnológico de Monterrey integrates researchers from several academic departments to create interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary groups. Also, it's dedicated to generate research, knowledge transfer and business design models in food and biotechnology areas. It emerged 15 years ago as a response to the growing trend in scientific and technological innovation in the country and the whole world. Through time, the Biotechnology Center has developed lines of biotechnology research directed toward the innovation of processes, products, and services.
Tecnológico de Monterrey
Our institution Tecnológico de Monterrey located in Monterrey, Nuevo León, which was founded on 1943 by Eugenio Garza Sada and a group of businessmen formed a civil- and nonprofit partnership, named Higher Education and Research, A.C.
Based in Monterrey, Mexico, the Institute has 31 campuses in 25 cities throughout the countryand is known for becoming the first university ever connected to the Internet in Latin America, having one of the top graduate business schools in the region and being one of the leaders in patent applications among Mexican universities.
Today, the Tecnológico de Monterrey is a multicampus system with five common core values: innovation, global vision, team work, humanistic outlook and integrity.

Attributions
iGEM Team attributions page
Each team must clearly attribute work done by the student team members on this page.  The team must distinguish work done by the students from work done by others, including the host labs, advisors, instructors, and individuals not on the team roster.
Why do we have this requirement?
Attribution Template
We have this requirement to help the judges know what you did yourselves and what you had help with. We don't mind if you get help with difficult or complex techniques, just be sure to report the work your team did and the work that was done by others.
For example, you might choose to work with an animal model during your project. Working with animals requires getting a license and applying far in advance to conduct certain experiments in many countries. This is something that is difficult to achieve during the course of a summer, but much easier if you can work with a postdoc or PI who has the right licenses.
A great example of complete attribution comes from the Imperial College London 2011 team (scroll down to the bottom of their team page to see attributions).
Here are some of the fields we recommend you have on this page. If there are other areas not listed below, but applicable to your team/project, please feel free to also list them on your attributions page. Please feel free to remove any areas not applicable to your project.
General Support
Project support and advice
Fundraising help and advice
Lab support
Difficult technique support
Project advisor support
Wiki support
Presentation coaching
Policy & Practices support
Thanks and acknowledgements for all other people involved in helping make a successful iGEM team.

Here we express our gratitude to the great support from the three advisors for their selflessly and nobly aids when students were caught in plight during experiment or were ignorant about the usage of some apparatus. In addition, thanks to their connection and communication with many professors can we successfully borrow some apparatus which is not open for undergraduate usually. Finally, we say ""thanks"" again for the room they left us to carry out many experiments.

iGEM Team attributions page
Each team must clearly attribute work done by the student team members on this page.  The team must distinguish work done by the students from work done by others, including the host labs, advisors, instructors, and individuals not on the team roster.
Why do we have this requirement?
Attribution Template
We have this requirement to help the judges know what you did yourselves and what you had help with. We don't mind if you get help with difficult or complex techniques, just be sure to report the work your team did and the work that was done by others.
For example, you might choose to work with an animal model during your project. Working with animals requires getting a license and applying far in advance to conduct certain experiments in many countries. This is something that is difficult to achieve during the course of a summer, but much easier if you can work with a postdoc or PI who has the right licenses.
A great example of complete attribution comes from the Imperial College London 2011 team (scroll down to the bottom of their team page to see attributions).
Here are some of the fields we recommend you have on this page. If there are other areas not listed below, but applicable to your team/project, please feel free to also list them on your attributions page. Please feel free to remove any areas not applicable to your project.

@iGEM_Paris
We are the 2014 iGEM Paris Bettencourt team, a part of the Centre Recherches Interdisciplinaires (CRI) in Paris. Our smelly team is composed of people from all around the globe with a variety of backgrounds from Biology to Design to Engineering and Informatics. Our common interest in the human microbiome and odors has led us to our project that we proudly present to you: 'The Smell of Us'.
CLOVIS BASIERBiologistI did iGEM last year with the team Paris Bettencourt and the experience was great. I learnt more than I ever had and met fantastic people. I signed up again this year as an advisor to share my experience and work on a new creative project as well as meet new people and eat ice creams!
MARGUERITE BENONYDesignerI am a 23 years old product designer and a member of 2013 Paris Bettencourt iGEM team. While I was studying applied arts, I became deeply interested in Biology and harnessed my designer's energy to seek the potential of an exciting upcoming field witch is the synergy between design and biology.Whilst investigating this friction, I discovered Synthetic Biology. I became instantly amazed by its potential in real life implication and the role that design could have in this technology. Naturally, I then wanted to acquire actual wet lab experience in Synthetic Biology, enabling me to explore how designers can work with scientists and what are their roles, missions, interest would be. I believe iGEM is the best place for this investigation!
ARIEL LINDNERSystems BiologistI'm a researcher director at the Systems Evolutions and Engineering Dynamics (SEED) group at the French national Biomedical research Institute (INSERM) and co-founder of the Centre for Research and Interdisciplinarity (CRI). Since 2006 I've been mentoring the first French team to participate in the iGEM adventure and still enjoy being challenged by team's students and see their projects flower.
IAN MARCUSMicrobial EcologistI'm a postdoc at the CRI, studying learning in synthetic biology through SynBio4all, an online open science platform. My PhD dissertation focused on the relationship between microbial community structure and function under varying environmental conditions and stresses. This is my first iGEM experience, and I'm having a blast as an advisor for this amazing group of extremely talented students!
ZORAN MARINKOVICSystems BiologistI am a first year PhD student from the Frontières du Vivant PhD school. I studied Molecular and Evolutionary Biology at University of Zagreb in Croatia and Uppsala University in Sweden. I obtained my master's degree in Systems and Synthetic Biology at Paris Descartes University. In 2012 I was a student member of the iGEM Paris Bettencourt team and in 2013 I was an advisor. My primary scientific interest is application of synthetic biology for creating bioproducts as well as using synthetic biology in fundamental research. I am also quite interested in developing synthetic biology as a tool for creating living organisms from scratch as we build many non-living constructs today.
JAKE WINTERMUTESystems BiologistI’m a postdoc at the CRI and I teach the Synthetic Biology course for first-year master’s students. I did my Ph.D. in Pam Silver’s lab in the Harvard Systems Biology department. My research interests include aging, evolution, metabolism and of course Synthetic Biology.
HENRY DE BELLYBiophysicistI am 22, I have a Bachelor in Microbiology and Immunology. I am currently completing a master degree in life science at the Centre de Recherches Interdisciplinaires. I am very interested in system biology, biophysics, quantitative biology and single cell study approaches. Moreover I am also interested on how an interdisciplinary team can work together to resolve complex problems. I am very excited about iGEM, it’s a great opportunity to meet new people’s with a lot of talent and ideas. I am apparently a mutant for the Trimethylamine receptor, which is cool because apparently the lab is smelling a lot !
JUDITH BOLDTBioinformaticianI come from Hamburg, a city known for its rainy and windy weather. After studying Mathematics and Bioinformatics in the sunny Munich, I almost feel at home in Paris, where you never know if it will rain in the next minute. Before I joined iGEM, I spent 6 months studying at the CRI, getting to know a new and interactive way of learning. With iGEM, I want to put my theoretical knowledge into use in a scientific project.
IHAB BOULASBiologist After graduating with a Biomedical Sciences BSc., my interests were focused on bringing new answers to neurodegeneration and aging by the use of innovative approaches such as Synthetic Biology. In that respect I wanted to learn by doing Synthetic Biology. Besides, I see this project as a large proof of concept : showing that we are able to control our microbiome. I am a project driven scientist. Being involved in a motivating project allows me to have full commitment to it and to live by it. Thus, I see this competition as an opportunity not only to commit to a project I helped design but also to broaden my skills and show what I can accomplish in a given period of time. It looks like it's gonna be a summer as great as smelly !
MARIANNE CARDONDesignerI am a 24 years old student at ENSCI - Les Ateliers Design school. iGEM gives me the opportunity to work on a science base project with an international and interdisciplinary team. I think design can help to reach user centered project and question the relation between innovation and society, as much as facilitate the public access to scientific research and ideas. Taking part in this project is the best way to put theory into practice !
URSZULA CZERWINSKASystems BiologistMy name is Ula and I am from Poland. I study Systems Biology in Paris. Besides science I am very interested in Science communication and education. At iGEM I am working on the 'Teen Spirit'. I try to evolve bacteria to scavenge 2-nonenal, a molecule responsible for the old people specific odor. I love iGEM spirit and my iGEM international team. Cannot wait to participate in the Jaboree.
ALEXANDRE EVANSBiotechnologist Hey there.I study Biotechnologies for a year now and I love learning new stuff.This summer i've been mainly working on our citizen science project and gathered tons of sweat around Paris ! I also enjoy looking at people's face after smelling a sample, this is priceless ! After smelling billions of samples for iGEM (i never joke), I am now immune to strong and bad body odors, though i still cannot stand the odor from my neighbour cooking fish every single day, but that's a different story.Nevermind, BODY ODOR FROM ALL AROUND THE WORLD, I CHALLENGE YOU, COME AT ME BRAS.
JUAN MANUEL GARCIABiotechnologistHiya! This is Juanma (Juan Manuel), a Spanish flamenco-dancer scientist from Sevilla. I love good food, travelling, learning languages and meeting new people. I am in between education and bioengineering, between politics and genetics. This year, I am doing some bacterial genetics at iGEM but my main focus in on the MOOC supporting iGEM High School competition, and I enjoy it!
CRISTINA GARCÍA-TÍMERMANSMedical BiochemistI am a master student in 'Approaches Interdisciplinaires du Vivant' and alumni of the University of Navarra. As a Biochemist, I want to find out how to use SynBio to change the Human Microbiome. As a citizen, I hope our evil plan works so that the parisian metro will not stink anymore. Au revoir body odor! I imagine a world that smells like baked bread, jasmine and rain.
AAKRITI JAINBio-engineerI am a bioengineer/bioinformatician for this year's Paris Bettencourt iGEM team and a recent graduate from UC Berkeley and an M2 student at the CRI. Upon my arrival to Paris, I took the metro from the airport to my new apartment, and immediately realized the reason behind the energy and enthusiasm the team had to cure body odor. My hope is that the Paris metro will one day smell of jasmine and wintergreen. I dream of the day when people on my team will stop asking me to smell samples of armpit odor, fish odor, foot odor, and a milieu of other extremely disgusting odors.
MEGANE MATYSIAKBio-engineerI am a student in biotechnology engineering. My interests involve fields such as optogenetics, bioelectric controlled prosthesis, and biotechnologies in general. Since biotechnologies involve more and more synthetic biology, iGEM seemed like the perfect opportunity for me to learn by doing. Moreover, I wanted to apply my skills in bioinformatics and engineering to a common issue: the human-microbiome relationship. Therefore it is reasonable to think that my expectations for this summer will be smelly fulfilled!
ESTEFANIA MUCINO CASTILLOBiologistMy name is Estefanía. I am Mexican. I coursed my Bachelor studies at the Philipps-University Marburg in Germany. I am now in the second year of my Master studies at the Université Pierre et Marie Curie in Paris France.  Innovation and networking fascinate me as much as science. Entrepeneurship is a field in which I would like to act in the future. My passion is to meet new cultures.
NARESH RAMBABUNeuroscientistThis is Naresh Rambabu from India, I am a biotechnologist, currently i am pursuing my masters in Bioinnovation and Engineering in Neuroscience.  I love iGEM. I am kind of a cool and complicated guy. I show more interest towards the new technologies, no matter which domain it falls under. I often do crazy things out of curiosity and I call it science.
FRANCOIS ROUSSETBiologistI am 20 and passionated by science and music. I am currently a 2nd year student in AgroParisTech, the French institute for life, food and environment. I discovered Synthetic Biology at the beginning of the year and I found that iGEM was an unique opportunity to get a first experience in the world of research. This summer I worked on great subprojects: Teen spirit and Something Fishy, causing delicious odors in the lab during the whole summer! But it's for science so whatever!
PIERRE-LUC SATINBiologistI am a biologist in third year in the Licence Frontière du Vivant. I am interest in genetics in general and stem cell in particular.I am also interrest a bit in informatics, that's why I became the wiki guy of the team. I think this project is a good idea which as a future in cometics but I have a very sensitive nose and the smell in the lab was very hard to support sometimes but if we can help curing stinky people I can suffer a bit to make the world smell better.
ANTONIO VILLAREAL LARRAURIBiologistI am a biotech engineer enrolled in the AIV masters at the Centre de Recherche Interdisciplinaires. My scientific interests include molecular evolution, metabolic engineering, as well as synthetic and systems biology. I tend to get philosophical about a wide range of subjects quite often. I love the ocean and I still believe music will change the world.
SYLVIA YANGBiological Engineer and EntrepreneurHi, I am Sylvia Yang. I grew up in Shenzhen, China, right beside Hong Kong, and am a junior in Stanford University majoring in Bioengineering, interested in Political Science, studio art and business.  Out of lab and school, I love traveling, scuba diving and talking to synthetic biologists. I hate rats and PCRs that never work. iGEM has been a great experience and I look forward to meeting you in Boston!

Host Lab
We were hosted at the CRI (Centre for Research and Interdisciplinarity) located in the University Paris Descartes. The host lab provided us all the machines necessary for microbiology and molecular biology such as centrifuges, PCR machines, sterile hoods, freezers, incubators, microscopes, plate readers, glassware, a NanoDrop machine, etc. We were in charge of taking care of the stocks as well as ordering lab consumables such as gloves, plates, pipettes, tips, and tubes as well as chemicals and DNA. All the media preparation and the glassware washing was done by us.
Chemistry department - University Paris Diderot
We  analyzed volatile compounds with a gas chromatograph-mass spectrometer device in the chemistry laboratory of Paris-Diderot University. Marie-Evelyne PINART and David CLAINQUART contributed to the results of the projects by allowing us to lead our experiments in their lab.

The goal is to select a bacteria able to develop on 2-nonenal. We made 3 media:
1) M9 Minimal Media 100% Glucose
200mL M9 Salts
0.1mL CaCl2 1M
2mL MgSO4 1M
20mL Glucose 20%
Water: bring to 1L
2) M9 Minimal Media 50% Glucose - 50% 2-Nonenal (according to the number of carbon atoms)
200mL M9 Salts
0.1mL CaCl2 1M
2mL MgSO4 1M
10mL Glucose 20%
10mL 2-nonenal 10,7%*
Water: bring to 1L
3) M9 Minimal Media 100% 2-nonenal
200mL M9 Salts
0.1mL CaCl2 1M
2mL MgSO4 1M
20mL 2-nonenal 10,7%*
Water: bring to 1L
We autoclaved 6 bottles (2 of 500mL for each)
Then, we made liquid culture of C.striatum in media 1) to try if the minima media works.
* Concentration of the 2-nonenal solution: In M9 Media, we use 20mL of Glucose 20% (200g/L). The concentration of glucose is C=200/M=1.09 mol/L. Glucose has 6 carbons while 2-nonenal has 9, so we need 2/3 of the glucose volume to have the same amount of carbon atoms. C=2/3*1.09=0.74 mol/L and then 0.74*M=103.7g/L. That's why the concentration of the 2-nonenal solution is 10.73%. We also added Tween80.
August 6th
We poured 20 plates of each of the 3 media with 350mL of an agar solution and 100mL of medium.
Then we used 3 plates of each type to culture skin bacteria from 3 spots: arm, armpit and forehead. Ursczula sampled bacteria from her skin with a loop and for each spot she diluted the bacteria in 300uL of NF Water. Then we plated 100uL of each solution in each of the 3 types of plates and incubated them at 37°C.

After 2 days, nothind has developped on the M9 plates. M9 media is actually really slow for the development of any strain. That is why we created a new media which would be like the real skin environment: synthetic sweat according to this recipe
According to the recipe, fatty acids seem to be the main source of carbon in synthetic sweat so we replaced them by 2-nonenal. We made 2 media: 1) without fatty acids 2) without fatty acids and with 2-nonenal mixed with 10% of Tween 80.

Analysis: The fitness of bacteria is better on 100% Glucose than on 50-50%. No colony develops on 2-nonenal, not even NEB. Then we can suggest that 2-nonenal is not used as a carbon source and that the difference of fitness between 100% glucose and 50-50% is only due to the lower amount of glucose in 50-50%. We should have made plates with only 50% of glucose to compare.
We also plated samples on synthetic sweat:

On August 10th, Jake tried a new medium with peptone added to M9. He made 2 media (20 plates of each):
iGEM medium 1 (100% glucose)
pancreatic digest of casein: 15 g
glucose: 5 g
NaCl: l5 g
Agar: 15 g
Water: 1 L
iGEM medium 2 (100% 2-nonenal):
pancreatic digest of casein: 15 g
2-nonenal: 10 g
Tween 80: 250uL (premix with 2-nonenal before adding to the medium)
NaCl: l5 g
Agar: 15 g
Water: 1 L
I prepared 2 new media:
iGEM medium 3 (50% glucose)
pancreatic digest of casein: 7.5 g
glucose: 1.25 g
NaCl: 7.5 g
Agar: 7.5 g
Water: 0.5 L
iGEM medium 4 (50% glucose - 50% 2-nonenal):
pancreatic digest of casein: 7.5 g
glucose: 1.25 g
2-nonenal: 2.5 g
Tween 80: 125uL (premix with 2-nonenal before adding to the autoclaved medium)
NaCl: 7.5 g
Agar: 7.5 g
Water: 0.5 L
I autoclaved them at 111°C - 30min (programm 5).
Then, I added the 2-nonenal to iGEM medium 4: density of nonenal is 0.846g/mL so I put 2.5/0.846 = 2.96 mL of 2-nonenal mixed with 125uL of Tween 80. I poured 20 plates of each medium and then plated before incubating at 37°C:

I plated on LBA the colony developped on 100% 2-nonenal from the Urszula's forehead to developp it.
August 14th
The colony developped on M9 100% 2-nonenal developped perfectly on LBA plates. It seems to be Staphylococcus aureus. I transfered colonies on 3 M9 100% 2-nonenal plates and I started 2 liquid cultures: one in LB and one in M9 100% 2-nonenal.
August 17th
We started new approach: Directed evolution of forehead, armpit and nose skin samples  in the liquid medium First two forehead samples  in 37°C in medium 95% (4.75mL) LB and 5% M9 Minimal Media 100% 2-nonenal (0.25 mL)
August 18th
1) After four days of culture, I measured the absorbance of the liquid cultures of Staphylococcus aureus in LB and in M9 100% 2-nonenal medium.
A
LB

M9 100% 2-nonenal medium

S.aureus still develops on 2-nonenal but its fitness is much lower than on LB. I let it grow a few days more.
2) M9 plates from August 6th
It seems like we got small colonies on every 100% 2-nonenal plate (NEB, Forehead, Arm and Armpit). For each one, I prepared 2 liquid cultures: 1 LB and 1 M9 100% 2-nonenal.
3)Directed evolution
Absorbance has been measured for 2 tubes. A = 0 in both tubes. I will give it one more day
For an armpit and nose skin samples I proceeded similarly as started yesterday: incubated in 37°C in medium 95% (4.75mL) LB and 5% M9 Minimal Media 100% 2-nonenal (0.25 mL) with a sample from my armpit and another sample from my nose skin.

I plated on LBA the forehead colonies from August 15th which had developped on 2-nonenal. Next week we will make a olfactive test to estimate the decrease of 2-nonenal using S.aureus. This strain will be called (N+)-S.aureus.

2) Plates (Samples 1 and 2)
The LB plate of (N+)-S.aureus has many colonies. I made a liquid culture to get a glycerol stock.
3) New M9
I prepared 2x50mL of each media:
M9 - 2-nonenal (120uL mixed for 3uL of Tween80 added after autoclave for 50mL of medium)
M9 - 2-nonenal (120uL mixed for 3uL of Tween80 added after autoclave for 50mL of medium) + 0.5g of peptone for 50mL of medium
I want to try to make M9 a faster medium. I started a liquid culture of (N+)-S.aureus and measured the initial density of each medium.
OD600
M9 - 2-nonenal
0.885
M9 - 2-nonenal + peptone
0.994
August 21th
1) Glycerol stock
I made a glycerol stock using (N+)-S.aureus liquid culture in LB according to this protocol . The strain is now called sPB.050
2) M9 overnight liquid cultures
After 24 hours, I measured the OD600 of the M9 liquid cultures with or without 2-nonenal.
OD600 before culture
OD600 after 24H culture
M9 - 2-nonenal
0.885
0.424
M9 - 2-nonenal + peptone
0.994
0.511
The result can be surprising because OD600 has decreased. But we figured out thant the main element which sets OD600 is the concentration of 2-nonenal because our medium is an emulsion. That is why OD600 is really variable according to the mixture. There is here a balance between the bacterian growth which increases OD600, correlated to a decrease of 2-nonenal concentration which lowers OD600 because it is consumed by the cells. It would be interesting to plot OD600 as a function of 2-nonenal concentration and CFU.
To plot OD600 as a function of CFU, I used the (N+)-S.aureus liquid culture in LB, putting different volumes in each tube. Then I centrifuged the tubes (1min-5000tr/min), discarded the supernatant, added 1mL of PBS and resuspended the cell by vortexing. I measured OD600 (with 500uL of solution) and then plated the solutions (100uL in each plate).

To plot OD600 as a function of 2-nonenal concentration, I mixed 1mL of 2-nonenal with 5% of Tween80 (50uL). Then I prepared these solutions with a total volume of 1mL, and I measured their OD600 after 30min:

We started to have doubts about accuracy of the OD600 measurments because just by adding moe 2-nonenal to the media, we increase the density. However, with the measurments we did (2-nonenal + TWIN concentration vs. OD) we hope to estimate the cell content correctly.
We modified the protocol. We measure OD600. We take 10um from of the overnight colony and we put it into the new medium with 5% more 2-nonenal and 5% less LB. This will allow us to see better growth of bacteria.

1) Olfactive test experiment
This week we are leading our olfactive test experiment using sPB.050 and M9-2-nonenal medium. Each day of the week we start a liquid culture of sPB.050 in M9-2-nonenal: on Friday we will have 5 cultures, each one 0, 1, 2, 3 or 4 days old. We will plate each of this culture on LB to determine the CFU and have all the tubes smelled and rated by the team according to the intensity with a blind test.
2)Plating the team's forehead samples
I plated on LB and on M9-2-nonenal Alexandre's, Sylvia's, Cristina's, Naresh's, Henry's and my forehead samples in order to find other bacteria developping on 2-nonenal.

Then I took 10um from each sample and I put it into the medium 50%LB : 50% M9nonenal and put it into incubator 37C for overnight.
2) I got a suggestion from other member of the team that bacteria from the body samples growing on the LB plates in the experiment they  may differ depending on the way I put them on the plate. So far, we have been taking samples by scratching body surface with a loop. This time we took a cotton pad and inoculated it in LB in 37C overnight in order to plate them on 2-nonenal plates next day
3) Gram colouration. I performed the gram colouration in order identify the pSB.050. According to the observation the bacteria are gram negative (fuchsia colour).

The negative numbers may be surprising but taking into account that 2-nonenal with time get degraded (hopefully but bacteria in culture or by oxidation).

  Smell Like Teen Spirit
BACKGROUND
2-nonenal is what ""old people smell"" is: an odor compound unique to the sweat of old individuals. The smell of 2-nonenal is described as a combination of cucumber, orris and fat. Most of the 2-nonenal on the skin surface comes from the breakdown of sweat-secreted omega-7 fatty acids.
AIMS
The goal of this project is to isolate bacterial strains that are able to digest, scavenge and eliminate 2-nonenal from the skin. These strains could be packaged into a bacterial cosmetic that attenuates old people smell.
ACHIEVEMENTS
Isolated 4 bacterial species capable of growing on 2-nonenal as a carbon source.
Determined the critical smell detection limit of 2-nonenal.
Analyzed 2-nonenal tolerance and degradation in natural isolates.
Introduction
Motivation
Aims
Results
Figure 1.  Isolation of 2-nonenal metabolizing strains. Samples were taken from 3 different body sites with an inoculating loop and struck on M9 2-nonenal plates. After 1 week of incubation at 37C, we identified 3 growing colonies: Micrococcus luteus, Curtobacterium flaccumfaciens and Escherichia fergusonii.
Figure 2. 2-nonenal accumulates in elder skin. 2-nonenal is believed to come from the oxidation of palmitoleic acid accelerated by lipid peroxides ( Haze et al., 2001 )
Figure 3. A word cloud of odor descriptors for 2-nonenal. Words were freely assigned by 17 smellers to 2-nonenal at a concentration of 100 ppm.
Introduction
Body odor is affected by age. The existence of a characteristic ""old person smell"" has been long discussed anecdotally and recently confirmed experimentally. Even untrained smellers can classify age by scent alone ( Mitro et al., 2012 ) The presence of 2-nonenal in body odor is correlated with age and detectable only in people over 40 years old ( Haze et al., 2001 ).
2-nonenal is an unsaturated aldehyde smelling of orris, cucumber and fat ( Flavornet database, ). It is detectable to the human nose at concentrations as low as 3 ppm. The exact source of 2-nonenal in sweat is currently not known, but it is believed to derive from skin-secreted lipids, oxidized by bacterial lipid peroxidases ( Mitro et al., 2012 ).
The appearance of 2-nonenal in sweat with age has no negative health consequences. The perception of 2-nonenal is subjective, and may be pleasant or unpleasant depending on the smeller and the context. However, ""old person smell"" can carry a social stigma and some people may prefer to remove it from their body odor for cosmetic reasons. Also, 2-nonenal can be a case study in targeted microbiome modulation. If we can selectively remove this molecule, we may learn to alter other properties of the complex skin surface.
Figure 4. Diffusion model of 2-nonenal through air. This animation shows the concentration of 2-nonenal diffusing through air to equilibrium. 2-nonenal rapidly diffuses to reach the detection threshold of the human nose, even at low skin surface concentrations (2.6 +/- 3.5 ppm).
Figure 5. M. luteus grows on M9-nonenal media. Colonies of M. luteus were struck out and grown for 5 days at 37C. E. coli, the control strain, grows on LB media but not M9-nonenal.
Box 1. Selected information about strains isolated on 2-nonenal.
Figure 6. Humans can detect 2-nonenal at 100 ppm. 12 human smellers were asked to identify pure 2-nonenal in water at the following fold dilutions: 102 104 106 and 108. All samples were solubilized with tween 80 at a concentration of 0.05%. All smell tests were double-blind. Samples are scored by the percentage of smellers who were able to positively distinguish them from tween-only controls.
Figure 7. Smell test results. 15 people smelled the samples of M.luteus  or C. flaccumfaciens grown in LB with 625ppm 2-nonenal, or a control sample witn 2-nonenal but no bacteria. The 2-nonenal smell was the least intense in the culture containing M.luteus (p-value: 1.04e-09, HSD turkey test). C. flaccumfaciens was also decreased 2-nonenal smell (p-value: 9.72e-05 HSD turkey test). Error bars represent 95% confidence intervals.
Results
Diffusion Model of 2-nonenal through air
A simple model was created for the diffusion of 2-nonenal into the air using COMSOL Multiphysics (a physics-based interface to solve partial differential equations). The model is shown in Fig.4. From literature, it was found that the odor threshold of 2-nonenal in air is approximately 10-4 mg/kg air ( Grosch, 2009 ). This odor threshold was reached approximately 7 hours in the model, at a distance of 5 cm from the skin surface.
Isolation of strains on 2-nonenal We sought to isolate bacterial strains adapted to use 2-nonenal as a carbon source. Such strains could hypothetically be used to actively scavenge 2-nonenal from the skin, neutralizing the smell. We chose to look for these strains within the natural human skin flora. Human sweat is rich in fatty acids ( Callewaert et al., 2014 ), and lipophilic phenotypes are common among skin isolates. Natural skin bacteria are pre-adapted to the skin environment, so are more likely to be viable and metabolically active. We prepared minimal 2-nonenal plates and inoculated them with human skin samples. M9 agar plates were prepared with 0.2% 2-nonenal solubilized with 0.05% tween 80. No other carbon sources were present. An inoculating loop was used to streak plates with samples collected from human forehead, hands, and outer nose. In total we sampled 3 body sites from 8 individuals. We isolated three bacteria strains capable of growing on 2-nonenal (Fig. 5). Colonies appeared after 1 week. The strains were identified by 16S sequencing with universal primers (Box 1, information on each strain). We chose to focus further experiments on Micrococcus luteus as it performed the best in the M9 the 2-nonenal medium. M. luteus is a natural human skin bacterium and a well-described oligotroph, or nutrient scavenger. Their genome sequence indicates a complete fatty acid degradation pathway, meaning they can plausibly degrade 2-nonenal. We next sought to characterize the degradation of 2-nonenal by M. luteus. We first identified the smell detection threshold of 2-nonenal. Human smellers could consistently detect 2-nonenal at a concentration of 1000ppm (Fig. 6). While this work was in progress, we learned that 2-nonenal is bactericidal for many species at concentrations as low as 1000 ppm ( Cho et al., 2004 ) We therefore determined a threshold of toxicity of 2-nonenal for M. luteus. LB agar plates were prepared with varying concentrations of 2-nonenal. Growth of M. luteus was significantly inhibited at 2-nonenal concentrations above 1250ppm. 2-nonenal smell attenuation M.luteus in medium containing 625 ppm 2-nonenal lowers the intensity of the ‘old people smell’ significantly (p-value: 1.04e-09, HSD turkey test), while C. flaccumfaciens lowers the 2-nonenal smell mildly (p-value: 9.72e-05, HSD turkey test) in comparison to the medium with 625ppm 2-nonenal medium only (Fig. 7).
Methods
Diffusion model of 2-nonenal through air
The model is based on a 2D axisymmetric geometry, with the air modeled as the space 5 cm around the skin surface. Here, the skin surface is kept at a constant concentration, C0 = 2.6 +/- 3.5 ppm (in terms of concentration of skin surface lipids) ( Haze et al., 2001 ). The diffusivity of 2-nonenal through the air was calculated using the Chapman-Enskog theory of gas diffusivity given by the following equation:
D = (1.858E-3 * T(3/2) * (1/M1 + 1/M2)(1/2)) / (p * s122 * w)
where D is the diffusivity of the 2-nonenal
T is the room temperature, 298 K
p is the air pressure, 1 atm
M1 is the mass of the 2-nonenal, 140.22 g/mol
M2 is the mass of the air, 29 g/mol
s12 is the average collision diameter, which is around 340 Angstroms for gas molecules in air, and w is the dimensionless temperature-dependent collision integral, usually on the order of 1.
Thus, the diffusion coefficient of 2-nonenal was tabulated to be 1.687E-9 m2/s.
The odor threshold was a value found in literature for the diffusion of (E)-2-nonenal ( Grosch, 2009 ).
Isolation of strains on 2-nonenal M9 minimal agar with 0.2% 2-nonenal was used for selection of 2-nonenal metabolizing strains. 0.05% tween 80 was used to solubilize the 2-nonenal. No other carbon sources were present. An inoculating loop was used to streak plates with samples collected from human forehead, hands, outer nose and armpit. In total we sampled 3 body sites from 8 individuals. The plates were incubated for one week at 37 °C and then checked for the appearance of colonies. Colony PCR and 16S sequencing Colony PCR was performed with universal 16S rRNA specific primers 8F (5'-AGA GTT TGA TCC TGG CTC AG) and 1492R (5'-CGG TTA CCT TGT TAC GAC TT). Sanger sequencing was performed commercially by GATC Biotech (Germany). Strains were identified by aligning the sequenced DNA fragments to the Greengenes database . Hits with the highest similarity were used to name isolates. 2-nonenal detection threshold Serial dilutions of pure 2-nonenal were prepared in water at dilution factors of 102 104 106 and 108. All samples were solubilized with tween 80 at a concentration of 0.05%. All smell tests were double-blind. Samples were scored by the percentage of smellers who were able to positively distinguish them from tween-only controls. Samples were evaluated by 12 volunteers 20-30 years old, without serious smell disability. Toxicity thresholdToxicity of 2-nonenal was evaluated at a range of concentrations (300 to 10000 ppm) on LB agar plates. M. luteus liquid cultures were grown to saturation in LB, serially diluted, and plated on LB  - 2-nonenal. CFU counts were determined following overnight incubation. Attenuation of 2-nonenal odor 2-nonenal was dissolved in LB at 625 ppm, near the sensitivity threshold we determined for the human nose. Samples were solubilized with tween 80 at 0.05%. LB-nonenal was innoculated with M. luteus, C.  flaccumfaciens, or left as an untreated control. Samples were allowed to incubate overnight at 37 °C. 20 individuals scored all the three samples according to the scale 0 - no smell ; 1 - light smell ; 2 - medium smell, 3 - strong smell. All smell tests used randomized tube labels and opaque tubes to hide the appearance of the media. One-way anova was performed to compare mean scores of the three samples followed by HSD Tukey multiple comparisons of means with 95% family-wise confidence levels.

Having read multiple scientific articles on Alzheimer’s disease (AD), we felt like we had a good grip on the current research. But we felt we were missing something. Our goal in part is to detect the disease, which involves working with doctors. So, we went and good feedback from them.
Dr. David Caplan                              Dr. Mark W. Albers
We first went to talk to Dr. David Caplan (MD, PhD, Professor of Neurology, Harvard Medical School Neurologist, Massachusetts General Hospital) We had a long discussion with him about what the current methods of diagnosis of AD were. It was obvious that the current methods are inadequate. They are solely based on psychological test. Sometimes, it is easy to assess whether a person has the disease, when the characteristics a patient is displaying are abnormal compared to normal aging, but sometimes it is very difficult. Dr. Caplan gave us an example of a 80-year-old MIT civil engineer. He was showing characteristics of AD, yet had brilliant discussions about his work time and again--his symptoms were masked. In the early stages of AD, symptoms can be incredibly varied, depending on where the neural degradation began. “It is all subjective”, Dr. Caplan said. To an expert, sometimes there is no question that the patient is displaying Alzheimer’s symptoms, but very often, even they have to send patients to neuropsychologists, to evaluate symptoms with those of other neural diseases that overlap (eg, Parkinson’s disease). When we asked about early detection for AD, he said, “this is where the field is now.” There are a couple of methods. But they all have their problems. But even if there is a good method, he said, there is currently nothing we can do to treat the disease.
We also talked to Dr. Mark W. Albers (MD, PhD, Assistant Professor of Neurology, Harvard Medical School, Assistant in Neurology, Department of Neurology, Massachusetts General Hospital). We discussed with him the problem of treating the disease even if early detection was possible. He thought the drugs that failed with late Alzheimer’s patients might be effective when the disease had not spread too much. He also told us about a promising drug that was under clinical trials.
We talked to Dr. Albers about our synthetic biology based detection and treatment system. He was enthusiastic about our work. He warned us about the complexities of the disease but also gave us ideas about how we could make it better, for example, by adding a failsafe1 in our system, so that in case of unforeseen complications, it can be switched off immediately. We also talked about delivering our system to brain cells, and how receptive patients would be to the options. He gave us some potential methods that could be effective, such as viral delivery or intrathecal injections, but also told us that if our circuit works, the delivery would be a big project of its own.
When asked about the patient experience, Dr. Caplan and Dr. Albers described Alzheimer’s disease being difficult on the caregivers. Dr. Albers gave us an example of a condition in which a region in the parietal lobe of the brain called insight is damaged. This region is responsible for informing a person whether or not their body is in perfect condition. If it is damaged in Alzheimer’s disease, the patient feels fine and does not know that something is wrong with them. While on the other hand, the caregivers can only watch the patient’s condition deteriorate.
These interviews, on top of providing valuable scientific insight for our project, greatly strengthened our belief of the importance of our project and also elucidated the challenges we would have to overcome.
1We seriously considered this suggestion but did not have the time to implement it over the summer.

WE'RE MIT iGEM
Attributions: Brian Teague (Photography), MIT iGEM (Models)
Our team consists of 12 undergraduates and 3 high school students. Check out our bios below!
James Anderson
James Anderson is a rising senior studying Biology and Earth, Atmospheric, and Planetary Sciences. He is excited to be participating in iGEM because he is interested in the potential applications of Synthetic Biology; an organism's genes are the product of billions of years of evolutionary design, and the opportunity to re-engineer this ancient blueprint for novel functions is something James finds pretty cool. When he's not tooling away at PSets James enjoys backpacking the Appalachian Trail, writing haiku, and creating music. He sometimes makes outrageous claims like he invented the question mark. Sometimes he accuses chestnuts of being lazy.
Lyla Atta
Lyla Atta is a rising sophomore who has declared Chemistry as her major, even though she has no idea what she really wants to major in. She is currently considering anything from Courses 20, 3, 5 or 10 to 2 or 6. She is very interested in cellular biology and biochemistry, and especially interested in applications of these areas to neurobiology. At some point in the far (or near?) future she wishes to find science-based answers to questions that were previously thought to be philosophical: what is thinking, understanding and learning? How do all these processes occur in systems that are made up of mere chemicals. MIT iGEM presented a great opportunity for Lyla to get some laboratory experience (which she was in dire need of, having never worked in a lab before) while working on a project she was passionate about with a team of hilariously fun people that she enjoys spending time with. Outside science-related things, Lyla is very interested in education policy and enjoys outdoor activities.
Kathryn Brink
Kathryn Brink is a rising junior at MIT majoring in Biological Engineering.  She is excited to be participating in this year’s iGEM competition since she thinks that synthetic biology is a really interesting field with a lot of great applications to medicine, agriculture, and the environment.  Kathryn was first introduced to Synthetic Biology through a project-based class where, as part of a team, she designed a genetic circuit to regulate iron absorption in the small intestine, with the goal of helping patients with iron-deficiency anemia.  Kathryn was previously an undergraduate researcher in the Ploegh Lab at Whitehead Institute, studying the effects of nanobodies on the activity of glycolytic enzymes from S. cerevisiae.  Outside of iGEM, Kathryn is treasurer of Stop Our Silence (a student group concerned with sexual assault awareness), mentors high school girls in science and engineering through the Society of Women Engineers, and is a member of Alpha Chi Omega sorority.
Gary Burnett
Gary Burnett is a rising sophomore at MIT majoring in Computer Science and Electrical Engineering and minoring in Brain and Cognitive Science. He is extremely interested in studying the mechanisms behind how the brain performs computations and applying these techniques to the field of artificial intelligence and machine learning. Inspired by the technology of science fiction, he hopes that synthetic biology can someday be used to improve the speed and efficiency of traditional hardware systems. iGEM will show him what it is currently possible to achieve using biological engineering, thus laying the foundation for his future research opportunities. Outside of iGEM he is a member of MIT’s Track and Field team, competing in the 400m hurdles. In addition he enjoys playing violin, piano, and guitar in impromptu jam sessions with his friends.
Andrew Chen
Andrew was on our team the summer after his third year of high school as part of the Research Science Institute (RSI) and is now enrolled as an undergrad at Stanford university.
Erik Ersland
Erik Ersland is a sophomore majoring in Biological Engineering.  Erik is participating in iGEM because it offers a good opportunity to contribute useful work to the scientific and engineering community and because it provides training and perspective that will help him continue to contribute in the future.  Previous experience includes two summers interning at Clearwater Analytics as a software developer and numerous garage based projects.  He is interested in research that will improve human quality of life, namely technologies with applications in regenerative medicine.  Hobbies outside of iGEM include learning about new things, cooking (often for groups), sewing (things like plushies), and mechanical projects.
Alexa Garcia
Alexa Garcia is a rising sophomore in the Department of Biological Engineering at MIT. A long time ago, she discovered that amongst her many passions, the one that burns the brightest is her desire to heal the earth. And so began her quest: Alexa’s dream of a greener planet, supplemented perfectly by her love for biological studies, has led her into the field of synthetic biology, and consequently, iGEM. With no previous research experience, she eagerly joined the MIT iGEM 2014 team. It is her hope that the iGEM journey will enrich her knowledge and understanding of bioengineering, and better equip her to pursue her own future research. She aims to, one day, engineer an ecofriendly solution to the world’s pollution problem, as well as to promote reforestation and environmental repair efforts in affected areas. Aside from iGEM, Alexa occupies multiple positions on her dormitory’s executive board, is member of Sigma Kappa sorority, and is involved with the Tech Catholic Community. And though all these wonderful activities take up most of her time, one can always be sure to find Alexa doing her favorite thing of all: dancing her heart out, on and off the stage.
Alex Leffell
Alex Leffell is a rising sophomore in the Mechanical Engineering department. His interest in synthetic biology stems from his fascination in the complexity of biological systems and his desire to create them. He enjoys pondering in reverence about the possibilities synthetic biology creates for technology and society. He sees iGEM as a way to be a part of this future. In his free time, you can find Alex tinkering away on a moped or crafting a piece of fine furniture.
Raymond Liu
Raymond Liu is a rising sophomore in Biological Engineering. For him, iGEM is an opportunity to tinker with the idea of designing biological systems with a degree of autonomy he's never had before. Raymond works in the Picower Institute for Learning and Memory in the Xu lab, working on uncovering the molecular mechanisms of synaptic plasticity. At this point, he's not really too sure what he wants to do with his life, but after having lived in 4 different countries in his life, he's comfortable with a bit of flexibility. Whatever it is, it will probably involve biology. Raymond is a tenor in MIT Syncopasian, the campus's East Asian a cappella group.
Raashed Raziuddin
Raashed Raziuddin is a senior at the Advanced Math and Science Academy Charter School in Marlborough, MA, and hopes to study bioengineering in the future. In particular, he loves the idea of using genetics as the code and cells as the technology of the future. Regardless whether that pans out or not, he enjoys nature on a regular basis, going hiking, snowboarding, kayaking, and backpacking.
Christian Richardson
Christian Richardson is a rising sophomore majoring in Biological Engineering and minoring in Mechanical Engineering. He has done research in high school using Dictyostelium as a model organism to screen drugs with potential in treating cancer and developmental diseases, but his research with the iGEM team will be his first experience working in a high end lab on a project of his own choosing. Synthetic biology attracted his interest because it is an exciting emerging field that holds a lot of promise for future therapeutics.  He wants to pursue a career in research and development for synthetic biology related therapeutics and believes iGEM is a great way to get a sample of what this career would be like. He enjoys rowing, skiing, kayaking, climbing, backpacking, and generally being outdoors. As a kid he loved building things out of his dad's leftover electrical and carpentry supplies and managed to build, among other things, a 200 meter ranged super soaker, a watermelon trebuchet, and a functioning hover car which was suddenly and mysteriously swallowed by a neighbor's swimming pool. He originally planned not to attend college in favor of a career in emergency medicine, but realized that he can impact many more people with a career developing medical treatments rather than administering them.
Shinjini Saha
Shinjini Saha is a rising sophomore at MIT perpetually questioning her decision to major in Computer Science and Molecular Biology. She thinks the complex workings of a cell are cool, and she thinks that being able to manipulate them is even cooler. She considers iGEM to be a great opportunity to learn the tools and skills she’ll need for world domina—ahem—to master the art of synthetic biology in order to do great things for the world in fields such as cancer research. In her busy-time, she dreads procrastination but does so nonetheless. In her “free”-time, she enjoys sleeping. In her actual free-time, she enjoys making visual and auditory art.
Alex Smith
Alex is sophomore in Mathematics.
Abigail Weiss
Abigail Weiss is a junior in high school.  She jointly holds the record for a 30 minute miniprep.
Jiaqi Xie
Jiaqi Xie is a sophomore studying Biological Engineering at MIT. He is interested in regenerative medicine and tissue engineering. Given past encounters with computer science, he is excited by the innovative basis of synthetic biology and what it implies for biological system design. The next obvious step seemed to be to pursue iGEM and the opportunity and experience that it promises. Debating between academia and medicine, he is glad for this first extensive foray into biological research. Outside of iGEM, he enjoys playing the piano and helps run the Harvard-MIT Mathematics Tournament.

Mentors
Of course, science is impossible without collaboration. Our project would not have been possible if it had not been for the innumerable times we were helped by our undergraduate mentors, our supervisor, Brian Teague, our PI, Ron Weiss and other researchers in the lab. From teaching us how to pipet, debugging our PCR problems to lending us parts to use in our project, providing expert insight on doing western blots or running cytometry on our cells, they were with us all the way. We were also helped throughout the summer by the MIT Bioengineering Department’s Writing and Communication Lab, which instructed us from skills ranging from reading scientific papers to making an effective poster to presenting a good talk. Without all the help and guidance we received, we would be lost.
New England iGEM (NEGEM)
Being in Boston with another hundred colleges and universities around us means it only makes sense for the iGEM teams to meet up. A Boston University tradition started in 2012, the 2014 NEGEM consisted of the BU, MIT, Harvard, Rutgers, Tufts, and Worcester Polytechnical Institute iGEM teams. We met three times throughout the course of our summer, presenting and critiquing our projects and presentations, and discussing possible improvements to research methods, presentation style and effectiveness. We also discussed the possibility collaborations between the teams.
We would like to give our warmest thanks to Traci Haddock and the BU team for organizing this wonderful and useful event.

iGEM Team attributions page
Each team must clearly attribute work done by the student team members on this page.  The team must distinguish work done by the students from work done by others, including the host labs, advisors, instructors, and individuals not on the team roster.
Why do we have this requirement?
Attribution Template
We have this requirement to help the judges know what you did yourselves and what you had help with. We don't mind if you get help with difficult or complex techniques, just be sure to report the work your team did and the work that was done by others.
For example, you might choose to work with an animal model during your project. Working with animals requires getting a license and applying far in advance to conduct certain experiments in many countries. This is something that is difficult to achieve during the course of a summer, but much easier if you can work with a postdoc or PI who has the right licenses.
A great example of complete attribution comes from the Imperial College London 2011 team (scroll down to the bottom of their team page to see attributions).
Here are some of the fields we recommend you have on this page. If there are other areas not listed below, but applicable to your team/project, please feel free to also list them on your attributions page. Please feel free to remove any areas not applicable to your project.
General Support
Project support and advice
Fundraising help and advice
Lab support
Difficult technique support
Project advisor support
Wiki support
Presentation coaching
Policy & Practices support
Thanks and acknowledgements for all other people involved in helping make a successful iGEM team.

①Weekly Newsletter
In order to know more about iGEM teams all  around the world and enhance the cooperation among us, we have joined the  Weekly Newsletter launched by Xiamen   University and become one  of the first teams to collaborate with them on this activity.
The  newsletter usually has two major parts: project update and team stories. We should  be writing about one of the parts every two weeks. What’s more, we share funny  stories about our experiments and members. Through this activity, all the teams  will be able to keep better record of their own projects, gain feedback from  their peers and get to know other young synthetic biologists.
②A Nationwide Questionnaire
In  order to investigate the spread and uptake of synthetic biology and IGEM  competition in universities, we made a survey on the internet, through a  wide-spread and professional platform for online questionnaire survey,  Questionnaire star. We promote our questionnaire within the scope of all  colleges in China  as far as possible. According to the investigation, students coming from  hundreds of schools have participated in the survey, including not only high  school and undergraduate students, but also graduate students. So we can  roughly believe that the results are authentic.
According  to our results, we can see that the great majority of the respondents are  undergraduate students, 1.24% of them are high school students and 0.62% are  graduate students. There are also 1.86% staffs and 3.73% other people. On the  other hand, 52.8% of them are men while 47.2% of them are women.
How  many people know about the concept of synthetic biology? We are very pleased to  find 40.37% respondents answered “yes”. As for the question, “Do you know some  applications of synthetic biology in our contemporary life?” 44.1% people  illustrate that synthetic biology has not yet entered their lives. 52.17% said  they have their own?? comprehension;  synthetic biology has been involved in many areas in life. We can see that only  3.73% people understand synthetic biology very well; synthetic biology has got  great achievements in pharmaceutical, bio-energy, medical and many other fields.  Faced with safety issues of synthetic biology, 40.37% people indicate that they  would follow scientific principles to support the development of synthetic  biology. While 55.28% people support precautionary principle, emphasizing the  necessity to improve the supervision mechanism. 4.35% showed an attitude that  they do not care the safety problem, they will use as long as they can be  applied to life.
78.88%  people think people should be involved in the supervision and management of  biotechnology. 21.12% people disagree; they hold that people are so lack of  relevant biological knowledge that they cannot have a comprehensive  understanding of science.
If you have the opportunity to learn  synthetic biology-related courses and take part in IGEM, would you like to have  a try? 57.14% people answered yes, they expressed an willingness to have a try,  but do not attempt to spend too much time or energy. However, 24.84% people are  very glad to join IGEM. There are also 18.01% people that are not very  interested in it. If people have taken part in an IGEM team, 36.02% of them want  to study the environment and energy direction. 50.31% people are interested in  medical and pharmaceutical direction. 9.94% people suggest to study  agriculture, and green manufacturing direction. Whereas, 3.73% people prefer to  study other directions.
If you can assemble the gene sequences of  different modules to customize an e. coli with special features are various,  what functions do you want to realize most? The answers are various, to treat  diseases, prevent cancer, lose weight, generate electricity, etc.
What  is the most urgent problem that synthetic biology should solve? We designed four answers: treatment and prevention of human  diseases, command of environment pollution, efficient energy production,  construction of appropriate ethical system. The results are as follows:
It is obvious that  the great majority people support “treatment and prevention of human diseases”  as the most urgent problem. “command of environment pollution” are in the  second place, followed by “efficient energy production”. “Construction of  appropriate ethical system” was the least.
From this questionnaire, we can easily draw  the conclusion that synthetic biology has been developed to some extent in  universities in contemporary China,  but not very well. The great majority of people do not know synthetic biology  or IGEM at all, according to our data. To our relief, most people already have  some comprehension to synthetic biology. Although faced with safety issues,  many people showed a supportive attitude to the development of synthetic  biology. A large percent of people hold the belief that they should possess the  power to monitor it. Frankly speaking, there’s a long way to go before  realizing people’s demand. There being a vast part of people have the desire to  join IGEM, we hope that synthetic biology could be understood by more people,  we hope people with such dreams could be able to achieve their goals one day,  we hope those worries that people have about synthetic biology could be solved  earlier, we hope that more robust management system could be established as  soon as possible. As great fans of synthetic biology, as students with great  dreams of Tianjin   University, we will  spread knowledge of synthetic biology heart and soul. We believe synthetic  biology will have a better future tomorrow!

On July 31, 2014, our team visited Tianjin  Institute of Industrial Biotechnology, Chinese Academy  of Sciences, sharing some perspectives of our project and discussing the  direction of further application.
After providing them with our preliminary  plan, we consulted professors there on our weakness and difficulties,  concentrating on the potential applications of our project. In addition to the  detection of the concentration of certain micro-molecules or macro-molecules,  we were inspired that we may also measure the expression level of different  promoters by using our platforms.
Though  we know our team may be faced with a lot of difficulties from our visit, we  also enjoyed the special tour. New ideas can be inspired through good  communication. It provided us with a great opportunity to know deeper about our  projects and synthetic biology.
 
（2） Communication with BIT
On September 18, 2014, our team came to Beijing  Institute of Technology (BIT) for a brief discussion on our projects. We each  made a presentation and exchanged the ideas on both. Through their  illustrating, we were well impressed by general idea and delicate design of their  project. Apart from the project, we also consulted Professor Zhang Xunwen from School of Aerospace Engineering on some  experimental devices, namely an ammeter with accuracy at a magnitude of 10-12.  Though we didn’t get the proper device at last, we gained a lot of helpful  suggestions. We did learn a lot!
This meeting helped us come to a better  understanding and not only of the limitations of our project itself but also of  the innovative thinking for developing an overarching structure for a new  biological system.
（3）Cooperation with NKU iGEM 2014
We carried out a work of mutually help  collaborating with Nankai   University iGEM Team. We planned  to help each other in several ways. To begin with, we launched a exchange  conference in Oct 13, 2014. Both team made a brief introduction about the  project firstly. Through their illustration, we were pleased to know that their  project is about the synthesis of rhamnolipid from microbes to assist the oil  exploitation. Then our team introduced our project and shared the experiences  and difficulties on the experiments. In the following part of “Prospecting”, we  exchanged our idea about our project on potential applications and blueprinted  our further cooperation.
In  addition, due to the lack of experiences and related laboratory reagents, we  were not able to do SDS-PAGE to identify our target protein and roughly  estimate its concentration. So they helped us do the SDS-PAGE and analyze the  results. We were very grateful about that!
④Collaborations
In this busy but unforgettable summer, we  have devoted our greatest passion; put all the thoughts in the iGEM  competition, so as the companions from other universities, I believe. Luckily,  however, we utilized our strengths to aid members of the iGEM community and  received considerable kind and helpful instructions from other teams so that we  can get through many tough moments or come up with new ideas by these joint  efforts.
Collaboration  with Beijing Institute of Technology（BIT）
BIT iGEM team and our team have collaborated  in mutual.
①Firstly, we helped them in  the modeling part. In their MIN system, some AHL was added to the medium at  first. AHL combines with the product of luxR, and they act in concert to  repress the function of promoter R0063. As a result, the MIN system cannot  work. However, AHL will be degraded by the proteins expressed by Aii gene. As  the population of E.coli grows, the concentration of AHL gradually decreases.  When it reaches a threshold value, AHL lose the ability to bind with the  product of luxR. Then the depression of MIN will be removed. MinC proteins and  MinD proteins can bind with each other to form MinCD division inhibitors. The  inhibitors can prevent cell division process. After some time, the number of  cells that are still able to make binary fission will decrease. Eventually all  the cells lose the ability to multiply themselves.
We use a classical model, density-dependent  growth model, for our population of E.coli growing simulation. Also we use some  other differential equations to describe the dynamic change of AHL, LuxR  proteins and MinC proteins. The total equations are as follows:
 
M
The    concentration of total MinC proteins
N
Cell    density
R
The    concentration of total proteins[LuxR]
A
The    number of AHL signal
k
Growth    constant
kA
The    binding rate between AHL and LuxR proteins
kM
Production    rate of MinC.
kR
The    production rate of LuxR proteins
d
The    death rate related with MinC proteins.
di
The    degradation rate of materials.
Then we use these equations to simulate the function  of MIN system. The results are shown as figure 1 and figure 2.
 
Figure 1. The dynamic change of  cell number and total number of LuxR proteins. After a sharp increase, the cell  stopped multiplying themselves. With the growing of E.coli, the total number of  LuxR proteins also increases. The initial value of cell number we set is 3000.
 
Figure 2. The dynamic change of MinC  proteins and AHL signal. The AHL decrease very quickly with the growth of  E.coli. And when AHL comes to the threshold value, the repression of MinC is  removed. So after some time the MinC proteins increase quickly and the cell  division process is inhibited.
 
②In  turn, they have helped us in the measurements of the parts. We send their  sample of K1361007, in which CsgA, the major subunit of curli fiber modified by  twin 7Xhis tag, is under control of a strong constitutive promoter BBa_J23100.  And the K1361007 was arrived in company with a parallel part where BBa_J23104,  a relatively weaker promoter, replaced the BBa_J23100. In order to find the  better fit of promoter, they helped us measure the cell growth curve of each  part and Bradford protein assay was adopted to  monitor the total quantity of secrete protein in matrix.
The  results are as follows:
 
Figure 3.Cell growth curve of  BBa_J23100 and parallel that a relatively weaker promoter was used to control  the CsgA secrete level
 
Figure 4. Absorbency of  secrete protein in culture between K1361007 and parallel. No significant  divergence was found.

Collaboration  with Nankai University(NKU)
We  hosted the 1st  iGEM Exchange  Conference Of TJU Team and NKU Team on Oct. 14th at the Nankai University.
The conference contains three parts: The introduction of Work  Project, Prospect and Mutual Aid.
First of all, mediators of both teams introduced their project.  Nankai University Team introduced their project called Super Petroleum Magician  which is an anaerobic rhamnolipid-producing engineered bacterial strain for  microbial enhanced oil recovery.
And Tianjin University Team  gave a speech about their program named Transfibre which is also called CsgA, a  kind of special fiber that can bind the electric circuit and play the role as  the conductor as its function.
In the experiment part, they helped us to detect our target protein  (CsgA) using SDS-PAGE. Here is the result.
From the result, we could see that the interest protein from cells  was about 15 Kp which was same as what we expected, from which we could infer  that interest protein unsurely existed.

Meet the team!
Abigail
Abigail is a Bachelor of Science student, majoring in Biochemistry and Microbiology. She has previously spent a year working in the DNA testing industry, performing real-time PCR on real world samples, and having a minor hand in some research along the way. She is fascinated by the prospect of contributing to molecular microbiology research that benefits the environment, like bioremediation, and has hopes that one day environmental sustainability can be achievable. Her other interests include staying organised enough to fill all her spare time with socialising, and starting craft projects that may or may not get finished.
Andy
Andy is currently studying for a Bachelor of Science majoring in Microbiology and Molecular Biology and Genetics. He is interested in the diverse and novel ways that microorganisms can metabolize and produce an astounding number of substances. He hopes to find a career developing and discovering ways in which microbes can be used in bioremediation and in industrial applications. Andy also enjoys travelling, bike rides and brewing cider.
Callum
Callum is interested in the complex interactions between humans and microorganisms that impact on human health and society. He is studying a Bachelor of Science majoring in chemistry and cell pathology, and is interested in completing a degree in medicine. Otherwise, Callum finds satisfaction in teaching and tutoring younger people, as well as watching TV and occasionally mountain biking.
Jeanne
Jeanne is currently studying for a Bachelor of Science majoring in Biochemistry and Immuno-biology with prospects of Honours in Microbiology. She has spent the last 4 months helping a Microbiology research laboratory to extract and analyse DNA from human gut microbiota. She hopes to find a career in human interaction with microbes (in the environment, in disease and our microbiome). Outside of science she enjoys art, life sketching and hopes to explore different cultures around the world.
Rokiah
Rokiah is 22 and in her final year of four years studying a double degree of a Bachelor of Arts and a Bachelor of Science at The University of Sydney. She is majoring in English and Biology and hopes to use the communication skills from her Arts degree to help teach people about the beauty and benefits of genetics and molecular biology. Her experience in active laboratory research includes volunteering with a PhD student last year, The School of Biological Sciences Summer Scholarship program last summer, and continuing her work from that project as an assistant in Dr. Mary Byrnes molecular biology and molecular genetics laboratory. This is the biggest project, in terms of scope and people involved, that Rokiah has undertaken and she is really looking forward to seeing both  what her team can achieve. The giant jamboree at the end of the competition is a major draw for Rokiah because she is excited to see  which directions young people are going to take science. After iGEM and graduation she hopes to spend 6 months in South America and then start honours with Dr. Byrne.
Tom
Tom is undertaking a Bachelor of Science majoring in Bioinformatics (and learning a whole lot of biochemistry) and holds a previous Bachelor of Information Systems. He is fascinated by the complex, elegant and emergent systems inherent in life, and looks forward to a time when we might interact with and create these much as we now deal with computer systems. Aside from biology and software development, he enjoys singing, acting, drawing, tai chi, learning Mandarin and travelling. Attempts to keep up with all of these simultaneously have unfortunately been thwarted by several inconvenient truths, among them that days contain only 24 hours; sleep is stubbornly mandatory; and ethics approval for human cloning has still not been granted.
Supervisor
Dr. Nick Coleman
Nick is a senior lecturer at the University of Sydney, and the head of an environmental microbiology and biotechnology research lab. ""With a particular focus on molecular genetic analysis of bacteria capable of degrading pollutants. Applications of this work include the bioremediation of contaminated sites and the development of bacterial biocatalysts for other purposes (eg. pharmaceutical synthesis). Microorganisms able to biodegrade toxic pollutants are intrinsically interesting due to what they can teach us about evolution, especially the ways in which Nature adapts to meet chemical challenges. This work increasingly involves analysis of mobile genetic elements (MGEs, eg. plasmids), which are key players in bacterial adaptation to both industrial pollutants and antibiotics. A better understanding of MGEs would allow us to better predict and manage bacterial evolution, whether this is controlling the spread of antibiotic resistance, understanding the fate of recombinant DNA in the environment, or harnessing the power of MGEs for biotechnology. Other areas of interest include metagenomics, microbial ecology and diversity, and agricultural microbiology.""

About Us
We are the University of Reading's first iGEM team. We are an entirely undergraduate team made up of students from both biology and engineering. As such we wanted a project which allow both disciplines to be utilised.
Meet the Team
Matt Smith
The resident biochemist. Lives off coffee and bagels. Enjoys free wifi. Talks in short sentences.
Samuel Hardy
With a strong background in bacteriology and virology, Sam has a resilient interest in utilising some of our planet’s simplest life forms for good. Also the team photographer, activist and Doge enthusiast. Much wow.
Oscar Sanderson
A key part of the lab team and the only colourblind member of the group. In charge of design and colour coordination. Naturally.
Hannah Collard
Hannah is the Biomedical Scientist of the team. She does all the work.
Sam Podmore
In charge of the engineering side of the project. Sam spends most of his time dreaming of Fourier transforms and consuming as much Iron Bru as humanly possible. He's also been caught drinking soup straight from the can (no, seriously).
Most common saying: ""Yeah, I could model that""
Andrew Moynihan
With a background in chemistry and programming, Andrew joined the team as an engineer,  although he is able to support the team in the lab as well. Tasked with most of the design  and implementation of the web services, he remains the first point of contact for  information on the wiki.
Domonic Falla
The youngest member of the team and yet also generally regarded as the most attractive  member. His youth belies his precocious wisdom, and correspondingly he is looked to as  very much the spiritual leader of the team.
Jonathan Pennell
Is a microbiologist that isn’t a big fan of lab work, nor people really. After recently  discovering the field that is Bioinformatics he generally tends to stick around computers  more so than living things, he understands them. Trusts them... Talks to them...
Eleanor James
The requisite Welsh person, generally regarded as the life and soul of the synthetic biology  party. Loves riding horses and rowing, but hates slow Internet. Don’t mention sheep.
Calum Brown
Calum is the cynical member of the team. With a background in physics, robotics and  electronics, Calum doesn’t understand humour, and/or punctuation. As an engineer he has  the social skills to interact with a wide range of people and as such he forms part of the  public outreach side of the project.
Advisors
Lauren Vallance
""Starbucks?"".
Joel Potts
Advisor to the engineers. Helps with all things programming...if it's in Ruby.
Instructors
Jaroslaw Bryk
Committed to synthetic biology education. Currently fighting a bagel addiction. Gibson Assembly FTW.
Slawomir Nasuto
Professor at The University of Reading within the School of Systems Engineering. Interested in neuroscience, neuroanatomy and brain computer interfaces

iGEM Team attributions page
Each team must clearly attribute work done by the student team members on this page.  The team must distinguish work done by the students from work done by others, including the host labs, advisors, instructors, and individuals not on the team roster.
Why do we have this requirement?
Attribution Template
We have this requirement to help the judges know what you did yourselves and what you had help with. We don't mind if you get help with difficult or complex techniques, just be sure to report the work your team did and the work that was done by others.
For example, you might choose to work with an animal model during your project. Working with animals requires getting a license and applying far in advance to conduct certain experiments in many countries. This is something that is difficult to achieve during the course of a summer, but much easier if you can work with a postdoc or PI who has the right licenses.
A great example of complete attribution comes from the Imperial College London 2011 team (scroll down to the bottom of their team page to see attributions).
Here are some of the fields we recommend you have on this page. If there are other areas not listed below, but applicable to your team/project, please feel free to also list them on your attributions page. Please feel free to remove any areas not applicable to your project.

For example, you might choose to work with an animal model during your project. Working with animals requires getting a license and applying far in advance to conduct certain experiments in many countries. This is something that is difficult to achieve during the course of a summer, but much easier if you can work with a postdoc or PI who has the right licenses.

Safety
Would any of your project ideas raise safety issues?
Researcher safety: Our lab is a relatively safe one, as the only organisms we use are E. coli and S. cerevisiae, which are considered level 1 Biosafety Containment Agents so are not pathogenic. We do handle Bunsen burners, chloroform and phenol. Therefore, the largest risks that are presented within the lab include potential fires or exposure to fumes. However, the chloroform and phenol are only ever handled in a fume hood so the risk of exposure to fumes is minimized. In addition, all members must pass the university courses for WHMIS, general laboratory safety, biosafety and autoclave handling prior to entering in the lab.
Public safety: The strains that we use in the lab are non-pathogenic. Although we do genetically modify the organisms that we use, they never could possibly make it into the external environment due to the fact that we use decontamination techniques such as autoclaving and bleaching. The organisms that we modify may contain genes that are less advantageous than those seen in wild type strains, as we occasionally knock out genes that have an impact on the metabolism of the organism, such as genes that pertain to adenine metabolism. There are no risks to the biosecurity of different groups of people. The modifications that we make to the organisms that we use in the lab could not possibly cause the organisms to become pathogenic.
Environmental safety: The genes that we modify in the organisms that we use typically impact their metabolic processes such that they are not as ""fit"" as the same strains in the external environment. The wastes that we dispose are autoclaved first before they are disposed of. The phenol and chloroform waste that our lab produces is shipped to another facility that is designed to handle chemical waste. Overall, the amounts of phenol and chloroform that are used within the lab are so small that there should not be any environmental repercussions if they were to escape from the lab without being sent to a chemical handling facility first.
In order to reduce these risks, we only work with organisms that are of a level one biosafety containment, meaning that they are non-pathogenic. In order to fully assure that the organisms that we do use within the lab do not make their way out of it, we decontaminate any live samples that are used once we are finished with them. This also includes antibiotics, which we sterilize in order denature them so that they do not have any harmful effects on the environment. We do so through the use of sterilization techniques such as autoclaving. Our lab in general is very secure (ie. An access card is required to get into the lab, any side-entrances into the building are locked after hours, and there are security guards stationed within the building,) so there is a very low chance that any malicious persons will obtain access to the genetically modified organisms that are present within our lab.
View the About our Lab and Safety sheets for uOttawa iGEM 2014.
Is there a local biosafety group, committee, or review board at your institution?
The University of Ottawa has a Biosafety Committee that works with the Office of Risk Management and the Vice President of Research to ensure that all biosafety regulations are met. A lengthy description of their role can be found here .
Our lab falls under BSL-1, meaning that no special design and practice features are necessary as we are not working with organisms which are dangerous if ingested or airborne. The sections of the guide dealing with recombinant DNA and genetic manipulation state that most recombinant DNA work is safe, but containment level and pathogenicity should be considered. Containment level is addressed above, and none of the strains we worked with was pathogenic. Therefore, we did not need to discuss our project with the biosafety committee.
All lab members are required to take both a biosafety course and a lab safety course prior to getting their access card for the lab. Each course consists of a full day of lecture outlining risks and necessary precautionary measures followed by a take home exam that is marked by the lecturer. Upon passing the exam, lab members received certificates to verify that they had passed and could work in the lab.
In addition, the Government of Canada has issued a lengthy set of guidelines pertaining to biosafety.

January
Recruitment begins for the uOttawa 2014 iGEM team.
March
March 2nd to March 8th Leaders for each of the sub-teams were selected. Project brainstorming began, and will continue until May.
March 26th to April 1st: Research into cancer-fighting project based on MMPs, and cell memory are pursued.
April
April 11th to April 18th: Research into tri-stable switches and cellular decision making began after a conversation with Dr. Mads Kaern. Other ideas turned out to be non-viable within the four-month research window.
April 19th to April 26th:Initial designs for the tri-stable network proposed.
April 27th to May 3rd:Lab prepared by Dylan Siriwardena for incoming new students. Reagents were prepared, and necessary strains streaked out from cold stock.
May
May 4th to May 10th: Training has begun! Upon finishing the winter semester, the wet lab team began its training in the lab. The new members of the lab who did not have lab experience learned various techniques that would be used over the course of the entire summer, such as PCR, genomic extractions, and transforming constructs into yeast cells. Theory was also taught this week.
May 11th to May 17th: Successful PCRs were achieved by all members. The wet lab team moved onto creating dimers and multimers of PCR amplicons.
May 18th to May 24th: Training construction complete, transformations and confirmations were conducted for the rest of the month. Confirmation includes both PCR and flow cytometry.
May 25th to May 31st: Training completed. Research and understanding of the tri-stable switch was focused on this week, to ensure all wet lab members had a solid understanding. Additional meetings with Dr. Kaern as well as a the construction of a research proposal has purified the many ideas into two solid designs.
June
June 1st to June 7th: Research into pigments was completed, to be used as a reporter and a possible paint application. Primers were designed and ordered to construct the various promoters needed in both designs. Much of this month was dedicated to running PCR after PCR in order to obtain a high concentration and quantity of the fragments that make up the final construct that we were to create. We even had an all-nighter during the month in which the entire night was dedicated to running PCRs!
June 8th to June 14th: Primers arrived, construction of test constructs with each promoter is started. Since many of the sections of the promoters are common, pGalTx was first obtained, and then modified to get the variety of activating and repressing regions. Lex constitutive promoters were also designed.
June 15th to June 21st: It was found that the constitutive promoter we were using to express our repressor was too weak (mrp7). In order to remedy that, we are creating a new strain with a strain with a much stronger promoter (pADH1) in the hope of visualizing strong repression by hindrance.
June 22nd to June 28th: Success! Repression by hindrance was shown to strongly repress in pGalTx, with pADH1 driving rTTA. Other test constructs coming along, with the first few promoters constructs being completed, and the next round being started.
June 29th to July 5th: Second round of promoters are completed and are being confirmed. Promoters with varying numbers of sites were now being constructed in order to have promoters with sufficient expression. It was found that modifying so close the TATA box significantly reduced promoter activity.
July
July 6th to July 12th: More transformations of promoter constructs that we had created into different strains of yeast that were previously created in the lab. In doing so, we could appreciate the effects that the already modified genes in the various strains of yeast would have on the regulation of the promoters. Within our spare time of course, we amplified more of the same monomers that we had used to create the tested constructs, so that if worse came to worst we could easily re-create the construct again or modify it in numerous ways.
July 13th to July 19th: Many constructs confirmed from previous transformations, full gradients were conducted in order to characterise the first round of promoters created.
July 20th to July 26th: Final round of promoters were completed and transformed. Testing of colonies continues.
July 27th to August 2nd: We had achieved the final promoter test strains that we had sought after for the entire summer thus far. Of course we knew it would probably need to be modified and possibly be re-created if the testing of it proved it to be feeble. Thus, upon transforming it into different strains of yeast we tested many colonies and used many different drug concentrations over the course of our analysis of the final construct. We created entire new constructs just in case anything were to fail.
August
August 3rd to August 9th: Problem with our phusion was found, accounting for failed PCRs for the past week. On the bright side PCR talent has increased due to the many failures and redos.
August 10th to August 16th: Final confirmations of all the promoter constructs with both PCR and flow cytometry. All promoters now fully characterised. Beginning of final construction of tri-stable switch.
August 17th to August 23th: PCRs and preliminary transformations were preformed for the two designs for the tri-stable switch.
August 24th to August 30th: Constructs were tested and confirmed. Only a few strains appeared to confirm, but another round of transformation was required to be sure.
August 31st to September 6th: With school starting up again, we each spent a significantly less amount of time in the lab, and most of the time that we spent in the lab was concentrated on testing out the constructs that we had obtained during August. Much larger drug concentrations were performed within our flow sessions, so that we could present the modelling team with sufficient data for the figures that they were to create. September overall was largely a month of transformations, testing failures, reconstructions, transformations, and then more disappointments.
September
September 7th to September 13th: All previous constructs failed to flow confirm, have to troubleshoot which parts are non-functional. Entirely new constructs which contained new monomers, and were entirely different from the constructs that we had worked with previously. We also spent some time frustratingly creating the BioBricks that were to be submitted to the iGEM HQ with long-expired endonucleases.
September 14th to September 20th: Transformations were tested, and GFP constructs confirmed. Sadly anything BFP-related along with rTTA did not. BFP will be removed and replaced, as well as the rTTA, meaning more construction.
September 21th to September 27th: Transformations failed again, rTTA will not PCR out properly, and we believe the promoter driving BFP maybe the problem.
September 28th to October 4th: Crunch time for the wet lab. Although we did have enough data to at least present the intricacies of the tri-stable switch, we really wanted to establish one ourselves. The problem is, with all of the time spent in testing colonies, we had little time left to start over again if such a thing was needed. With testing of the construct failing, we decided to shift our primary focus to gathering together all of the data that we did manage to retrieve over the course of the summer so that our wiki could be well completed.
October
October 5th to October 11th: Transformations all failed to confirm last week, last chance to build the final construct with the time left. Ran the all-nighter to end all all-nighters. Biobricks purified and sent in this week on Tuesday.
October 12th to October 18th: Wiki freeze is approaching! Last data on promoters is collected and write ups for the wiki are completed.
Attributions and Collaborations
uOttawa
The wet lab undergraduate team consists of Dylan Siriwardena, Shihab Sarwar, Alexandra Tzahristos, Sarah Mohand-Said and Martin Hanzel. All members helped construct all biobricks, promoter test constructs, and the final network. Flow cytometry was conducted by all members, with a majority done by Shihab Sarwar and Dylan Siriwardena. Martin Hanzel constructed and tested all E. coli strains used for the Measurement interlab-study. Dylan Siriwardena completed the network designs for the tri-stable switch, with the significant assistance of team advisor Ian Roney and supervisor Dr. Mads Kaern.
The many test strains created for each novel promoter were based upon Ian41, a strain created by Ian Roney. Ian Roney also provided significant assistance with training, day-to-day troubleshooting, and technical advice on many protocols. Our lab technician, Mila Tepliakova, assisted in training, gave indispensible advice on improving our methods, and provided stock solutions throughout the year. Finally, Dr. Mads Kaern provided the team with resources, including reagents, machines, and access to a flow cytometer, as well as providing extensive advice and support.
In fact, the entire Kaern lab provided support for the undergraduate wet lab, including Ian Roney, Afnan Azizi, Hilary Pheonix, Nada Elnour, and Vaibhav Gupta.
Dry lab:The entirety of the web application ""Brick Builder"" has been created from scratch by Mohammed Chamma, Kevin Rutkay, Peter Doan, Matthew Chandrawan, and Khama Hastick. They are the ones who have enabled the completion of Brick Builder. Mohammed set up the basics of the web app and helped bring iGEM's search tools into Brick Builder. Kevin set the basics of presenting search results and saved parts in the ""Brick Bin"" in a table. Peter translated RFC methods into computer programming codes and created a GUI for the construction of parts. Matthew helped reorganise the tables and paginated them so as to easily sort and search for parts. Khama created a tool tip for ease of understanding the functions of Brick Builder.
The members of the modeling team Danny Salem, Joey Irani, Alex Huluta and Cory Lefebvre designed, implemented and analyzed the models of our system. Cory Lefebvre was responsible for the design of the deterministic ODE models with the help of Sam Hirniak and John Drake from the Waterloo iGEM team, and Danny Salem was responsible for the design of the stochastic model. Joey Irani performed the model fitting of promoter data from the wet lab and parameterization.  Joey Irani, Alex Huluta and Cory Lefebvre performed stability and sensitivity analyses of the deterministic models and Danny Salem did the same for the stochastic models.
Policy and Practices: Members who were involved in the Let’s Talk Science collaboration in various capacities include: Abdus Anwar, Jenna Khawas, Nicholas Huang, Yara Abou-Hamde, Kaitlin Kharas, Peter Doan and Curtis Quan. All in-class presentations were done by Abdus Anwar. Members of the team who led activities at the various fairs and festivals (as well as at the Children’s Hospital of Eastern Ontario) include: Yara Abou-Hamde, Nicholas Huang, Joanne Joseph, Kaitlin Kharas, Abdus Anwar, Irene Harmsen, Cory Lefebvre, Alexandra Huluta, Peter Doan, Curtis Quan and Daniel Tesolin. Members of the team who prepared activities and/or presented as part of the Enrichment Mini-Course Program include: Yara Abou-Hamde, Joanne Joseph, Marina Kidisyuk, Joey Irani, Sarah Mohand-Said and Nicholas Huang. The research for the synthetic biology course was done by: Yara Abou-Hamde, Irene Harmsen, Kaitlin Kharas, Joanne Joseph and Lloyd Mai. Survey was designed and data analyzed by Yara Abou-Hamde. Abdus Anwar represented the policy team at the oGEM conference. The patent policy project is being led by Katie Harriman and Yara Abou-Hamde. Other significant contributions were made by Caitlin Johnston, Fiatsogbe Dzuali, Stephanie Gran-Ruaz and Linda Dam.
Collaborations
Waterloo collaboration
This year, we had the opportunity to collaborate with the iGEM team from the University of Waterloo. We were asked to aid in the  construction of three large DNA cassettes into one plasmid.
In order to do so, the uOttawa iGEM team designed a set of primers (6 total) to amplify out each of the DNA cassettes, with overhangs to be used for our labs version of overlap extension PCR. A protocol was written for the uWaterloo team. We also were able to discuss and advise its design and construction.
In return, Sam Hirniak and John Drake from the uWaterloo team helped us design ODE deterministic models for our inducible switch.
Queens collaboration
For the Queens iGEM team, we sent the fusion inducer GEV (gal4 binding domain, human estrogen receptor, and VP16 transactivator) to aid in their design, accompanied with detailed sequence data. We also provided some advice on its use.

MIB & SSB
BananaGuard team would like to thank all members of the Microbiology (MIB) and Systems & Synthetic Biology (SSB) chair groups and their professors Willem de Vos and Vitor Martins Dos Santos at Wageningen University . Both departments gave us the amazing opportunity to be part of iGEM 2014. Apart from the laboratory space and chemicals, they also provided us with unconditional support during the entire iGEM experience, from the initial brain storming sessions to the iGEM Jamboree.
We would to give special thanks to John van der Oost and the laboratory technicians Tom Schonewille, Sjon Hendriks and Ruud Spruijt, who helped us with our doubts and questions while working in the laboratory. We really appreciate Steven Aalvink's, Alex Kruis' and Ton van Gelder’s advices related to high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and Gas chromatography (GC). María Suárez Diez provided unlimited advice and guidance on modelling. Thanks to the dedication of Wim Roelofsen, all the computers in our offices were fully working with all needed software properly installed. Also, we would like to thank Tom van de Weijer and Hauke Smidt for helping us with filling in the safety forms. We also want to thank Phelim Hoey for making our a lot of our photographs. Last but not least, we would like to thank Philippe Puylaert for checking if everything is according to safety rules during the whole iGEM project.
It is important to mention that without the help of all our supervisors , the BananaGuard project could not have come so far. The combination of knowledge and skills of our supervisors was vital to build our project from the scratch. Some were previous iGEM members, others experienced molecular biotechnologists, bioinformaticians, modelers and plant scientists. Without doubt we can say that we were very lucky to have such a diverse group of people giving support to us and our project. Moreover, we highly appreciate all the Saturdays, Sundays and evenings that they spent in the laboratory to give us access and supervision.
Plant Research International
A special thanks goes to Gert Kema’s group from Plant Research International for supporting us from the beginning of our project. We would like to thank to Fernando Garcia Bastidas who was our main advisor for all aspects related to Fusarium infection and plant science knowledge. And also Maricar Salacinas who helped us with one of our interviews. The group was always friendly and very keen on providing us with anything that we needed - whether it was fusaric acid compound, greenhouse space, banana plants, Fusarium data or a GMO license for the greenhouse. We share the goal to save the bananas and together provide alternative solutions. To learn more, have a look at their wonderful website .

iGEM Team attributions page
Each team must clearly attribute work done by the student team members on this page.  The team must distinguish work done by the students from work done by others, including the host labs, advisors, instructors, and individuals not on the team roster.
Why do we have this requirement?
Attribution Template
We have this requirement to help the judges know what you did yourselves and what you had help with. We don't mind if you get help with difficult or complex techniques, just be sure to report the work your team did and the work that was done by others.
For example, you might choose to work with an animal model during your project. Working with animals requires getting a license and applying far in advance to conduct certain experiments in many countries. This is something that is difficult to achieve during the course of a summer, but much easier if you can work with a postdoc or PI who has the right licenses.
A great example of complete attribution comes from the Imperial College London 2011 team (scroll down to the bottom of their team page to see attributions).
Here are some of the fields we recommend you have on this page. If there are other areas not listed below, but applicable to your team/project, please feel free to also list them on your attributions page. Please feel free to remove any areas not applicable to your project.
General Support
Project support and advice
Fundraising help and advice
Lab support
Difficult technique support
Project advisor support
Wiki support
Presentation coaching
Policy & Practices support
Thanks and acknowledgements for all other people involved in helping make a successful iGEM team.

Wen Wu
Wen (Wenny) is in the second year of her Master in Biotechnology. She is our team captain and apart from that she keeps herself very busy by helping out in the Sponsor, Wiki and Human Outreach team. In the lab Wenny works on the expression of fungal growth inhibitors in Pseudomonas putida. Next to those official tasks she made it her duty to give motivational speeches from time to time. Wenny struggles with a severe genetically based alcohol intolerance and total unawareness if irony and sarcasm. Additionally, Wenny thinks she is taller than all twelve-year olds but statistically speaking, she is taller than a few twelve year olds.
How will we remember Wen:
“Pink fluffy unicorns, dancing on rainbows.”
Bob van Sluijs
Bob, Bobo or Robert (he isn’t quite sure if he likes that one, though) just finished his Bachelor in Biotechnology and will start his Master in Biotechnology this fall. Within the team he works on the modeling of the kill-switch and he is one of our two PR-persons. With Bobo around it never gets boring. He entertains the team with anecdotes about his time as a diving instructor in Australia or awkward situations during dates. If you meet Bobo at the Jamboree ask him for a funny story, he will not disappoint.
How will we remember Bob:
*Dancing and singing:*
“I’m a banana, I’m a banana,
peel the banana, peel the banana,
go bananas, go, go bananas!”
Jeremy van Baalen
Jeremy is in his second year of his Master in Biotechnology. Within the team he works on the construction of a fusaric acid inducible promoter and he is one of our two PR-persons. You might have already made his acquaintance if you follow us on Twitter or Facebook. Next to his official tasks on the team, Jeremy is also responsible for the music choice in the lab. With the love for the music he spends his free time working as a DJ. We know Jeremy as a very kind and caring person who has a funny flaw: telling very inappropriate jokes, which luckily for him, make everybody laugh.
How will we remember Jeremy:
*Random conversation* ...“That's what she said!”
“Jeremy, that’s creepy.”
“Yeeeeezzzzz!”
Teresa Robert Finestra
Coming from the Catalan region of Spain, Teresa came to the Netherlands to do her Master’s degree in Biotechnology. Having worked in an anti-doping lab, she was on the front line of making professional sports a little bit fairer. She has shown exceptional grace playing tennis and squash given the difficulty of staying balanced (tiny feet and all). Teresa works on the horizontal gene transfer inhibition project using her amazing transformation skills to obtain a viable product. Don’t be too shy to say hello to Teresa at the jamboree. With her outgoing personality we are sure she would be more than happy to talk about the project.
How will we remember Teresa:
“Nee, Jeremy, nee!” (Nee is Dutch for no.)
Marlène Birk
Marlène is our lovely and politically correct plant biotechnologist from Germany. Within the team she works on the kill-switch and is part of the Sponsor team. Furthermore, she is responsible for the work done in the greenhouse, which is – given her background – the place she feels most comfortable. Outside of the lab, she is quick with a witty response or movie reference and she keeps everyone on their toes. When you leave her alone with your computer with your Facebook still logged in, she will probably mess it up by changing your profile picture, date of birth or fill your wall with embarrassing posts.
How will we remember Marlène:
(in angry German accent) “Ven ze PlasmiT is intergraitet in to ze organismus, ze hoel grup vil be ful of joy.”
Kevin Hof
Kevin just finished his Bachelor in Biotechnology with a minor in Economics and is starting his Master in Biotechnology this fall. Within the team, Kevin works on the double dependent plasmid system that avoids horizontal gene transfer and he is the head of our Sponsor team. He knows his way around the lab and if your ego can stand his smug smile he will always help you with his expertise. Explaining difficult things in a very simple, understandable way is one of his strongest points followed by getting whatever he wants by imitating the facial expression of a cute lost puppy.
How will we remember Kevin:
Marlène: “Oh sweety, listen....”
Kevin: “NO! Don’t ‘Oh sweety’ me!”
Rik van Rosmalen
Rik just finished his Bachelor in Molecular Life Sciences and will start his master this fall. Within the team he works on … well, everything. Officially, Rik is responsible for fusaric acid resistance within the biological control agent and works on the Wiki and the Sponsor team but he is involved in almost all projects and teams to a certain degree. Seemingly always patient and friendly, Rik will wait for two months for samples from Taiwan and still gets his work done. It’s magic! If you want to make Rik angry use a butter knife to chop tomatoes, but apart from that there is nothing you can do to get him off balance.
How will we remember Rik:
“Rik, how do you do that?”
“Like this.”
“IT’S MAGIC!”
Max van der Ploeg
Max just finished his Bachelor thesis in Biology this summer but in between got thrilled with synthetic biology and will start the Biotechnology master’s program this winter. Within the team he works on the kill-switch system. The circuit of this system is strongly influenced by Max’s enthusiasm for the genetic toggle switch. He presented the first version of the kill switch to the team drawn on a piece of napkin, because paper was not at hand when he had his flash of inspiration. Max is full of energy and his laughter is contagious. In Boston just follow the most funniest, loud and the most cheerful laughter and say hi to Max.
How we will remember Max:
Very passionately: “This is super amazing!!”
Michiel Herpers
Michiel just finished his Bachelor in Biotechnology and will start his master’s degree this fall. Within the team he works on the kill-switch system. Next to that he is one of our two secretaries. He possesses mad transformation and Microsoft Paint skills and takes great pride in both. Michiel is a very neat person and puts a lot of effort into his appearance. Sometimes he surprises us randomly wearing the banana suit in the lab.
How will we remember Michiel:
“Oh, that is a great song!”
“Michiel, the 80's just called and they want their music back.”
Miguel Correa Marrero
Miguel (Miguelito) is an enthusiastic team member from the Canary Islands and is in his second master year in Bioinformatics. Within the team he works on a model that describes the inhibition of horizontal gene transfer. Since the start of the project, he was a big supporter of the idea to save the bananas, which includes the daily wearing of banana-yellow shirts with monkeys on them. For lunch he enjoys his daily rice salad, although the definition of rice salad is still somewhat ambiguous.
How will we remember Miguel:
“It’s a banana PLANT, not a tree!”
Tjaša Marolt
Tjaša (Ti-asha) is our Slovenian import currently in the second year of her master in Biotechnology. Her tasks in the team are the expression of chitinase in P. putida and the addition of the necessary fluffiness to our wiki page. Originally, Tjaša joined the Wiki team to contribute her creative talents but soon developed a passion for coding. Next to those tasks she is responsible for the lab-safety and to keep the spirits up by feeding the whole team “super sweet” pastries and explaining the “super exciting” features of SnapGene to everyone who couldn’t leave the room fast enough. Tjaša’s newest passion is the 3D-printer she saw a few weeks ago and we are looking forward to hearing about it every lunch.
How will we remember Tjaša:
“Uuuu! Me likey, likey!”
Walter de Koster
Walter just finished his Bachelor in Biotechnology and will start his Master this fall. Within the team he works on the metabolic model of the anti-fungal production and is active within the sponsor team. Even though Walter is one of our modelers he didn’t completely leave his laboratory background behind. When there wasn’t enough data in literature to validate his model he went right to the lab. Apart from this he’s always happy to grab a cup of coffee and hear you complaining about why your experiment failed again this time, patiently waiting until you’ve realized yourself what you did wrong.
How will we remember Walter:
“KH2PO4 ..... K2HPO4. Well, close enough!”
Sophia Wang
Honorary team member
Sophia just started the second year of her Master in Food Safety. Despite being extremly busy doing her master thesis, she enthusiastically offered her help to the Wiki team. She is an experienced iGEM member ( XMU-China 2012 ) and has a secret passion and talent for coding, succesfully leading us through all the traps and dangers of the different browsers. Sophia put some glorious sparks to our Wiki integrating Javascript to the project overview scheme, designing the interactive menubar and much more.
How will we remember Sophia:
Wiki team: “Sophia, could you please do X, Y & Z?”
*30 minutes later*
Sophia: “Done, it was very easy!”
 
Supervisors
Christian Fleck
Dr. Christian Fleck is the leader of the team. In his role as an Associate Professor in the Systems & Synthetic Biology department, Christian’s group researches the effects of light and patterning in biological systems using theoretical and synthetic techniques. As coordinator of the team, Christian has played a large role in organizing lab space, setting up collaborations and meetings with other departments in Wageningen UR and supplying lab materials for the team to take advantage of. In fact, without Christian’s support the WUR team would not be booking their tickets to the Boston Jamboree!
How will we remember Christian:
“Congratulations everyone, we have a new iGEM team this year.”
Gert Kema
Dr. Gert Kema is a Senior Researcher from Plant Research International and the leader of the banana research at Wageningen University. He helped our team with the logistic for the greenhouse space, shipping of the banana plants and with Fusarium oxysporum experiments. He definitely facilitated the successful development of our research. Gert is a dedicated scientist, a good trouble-shooter and a very friendly person. Even though he is an extremely busy man, he will always take time for a good espresso and a conversation with students and colleagues about his favourite topics - bananas and Apples.
How will we remember Gert:
“Don’t worry, it is okay.”
Kees van der Ark
Kees is a PhD student at Wageningen UR in the Microbiology department and an experienced iGEM’er from 2012. He is one of the most optimistic and out-of-the-box thinking supervisors of our team. His advice is not only limited to meetings, but also exceeds to the wet lab at random encounters in the weighing room. And whenever we are down, he reminds us of his own accomplishments 2 years ago, when they finished in the top 16 while they hardly had any results. This is very comforting when our transformations failed again for no good reason.
How will we remember Kees:
“Wiener Melange, can’t start a day without. Beer, can’t end a day without.”
Banana Guard
BananaGuard came all the way from the warm soils of Indonesia to Wageningen to help our team fight Fusarium oxysporum. He explained us how strong and resistant is F. oxysporum and how farmers are struggling to fight this fungus. Thanks to his broad experience in infected areas he gave us a many suggestions on the best way of applying the product on the soil and the most optimal antifungals to use. He had never been abroad before, so he is very much interested in Dutch culture. Now he is an unconditional lover of stroopwafels and uses the bicycle to go everywhere. After the big Boston jamboree he will fly back to his country full of genes and knowledge to fight the Panama disease.
How will we remember BananaGuard:
""It is nice to be important, but it is more important to be nice.""
Fernando Garcia Bastidas
Fernando is a PhD student at Wageningen UR in Plant Research International and dedicates his time to fight the Panama disease. He supervises all greenhouse related experiments and finds last minute solutions for us when the ordered plants don't arrive or when we forgot to book the right greenhouse space. Seemingly ever happy will he always take the time to help us. Working with him is a great pleasure because he makes digging in soil fun.
How will we remember Fernando:
“As soon as the Banana plants are here we can start.”
“When will they be here?”
“I don’t know, and then they need to grow for 3 more weeks before we can start.”
Marnix Vlot
Marnix is a PhD student at Wageningen UR in the Microbiology department, working on the CRISPR-Cas. He himself was a team member of the very successful 2012 Wageningen iGEM team. Marnix is a rather quiet person but when he gives feedback the whole team hangs to his every word. Marnix is very clever and eager to help, if it is in the lab or on the street fixing bikes. If you have ever been to the Netherlands you will know how important it is to be able to fix a bike in this part of the world.
How will we remember Marnix:
“Never underestimate the power of appeal (a peel) in a project.”
Nico Claassens
Nico is a PhD student at Wageningen UR in the Microbiology department. Troubleshooting sessions with Nico is just about the most effective way to overcome stagnation. Due to Nico’s talent to make the most complex things seem easy as pie he became the go-to-person for all wet lab students. This went so far that his colleagues, who share his office put a “Nico is not here”-sign on their door to keep us from entering. It goes without saying that this was of course without success.
How will we remember Nico:
“I grew them overnight, so about 8 hours.”
“You mean 16 hours?”
“Do I? Oh right, I guess.”
“So I guess you learned something today! There’s 24 hours in a day.”
Robert Smith
Rob is the postdoc in the department of Systems and Synthetic biology. He is in charge of the day to day supervision of the iGEM team. Rob is a mathematician by trade, hailing from the shores of Britain. Usually the first person to arrive in the morning, he is the early bird of the department. If he is not working you can probably find him playing field hockey or doing some form of exercise. An unconventional Brit that does not enjoy a cup of tea, he has adapted to the Dutch way of dairy filled sandwiches for lunch and a cup of coffee in the morning. If you see him at the Jamboree feel free to say hello.
How will we remember Rob:
“What do you mean Bob, be more specific.”
Ruben van Heck
Ruben is a PhD student at Wageningen UR in the department of Systems and Synthetic Biology. He was part of the iGEM team of 2011 himself, a supervisor of the 2013 team and he was also a judge in the iGEM competition 2013 (Regional jamboree Lyon). Always friendly and patient to a degree that makes you question his sanity, is he the one that will let us use his car so we can make it on time to important meetings. Moreover, he would come to the lab on public holidays to read a novel so we can work outside of office hours.
How will we remember Ruben:
“Ruben, could you ...[enter an absurd request]..., please?”
“Sure, I think I can make that work.”
Stamatios Damalas
Stamatios is a PhD student at Wageningen UR in the department of Systems and Synthetic Biology. Synthetic biology is not just his job but also his passion. He is supervising the team working on the double dependent plasmid system that avoids horizontal gene transfer. The chances to meet Stamatios in the lab are very high any time between 1 and 11 pm on weekdays and weekends but it is wise to not approach him before he had some coffee.
How will we remember Stamatios:
“Use the SEVA plasmid, it will make it so much easier.”

Project Design and Wet Lab Experiments
The BananaGuard project consists of multiple wet lab modules. Jeremy constructed the fusaric acid sensor while Wen and Tjaša worked on the expression of fungal growth inhibitors . Tjaša focused on chitinase expression while Wen dedicated her time to the other three compounds. The fusaric acid resistance in the biological control agent was Rik’s project. Marlène tested the fungal inhibition in vivo in the greenhouse .
Teresa and Kevin worked on the horizontal gene transfer inhibition and Max, Michiel and Marlène (M&M&M) worked on the Kill-Switch . Max was also responsible for in situ experiments and promoter design.
Walter worked in the wet lab to obtain production kinetic data for the genome-scale metabolic model of Pseudomonas putida.
The iGEM team Wageningen also participated in the Interlab study . Marlène and Rik performed the corresponding experiments.
Modeling
Walter took care of modeling aspects related to metabolic stress , while Bob modeled the killswitch and the behaviour of the system under cell division .
Human Practice
The iGEM team Wageningen established contact between the National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM) and all Dutch iGEM teams. Bob was their main contact person and Jeremy organized the national meet-up at which RIVM participated. For the collaboration with Synenergene an application scenario was generated. Miguel, Max, Rik and Wen were involved in this task. Miguel took charge of everything interview related. Bob appeared in both videos for human outreach.
Wiki Construction
Rik, Teresa and Tjaša learned how to design a wiki in one summer. Combining everyone’s skills we managed to construct an interactive and user friendly wiki, giving the right importance to the layout as well as to the content. Alba Ramos Álvarez , a Fine Arts student, and Wen supported the Wiki-team with their illustration skills. Also, Sophia, the team captain of XMU-China 2012 helped us a lot with the design and coding of the wiki. All icons used in this wiki page were made by Icons8 from www.flaticon.com licensed by CC BY 3.0 .
Finances
The sponsoring team consisted of Kevin, Rik, Walter, Marlène and Wen. The sponsor team was involved in finding and contacting our sponsors . Kevin, supported by Rik, was our treasurer, and together they regulated money flow.
Safety
Tjaša, together with Miguel's help, was responsible for safety within the lab and safety regulations by the government. Marlène was in charge of providing all data for the GMO-permit extension, which was needed for the greenhouse experiment.
Other Team Roles
Wen was the Captain of BananaGuard. Teresa acted as the secretary and Michiel functioned as vice secretary. Marlène arranged our amazing team clothes and she also organized the trip to the Jamboree .
Supervisors
Christian Fleck was the head of the whole team. Kees van der Ark, Marnix Vlot, Nico Claassens and Stamatios Damalas were the supervisors of all the subprojects involving experimental work in the laboratory, while Robert Smith and Ruben van Heck supervised the modelling part. Gert Kema and Fernando Garcia Bastidas from Plant Research International supervised the greenhouse and Fusarium oxysporum experiments.

iGEM Team attributions page
Each team must clearly attribute work done by the student team members on this page.  The team must distinguish work done by the students from work done by others, including the host labs, advisors, instructors, and individuals not on the team roster.
Why do we have this requirement?
Attribution Template
We have this requirement to help the judges know what you did yourselves and what you had help with. We don't mind if you get help with difficult or complex techniques, just be sure to report the work your team did and the work that was done by others.
For example, you might choose to work with an animal model during your project. Working with animals requires getting a license and applying far in advance to conduct certain experiments in many countries. This is something that is difficult to achieve during the course of a summer, but much easier if you can work with a postdoc or PI who has the right licenses.
A great example of complete attribution comes from the Imperial College London 2011 team (scroll down to the bottom of their team page to see attributions).
Here are some of the fields we recommend you have on this page. If there are other areas not listed below, but applicable to your team/project, please feel free to also list them on your attributions page. Please feel free to remove any areas not applicable to your project.
General Support
Project support and advice
Fundraising help and advice
Lab support
Difficult technique support
Project advisor support
Wiki support
Presentation coaching
Policy & Practices support
Thanks and acknowledgements for all other people involved in helping make a successful iGEM team.

We would like to thank the Vanderbilt University School of Engineering for their help in initiating Vanderbilt iGEM. Without their financial support this organization would not have been able to take root at Vanderbilt.
Additionally, the resources of the VIIBRE personal, SyBBURE, and the McCarra lab have been invaluable throughout our project and we hope to utilize their support as iGEM continues to grow at Vanderbilt University.
We would also like to give thanks to the authors of the papers listed below, without their prior research our ideas and methods may never have come to fruition. We thank them for their contributions to microfluidics and hope to continue their work into the future.

From the very beginning, we knew that an undertaking such as the participation in the iGEM competition would be expensive. Not only lab supplies like chemicals and plasticware or the purchase of enzymes and oligonucleotides cost plenty of money, but also registration fees for the competition and the Giant Jamboree as well as travel and accommodation costs come at a price. For us students that are normally not concerned by these costs, it was very interesting to see behind the curtains of how much it costs a 19-person team to participate in such a competition (see pie charts). We like to thank all our generous sponsors for their kind support and also thank all the supporters within the faculty of Biology of the LMU that were always helpful and made our participation in iGEM and our trip to the Giant Jamboree in Boston possible in the first place.
We are deeply grateful for your endorsement!

Hi there!
Welcome to our Wiki! I'm BaKillus, the pathogen-hunting microbe, and I'll guide you on this tour through our project. If you want to learn more about a specific step, you can simply close the tour and come back to it anytime you like. So let's start!
What's the problem?
First of all, what am I doing here? The problem is, pathogenic bacteria all around the world are becoming more and more  resistant against antimicrobial drugs. One major reason for the trend is the inappropriate use of drugs. With my BaKillus super powers, I want to reduce this misuse and thus do my part to save global health.
Sensing of pathogens
To combat the pathogenic bacteria, I simply eavesdrop on their communication. Bacteria talk with each other via quorum sensing systems, which I use to detect them and trigger my responses.
Adhesion
The more specific and effective I can use my powers, the lower the danger is of provoking new resistance development. So I catch pathogens whenever I get hold of them and stick to them until my work is done.
Killing
Talking about my work - killing pathogens is finally what I am made for. In response to quorum sensing molecules of the pathogens, I export a range of antimicrobial substances leading to dissipation of biofilms and the killing of the targeted bacteria.
Suicide switch
When the job is done and all the bad guys are finished, you don't need a super hero anymore. So after fulfilling my work I say goodbye to the world by activating my suicide switch.
Application
Of course I'm not only a fictional hero, but a very real one. In two different prototypes, I could be used for diagnosis or treatment of pathogen-caused diseases. However, there is still a whole lot of regulational and economical questions that have to be answered before.
See you!
So now you know my short story - and it is time for me to return to my fight for a safer world. Feel free to take a closer look on my super powers , the process of my development or the plans for a medical application .

Killing
Talking about my work - killing pathogens is finally what I am made for. In response to quorum sensing molecules of the pathogens, I export a range of antimicrobial substances leading to dissipation of biofilms and the killing of the targeted bacteria.
Suicide switch
When the job is done and all the bad guys are finished, you don't need a super hero anymore. So after fulfilling my work I say goodbye to the world by activating my suicide switch.
Application
Of course I'm not only a fictional hero, but a very real one. In two different prototypes, I could be used for diagnosis or treatment of pathogen-caused diseases. However, there is still a whole lot of regulational and economical questions that have to be answered before.
See you!
So now you know my short story - and it is time for me to return to my fight for a safer world. Feel free to take a closer look on my super powers , the process of my development or the plans for a medical application .

Hi there!
Welcome to our Wiki! I'm BaKillus, the pathogen-hunting microbe, and I'll guide you on this tour through our project. If you want to learn more about a specific step, you can simply close the tour and come back to it anytime you like. So let's start!
What's the problem?
First of all, what am I doing here? The problem is, pathogenic bacteria all around the world are becoming more and more  resistant against antimicrobial drugs. One major reason for the trend is the inappropriate use of drugs. With my BaKillus super powers, I want to reduce this misuse and thus do my part to save global health.
Sensing of pathogens
To combat the pathogenic bacteria, I simply eavesdrop on their communication. Bacteria talk with each other via quorum sensing systems, which I use to detect them and trigger my responses.
Adhesion
The more specific and effective I can use my powers, the lower the danger is of provoking new resistance development. So I catch pathogens whenever I get hold of them and stick to them until my work is done.
Killing
Talking about my work - killing pathogens is finally what I am made for. In response to quorum sensing molecules of the pathogens, I export a range of antimicrobial substances leading to dissipation of biofilms and the killing of the targeted bacteria.
Suicide switch
When the job is done and all the bad guys are finished, you don't need a super hero anymore. So after fulfilling my work I say goodbye to the world by activating my suicide switch.
Application
Of course I'm not only a fictional hero, but a very real one. In two different prototypes, I could be used for diagnosis or treatment of pathogen-caused diseases. However, there is still a whole lot of regulational and economical questions that have to be answered before.

Collaborations
Collaborations and the exchange of knowledge were important aspects during our iGEM participation. Therefore we had an intensive collaboration with the iGEM team Groningen (Netherlands) and laid a high priority on the exchange with the Rathenau Institute also located in the Netherlands. In addition we also took part in the Interlab Study of this year´s iGEM competition.
Interlab Study
Background:
The aim of the Interlab study was to evaluate three devices consisting of different Anderson promoters fused to GFP in two different backbones: the high-copy plasmid pSB1C3 (100-300 copies/cell) and the low-to-medium-copy plasmid pSB3K3 (20-30 copies/cell). The devices were distributed by iGEM and the flourescence evaluation method was free of choice. For more details check: Interlab Study@iGEM
The devices:
Device one: BBa_I20260 consisting of J23101-B0032-E0040-B0015 in the backbone pSB3K3
Status: ready for evaluation
Device two: BBa_J23101 + BBa_E0240, each in the backbone pSB1C3
Status: cloning before evaluation
Device three: BBa_J23115 + BBa_E0240, each in the backbone pSB1C3
Status: cloning before evaluation
The cloning:
Devices two and three were built from their individual parts. The plasmids containing the promotors (BBa_J23101 and BBa_J23115) were cut open with SpeI-HF and PstI-HF restriction enzymes. The XbaI and PstI-HF digested GFP (BBa_E0240) was then ligated downstream of the promotors. Both devices were transformed into DH5α, plated out on chloramphenicol [35mg/µl] LB-agar plates and tested via colony-PCR to identify positive clones. For verification PCR-positive clones were sequenced: device two and device three
Flow cytometry analysis:
For each measurement 50 µl of an overnight culture were first incubated with 1 µl of the membrane stain FM4-64 (final concentration: 4ng/µl) at 37°C for 60 minutes. This is necessary to differentiate between dust or cell particles and intact cells during the measurement. After the incubation, 1 µl of each sample was diluted in 200 µl phosphate buffered saline solution and then evaluated via flow cytometry. In order to generate meaningful results the described measurements were perfomed three times with technical replicates.
For the analysis, all events were gated for a signal in the red channel (which corresponds to intact cells). For those events, the gfp-fluorescence was measured in fluorescence units. The graph below shows the avarage of the geometric mean of the gfp signals from 3 experiments. The empty DH5α strain was used as control for auto fluorescence of the cells.
For details please check our Interlab study submission: LMU-Munich Interlab form
Results:
The results indicate that the promoter BBa_K823005 shows the highest expression of GFP, followed by the device BBa_I20260 (BBa_K823005 + B0032). The lowest GFP expression was measured with the device carrying BBa_K823012.
Discussion
The results generated here show a 10-fold higher expression read out with GFP for BBa_K823005 compared to BBa_K823012 . Having a closer look at the BBa_I20260 device, the utilization of the low to medium-copy plasmid pSB3K3 explains the lower expression of GFP compared to BBa_K823005 , despite containing the same insert.
Outlook
The LMU-iGEM team is looking forward to the presentation of iGEM HQ results, where we hope to see a mixture of different methods utilized - hopefully with similar outcomes.  We are curious how the absolute and relative results might differ; this might be a milestone towards ensuring reproducibility of scientific data produced by a huge number of different labs and methods.
Collaboration with Team Groningen
On August 1st, not only the collaboration with the Rathenau Instituut but also the cooperation with iGEM Team Groningen , was kicked off. During the first group chat with the Rathenau Institute, we were introduced to members of the iGEM Team Groningen that had with their 'Lacto Aid' a quite similar project idea to our BaKillus. As we pursue the same idea but work with different chassis, different targets and aim for different applications, we decided not to see them as rivals but rather use that chance to learn from their experiences and also support them, when help is required. From then on, we held regular Skype meetings and supported each other by exchanging views and thoughts about the feasibility and social desirability of our applications inspired by the guidelines of the Rathenau scenarios. Encouraged by this first steps, we also helped each other out in the lab.
Efforts of team Groningen
As our BaKillus targets Staphylococcus aureus, but we do not have access to S2 laboratories, and thus unfortunately cannot experiment with this bacterium. Our collaboration partner kindly provided us help by testing the subtilin producer Bacillus subtilis ATCC6633 in a spot-on-lawn assay on different S. aureus strains, including MRSA. Fortunately, the results could prove subtilin has inhibitory impact on S.aureus and thus, serves as excellent killing strategy for our project.
Fig. 1. Spot-on-lawn assay with the subtilin producer on three different S. aureus lawns
The results are part of our killing subproject and can be seen here or detailed information downloaded here .
Work done in our Lab
On Monday 13th of October we received parts to be evaluated in Bacillus subtilis from the iGEM Team Groningen. The goal was to evaluate Promoters fused to a super-folded Green Fluorescent Protein (sfGFP)  towards their activity in B. subtilis . In order to do so we had to bring the BioBricks into our integrative BioBrick compatible backbone pSB1C . The final analysis was done using fluorescent-activated cell sorting ( FACS ). The results of the strains carrying the Promoter-sfGFP insertion were compared to the B. subtilis W168 strain.
The following Promoters were analyzed: CP1 , CP11 , CP29 , CP30 , CP41 , CP44
The data achieved via FACS shows no change in distribution of FL1-A intensity. This strongly inidcates, that the promoter-sfGFP constructs are not active when integrated into the B. subtilis chromosome. This might however be not only due to an lack of Promoter activity. To further invesitgate a quantitative assay using promoter-lux fusions should be carried out.

A proposal of the German iGEM Teams concerning Intellectual Property
During the meetup of the German iGEM teams from 23rd to 25th May a workshop also took place in which amongst others we discussed the topic of bioethics. Moral questions were addressed, regarding the value of life and human influence on it, as well as questions dealing with the possible socioeconomic effects of synthetic biology.
Especially the topic of an open source vs. patent controlled field accounted for a large part of the discussion. During the discussion one student brought up the point that the legal status of parts in the parts registry remains unclear and that there are parts (e.g. BBa_K180009 ) where it only becomes clear upon a closer that the rights are company–owned. This issue (that the legal status of parts in the registry remains uncertain) is also mentioned in a recent article published by Nature [1]:
""[N]o one can say with any certainty how many of these parts are themselves entirely free of patent claims.""
We, the German iGEM teams, therefore like to suggest the addition of a new feature to the parts registry:
A dedicated data field of license information for each BioBrick part.
For the implementation, we propose to introduce two new fields to the BioBrick part entries in the registry:
A string property ""LicenseInfo""
A traffic light property (grey, green, yellow, red) to indicate the level of legal protection (unknown, BPA-like, free for research purposes, heavily protected)
Implementing this feature would in our opinion further clarify and extend the parts info, provide a machine-readable format and thus improve future entries. With the emerging Entrepreneurship track and applications getting closer to industrial realization, the legal status becomes more and more relevant. It would also raise awareness to the topic of the legal status of parts. This could lead to a debate which could further promote the idea of open source, ideally. At the same time we hope that the examination of most parts will show that they are indeed free of restrictive legal protections.

iGEM Team attributions page
Each team must clearly attribute work done by the student team members on this page.  The team must distinguish work done by the students from work done by others, including the host labs, advisors, instructors, and individuals not on the team roster.
Why do we have this requirement?
Attribution Template
We have this requirement to help the judges know what you did yourselves and what you had help with. We don't mind if you get help with difficult or complex techniques, just be sure to report the work your team did and the work that was done by others.
For example, you might choose to work with an animal model during your project. Working with animals requires getting a license and applying far in advance to conduct certain experiments in many countries. This is something that is difficult to achieve during the course of a summer, but much easier if you can work with a postdoc or PI who has the right licenses.
A great example of complete attribution comes from the Imperial College London 2011 team (scroll down to the bottom of their team page to see attributions).
Here are some of the fields we recommend you have on this page. If there are other areas not listed below, but applicable to your team/project, please feel free to also list them on your attributions page. Please feel free to remove any areas not applicable to your project.

General Support
Dr. Howard Salis and Dr. Tom Richard were our iGEM coordinators and were instrumental in development of the big ideas for our projects as well as with troubleshooting specific experiments.
Project Support and Advice
Chiam Yu Ng (graduate student) was an outstanding mentor, helping us to learn design strategies and develop a cloning plan to set our project into motion. When we ran into problems with cloning, Chiam Yu was very patient and helped us to optimize our experimental processes.
Another great asset to our project was Tian Tian (graduate student). Because of her desk’s proximity to Clay’s, she skillfully answered an almost constant stream of questions - on everything from optimizing PCR protocols to tips for plasmid prep.
Manish Kushwaha (post-doc), Iman Farasat (graduate student), Long Chen (graduate student) and Amin Espah Borujeni (graduate student) all provided critical tips for improving our cloning strategy, as well as assistance developing our programs to optimize the GFPs.
Iman Farasat and Dr. Salis were a big help to the Biodetoxification project. Iman assisted us with forming an experimental plan and ordering primers for Gibson Chew-Back Annealing Assembly. They both taught us how to perform a CBA and homologous recombination and offered advice during our project troubleshooting. Tian Tian, Chiam Yu Ng, Long Chen, Manish Kushwaha and Amin Espah Borujeni answered our random questions.
Fundraising Help and Advice
Dr. Tom Richard and Dr. Howard Salis took on the burden of finding funding for the undergrads, and we are sincerely thankful for their work.
Lab Support
We are very appreciative of being able to use Dr. Salis’s Lab space and materials. Iman and Chiam Yu were crucial in the wet-lab success of both projects.
Difficult Technique Support
When we experienced problems with a tricky inverse PCR, Chiam Yu helped us to uncover a critical error in one of our primers. Designing an RBS library with the constraints that were present in our constructs was very difficult and Iman helped us to understand and solve this problem.  Iman taught the Biodetoxification group the protocol for Gibson CBA and homologous recombination. Dr. Salis provided modifications to the protocol using the Lambda Red Recombinase plasmid.
Wiki Support
Chiam Yu was helpful with advice. Ashlee spent a lot of time surfing the internet and found tutorials and resources for html and CSS. None of us have experience with creating a website prior to iGEM so it was quite a daunting task.
Presentation Coaching
Dr. Howard Salis and Dr. Tom Richard both improved our presentation skills.
Kay Dimarco (staff) helped us to find activity kits from the previous iGEM team, which we ended up reinventing but were a source of inspiration for our presentation to the science teachers and the ScienceU students. Matt Johnson (staff) and Leah Bug (staff) gave us advice on our NewBio Teachers presentation for the Center for Science and the Schools.
Policy and Practices Support
Dr. Tom Richard helped us to refine and implement our ideas for human practices topics.
Thanks and Acknowledgements
Thank you to everyone in the Salis lab, Dr. Salis, and Dr. Richard for supporting us along the way.

Rico Ballman
Age: 21
Studies: B.Sc. Biomolecular Engineering
Hi! This is my first time at the iGEM team. I participate because I want to make some practical lab experience beside the normal labrotaries. Also I like the idea of working in a project so interdisciplinary as this. You can share your ideas with people from other backgrounds and include their point of view into your project.I hope for new impressions in the field of synthetic biology and I'm courius about a good time in the lab.
Sebastian Barthel
Age: 22 
Subject: B. Sc. Biomolecular Engineering
During my first semester at university, I have been in contact with the former iGEM team 2012 for the first time. Since then, I was keen to work on such a interesting project like the digestion of PET by E.coli. Unfortunately I had to learn some biological basics first, so I could not help our team in 2013. But now I am even more excited to compete with our anthocyanin project this year.
I anticipate from the iGEM project to deepen my previously obtained knowledge by working independently in the laboratory and to improve my softskills and expertise. The possibilities to take positive influence on manhood's future life by using synthetic biology are enormous. I am glad to promote improvement in the field of synthetic biology by being a member of our team and by being part of this year's competition. 
Malte Blumenroth
Age: 24
Studies: M.Sc. Molecular Engineering
It's my second time to participate as part of the TU Darmstadt iGEM team after 2012.
I like the innovative nature of the competition that offers ways to improve my skills and learn about synthetic biology outside of university courses. Also I expect to get further practical experience working for a more independent project and have a good time at the lab.
Thomas Dohmen
Age: 24
Study: B.Sc. biology
After hearing a lot about the last iGEM projects at the TU Darmstadt, I absolutely wanted to join. I like the idea of working in a research group for which iGEM offers the first opportunity.
I am looking forward to gain practical experience, especially since one normally does not get the chance to do so during the regular study.
To meet other people, to exchange ideas and get in contact with economy, thats the spirit of iGEM.
Because of that, I am really excited to participate on this years iGEM competition and I am also really looking forward to see you guys on the Giant Jamboree in Boston!
Maximilian Dombrowsky
Age: 23
Study: B.Sc. Biomoleculare Engineering
My name is Maximilian Dombrowsky and I am studying Biomoleculare Engineering at TU Darmstadt. I first heard about iGEM from some fellow students and despite a lack of time, I participated this year because I liked the idea of working on an students only project. Through iGEM I hope to get a new insight in synthetic biology, laboratory work and design of experiments.
Kai Fenzl
Age: 22
Study field: B. Sc. Biomolecular Engineering
After my first time in the TU Darmstadt's iGEM team I had a lot of fun and I want to take part also in this year. I like to increas my abilities from last iGEM 2013 and I hope that I can learn new thinks, also from other field of science. I am excited to test my abilities and I hope that the iGEM-Team 2014 is  again a pleasant and constructive working group, like last year.
Tobias Gabriel
Age: 24
Studies: M.Sc. Biology
During by bachelor studies I already heard about the creative iGEM projects of the TU Darmstadt. Therefore, I am pleased to join the iGEM competition for the first time in 2014 during my master studies. I am fascinated by the iGEM projects due to the teamwork with highly motivated and creative fellow students that meet die challenge to realize a science project independently. Additionally, the broad range of tasks of the iGEM project always leads to the opportunity to acquire new knowledge and to deepen already existing skills.
Sascha Hein
Age: 23
Studies: M.Sc. Biomolecular Engineering
I absolved my education as biological technical assistent in 2010. Now I'm in my sixth semester biomolecular engineering at the TU Darmtstadt. The first time I heard about the iGEM competition was in 2009 and since then I'm fascinated by the fundamental idea of this project. I'm looking forward to an interesting summer and to learn a lot about synthetic biology. Beside a sucessful participation I hope to establish international contacts.  
Niklas Hummel
Age: 22
Subject: Biomolecular Engineering
Hello,
my name is Niklas, I am 22 years old and I am studying Biomolecular Engineering at the TU Darmstadt in my second year. I joined the iGEM-team, because I want to work with young scientists on an interesting topic in a fast developing market. I think our sector has one of the biggest potencials in our century and I want to learn the tools to help develop it. I am looking forward to work in a constructive and creative atmosphere with a qualified team.
Carmen Klein
Age: 24
M. Sc. Biomolecular Engineering
Taking part the second time in the TU Darmstadt's iGEM team, I'm looking forward to an interesting project period. Both, new experiences and new challenges are on our way on which we provide our personal skills for a freshly planned work. Again, our team members contain students with a variety of knowledge and levels who hopefully will complement and support one another.
Kai Kucharzewski 
Age: 22 
Studies: M. Sc. technical biology
Hi! I’m Kai. After finishing my bachelor studies of biophysics in Frankfurt, I switched for my master studies to technical biology to get a focus on biotechnology approaches. I’m looking forward to challenges and having fun during my first time at iGEM.
Benjamin Mayer
Age: 26
Studies: B.Sc. computer science, M.Sc. physics
Hi, my name is Benjamin Mayer, I am currently studying at the TU Darmstadt for my bachelor's degree in computer science and my master's degree in physics.
I initially learned about iGEM during my bachelor thesis at the Computational Biology and Simulation group.
As physicist and computer scientist I am equipped with a relatively broad theoretical knowledge from which I want to contribute to the Team, e.g., in the field of modeling.For me personally iGEM is a chance to work with a large Team, in comparison to the group sizes common for my field of study, on an interesting and multidisciplinary subject. Thus, through iGEM I can broaden my scope of knowledge and learn new team competences.
Christian Mende
Age: 26
Study: B.Sc. Biotechnology
I pay attention on iGEM because of a documantation of syntetic biology which aroused my interest.The more I informed me, the more I wanted to take a part of it.By chance I met the right person and I could not miss this opportunity.Now i am glad to transform the theory of lectures into practice to collect important experiences 
Laurin Monnheimer
Age:24
Study: B.Sc. Biology
Participating  iGEM the second time i've get once more the bargain being part of this project.
The contest offers the unique opportunity to carry out research in a practically oriented manner and to meet scientific challenges as a team. Therefore, iGEM presents an outstanding occasion to gain new valuable experiences and to further develop my personal and scientific skills.  
I hope that we as a project team will be successful in finding solid solutions to the problems we will be confronted with and I am highly motivated to make my personal contribution to iGEM. 
Sebastian Palluk
Age: 25 
Subject: M.Sc Technical Biology, 2. semester 
I took part in the first iGEM participation of the TU Darmstadt two years ago and I am looking forward to another challenging year of participating in the competition. I like working with students from multiple disciplines and the freedom and opportunity to try out diverse ideas in the lab. The fascinating projects that are performed every year give an impression of how much knowledge a student can gain by competing at iGEM. I specialized on computational biology during my bachelor studies and I am looking forward to employing those skills for my team.
Sven Rumpf
Age: 24
Studies: M.Sc. Chemistry
This is my third time in the iGEM team but nevertheless I'm still excited like I was in the first year. Contrary to regular modules iGEM gives you th opportunity to deepen your knowledge in themes aside my study program. I hope for a good colaboration in the team and a great time in the lab.  
Fabian Rohden
Age: 23
Studies: B.Sc. Biology
Hello! My name is Fabian Rohden and I study Biology in the fifth semester.I heard about iGEM from some Biomoleculer Engineering students and really liked the idea of working on an interesting project in addition to the normal university studies. Through iGEM I hope to learn a lot about synthetic biology but also about the organization of science projects. 
Daniel Sachs
Age: 25
Study: M. Sc. Biomolecular Engineering
It’s already the third iGEM competition for me and since it may be the last (as a student), I’m already a bit melancholic. Nevertheless the upcoming “Giant Jamboree” in Boston motivates me even more to put as much effort as possible in our project to make it the best TU Darmstadt iGEM ever!
Renè Sahm
Age: 24
Study: M.Sc. Biomolecular Engineering, 2. semester
In 2012 I were already of the party with our first participation in the iGEM-competition. It was an unique experience and I had a lot of fun at that time. After my pause in the competition last year, I am now ready to lend a hand again. Until now I've passed my B.Sc. Biomolecular Engineering at the TU Darmstadt and started my master's degree with a specialization in structural biology. So I hope I'll be able to support my team optimally and to contribute it with some useful results in bioinformatics. Like the last time I am looking forward to the competition and the other participant student-teams. In particular, I am very curious because of the speciality that the whole competition will proceed at the MIT this year.
Christian Sator
Age: 26
Studies: M.Sc. Biomolecular Engineering
I joined this year’s iGEM-team because I like the idea of tackling a complex issue together with a team and work out solutions for it. I think iGEM is a great opportunity to experience independent and interdisciplinary research and to broaden one’s mind. I’m looking forward to learn new stuff and meet lots of interesting people.
Andreas Schmidt
Age: 27
Studies: M.Sc. Molecular Engineering
My Name is Andreas Schmidt and I'm really excited about this years iGEM competition. This is not my first time in iGEM but now I'm one of the veterans who has to lead the younger ones. I expect this to be even more challenging than being a newcomer but I appreciate this new experience.   
Christian Sürder
Age: 28
Studies: M.Sc. Physik
I'm an experimantal physicist at the department of nuclear physics. But I also work as trainee for the university. Together with my brother we attentand this years iGEM-Project. We suppport in team in terms of project coordination, präsentation and teamwork. I'm very excited about the cooperation and the interdisciplinary challenges.
Michael Sürder
Age: 26
Studies: M.Sc. Technical Biology
Altough I study biology my work in this team is being a coach for communication, presentation and project attendance.
Normally I support IT and economy projects so I'm very excited about attending a natural science project. I hope me and my brother can help to optimize the organisation and the teamwork of the group.  
Bastian Wagner
Age:24
Studies: B. Sc. Biomolecular Engineering
Hi, my name is Bastian Wagner and I am a student of the bachelor program Biomolecular Engineering at the TU Darmstadt. I participate in iGEM, because I like to support the Registry of Standard Biological Parts and learn new things about constructing biological systems. 
Alex Wyllie
Age: 24
Studies: M. Sc. Biomolecular Engineering
Hey guys, I am a team member of the sub-group public relations. I was responsible for the project „iGEM TU Darmstadt crowdfunding“. The strategic development and behind this project was a big challenge since we had high aims: We wanted to become the first crowd funded team at the TU Darmstadt. This year was special and I’m really thankful to have worked with such highly motivated fellow-students and friends.
Instructors
Prof. Dr. Heribert Warzecha

Sven Jager
Studies: Ph.D. Biomolecular Engineering
Hello! As you can see I'm doing my PhD. I'm an oldtimer and therefore can't participate as a normal team member like I did before. So this year I work as an advisor for the team. My job is to be the mediator for frictions inside between team members. As I'm residing in the field of computational biology I'm also an advisor for the modelling group of our team.I hope I can help the team with my experience and inspire the younger students for the field of bioinformatics.

iGEM Team attributions page
Each team must clearly attribute work done by the student team members on this page.  The team must distinguish work done by the students from work done by others, including the host labs, advisors, instructors, and individuals not on the team roster.
Why do we have this requirement?
Attribution Template
We have this requirement to help the judges know what you did yourselves and what you had help with. We don't mind if you get help with difficult or complex techniques, just be sure to report the work your team did and the work that was done by others.
For example, you might choose to work with an animal model during your project. Working with animals requires getting a license and applying far in advance to conduct certain experiments in many countries. This is something that is difficult to achieve during the course of a summer, but much easier if you can work with a postdoc or PI who has the right licenses.
A great example of complete attribution comes from the Imperial College London 2011 team (scroll down to the bottom of their team page to see attributions).
Here are some of the fields we recommend you have on this page. If there are other areas not listed below, but applicable to your team/project, please feel free to also list them on your attributions page. Please feel free to remove any areas not applicable to your project.

iGEM Team attributions page
Each team must clearly attribute work done by the student team members on this page.  The team must distinguish work done by the students from work done by others, including the host labs, advisors, instructors, and individuals not on the team roster.
Why do we have this requirement?
Attribution Template
We have this requirement to help the judges know what you did yourselves and what you had help with. We don't mind if you get help with difficult or complex techniques, just be sure to report the work your team did and the work that was done by others.
For example, you might choose to work with an animal model during your project. Working with animals requires getting a license and applying far in advance to conduct certain experiments in many countries. This is something that is difficult to achieve during the course of a summer, but much easier if you can work with a postdoc or PI who has the right licenses.
A great example of complete attribution comes from the Imperial College London 2011 team (scroll down to the bottom of their team page to see attributions).
Here are some of the fields we recommend you have on this page. If there are other areas not listed below, but applicable to your team/project, please feel free to also list them on your attributions page. Please feel free to remove any areas not applicable to your project.

one of the core member of 2014 SZU-iGEM.She is a  very cute girl .She is also an important researcher that she participated in every step of the project.
Huan Wei
I’m a  Junior student at the Shenzhen University , very glad to participate in 2014-IGEM. This summer, IGEM brings us not only a synthetic biology knowledge, the more important thing is the team cooperation ability. We have a headache for the failure of the experiment over and over again, and cheered for every step of the experiment a success. Because of IGEM, we learned too much. We fully enjoy the whole summer.
BigStone(Heng Shi)
I am a senior student. This is my first time to attend IGEM. I am responsible for experiment operates parts. In this activity, I learned how to build a team, how to start IGEM, The project had been difficult and tedious, and members of my team had stayed at the laboratory until midnight each night for weeks to finish Experiment. I believe that my team will be better and better.
Zeyu Miao
I am a junior student majoring in Life Sciences in SZU. I am interested in life science. I always believe that one will easily lag behind unless he keeps on learning, therefore I would like to continue my study in this field. Work independently, mature and resourceful are my style, of course, I will responsible and diligent in any project I undertake through my hardworking. Whatever is worth doing is worth doing well. I have been ready to accept the challenge and I come here to fulfill myself.
Solar (Zirui Yue)
I’m so honored to participate in 2014 iGEM competition. This game gives me a chance to contact with Synthesis Biology and many different competitors, including schoolmates come from different grade and people come from other universities. Actually doing biological experiments is so cool. I had attended a small group to establish Suicide Part and then converted to design Wiki Web of our whole project.
Angleo (Zhao Shangguan)
Where there is a will ,there is a way.
Kee (Qi Li)
Keep on going never give up.
Yongyi Wang
My name is Wang Yongyi.I am a junior student from shenzhen university college of life science. Others call me the yongyiguagua! I am a experimenter in SZU - iGEM team and I am mainly responsible for the progress of the experiment and data processing. I also go through the photoshop, edit pictures, etc at my free time. I like outdoor activities, like to play golf and swimming. My swimming technology is not so  excellent, but I enjoy it like doing the experiment.
Jenny(Lin Zhang)
I am very glad to join the game of IGEM in last few months. I gain lots of fun in the process of the game and I made many new friends from the game. We were always work together in the lab from morning to night. Even very tired but we find pleasure in it. Because of game we need a lot of knowledge of molecular biology, so we spent so much time to search the knowledge of molecular and learn how to design a experiment. At last we let our knowledge bank abundantly. In the game, I am in charge of the part of promoter, we need to gain the P43 promoter from bacillus subtilis and guide into escherichia coli. In the process we faced many times of failure, but through our attempted we found way to solve the problem at last.
Monica (Yating Wan)
I’m member of suicide team. The aims of our team that bacterial will be dead as our willingness. We cut gene segment of Ccdb out and linked it after promoter. Finally, if we put IPTG ,the bacterial will be dead.  get through this competition I not only improve my ability of cooperate with others but also learn about Molecular Biology and elementary operation.In a word, IGEM is a fantastic competition.
Steven (Diwen Shi)
Hello! My name is Steven. In this project, I was a member in web design. Writing details, such as overview, abstract and design, was my job. During the process, not only my English but my computer skills have improved a lot. The experience in iGEM left a deep impression on me.
Jierui Chen
Do one thing at a time, and do well.
Yuanyuan Xu
I am Yuanyuan Xu,a junior from Shenzhen University majoring in Life Science.  I am fond of traveling and reading .Traveling is a wonderful way to broaden our horizons and experience different culture. And we can learn how to face up with difficulties and how to live a meaningful life by reading. Taking part in iGEM, I understand the significant of cooperation, which is crucial to success of the whole project. Additionally, a correct direction plays an important role in the process. More importantly, I gradually have courage to deal with barriers. As the saying goes, where there is a will, there is a way.
Atseway (Wei Xie)
It was really unforgettable and worthwhile spending  one year to finish our projects with my team,SZU-iGem.This term ,I become a junior student and major in Biology Science.Interested in synthetic biology but knowing little about it,I decided to study synthetic biology and now I’m fascinated in it deeply.I participated in establishing KIL part and MDFA part which were key structures in our projects during the whole summer holiday in 2014.Meanwhile I contacted iGem team of South University of S(SUSTC),we held a meeting to share ideas and experience on iGem,which I learned a lot from them.Anyway,there is no end of studying synthetic biology .I’m pround of our team cooperation and always want to be the one who is ready to take challenge and and find incredible joy in the next coming process.

iGEM Profile
Eleanor Amidei is a recent graduate of ALHS and is heading to UC Berkeley in the spring studying whatever undecided students study -- possibly molecular cell biology or maybe political science, but leaning towards public health. Most nights, after hours spent in the lab, you can find Eleanor in the weight room at ALHS working out and contemplating the myriad of reasons she decided to forgo sleep the night before (thanks, Netflix), only to give into the temptation again. While sometimes wishing she were already in school, iGEM has been an invaluable educational experience.
Sabrina Chu aka 'greatest driver on earth' is a recent graduate from Abraham Lincoln High School who is attending UC Davis as a freshman in the fall. She plans to major in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology. She also plans on minoring in accounting and is very excited to finally attend college. She gained much of her wetlab experience during high school in her Biotechnology class at Abraham Lincoln High School in San Francisco. Because of her many hours using the FACS machine, she is also known as the ""Flow Master.""
Shuaixin He will be in her third year at Peking University. She majors in Life Sciences and is interested in observing and thinking about biological phenomena at microcosmic level. She was a lab manager for the 2013 Peking iGEM team and this is her second time participating in iGEM. In this year's project, she managed the strain construction and characterization of positive & negative feedback.  She has really enjoyed a pleasant time with S. cerevisiae as well as her fellow teammates.
Jessica Hsueh is a third year bioengineering major at UC Berkeley. She is from Fremont, California, which means she enjoys an hour and a half commute from home to the lab in San Francisco. Jessica likes learning about a variety of topics, from working with yeast to programming Kilobots. Outside of research and academics, Jessica also enjoys good food, books, movies, puzzles, Quidditch, and archery.
Derrick Lee is currently a sophomore at City College of San Francisco, majoring in Molecular Cell Biology. He intends to transfer to either UC Davis or UC Berkeley and eventually pursue a PhD. This is his second year as a member of the UCSF-UCB iGEM Team and he is an Abraham Lincoln High School alumnus. In his off-time, Derrick enjoys binge-watching TV shows, rooting for the Golden State Warriors and the San Francisco 49ers, and finding the best places to eat in San Francisco. He also has a somewhat unhealthy attachment to the Internet.
Jeffrey Shu, a recent graduate from Abraham Lincoln High School, is currently studying as a freshman at UC Berkeley and intending to major in Molecular and Cell Biology. Jeffrey was drawn to iGEM for its innovative approach to collaborative science and its exciting opportunity to try new things. When not in the lab, you can find him cleaning and organizing things, curling up reading a good book, obsessively binge-watching shows and movies on his bucket list, or loudly singing show tunes in the shower. Jeffrey is excited to start his new life in college and be a part of such an exciting scientific venture alongside his amazing teammates.
Eric Wong is a second year student with the UCSF-UCB iGEM team.  Like many of his teammates, he is also an Abraham Lincoln High School alumnus.  Eric currently attends the College of San Mateo and is interested in transferring to either UC-Berkeley or UC-Davis to study Molecular Cell Biology. iGEM gave him the opportunity to dive straight into hands-on, innovative research that he would otherwise not have been able to do. He feels that it has been a pleasure to be a part of this enormous community where people all work together to discover and create things we never imagined or thought possible.
Robert Wong is a recent graduate from Abraham Lincoln High School and is currently at College of San Mateo.  He plans to move onto UC Davis or UC Berkeley after finishing his GEs at CSM.  Right now he’s headed in the direction of Molecular Cell Biology as a major and hopes to eventually earn his PhD.  In his free time he likes to find good food places. “I'M A BIG FOODIE!”
Ianto Lin Xi is a fourth year undergraduate student at UC Berkeley studying Molecular and Cell Biology with an emphasis in immunology. Outside of iGEM, Ianto works at the Children’s Hospital Oakland Research Institute, where he can be found programming pipelines to analyze sequencing data. He is also a coordinator at the Berkeley Free Clinic, where he manages the routine operations of the Men’s STI Clinic. In his free time, Ianto forgoes the stability of the earth and prefers to dangle dangerously from rocks.
Born and raised as a 2nd generation immigrant, George Yip has adopted both Chinese and American cultures. He is a recent graduate of Abraham Lincoln High School and has his road paved towards CSM. The idea of learning and gathering knowledge was an essential motivator for him to join iGEM. Real world experience and the trials of everyday scientists are seldom found in literature, and George is certain that being a participant in the world of science will further reinforce his understanding of this field as well as open up insights for him to investigate.

This is Kara Helmke’s second year working with the iGEM team. She just completed her graduate work at UC Berkeley studying mitosis in frogs. As a cell biologist and microscopist by training, the field of synthetic biology has been both challenging and exciting for her to learn about alongside the students.
Wendell Lim has had a lab at UCSF for over 15 years and has been an adviser to the UCSF team since it started in 2007. He enjoys working with bright, open-minded young scientists and seeing their ideas develop into scientific projects.
Hyun Youk is a former postdoc in the Lim Lab and now an assistant professor of physics and nanobiology at the Delft University of Technology, currently setting up his new lab. His main passion is seeking core mathematical/physical principles that govern dynamics of biological systems, such as genetic circuits and multicellular entities. Among his many responsibilities, one that particularly excites him is learning from and mentoring young students as they embark on their research careers.
Mentors
Michael Broeker is a Junior Specialist with UCSF’s Center for Systems & Synthetic Biology, as well as a practicing sculptor. He is a specialist in feeder-free, serum-free stem cell culture, and is currently helping Post-docs realize a project that uses the CRISPRi system in mammalian cells.
Kevin Hartman is a second year Bioinformatics PhD student at UCSF. He received his Bachelor’s degree from the California Institute of Technology in Chemical Engineering. Following that, he worked in the biofuels industry for two years. He helped the iGEM team develop data analysis computational tools.
Zairan Liu is a second year graduate student at University of California, San Francisco. She is part of the integrated program of quantitative biology (iPQB) and just joined the Weiner lab. With interest in systems and synthetic biology, she wants to study development of early zebrafish embryos using optogenetic tools.
Leonardo Morsut is a postdoctoral fellow in Wendell Lim Lab at UCSF where he is developing new synthetic biology tools to control mammalian cell-cell communication and behavior. He is fascinated by the enthusiasm that the iGEM teams bring to the lab each year and happy to witness their original contributions to research.
Anusuya Ramasubramanian is a fourth year Bioengineering Ph.D. student in the UCSF/UC Berkeley joint program, where she works at the nexus of tissue engineering, biomaterials and synthetic biology. She has an undergraduate degree in Biomechanical Engineering from Stanford University. Having participated in iGEM twice as an undergrad at Stanford - once as team member and once as a mentor - she couldn't help but get involved with iGEM as a graduate student.  This is Anusuya's second year mentoring the UCSF iGEM team.  Mentoring this team, which has a unique mix of high school and undergraduate members, has been an incredibly enriching and rewarding experience. Anusuya has been really impressed with the progress of this year's team and can't wait to see the impact of their work at the Jamboree and beyond!

iGEM Profile
Throughout the entire summer, each student had specific jobs that contributed to our project. In order to accomplish our goals, the individual students all came together to work as a team. We took inspiration for this year’s project from prior work done by our mentors (Youk and Lim, 2014) and we set out to  engineer multiple autocrine/paracrine extracellular signaling circuits to reshape collective cell responses. To manage progress, the team attended group meetings to present a weekly update to both students and mentors on individual progress. Throughout the entire summer, each student had specific jobs that contributed to our project. In order to accomplish our goals, the individual students all came together to work as a team.
In addition to scientific research, the team participated in many collaborations with other teams and worked together to develop a human practices project geared towards educating the general public about synthetic biology, with potential expansion to school curricula.
Eleanor Amidei was one of the team leaders for Human Practices. She helped develop the proposal for and execution of our presentation at the Exploratorium. Additionally, Eleanor was in charge of construction of our parts to be sent to the Parts Registry. She has had her hand in almost everything done in the wetlab and has been instrumental in the continuation of final testing before the Jamboree. Eleanor will also represent the team by presenting at the Jamboree.
Sabrina Chu constructed the positive-feedback circuits containing alpha factor-responsive promoters driving rtTA expression (with Jessica Hsueh), which involved many rounds of troubleshooting and optimization. In the second half of the summer, she has lead circuit characterization through flow cytometry. Sabrina (along with Jeffrey Shu) has also been in charge of documentation and has completed the safety forms for the competition.
Shuaixin He worked on incorporating various methods of positive and negative feedback into our communication circuits. She created constructs with alpha-factor responsive promoters driving additional alpha factor production (positive-feedback) and worked on cloning the protease Bar1 as a means of negative feedback.
Jessica Hsueh constructed the positive-feedback circuits containing alpha factor-responsive promoters driving rtTA expression (with Sabrina Chu).  She was also our iGEM Collaboration Captain, managing interactions with 10 teams this summer. Jessica also participated in a workshop learning to program the collective behavior robots, Kilobots, making a simulation of our communication circuits.
Derrick Lee is a returning member from the 2013 iGEM team and helped train and mentor the new students for this year’s team. He constructed many parts over the summer, including alpha factor-responsive promoters in front of GFP and Ste2 (alpha factor receptor). He led promoter characterization on the flow cytometer and assisted in data analysis/presentation. Derrick used the promoter data to characterize our parts in the iGEM Parts Registry.
Jeffrey Shu was primarily in charge of strain construction in S. cerevisiae. With George Yip, he was responsible for building multiple yeast strains containing iterations of our primary circuit (pTEF1 and its mutants driving rtTA, pTET-alpha factor, and alpha factor-responsive promoters with mCherry/BFP).  Jeffrey was also one of our Human Practices captains and worked on establishing contact with the Exploratorium and has developed a curriculum for teaching students about Biotechnology. Jeffrey (along with Sabrina Chu) has also been in charge of documentation and has completed the safety and judging forms for the competition.
Eric Wong is also a returning member from the 2013 iGEM team and helped train and mentor the new students for this year’s team. He played a primary role in gathering data for the characterization of promoters as well as data of completed circuits through flow cytometry. He also helped construct and assemble 11 alpha factor-responsive promoters and rtTA. Eric also integrated several motifs of the constitutive promoter circuit into our yeast cell lines.  In addition, he also helped create the slideshow presentation displayed at the Exploratorium event for our Human Practices.
Robert Wong mainly worked in the wetlab, building several constructs: alpha factor-responsive promoters driving Ste2 or mCherry, constitutive pTEF1 promoters driving GFP, and construction of parts to submit to the Parts Registry in the pSB1C3 backbone.  Robert was also Social Media Captain (Twitter/Facebook).
Ianto Lin Xi led the initial alpha factor-responsive promoter identification and selection through literature searches. He spearheaded the characterization of these promoters through the construction of yeast strains with alpha factor-responsive promoters driving GFP. He helped set up initial flow cytometry experiments and programmed our flow cytometer data analysis and interpretation pipeline in both FlowJo and MatLab. Ianto is also in charge of our graphic design, developing our wiki and creating our poster. Ianto will also represent the team by presenting at the Jamboree.
George Yip has been primarily in charge of strain construction inS. cerevisiae. With Jeffrey Shu, he was responsible for building multiple yeast strains containing iterations of our primary circuit (pTEF1 and its mutants driving rtTA, pTET-alpha factor, and alpha factor-responsive promoters with mCherry/BFP).  As the summer has drawn to an end, George has been essential for construction of all strains required to test the remaining parts of our circuit, doing hundreds (perhaps thousands) of colony PCRs. George has also been heavily involved in testing our final circuits in flow cytometry.
Hyun Youk is a team advisor and helped with conception and execution of this project. The inspiration for the 2014 UCSF-UCB iGEM project is based on his prior work characterizing sense-and-secrete circuits in yeast (Youk and Lim, 2014), and his insight and previous constructs gave us many of the building blocks for our circuits. He was involved in every step of the project, helping to train the team in data acquisition and analysis as well as project planning and troubleshooting.
Kara Helmke is the team advisor and coordinator and has helped with planning and execution of this project. She helped the team on a day-to-day basis in training, designing experiments, interpreting results, troubleshooting, and coordinating all of the individual efforts into a team result.
Wendell Lim is the faculty advisor for the 2014 UCSF-UCB iGEM team and was involved in the conception of this year’s project, based on prior work (Youk and Lim 2014). His lab is the host for the team and he has graciously supported them with time, materials, and guidance.
The amazing group of iGEM mentors (Kevin Hartman, Jonathan Asfaha, Anusuya Ramasubramanian, Zairan Lu, Michael Broeker, Alain Bonny, Ben Heineike, PJ Buske) provided training and support to the team all summer. Many were instructors in the iGEM Bootcamp at the beginning of the summer, providing much of the valuable background and training for the execution of the project. They attended countless group meetings, helping the team not only troubleshoot the project but also hone and practice scientific communication skills. Their support also made the Human Practices event at the Exploratorium possible.

Attributions
iGEM Team attributions page
Each team must clearly attribute work done by the student team members on this page.  The team must distinguish work done by the students from work done by others, including the host labs, advisors, instructors, and individuals not on the team roster.
Why do we have this requirement?
Attribution Template
We have this requirement to help the judges know what you did yourselves and what you had help with. We don't mind if you get help with difficult or complex techniques, just be sure to report the work your team did and the work that was done by others.
For example, you might choose to work with an animal model during your project. Working with animals requires getting a license and applying far in advance to conduct certain experiments in many countries. This is something that is difficult to achieve during the course of a summer, but much easier if you can work with a postdoc or PI who has the right licenses.
A great example of complete attribution comes from the Imperial College London 2011 team (scroll down to the bottom of their team page to see attributions).
Here are some of the fields we recommend you have on this page. If there are other areas not listed below, but applicable to your team/project, please feel free to also list them on your attributions page. Please feel free to remove any areas not applicable to your project.

iGEM Japan
We attended the 86th Genetic Society of Japan and had a discussion with 8 Japanese iGEM teams (Gifu, HokkaidoU, Kyoto, Nagahama, Osaka, TMU-tokyo, Tokyo-tech, and UT-tokyo). Our topics were how iGEM Japan would be in the future and reached a consensus of our apporopriate cooperation. We had a good oppotunity to exchange information and to deepen our friendship.
Special thanks
Nobutaka Nakashima [ Lab HP ]
Department of Biological Information, Tokyo Institute of technology as an associate Professor. He offered his original vector expressing stemmed-antisense RNA and gave us some advice.
Tomohiro Tamura
Research Group of Novel Microbial Functions,  Hokkaido University as a guest professor.  We referenced his article about antisense. He was a colleague of Nakashima. He mediated between Nakashima and us, and also gave us some advice.

Rakesh Arul
Rakesh is in the second year of Chemical Engineering conjoint with Chemistry and Biology. He is interested in synthetic & systems biology and how they can be translated into improving human healthcare. He originally did undergraduate research in solid state chemistry and spectroscopy, so he is keen to learn more about biology from more experienced team members!
Olivia Fernandes
Olivia is a third year Biology and Environmental Science student. She is interested in industrial microbiology. Synthetic Biology enables her to be creative and also apply her knowledge and skills into a real world project. Outside of science, she is actively involved in parish life and community groups.
Abdirizak Warsame
Abdirizak studied biology at undergraduate level with an interest in microbiology and biochemistry. Abdirizak is always willing to learn and meet like-minded people and have accomplished both these by joining the iGEM team.
Jessica Chiang
Jessica is enthusiastic about synthetic biology and is an environmentally conscious individual. She engaged in research and designed the logo. She hopes the synthetic biology can bring in a new perspective in the manufacturing industry and will not hesitate to learn more about the link between synthetic biology and the environmental equilibrium.
Jonathan Liu
Jonathan is a third year biological science student with an interest in synthetic biology. He is in charge of the team and liaises with academic staff and sponsors.
Daniel Neuberger
Daniel is a third year biomedical student. An eager individual, he was the capable person who underwent the beaten and weathered path of securing sponsors.
Senior Staff
Professor Richard Gardner – Project supervisor
Richard Gardner played a vital part in the project, assisting us with the interpretation of the literature as well as aiding in the gene designs. His expertise and bright attitude guided the project along through the tough times.
Dr Klaus Bernd Lehnert – Project advisor
Klaus Lehnert aided us in thinking broadly about the project. To not be burden down by the complications before you have even started. His open minded approach revealed to us ways we haven’t thought of.
Mr Keith David Richards – Lab supervisor
Keith Richards, knowledgeable and skilled, taught us the essence of what it means to work in the lab and enjoy it. Patient and guiding, he helped us bring the project from paper to reality.
Dr Siouxsie Wiles – Project advisor
Siouxsie Wiles provided us with knowledge and guidance regarding the project, bringing the fears of the project not working to an end.
Emeritus Professor Dick Alfred Bellamy – Sponsorship advisor
Dick Bellamy, with his trove and knowledge and experience, showed us how to walk through the harsh environment of sponsorship with style.
We would like to thank Thermo Fischer, Auckland University school of Biological Sciences and Auckland University Faculty of Medical and Health Sciences for their sponsorship

ATTRIBUTIONS
Matthew is going into his 4th year of Life Sciences at Queen’s University. In his natural habitat, Matthew can often be found hunkered in the lab running gels between the hours of 12am-5am, the most productive time of the the day for him. Matt has often been mistaken for a K-pop star thanks to his oh-so-flippable bangs and his slim-fit denim.
Emily is going into her 3rd year of Chemical Engineering this fall. She is a very cheery individual with a love affair with culinary experiments. She dreams of riding a giant turtle across the seven seas in order to become one with the natural world.
Denisha is going into her 3rd year of Life Sciences this fall at Queen’s. Her strength is equivalent to 2 small possums, and she has sass that goes for miles. Although she is constantly frigid to the touch she has no cold tolerance whatsoever. Due to this, and her love of basking in the sun, we are confident in the fact that she is most likely cold blooded.
Rishad is going into his 4th year of Life Sciences. Aside from harassing Yuming, his other hobbies include eating a plethora of root vegetables and dazzling the team with his sleek oxfords and nautical-themed shorts. He also enjoys listening to the Pussycat dolls and pursuing fabulous hair, even though this is simply a pipe dream.
Annie recently graduated from undergraduate studies in Life Sciences and is the coolest advisor in town. Being with QGEM for the last 4 years, she is widely known for being the oldest, wisest and prettiest of the team with a dash of sass. She is an avid foodie and chronicles her foodventures in her urbanspoon-recognized blog. She owns a unicorn farm and will be studying the pharmacological properties of unicorn blood next year for her graduate degree.
Adrina is going into her 4th year of Life Sciences in the fall. She is a big fan of drinking copious amounts of tea and an aspiring poet/artist. This is her first time working with QGEM, and she’s finding it rewarding in so many ways and excited to see where the project takes her!
Yuming is going into his 3rd year of Life Sciences at Queen’s University. He has a great sense of humor and is known very fondly as “Mingerrrr” by his team members. He enjoys basking in his own masculinity and is tall, dark and handsome.
Jon is going into his 4th year of LIfe Sciences this fall. Widely known as a gentle giant, Jon spends most of his time wondering if the other team members (Denisha) will survive the night. He also finds great joy in watching sunsets and contemplating the greater meaning in life.
Matthew is going into his 3rd year of Engineering Chemistry this fall. He is renowned for his sharp jaw bone structure, which is known to cause daily traffic accidents due to astounded drivers staring at him in awe.

The members of the Modeling Group
The Uppsala Top Models have been focusing on optimizing and modeling our system through a cell-cell interaction model and a math based model on population level! These fashionista nerds are both smart and beautiful and are always able to, in the words of Tim Gun, “Make it work!”.  The modeling group consists of  one bioinformatics master student and two bachelors students.

Team quote: “Nah, let’s do it tomorrow instead, there is plenty of time”
The awesome team!
The fellowship of Colicin!
Once upon a time in the ancient capital of Sweden, a beautiful town called Uppsala. Everything was fine until the Yersinia entercolitica nation attacked. The gong gong echoed through the town! A group of brave hearts, led by three shining knights and a beautiful nerd, the fearsome Captain Redbeard with specific nukes, the glorious Viktorious with the ability to stick to anything, the very sensitive Captain Soulless with her all seeing eye  and Nils, with his computer whose dream was to be a beautiful model. The group charged towards the colony of doom. It’s over 9000 the nerd assumed! Yersinia was strong, but the group were stronger just like the nerd had predicted. For a whole summer they fought. Plans and dreams were shredded. The battle was about to be won but someone betrayed them. Tim the dark lord was a spy all along! Captain Soulless said the contamination is strong with this one! Tim tried to escape but the glorious Viktorious managed to catch his foot and he was stuck. Tim was defeated. Left stood the raging Yersinia colony, still charging against the amazing group of awesome people and Nils. Then, at eleven a’clock, the forgotten nerd no. 2, Jocke appeared and was then forgotten again. Yersinia was tho confused by this oscillating nerd. Yersinia used food posioning, it was very effective, the team was infected. However, Captain Redbeard had forgotten to eat his lunch box this day and was therefor not affected. Captain Redbeard used class two lab, it was super effective. Yersinia was weakened. Captain Redbeard fired his super specific Colicin nukes. Captain Soulless said “I sense the presence of Yersinia. They are close”. Captain Redbeard raised an eye and fired against Yersinia once more. Yersinia shivered and fell to the ground in a pile of slime. The forgotten nerd appeared from nowhere. The deed has been done, he said and disappeared again. The ancient capital Uppsala was saved! Rainbows and sparkle appeared. Everybody ran to the top of the pile of dead Yersinias and started doing the Macahoola dance! ....but somewhere, deep in the dark, new dangers were lurking.
Don’t miss part 2; The return of T.H.E.Tim!

iGEM Team attributions page
Each team must clearly attribute work done by the student team members on this page.  The team must distinguish work done by the students from work done by others, including the host labs, advisors, instructors, and individuals not on the team roster.
Why do we have this requirement?
Attribution Template
We have this requirement to help the judges know what you did yourselves and what you had help with. We don't mind if you get help with difficult or complex techniques, just be sure to report the work your team did and the work that was done by others.
For example, you might choose to work with an animal model during your project. Working with animals requires getting a license and applying far in advance to conduct certain experiments in many countries. This is something that is difficult to achieve during the course of a summer, but much easier if you can work with a postdoc or PI who has the right licenses.
A great example of complete attribution comes from the Imperial College London 2011 team (scroll down to the bottom of their team page to see attributions).
Here are some of the fields we recommend you have on this page. If there are other areas not listed below, but applicable to your team/project, please feel free to also list them on your attributions page. Please feel free to remove any areas not applicable to your project.
General Support
Project support and advice
Fundraising help and advice
Lab support
Difficult technique support
Project advisor support
Wiki support
Presentation coaching
Policy & Practices support
Thanks and acknowledgements for all other people involved in helping make a successful iGEM team.

From 2014.igem.org
About our team ( Official Team Profile )
Our team originally set in March 2013, and this year would be our first time to take participate in iGEM. Six students who are from four distinguished majors and five experienced instructors composed a compact team, and we are dedicating engineering bacteria to solve a typical graph theory mathematical problem so-called SPP-for-short. We obtained lots of happiness and inspirations from iGEM and we are really appreciate this chance to communicate with other universities and to get a deeper understanding about synthetic biology.

Self-introduction
Li Miyang: Hi, I am Li Miyang, the team leader of NUDT_china. This year is the first time for our team to participate in iGEM. As abecedarians, we encountered many difficulties, both technically and institutionally. However, with the great enthusiasm and endeavor of our group members as well as our instructors, we made progress one step at a time. And as the leader, I dedicated to organization and progression of the whole project. In every aspect, including project approval request, program refining, experimental operation and process management, together with other members, I tried my best to do a good job.
Qiu Xinyuan: Hello there, I'm Xinyuan Qiu, the originator of the team NUDT_CHINA. In our project I cover most part of the wet lab as well as the poster designing and the presentation. I also participated in the project designing  and  some other PR issues. As a bio-geek, I abhor boring life and chase after new and exciting things. That's why I'm here for the iGEM and that's also why my team can be formed and fight its way to this far in face of lots of predictable and unpredictable obstacles in NUDT. It's my great honor to have all my team members with me in iGEM 2014, and I believe that we can get what we want from It.
Zhu Qianhui: I’m Rose Zhu, a girl from Jiujiang city which is a lovely city near Poyang Lake. I have never been away from water. I enjoy dance and imagine I were a stream wiggling by the forests. Water is the best description of my personalities. I’m of a gentle and flexible nature. I can feel that under the water surface, there is secret of life calling for my exploration. Being a member of NUDT-China for IGEM, I’m excited by sharing curiosity, knowledge and ideas about biology.
Xie Nianhao: I am Nianhao Xie who have great curiosity to the unknown fields especially the secrets of life. Living in a small village made it possible for me to observe and think about the nature. I am good at painting and mathematics which enhance imaginal thinking and logic thinking. Although I am just an amateur of biology, I am inspired by grasping new knowledge and applying what I know (as an engineering student) to synthetic biology, such as modelling. I enjoy the process of brainstorming and arguing with my partners. (We are full of enthusiasm!)
Zhang Chuyuan: I’m Aloice Zhang who come from a hilly city located in the southwest of China. Living in the misty mountains, animals and plants become my friends who told imagical stories of life and shared the whole childhood with me. There is a living forest in my heart, I like reading and writing at the shadow of leaves and regard it as the discovery and expression of the inner forest. I’m interested in various culture all over the world, too. I’m eager to know more people and improve with them together.
Han Jize: My name is Jize Han，I come from Qinhuangdao Hebei China. I study in National University of Defense Technology, major in Applied Physics. .After about two years’ hard work, I have learned most of the courses of my specialty and have a good command of English. This year, I participated in China Undergraduate Physicists’ Tournament, and ranked 4 of 39 best-known universities in China. Since I was a child, I am very interested in biological, and I am looking forward to studying Biophysics in future. I'm good at logical thinking, proficient in programming, theoretical analysis and physical experiments. In this project, I am responsible for the production of human practice, by writing a Java App Android-based platform game, to promote the concept of synthetic biology.

Fundraising help and advice
We have met difficulties in the fund raising part from our colleges due to the lack of experience. Consequently, the fees of experiments was by the source of Professor Wu’s research group and our personal expenditures was partly covered by our advisers Qijun Liu and Lingyun Zhu where the rest of it was paid by ourselves.
Lab support
We conducted all of our experiments in the lab of Research Center of Biological Information of the College of Science of NUDT.
Difficult techniques support
Our lab was newly established and is short of the equipment which is able to do the nucleotide sequence screening. In light of this, we bought the sequencing service from InvitrogenTM. Our devices and systems of parts was all verified there. InvitrogenTM is also the one who provided us the prime synthesize service.
Most of our regents such as enzyme were bought from TaKaRaTM and some other bio-tech companies.
Project adviser support
In the process, we got help from our teacher Qijun Liu, Xiaomin Wu and Yunlv Zhu. They gave us precious advice and experience. And Xiaomin Wu also helped us in experiments.
Wiki support
Our wiki is established by adviser Qijun Liu and our group member Xinyuan Qiu; thanks to their proficiency in page source codes which written in HTML. Miyang Li, Niaohao Xie and Chuyuan Zhang provide relevant materials.
Presentation
At the CCiC meetup hosted by HZAU in August, Xinyuan Qiu represented our group addressing presentation about our project in front of the other teams around China. And in November, the presentation will be conducted by two or three members of our team together.
Experiment support
Almost all of experiments were conducted by students ourselves, the major contributors towards this are Xinyuan Qiu and Miyang Li, Qianhui Zhu and Nianhao Xie also did lots of work. Besides, we also connected to NJU team, Tsinghua team and WHU team requiring necessary bio-bricks and reagents before registry released kits to us. It needs to be noted that the WHU_CHINA provided us their new part BBa_K1334030 for our experiment and sent us samples of AHL. We further tested the function of the part BBa_K1334030 in our experiment(see our contribution at http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K1334030 ). Here we want to our greatest appreciation to the WHU_CHINA for their support.
Human practice support
Chuyuan Zhang, Xinyuan Qiu and Xienian Hao was dedicated to do human practice concern about a survey of lab safety among students studying related majors and, Jize Han, another member in our team who designed a game APP on the Android platform aiming to popularize synthetic biology and iGEM.
Modeling support
This part is attributed to Nianhao Xie, who is good at math modeling.

iGEM Team attributions page
Each team must clearly attribute work done by the student team members on this page.  The team must distinguish work done by the students from work done by others, including the host labs, advisors, instructors, and individuals not on the team roster.
Why do we have this requirement?
Attribution Template
We have this requirement to help the judges know what you did yourselves and what you had help with. We don't mind if you get help with difficult or complex techniques, just be sure to report the work your team did and the work that was done by others.
For example, you might choose to work with an animal model during your project. Working with animals requires getting a license and applying far in advance to conduct certain experiments in many countries. This is something that is difficult to achieve during the course of a summer, but much easier if you can work with a postdoc or PI who has the right licenses.
A great example of complete attribution comes from the Imperial College London 2011 team (scroll down to the bottom of their team page to see attributions).
Here are some of the fields we recommend you have on this page. If there are other areas not listed below, but applicable to your team/project, please feel free to also list them on your attributions page. Please feel free to remove any areas not applicable to your project.

UCSD’s iGEM team will join over 200 teams from across the country for a chance to compete for the BioBrick trophy.
UCSD’s computational iGEM team will focus on recruiting a team from a wide range of academic disciplines in order to expose students to interdisciplinary research. iGEM team members will have a chance to work closely with mentors during the summer, fostering a diverse skillset necessary for interdisciplinary fields such as Systems Biology. In addition to acquiring technical skills while working on the iGEM project, students in iGEM will also refine their presentation skills – typically iGEM students present their work in: an oral presentation at the iGEM World Jamboree, on a research poster, online wiki, and ocassionally, a submission to an academic journal. Participation in UCSD’s iGEM team will raise not only students’ confidence in their research abilities, but also their awareness of opportunities in emerging fields including Systems Biology.

Bioengineering: Bioinformatics, Mathematics
2015
Collaboration was the theme of this past spring, summer, and this fall.
We have created a computational synthetic biology tool, SBiDer, that fosters collaboration among the global synthetic biology community. SBiDer also has a potential to bridge between other fields of biology and the field of synthetic biology by enabling ontological interpretations of biochemical reactions as well as genetic interactions. Furthermore, SBiDer database can become the first universal database for the field of synthetic biology. Lastly, we have minimized the barriers for collaborative development of SBiDer by modularly engineering SBiDer on an open source platform. We encourage the global community to extend, develop, and optimize SBiDer - together.
Our team has developed SBiDer from the ground up, and my primary tasks have been the engineering of the database and the search algorithm. Development of the database and the search algorithm were daunting tasks that challenged me in many ways. Yet, I embraced the challenge. The more arduous the project became, the harder I worked. As a result, this assiduous process has provided me with a fantastic opportunity to improve my skills in computer programming, bioinformatics, and mathematical modeling. Now, I truly appreciate the value of the challenges that I faced and the priceless opportunity of this education.
Developing SBiDer codes was hard, and effectively leading a groups of people was even harder. Technical challenges not only made me a critical thinker, but also harnessed my skills as leader that ultimately made me a better scientist. In the process of interacting with my teammates, I felt a maturation of myself. I have learned to be more conscious about others’ struggles. I learned to sacrifice for others in developing the project, which is key in teamwork. I learned a lot about proper teamwork ethics. Looking back, I am surprised how much I have learned about communication, effective leadership, project development, and more. I believe these skills have made me a better scientist. Without working together, we would not have been able to develop SBiDer. SBiDer is a result of our communal effort.
I believe that science and collaboration are closely intertwined, for collaboration fundamentally advances science. I am grateful for the opportunity in developing SBiDer and working with my team: Joaquin, Jenhan, Justin, Ben, Ryan, Andreas, KP, Lauren, Valeriy, Gary, Fernando, Luyao, and Rohit. I learned tremendously from the collaboration that was coalesced with the science. And finally, we made SBiDer. The past seven months have been filled with learning opportunities, arising in unexpected manners that have led a an enjoyable and fruitful journey.
I hope the community enjoys SBiDer and can contribute to its further development.
All in all, collaboration was not only the theme of this past spring, summer, and this fall, but it will be the theme of my life.
Joaquin Reyna
4th year bioinformatics undergraduate at UCSD. He worked at the Salk Institute lab as a research assistant. His research interests include genetic diseases specifically muscular dystrophies and has strong interest using programming skills for the advancement of biological knowledge. After graduating he plans on continuing research and attending graduate school.
Bioengineering: Bioinformatics, 2015
I was excited for the start of summer 2014 for the experiences and work that would be done by our UCSD iGEM team. The focus of my work was the database creation. The initial progress of the SBiDer database included lots of learning SQL and Python for the usage in the SBiDer database creation. Although I had some programming experience in Python which helped populate the database, the creation of the database itself was not an easy task. To create just any database is easy, but what I found to be really difficult was creating a database schema that planned ahead for the SBiDer network. I had great team members and together we managed to both create a reliable schema and populated a database that helped move our project forward.
I came into iGEM expecting to learn a lot of about programming, but iGEM was also a great experience to learn teamwork. Communicating seems like a given in a team project, but that doesn’t mean that ideas are put into clear words. I learned to talk clearly with my teammates to establish tasks we had to do and how we could work together. As the project was coming to a close we really depended on one another and I learned to sit down and work out problems with people. For the future I expect UCSD iGEM teams to be able to build upon our successes and failures. Being part of iGEM this summer has encouraged me to begin a club on campus that focuses on synthetic biology, stressing programming and teamworking skills that would make future UCSD iGEM teams successful and competitive.
Valeriy Sosnovskiy
Valeriy is finishing up his bachelor in Biochemistry and Cell biology with a minor in computer science. This is Valeriy's first time participating in IGem. Valeriy has worked in two labs dealing with the mechanisms of apoptosis but his interest is to become a software developer.
Biochemistry, Computer Science, 2015
Having little experience with programming, the possibility of applying my knowledge in Biochemistry to help create an application was very appealing. The chance to improve in programming and possibly learn different coding languages definitely was the icing on the cake.
Biochemistry is something I have always been fond of, but having a chance to translate that knowledge into something that people could use and benefit from was extremely exciting. iGEM was a chance to make that happen.
During my time as a member of the UCSD Software  iGEM team, I learned many different coding languages including  html, JavaScript, Python,  and Java.  Throughout the entire development process I got a chance to work with the front-end and the back-end parts of the application development, with my primary focus being web development, as well as the user interface portion of the application. This was an enriching experience as I learned many different techniques as time went on, and now feel more comfortable as ever with the ability to design web applications in the future.  The project taught me many skills and bonded me with all my teammates, and as a result we were able to develop an application that we believe could possibly change data mining.
Lauren Crudup
Lauren Crudup is a bioengineering student at the University of California, San Diego. Lauren works in Dr. Coleman's Neural Interactions Laboratory where the purpose of her current research is to contribute to this expanding body of work related to neurological signal processing by developing a reliable testing mechanism for measuring the physiological and neurological changes associated with empathetic behavioral patterns in rats. She is also currently leading an engineering project team through Engineers Without Borders focused on determining an effective and efficient way to automate a large-scale algal media testing system. Lauren hopes to continue to develop the programming skills she has learned through the iGEM program and her other research experiences in her future career.
Bioengineering, 2015
When I applied to become part of the UCSD iGEM team, I understood that it would be a substantial challenge given my lack of knowledge about synthetic biology. As the Spring quarter progressed and we were introduced to a plethora of programming concepts, what was being asked of us as members of the iGEM team became clear. Instead of shirking at the responsibility that lay before us, everyone started the project with the enthusiasm about the task we had been given.
As we moved into summer, I had the opportunity to work on code for the search algorithm, JSON file creation, and generation of the Pigeon images as well as work on the complexity analysis. Each project has enabled me to build a strong background in programming and synthetic biology, and I hope to continue to pursue both in the future.
We have had a great opportunity to build a complex, novel application that has the ability to change the landscape of synthetic biology by allowing community collaboration. We have enabled the community to stand upon the shoulders of a SBiDer-sized giant.
Gary Le
Gary is a second year undergraduate at UC San Diego born in Milpitas, California with a strong interest in biological studies and medicine. Prior to involvement with the UCSD Software team, he had little exposure to web application development. Aiding the team in building the SBiDer web tool has given him a greater understanding of synthetic biology, and he is motivated to continue pursuing study in the new field.
Human Biology, Business, 2017
I started aboard the UCSD Software iGEM team after hearing about a project for undergraduates centering around the relatively new field of synthetic biology. The subject was one I had no practical experience with but was one that I had been avidly following since I had first heard of the term ""synthetic"" being applied to a field of biology. With no knowledge of how to program in any language and with only an introductory knowledge into genetic circuitry, I decided to apply for a chance to help in the endeavor. At first, I was both intimidated by the scope of the project planned and the skills set of my future team members and mentors, but I grew more excited and impressed the more skill I had begun to learn and concepts I started to understand. My skill set expanded rapidly in the oncoming months to include ways of analyzing problems algorithmically and constructing methods to approach a solution above the various programming languages I learned.
These skills were implemented with equal rapidity as I worked to create a user interface for the manually-curated network of synthetic genetic devices. The weeks passed before I had realized, and I felt overwhelmed at times by the material I needed to not only learn but master in order to create a viable component to the SBiDer project. However, with guidance from the graduate students and practice, I was able to implement the front-end application that was capable of rendering a visual network of the database information that could dynamically be altered and manipulated to allow users to explore connections of the database through a graphic interface. I additionally spent time learning from other team members about the nature of the genetic circuits to improve my biological foundation as well as how to manipulate and represent data in order to begin constructing a way to aid in creating models of the circuit behavior.
Like all goals worth pursuing, working with the UCSD iGEM team required many hours of difficult work and challenges to be solved. The result , however, improved my own personal ability and produced a project with a growing potential to aid a large audience of people. After the conclusion of this year's jamboree, I hope to have the pleasure to continue working with my team to create a lasting impact upon our campus by educating other undergraduates and providing them the skills to tackle an opportunity like this both in an academic setting and in other aspects of their life. I am proud of my team and our work and grateful for the many outstanding people that allowed this event to unfold.

Computer Science, 2016
This is my first year taking part in iGEM, and also my first research project as an undergraduate student. When I read about UCSD building a team to take part in iGEM, I knew wanted to be a part of the team but was apprehensive at first as I wasn’t sure if, as a Computer Science major, I’d fit into a team participating in a Synthetic ‘Biology’ competition. After meeting Jenhan for the first time, though, a lot of my fears had subsided. He eased me into the team and let me know that I didn’t require a lot of background or experience in biology as this project was meant to be a learning experience for everybody.
He couldn’t have been more right about that; we learned & picked up a ton of skills this summer, ranging from reading scientific papers, mining data, building a database based on that data to figuring out how a real world software project works. We learned about little details such as setting realistic expectations and deadlines for tasks. I personally learned a lot about what entails the field of Synthetic Biology (pro advice: reading nature journals on the topic helps with that ;).  Having worked on the website and the application that we built, I also picked up several web development skills.
Overall, taking part in iGEM 2014 and representing UCSD at an international level was a fun & highly enriching learning experience.  Over the course of the summer, we put together an awesome app with the help of our advisors. I feel proud to have been part of the team that built one of the most breathtaking Syn Bio apps this year – SbiDer. Special shout-out to all our advisors –Jenhan, Justin, Ben & Ryan for guiding us and inspiring us throughout summer. Stay  awesome, people.

I am really excited for being part of our IGEM team. When I first joined IGEM, I expected to use my programming knowledge to help the team build our project, but IGEM was a great experience to learn new things. Although I have never programmed in python, but IGEM helped us learn these necessary skills before project started. My work is to create a reliable database. Thought my work, I managed to search the materials online and learn by myself. The creation of the initial database didn’t take long, but then we realized that building a database with a robust schema is more important. Working together with my teammates, we finally find a way to populate the database. Teamwork is the next important thing I learned in IGEM. IGEM isn’t just a individual project. We can only put small pieces together with efficient communication. So I learned to working out problems with my team. Another thing I learned in IGEM is planning. We break the whole project into smaller parts and set up clear goals for each one. It helped move our project forward. For the future, I hope I can join more projects like IGEM so I can create meaningful products and also improve myself.

Biosystems, 2017
An interest in artificial intelligence coupled with a philosophical inclination developed an   affinity for the notion of consciousness, which, in turn, entertained the idea of ""biological  programming."" With this newfound interest in research, I sought to find a lab position in   biotechnology at UCSD; however, research in a DNA biotechnology lab did not suffice. Prior   to iGEM, I never considered Synthetic Biology as a potential avenue in biotechnology research.   However, after Jenhan, our team coordinator, provided me with a brief description of Synthetic   Biology, I was undoubtedly convinced that I had found my niche in research.
As our software project unfolded during the summer, I became responsible for the visualization   and analysis of our complex genetic network. Following the integration of the different genetic   circuits that we found in literature, I proceed to generate a graphical representation of our   database that conveyed the relationship between the different genetic circuits. In addition, I   performed a structural and connectivity analysis, to demonstrate the increase in potential genetic   circuits that our network can provide.
This project introduced me to the potential of Synthetic Biology, and demonstrated the   importance of engineering and computational principles in synthetic and systems biology.

Rohit is a fourth-year Bioengineering: Bioinformatics major who is interested in entering the bioinformatics or synthetic biology industry after graduation.  He has an active interest in the design and analysis of biological systems,, and hopes to continue to do DIYbio work outside of college.    He is primarily looking forward to iGEM as  a way to collaborate and work with  undergraduates who share the same interest.  Outside of academics, Rohit is the Internal Officer for the Undergraduate Bioinformatics Club (UBIC) and is an active member of the UCSD Quiz Bowl club.
Bioengineering: Bionformatics, 2015
I initially heard about iGEM through an email from the Undergraduate Bioinformatics  Club (UBIC) at UCSD, of which I am currently serving as the Internal Officer. I was looking for a  research opportunity over the summer to further gain exposure to computational biology before my  final year of college. When I first met Jenhan, I was a little taken aback to discover that most of  the team had already been involved with the competition for a few weeks, but when I heard the  scope of the project, my interest immediately grew and I was excited to be a part of UCSD's first  ever iGEM team.
At first, familiarizing myself with iGEM proved to be a greater challenge than I had  expected. I had no previous exposure to the field of synthetic biology, and because I had joined at  a later date than most of the team, I started the summer already behind everyone else's knowledge  and frequently felt lost during meetings. In addition, difficulties in finding housing in San Diego  over the summer meant that I was making an hour­long commute to meetings twice a week and  working remotely for the rest. Despite this, iGEM has been a great experience. Through this  project, I learned the Python programming language, refined gaps in my programming knowledge  base, and learned a great deal about synthetic biology theory. In particular, I focused on network  analysis and network motifs. For my part of the project, I read through literature detailing various  network motif finding algorithms and implemented one of them on our network in order to conduct  analysis and demonstrate an increase in functional genetic circuits in our network.
I definitely feel that I chose the right way to spend my summer by joining the iGEM  team. Not only have I learned a great deal about synthetic biology, a field which I previously  knew nothing about, but I have learned how to work in a large group environment, how to  collaborate on a brand new project, and how to meet tight deadlines. IGEM has provided me with  a valuable skill set which I plan to use in a hopefully long and successful career in the  bioinformatics industry.

This is my third year being involved with iGEM - previously I've been an undergraduate iGEM team member 2011 as well as a mentor in 2013 - and so I thought I was ready for anything and everything. However, iGEM at UC San Diego this year caught me by surprise. Before I get into the summer's surprises, I'd like to thank our sponsors. Without generous support from Synthetic Genomics and the San Diego Center for Systems Biology, none of this would have been possible - their support gave UCSD students a chance to experience a genuine research experience in an interdisciplinary and collaborative setting. I had an excellent summer designing the project with the undergraduates, teaching them, and working with them. I think UCSD's first iGEM team has managed to impart useful lessons to all those involved, and I'm highly hopeful a second team will follow next year.
Even as an iGEM veteran, the amount of work involved in coordinating this project and mentoring each of the students was quite unanticipated. Fortunately, I had quite a bit of help. I'd also like to thank my fellow mentors, Ben, Justin, Ryan, and Andreas, for helping out and stepping up as needed. Each one of them selflessly gave their time to give patient guidance for the undergraduates. Barry Demchak, Kei Ono, and the rest of the Cytoscape group gave us some great technical advice that really helped to make sure that the team took the most effective software development strategy. Other individuals that gave us some great advice include Jason Kreisberg and Prof. Todd Coleman. Risa Shibata and Anna Lu also deserve a lot of thanks for their invaluable help with logistics and making sure that we could fly to Boston and be at the Jamboree. So I'd guess the amount of work involved in iGEM was ultimately balanced by the amount of support we received.
As the project is finally wrapping up, I'm amazed at how much the students were able to accomplish in the past few months. Many of our students had little exposure to coding, and I'm glad that iGEM at UCSD was able to help them grow into proficient and innovative programmers. On the other side of the coin, we had a few computationally oriented students who managed to leverage synthetic biology concepts to help build a project that everyone on the team can take pride in. I think the project was very ambitious in its design, and I was definitely surprised when all the pieces finally clicked together. I think this was due in no small part to the leaders that emerged from amongst the undergraduates. Without the motivated students involved in this project, we would not have even gotten halfway through the project. Each of the students who worked hard on this project should be proud of themselves.
Overall, I'm very glad to have had an opportunity to be involved in UCSD's first ever iGEM team. iGEM is a great program, and my experience with iGEM in the past is one of the main reasons why I decided to pursue graduate studies. And I hope that I've done my small part to show students that research can be exciting, meaningful, and enjoyable.

When Jenhan first approached me about mentoring undergraduate students for a summer software project in synthetic biology, I was initially very excited at the opportunity, but at the same time I was nervous. Many of the students we recruited had very little experience programming, and our project was very ambitious. We spent the better part of the Spring quarter teaching skills to the undergraduates ranging from synthetic biology concepts, to algorithm development, to learning how to read scientific papers. I was pleased and impressed at how quickly the undergraduate students were able to pick up these new skills, and when summer arrived, we were ready to hit the ground running.
My undergraduate background was in biology and mathematics, but all of my research experience had been in bioinformatics up to this point. I had never worked on a synthetic biology project either, but after attending IWBDA 2014, I was able to learn more about the field, giving me the confidence to move forward in mentoring this group of undergraduates. Software development was also a new project style for me, so the process has also been a great learning experience for me as well. Much of my summer was spent helping the students develop and analyze algorithms to perform searches and queries across our manually-curated networks. I was also involved with the database schema development to better represent the network we were trying to present. As a member of the Trey Ideker lab at UCSD, I have spent the past year working closely with network biology and tools used in network biology, which has been important to the development of both the back-end database and the front-end application.
Additionally, as a new graduate student, I felt it was an excellent opportunity to begin sharpening my skills as a teacher and mentor to students not only on their projects but also their academic careers. I have found that I myself have a great love for teaching and lecturing, and it has truly been rewarding to see how far many of these students have come this year. This year, we have also been part of UCSD's very first iGEM team ever, which in itself, comes with a unique set of challenges. Our team did all of its own fundraising to pay for the registration costs of iGEM as well as the travel costs to Boston. Along the way, we have also pitched our team in addition to the project itself to several labs at UCSD in hopes of creating a sustainable team for years to come. However, even with these limited resources and barriers to our project's development, particularly in terms of our wet lab validation for this project, I am extremely pleased with what we've been able to accomplish this summer and I am proud to have been a part of UCSD's first iGEM team.

Advising for iGEM has been a fascinating engagement and a positive force towards my personal and professional development this summer.  I enjoyed discussing and formulating our project with the undergraduates. The novelty of their insight was exciting and fun. Their perspectives are untainted by the priors of the field and often stemmed new and exciting conversations.  Educating new students was also a great way to consolidate and confirm my understandings and preconceptions.  Revisiting details assumed in professional conversation is hard but ultimately beneficial.  I was delighted to discover several shortcomings in my current understanding of Synthetic Biology over the course of teaching this project.
I also had the opportunity to learn new skills such as database construction, normalization, maintenance and accession.  I had never managed a database before.  This posed a special challenge to advising its construction.  Learning enough to advise is certainly more difficult but ultimately very rewarding.  I had the immediate enjoyment of learning something new followed promptly by the joy of sharing my understanding with an eager audience.
It was also interesting to managing a team of this size for the first time.  There were some pitfalls and lost time in the beginning but eventually my co-advisors and I learned enough about distributed management and collaborative infrastructure--mostly google docs--to effectively manage a team of 10 undergraduates.
I realize that I saw many professional benefits in my ongoing experience with iGEM, but all professionalism aside, I really enjoyed my time teaching, learning and leading this iGEM project.

After my first discussion with the graduate students, who were just about to launch an iGEM project at UCSD, my impression was that the aims of this project were extremely ambitious. This made me very curious and I was excited to be on board. It soon fleshed out what would be the precise goal of the project and which tasks should be done. The great organization and strict planing, the regular meetings and terrific support of the undergraduate students by their mentors finally made this project an ongoing success.
During the project, everybody could learn and experience a lot of new aspects of research in diverse fields, reaching from project planing, organization, and conduction on the one side through scientific disciplines bioinformatics, database management systems, software design, interactive graph drawing, data exchange formats and standardization, and synthetic biology to communication, writing, and presentation skills on the other side. It can be assumed that this large interdisciplinary and highly collaborative team work was the first experience of this kind for the majority of students and therefore a great experience for all participants. It is remarkable that the project was always focused on the overall goal to obtain a useful product at the end rather than endlessly discussing tiny details of each aspect.
As assumed at the very beginning, this was an enormously challenging effort, but all participants made this project a success. To me, it is still amazing how all this could be achieved in this short time and while in parallel educating the undergraduate students in so many disciplines.

In this summer, I donated my efforts on helping UCSD iGEM team to set up a new modeling format which modularized devices as individual function and standardized the function’s structure. Based on the concept of iGEM, we started from building up dozens of sub-functions that represents a set of simple devices which were the fundamental bio-brick in synthetic biology. Then we searched some literatures and picked up a system for testing our novel modeling method. Two arrays of ODEs were defined for representation of the circuits we chose. A python script was written to integrate these ODEs.
As result, the plot from wet-lab experimental data was reproduced by our differential equations. The simulative output approximately matches the curve plotted in citation which  shows the idea that modeling single devices and linking them as connecting bio-brick works like we expected. In next step, we tried to plugin this function into our web app but we didn’t finish because time was over. It is hopefully to be done in future.

iGEM Team attributions page
Each team must clearly attribute work done by the student team members on this page.  The team must distinguish work done by the students from work done by others, including the host labs, advisors, instructors, and individuals not on the team roster.
Why do we have this requirement?
Attribution Template
We have this requirement to help the judges know what you did yourselves and what you had help with. We don't mind if you get help with difficult or complex techniques, just be sure to report the work your team did and the work that was done by others.
For example, you might choose to work with an animal model during your project. Working with animals requires getting a license and applying far in advance to conduct certain experiments in many countries. This is something that is difficult to achieve during the course of a summer, but much easier if you can work with a postdoc or PI who has the right licenses.
A great example of complete attribution comes from the Imperial College London 2011 team (scroll down to the bottom of their team page to see attributions).
Here are some of the fields we recommend you have on this page. If there are other areas not listed below, but applicable to your team/project, please feel free to also list them on your attributions page. Please feel free to remove any areas not applicable to your project.
General Support
Project support and advice
Fundraising help and advice
Lab support
Difficult technique support
Project advisor support
Wiki support
Presentation coaching
Policy & Practices support
Thanks and acknowledgements for all other people involved in helping make a successful iGEM team.

Project: the idea. We came to The Sexy Plant project after many brainstorming meetings including all the team. It would be impossible to define authors here: we all contributed to the design of the project.
Pheromone Biosynthesis. Design of the biosynthesis pathway fell on Jose Gavaldá and Lucía Estellés. Pheromone expression analysis by GC-MS was carried out by Alba Rubert, Alfredo Quijano, Lucía Estellés and Jose Gavaldá. Pheromone-insect interaction analysis by means of wind tunnel and EAG was made by Alba Rubert and Alfredo Quijano.
Pheromone Release and Switch. Alfredo Quijano was the responsible for the design and expression analysis of the trichome specific promoter. Copper inducible switch was designed by Alfredo Quijano.
Modeling. Ivan Llopis, also supported by Alejandra González, worked in the FBA modeling to try to obtain estimation of the pheromone production and to try to optimize it. Alejandra González was in charge of the pheromone diffusion and moth behavior modeling to help decide where and how much sexy plants we should put in the field.
Biosafety. Biosafety module was designed by Lucía Estellés, and Lucía was also the leader when fulfilling safety requirements: About our lab form (assisted by Alba, Alfredo and Jose), Check-in and Safety form.
Policy & Practices. Lucía Estellés, Jose Gavaldá, Alejandra González, Alba Rubert and Alfredo Quijano dealed with the organization and execution of interviews with some stakeholders involved in the project. All the students in the team participated in the presentation of the Sexy Plant project to relevant members of the UPV, CSIC (Spanish Research Council) and Bayer CropScience business chair. Alba Rubert, Alfredo Quijano, Alejandra González and Ivan Llopis participated in the Generación Espontánea event. Also all the students organized and carry out the Summer School courses. And Lucía, Jose, Alba and Alfredo organized and participated in the lipdub.
BioBricks. Lucía Estellés, helped by Alba Rubert, prepared the BioBricks for sending them to the Registry and documented the parts. Lucía was the designer of the Omega undercover part used to translate from GoldenBraid 2.0 to BioBricks standard.
Interlab Study. Lucía Estellés performed the measurement interlab study.
Art and Design. Alfredo Quijano was the major designer of the images used at the wiki, the presentation and the poster.
Wiki. Performed by Ivan Llopis.
Poster. Ivan Llopis worked in the poster design, all contributed with the concepts.
Talk. Lucía Estelles, Alfredo Quijano and Alejandra González. Also Alba Rubert performed Lucía's part when she was absent. All the team participated in the layout and conceptual flow.

The team
iGEM Evry team 2014 is composed of students from Licence 3 (3rd year after baccalaureate) to M2 (5th year after baccalaureate) from different universities and schools with various specialties as biology, computer science, biotechnology, ethics...     We worked together from June to October in order to realize our project. Each member brought his own knowledge and his ""savoir-faire"" to share and build the Sponge Patrol Project.
We have lived an amazing experience and adventure all together.
Laboratory
Biologist team spent summer in Institute of Systems & Synthetic Biology (ISSB), Evry working in the laboratory. The biologist team is composed of Cécile Jacry,  Laura Matabishi, Nandjafot Mendy, Noémie Berenger-Curria, Julie Zaworski, Sophia Belkhelfa , Romain Bodinier, Matthieu Da Costa and Johanna Chesnel. Biologist supervisors: Tiffany Souterre and Tristan Cerisy were presents and supportive.
Any piece of the ISSB laboratory is mysterious today.
Modelisation
Bioinformatic team spent summer in Institute of Systems & Synthetic Biology (ISSB), Evry working in partnership with biologist. The bioinformatic student team is composed of Bernard Jesop, Anaïs Louis and William Digan. Bioinformatic supervisors with Pierre Parutto and Adrien Basso-Blandin gave significant hand all along the project.
One day biologist and bioinformatist will be one.

iGEM Team attributions page
Each team must clearly attribute work done by the student team members on this page.  The team must distinguish work done by the students from work done by others, including the host labs, advisors, instructors, and individuals not on the team roster.
Why do we have this requirement?
Attribution Template
We have this requirement to help the judges know what you did yourselves and what you had help with. We don't mind if you get help with difficult or complex techniques, just be sure to report the work your team did and the work that was done by others.
For example, you might choose to work with an animal model during your project. Working with animals requires getting a license and applying far in advance to conduct certain experiments in many countries. This is something that is difficult to achieve during the course of a summer, but much easier if you can work with a postdoc or PI who has the right licenses.
A great example of complete attribution comes from the Imperial College London 2011 team (scroll down to the bottom of their team page to see attributions).
Here are some of the fields we recommend you have on this page. If there are other areas not listed below, but applicable to your team/project, please feel free to also list them on your attributions page. Please feel free to remove any areas not applicable to your project.

He is definitely the software guy of the team. Compared to his programming, what we others coded was playing around with code blocks. For him it was always, the lower the level, the better. Therefore he is writing pure C code, as C++ does already too much by itself, he thinks. But still, he was somehow pressed to this role, as normally he is studying molecular biotechnology in 5th semester now. As iGEM@home was running, and he thought he would have a break from programming, the wiki as a project came upon him. On top, he is a perfectionist on software sides, so not only once he called out: 'Nils, look how smooth the ring is moving!'""  },  ""Charlotte"": {    ""Name"" : ""Charlotte Bunne"",     ""img"" : ""/wiki/images/6/69/Heidelberg_Charlotte.jpg"",    ""Description"" : ""Charlotte is our youngest team member and already participated in iGEM in Germany´s first High School team in 2012. Studying Biosciences in her third semester, she impresses all team members with her energy, curiosity and ambition. She is the creative head behind nearly all artworks of our project. The wiki design originates from her imaginations and the BOINC video as well as the cover picture for our theme night “Religion and Synthetic Biology” arose from her hands. In team effort with Nils, she is conducting the linker screening experiments for the lysozyme circularization. In the course of these experiments Charlotte learned huge organisational skills that directs her abilities and energy into the right channels. In this way Charlotte became an indispensable team member.""  },  ""Nils"": {    ""Name"": ""Nils Klughammer"",     ""img"" : ""/wiki/images/f/ff/Heidelberg_Nils.jpg"",    ""Description"" : ""Nils will always be referred as the physicist in our team, because he implemented the whole CRAUT software and the lysozyme modelling. Furthermore he resigned to stand in the wet lab, and if just in full safety equipment – welling boots, helmet and welding goggles, was everything just to contaminated for him. Nils held the most motivation for circularisation, and were one oft he main leaders for ideas. Due to his structure, coordinate, and healthy life style, involvement in student parties he was very important in pulling the team together.""  },  ""Silvan"": {    ""Name"": ""Silvan Schmitz"",    ""img"" : ""/wiki/images/c/cf/Heidelberg_Silvan.jpg"",    ""Description"" : ""Silvan is studying Systems biology in his second year.

COLLABORATIONS
Besides spending a whole summer in the lab and developing an own project, iGEM is about meeting new people, people with the same interests, the same motivation, the same dedication. Collaborations between team ensure the exchange of ideas, therefore helping the field of Synthetic Biology to be interdisciplinary and creative - the best conditions to give rise to revolutionary projects. We are very happy to met some of the team members from Freiburg, Aachen, Tuebingen, Marburg and London.

4 iGEM Team Marburg
iGEM Team Aachen
Michael from the iGEM team Aachen visited us in Heidelberg. Their team worked on the development of a real-time pathogen detection technique for what they have build their own fluorescence measurement camera. We provided our expression vectors to the iGEM team Aachen, which they used to express their part E1010-K1319003 , the human galectin-3 protein fused to mRFP. Nicely seen in Figure 1 and 2 the the intensity of the red color is significantly higher for the induced sample with pSBX1A30 compared to the uninduced ones. To ensure the right molecular mass of the fusion protein, a SDS gel was run as well (Figure 3).
3) SDS-PAGE of K1319020 expression
2) Expression of Galectin-3
1) Expression of Galectin-3
More information about their project can be found on Aachens Galectin-3 site .
In exchange they offered to characterise these expression vectors with their own designed analyser by measuring the amount of produced fluorescent proteins. Unfortunately, transporting E.colis to another city wasn't as easy as expected, not all Bacteria were able to grow afterwards and we could only obtain sufficient data from pSBX4C5.
iGEM Team Tuebingen
The project of iGEM Team Tuebingen is about blood types and the difficulties that arises during blood donation of the wrong blood type. They aim to develop an easy system to convert blood types A, B, AB to the rares but also most applicable blood type 0. They have applied the method of intein targeting, a method which can also be found in our intein toolbox, to the N-Acetyl-Galactosaminidase protein. More about their project can be read in the very nice article they have wrote for our tumblr blog or on their own wiki .
In this collaboration, Tuebingen conducted a mass spectrometry analysis of our Lambda lysozyme to proof circularization. The data still has to be evaluated, but we will have them ready until the jamboree. There is a high demand for our expression vectors. Tuebingen had problems with expressing their constructs, therefore we send them some of our plasmids pSBX1K30 ( BBa_K1362093 ) and pSBX4K50 ( BBa_K1362097 ), as they showed to work really nicely even with big proteins like the Dnmt1 with 105kDa.
iGEM Team Freiburg
Three of our team members, Anna, Caro, and Charlotte visited the iGEM team Freiburg. We met the team right after a big team meeting, therefore we were able to hear their latest project developments. We spend the evening talking about experiences in the lab and about iGEM. It was relieving to hear that they faced similar difficulties in the lab.  The morning after we presented our project to the iGEM team Freiburg. Freiburg was very interested in our program iGEM@home as we offered them to promote their own human practice projects. You can also find an article about optogenetics on our tumblr blog. Both our teams are working with light inducible systems, manly the LOV domain. Although working in different organisms, the constructs were compatible, therefore we could interchange protocols for induction and preliminary results. Furthermore we gazed at their professional light induction box - we can definitely improved ours.
After cooperation with the iGEM Team Freiburg for two years in a row we are hoping to keep Freiburg as a reliable partner in the next years as well.
iGEM Team Marburg
The screensaver of iGEM@home is a great possibility to spread news and information about Synthetic Biology around the world. Lately, even other iGEM team have used this new option and filled our screensaver with slides about their own project. Marburg was able to promote their quiz app about Synthetic Biology.
A proposal of the German iGEM Teams concerning Intellectual Property
During the meetup of the German iGEM teams from 23rd to 25th May also workshops took place in which amongst others we discussed the topic of bioethics. Moral questions were addressed, regarding the value of life and human influence on it, as well as questions dealing with the possible socioeconomic effects of synthetic biology.
Especially the topic of an open source vs. patent controlled field accounted for a large part of the discussion. During the discussion one student brought up the point that the legal status of parts in registry remains unclear and that there are parts (e.g. BBa_K180009 ) where only upon a closer look it becomes clear that the rights are company–owned. The issue that the legal status of parts in the registry remains uncertain is also mentioned in a recent article published by Nature ( Bryn Nelson ‘Synthetic Biology: Cultural Divide ’, Nature 509, 152–154, 08 May 2014 ) :
""[N]o one can say with any certainty how many of these parts are themselves entirely free of patent claims.""
We, the German iGEM teams, therefore like to suggest the addition of a new feature to the parts registry:
A dedicated data field of license information for each BioBrick part.
For the implementation, we propose to introduce two new fields to BioBrick part entries in the registry:
A string property ""LicenseInfo""
A traffic light property (grey, green, yellow, red) to indicate the level of legal protection (unknown, BPA-like, free for research purposes, heavily protected)
Implementing this feature would in our opinion further clarify and extend the parts info, provide a machine-readable format and thus improve future entries. With the emerging Entrepreneurship track and applications getting closer to industrial realization, the legal status becomes more and more important. Also it would raise awareness to the topic of the legal status of parts, leading to a debate which could further promote the idea of open source. At the same time we hope that examination of most parts will show that they are indeed free of restrictive legal protections.

Ludwig XIV. gilt als klassischer Vertreter des höfischen Absolutismus. Der Leitsatz des Absolutismus, L’État, c’est moi! (Der Staat bin ich!) wird ihm jedoch fälschlicherweise zugeschrieben.[1] Er festigte die Macht der Krone durch den Ausbau der Verwaltung, die Bekämpfung der Opposition in Kreisen des Adels sowie durch die Förderung der französischen Wirtschaft. Die Hofkultur wurde ganz auf die Person des Herrschers zugeschnitten. Zum Symbol für dessen herausragende Stellung wurde sein prunkvolles Auftreten. Der König förderte Künste und Wissenschaften, was eine Blütezeit der französischen Kultur zur Folge hatte. Ludwig XIV. vertrat eine expansive und kriegerische Außenpolitik, durch die Frankreich unter seiner Regentschaft eine dominierende Stellung in Europa gewann und seine Großmachtstellung in der Neuzeit etablierte.

Our Team
We are a group of young and motivated students, and patient and  motivated supervisors, who love synthetic biology and wish to make an  important contribution to its advancement and acceptance by society.  This year we have a nice mix of wet-lab experts (who made tons and  tons of assays) and computer freaks (who wrote millions of code  lines). Plus a crazy physicist (who did many, many things – but not  involving a pipette!). Like good split inteins, we like to work only when assembled in a team!

Ludwig XIV
Subject
Lasagne
Age
7
Alias
The King
Ludwig XIV. gilt als klassischer Vertreter des höfischen Absolutismus. Der Leitsatz des Absolutismus, L’État, c’est moi! (Der Staat bin ich!) wird ihm jedoch fälschlicherweise zugeschrieben.[1] Er festigte die Macht der Krone durch den Ausbau der Verwaltung, die Bekämpfung der Opposition in Kreisen des Adels sowie durch die Förderung der französischen Wirtschaft. Die Hofkultur wurde ganz auf die Person des Herrschers zugeschnitten. Zum Symbol für dessen herausragende Stellung wurde sein prunkvolles Auftreten. Der König förderte Künste und Wissenschaften, was eine Blütezeit der französischen Kultur zur Folge hatte. Ludwig XIV. vertrat eine expansive und kriegerische Außenpolitik, durch die Frankreich unter seiner Regentschaft eine dominierende Stellung in Europa gewann und seine Großmachtstellung in der Neuzeit etablierte.

iGEM Team attributions page
Each team must clearly attribute work done by the student team members on this page.  The team must distinguish work done by the students from work done by others, including the host labs, advisors, instructors, and individuals not on the team roster.
Why do we have this requirement?
Attribution Template
We have this requirement to help the judges know what you did yourselves and what you had help with. We don't mind if you get help with difficult or complex techniques, just be sure to report the work your team did and the work that was done by others.
For example, you might choose to work with an animal model during your project. Working with animals requires getting a license and applying far in advance to conduct certain experiments in many countries. This is something that is difficult to achieve during the course of a summer, but much easier if you can work with a postdoc or PI who has the right licenses.
A great example of complete attribution comes from the Imperial College London 2011 team (scroll down to the bottom of their team page to see attributions).
Here are some of the fields we recommend you have on this page. If there are other areas not listed below, but applicable to your team/project, please feel free to also list them on your attributions page. Please feel free to remove any areas not applicable to your project.

– Behind the Ideas and the Data.
Students and Supervisors
To realize such a big project many people are needed. Meet all team members, read something about their character and see them in Boston!
Collaboration
Following the spirit of iGEM to encourage students from various scientific fields to work in a team we collaborate with different teams. We helped the iGEM Team Aachen and the iGEM Team Tübingen sending them our expression vectors to solve wet-lab problems. Click to read more!
Attributions
In the elaboration of our project we had many open questions and tasks we could not handle alone. A big thank you to all people helping and supporting us. Read more!
Sponsoring
Our project was funded by many sponsors. Without them, our work would not have been possible.

About Zhejiang University
Located in the historical and picturesque city of Hangzhou, Zhejiang University(ZJU) is a prestigious institution of higher education in China with a long history. Qiushi Academy, the predecessor of Zhejiang University, was founded in 1897 and was one of the earliest modern academies of higher learning established in China. During World War II, Zhejiang University suffered from disasters but insisted on the school spirits “Seeking the Truth”, and been praised as one of the Four most Prominent Universities in the Republic China. In its 115-year history, Zhejiang University has always been committed to cultivating talent with excellence, advancing science and technology, serving for social development, and promoting culture, with the spirit best manifested in the university motto “Seeking the Truth and Pioneering New Trails”.
Today, Zhejiang University is one of the top universities in China with distinctive features and a national as well as international impact. Research at ZJU spans 12 academic disciplines, covering philosophy, economics, law, education, literature, history, art, science, engineering, agriculture, medicine, management and etc. The elective system of ZJU is very flexible，so students can enroll whatever the courses they are interested in. That is why we could build such a team with various majors but have no difficulty in understanding each other.
Zhejiang University Anthem
The vast sea contains all streams, all rivers;
Great learning connects Heaven and Earth.
Metaphysical is Tao; instrumental is Tool.
Rites tell people apart; Music gets them together.
To know their relations would make us ever brighter.
There’s a national university standing by River Qiantang,
Whose eternal philosophy is seeking truth from facts.
Progressive education can produce those able to govern;
Never say you know the essence, let alone the truth.
Reform is necessary, and renewal is a must;
To be a vanguard is to be both creative and innovative;
Dear young vanguards should be clear of the principles.
Be devoted to study, deep in thinking and good in understanding;
We offer arts, science, agriculture, technology, and beyond;
It needs you to know them all -- their origins and applications.
To become successful people will be like true gold to be made;
To give up fractional views we’re of far sight and broad mind;
To rejuvenate our great nation is to harmonize the whole world.

Project
The GeneSocket’s idea is put forward by ourselves and became rich and colorful during countless discussion. All detail design and experiment are accomplished by our own.
Wet lab works
We divide our wet lab manpower into two groups: Lambda red group and circuit construct group.
Liangxi Wang, Sophie Chen, Peng Lei and Haoran Ma are in Lambda red group who do paper researches to summary Lambda red protocol. Although we meet many difficulties during this process, we finally get success in red recombination!
Haniqng Liu, Chaofan Zhang, Qing Xia, Chuanyun Xu is in circuit design group. We design all the circuit and construction strategy by ourselves. Circuit and it’s function is also tested by this group.
Our advisor Zhihui Qin and Qingshu Wu also provide generous help and experiment guide to us.
Dry lab works
Haoran Ma is the designer and builder of our software tool: GS-BOX. Wei Liu accomplish Modeling of GeneSocket. Zhe Zhu design and writing our wiki.
Human practice and other works
Tianyu Li handle all the financial affairs of our team. She also design and organize human practice activities. Tianyu Li, Haoran Ma and Chuanyun Xu organize our songs for iGEM.

iGEM Team attributions page
Each team must clearly attribute work done by the student team members on this page.  The team must distinguish work done by the students from work done by others, including the host labs, advisors, instructors, and individuals not on the team roster.
Why do we have this requirement?
Attribution Template
We have this requirement to help the judges know what you did yourselves and what you had help with. We don't mind if you get help with difficult or complex techniques, just be sure to report the work your team did and the work that was done by others.
For example, you might choose to work with an animal model during your project. Working with animals requires getting a license and applying far in advance to conduct certain experiments in many countries. This is something that is difficult to achieve during the course of a summer, but much easier if you can work with a postdoc or PI who has the right licenses.
A great example of complete attribution comes from the Imperial College London 2011 team (scroll down to the bottom of their team page to see attributions).
Here are some of the fields we recommend you have on this page. If there are other areas not listed below, but applicable to your team/project, please feel free to also list them on your attributions page. Please feel free to remove any areas not applicable to your project.
General Support
Project support and advice
Fundraising help and advice
Lab support
Difficult technique support
Project advisor support
Wiki support
Presentation coaching
Policy & Practices support
Thanks and acknowledgements for all other people involved in helping make a successful iGEM team.

CHO Haemin
2nd year, BSc in Biotechnology
Haemin is a second year student majoring in Biotechnology. She is one of the two leaders of this year HKUST iGEM team. In the lab, she works diligently and is very helpful when needed. But most of the time, she looks blank-minded and often makes small careless mistakes. Her trademark quote is ""What did I just do? *blank face*
JOO Min Jung
2nd year, BSc in Biochemistry and Cell Biology
""What should be our team name... Pneutella? Pneutorious? ...Finding Pneumo!! Wait, let me draw a fish :)""
AW Jacqueline Theeng Mei
2nd year, BSc in Biochemistry and Cell Biology
Jacqueline is a year two student majoring in Biochemistry and Cell Biology. Apart from being a junior member in iGEM team, she is also the secretary of the team. Claiming to have above-standard laboratory skills, she performed various kinds of experiments. Quite often, she will work in the laboratory from 9am to 6pm. Unsurprisingly, she likes to attend every meeting and make reminders and minutes for every meeting. EVERY MEETING! (To those who don’t read her emails, be careful). Enjoying iGEM competition, she likes to perform site directed mutagenesis and Gibson assembly daily. Rapping is one of her precious abilities as well as stalking others. Indeed she is the number ONE stalker in the team. Although she tried very hard to shed this title, the fact that she is a stalker will not change.
CHAN Yuk Pui Alfie
3rd year, BSc in Biochemistry and Cell Biology
Alfie has done so much for the team and to the lab. He also had a particular affection to the centrifuge. He loved it so much that he sometimes SLAMMED the cover to make sure it’s closed, then Raul would be jealous and said ""DON’T SLAM THE CENTRIFUGE!"" *Hmm... I wonder why the centrifuge got replaced* Alfie also liked the newly replaced centrifuge. He put smaller tubes than required- maybe thinking the big tubes were too heavy for the centrifuge, but he had to take care of the mess of broken tubes and split DNA inside the centrifuge. Lastly, he worked as a great team manager, and helped out the whole team by transferring to many different teams.
MAHANADI Albert
2nd year, BSc in Biotechnology
Albert is a gentleman who cares about other people. He is one of the two people in charge of Human Practice group. Funny random thing about him: he likes to play games in the lab. He is Indonesian but he learned how to say bad words in Korean. So be careful when he starts speaking in Korean!
KIM Hye Ji
2nd year, BSc in Business and Management
Hye Ji is a sweet, soft-spoken girl who works mainly on human practice but helps out in the lab as well. She is the matchmaker of the team. She makes the other girls play 'Ideal Type World Cup' to find their best match in the iGEM team. Rumour has it that she also gives free relationship advice on the side.
TANG Tsz Ching Chloe
2nd year, BSc in Biochemistry and Cell Biology
Chloe is a second year student from Hong Kong taking her major in Biochemistry and Cell Biology. She is the PIC of the second group of the team. She is in charge of assigning and coordinating the group work. Other than that, Chloe is also competing with Jacqueline to be the number one stalker in the team; but up to this day, she has not been recognized as such, and ranked only third. Favorite quote: ""I don't like colony PCR, so I make my groupmates do it hehe""
GOTAMA Rinaldi
2nd year, BSc in Biological Sciences
Rinaldi is from Indonesia. He is really good at photoshop and graphic design and is in charge of the graphic design team. He is famous for coming up with wacky names for the team and other team members. He is also famous for his shouting matches with Chloe in the lab. He tries to be serious and fierce at times but we all know that he is a softie at heart.
HAN Gyucheol James
2nd year, BSc in Biotechnology
James is very tall and like to dance. He often wears a cap to the lab and classes. He is very friendly and open to everyone, and want to befriend with anybody. He is a very calm person that never complains, and always does what he wants. His life seems very simple and uncomplicated.
TONG Guillaume Huiming
2nd year, BEng in Computer Engineering
Guillaume is also known as William. He is a sophomore majoring in Computer Engineering and responsible for coding the Wiki page.  Although he majors in a subject unrelated to biology, he is very keen to learn about synthetic biology in iGEM. His ultimate goal is to build a cyborg! He loves woodcarving, baking, and playing violin.
SULAIMAN Jordy Evan
2nd year, BEng in Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering
Jordy is a year two student majoring in Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering. He is hard-working, diligent, and creative. He likes to eat, play basketball, and play computer games. Above all, he likes Doyle the most. Though Jordy is very funny, sometimes he can be extremely serious when doing something. The scary part of Jordy is that he is good at everything, even arts. Everyone likes Jordy.
WIDJAJA Angeline
2nd year, BEng in Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering
Angie is the angel of iGEM. She is a cheerful girl who likes to work but also have fun at the same time. She loves to play basketball and play games with other people. She is excellent at making friends. There's nothing bad about her except for her spontaneous randomness. But that characteristic of hers is what makes iGEM fun in some way or another. Interesting and unique people are the ones who everyone should cherish.
BONGSO Nadia Benedicta
2nd year, BEng in Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering
She is one of the rare team members that do not major in Life Science, she is a year 2 student majoring Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering (but still, biology is involved). She is one of the 3-man Indonesian gang, which contributes to most of the noise in lab. She is indeed very helpful in the lab, such as helping to fill boxes of tips just after a few hours she landed in HK. She also helped much in Human Practice work. She is quite absent-minded about her iPad, luckily she does not forget her lab work. She LOVES people calling her surname, and she really likes Hong Kong Disneyland.
SUH Joseph
2nd year, BSc in Biochemistry and Cell Biology
Joseph is a second year student majoring Biochemistry and Cell Biology from South Korea. He is one of the two people in charge of Human Practice group.  He is incapable of waking up early in the morning which is why he always gets the afternoon shift for doing the lab works. He likes playing music and eating sushi. Above all, Joseph is very funny and really like goofing around with the other members.
JANG Sang Jin Jason
2nd year, BSc in Biochemistry and Cell Biology
Jason is a second year student majoring in Biochemistry and Cell Biology. He is from Korea but he spent most of his life in Singapore. He contributed to module 2 by using ""educated guess"" to figure out the gene sequence of combox. He is in the wiki team and contributes to build up the wiki page website.
NG Siu Wang Edward
2nd year, BSc in Biotechnology
Edward is known as a hardworking and diligent lab worker (or lover), that his passion has been our treasure. But everyone also remembered that Edward put 30μl of DNA ladder instead of 1μl when he ran a gel. I guess every newbie has made their own stupid mistakes. Even though he presented himself as nice as possible in front of everyone, he is really mean and snarky when he is speaking in Cantonese!
CUELLAR Raul M.
3rd year, BSc in Biological Sciences
Raul is a third year student majoring in Biological Sciences. He is one of our two senior members this year. He seems very intimidating at first but once you get to know him, he will joke around you until you are annoyed. He is also one of the busiest and most patient person in the lab, doing lab tasks and answering everyone's questions at the same time. Warning: when he starts telling one of his PBAD jokes... RUN FOR YOUR LIVES!!
LEE Jihwan
3rd year, BSc in Molecular Biomedical Sciences
Jihwan is one of the two senior members of our iGEM team. This is his second year of participation, and he devotes much of his time and efforts into bringing the riboregulator project to a success. He kindly provides help and advice to us as an experienced senior. Being all-rounded in both academic and non-academic pursuits, he is the role model for inspiring the younger minds of our team to strive for excellence.
CHEUNG Ming Fung Eric
2nd year, BSc in Biochemistry and Cell Biology
Ming Fung, or Eric, is not only a second year student majoring in Biochemistry and Cell Biology, but also a computer guru who helps in coding our wiki page. Being calm and serious are two of his conspicuous traits. He is a diligent, responsible and obliging person and you will find him very comfortable to work with once you get to know him. Although he looks serious, sometimes he gives hilarious one-liners that makes everyone in the lab laugh out loud.
PARK Hojeong Bonnie
2nd year, BSc in Biochemistry and Cell Biology
Hojeong, or Bonnie, is a sophomore in Biochemistry and Cell Biology, and Chemistry (YES, she majors in BOTH). She loves cats, and she is simply the most artistic person in the whole team. She often takes her passion regarding cats and art to another level, and overwhelms people with her perks and quirkiness. Sometimes, she even labels herself as a 'cat'. She meows constantly in the lab for 'luck'.

iGEM Team attributions page
Each team must clearly attribute work done by the student team members on this page.  The team must distinguish work done by the students from work done by others, including the host labs, advisors, instructors, and individuals not on the team roster.
Why do we have this requirement?
Attribution Template
We have this requirement to help the judges know what you did yourselves and what you had help with. We don't mind if you get help with difficult or complex techniques, just be sure to report the work your team did and the work that was done by others.
For example, you might choose to work with an animal model during your project. Working with animals requires getting a license and applying far in advance to conduct certain experiments in many countries. This is something that is difficult to achieve during the course of a summer, but much easier if you can work with a postdoc or PI who has the right licenses.
A great example of complete attribution comes from the Imperial College London 2011 team (scroll down to the bottom of their team page to see attributions).
Here are some of the fields we recommend you have on this page. If there are other areas not listed below, but applicable to your team/project, please feel free to also list them on your attributions page. Please feel free to remove any areas not applicable to your project.
General Support
Project support and advice
Fundraising help and advice
Lab support
Difficult technique support
Project advisor support
Wiki support
Presentation coaching
Policy & Practices support
Thanks and acknowledgements for all other people involved in helping make a successful iGEM team.

There are a few wiki requirements teams must follow:
All pages, images and files must be hosted on the 2014.igem.org server .
All pages must be created under the team’s name space.
As part of your documentation, keep the links from the menu to the left.
Do not use flash in wiki code.
The iGEM logo should be placed on the upper part of every page and should link to 2014.igem.org .
Visit the Wiki How To page for a complete list of requirements, tips and other useful information.
Tips
We are currently working on providing teams with some easy to use design templates.
In the meantime you can also view other team wikis for inspiration! Here are some very good examples
2013 SDU Denmark
2013 SYSU China
2013 Shenxhen BGIG ATCG
2013 Colombia Unianades
2013 Lethbridge
For a full wiki list, you can visit iGEM 2013 web sites and iGEM 2012 web sites lists.
This wiki will be your team’s first interaction with the rest of the world, so here are a few tips to help you get started:
State your accomplishments! Tell people what you have achieved from the start.
Be clear about what you are doing and what you plan to do.
You have a global audience! Consider the different backgrounds that your users come from.
Make sure information is easy to find; nothing should be more than 3 clicks away.
Avoid using very small fonts and low contrast colors; information should be easy to read.
Start documenting your project as early as possible; don’t leave anything to the last minute before the Wiki Freeze. For a complete list of deadlines visit the iGEM 2013 calendar
Have lots of fun!

Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology is located in Terre Haute, Indiana. Rose-Hulman has participated in the iGEM competition for the past three years, and recently built a new state of the art synthetic biology lab. With this new lab, Rose-Hulman plans to further develop its synthetic biology program, as well as continuing to participate in the iGEM competition for years to come.
This year's team consists of seven team members along with two advisers. Three of the team members are pursuing Biology degrees and three are pursuing Biomedical Engineering degrees, while one member is majoring in Art. We believe that a balance of engineering and science brought great utility to our team and can be seen throughout our project.

iGEM team members
The Brauer Group: Jeffrey worked with Benjamin Huang as part of the Brauer Group. They were in charge of the light regulation aspect of the WashU iGEM project. Ben and Jeffrey spent most of the summer cloning and testing the light regulated transcription elements.
Ben also spent a significant amount of time coding and making the team wiki page look pretty awesome. He did most of the coding for the site through self-learning of html and often sought Google for help involving web design elements. He did not use any outside resources or companies to code the site, but borrowed inspiration and snippets of code from previous iGEM teams: in particular 2013 WLC-Milwaukee, 2013 TMU-Tokyo, and 2012 WashU. He also began work on the kinetic model system of the light regulation system. He continued cloning work during the school year, along with taking over organization of the team and keeping up with the many deadlines when Jeffrey went abroad.
Jeffrey worked on managing the team, setting up meetings, and having conversations with the school administration and other iGEM teams. He also worked to create our team apparel.
The Rebstock Group: Caroline Focht worked with Richard Li as part of the Rebstock Group. They were in charge of the plasmid design and Nif activity testing aspect of the WashU iGEM project. Caroline and Richard spent most of their time in summer in protocol development and nitrogen fixation activity testing. They continued running experiments and biobricked during the school year.
Caroline also concentrated on WashU iGEM Outreach program, which produced numerous educational videos, and sought out other iGEM teams for collaborations. She also produced most of our logos and graphics for the website and presentations.
Richard was lab manger of iGEM at Washington University in St. Louis, thus in addition to the wet lab work he was also in charge of fundraising and securing for the project.

Project Support:
Dr. Himadri Pakrasi and Dr. Tae Seok Moon served as mentors during our iGEM project. We had a few meetings with them in order to present our project proposals and check on our progress updates, and helped to give us feedback and troubleshoot when necessary. They provided the funding for lab supplies.
Dr. Pakrasi: Dr. Pakrasi is Myron and Sonya Glassberg/Albert and Blanche Greensfelder Distinguished University Professor, also Director of International Center for Advanced Renewable Energy and Sustainability (I-CARES). His research interests are: Photosynthesis, Nitrogen Fixation, Systems and Synthetic Biology. Pakrasi Lab’s current focus is on Bioenergy Production in Cyanobacteria.
Dr. Tae Seok Moon: Dr. Moon is a Principal Investigator and Assistant Professor in the Department of Energy, Environmental & Chemical Engineering (EECE) at Washington University in St. Louis and heads the Moon Research Group (MRG). He generously allowed Ben and Jeffrey unfettered access to his lab and material equipment at all hours of the day (and night). Dr. Moon also financed ordering of primers and DNA sequence verification.
Our team would not be complete without our list of direct advisors: Andrew Ng, Bert Berla, Cheryl Immethun, and Dr. Deng Liu.
Andrew Ng:  Andrew is an undergraduate biomedical engineer interested in the applications of systems and synthetic biology to cyanobacteria. He was also a past participant in iGEM at WashU. As the major peer advisor for iGEM project this year, Andrew provided invaluable advice and guidance on all aspects of both Rebstock and Brauer Group’s work, ranging from protocol design and lab technique training to providing material support for the GC activity testing.
Bertram Berla:  Bert is a PhD candidate in Energy, Environmental, and Chemical Engineering. He is working to apply techniques developed to optimize the operation of chemical reactors to get more useful stuff out of our favorite micro-reactors: cyanobacteria. Bert assisted Richard and Caroline on experimental design.
Cheryl Immethun: Ms. Immethun is currently a PhD candidate in the MRG with Dr. Moon in the EECE department at Washington University in St. Louis. She serves as a senior iGEM advisor and over the course of the summer, provided invaluable advice and guidance on all aspects of the Brauer Group’s work, ranging from primer design and DNA cloning issues to providing material support for the light experiment. She also aided with cloning during the school year closer to the deadline as work conflicts slowed down progress.
Deng Liu: Deng is interested in the research on cyanobacteria, especially on the synthetic biology and transcriptional regulation in cyanobacteria. Deng helped iGEM members on details of experimental design, plasmid design, and cell culturing.
Our Non-iGEM affiliated advisors worked in their respective labs and would help us on a daily basis, whether it giving valuable input on experimental or cloning protocols or feedback during our project presentations. The list includes:
Allie Hoynes-O’Connor, Ray Henson, Ryan Lee , and Tatenda Shopera: The graduate students of the MRG helped the Brauer Group by aiding in answering every day questions and making sure we contributed to the well-being and material readiness of the lab as well as following all safety and labeling protocols. Ms. Hoynes-O’Connor served as our lab safety officer and gave us guidance and training on lab safety procedures. Mr. Henson also gave guidance and plasmid material in the Brauer Group’s early attempts at constructing a sequence verifiable chromophore.
Kenneth Ng and Soo Ji Kim: Kenneth and Soo Ji are laboratory technician staff in the MRG and helped resupply the lab’s vital operating stock materials and equipment in addition to giving advice and answering questions the iGEM students had. Kenneth provided his advanced expertise in adjusting and optimizing protocols drawn from his vast knowledge due to a highly inquisitive nature.
Nancy Duan: Nancy is the technician in the Rebstock lab. She takes responsibilities of maintaining cyanobacteria culture and assisting iGEM in doing experiments such as PCR, sub-cloning, plasmid preparation etc.
Jingjie Yu: Jingjie works on developing a new cyanobacteria model system for synthetic biology purpose, especially, for biofuel production. During iGEM project, she provided detailed advice on nearly all aspect of experiment for Rebstock group.
At Monsanto, a group of scientists specializing in nitrogen fixation sat in on our team’s presentation about the outlook of our nitrogen fixation project and offered plenty of suggestions through the advisory panel meeting. The diagnostic panel meeting with scientists of Monsanto later proved to be productive for the design and procedure of the lab work.
Modeling Support:
Andrew Ng: Andrew also helped to create the list of kinetic equations for our model.
Brandon Nicklas: Brandon Nicklas is an undergraduate at Penn State; he helped us to design a kinetic model for our light regulation system. Unfortunately we did not continue with the model as we were missing some experimental values that we ran out of time to find.
Rajib Saha: Rajib is a PhD candidate at Penn State; he worked as a liaison between Penn State and WashU and guided Brandon and gave us feedback on the modeling.
Human Practices Support:
Beyond the support of lab work design, Monsanto, and in particular Jose Prado, project lead of a paper published about how projects go from concept to market, provided human resources and materials including data sets, Power-point slides and presentations to enhance WashU’s iGEM video series.
Financial & Lab Facilities:
Pakrasi Group: Dr. Pakrasi and his research group at Washington University in St. Louis provided material and working space support for both Rebstock and Brauer Group.
Moon Group: Dr. Moon and his research group provided material and working space support for the Brauer group.
Zhang Group: Dr. Zhang and his research group at Washington University in St. Louis provided material support when we were lacking certain chemicals and let us use their temperature controlled growth chamber in which we conducted our light regulation experiments.
Sigma-Aldrich has supported WashU iGEM program since 2012. This year, Tonya Jackson, the Product Manager of Genomics and Research, provided help by not only offering funding for our project, gave us feedback on our presentation, and also provided us a sample of a new prototype media “EnPresso B” to test and enhance growth of our colonies.
Monsanto’s sponsorship continued in 2014 through material and advisorial means. On Wednesday, June 4, our team was invited to visit Monsanto Headquarters and its affiliated facilities. The tour gave team members a terrific impression about industrial-sized biotechnology development procedure and growth capabilities.
WashU iGEM would like to thank Washington University School of Arts & Sciences , Washington University School of Engineering , Washington University Office of Undergraduate Research , Washington University International Center for Advanced Renewable Energy and Sustainability , Sigma-Aldrich and Monsanto for providing funding for stipends and materials. Lastly, we would like to thank SnapGene for their software to aid our plasmid designs.

Meet The 2014 iGEM team!
Jeffrey Lee
Hello! I am Jeffrey, a rising senior majoring in Biology and minoring in Public Health. I am working with Ben to develop a light regulated transcriptional mechanism. When I’m not spending copious amounts of time in lab, I can be found working on applications for medical school, playing Ultimate Frisbee, tossing frisbees, and any other activity relating to frisbees. I enjoy cooking, reading and late night/early morning runs around campus.
Benjamin Huang
Oh hey there! I'm Ben, a rising sophomore who is planning on majoring in Biomedical Engineering. I am part of the group that is working on gene expression with light. Outside of lab, I am the web designer for our iGEM team. It is the first time I am coding in html and css so there is a big learning curve, but it is a lot of fun regardless. In my free time, I like to go to the gym, watch netflix, and am attempting to learn to cook!
Caroline Focht
Hello there! I'm Caroline, and I am a rising sophomore majoring in chemistry with a biochemistry concentration. This summer, I am working with Richard to get a nif cluster from a cyanobacteria working in E. coli . When not doing lab work, I work on the team's social media presence and outreach program. We're filming a short web series for our YouTube channel, so you should check it out! When I can tear myself away from those things, I enjoy watching period dramas, trying out new restaurants, taking a jog in the early evening, and talking to friends.
Richard Li
Hola! My name's Richard. I am a rising sophomore majoring in Biomedical Engineering and Mathematics.  I work on attempting to express nif clusters from cyanobacteria in E. coli strains in various environmental conditions. As lab manager of the iGEM team for WashU, I enjoy interactions with scholars in institutions as well as with prokaryotic cells in media. Viewing our team's job as inception of agricultural future, I am glad to be one of the members here. Out of lab, my interests range from reading to aviation, and I am also a puppy lover.
Meet Our Faculty Advisors!

Bert Berla
Hi! I'm Bert- a PhD candidate in the Pakrasi lab. I am working to apply techniques developed to optimize the operation of chemical reactors to get more useful stuff out of our favorite micro-reactors: cyanobacteria. Cyanobacteria created most of the organic material that time and geological forces turned into the fossil fuels we rely on to meet our energy and materials needs today. I believe that engineered cyanobacterial strains can play a major part in meeting those needs in the future. I am working to create those strains. In my life outside the lab, I like to build things, ride and race my bicycle, and hang out with my wife Jenny, our baby girl Evan, and the handsomest dog in the world, Monster.
Dr. Deng Liu
I'm Deng, a postdoc researching in the Pakrasi lab. I am interested in the research on cyanobacteria, especially on the synthetic biology and transcriptional regulation in cyanobacteria. At present, I am responsible for the nitrogen fixation project in the lab. Because of the various species of cyanobacteria, it is possible to make the non-diazotrophic cyanobacteria to fix nitrogen under the control of circadian clock as some diazotrophic cyanobacteria show in nature. In this work, many experimental approaches are used, such as molecular biology, biochemistry, genetic engineering and so on.
Cheryl Immethun
Hi, I’m Cheryl, a PhD candidate in the Moon Research Group.  I am developing synthetic biology tools for cyanobacteria, mainly utilizing transcriptional regulation.  Through their millions of years of evolution, cyanobacteria have developed amazing capabilities that I would like to employ for societal needs.  By unlocking the secrets of nitrogen fixation in a photosynthetic cell, we could one day transform agriculture to keep up with the demands of our ever expanding population.  My passions are solving puzzles (in and out of the lab,) as well as exciting students about the mysteries of science and helping them develop the tools to become society’s problem solvers.
Andrew Ng
I am a rising senior majoring in Biomedical Engineering and am an alumnus of WashU iGEM 2012. Currently I am working on engineering cyanobacteria to better produce proteins in the Pakrasi Lab. I hope to attend graduate school to pursue a PhD in Bioengineering after graduation. Outside of the lab I can be found reading, biking, or cooking.

Synthetic biology is more than ever at the centre of economical and industrial stakes in agro, pharma, energy, biosensors and synthetic chemistry fields. This project is perfectly integrated in my course as future genetic scientist. It allowed me to go deeper into details, to improve my skills in molecular biology (cloning strategies and processes, normalization) and to get a multidisciplinary approach in problems. The iGEM in an unique adventure which gathers rigorousness, autonomy and team work integrated in a project that allows interesting meetings with people sharing the same passion.
Jean-Rémy Brossier (3rd year of Bachelor’s degree in Biology)
In the last 40 years, technological advancement in health has been dazzling. Thanks to this, several new scientific fields emerged like synthetic biology, nanotechnology, biotechnology… Synthetic biology is one of the principal stakes of the next years. The iGEM competition has the goal of making synthetic biology known thanks to the involvement of students. I have been in the iGEM team of Bordeaux last year and I wanted to start over this year. The values taught by this competition (helping each other, cooperation, team spirit) correspond to my own vision of what is biology. It is also an opportunity to acquire knowledge in specific domains that are less known (thanks to the multidisciplinary team). iGEM is an ideal occasion to begin with my wish to become a genetic researcher and to expand my network in this field, while meeting people sharing the same passion.
Mounir Benkoulouche (2Y Biotechnology engineer student at ENSTBB)
I am a third-year student in MS of biotechnology in a French engineering school. I've been involved in the iGEM since two years. After the first year of participation, I was utterly motivated to renew this incredible adventure. This time, my job was to recruit a team and then to supervise the theoretical work during the meetings, giving a hand on all the aspects thanks to the experience from my first participation. Even if I couldn't take part in the labwork due to my synthetic biology internship at Evolva SA, I am one hundred percent with my teammates to win a gold medal in Boston!
Hiba Ben Mohamed (3rd year of Bachelor’s degree in Biology)
Biology is a science which always evolves as years pass. Its combination with engineering concepts gave birth to synthetic biology. This particular field contributes to the conception of microorganisms with the capacity of achieving different biological functions, useful for many applications (industry, environment, health). The iGEM represents the future discoveries, realized by students eager to learn and this participation will help me to enrich with both personal and professional aspects. As I would like to dedicate my career to research in microbiology, the iGEM allows me to acquire new skills and to work in a team in order to help each other to fulfill the objectives. I am passionate by science and music this is why every morning I set on fire all the lab! I discovered iGEM on TV and I was ready to participate for the next year to this amazing experience. So now I am representing my city with a fabulous project, I meet people from all over the world and this contributes to make me more mature and competent!
Edouard TOURDOT (2nd year of Bachelor’s degree in Biology)
I’m a 23 years old student in 3rd undergraduate year in biology. Sciences and more especially biology interest me from my childhood. The iGEM competition allow me to feed my curiosity about synthetic biology, I love the idea that you can barely try to create what your imagination tell you to do. I think we can hit the gold medal, and I already know I want to be part of the aventure again.
Justine Turlin (1Y Biotechnology engineer student at ENSTBB)
I am a second-year student in MS of biotechnology in a French engineering school. I discovered the IGEM Competition through other students of my school who joined the Bordeaux team the previous year. They told me that it’s an incredible experience in the scientific and human angle and they could not be so right. It was my first time taking part in a scientific project of this scale and I greatly appreciate to have this opportunity, so thanks you guys. My job during the project was to research informations for the theoretical work and take part in the labwork.  My name is Claudia Smith mena. This is my second time that I participate in this competition and this is absolutely my best experience. The team and the various people who have intervened in the project were able to set up something where everyone can be proud of. I meet someone with who I link a solid friendship but also helped me gain skills and autonomy significant for the future.
Caroline Rousseau (1Y Biotechnology engineer student at ENSTBB)
I am a 21 year-old student in 2nd year at the engineering school ENSTBB. I have discovered the iGEL thanks to another student in my school who has already participated in the iGEM the year before. I am excited to participate in this 10th anniversary of iGEM 2014! I hope to learn more about synthetic biology and how it can influence our lives and the society in general.
Lauriane NATHOU (Master 1 Biologie et Biotechnologie des plantes et des champignons)
In several fields, synthetic biology is an innovative alternative which can bring solutions for fundamental research, pharmaceutics or in ecology. Working on microorganism is essential and the original ideas brought by students are more likely to be the beginning of tomorrow big discoveries. Following this mentality, the iGEM competition allows a blossoming at short and middle terms by provoking a strong healthy rivalry. My experience from last year brought me a lot and I would like to have the opportunity to go even further this year to highly bring the work of the team of Bordeaux.
Diane BUGEAUD (1Y Biotechnology engineer student at ENSTBB)
Biology is everywhere, all around us. This makes it a wide field to explore and the discoveries left to be done seem countless. The everlasting biological evolution makes it attractive and also fascinating. Synthetic biology is fast-growing and the fields in which it is used are numerous like conception of new drugs, new recyclable materials, biofuels. The current and future needs destined it to a bright prospect. The iGEM will allow me to acquire deeper knowledge, to learn fast and to get the useful experience needed for my future career of engineer. This scientific competition gathers all the biology-passionate which makes it a unique human adventure.
Besson Xavier (1Y Biotechnology engineer student at ENSTBB):
Biotechnologies are booming and will be without a doubt at the center of many fields in the next few years. Throughout the complexity of the resources provided by nature and the techniques that always progress, the prospects for biotechnologies are varied and numerous (personalized medicine, energy sources). The iGEM allows students to be at the heart of innovation by imagining every year experiments vying of originality and ingenuity. On a more personal level, this experience represents for me the occasion of exchanging with people from different horizons, gathered around a common passion: biology. This is also the occasion to follow the evolution of a scientific project, from the idea to its conception and to familiarize with my future job as an engineer.
Julien CAPIN (1Y Biotechnology engineer student at ENSTBB)
I discovered the iGEM competition thanks to TV. Back then I was just in high-school and I did not know what to do for my studies. I was literally fascinated to see hundreds of students presenting all more ambitious than the others. I think it was the sign and that is why I am now an engineer student in biotechnology, and of course, an iGEMer!
Geoffrey DE OLIVEIRA (1Y Biotechnology engineer student at ENSTBB)
The biotechnology field is fast-growing and progresses at an exponential level since a few year. It is separated in different fields like synthetic biology. It allows the conception of biological devices by modifying bacterial genomes for food-processing, therapeutic or environmental goals. It is also applied to other very interesting fields. The diversity and complexity of organisms bring more and more knowledge to researchers and engineers, allowing the conception of new technologies always more powerful thanks to synthetic biology. The worldwide contest iGEM hosted by the prestigious MIT allow us all, students, to create our own synthetic biology project and to share the generated knowledge and our passion with other students from all around the world. This competition is before everything else a human experience. For me it was also a huge opportunity to live a real research experience with a dynamic and multidisciplinary team, allowing me to confront the real challenges met by a biotechnology engineer.
Cassandra Sabas (1st year of Master’s degree in Biomaterials and Medical Devices)
I’m 23 years old and I’m currently finishing my studies on biomaterials and medical devices at the University of Bordeaux. I heard about iGEM competition while I was looking for a facultative internship for my master. A friend of mine, who was a member of past iGEM Bordeaux’s team, talk to me about the project of iGEM Bordeaux for this year  and I was really excited about it, I wanted to be a part of it so here I am !
Gilles KREMBEL-SAUTOT (2nd year of Bachelor’s degree in Biology)
In my 3rd undergraduate year in biology, I always was interested in sciences. I discovered the synthetic biology two years ago by reading some articles or talking around, and I immediately enjoyed this field. Synthetic biology allows us to resolve some modern problems by genetic engineering. In my opinion, it is really awesome to think that a common bacteria could purify water, create polymers or some other crazy projects that iGEM had gave birth to. So, when I heard about the iGEM, I though it was a great luck to start to work on synthetic biology. This competition was a unique opportunity to work in a real lab, in a team, and to bring our project the further possible. I am Gilles, from the iGEM team of Bordeaux, and I am glad to participate this year !
Ismael Mullor Ruiz (5th Year of License in Biotechnology at Universitat Politècnica de Valencia (Spain))
Taking part on this contest was almost mandatory for me. As Former 2012 Valencia iGEM team member, I had previously had a very positive experience with the contest: it was one on my first contacts with the reality of the lab working, the variety of ideas that we had and those we observed on the rest of the teams was trully mind-broading and mind-bending and I also made some of my best friends ever during that experience. So I thought that taking part again on the contest (in an unplanned manner I have to admit, since it was the last thing I expected to do during my Erasmus) trying to have the best of that experience with some extra experience would be positive- so it has been. About the current project I have to admit that the first thing about it that fascinated me was the multidisciplinarity of the approach, its implications on the green chemistry field and its potential applications for tissue engineering scaffolds.
Amir NAAR (First Year of Master in Bioinformatics)
The iGEM is a worldwide competition involving students from all across the globe. They meet each year to defend their project and I wanted to be part of the team that will defend the project of Bordeaux. I am a student in bioinformatics passionate by new technologies and at the interface of these two fields. I find it particularly interesting all the applications that hard sciences can bring to the world of living sciences in order to understand them better. The iGEM is a formidable human adventure gathering teamwork, collaboration and solidarity. Each team member can bring a brick to build the whole edifice, and it is also a very original and efficient method to learn more while following a real research project almost from scratch.

Team:Bordeaux/Attributions
From 2014.igem.org
A project is like a seed which require some elements to grow up, in order to bud
This is why our team required the help of others specialist in different domains.
The work lab was done by 10 members of the Igem Bordeaux team 2014 during the summer, we were subdivised into groups and each one was responsible for a particular task.
The students developed the project during several brainstorming sessions at the European Institute of Chemistry and Biology.
All of the designs, constructs, and experiments presented in this Wiki were performed by the students of the team.
The instructors and advisors were providing feedbacks and advice, when it was needed.

Host lab
Bordeaux IGEM team was hosted at the European Institute of Chemistry and Biology(IECB), which allows many scientist to share and develop their projects. It is a multi-disciplinary institute focused on biology, chemistry & informatics.
Several labs hosted in the IECB provided us all the machines necessary for microbiology and molecular biology such as centrifuges, thermocyclers, sterile hoods, freezers, incubators, microscopes, plate readers, glassware, spectrophotometer and so on. We were in charge of taking care of the stocks as well as ordering lab consumables such as gloves, plates, pipettes, tips, and tubes as well as chemicals and DNA.
Bertrand GARBAY (EA4135) :
Professor and researcher in the University of Bordeaux, he allowed our team to manage the construction of recombinant DNA coding for the ELPs and the production of these proteins. This work is based on Bertrand GARBAY (EA4135)  and Laure BATAILLE (LCPO/IECB) research.
Sebastien Fribourg’s Group :
This group works on structural biology, the group leader let us use the sonicator to lyse our cultures before centrifugation, their different centrifuges and materials for protein production were very helpful.
Lionel Beaurepaire :
Lionel Beaurepaire is a research engineer he advised us on the production and purification protocol, in order to get more product. he was very helpful for us, he is the boss of production proteins
Axel Innis group :
The group led by Axel Innis (PhD) work on translational regulation of gene expression, Axel authorized us to use his lab equipment.
""The German Power"" Carolin SEEFELDT (Graduate student) and Britta SEIP (Post-doc) gave us a lot of helpful advices about protein precipitation.
Our nighbours from the lab near to us, helped us by lending us an incubator, some tips, centrifuge and giving us some piece of advice about electrophoresis.
Martin Teichmann group:
He is a professor at the University of and a researcher at the IECB. His work is based on Gene regulation & tumor research.
CRPP
For the transformation of our proteins into threads we collaborated with the Centre de Recherche Paul Pascal, which is located in the same campus as our lab.
We heard about their work on a TV report. We met two scientists there who helped us to elaborate a succesfull way to form our fiber.
The CRPP allowed to us to transform our proteins from liquid state to fiber, we characterized our product by using a machine allowing measurement of elasticity and resistance of polymers.
Wilfrid Neri :
Called “Spider Engineer” he is a chemistry Engineer (ITA CNRS) and works on production of nanocarbone fiber which could replace Kevlar one day !
Cecile Zakri :
Professor at Bordeaux University , and researcher at CRPP on nanotubes and graphene.
External organisms
GenScript GenScript sponsored us by offering us a synthesis. In parallel of our own synthesis, we asked them to synthesize two of our coding sequences (for BBa_K1317001 and BBa_K1317002).
We used these sequences to assemble the biobricks because it was sequenced, and so we could provide the registry with the proper sequence without mutations.

Attributions
iGEM Team attributions page
Each team must clearly attribute work done by the student team members on this page.  The team must distinguish work done by the students from work done by others, including the host labs, advisors, instructors, and individuals not on the team roster.
Why do we have this requirement?
Attribution Template
We have this requirement to help the judges know what you did yourselves and what you had help with. We don't mind if you get help with difficult or complex techniques, just be sure to report the work your team did and the work that was done by others.
For example, you might choose to work with an animal model during your project. Working with animals requires getting a license and applying far in advance to conduct certain experiments in many countries. This is something that is difficult to achieve during the course of a summer, but much easier if you can work with a postdoc or PI who has the right licenses.
A great example of complete attribution comes from the Imperial College London 2011 team (scroll down to the bottom of their team page to see attributions).
Here are some of the fields we recommend you have on this page. If there are other areas not listed below, but applicable to your team/project, please feel free to also list them on your attributions page. Please feel free to remove any areas not applicable to your project.

iGEM Team attributions page
Each team must clearly attribute work done by the student team members on this page.  The team must distinguish work done by the students from work done by others, including the host labs, advisors, instructors, and individuals not on the team roster.
Why do we have this requirement?
Attribution Template
We have this requirement to help the judges know what you did yourselves and what you had help with. We don't mind if you get help with difficult or complex techniques, just be sure to report the work your team did and the work that was done by others.
For example, you might choose to work with an animal model during your project. Working with animals requires getting a license and applying far in advance to conduct certain experiments in many countries. This is something that is difficult to achieve during the course of a summer, but much easier if you can work with a postdoc or PI who has the right licenses.
A great example of complete attribution comes from the Imperial College London 2011 team (scroll down to the bottom of their team page to see attributions).
Here are some of the fields we recommend you have on this page. If there are other areas not listed below, but applicable to your team/project, please feel free to also list them on your attributions page. Please feel free to remove any areas not applicable to your project.

Despite the hard work, long days and persistence of the team, the project would never have come this far without the help, and support, of all the amazing people with whom we have worked together this summer.
Thereby, we first and foremost want to extend our truest gratitude to our supervisors, whose guidance and patience never failed to inspire and aid us in times of need.
Verena Siewers
David Jullesson
Eugene Fletcher
In addition, we are very grateful to Andreas Lindhé who did all of the javascript work for the wiki. Without you, code both visible and invisible would be much uglier (and probably nonfunctional).
We would also like to thank our sponsors. Without them this journey would never have been possible. Big thanks to:
Chalmers University of technology
The Systems and Synthetic Biology group and Jens Nielsen
We also greatly appreciated the questions and opinions, as well as some fun days, from our fellow iGEMers. Thereby we would also like to thank the rest of the Swedish iGEM teams. Many hugs to:
Uppsala University iGEM
Linköping University iGEM
Furthermore, we enjoyed every day in the lab and thus we want to thank all the people whom we have met and talked to throughout the summer. With their help and friendly attitude we were able to feel at home from day one.
Thanks for the cake guys!

Feng Yu
Brief Introduction
feng_yu@hnu.edu.cn
Dr. Yu is one of the youngest faculties in the College of Biology at Hunan University, as the Associate Professor with his excellent study in the plant kinase FERONIA during the plants development and stress response. He has provided us a bench in the lab as well as labortaroy equipment and supplies, and given us instructions in the specific operation.
Our University
Hunan University is situated at the foot of the picturesque Yuelu Mountain and on the west bank of the rippling Xiangjiang River in the historically and culturally renowned City of Changsha, capital of Hunan Province. It enjoys the title of an ""Ancient Millenarian Academy, Famous Centennial University"". As one of the key and most comprehensive universities affiliated with the Ministry of Education, it has been included in the state's ""Project 211"" and ""Project 985"" for priority investment and construction.Professor Liu Keli is the Party Secretary of the CPC Hunan University Committee and Professor Zhao Yueyu the President of this highly reputed institute.
Hunan University, an extension of one of the four famous Academies of the Song Dynasty, dates back to the period of the founding of Yuelu Academy in 976 AD. The university has maintained the glorious culture and education standards inherited from the historical institute in the process of the numerous changes faced with during the Song, Yuan, Ming and Qing dynasties. It was reconstructed into Hunan Institute of Higher Learning in 1903, renamed Hunan University in 1926, and subordinated to the Republic of China's Ministry of Education as one of several state universities in 1937. After liberation and the founding of the People's Republic of China, the Central People's Government appointed Li Da, a well-known philosopher and educator, as the first President of Hunan University. Chairman Mao Zedong inscribed the name of the University. In 1953, when readjusting China’s higher education institutions, Hunan University was named the Central-South Institute of Civil Engineering. Later it was renamed Hunan Polytechnic College, and was finally, named Hunan University in 1959. Since 1963, the University has been affiliated with the Ministry of Mechanical Industry and in 1978 it was approved as a key and comprehensive university of China, and became directly affiliated with the Ministry of Education in 1998. In 2000, Hunan University and Hunan Institute of Finance and Economics merged to give shape to a new wide-ranging Hunan University.
Carrying forward the celebrated traditions of quality education and personnel cultivation, Hunan University continues to focus on the essence of its motto ""Seeking Truth from Facts; Daring to be Pioneers"" and the style of ""Be Profound, Intelligent, Diligent and Dedicated in the Pursuit of Knowledge"". It has adopted distinctive teaching style featuring ""solid foundation, active thinking, strong adaptability, and good comprehensive quality"". Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, the university has produced more than 200,000 senior professionals, of whom large numbers of the graduates have grown into academic experts, entrepreneurs and high ranking officials in government and private sectors, while 16 alumni members have been elected as members of the Chinese Academy of Science and the Chinese Academy of Engineering. The employment rate of the fresh graduates keeps a record of over 90%.

Tamara Kleiman
I am a computer science specialist, but was a member of the wet lab team this year! (makes sense) My interests in bio lie within the field of epigenetics - specifically questions like how DNA methylation is inheritable and chromatin remodelling. Fun fact: I have a pet poodle named Rocky which people find hilarious for some reason.
Nadia Stec
I was part of the wet lab team this summer and am probably the team member most afraid of sybrsafe (or the only one). Having just started my 4th year in life sciences and being a first time iGEM-er, I really enjoyed learning about the applications of a plasmid-loss system. I love coffee and puns, and trying to miniprep faster than the previous time.
Afiq Asri
4th year undergraduate | Biomedical Engineering
Kuala Lumpur-born Afiq is happy to return to iGEM Toronto team for a 2nd year, designing Biobricks and delivering synbio workshops for human practices. He loves microfluidics, analytical chemistry, citizen science and open-source things.  Outside the scientific habitat, Afiq can be found reading Thought Catalog, arguing which anime were best written, or over-contemplating graduate school.
Cathy Su
I am in third year studying Biological Physics at UofT. This year, I've been mainly involved with fundraising for iGem Toronto. I'm really grateful for the chance to be part of this interdisciplinary team and for the generosity of the people and departments at UofT who have supported us.
Veronica Lei
Third Year, Majors:Human Biology: Health and Disease, Cells and Systems Biology
Bohan XIng
I am studying biological physics and neuroscience at U of T. I am expecting to graduate in 2016. I worked mainly on modeling part and I also did some wet lab experiment. It is a great experience to compete at iGEM.
Samantha Chow
Samantha is the President of the U of T iGEM team this year. She is currently in her final year of Engineering Science specializing in Biomedical Systems Engineering. In her free time, she enjoys long walks through the lab, and being sophisticated and cultured among plates of bacteria.
Charlotte Michelle Nguyen
Charlotte wakes up to a steaming bowl of homemade pho. For lunch she eats a double cheeseburger (she is lactose intolerant but it’s not real cheese), a junior chicken, 6 Mcnuggets, and small fries with mayonnaise. Dinner is sushi! She eats chicken katsu don, salmon sashimi, an unagi roll, a spicy chopped scallop roll, green salad, and a side of spicy mayonnaise. This is Charlotte’s perfect day. She worked on fundraising for iGEM.
Xiuqi (Rex) Xia
I am in third year doing a Specialist program in Integrative Biology at U of T's Scarborough campus. I'm also doing a Minor in Computer Science which tbh was mostly so I could understand the jokes in xkcd. I came up with the idea for this year's project and was project lead for the research team. I probably don't sleep enough, but I make up for it by napping during my long commutes between campuses and my home in far suburbia.
Carrie Huang
I am studying molecular genetics at University of Toronto. My passion is everything related to biology (love analyzing what is living inside my lunch, for example)! I am part of human practices team in this year's iGem project. You probably won't spot me as often on Campus cuz I love staying in my cosy room and drawing colorful biology diagram (COLOR is the key!!!)
Jialun Chen
Jialun is our lab manager this year. He is currently in his 3rd year, specializing in Pathobiology. In his free time, he enjoy reading Japanese crime fictions. Arisugawa Arisu is his favourite writer.
Matthew Paolucci
I studied mathematics, molecular genetics and microbiology and I was a member of the wet lab team this year.  I am especially interested in 3D organic printers (they exist?!?!) and chaotic systems. I enjoyed the learning experience that I gained from working with this years IGEM team and look forward to reading about all the Nobel prizes that the members of this team will surely acquire - one day. Fun fact: I once dribbled a basketball with my knees for over a km to get out of detention!
Jing Guo
I am a fourth year student at U of T, double majoring in Human Biology and Economics. I was responsible for coordinating Human Practice projects. I was also a part of the wet-lab team. It’s amazing to be able to work along side of so many talented and dedicated people!
Julian Mazzitelli
I am a second year bioinformatics student at U of T. I'm very interested in the web as a technology to distribute media in novel ways. I volunteered to design the website for the team during last year's general meeting, and since then I have been the webmaster for the team. I haven't done any wet lab work - but I'd like to one summer!
Te Chen
I am a fourth year bioinformatics student at U of T. I was responsible for modeling part of the project.

TU Eindhoven iGEM Team
TU Eindhoven iGEM Team 2014
Tom de Greef
My name is Anke Boschman and I will take on the role of lab captain, meaning I will be responsible for all the exciting experiments we will perform in the wet lab.  Together with Glenn, the modelling captain, I will keep an overview of all the tasks and information and we will schedule and organize the team meetings.  At the moment, I’m a second year student at the Eindhoven University of Technology. I’m enrolled in the bachelor Biomedical Engineering. I joined this year’s iGEM team because I like to challenge myself and I believed iGEM would be a really nice challenge since it combines the field of synthetic biology with model based engineering. I also liked the fact that you would be able to conduct your own research during a team project. Moreover, I’m curious whether full time lab work would suit me and iGEM seemed like the opportunity to get in touch with this kind of work. I hope that after bringing this iGEM project successfully to an end, I have acquired some nice skills that I’m able to apply often in my future activities. In the future, I hope I will be enjoying executing scientific research – although I do not yet know whether this will be in the field of synthetic biology.
e-mail me
Bas Bögels - PR
My name is Bas Bögels and I’m the team’s jack of all trades, doing lab work but also assisting the modelling team, and doing the external communications. I’m currently in the second year of the bachelor Biomedical Engineering at the Eindhoven University of Technology. I joined the iGEM team, because I wanted to work on a large project which wasn’t already done at our university (or elsewhere) and learn to do scientific research and plan your own project. Also I’m using iGEM to determine if the field of synthetic engineering is something I would like to specialize in. After iGEM I hope to have learned how to do my own research and hopefully decided if this field is something I would like to study further.
e-mail me
Boris Arts - Sponsoring
My name is Boris Arts and I’m part of the modelling team. Next to my main role, I make sure all expenses will be covered by enlisting sponsors. Currently I’m a third year student studying Biomedical Engineering at the Eindhoven University of Technology. I joined the iGEM team to do research in the field of synthetic biology because this is one of my areas of interest. Also I think it is a good way to experience how to build a research from the ground up and to apply everything you learned during the courses to the real world. After iGEM I will continue studying in the field of biomedical chemistry and biomaterials, focusing on designing new materials used for tissue engineering and pharmaceuticals.
e-mail me
Wiggert Altenburg - Lab Nanny
My name is Wiggert Altenburg and I work mainly doing lab work and research.  I study Medical Sciences and Technology at the Eindhoven University of Technology. I joined the iGEM team because it is a great opportunity and I think it is awesome to fully realize a whole research project while we’re all still students. After iGEM I want to do a Master and PhD in the field of Chemical Biology.

Anke Boschman - Organisation of Project
I have taken on the role of lab captain, meaning I am responsible for all the exciting experiments we perform in the wet lab. Together with Glenn, the modeling captain, I keep an overview of all the tasks and organize the team meetings. At the moment, I am a third year student at the Eindhoven University of Technology. I am enrolled in the bachelor Biomedical Engineering. I joined this year’s iGEM team because I like to challenge myself and I believed iGEM would be a really nice challenge since it combines the field of synthetic biology with model based engineering. Moreover, I hope that after I complete this iGEM project successfully I have acquired some nice skills that I am able to apply often in my future activities.
E-mail Me
Bas Bögels - SPAAC Click Reaction Analysis, RCA
I am the team’s jack of all trades, doing lab work but also assisting the modeling team, and doing the external communications. I am currently in the third year of the bachelor Biomedical Engineering at the Eindhoven University of Technology. I joined the iGEM team, because I wanted to work on a large project which was not already done at our university (or elsewhere) and learn to do scientific research and plan your own project. Also I am using iGEM to determine if the field of synthetic engineering is something I would like to specialize in. After iGEM I hope to have learned how to do my own research and hopefully decided if this field is something I would like to study further.
E-mail Me
Boris Arts - Sponsoring, Microfluidics
Currently I am a fourth year student studying Biomedical Engineering at the Eindhoven University of Technology. I joined the iGEM team to do research in the field of synthetic biology because this is one of my areas of interest. Also I think it is a good way to experience how to build a research from the ground up and to apply everything you learned during the courses to the real world. After iGEM I will continue studying in the field of biomedical chemistry and biomaterials, focusing on designing new materials used for tissue engineering and pharmaceuticals.
E-mail Me
Bram Somers - Policy & Practices, BioBricking
I am helping with the sponsoring, the wiki page and the lab work. Like most of us, I study Biomedical Engineering at the Eindhoven University of Technology and I am currently in my third year. My main reason for joining the team is because it seemed like a lot of fun. I wanted to gain more knowledge and skills on conducting research and iGEM could provide me with that. After iGEM I will most probably start working on my Bachelor End Project in the field of Protein Engineering. Furthermore, I will be giving the final presentations during the Giant Jamboree in Boston.
E-mail Me
Glenn Cremers - Modeling, Construction Creation, BioBricking
I am the captain of the modeling team. I am responsible for all the modeling that needs to be done in the project. I am currently a third year student enrolled in the bachelor Biomedical Engineering at the Eindhoven University of Technology. I joined the iGEM team, because I wanted to work on a challenging project which has not been done before allowing us to create our own project and the experiments we are going to do.  Also I am using iGEM to determine if the modeling part combined with the field of synthetic engineering is something I would like to specialize in. After iGEM I hope to have learned how to do my own research and experiments, and hopefully I will be able to decide if this field is something I would like to continue with.
E-mail Me
Lenne Lemmens - Characterization of the System
My focus is on the lab work. I am currently in the second year of the master Biomedical Engineering in the field of chemical biology at the Eindhoven University of Technology.

I recently started my graduation project in the exciting field of chemical biology.
E-mail Me
Leroy Tan - Lab Safety, Microfluidics
I am the safety expert in the iGEM team: I am responsible for the safety in the laboratory. I am also part of the microfluidics team. Currently I am a third year bachelor student of Biomedical Engineering at the Eindhoven University of Technology.  I joined the iGEM team, because my interest goes to synthetic biology and I like to work in a team. The iGEM competition gives a great opportunity to combine this and it is instructive for both the theoretical part as the work in the lab. It will give me a lot of experience. After iGEM I want to receive my degree in Biomedical Engineering and I want to engineer innovative ideas.
E-mail Me
Melissa van de Pasch - SPAAC Click Reaction Analysis, RCA

iGEM Team attributions page
Each team must clearly attribute work done by the student team members on this page.  The team must distinguish work done by the students from work done by others, including the host labs, advisors, instructors, and individuals not on the team roster.
Why do we have this requirement?
Attribution Template
We have this requirement to help the judges know what you did yourselves and what you had help with. We don't mind if you get help with difficult or complex techniques, just be sure to report the work your team did and the work that was done by others.
For example, you might choose to work with an animal model during your project. Working with animals requires getting a license and applying far in advance to conduct certain experiments in many countries. This is something that is difficult to achieve during the course of a summer, but much easier if you can work with a postdoc or PI who has the right licenses.
A great example of complete attribution comes from the Imperial College London 2011 team (scroll down to the bottom of their team page to see attributions).
Here are some of the fields we recommend you have on this page. If there are other areas not listed below, but applicable to your team/project, please feel free to also list them on your attributions page. Please feel free to remove any areas not applicable to your project.

TU Eindhoven iGEM Team 2014
Anke Boschman - Lab Captain
My name is Anke Boschman and I will take on the role of lab captain, meaning I will be responsible for all the exciting experiments we will perform in the wet lab.  Together with Glenn, the modelling captain, I will keep an overview of all the tasks and information and we will schedule and organize the team meetings.  At the moment, I’m a second year student at the Eindhoven University of Technology. I’m enrolled in the bachelor Biomedical Engineering. I joined this year’s iGEM team because I like to challenge myself and I believed iGEM would be a really nice challenge since it combines the field of synthetic biology with model based engineering. I also liked the fact that you would be able to conduct your own research during a team project. Moreover, I’m curious whether full time lab work would suit me and iGEM seemed like the opportunity to get in touch with this kind of work. I hope that after bringing this iGEM project successfully to an end, I have acquired some nice skills that I’m able to apply often in my future activities. In the future, I hope I will be enjoying executing scientific research – although I do not yet know whether this will be in the field of synthetic biology.

Elias Augestad
I was finishing my third year in the Master Program in Biotechnology at NTNU in Trondheim, when I joined the iGEM team. My education has so far consisted of courses in molecular biology and chemistry. I have now moved to Denmark where I have started on my master degree in Biotechnology at the University of Copenhagen.
I joined the iGEM team with some knowledge of the principles behind synthetic biology, but I knew little about what kind of methods and techniques that were used. I feel now that I have learned a lot, both theoretically and practically, from this project and I´m really glad I got the opportunity to be part of NTNU´s iGEM team 2014.
Ronja Hesthammer
I joined the NTNU iGEM team as I was finishing my Master’s degree in Biotechnology. My specialization was biopolymer chemistry, however, my thesis was on characterizing of enzymes produced by micro-organisms in oil reservoirs. I have now moved to Bergen, a different city in Norway, and started my Ph.D. at the University of Bergen (UiB). My research here focuses on tetrahydrobiopterin as a key factor in the pathophysiology of diving.
The project our team chose to work with is of great importance in our society today, and I’m very glad to be a part of it. I have gotten to practice several methods during this iGEM participation, and learned some new ones. It has also been very exciting to work with the rest of the team members of our small, but extremely nice team.
Pål Røynestad
I joined the NTNU iGEM team towards the end of my third year of NTNU's 5 year integrated master's degree program in Biotechnology. I am now in my fourth year, and have just started working on my master's thesis. My thesis involves developing a new genome-scale metabolic modelling approach to study patterns of adaptation when using a massively-parallel experimental evolution platform.
Going into the project, my knowledge of iGEM and synthetic biology was limited, but the learning experience has been very rewarding, even with all the frustration involved.
Camilla Marstrander Reehorst
I completed my Master of Science degree in 2014 at Norwegian University of Science and Technology located in Trondheim. My specialisation was biopolymer chemistry and the focus of my master thesis was drug penetration and bioavailability through the mucus barrier. My main research area interest is medical biotechnology. I have now moved to Melbourne, Australia, and will hopefully commence a PhD at the University of Melbourne within the medical field from the start of 2015.
In relation to my focus area, the iGEM project has been rather peripheral; however, I have enjoyed the new techniques and experiences. I also think that as a researcher it pays off to have an basic understanding about the mechanics of multiple research areas, not only the one you’ve submerged yourself in.
Eivind Bøe Drejer
I'm currently finishing my master's degree in Biotechnology, specializing in Systems Biology. My master thesis involves metabolic modelling of Salmonella enterica during osmotic stress, and is done in collaboration with the Institute for Food Research in Norwich, UK. I have been interested in science from an early age, and settled on biotechnology in 2010. Synthetic biology has fascinated me ever since I started understanding the complex dynamics that govern cells. Being able to design new functions for living cells is a testimony to how far the science has come, and I am proud to play a small part in it.
Working on designing an expression system for Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 has been exciting and educating. I have thoroughly enjoyed the iGEM experience so far, and can't wait to see what the other teams have accomplished.
Line Aanerud Omtvedt
I finished my Master of Science degree in Biotechnology at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU) in June 2014. My specialization was biopolymer chemistry, and I worked extensively with alginate in my master project. In October I started my Ph.D. at the same university. My Ph.D. research is about the modification of marine polysaccharides and biomaterials, under the MARPOL group.
The research done with iGEM has been a great learning experience for me, as synthetic biology is not a research field I have focused on before. I think it is very important to gain insight into different areas of science, and feel that iGEM has greatly contributed to this.  I am very happy I got the opportunity to participate in the 2014 iGEM competition.
Jacob Lamb
I started my research in a laboratory at the University of Otago in Dunedin, New Zealand with Professor Julian Eaton-Rye and Associate Professor Martin Hohmann-Marriott. I completed of my Master of Science degree in 2012 in the field of Biochemistry, focusing on renewable energy studies in photosynthetic organisms. I then moved to Trondheim, Norway to undertake a Ph.D. research fellowship under the supervision of Associate Professor Martin Hohmann-Marriott in the department of Biotechnology, at NTNU. My Ph.D. research looks at using cyanobacteria (and other photosynthetic organisms) as a source of energy/biofuels.
As a consequence, this iGEM project our team has undertaken is of up-most interest for me personally, as I believe that photosynthesis holds the solution to a lot of the problems our society will face in the coming years.
HyeWon Lee
I graduated NTNU with my undergraduate program in biopolymerchemistry and master thesis in biopolymerphysics. I moved back to my home country in the summer, and am now working in the R&D department of a pharmaceutical company, Greencross corp..
It was unfortunate that O could only join the  iGEM team for a short period. I am very proud of our team and wish them all the best of luck for the jamboree.
Instructors
Rahmi Lale - Microbial Biotechnology
I have obtained my PhD degree in 2009, within the field of microbial biotechnology. Currently, I am working as a researcher at the Department of Biotechnology, NTNU.
My main research focus areas are bacterial transcriptional and translational regulation, synthetic biology/metabolic engineering and metagenome/biodiscovery.
I have been working with various organisms including E. coli, mesophilic and psychrophilic Pseudomonas sp., Streptomyces sp, Shewanella sp., Pseudoalteromonas sp., Synechocystis sp., lactic acid bacteria, and yeast.
Prof. Eivind Almaas - Systems- and network biology
During the last few years, network approaches have shown great promise as new tools to analyze and understand complex systems. In biology, network formulations of a system naturally appear in situations ranging from food webs in ecology to biochemical interactions in molecular biology. In particular in the cell, the variety of interactions between genes, proteins and metabolites are well captured by a complex network description. My research is focused on developing both general and specific methods to understand the principles behind the design and organization of biological systems.
There is close connection between systems and synthetic biology, and the iGEM competition is a natural arena to explore this tight relationship.
Assoc. Prof. Martin F. Hohmann-Marriott - Photosynthesis and bioenergetics
Research interests:
Photosynthesis & bioenergetics
Ecosystem-scale energy generation
Renewable energy
Nano-scale imaging techniques
Evolution of bioenergetic systems & Astrobiology

iGEM Team attributions page
Each team must clearly attribute work done by the student team members on this page.  The team must distinguish work done by the students from work done by others, including the host labs, advisors, instructors, and individuals not on the team roster.
Why do we have this requirement?
Attribution Template
We have this requirement to help the judges know what you did yourselves and what you had help with. We don't mind if you get help with difficult or complex techniques, just be sure to report the work your team did and the work that was done by others.
For example, you might choose to work with an animal model during your project. Working with animals requires getting a license and applying far in advance to conduct certain experiments in many countries. This is something that is difficult to achieve during the course of a summer, but much easier if you can work with a postdoc or PI who has the right licenses.
A great example of complete attribution comes from the Imperial College London 2011 team (scroll down to the bottom of their team page to see attributions).
Here are some of the fields we recommend you have on this page. If there are other areas not listed below, but applicable to your team/project, please feel free to also list them on your attributions page. Please feel free to remove any areas not applicable to your project.

iGEM Team attributions page
Each team must clearly attribute work done by the student team members on this page.  The team must distinguish work done by the students from work done by others, including the host labs, advisors, instructors, and individuals not on the team roster.
Why do we have this requirement?
Attribution Template
We have this requirement to help the judges know what you did yourselves and what you had help with. We don't mind if you get help with difficult or complex techniques, just be sure to report the work your team did and the work that was done by others.
For example, you might choose to work with an animal model during your project. Working with animals requires getting a license and applying far in advance to conduct certain experiments in many countries. This is something that is difficult to achieve during the course of a summer, but much easier if you can work with a postdoc or PI who has the right licenses.
A great example of complete attribution comes from the Imperial College London 2011 team (scroll down to the bottom of their team page to see attributions).
Here are some of the fields we recommend you have on this page. If there are other areas not listed below, but applicable to your team/project, please feel free to also list them on your attributions page. Please feel free to remove any areas not applicable to your project.
General Support
Project support and advice
Fundraising help and advice
Lab support
Difficult technique support
Project advisor support
Wiki support
Presentation coaching
Policy & Practices support
Thanks and acknowledgements for all other people involved in helping make a successful iGEM team.

CHO Haemin
2nd year, BSc in Biotechnology
Haemin is a second year student majoring in Biotechnology. She is one of the two leaders of this year HKUST iGEM team. In the lab, she works diligently and is very helpful when needed. But most of the time, she looks blank-minded and often makes small careless mistakes. Her trademark quote is ""What did I just do? *blank face*
JOO Min Jung
2nd year, BSc in Biochemistry and Cell Biology
""What should be our team name... Pneutella? Pneutorious? ...Finding Pneumo!! Wait, let me draw a fish :)""
AW Jacqueline Theeng Mei
2nd year, BSc in Biochemistry and Cell Biology
Jacqueline is a year two student majoring in Biochemistry and Cell Biology. Apart from being a junior member in iGEM team, she is also the secretary of the team. Claiming to have above-standard laboratory skills, she performed various kinds of experiments. Quite often, she will work in the laboratory from 9am to 6pm. Unsurprisingly, she likes to attend every meeting and make reminders and minutes for every meeting. EVERY MEETING! (To those who don’t read her emails, be careful). Enjoying iGEM competition, she likes to perform site directed mutagenesis and Gibson assembly daily. Rapping is one of her precious abilities as well as stalking others. Indeed she is the number ONE stalker in the team. Although she tried very hard to shed this title, the fact that she is a stalker will not change.
CHAN Yuk Pui Alfie
3rd year, BSc in Biochemistry and Cell Biology
Alfie has done so much for the team and to the lab. He also had a particular affection to the centrifuge. He loved it so much that he sometimes SLAMMED the cover to make sure it’s closed, then Raul would be jealous and said ""DON’T SLAM THE CENTRIFUGE!"" *Hmm... I wonder why the centrifuge got replaced* Alfie also liked the newly replaced centrifuge. He put smaller tubes than required- maybe thinking the big tubes were too heavy for the centrifuge, but he had to take care of the mess of broken tubes and split DNA inside the centrifuge. Lastly, he worked as a great team manager, and helped out the whole team by transferring to many different teams.
MAHANADI Albert
2nd year, BSc in Biotechnology
Albert is a gentleman who cares about other people. He is one of the two people in charge of Human Practice group. Funny random thing about him: he likes to play games in the lab. He is Indonesian but he learned how to say bad words in Korean. So be careful when he starts speaking in Korean!
KIM Hye Ji
2nd year, BSc in Business and Management
Hye Ji is a sweet, soft-spoken girl who works mainly on human practice but helps out in the lab as well. She is the matchmaker of the team. She makes the other girls play 'Ideal Type World Cup' to find their best match in the iGEM team. Rumour has it that she also gives free relationship advice on the side.
TANG Tsz Ching Chloe
2nd year, BSc in Biochemistry and Cell Biology
Chloe is a second year student from Hong Kong taking her major in Biochemistry and Cell Biology. She is the PIC of the second group of the team. She is in charge of assigning and coordinating the group work. Other than that, Chloe is also competing with Jacqueline to be the number one stalker in the team; but up to this day, she has not been recognized as such, and ranked only third. Favorite quote: ""I don't like colony PCR, so I make my groupmates do it hehe""
GOTAMA Rinaldi
2nd year, BSc in Biological Sciences
Rinaldi is from Indonesia. He is really good at photoshop and graphic design and is in charge of the graphic design team. He is famous for coming up with wacky names for the team and other team members. He is also famous for his shouting matches with Chloe in the lab. He tries to be serious and fierce at times but we all know that he is a softie at heart.
HAN Gyucheol James
2nd year, BSc in Biotechnology
James is very tall and like to dance. He often wears a cap to the lab and classes. He is very friendly and open to everyone, and want to befriend with anybody. He is a very calm person that never complains, and always does what he wants. His life seems very simple and uncomplicated.
TONG Guillaume Huiming
2nd year, BEng in Computer Engineering
Guillaume is also known as William. He is a sophomore majoring in Computer Engineering and responsible for coding the Wiki page.  Although he majors in a subject unrelated to biology, he is very keen to learn about synthetic biology in iGEM. His ultimate goal is to build a cyborg! He loves woodcarving, baking, and playing violin.
SULAIMAN Jordy Evan
2nd year, BEng in Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering
Jordy is a year two student majoring in Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering. He is hard-working, diligent, and creative. He likes to eat, play basketball, and play computer games. Above all, he likes Doyle the most. Though Jordy is very funny, sometimes he can be extremely serious when doing something. The scary part of Jordy is that he is good at everything, even arts. Everyone likes Jordy.
WIDJAJA Angeline
2nd year, BEng in Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering
Angie is the angel of iGEM. She is a cheerful girl who likes to work but also have fun at the same time. She loves to play basketball and play games with other people. She is excellent at making friends. There's nothing bad about her except for her spontaneous randomness. But that characteristic of hers is what makes iGEM fun in some way or another. Interesting and unique people are the ones who everyone should cherish.
BONGSO Nadia Benedicta
2nd year, BEng in Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering
She is one of the rare team members that do not major in Life Science, she is a year 2 student majoring Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering (but still, biology is involved). She is one of the 3-man Indonesian gang, which contributes to most of the noise in lab. She is indeed very helpful in the lab, such as helping to fill boxes of tips just after a few hours she landed in HK. She also helped much in Human Practice work. She is quite absent-minded about her iPad, luckily she does not forget her lab work. She LOVES people calling her surname, and she really likes Hong Kong Disneyland.
SUH Joseph
2nd year, BSc in Biochemistry and Cell Biology
Joseph is a second year student majoring Biochemistry and Cell Biology from South Korea. He is one of the two people in charge of Human Practice group.  He is incapable of waking up early in the morning which is why he always gets the afternoon shift for doing the lab works. He likes playing music and eating sushi. Above all, Joseph is very funny and really like goofing around with the other members.
JANG Sang Jin Jason
2nd year, BSc in Biochemistry and Cell Biology
Jason is a second year student majoring in Biochemistry and Cell Biology. He is from Korea but he spent most of his life in Singapore. He contributed to module 2 by using ""educated guess"" to figure out the gene sequence of combox. He is in the wiki team and contributes to build up the wiki page website.
NG Siu Wang Edward
2nd year, BSc in Biotechnology
Edward is known as a hardworking and diligent lab worker (or lover), that his passion has been our treasure. But everyone also remembered that Edward put 30μl of DNA ladder instead of 1μl when he ran a gel. I guess every newbie has made their own stupid mistakes. Even though he presented himself as nice as possible in front of everyone, he is really mean and snarky when he is speaking in Cantonese!
CUELLAR Raul M.
3rd year, BSc in Biological Sciences
Raul is a third year student majoring in Biological Sciences. He is one of our two senior members this year. He seems very intimidating at first but once you get to know him, he will joke around you until you are annoyed. He is also one of the busiest and most patient person in the lab, doing lab tasks and answering everyone's questions at the same time. Warning: when he starts telling one of his PBAD jokes... RUN FOR YOUR LIVES!!
LEE Jihwan
3rd year, BSc in Molecular Biomedical Sciences
Jihwan is one of the two senior members of our iGEM team. This is his second year of participation, and he devotes much of his time and efforts into bringing the riboregulator project to a success. He kindly provides help and advice to us as an experienced senior. Being all-rounded in both academic and non-academic pursuits, he is the role model for inspiring the younger minds of our team to strive for excellence.
CHEUNG Ming Fung Eric
2nd year, BSc in Biochemistry and Cell Biology
Ming Fung, or Eric, is not only a second year student majoring in Biochemistry and Cell Biology, but also a computer guru who helps in coding our wiki page. Being calm and serious are two of his conspicuous traits. He is a diligent, responsible and obliging person and you will find him very comfortable to work with once you get to know him. Although he looks serious, sometimes he gives hilarious one-liners that makes everyone in the lab laugh out loud.
PARK Hojeong Bonnie
2nd year, BSc in Biochemistry and Cell Biology
Hojeong, or Bonnie, is a sophomore in Biochemistry and Cell Biology, and Chemistry (YES, she majors in BOTH). She loves cats, and she is simply the most artistic person in the whole team. She often takes her passion regarding cats and art to another level, and overwhelms people with her perks and quirkiness. Sometimes, she even labels herself as a 'cat'. She meows constantly in the lab for 'luck'.

Team
Glen Gowers
(3rd year Biochemist, University College)
The guy who makes everything happen, the Fred to our iGEM ""Mystery Machine"". When Glen isn't sailing around the country, he's hard at work in the lab and at the desk.
Glen's LinkedIn profile
Jack Hoffman
(3rd year Chemist, St John's College)
Though prodigious in his own field, Jack’s curiosity and fervour for a wide range of academic disciplines has allowed him to contribute to the team effort many different aspects. In particular, his design and synthesis of biopolymer capsules is not only a major contribution to the realisation of our project, but represents a novel bacterial containment system applicable to many fields of research. He is in charge of the realisation aspect of our project and has been working closely with our engineers to design mathematical frameworks for our modelling. Furthermore,  he has led our web page development and graphics.
Corinna Oswald
(3rd year Biochemist, St John's College)
Corinna is one of the founding members that organised Oxford’s first participation in iGEM, and was a key player in conceptualising our project 'DCMation'.
In between perfecting the Viennese Waltz and denying that Austrians are always yodeling in the Alps (which we refuse to accept), she works reliably hard and efficient to ensure that both her and the entire team's work is completed to the highest standards. Her organisational and communication skills secure the smooth running of the project despite ever-increasing time pressure and the broadly interdisciplinary nature of our team.
contact: oswald.corinna@gmail.com
Corinna's LinkedIn profile
Andy Russell
(3rd year Biochemist, The Queen's College)
Andy is one of the founding members of Oxford’s first iGEM team. As well as having an avid interest in synthetic biology he has also worked in the field of cancer research. Andy is now entering his third year as a biochemist at The Queen's College, where he is an accomplished sportsman.
Contact: Andrew.Russell@Queens.ox.ac.uk
Andy's LinkedIn profile
Siân McGibbon
(3rd year Lawyer, University College)
Siân is the model lawyer along with everything that implies.
She has led the Policy and Practices element of our project, with a particular emphasis on intellectual property policy and its role in shaping the developing field of synthetic biology. Siân has a particular interest in this area of law, and the key role it will play in determining the future of genetic technology and in many other branches of science.
In addition, Siân has been involved in the development of the website (particularly though not exclusively the human practices pages) and has worked with Francesca to organize a wide range of outreach and engagement events.
After engaging with a wide range of audiences on multiple occasions during the course of the project, Siân will be presenting our project and her intellectual property policy research to a worldwide audience of experts, competitors, and judges at the Hynes Convention Centre in Boston.
Tim Ang
(3rd year Biologist, St John's College)
Tim's primary academic interests focus on evolutionary theory, particularly social evolution. A keen weightlifter, his frequent references to weights and protein shakes naturally make him the hub of enchanting conversation here at Oxford iGEM.
Tim is in charge of our interlab study and poster.
Emily Prichett
(3rd year Biochemist, University College)
Emily has been the latest addition to our team and turned out to be absolutely crucial for our entire social media activities. She loves the E.coli chat and has been a well-renown expert beyond the iGEM teams on growth curves and methylotrophs.
Philipp Lorenz
(3rd year Biochemist, University College)
It was Phil's idea to bring iGEM to Oxford, and he continues to ensure our project runs as smoothly as a German train schedule.
Phil's LinkedIn profile
Fran Donellan
(3rd year Biochemist, Oriel College)
Not just a member of the biochemist team but also leading our public engagement activities, no task is too big or small for Fran. This girl can provide sandwiches for 500 people at 24 hours' notice and look good doing it.
Shahbano Soomro
(3rd year PPEist, University College)
A third year student in Politics and Economics at University College, Shahbano has a particular interest in Environmental policy and philosophy. As well as helping Fran with organising our public engagement and events, she will be watching over our project from afar during the summer.
Matthew Booth
(3rd year Engineer, St John's College)
Matt is an avid Rugby player, having recently achieved great success with the college team. His main contributions to iGEM have been developing the light detecting electrical circuit and the stochastic model for mCherry expression.
Oliver Vince
(3rd year Engineer, University College)
Oliver is our keenest team member - nothing can douse his motivation. In addition to taking charge of the maths and software, he feels responsible for our entertainment and has kept us amused both inside the lab and out.
Oliver has led the modeling of the genetic circuits. He has also been responsible for the development of our prototype design using CAD/CAM and 3D printing technology, and has played a leading role in the construction of our website pages. As the first engineer to work on the project, Oliver has been instrumental in bridging the gap between the science disciplines involved, as well as working closely with the policy and practices team on realization and practicality of our design.
After presenting to various audiences on several occasions during the course of our project, Oliver will present Oxford iGEM's modeling work in Boston at the jamboree next month.
Leroy Lim
(3rd year Engineer, St John's College)
During term, Leroy indulges in many of the quirks of Oxford life, namely rowing, bops and colourful trousers. During iGEM, he's our engineer and self-appointed social sec.
Supervisors
Dr George Wadhams
George Wadhams’ research interests lie in how bacteria sense and integrate environmental information. His group focuses on understanding in a quantitative manner how multiple, homologous pathways operate in individual cells and how the components of these pathways can be used to create synthetic pathways.
Dr Ciarán Kelly
Ciarán Kelly obtained a PhD for his work in Frank Sargant’s group, constructing and characterising synthetic biohydrogen production pathways in E. coli. He is interested in the construction, characterisation, and re-engineering synthetic enzymes and pathways for the production of high-value chemicals.
Mr Karl Brune
Karl Brune's research interests lie in elucidating metabolic pathways. His previous work at Imperial College London was focused on engineering microbial consortia to enhance biomining and bioremediation, as well as on the study of photoautotrophic organisms.
Advisors
Professor Judy Armitage
Judy Armitage is interested in the dynamics of bacterial sensory transduction and the control of bacterial motility. In particular, her research group focuses on the communication between the sensory and adaption mechanisms of the two pathways as a model for sensory network integration in general..
Professor Anthony Watts
Anthony Watts’ group is devising solid state NMR methods for determining high-resolution details of information-rich sites within membrane receptors. Recent focus has been on the neurotensin receptor (NTS1), which is now available highly purified and monodispersed in detergent as well as in a ligand-binding form.
Professor Antonis Papachristodoulou
Antonis Papachristodoulou’s research interests include systems and synthetic biology, network systems, aerospace systems and flow control, and convex optimisation. Furthermore, he works on modern control theory, robust stability analysis and design, as well as nonlinear dynamical systems and Lyapunov stability.
Andreas Harris
Andreas Harris works on the design and implementation of gene regulatory networks harnessing feedback to increase robustness and tunability. The designs are based around transcriptional networks and attempt to translate well-understood control modules, such as proportional and integral controllers, to biological systems.

Attributions
iGEM Team attributions page
Each team must clearly attribute work done by the student team members on this page.  The team must distinguish work done by the students from work done by others, including the host labs, advisors, instructors, and individuals not on the team roster.
Why do we have this requirement?
Attribution Template
We have this requirement to help the judges know what you did yourselves and what you had help with. We don't mind if you get help with difficult or complex techniques, just be sure to report the work your team did and the work that was done by others.
For example, you might choose to work with an animal model during your project. Working with animals requires getting a license and applying far in advance to conduct certain experiments in many countries. This is something that is difficult to achieve during the course of a summer, but much easier if you can work with a postdoc or PI who has the right licenses.
A great example of complete attribution comes from the Imperial College London 2011 team (scroll down to the bottom of their team page to see attributions).
Here are some of the fields we recommend you have on this page. If there are other areas not listed below, but applicable to your team/project, please feel free to also list them on your attributions page. Please feel free to remove any areas not applicable to your project.
General Support

University of Michigan iGEM Team
The Advisors
Marc “MC.AMMER” Ammerlaan has been an iGEM advisor for 4 years. When Marc isn’t watching Van Persie’s 2014 World Cup header over and over again he teaches Introduction to Biology Lab, Introduction to Microbiology Lab and Genetics at the University of Michigan. Marc has been essential in boosting the team's confidence when our project and experiment hit a brick wall. He is also known to comfort our team members with pizza  when we are spending late nights working on the wiki. Spirit Animal: Lion
Anuj Kumar is a team advisor and faculty member in Molecular, Cellular and Developmental Biology here at Michigan where he has become a yeast guru. Known across campus for his Genetics course, Anuj is a die hard Detroit Tigers Fan and uses his old tickets as wallpaper for his office. After years of working on cellular processes in yeast, our team members can attest he is quite the FUN-GUY.
Our team’s medaled veteran, Mike Ferguson is a walking encyclopedia of iGEM knowledge and wisdom. When searching for the protocol for a double digest, one has to look no further than Mike for the correct procedure. One look in his eyes, and you know the correct amounts of enzyme, DNA, buffer, and water. When all hope is lost, he will venture to the deepest and darkest places of the Undergraduate Science Building to help you find gels, dyes, enzymes, plates… and courage. His interests lay in the magical realm of regenerative medicine, aspiring to develop organs and therapies to extend human life, but he always finds time to help those in need of basic molecular biology techniques. Mike, we salute you. Spirit animal: Tardigrade
Joshua Abramson: As a veteran of the Michigan lab team for somewhere between 4 and 40 years Josh has moved on to become an adviser. Controversial debater at heart, he is known for engaging the religious leaders that troll the University of Michigan campus. Outside of iGEM, he enjoys tree climbing, playing pranks on his professors, and computer games. Spirit Animal: Neanderthal
Kaitlin Flynn is a 5th year PhD candidate in Microbiology and Immunology and served as an advisor for the team.  Kaitlin still misses being an undergrad, so in her free time she decided to join both the Michigan IGEM Software Team and the Lab Team, providing her with 40 new undergrads to remind her just how far she has come.  While not dealing with our pestering emails, Kaitlin spends time arguing with her thesis committee, reading papers and realizing she will never graduate. Spirit Animal: Legionella
The Students
Our fearless president, Drew “Ginger Boy” Dunham is a Senior studying Microbiology in the DiRita Lab at Michigan. His disability of being a ginger does nothing to hold him back. Instead he uses it as motivation to guide our harrowing expeditions, learn html from scratch, and collaborate with teams around the globe. As president, he is truly “the one ring to rule them all, one ring to find them, one ring to bring them all, and, in the darkness, bind them.” Spirit Animal: Teddy Bear
The Sam to Drew’s Frodo, our vice-president Raoul ""Moosehunter"" Martin is an artist in the realm of structural biology and protein purification. Working to uncover the designs of proteins in order to better understand structure/function relationship, this “Moosehunter” is a true interdisciplinary researcher spanning the realms of physics, chemistry, and biology. Spirit Animal: Moose
One of the rare veterans, Jonah ""Bloopers"" Sementkowski’s cloning expertise proved very beneficial when training new members throughout the summer.  Jonah is our team’s CFO/treasurer and keeps all his treasurer business under a rainbow. A Cell Molecular Biology major, Jonah plans on attending a Masters in Public Health program in the Fall. Spirit Animal: House cat
Cristina Castillo speaks in a sinuous and sultry tongue about her latest cloning experiment. Rather like a snake charmer, the group is hypnotized by her tales of ribosomal binding sites and constitutive promoters. A former student at Arizona State University, she was sometimes accused of being a spy until quickly proving her valor and loyalty to Team Michigan. One of the team members most likely to be transforming bacteria until 1 AM, and then returning to the lab at 8 AM, she represents the dedication of the Michigan spirit. She also known for her awesome unlimited meal plan (which she shares) and great Spanish homework assistance. Cristina is studying Cell and Molecular Biology and Biomedical Engineering in a joint bachelors/masters program. Spirit Animal: Penguin
A biomedical engineer at heart, Michael not only models biological systems, but calculates his meager amounts of sleep to balance course load, iGEM, independent research, and beard grooming. Grooming his beard to perfection is not all he does, as he can load an agarose gel without spilling a single drop of DNA. Never without a stick of Orbitz gum for the weary at heart, our modeling guru is always prepared for whatever the journey holds. Spirit Animal: Lynx
Christine Hathaway, a member of the most awesome lab group, was sure to be found in the lab at all hours of the day.  Christine is also known for her Thai heritage and spending three times as long getting to her research lab as working in the lab.  Christine is a materials science engineer who would like to explore the world of industry in her future. Spirit Animal: Walrus
Davie has played a key role in both the modeling and lab teams.  When he isn’t stressing over grad school apps, Dave is sure to be found cloning and planning how to do experiments to get modeling data.  Dave is yet another musically gifted team member who introduced the lab team to Wilco.  When Dave isn’t busy gloating about how great he is, he often fails to remember to submit his image links to the wiki, leaving Drew, Jenn, Raoul and Cristina to do his work for him. Spirit Animal: Ravi
Jenn ""JK"" Knister worked on cloning and modeling. Another member of “Group Awesome,” she was sure to be in lab when she wasn’t working two research jobs over the summer.  She is a proud ultimate frisbee bum and Senior in the joint CMB/Biomedical Engineering degree program at Michigan.  Jenn’s uncanny determination will likely lead her to start her own biotech company, possibly named JenTeK Spirit Animal: Wolf
Chris Parker played a key role on the modeling team. When he isn’t singing for the glee club, fixing random computers around campus, or making the team delicious homemade bread, he is found building cell compartment models using differential equations to models secretions rates of OsmY. Chris is an Chemical Engineering aspiring to be a doctor. Spirit Animal: Dog
Jessica ""The Slammer"" Johnson is a mystical ginger who faithfully attends the meetings. Not only is she involved in the magical world of synthetic biology but she paints houses, plays the saxaphone, has a love for insects, and is pursuing a BS in Biomedical Engineering. She hopes to either go to medical school or become a biomedical engineer. Either way, she’s kicking (slamming?) butt  and making a difference in the world. You go girl! Spirit Animal: Komodo Dragon
Jon Heiselman is a biomedical engineer and computer science minor who was always sure to skype in from his internship in Texas to help the modeling team.  He may be the only person on Earth who is allergic to chicken. His love of statistical mechanics is infectious and other team members can attest that he is an awesome IA (instructional aide).  When he graduates Jon will go to graduate school and continue his work on curing cancer. Spirit Animal: Stoat
Becca ""The Ballerina"" Loechli, a lifelong ballet dancer, also holds her own in the lab, finding time in her busy schedule for synthetic biology... as long as she has a ride of course.  Upon walking into the lab, she welcomes all with a contagious smile that will melt their heart.  Her great work ethic makes her an invaluable member of our team.  Studying biochemistry, Becca plans to attend medical school in the future while continuing her dance activities, since medical school students need more activities in their lives. Spirit Animal: Fox
Jeremy ""Peanut"" Kuo is known for his pipetting technique, love of peanuts, and habit of creeping on other iGEM members from his daytime job in the Chemistry building.  An integral part of our work with Covance, Jeremy is also a skilled saxophone player and ex-marching band member.  Despite his love of peanuts, he for some reason squirms away whenever his fellow team members throw peanuts at him.  Jeremy is a Microbiology and Music double major who hopes to one day cure cancer. Spirit Animal: Armadillo
Kelly's love of biology soon morphed into a love of coding.  Initially a member of the lab team, Kelly defected to the Michigan Software team where she was an integral part of the  team.  Kelly is also the most fashionable member of the IGEM team, but don’t let her frilly looks deceive you; she is also a member of the Michigan Rifle Team.  Kelly is also progressively developing her League of Legend skills to round out the day with a bit of everything. Spirit Animal: Otter
Sam “Cigbutt Sam” Kohley, as he is known on the streets of Detroit, is a crucial member of our lab research team. You may ask how he got his nickname, “Cigbutt Sam.” When asked how he wants to die, he replied that he would prefer skydiving out of an airplane and landing in a volcano, like a “Cigbutt.” Never afraid to be honest and say “No, I didn’t add the ethidium bromide,” Sam loves to longboard and brings livelihood to the lab. He will be pursuing a career in industry after graduation this year. Spirit Animal: Gazelle
Nick Pervolarakis is a Senior studying Microbiology with aspirations of a Ph. D. somewhere in the realm of Synthetic Biology. From discussing his Greek heritage to sharing his infinite knowledge with underclassman, Nick definitely kept it real. Nick spent a majority of his time working on our human practice and outreach projects, where he came up with many great ideas… that never went through. Good work, Nick! Spirit Animal: Mantis Shrimp
Anne Gu, a Freshman in Mechanical Engineering, is ridiculously busy and stressed out because she is an engineer. Anne spent this year learning the ropes of cloning and gaining valuable experience to help the team moving forward. Her other interests emerged when she designed a highly suggestive team T-shirt. She had probably forgotten to wear her glasses that day. Spirit Animal: Teacup Piglet
Our adopted member from our friends at Eastern Michigan University, Malcolm would travel from MILES away to participate and help the team. (Ok, only 10 miles) From making agarose gels to posing like a “diva” for our team photos, Malcolm kept everyone entertained.  Suffering through the torture of orgo I and II this Summer, Malcolm reminded everyone else just how happy we are to be done with Orgo! Spirit Animal: Goat
Always the practical jokester, Ravi never misses an opportunity to give a “if I were an enzyme, I’d be DNA helicase...” joke. Between studying neuroscience and reading Russian literature, Ravi still found time throughout the summer to do some old-fashioned cloning. While transforming cells, the topics of good vs. evil, religion, and crime and punishment never fail to arise when discussing with this eccentric scholar. Just be careful who you tell that, “will a little more alcohol catalyze this reaction, baby?” joke to Ravi. Spirit Animal: Hyena

Back of the painted rock.
Welcome to the Michigan Software Team!
Students
The Michigan iGEM Software Team was founded this year. It is comprised of several students from varying academic backgrounds at the University of Michigan including bioinformatics, aerospace engineering, biomedical engineering, statistics, and microbiology. Here's a little description of each of us.
Josh Abramson
I'm one of the team's co-founders and this year's president.  Hailing from West Bloomfield, I've made a living studying Biology, Mathematics, and Chemical Physics at the University of Michigan.  As a veteran of the Michigan lab team and after plaguing them for 4 years, I now plague them as an adviser when I'm not leading the software team.  Outside of iGEM, I enjoy tree climbing, playing pranks on my professors, and computer games.  My favorite pie is blueberry.
Basel Al-Barghouthi
MS Bioinformatics '15
Kaitlin Flynn
Hi, I'm Kaitlin and I'm a 5th year PhD candidate in Microbiology and Immunology at the University of Michigan Medical School. I'm currently actively job searching (hi recruiters!) for positions in synthetic biology, data science and analytics. In my free time I like running, traveling and drinking great beer. Pumpkin pie for life.
Jon Heiselman
Was busy all summer but still somehow found time to video chat into team meetings with finnicky technology.
Kelly Henckel
Hello, my name is Kelly. I am a sophomore studying aerospace engineering with a potential minor in computer science. I have a love for all things code, from controls engineering to webpage design. My dream is to one day work in the space industry, designing the probes or rockets that will get humans ""from A to B"".
Jessica Johnson
What up, I'm Jessica.  I'm a senior, preparing to be a supersenior in biomedical engineering.  I play saxophone.  I am also part of the iGEM lab team.  I do yoga every morning.  My life oscillates between phases of being saturated with coffee and deciding I need to quit.  I have a collection of dead insects, and a cat- a live one.  I live in a barn.  And I'm a ginger.
Chris Parker
I'm best known for my love of baking bread and singing annoyingly as possible.  When not staring listlessly into the distance, I spend my time studying chemical engineering and/or optimizing a model for the concentration of tea.  I joined iGEM this year to put my HTML skills to use and have my ideas of using PHPMyAdmin shut down.
Christine Liu
Hey there, I'm Christine. I'm currently an undecided second-year at Michigan, but I have many interests, including art, music, film, dogs, and food(so basically nothing that's a viable career path!). I've been trying to learn some coding and design, so joining the iGEM team was a great way to start developing both those skills. Outside of this, other life goals include raising a golden retriever and pomsky, publishing a novel, and traveling around France (I refuse to let 4 years of French go to waste).
Kristine Lan
Hi, I'm Kristine. I'm a junior in informatics, which is basically statistics plus computer science. I enjoy baking. My current favorite recipe is glazed lemon cake. You would usually find me in the Children's Literature section in libraries, because I really love picture books.
Advisers
A huge thank you goes out to our advisers for making everything possible!
Marc Ammerlaan
In charge of labs and graduate student instructors for the department's introductory courses.

iGEM Team attributions page
Each team must clearly attribute work done by the student team members on this page.  The team must distinguish work done by the students from work done by others, including the host labs, advisors, instructors, and individuals not on the team roster.
Why do we have this requirement?
Attribution Template
We have this requirement to help the judges know what you did yourselves and what you had help with. We don't mind if you get help with difficult or complex techniques, just be sure to report the work your team did and the work that was done by others.
For example, you might choose to work with an animal model during your project. Working with animals requires getting a license and applying far in advance to conduct certain experiments in many countries. This is something that is difficult to achieve during the course of a summer, but much easier if you can work with a postdoc or PI who has the right licenses.
A great example of complete attribution comes from the Imperial College London 2011 team (scroll down to the bottom of their team page to see attributions).
Here are some of the fields we recommend you have on this page. If there are other areas not listed below, but applicable to your team/project, please feel free to also list them on your attributions page. Please feel free to remove any areas not applicable to your project.

"" class = ""contTitle"" />
Our activities involved in iGEM were all conducted by undergraduates alone!!
All the team members had a lot of brainstorming, investigations and discussions in order to select project carefully. In addition, we conducted the experiments and FINALLY got the results.
We also designed and composed all the publishing tools, and of course, polished all scripts and presentation by ourselves. We did fund-raising and public relations.

Official Team Profile
Students
I am Ana, but at my university people call me Winnie. I am an environmental and development engineering student. I love what I study! After finishing university, I will specialize myself in water sciences and synthetic biology. I would like to become a scientist; I love to do research and discover new things. Not because of money, but to help society. I also like to work with people in social development projects, especially with kids. I enjoy sharing my time with crazy people and I don´t care about making mistakes because I learn from them every day.
I am Ediner, a 20 years old Panamanian student of environmental sciences. I am that kind of guy that is always doing something. I am passionate about dancing folkloric Panamanian music (for almost 14 years!); almost as much as bioremediation and ecological restoration. I truly believe that the conservation of our planet should walk hand by hand with synthetic biology to efficiently address the damage done by humanity. I consider myself a dreamer; I dream of something that is reachable only to those who desire a better future for human kind. I dream of a Latin America that is open to scientific development and synthetic biology; so that with them we can contribute something to our world
My name is Fernando and I am the most recent member of the team. After returning from an internship at IFC, the financial branch of the World Bank Group, I was recommended to join the team by my previous coworker.  Although I am almost 2 months from obtaining my title as Engineer in Agribusiness Administration, I have always been fascinated by Biotechnology. I am also the geek of the group; I like everything that has to do with computers, electronic gadgets and the sort. And above all, I absolutely love videogames! I love them so much, that I naturally leaned English so that I could understand what was going on in the game!  Now I have the second highest TOEFL grade of my class. In my free time (which is currently nonexistent), I like to search for interesting to learn, watch TED talks, sing along with friends and (of course) play videogames.
I grew up in La Paz city at 3600 meters above the sea level, with almost no oxygen but in a very cultural atmosphere (particular from Bolivia). I love playing and composing music. As a matter of fact, I recorded an album with my band in 2010. I really like traveling and meeting new people and learn about their cultures. My professional interests are renewable energy, wastewater treatment and the development of sustainable ways of living. On the other hand, I want to finish my musical studies after getting my bachelor’s degree and I plan to enter a Master’s Program in Environmental Engineering at the University of Illinois in 2016. My creed? “The one that strives, achieves”.
My name is Oliver and I am 20 years old. I was born in Paraguay, where I grew and studied until I finished high school. I was member of several student centers, I play the piano since I was five years old, I like reading about history and politics, going out with friends and seeing a good soccer match of the club of one of my loves: Cerro Porteño. I aspire to be a political leader and be an influential scientist; so that I can contribute positively in the sustained development of my country and give something back to the society that gave me the chance to be here today. I currently have a complete scholarship and am in my second year of study; and I plan to get my major in food science. In my team, I work in the risk assessment section, looking for coherent regulations that allow access of the people to science and technology.
I’m currently a senior majoring in Biology in the UNAH. I enjoy learning about everything related to the environment. My hobbies include going to the cinema, listening to music, going to art galleries; but one of my main interests is genetics. Being a student, I was always participating in every genetics project I could; I even worked as an instructor for the Genetics Laboratory! In 2012, I represented Honduras in the Central American Course of Genetics and Human Genomes in the University of Costa Rica (UCR). Attending the course presented new opportunities to me; I became a member of the team when my professor Carolina Alduvín introduced me to the team leader. The leader saw my interest and hard work and accepted me in the genetics team, where I’ve mostly work in the Bioterrorism section of the project.
My name is Rene, I’m a junior year student of the Food Science and technology department at Zamorano University. Since I  was a little kid I’ve always been inspired by nature and technology, during high school I focused my specialty in electronics and developed a taste for creative ways to use new knowledge. My life’s motto its “Work hard, then play hard.” Because I surely enjoy partying and having fun talking with people and making new friends as much as I enjoy learning. In the future I look  forward to become a researcher focusing on application of genetically modified organism on food agroindustry in behalf of the economy of developing countries.
My name is Sergio and I am an undergraduate student in Environmental and Development Engineering at Zamorano University. I am an enthusiastic student from Bolivia who is deeply interested in the interaction between synthetic biology and society. I enjoys playing soccer and going out with his friends. I love to travel around the world and want to visit as many places as I can. I consider iGEM a big opportunity for me because I’m interested in pursuing a postgraduate program to do research about synthetic biology. I also want to share my experiences and know people from all over the world.
Hello everybody! My name is Valeria and I am the youngest integrant of the team. I was born in Ecuador, in the middle of the Andes mountain range. I really love two things: animals and the biology synthetic.  I came to Zamorano almost two years ago, and now, I am proud to be on the first iGEM Zamorano team! I worked with Oliver developing the risk evaluation of the E. zamofordi, a copper biosensor that the team developed. I like to listen the ideas of the other people and I am very friendly; I won the “best friend of the class” last year, a special award of my school. My dream is to incorporate synthetic biology in the regeneration of eroded soil and the reduction of wastes (turning it into a usable resources).

Attributions
iGEM Team attributions page
Each team must clearly attribute work done by the student team members on this page.  The team must distinguish work done by the students from work done by others, including the host labs, advisors, instructors, and individuals not on the team roster.
Why do we have this requirement?
Attribution Template
We have this requirement to help the judges know what you did yourselves and what you had help with. We don't mind if you get help with difficult or complex techniques, just be sure to report the work your team did and the work that was done by others.
For example, you might choose to work with an animal model during your project. Working with animals requires getting a license and applying far in advance to conduct certain experiments in many countries. This is something that is difficult to achieve during the course of a summer, but much easier if you can work with a postdoc or PI who has the right licenses.
A great example of complete attribution comes from the Imperial College London 2011 team (scroll down to the bottom of their team page to see attributions).
Here are some of the fields we recommend you have on this page. If there are other areas not listed below, but applicable to your team/project, please feel free to also list them on your attributions page. Please feel free to remove any areas not applicable to your project.
General Support
Project support and advice
Fundraising help and advice
Lab support
Difficult technique support
Project advisor support
Wiki support
Presentation coaching
Policy & Practices support
Thanks and acknowledgements for all other people involved in helping make a successful iGEM team.

"" align =""right""> Name：Qianbin Zhang</br> Gender：Female</br> Major：Biological technology and application</br> Many friends love to describe me as “tiny”, because I have a baby face and am rather tiny in height. However, I always try my best not to think tiny and do tiny things, especially in my dreamland of science. But everything has to start out tiny, so I joined iGEM, where students at the same age with me think and cooperate and make things out step by step. This year, as I just joined in, I mainly participated in the Interlab study.  In college, I do not stay in labs only. I am the vice captain of our department’s girls basketball team and I am also an actress in the school’s drama club.  I would be very happy if I can make friends with many other participants here. I hope I can harvest not only knowledge and experience but also friendship and unforgettable memories.

iGEM Team attributions page
Each team must clearly attribute work done by the student team members on this page.  The team must distinguish work done by the students from work done by others, including the host labs, advisors, instructors, and individuals not on the team roster.
Why do we have this requirement?
Attribution Template
We have this requirement to help the judges know what you did yourselves and what you had help with. We don't mind if you get help with difficult or complex techniques, just be sure to report the work your team did and the work that was done by others.
For example, you might choose to work with an animal model during your project. Working with animals requires getting a license and applying far in advance to conduct certain experiments in many countries. This is something that is difficult to achieve during the course of a summer, but much easier if you can work with a postdoc or PI who has the right licenses.
A great example of complete attribution comes from the Imperial College London 2011 team (scroll down to the bottom of their team page to see attributions).
Here are some of the fields we recommend you have on this page. If there are other areas not listed below, but applicable to your team/project, please feel free to also list them on your attributions page. Please feel free to remove any areas not applicable to your project.

Hello,IGEMER!
This is our team's wiki,welcome to our zone!
Hello, everybody. I am Kevin Lee. My motto is ‘imagination is more important than knowledge’ by Albert Einstein. And I likethe work I did in Jilin_China team. I wish we can create a paradise for people using synthetic biology. Actually, the most important thing I learned through iGEM is using your imagination to create. We can learn from nature and use the biobricks that existed in nature. Genetic engineering will be the key star that shining around the world in the future and lead people to tomorrow. By the way, I love history, chemistry, biology, movies and music. If you want, contact me. We can be friend across country and culture.
Hi, my name isYingdong He. I am a junior studentstudying at Jilin University. My major in 4-year study career is chemistry, especially organic chemistry. For passion to total synthesis, I do some simple and essential synthesis of catalyst. As the same as reaction can be catalyzed by kinds of catalysts, I think my life is changed by every different changes. If I have spare time, I like relaxing outside, because the smell offresh air may be betterthan my father’s foot.
Hi, I am Shuwen Zhang, and I am a junior student from Jilin University, majoring in biology. I have always been taking biology as a way to touch the secret of nature. And, we have come so far. From last winter to this autumn, we are here to pursue our dream of biology. A world without microcystin? YES, we are leading you to it!
Hi, I am Zhang Endong, a junior at JLU, from South Eastof Chinaand majoring chemistry. Yeah, I am the guy who likes shopping. I had a terrific summer working with my friends at lab. I love my work in IGEM.In my spare time, I enjoy reading as well as staring blankly into the sky. We learn from the nature, and I believe we can make our life better with the bricks.
Hi,I am Peibo xu.They always call me Michael, from Michael Jackson, because I am a crazy fan of MJ. I also admire Jobs-- a artist who was living for changing world rather than a single merchant.  I love anything connecting with art--poem, music, film and beautiful science--biology, I believe that there is an another world in each cell---then, I have the cell, I have the world.
Hi, I’m Yujing Wang from Beijing in China. I’m a great fan of fencing, belly dance and shopping. Majoring in Biotechnology, I enjoy explore the fancy world of molecularbiology. I feel really happy to meet everybody here in Boston. Let’s start our GREAT JAMBOREE of iGEM.
Hi,I am Peng Wang. As a sophomore majoring in biology, I have been a crazy fun of biology for a long time. Of course, I won’t miss this great opportunity to get closer to biology. Surely, the IGEM is a competition. But for myself, I would rather to treat it as a long time chat when every member of this team try to exchange their own special ideas with each other. Although the daily work always try to bother me, I have learned a lot from this experience anyway.Thanks for my team and thanks for the IGEM.
Hi, I’m Zhuo Wan from Jilin University.As a student of Biology,i deeply love my major and want to explore it for my lifetime.I have broad interest,such as singing , elocnte and allegro.I’m very glad to be a member of igem,of course, the most happy thing is to meet all of you.Come on,friends!
I’m Guangyuan Song, the team leader of JiLin-China. Now I study in TangAoqing Class whose abbreviation is “Taq”, a famous DNA polymerase. And I have two goals: I want to be a biologist in the future and taste delicious food all the world.
Hi, I'm Lu Xiaotong, a junior student majoring in biology in JLU. I love my major because I'm crazy anout any novelties and I'm firmly convinced the biosome is the most fantastic stuff in the world. Moreover, I beieve that bioresearch will finally revolutionize our life now. Let' go for it!
Hi,I am Xuerui Zeng, a sophomore in Life Sciences school, Jilin University. I like reading and experimentation, love biology and psychology, social issues and environmental protection concerns. I hope to learn more about the world.
Hi,I am Qiang Fan from Jilin University in China and I major in Biology. I have been reflecting on the true drive force of organism, properly speaking, why organisms are so harmonious. That is exactly why I love biology so much. I take life as a magic of nature. And, by the way ,I am a unprofessional foodie…Cate, Cate , Cate, I love it….
Hi. my name is Jia Han. I have studied chemistry and biology in Jilin University in the first two and half years of my undergraduate period,then I study biopharmaceutics in Shenyang Pharmaceutical University. Though the joint training project, I find my professional interest in synthetic biology and systems biology especially their environmental,medical and pharmaceutical application to promote our health.so I take iGEM as a great opportunity to gain such experience.I enjoy reading and outdoor activities such as running、badminton、travel in free time ,I expect more chances to communicate with you who share common interest.

Team:Groningen/Team/Supervisors
From 2014.igem.org
Prof. Dr. Oscar Kuipers is the head of Molecular Genetics as well as the Confidential advisor for academic integrity on Zernike. He is the driving force behind iGEM Groningen. Every year he rallies a dozen new students to a conference room in the biology building gives them some advice and lets the run wild. Of course we regularly ask him for advice, but the fact that he lets us make our own decisions makes us strong as a team.
Jan-Willem Veening is an associate professor in microbiology and biotechnology & applied microbiology.
Renske van Raaphorst is an AIO in the molecular genetics group. She participated in the 2012 iGEM Groningen team which became world champion. She now provides us with advice from the perspective of a winner.
Ruud Detert Oude Weme is an AIO in the molecular genetics group. He was in the first iGEM Groningen team in 2008. He sits with us nearly every week in our weekly meetings where we show off to the supervisors (and also ask a bit of advice).
Dr. Bayu Jayawardhana is the university reader in mechatronics and control of nonlinear systems as well as   a member of the program advisory committee of Hanze Institute of Technology and chair of Industrial Engineering Management educational committee. He supervises our modelling team and gives us much needed advice from the viewpoint of a non-biologist, as ten out of twelve of our team are biologists.

Attributions
iGEM Team attributions page
Each team must clearly attribute work done by the student team members on this page.  The team must distinguish work done by the students from work done by others, including the host labs, advisors, instructors, and individuals not on the team roster.
Why do we have this requirement?
Attribution Template
We have this requirement to help the judges know what you did yourselves and what you had help with. We don't mind if you get help with difficult or complex techniques, just be sure to report the work your team did and the work that was done by others.
For example, you might choose to work with an animal model during your project. Working with animals requires getting a license and applying far in advance to conduct certain experiments in many countries. This is something that is difficult to achieve during the course of a summer, but much easier if you can work with a postdoc or PI who has the right licenses.
A great example of complete attribution comes from the Imperial College London 2011 team (scroll down to the bottom of their team page to see attributions).
Here are some of the fields we recommend you have on this page. If there are other areas not listed below, but applicable to your team/project, please feel free to also list them on your attributions page. Please feel free to remove any areas not applicable to your project.
General Support
Project support and advice
Fundraising help and advice
Lab support
Difficult technique support
Project advisor support
Wiki support
Presentation coaching
Policy & Practices support
Thanks and acknowledgements for all other people involved in helping make a successful iGEM team.

Chandhuru Jagadeesan
Contact: Chandhurujagadeesan@igemgroningen.com
Chandhuru is part of our design team and he is our main modeller. He is a master student in molecular biology and biotechnology. Chandhuru would like to see through iGEM if synthetic biology is up to the task of realizing the great works of his imagination. If these works also contribute to society, that would make his dream complete. He is so engrossed in the project that he sometimes forgets the lab keys in his pockets, and even took them home once.
Sandra Mous
Contact: Sandramous@igemgroningen.com
Sandra is one of our lab managers. She is a bachelor student in molecular biology. She is a fan of synthetic biology and she likes the idea of spending her summer in the lab. In addition to solar protection, the lab allows her to spend time with bacteria. She thinks they are cute when se sees them crawling around.

iGEM Team attributions page
Each team must clearly attribute work done by the student team members on this page.  The team must distinguish work done by the students from work done by others, including the host labs, advisors, instructors, and individuals not on the team roster.
Why do we have this requirement?
Attribution Template
We have this requirement to help the judges know what you did yourselves and what you had help with. We don't mind if you get help with difficult or complex techniques, just be sure to report the work your team did and the work that was done by others.
For example, you might choose to work with an animal model during your project. Working with animals requires getting a license and applying far in advance to conduct certain experiments in many countries. This is something that is difficult to achieve during the course of a summer, but much easier if you can work with a postdoc or PI who has the right licenses.
A great example of complete attribution comes from the Imperial College London 2011 team (scroll down to the bottom of their team page to see attributions).

TEAM
Collaboration
As one of the 254 teams that have joined the big family of iGEM, we are trying our best to meet new friends and offer help to those who are in need. That is one thing that makes this competition interesting and beautiful, it not all about competing, but also about communicating and collaborating.
Collaboration with Tsinghua-A
Assisted Tsinghua-A in preparing their parts for submission
Mutual sharing of lab resources (enzymes/flow cytometer)
Constant communication on iGEM news and requirements
Held joint seminar on iGEM for Tsinghua Undergrads
We have been in close collaboration with another team from our home university, Tsinghua-A . They are excellent team and are doing amazing work. We feel very happy that we were able to give them hands on their experiment and part submission. It was also quite exciting when we were holding a mini-symposium together for students in our school. We talked about our projects and also tried to present the beauty of synthetic biology to junior students.
Collaboration with NUDT-China
We sent 8 of our parts from our team DNA repository to NUDT-China team to help them start their experiments. Some of these parts were created by Team Tsinghua for iGEM 2013 and others were from the DNA distribution kit from 2013.
Collaboration with BNU-China
Provided consultation when BNU-China started their first team
Our team has been participating in iGEM for the past five years and much experience has been passed down from one generation to another. As such an experienced team, we are very willing to help out those new teams which probably join the iGEM for the first time this year. This is what we did for the team from Beijing Normal University ( BNU-China ). They are a team of rising stars and are willing to take initiative. We are very happy to be able to help. The two teams scheduled several meetings and we were having a wonderful time.
Communication with Other Teams
It is natural for contestants to be curious about what their competitors are doing. The forum organized by NCTU provided a perfect opportunity for every team attended to satisfy their curiosity. During the Forum, we communicated with teams from universities all over China. Posters and presentations were made to introduce every team’s design and progress; questions were raised as well as helpful advices. Every one attended really touched the thrill of iGemer’s happiness, and got home fully load.
We are very lucky to have the opportunity to join the big family of iGEM and put our ideas into reality, and it is even luckier that we are able to witness the clash of ideas and the genesis of even crazier ideas. Collaboration is what makes this competition complicated but is also what makes it inspiring and long-lasting.

She gives our instructions about experiments of synthetic biology and is in charge of the purchase of materials.
Chen Dayou
He is a professor in the School of Food Science and Engineering. As an expert in the field of genome of sugar beet, he offers theoretical instruction to us.
Hou Aiju
She is also a professor in the School of Food Science and Engineering. With her rich experience in the wet lab, she imparted us a lot of tips and experimental instruction.
Team Members
Wu Yifan
She is the leader of the team and played an important role in purposing the idea this year. Meanwhile, she did some chores to help the designers of molecular experimental work. It is very pleasant to work with her since she can always bring energy to her mates. Maybe that is what a leader should be.
Wu Xianfan
He played an important part in the team image. As the designer of the logo, T-shirt and poster in the team, he has burned a lot of midnight oil this summer. He magically turned our logo, poster, presentation, team shirt into fantastic arts.
Li Jing
She is one of core members of the group and the team. She played an important role in most of our experiment together with Liu Dong. She devoted herself to ascertain the main part of our project. We can tell from the notebook that she is an optimistic fighter who can always find a way out of the failed experiments.
Li Ye
Ye Li, from the School of Computer Science, is a member of our software group. He did most of the construction of HITGEM public platform based on a prevalent app called Wechat. Thanks for his engagement, we can chat and even have fun with the AI on our mobile.
Liang Zhiying
As a sophomore Food Science student, Liang is a hard working boy with an optimistic attitude toward life. In the team of  wetlab, he took part in the parts' construction. He seems to be a little bit shy though, chances are that he was the one  who comes out with intelligent ideas.
Yang Yuming
She is a positive buffer of the relationship in our team. She also contributed a lot in the lab, helping Jing and Dong accelerate our progress of experiment. Besides the experiments, browsing online and tweeting aroud are another works she did everyday. FYI, she is a pretty girl. Well, as least, she tries to be.
Yao Zhiyuan
Yao Zhiyuan is a freshman from Honors School. Mastering limited knowledge about biology, he quickly catched up with our design.  He helped the teams in a wide array of aspects, including the design of wiki, interpretation, and the presentation.  He is also an activator of brainstorming. Besides, his outrageous high GPA is absolutely an positive energy for the whole team...
Liu YE
Liu Ye, from the School of Food Science and Engineering. is one of the core members of the wiki group. He is charge of both foreground and background of WIKI’s service as well as the modification and upgrade. He worked day and night to guarantee the normal operation and the format of WIKI. Busy but industrious.
Fan Xi
Xi Fan, from Honors School, majoring in Energy and Power, is a member of wetlab team at HITGEM. It is her first year engaging in iGEM. But she kept learning synthetic biology and tried to search for relevent resources.  She will play an important role in next year's competition.
Ren Kuan
Ren Kuan, a sophomore at the school of life sicence and technology, is a member in our wet lab. He made a great amount of  contribution for idea discussion, as well as for the experiments in the lab. For times, he gave us some advise about how to  live a better life in our campus.
You Yong
You Yong is also in his first year at HITGEM. Young as he is, he played an important role in discussion and taught our group members about some fundamental programming languages. We can never deny his efforts in broadening our perspectives.
Zhang Xiaoting
Zhang Xiaoting, from School of Life Science and Technology, also works in our wet lab. She does not talk a lot, but devote herself whenever she is in the lab. She was delighted since she strengthened her experiment skills and learned a lot from the lab. She also made many friends.
Li Mingda
Li Mingda, as the manager of the software team, is responsible for the development and the design of the software.In the process, he learned much about the biologic and gave many good ideas for the team. At the same time, he worked very hard as the leader of software team. He and his partener completed their work fast and completely.
Liu Dong
He is Liu Dong, in the wet lab. He contributed a lot in designing primes, PCR expriments and some experiments about yeast.  Reading novels as well as meditation is his favourites, especially for the philosophical problems.  His faith is that our life span is limited, so we should enjoy it.
Liu Teren
HE is TE REN, from the School of Materials. Being born on August 1997 makes him the youngest in the team! Different age makes me unique in the team, as I'm always the guy who  love to think different or even impossible. He is the person who is resposible for  modelling work. To join the HIT-iGEM team he gained a lot, such as friendship, knowledge and happiness.

iGEM Team attributions page
Each team must clearly attribute work done by the student team members on this page.  The team must distinguish work done by the students from work done by others, including the host labs, advisors, instructors, and individuals not on the team roster.
Why do we have this requirement?
Attribution Template
We have this requirement to help the judges know what you did yourselves and what you had help with. We don't mind if you get help with difficult or complex techniques, just be sure to report the work your team did and the work that was done by others.
For example, you might choose to work with an animal model during your project. Working with animals requires getting a license and applying far in advance to conduct certain experiments in many countries. This is something that is difficult to achieve during the course of a summer, but much easier if you can work with a postdoc or PI who has the right licenses.
A great example of complete attribution comes from the Imperial College London 2011 team (scroll down to the bottom of their team page to see attributions).
Here are some of the fields we recommend you have on this page. If there are other areas not listed below, but applicable to your team/project, please feel free to also list them on your attributions page. Please feel free to remove any areas not applicable to your project.

Our Team
Undergraduates
Mukhtar Sadykov
""Feel the energy in the air""
I am a current leader of our team. My areas of interest are synthetic biology, bioinformatics and immunology. Briefly about one, I took introduciton into immunology course last year; since then I have plunged into the fascinating science of permanent war within our bodies. My favourite players in this war are the complement system and cell-mediated immunity.
In my free time I like running and doing tai chi. Also, books and friends are among my best companions.
Banu Ospanova
""True wisdom comes to each of us when we realize how little we understand about life, ourselves, and the world around us. (Socrates)""
I am a Junior majoring in Biological Sciences at Nazarbayev University, Astana. I am planning to pursue a medical education. To be honest, I have never thought of becoming a physician until my final year at high school. It was the turning point in my life as in lives of many other school graduates; it was the time to decide. After giving much thought to my plans for the future, I realized that the profession a person chooses should be worth spending the most of his/her life. For me it is life sciences and medicine. I want to become a physician, who will be able to do clinical research, understand the disease with all the underlying mechanisms, and to be able to tackle the problem in the most advantageous for a patient way.
A person may only guess what his or her strong sides are unless he/she gets involved in various activities. That is the reason I am using all the available opportunities to improve, to learn, to practice and to enjoy. iGEM is an invaluable experience for me...
Alexandr Pak
""What can be more interesting than studying life, and what can be more important than learning the art of healing.""
Alexandr is a senior student at NU majoring in Biomedical sciences. He plans to pursue MD/PhD degree and conduct cool research experiments. He likes listening music, doing sport and explore new things.
Luiza Niyazmetova
""In any field, find the strangest thing and then explore it""
Luiza is a Senior student at Nazarbayev University majoring in Biological Sciences. She is sincerely excited about being a part of iGEM, that is why she is trying to contribute as much as possible in this project. In the future, Luiza plans to become a very good physician-scientist, thus she prepares to enter a Medical School.
Zeinaf Muradova
""Never give up!""
Zeinaf is 4th year undergraduate students, majoring in Biomedical Sciences. She is planning to take MD and work on the field of Maternal and Childhood Health Care. She sees herself as a physician-scientist, working on improving this field in Kazakhstan. First time in IGEM, and she really enjoys it!
Samat Bayakhmetov
""Do what you must, and you will never lose!”""
My name is Samat. I am senior student majoring in biomedical sciences. Right now I am taking Intro to Immunology, and IGEM helps me to apply my theoretical knowledge in practice. I like playing soccer and my favorite team is Arsenal from London. Just like in soccer, in order for team to succeed, all of the players must be committed to their role and perform their best on given position.
Nikita Tsyba
Nikita is 3rd year biology student. His research interests are Neuroscience and Stroke treatment.
Azhar Zhailauova
""Everything done with heart will give result""
I am a second year student majoring Biology. My great goal is to become a physician-scientist, the person who changes the life of people making it better every day. To build happiness little by little...as a magician. I am waiting for becoming a real one.
Altynay Abdirakhmanova
""The future is never the way we imagined it""
Hello everyone! I am Altynay. I am majoring in Biological Sciences in Nazarbayev University. I am grateful for the chance to take an education, be a member of the IGEM NU Kazakhstan team and grateful for the summer period with IGEM.
I know that the future is never the way we imagined it. But, I believe that true passion to science   and intrinsic desire to help people will make our world a kind place to live. In the future, I want   to see that my country will be able to offer high quality and effective treatment for every citizen.
I want to say big thanks with whole sincerity to Luiza Niyazmetova for sharing her experience,   knowledge and passion for the science.
Dana Stambekova
""""Seeing the goal and not the obstacles we get where we want to""""
I am Sophomore student at Nazarbayev University majoring Chemistry. Why did I participate in IGEM? Because I like team works! Such projects give great opportunities to share your knowledge and get new experience. I was happy to participate in IGEM, to develop professional skills, and meet new friends. IGEM gave me ability to see the laboratory work inside.
I prefer to spend free time with my family and friends. I like to read books and listen to classical music. In the future I want to develop science in Kazakhstan, benefit my country, and make my family proud of me!
Our mentors
Dr. Tim Shipley
Tim Shipley completed his doctorate in immunology with a project focused on identifying immune responses to Pneumocystisas mediators for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)development.  In his postdoctoral work, he worked at the Starzl Transplant Institute at the University of Pittsburgh characterizing exhausted cells in pediatric transplant patients who have developed post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD).  He also worked in industry for several years on developing a vaccine for HIV using gene gun technology.  Now, as an assistant professor at Nazarbayev University, he works tirelessly to inspire undergraduate and graduate students that immunology is the most awesome biological science known to mankind.  Also, he might be Spiderman.
Arnat Balabayev
Arnat graduated from Purdue University. Currently, he is working on Microtubule dynamics in cancer cells at Nazarbayev University Research and Innovation System.

STUDENTS
Alexia Vidal (INSA)
Fourth year student in Biochemistry and Biotechnology at INSA Lyon, I provided support for the 2013 European Jamboree organization. This experience really motivated me to participate in the 2014 iGEM adventure! I loved working this summer with our bacteria but especially with all the INSA Lyon team members. Moreover, I was in charge of the project budget management. Outside of school, I enjoy scuba-diving, playing the flute in a harmony orchestra, running, playing golf, going out with friends and traveling. I look forward to meeting you all in Boston!
Romain Tching Chi Yen (INSA)
Now fourth year student in Bioinformatics and Modelling, I'm the waffle master of the team. Though not the most efficient, I'm dedicated to my work and spent an incredible summer with everyone working on this project. My contribution to the team was mainly with the mathematical model (no, I swear I'm nice, don't run away!) and human practice work, but I also helped in the wetlab for the cloning period, as well as whenever help was needed, be it for an experiment, making solutions, washing instruments, filling pipette tips boxes, etc. I could do everything. Kind of like a super hero... Yes, you may refer to me as WaffleMan!
Africa Smith de Diego (INSA)
I am a 5th year student of Biochemistry and Biotechnologies at INSA Lyon, graduating in a few months. I decided to join INSA Lyon iGEM team in order to have a look at what research is and work in a biotechnology project and it was way better than expected! This experience has shown me the wonders and the possibilities of synthetic bio and has motivated me to be a researcher in the future.
During the summer, I was specifically in charge of the cloning period, characterization tests and the final experiences on nickel chelation. Also, I participated in the iGEM France meet up and had a great time with the other iGEMers!
In my free time, I like traveling, going to concerts, dance and practice sports.
Adam Amara (Lyon 1)
Final year student in BSc of Biochemistry at Université Claude Bernard Lyon 1. I am interested in Synthetic Biology and the possibility to solve current problems in our society. The iGEM seems to be the best way to discover the world of synthetic biology,  and getting involved in a great project with real solutions and a real impact like the project Curly'on. I have been in charge of the Nickel tests, but I was also available to help my mates in the lab for other tasks, for the iGEM you must be MULTI-TASK ! I'm passionate about technologies, open science, DIY, rowing, cinema and Science Fiction (Dr Who!).
Alice Le Boedec (INSA)
Based on my interest for biology as an undergraduate student in Biochemistry and Biotechnologies at INSA Lyon, I started putting a lot into the school association “DNA Concept Club”. I was in charge of communication and my goal was to promote synthetic biology. Then I heard about the iGEM competition  and I felt naturally attracted!  Let's talk about this amazing experience... Nicknamed “miss bacteria killer”, I was all the summer especially in charge of degrading biofilms and bacterial DNA before their use in the biofilter. For the human practice part, I organized visits at the purification station and the dialysis center. Liking art in general, I was pleased to write some lyrics for our clip Plasmidoutai as well as to be the photographer of the team ! One last point : I took part in the French iGEM meetup, from which I have a lot of good memories !
Benjamin Rémy (INSA)
I am a fifth year in Biochemistry and Biotechnologies but must of all I am passionate about biology and all its applications. People talk a lot of the progress on phones or computers but it is really amazing what we can do now with just bacteria and designed DNA molecules. That's why I have done iGEM. Furthermore, iGEM kicks you out of your classic lab work to give you an opportunity to design your own experiment. Indeed, during the summer, my big job was to search, adapt, work on and sometimes create protocols for the characterization of our modified curli and also for its chelating power. That makes iGEM a really funny and creative experience. Finally, the best part, the summer lab work allowed me to dance and sing during experiments...Oh that explains why we had a rainy summer !!
Chloé Marquet--Jouve (INSA)
I am a fourth year student at INSA de Lyon, in the biochemistry and biotechnologies department. I discovered the iGEM competition last year, during the European Jamboree in Lyon and I immediately adhered to the concept, for the scientific aspect as well as the human one. I wanted to join the iGEM team in order to work in a multidisciplinary environment on an project which is combining biology and technology into a product. First of all, I have loved working with all of my fellows. I’ve learnt a lot from each of them, and enjoy all these moments spent together, during this summer : cheering each other in the bad times as partying in the good ones. During my leisure time, I play soccer on the INSA team, that’s why I’ve particularly enjoyed our cloning-and-world-cup nights :)
Yang Zhang (INSA)
Typical Chinese guy with a super power of mental calculation. Don't like to sing or any kind of physical activities. Problem is, this guy is also crazy about biology. So if you see him working in front of a messy lab bench without saying a word all day long, don't be surprised. What else you should know, let me think, let me think...Oh right, he has also written the script of the project presentation video. So I guess he's also a prestige guy. Isn't that annoying?
Juliette Paillet (INSA)
I am a 4th year student in Biochemistry and biotechnologies at INSA Lyon. I was a volunteer for the organization of the European Jamboree in Lyon in September 2013, and this made me want to participate to the iGEM competition as a student. I started my iGEM activities with the association “INSA AND Concept Club” and was in charge of the administrative side of the project. In the lab I participated in cloning and curli characterization. That was a great new experience and very educational. I loved working with all the team during the summer and had a lot of fun !
Except my passion for synthetic biology ;) I also like drawing and running.  I am very exiting about this Giant Jamboree and can’t wait to meet all the iGEMers.
Madalina Cercel (INSA)
Being a volunteer in the 2013 European Jamboree gave me the opportunity to discover the iGEM Competition and the motivation to be part of this year’s team. Although a 4th year student at INSA Lyon in Bioinformatics and Modeling, I spent all the summer in the lab. And I loved every single moment of it! My work consisted especially in developing protocols, test and improve them, but I took part, as the rest of us, in the long late cloning hours.  This project has been a great experience for me. It allowed me to get closer to the research field and showed me that this is the path I want to follow in the future.  I spend my free time doing all kind of sports: skiing, playing tennis, biking, but I also enjoy travelling, reading and watching movies.
Thomas Cruzel(EMSE)
Student at the ""École des mines de Saint-Étienne"" school, the iGEM project was an opportunity for me to discover team work. As I'm more interested in computers than in biology, during this project I worked mainly on the modelling of curli formation and nickel chelation.
Alice Blot (DSAA Design Interactif, Villefontaine)
I am studying interactive design in Master degree and the link between design and science captivates me. I am passionate by these two fields. I had to make a choice…. and I chose Design. Although, as soon as possible, I combine them.
I know the iGEM thanks to Juliette. She asked me to design their wiki. I accepted immediately ! Even though I don’t understand very well fine details, I note curli are great !
ADVISORS
Nicolas Comte (INSA)
Dinosaur of the team engineering student in Bioinformatics, I have a bachelor degree in Biology and modelisation. Synthetic Biology is an interesting subject that I've never heard of before. Naturally, with my curiosity, I help the INSA-Lyon team in modeling, infography and mostly with puns, to discover and practice in this incredible universe !
Pedro Da Silva (INSA)
Associate professor at INSA de LYON, I'm a structural biologist. I think that iGEM is an exciting way to introduce research and team work to students.
Damien Jacques (INSA)
I am a mechanical design and production teacher at INSA Lyon. I am specially interested in 3D Printers, that is the reason why I was asked to participate to the iGEM project. I agreed with pleasure  because I like working with students on such interdisciplinary projects. I think it is important that students know 3D printers technologies because 3D Printers will provide many opportunities in several domains in the next 10 or 20 years and the iGEM project is an example for this. Otherwise I like to play tennis, to ski and to walk in mountain, and also to cook french food with my family and my friends !
Benoît Drogue (Lyon 1 Alumnus)
Young Microbiologist, I'm a dreamer with a scientific heart... everything you need to succeed in iGEM competition.
Viviane Chansavang (INSA Alumna)
iGEM 2011, 2012, 2013 and... 2014? I guess we can call it dedication...or is it addiction?
I graduated from INSA de Lyon in September 2013, worked hard in the organizing committee of the Europe Regional Jamboree in October 2013, and then traveled across the planet to sunny Southern California for my first job. Although I traded in the bench for a desk, I'm still showing support to my home team. Working at the Office for Science and Technology of the Embassy of France in the US, I am striving to foster partnerships between French and American labs in the field of life sciences.
Valérie Forest (EMSE)
Graduated in Biologic and Medical Engineering, I am assistant Professor at Ecole Nationale Supérieure des Mines de Saint-Etienne. I especially work in the field of nanotechnologies, but our engineering school is also highly interested in the development of synthetic biology and strongly believes in its outstanding applications. The iGEM competition gives us the opportunity to work in close collaboration with other regional and international institutions in a very interdisciplinary field. This exceptional experience is highly interesting, motivating and rewarding for students and advisors both on scientific and human aspects.
INSTRUCTORS
Yoann Louis (INSA)
Associate professor at the Institut National des Sciences Appliquées de Lyon and coordinator of the 2014 iGEM INSA-LYON Team. Up to now my work was mainly to study trace metals / organic matter behavior in various environment and to give an expertise on their potential toxicity depending on the bio-physico-chemical conditions of the studied site. I'm also currently working on metal and biological material interaction in order to find new way to treat human waste. As a chemist, my interest in the iGEM project is to have an interdisciplinary approach of the project and not only a biological approach.
Corinne Dorel-Flamant (INSA)
My teaching activities in the Microbial Genetics mainly take place within the Biosciences department at INSA Lyon, but also at the Ecole Normale Supérieur de Lyon and at the University Claude Bernard Lyon 1.
My research work is based on the understanding of genetic mechanisms involved in the formation of biofilms and the contamination of materials. Being the Communications officer for the Biosciences department, my participation in iGEM is part of a strategy to promote and share knowledge in the field of research in genetic engineering and more generally in Biological Sciences.
Agnès Rodrigue (INSA)
As an associate professor I find that iGEM is a unique experience, a place to mix teaching and practice in a long term project relying on students’ motivation. My teaching interests are microbiology, molecular biology, protein engineering and bioinformatics.
My research topic focus on understanding the molecular mechanisms involved in bacterial adaptation to a metal-rich environment, from molecular interactions to population biology. Apart from the basic approaches, this subject offers also the opportunity to develop biological tools for the bioremediation of spoiled environment or the in situ detection of toxic compounds for instance, developments which I’m interested in. My motivation for iGEM is the same: conception and application.
Marie-Pierre Escudié (INSA)
PhD in Political Science (""Gaston Berger, les sciences humaines et les sciences de l'ingénieur, un projet de réforme de la société"", Université Lumière Lyon 2, December 2013). I'm presently a Research engineer at INSA Lyon, I study how politics, culture, and ethics of engineer shape science and technology.
Marianne Chouteau (INSA)
Marianne Chouteau has a PhD in Communication Science (""Les intentions vulgarisatrices : études d'ouvrage de vulgarisation scientifique de 1686 aux années 1950"", Université Paris 7, Ed du Septentrion, 2000). Researcher and professor in Humanities Center at INSA de Lyon, she studies the representation of science and technology in communication such as ""cop and lab"" series (CSI or Bones), movies, novels...
Valérie Desjardin (INSA)
Associate professor at the Institut National des Sciences Appliquées de Lyon My research work at the Laboratory of Civil engineering and Environmental engineering (LGCIE) is currently aimed at the study of biophysicochemical interactions of pollutants in various compounds (soils, sediments, municipal solid waste) using molecular biology tools. I am very excited to take part in the iGEM project which leads to the development of a synergy, already launched, between the Biosciences department and Environmental sciences.
Alexandre Duprey (Lyon 1)
PhD student at Université Claude Bernard Lyon 1, I'm back for a fourth year of iGEM ! This time as an instructor, I'm excited to see entirely new aspects of an iGEM project, and experimenting teaching in an unusual and rather unique way.
Apart from iGEM, I'm preparing a thesis on the regulation of the virulence of the phytopathogen Dickeya dadantii. You know, complex stuff involving 5 different proteins, 2 promoters and DNA supercoiling acting simultaneously on a single gene... Still, I hope my experience with genetic regulation, reporters and data analysis prove useful to the team.
Emiel van der Kouwe (Pharmacist and biologist)
Freshly graduated as a pharmacist but also in Systems and Synthetic Biology, I had the unique opportunity of coordinating the Evry iGEM team 2013. The experience was intense and stressful, albeit very addictive and rewarding. Back in my hometown, I met the organizers of the Lyon Jamboree 2013 and joined their 2014 team as a supervisor. My favorite experience so far is to tease Juliette Paillet and push her mental toughness to the limit. I sincerely hope this team will go through the same experience as I did.

Attributions
iGEM Team attributions page
Each team must clearly attribute work done by the student team members on this page.  The team must distinguish work done by the students from work done by others, including the host labs, advisors, instructors, and individuals not on the team roster.
Why do we have this requirement?
Attribution Template
We have this requirement to help the judges know what you did yourselves and what you had help with. We don't mind if you get help with difficult or complex techniques, just be sure to report the work your team did and the work that was done by others.
For example, you might choose to work with an animal model during your project. Working with animals requires getting a license and applying far in advance to conduct certain experiments in many countries. This is something that is difficult to achieve during the course of a summer, but much easier if you can work with a postdoc or PI who has the right licenses.
A great example of complete attribution comes from the Imperial College London 2011 team (scroll down to the bottom of their team page to see attributions).
Here are some of the fields we recommend you have on this page. If there are other areas not listed below, but applicable to your team/project, please feel free to also list them on your attributions page. Please feel free to remove any areas not applicable to your project.
General Support

About National Yang Ming University
Founded in 1974, National Yang-Ming University, formerly known as National Yang-Ming College of Medicine, has been adhering to the school motto of ""benevolent mind and art, putting knowledge into practice"" while training excellent humane doctors to provide service by solving medical problems in remote and rural areas.
In order to cultivate a new generation of professional medical talents, we began to expand our disciplines into biomedicine. In 1994, we were promoted to ""National Yang-Ming University"" and became the first medicine-oriented comprehensive university in Taiwan. As time went on, we established the School of Medical Technology and Engineering, the School of Life Sciences, the Center for General Studies, and the School of Nursing. Finally, we were permitted to establish a School of Dentistry in 2000 and also became a research university focusing on medicine and biotechnology.
Meaning of NYMU logo
White symbolizes the ""holiness"" of medical work. The plum flower blossom represents the determination required in medical work. It is also our national flower and painted in orange represents ""light"". The Caduceus made up of a staff with two snakes and two wings is a general symbol for ""medicine,"" and is painted in sky blue symbolizing ""loyalty"". The gold color here represents the light of the doctor, rendering our school badge ""shiny and magnificent"". The orange and sky blue are the best matches in chromatics.

Acknowledgements
All of the works, including experiments, wiki, modeling, human practice, are done by the students in our team. Instructors and seniors helped us on brainstorming, parts check, modeling methods advice, human practice supports, and so on. Except that the background image of wiki is helped by a friend of a team student. The sponsors and other institutions that have helped us are listed on the footer of our wiki page.
General support
Dr. Chang, Chuan-Hsiung (張傳雄), Dr. Li, Wan-Chun (黎萬君), Dr. Chang, Ching-Fen (張菁芬) and Mr. Jude Clapper are the main mentors of our team. During the preparation, lecture learning and brain storming, they helped us a lot. They guided us and always gave us different kinds of views to think about.
Dr. Chang, Ching-Fen (張菁芬) trained us to use the wet lab for iGEM experiments, and she always has immense patience to help us and teach us. Even though we were troublemakers sometimes, she was still willing to give us good advice and let us try out various experiments in the lab. During those experimental times, we are really grateful to her for all her great help and care.
Jesse Wu (吳傑熙) taught us a lot, such us biobricking, using wiki, paper searching and so on, during the lecture learning. He is a really nice guy, and has patience to help us solve different machine and computer problems. The knowledge he has taught is very useful. He is our great teacher and always willing to answer our strange questions. With his help, our project could be much more special!
Yang, Chih-Hsien (楊志賢) also taught lecture for us. He taught us modeling, and guide us to use Octave to present our experimental results. We are also very thankful to him!
Su, Tzu-Yi (蘇子懿) is a 1st-year Master Program student of Institute of Oral biology. He often gave us lots of advice about oral cavity. He also taught us how to cultivate ''Streptococcus mutans'' and provided us machine and introduced us to have a project discussion with his instructor Dr. Wu, Ching Yi (吳靜宜). Frankly, it helped a lot. We are very appreciate Su, Tzu-Yi (蘇子懿) and Dr. Wu, Ching Yi (吳靜宜) for their help.

Attributions
iGEM Team attributions page
Each team must clearly attribute work done by the student team members on this page.  The team must distinguish work done by the students from work done by others, including the host labs, advisors, instructors, and individuals not on the team roster.
Why do we have this requirement?
Attribution Template
We have this requirement to help the judges know what you did yourselves and what you had help with. We don't mind if you get help with difficult or complex techniques, just be sure to report the work your team did and the work that was done by others.
For example, you might choose to work with an animal model during your project. Working with animals requires getting a license and applying far in advance to conduct certain experiments in many countries. This is something that is difficult to achieve during the course of a summer, but much easier if you can work with a postdoc or PI who has the right licenses.
A great example of complete attribution comes from the Imperial College London 2011 team (scroll down to the bottom of their team page to see attributions).
Here are some of the fields we recommend you have on this page. If there are other areas not listed below, but applicable to your team/project, please feel free to also list them on your attributions page. Please feel free to remove any areas not applicable to your project.
General Support
Project support and advice
Fundraising help and advice
Lab support
Difficult technique support
Project advisor support
Wiki support
Presentation coaching
Policy & Practices support
Thanks and acknowledgements for all other people involved in helping make a successful iGEM team.

Attributions
iGEM Team attributions page
Each team must clearly attribute work done by the student team members on this page.  The team must distinguish work done by the students from work done by others, including the host labs, advisors, instructors, and individuals not on the team roster.
Why do we have this requirement?
Attribution Template
We have this requirement to help the judges know what you did yourselves and what you had help with. We don't mind if you get help with difficult or complex techniques, just be sure to report the work your team did and the work that was done by others.
For example, you might choose to work with an animal model during your project. Working with animals requires getting a license and applying far in advance to conduct certain experiments in many countries. This is something that is difficult to achieve during the course of a summer, but much easier if you can work with a postdoc or PI who has the right licenses.
A great example of complete attribution comes from the Imperial College London 2011 team (scroll down to the bottom of their team page to see attributions).
Here are some of the fields we recommend you have on this page. If there are other areas not listed below, but applicable to your team/project, please feel free to also list them on your attributions page. Please feel free to remove any areas not applicable to your project.

Abstract
Description - Objective - Explanation - Bases - Conclusion
Synthetic Rally
Description - Return
One of our activities for human practices consisted in creating a rally that would teach synthetic biology to students from 9th grade. We wanted to show something that was, in some cases, difficult to explain. The plan was to teach them some basic things about molecular biology that would help them understand each of the bases of the rally, including genes and biobricks, and how they could use these to design a circuit for a project. We decided that each of the bases would represent different parts of this year’s circuit, explaining how each of the parts work. For example, base one represented the Promoter; base two, the Riboswitch, and so on.
Objective - Return
The objective was mainly to help students understand that genetically modified machines work, basically, like a normal machine. We wanted to explain each of the parts that formed our circuit, how each of them worked according to its function, and how every part is necessary for the circuit to work. But all of these are hard to understand when you can’t see the relation between both types of machines. When you tell people who know nothing about genetic engineering that you are building a genetic machine, they have no idea of what to imagine; of how that could work. So we tried to show it to the students in the simplest way.
Explanation - Return
The first thing we did when arriving to the school, was to organize all of the materials needed for each one of the bases. While we were doing this, three of our team members went to one of the classrooms that the school had lent us, and explained some basic things about DNA and genes to the students. They explained it in a simple manner, just so the students could understand that these were needed to form the biobricks, and these last ones to form a circuit. But that part was explained later on.
After finishing the presentation, the 40 students from the first classroom went outside, to the first base. We divided them in two groups, and gave the first twenty of them small ribands of different colors, to divide them in teams for them to compete. The other twenty were kept waiting, while some of us asked them questions for a survey about transgenic food.
We handed out one small card with the drawing of our circuit to each one of the teams from the first group; a card that we would mark, whenever they finished one of the bases, with the points they had earned. The one who came out first place would receive 4 points; second place would receive 3, and third and fourth place would receive 2. We had one person in charge of writing down the points in each card to keep track of who was winning. After explaining all of this, the rally began.
The first thing we did at each one of the bases was to identify the name; say if it was the promoter, the terminator, the RBS… and we then gave an explanation of what it was without explaining completely how it worked. At the end of the activity, we would state the relationship between what they had played and the way the actual part of the circuit functioned. Then the one in charged would yell, and they would change bases. When the first group passed to the second base, the group that was kept waiting entered the first base.
Bases - Return
''BASE 1: PROMOTER'' - The activity was called Streets and Avenues, but the game was changed a little bit. All the teams would be aligned, forming a square, and one person from each team would be standing at each corner. That person would have to find his/her match; someone with the same color inside the square. For example, maybe someone form team Blue, inside the square, would be Yellow. The Yellow person outside would have to find that Blue person before the others found their match, with the path changing just as it does in the common “Streets and Avenues“ game.
''How does this relate to the promoter?'' The promoter needs to find the one thing that starts it, for the circuit to start too.
''BASE 2: RIBOSWITCH'' - This activity was called Dragons. Each team had to form a line and hold hands, being really careful not to let go. The person in the very front would be the head, and the last one, with a bandana hanging on their clothes, would be the tail. The objective was that the head would have to take the other team’s bandana, being careful that they didn’t lose theirs. The moment the team lost theirs, they would lose and have to stop right where they were.
''How does this relate to the Riboswitch?'' The riboswitch turns the circuit on and off, depending on several conditions. In this game, the team was “On“ while they still had their bandana; they were turned “Off“ when they lost it.
''BASE 3: PROTEIN CODING SEQUENCES'' - This base was one of the hardest to fulfill. We designed a “labyrinth“ of conditions that each team would have to pass through. They would have to dress up with objects in some boxes, and depending on what they wore, they would move through the squares. The one who found the perfect combination would win.
''How does this relate to the protein coding sequence?'' Protein coding sequences, as stated in the Registry of Standard Biological Parts, encode the amino acid sequence of one particular protein. In the game there was only one perfect combination, one combination that would make you win; and you had to find it.
“BASE 4: RBS“ - This activity was somewhat simple, yet fun anyway. We would have two people holding a piece of fabric next to two other people, also holding a piece of fabric, and they would be passing along a small ball, in several different ways, to a small box on the other side of the field. For example, the first time it would be walking and passing the ball however they could. The second time, they would have to throw it as higher as possible, and running. The third time would be running backwards, and the fourth would be jumping on one foot. Only one team got to the fifth time, and they had to do it backwards and jumping on one foot. At the end, the team with the greatest amount of balls inside their box, won.
''How does this relate to the RBS?'' The RBS is the place where the ribosomes bind and start the process of translation. The small balls represent the ribosome trying to get to the RBS, the box.
“BASE 5: REPORTER“ - The activity was quite simple, and at the same time complicated. We had to build 4 boxes with wires, batteries and a light bulb; only two wires would be connected to the batteries and could turn on the light bulb. There were 20 wires, and the first team who found the combination and turn on the light, would win.
''How does this relate to the Reporter?'' The light would turn on whenever the right wires were connected; it acted like a signal. That’s what the reporter does; when the condition is fulfilled, it sends a signal to let you know, just like the light.
“BASE 6: TERMINATOR“ - The last activity was just like a game named Doctor, except that we used balloons instead. Each team would have to get in a closed circle, but instead of holding hands directly, they would hold a large balloon. Then they would have to tangle, without letting go of the balloons, as much as possible. The “doctor“ would then have to undo their “knot“, without breaking the circle. The first ones to blow up or let go of their balloon would lose.
''How does this relate to the terminator?“ The terminator causes transcription to stop; it sort of “breaks it off“. In the game, “transcription“ stopped whenever the person blow up or let go of the balloon.
Conclusion - Return
At the end of the rally, we gave an explanation of the whole circuit; how every part was connected to make it function. We answered questions, we took a picture, and we prized the winner team with a box of cookies. Some of them asked if we had a page on Facebook, and others just thanked us for coming.
One of the girls who was helping us with the rally, was not from the team. She was from second semester, and was really interested in iGEM when she found out about it, so she asked if she could come and help. She was of great support; taking pictures and helping us organize everything. At the end it all worked out, even though the day before we were all going crazy because most of the things were missing. It was a really fun experience.

In this step we are going to cut the plasmid with the appropriate restriction enzymes for deliver the desired fragment and to paste into another bacterium.
1.- Prepare the mix
2.- Lead the mix in equal parts and the add DNA, mix it.
3.- Incubate the reactions for 1 hour
4.- Check in the gel
5.- Save it for its ligation
Ligation of genetic parts
This step is for paste the desired piece in the bacterium we are going to use.
Procedure:
1.- Take in count the concentration of each one of the DNA’s.
2.- Use the calculator for obtain the amounts for preparing the ligation mix at 20ul
3.- Prepare the mix in the next order: mQ water, Buffer, and the plasmid
4.- Lead the mix and add the appropriate ligase

Université Paris-Sud and the FSDIE for financial support.
The Université de Paris-Sud is the largest campus in France and one of the most prestigious universities in Europe as evidenced by the Academic Ranking of World Universities. It is made of five areas, located in the towns of Orsay, Sceaux, Châtenay-Malabry, Cachan, and Kremlin-Bicêtre, all of which are in the southern suburbs of Paris. The Université de Paris Sud is well known for its expertise in science but is now involved in almost all fields from Mathematics to Social Sciences. University laboratories frequently join together to perform multidisciplinary research. The university will also take part in the creation of University of Paris-Saclay, a project that will be completed in a few year whose goal is to regroup the university with prestigious Schools (Grandes Ecoles) around Orsay.
Thank you IGM (Institut de Genetique et de Microbiologie) for providing us with a laboratory, experimental equipment, and coffee.
The Institute of Genetics and Microbiology (IGM) is one of the major players in microbiology in France. IGM is a Mixed Research Unit associated with the CNRS and the Université Paris-Sud. It originated from the merger of two research Institutes in 1989: the Physiological Genetics Laboratory and the Microbiology Institute. The Institute of Genetics and Microbiology is devoted to the study of microorganisms to further both fundamental and applied research.The IGM accommodates 24 groups : 71 researchers, professors and assistant-professors, 55 engineers and technicians and about 68 PhD students and post-doctoral fellows. The Institute's scientific and academic activities have a direct impact on the population through contracts with public and industrial research centers.

iGEM Team attributions page
Each team must clearly attribute work done by the student team members on this page.  The team must distinguish work done by the students from work done by others, including the host labs, advisors, instructors, and individuals not on the team roster.
Why do we have this requirement?
Attribution Template
We have this requirement to help the judges know what you did yourselves and what you had help with. We don't mind if you get help with difficult or complex techniques, just be sure to report the work your team did and the work that was done by others.
For example, you might choose to work with an animal model during your project. Working with animals requires getting a license and applying far in advance to conduct certain experiments in many countries. This is something that is difficult to achieve during the course of a summer, but much easier if you can work with a postdoc or PI who has the right licenses.
A great example of complete attribution comes from the Imperial College London 2011 team (scroll down to the bottom of their team page to see attributions).
Here are some of the fields we recommend you have on this page. If there are other areas not listed below, but applicable to your team/project, please feel free to also list them on your attributions page. Please feel free to remove any areas not applicable to your project.

iGEM Team attributions page
Each team must clearly attribute work done by the student team members on this page.  The team must distinguish work done by the students from work done by others, including the host labs, advisors, instructors, and individuals not on the team roster.
Why do we have this requirement?
Attribution Template
We have this requirement to help the judges know what you did yourselves and what you had help with. We don't mind if you get help with difficult or complex techniques, just be sure to report the work your team did and the work that was done by others.
For example, you might choose to work with an animal model during your project. Working with animals requires getting a license and applying far in advance to conduct certain experiments in many countries. This is something that is difficult to achieve during the course of a summer, but much easier if you can work with a postdoc or PI who has the right licenses.
A great example of complete attribution comes from the Imperial College London 2011 team (scroll down to the bottom of their team page to see attributions).
Here are some of the fields we recommend you have on this page. If there are other areas not listed below, but applicable to your team/project, please feel free to also list them on your attributions page. Please feel free to remove any areas not applicable to your project.

World needs energy!
“The year 2013 saw an acceleration in the growth of global energy consumption, despite a stagnant global economy. Economic growth remained weak nearly everywhere and relative to recent history it was weaker in the emerging non-OECD economies. In line with that economic pattern, energy consumption growth was below average in the non-OECD, driven by China, and above average in the mature economies of the OECD, driven by the US. Emerging economies nonetheless continue to dominate global energy demand, accounting for 80% of growth last year and nearly 100% of growth over the past decade.
 While consumption growth accelerated globally, it has remained below average – this is again, consistent with the weak global economic picture. Regionally, energy consumption growth was below average everywhere except North America. EU consumption continued to decline, hitting the lowest level since 1995 (despite economic growth of 35% over this period). ”[By Bob Dudley  Group Chief Executive and director of BP ]

Oil will be exhausted!
*More than 100 years
♦less than 0.05%
Total world proved oil reserves reached 1687.9 billion barrels at the end of 2013, sufficient to meet 53.3 years of global production, just 53.3 years.
Obviously, Middle East has the most.
Do a simple subtraction.         The production of the oil can’t meet the demands of Asia Pacific and North America’s daily use.
This figure is more visualized.
Much more greenhouse gas!
Crude oil prices keep increasing in the decades.         With the gas we released and the result of many other human activities, the world temperature has changed a lot in these years.
Monthly (thin lines) and 12-month running mean (thick lines or filled colors in case of Nino 3.4 Index) global land-ocean temperature anomaly, global land and sea surface temperature, and El Nino index. All have a base period 1951-1980.(from GISS Surface Temperature Analysis)
Let’s solve the problem!
To meet continuing demand in the face of dwindling petroleum supplies while also curbing the release of greenhouse gases, we have two ways:         1. Emissions cap-and-trade         2. Renewable sources
Renewable sources:
Solar, wind, and biomass lead growth in renewable generation, hydropower remains flat.
In the AEO 2013 Reference case, renewable generation increases from 524 billion kilowatt-hours in 2011 to 858 billion kilowatt-hours in 2040, growing by an average of 1.7 percent per year(Figure 83). Wind, solar, and biomass account for most of the growth. The increase in wind-powered generation from 2011 to2040, at 134 billion kilowatt-hours, or 2.6 percent per year, represents the largest absolute increase in renewable generation. Generation from solar energy grows by 92 billion kilowatt-hours over the same period, representing the highest annual average growth at 9.8 percent per year. Biomass increases by 95 billion kilowatt-hours over the projection period, for an average annual-increase of 4.5 percent.(from Annual Energy Outlook 2013)
What we focus on is biomass!
Biomass is biological material derived from living, or recently living organisms. It most often refers to plants or plant-based materials which are specifically called lignocellulosic biomass. As an energy source, biomass can either be used directly via combustion to produce heat, or indirectly after converting it to various forms of biofuel. Conversion of biomass to biofuel can be achieved by different methods which are broadly classified into: thermal, chemical, and biochemical methods.(from Wikipedia)
Cellulosic or lignocellulosic biofuels：
The utilization of plant structural polymer. It has two routes.
Route1: Obtain some versatile intermediate such as 5- hydroxymethylfurfural and γ-valerolactone by a variety of chemical and biological process technologies
Route2: Following various pre-processing and pre-treatment steps, it utilizes enzyme cocktails to hydrolyze cellulose and hemicellulose polymers into sugar monomers or oligomers serving as feedstocks for any variety of microbial fermentation processes. Native metabolism or metabolic engineering of biochemical pathways enables the production of desired chemicals and fuels, for example, biomass-derived gasoline alternatives.
Medium- and long-chain hydrocarbons can potentially serve as replacements for diesel, rendering them an attractive target for microbial production from lignocellulosic feedstocks. Unlike ethanol, the low water solubility of longer carbon chain-length hydrocarbons should result in reduced recovery costs and reduced toxicity in the fermentation broth due to phase separation. These hydrocarbons are also more likely to be compatible with existing transport and storage infrastructure and vehicle engines, and possess higher cloud points than biodiesel blends, enabling year-round usage in all climates. 
Two major biochemical pathways exist for production:
The first pathway is the isoprenoid biosynthesis, where precursor molecules from central metabolism are used to generate isopentenyl diphoshate and its isomerized product, dimethylallyl diphosphate.
The second pathway is fatty acid biosynthesis, for which acetyl-CoA (or rarely propionyl-CoA) serves as the precursor and for which long-chain. A number of natural products can also be generated through this pathway including free fatty acids (FFAs), phospholipids and di- and triacylglycerols, alkanes and olefins, fatty alcohols, methyl ketones, and esters of fatty acids.
We chose E.coli as the host organism to develop a microbial conversion process of a target compound. Metabolic engineering offers the opportunity to genetically modify E.coli to optimize production of the naturally produced compound via single gene or entire pathway manipulation. Why we chose E.coli?
Why we chose E.coli?
Because we have well-developed genetic engineering and synthetic biology tools; understanding of their metabolism, physiology, and gene regulation; and rapid and well-developed protocols for transformation and recombination, addition to its diversity of carbon utilization( eg. ability to readily metabolize pentose sugars) and rapid growth rate.

Overview
The story of our E.coil
Here is the story:
Long time ago, Clark Kent grew in the farm. While this summer, our E.coil grows in the LB. What is the difference between our E.coil and normal E.coli? Well, E.coil is super-E.coli! He has the power to produce much more fatty acids than his normal peers. How can that happen? After he “swallows” a plasmid containing all the special genes, he obtains the super power. On this magical plasmid, there are thioesterase, desaturases, fluorescence system and so on.
Thioesterase and fatty acid desaturase are key enzymes for free fatty acid (FFA) synthesis and unsaturated fatty acid production, respectively. They are both extensively spread in animals, plants and microorganisms. This time, we “borrow” the thioesterases from Umbellularia californica and Arabidopsis thaliana, use them to build this magical plasmid and equip our super-E.coli. Also, E.coli contributes to offering its own desaturase to the plasmid.
Besides that, our E.coil can produce the exact fatty acids we want. And this amazing power comes from different operon structures which regulate the expressions of corresponding thioesterases and desaturases. Thanks for them, we manage to produce various fatty acids in a controlled manner.
Considering the strong power our super-E.coli processes, we do want to monitor its fatty acid producing progress. In this case, we design a fluorescence system composed of Transcriptional Regulatory Protein FadR to detect the concentration of fatty acids in the whole system.
In a word, by the ways listed above, we accomplish the switch between production of different kinds of fatty acids by applying different signals to operons, and we can obtain the real time production status of E.coli by fluorescence report.
E.coil: Our responsibility to save the world!
With great power comes great responsibility. E.coil has the responsibility to produce fatty acids and save the world!
Since the mankind found the oil, our life has changed a lot. For example, we can fly in the sky like superman and we can move really heavy things just like superman. In short, oil is the essential chemical for multiple uses.
Q: Now that the oil is rather important, why we need fatty acid? I mean, why not sugar? What is Fatty acid?
A: Fatty acid = Oil!
Fatty acids with different carbon chain length and saturation levels can be widely applied to industry, food, medicine and many other aspects. Most importantly, it is a very promising feedstock for the production of eco-friendly biodiesel. And this could be the potential power source to compensate for dwindling fossil energy.
Relied on animal grease or plant oil currently, however, the processes of FFA production are restricted by seasonal, regional and many other factors. Besides that, the cost of producing is so high that it cannot be intensively industrialized. Given that, our super-E.coli emerges at this significant moment and take its obligation to save our world from energy crisis.
So, let’s give it up for E.COIL!

Attributions
iGEM Team attributions page
Each team must clearly attribute work done by the student team members on this page.  The team must distinguish work done by the students from work done by others, including the host labs, advisors, instructors, and individuals not on the team roster.
Why do we have this requirement?
Attribution Template
We have this requirement to help the judges know what you did yourselves and what you had help with. We don't mind if you get help with difficult or complex techniques, just be sure to report the work your team did and the work that was done by others.
For example, you might choose to work with an animal model during your project. Working with animals requires getting a license and applying far in advance to conduct certain experiments in many countries. This is something that is difficult to achieve during the course of a summer, but much easier if you can work with a postdoc or PI who has the right licenses.
A great example of complete attribution comes from the Imperial College London 2011 team (scroll down to the bottom of their team page to see attributions).
Here are some of the fields we recommend you have on this page. If there are other areas not listed below, but applicable to your team/project, please feel free to also list them on your attributions page. Please feel free to remove any areas not applicable to your project.
General Support

""No man is an island"" is not just a well-worded phrase by John Donne but a fact. We could not have competed in this year's iGEM competition without the help of many individuals. Thus, we sincerely want to say ""thanky you"" to all the people who have supported us over the course of this year's iGEM competition and previous iGEM competitions.
First of all we want to thank our instructors Professor Dr Kohlbacher (Quantitative Biology Center) and Professor Dr Nordheim (Interfaculty Institute for Cell Biology) for supporting our team since 2012 by providing us with financial and technical support and advising us when we were searching a project idea.
Then we also want to express our sincerest thanks to Professor Dr Jansen (Interfaculty Institute of Biochemistry) who has most generously provided us with a modern laboratory and modern lab equipment for the third consecutive time this year. He receives our thanks for discussing technical, legal, and organizational problems and questions with us on a nearly weekly basis.
Next, we are most grateful to Dr Elisabeth Fuss , a researcher located at the Inferfaculty Institute of Biochemistry, who has supported our iGEM-Team since 2012 in many ways, has supported us with plasmids and enzymes this year, and helped us with organizing our School-Project .
Then we also want to thank Professor Dr Schwarzer for generously allowing us to use his lab hardware for synthesising peptides (like SpyTag and C-intein). Our sincere thanks also go to Professor Kalbacher who has supported our project by kindly providing us with his hardware for matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI). We thank Professor Dr Rapaport and Professor Dr Stehle for sharing their consumables with us. Professor Dr Stehle is also thanked for providing us with several lab instruments like peristaltic pumps and sharing his NanoDrop with us. We are very thankful for him helping us with protein modeling. We also want to thank Dr Pimpl (Center for Plant Molecular Biology, ZMBP) for allowing us to perform a plasmid preparation at his lab and using his consumables for this. We are also indebted to Dr Üner Kolukisaoglu (ZMBP) for supplying us with lab hardware.
Last but not least, we are very grateful to all the members of the mentioned labs for helping us perform our experiments with their equipment. In this regard, we want to especially thank Dr Christoph Schall (research group Stehle) who has has provided us with consumables and reagents and who supported us with his advice and expertise concerning protein structure.

Project idea
The idea for the conversion of blood types from A, B, or AB to O was drafted by the team members themselves, although research on this subject had been done before, the idea for the topic of our project emerged independently.
System design
The project idea - the conversion of blood types from A, B, or AB to O - and the overall system design were developed by the team members themselves without outside help. However, the feasibility of the project draft was then discussed with our instructors, Professor Dr Ralf-Peter Jansen and Dr Elisabeth Fuss.
Biosafety concerns for potential experiments with human blood were also discussed with Professor Dr Jansen since the experiments would have taken place in his laboratory. Permission for working with tested blood conserves was granted by Dr Michael Kittel from the office of biological safety at the university of Tübingen.
All part and primer design was performed by student team members. Plasmids were obtained from Dr Fuss.
Lab supplies
We have ordered most consumables and reagents ourselves without the help or advice of instructors or other scientists. Some reagents like Bacto-Yeast Extract were obtained from Professor Dr Jansen's stock. Consumables were also obtained from the stocks of Professor Dr Doron Rapaport and Professor Dr. Thilo Stehle .
Lab and lab hardware
Most experiments were carried out at the team's laboratory at the IFIB (Interfaculty Institute of Biochemistry) in Tübingen. The team's laboratory was kindly provided by Professor Ralf-Peter Jansen. For practical reasons one team member carried out plasmid preparations at Dr Peter Pimpl 's lab at University of Tübingen's ZMBP (Center for Plant Molecular Biology). MALDI was performed at the lab of Professor Dr Hubert Kalbacher in Tübingen. Professor Dr Stehle provided us with various lab hardwares like peristaltic pumps and a NanoDrop. Another NanoDrop we have used over the course of this summer was located at and provided by the lab of Professor Dr Klaus Schulze-Osthoff . Peptide synthesis in conjunction with HPLC and ESI was performed at Professor Dr Dirk Schwarzer 's laboratory. All team members were introduced to the handling of complex instruments by the instructors of the team or (when necessary) by the host lab's workers. After this introduction all lab hardware was operated as autonomously as possible by team members.
DNA-sequencing
All DNA-sequencing was provided and performed by GATC-biotech. Sequencing results were evaluated by the team members themselves.
Lab work
All lab work was conducted by the team members themselves. Neither the team's instructors nor workers of our host lab have performed one single experiment described in this wiki. External influence on lab work was restricted to advice and (at most) practical demonstrations of methods and the operation of machines.

Collaboration - Team Heidelberg
The theme which the projects from team Heidelberg and our own share, is protein-tagging. We worked with 3 different tags to immobilize enzymes, team Heidelberg developed an intein-toolbox for protein-cyclization, protein-protein-coupling and other applications. When it comes to inteins (selfsplicing proteins), it’s quite useful to verify the sequence of the resulting protein. Knowing the original AA-code, that can be accomplished by mass spectrometry.  Since we had access to a MALDI mass spectrometer, team Heidelberg sent us protein-samples in a piece of PAA gel. We extracted the Protein, digested it with trypsin and analyzed it. For the exact procedure of this MALDI analysis, please see the protocol . λ-lysozyme was tested in three varieties: once linear, and twice circular with different linkers. For the latter two, we were able to confirm that they were in fact cyclized in the predicted way, while the first was confirmed to be no linearized, just as expected.
Figure: MALDI mass spectrometry results of team Heidelberg's proteins
Additionally, in our conversations on protein expression, purification and testing, we brought up the difficulty we had overexpressing our fusion proteins and voiced our concerns that the modified pET-vector we used might be faulty.  It just so happend that team Heidelberg had designed plasmid backbones this year, specifically for protein overexpression. They kindly sent us samples of their pSBX1K3 ( BBa_K1362093 ) and pSBX4K5 ( BBa_K1362097 ) backbones, so that we might test both high and low copy plasmids.
Furthermore, we contributed an article on our project for Team Heidelberg’s tumblr , where they post easy accessible articles on Synthetic Biology and molecular biology.

iGEM Team attributions page
Each team must clearly attribute work done by the student team members on this page.  The team must distinguish work done by the students from work done by others, including the host labs, advisors, instructors, and individuals not on the team roster.
Why do we have this requirement?
Attribution Template
We have this requirement to help the judges know what you did yourselves and what you had help with. We don't mind if you get help with difficult or complex techniques, just be sure to report the work your team did and the work that was done by others.
For example, you might choose to work with an animal model during your project. Working with animals requires getting a license and applying far in advance to conduct certain experiments in many countries. This is something that is difficult to achieve during the course of a summer, but much easier if you can work with a postdoc or PI who has the right licenses.
A great example of complete attribution comes from the Imperial College London 2011 team (scroll down to the bottom of their team page to see attributions).
Here are some of the fields we recommend you have on this page. If there are other areas not listed below, but applicable to your team/project, please feel free to also list them on your attributions page. Please feel free to remove any areas not applicable to your project.
General Support

Collaboration - Team Ui Oslo
Early on we encountered some trouble with basic cloning procedures, like mistakes in primer design, suboptimal ligation protocols and poorly chosen E. coli strains. When team Oslo approached us for help with the cloning of two constructs, which they had some problems with and didn’t have the time to redo, we were happy to help. The idea was that we’d receive a PCR-product of the parts, do the cloning of the parts into the shipping vector and then send that off to the parts-registry, as well as back to them for characterization.  Unfortunately customes held up the shipping for so long that sending the parts back for characterization was out of the question. Also the primers used to amplify the part before restriction and ligation were constructed without keeping in mind, that the terminal restriction sites of both the BioBrick-prefix and BioBrick-suffix have to have at least 1 additional nucleotide at either sides for any activity of the restriction enzymes. That is true for all engineered PstI and EcoRI enzymes from NEB and Thermo Scientific. Thus the usual protocol would  not work.
We attempted cloning using the XbaI- and SpeI-sites. That had the obvious disadvantage of possibly recombining the wrong way around or the vector religating without an insert, since XbaI and SpeI share the same overhang (namely CTAG). However, if either of these unfortunate outcomes was to occur, the plasmid could not be digested with XbaI and SpeI anymore. That opened up an easy way to check for the correct insertion. This cloning was done and 16 colonies were picked. However none was tested positive using SpeI-digestion, which is to say, none was linearized after incubation with SpeI in correct buffer. As a last resort attempt, we tried TA-cloning. The DNA was amplified with a Taq-polymerase, which adds one more A at the 3’ end of the amplified DNA-fragment. Thus, using a linearized backbone with a T-overhang (pGEM), cloning should have been possible. From that plasmid subcloning into pSB1C3 could occur. Unfortunately this attempt did not produce any colonies after transformation. Sadly at this point it was too late for any other attempts and all we could do was to report our efforts and the encountered problems back to team Oslo.

Meet our Team
The NRP iGEM 2014 team is a diverse group of six enthusiastic undergraduate students based at the University of East Anglia. Specialising in subjects ranging from Microbiology to Medicinal Biochemistry, each individual has expertise of great value to the project.  We have been supported by a group of valued advisors from The UEA, The Sainsbury Lab and The John Innes Centre with the know-how to make the most out of our summer.  Not only have we learnt new laboratory skills, we have also made a great group of friends, have had an action packed summer break and most of all created a project which we are extremely proud of.
Mischa Spiegel
Course
Molecular Biology and Genetics
Why iGEM?
iGEM appealed to me as the idea of using genetics and engineering to create a novel system that would be of benefit to society excited me. The fact that the project is quite student led giving an aspect of laboratory and general scientific independence is beneficial to understanding research and science generally.
Future career ideas
I would like to be a medical doctor specialising in Oncological Genetics
Interests/Hobbies
I work part time with youth, in various roles. I also enjoy partaking in various aspects of church life including directing a gospel choir at my university. I love to dance, especially ballet and swim.
Main project roles
Human Practices Queen
Jessica Gray
Course
Biological Sciences with a year in North America
Why iGEM?
I was really keen on the idea of working as a team, making new friends with similar passions and interests whilst having a fun and productive summer. I believed iGEM would be a great opportunity to improve my lab skills and provide the chance to try new things including Golden Gate cloning and html coding for the wiki.
Future career ideas
I have a specific passion for Microbiology and pathogenesis which I believe is rooted in my summer placement at Rothamsted Research Institute. I hope to pursue my interest in Microbiology through further study and potentially as a career.
Interests/Hobbies
In my free time I write a science blog, read fiction novels and watch repeats of orange is the new black, dexter and game of thrones!
Wiki Master, Golden Gate Girl
Steven Monsey
Course
Biological Sciences
Why iGEM?
I’ve been fascinated about biology for as long as I can remember, having been influenced by my Grandfather’s passion for the subject from a young age. University opened my mind to a wide range of biological subjects and I have taken interest in the microbial, genetic, and evolutionary disciplines. Having these interests naturally drew me to the iGEM project, which I saw as an ideal opportunity to not only broaden my mind on a wide range of innovative practices, but also to experience the day to day world of biological research.
Future career ideas
If the right opportunity arises after my degree I would relish the chance to enter into biological research myself; however, the education of children in science is a subject close to my heart and I would love to pursue a career in teaching.
Interests/Hobbies
Outside of biology and university I am a passionate musician and football fan.
Main project roles
Human Practices King
Alistair Middlemiss
Course
Microbiology with integrated Msc
Why iGEM?
I applied to the iGEM team as I wanted to develop my scientific skills as well as challenge myself in areas that I had no expertise in for example, the Wiki, and Human Practices.  I have been interested in science since I was a child and as I grew, I developed an interest in microbiology; our project utilises microbiology which is what grabbed me.  The iGEM competition itself is very well regarded and of a high academic standard which will allow me to excel in my future scientific career.
Future career ideas
I am fascinated by bacterial pathogenesis and infection and immunity so I hope to spend my career in that field of microbiology.  I have spent some time in hospitals in the past and wish to eventually work in the health sector so I can give back some of the fantastic treatment I received whilst in hospital.
Interests/Hobbies
When I’m not sitting on the sofa or at my part-time job, my spare time is usually spent playing Ultimate Frisbee!
Main project roles
Infiltration Prince, Lab Clown
Jack Day
Course
Biological and Medicinal Chemistry
Why iGEM?
I got involved in iGEM as I just could not let this opportunity go to waste. The ability to work in a team on a project of our own design is an experience not many get the chance to pursue. iGEM gives participants the chance to see and explore research not otherwise taught during a standard degree and how the inner workings of a research project is undertaken.
Future career ideas
Whilst still being on the fence about continuing my education and studying for a Phd after I graduate, I would like to work in the field of understanding and developing treatments for neurodegenerative disease.
Interests/Hobbies
I have played cricket for the vast majority of my life and is my bread and butter. I also dabble in the art of juggling. Also I have a keen interest in social and behavioural psychology as a side interest to biochemistry.
Main project roles
Funding Guru, Lab Safety Emperor
Cara Deal
Course
Biomedicine
Why iGEM?
The iGEM competition appealed to me as it allowed us to design our own project and work within a team to achieve our aims.  I wanted to get some experience working in a lab and learning the techniques used in synthetic biology as well as developing skills in communicating science to a wide variety of people.
Future career ideas
After completing my degree in Biomedicine I would like to work in a Research lab, specialising in Biochemistry.
Interests/Hobbies
I enjoy playing sports such as football and hockey and have been dancing for 15 years.  I have also completed my Gold Duke of Edinburgh’s award which I really enjoyed doing.
Main project roles
Lab Queen Bee, Life Organiser, Golden Gate Girl

For example, you might choose to work with an animal model during your project. Working with animals requires getting a license and applying far in advance to conduct certain experiments in many countries. This is something that is difficult to achieve during the course of a summer, but much easier if you can work with a postdoc or PI who has the right licenses.
A great example of complete attribution comes from the Imperial College London 2011 team (scroll down to the bottom of their team page to see attributions).
Here are some of the fields we recommend you have on this page. If there are other areas not listed below, but applicable to your team/project, please feel free to also list them on your attributions page. Please feel free to remove any areas not applicable to your project.

Nicholas
Michelle
On a day in paradise, Nicholas would be found eating a delicious meal, reading a great book, and playing squash. A sophomore from Seattle, Washington has a real passion for computation, especially when applied to biology. In addition, he has become known as the funniest member of the team. One of his greatest quotes, “Cold room or die”, has become a classic Harvard BioDesign joke, succinctly describing the struggle that is the cold room. One of the parts of the project that he is most excited about is the potential for biological cryptography.
Michelle, a sophomore undergraduate, wants to live in a world full of her grandma’s home cooked noodles with a fried egg, painting, funny farm animals and trying to play Mario kart. Hailing from Long Island, New York, Michelle brings her love of art, design, family, good food, and laughs , along with the expertise in synthetic biology that she has developed through prior commitment to scientific research. Known for her wonderful sense of humor, attention to detail and neon color-blocked backpack, she has been a really valuable contributor to this year’s iGEM team.
Tiana
Jonah
If Tiana lived in an ideal world, her days would be filled with chocolate, family, fireworks and random adventures. Her love of science began at an early age and she can attribute the spark that led her to do research to her involvement in an amazing program, Minority Introduction to Engineering and Science (MITES). From Katy, Texas, she has decided to study Biomedical Engineering with a possible secondary in Computer Science. She is incredibly grateful for the amazing opportunity she had to learn and contribute to Harvard iGEM.
A Boston native who loves The Beatles, Jonah is a sophomore planning on studying philosophy as an undergraduate. His strong interests in an array of fields, including philosophy, politics, physics and biology allow him to take an interdisciplinary approach in solving problems and developing ideas, making him a great asset to the team. If you see him, ask him about the economy of China. In addition to the great brainstorming, mini-prepping and transformations he’s done in the lab, he has been writing a manual on the Chinese economy and economic policy for his involvement in Model United Nations at Harvard.
And here's a picture of our entire team!

Mediators for electron transport
A mediator must have the ability to be reducible by electricity at the electrodes and must have good properties for an uptake by the cell. These characteristics are for example the size to pass the outer membrane and the capability for an uptake by a protein based electron system that is encoded by appropriate genes. This subteam tries to realize an electron transport in E. coli with genetical engineering
Reactor Construction
The construction subteam works on the realization of a reverse microbial fuel cell (rMFC) in order to implement the electron transfer. The challenge is the design and construction of the bioreactor. There are many aspects which need to be considered, like the material and the dimension of the electrodes or process control issues.
CO2 Fixation
This subteam works on the transformation of a heterotrophic organism to an autotroph organism. The aim is to realize the whole Calvin cycle in E. coli. The main focus is to the use of a carboxysome for the CO2 fixation.
Production of Isobutanol
As a proof of concept one subteam works on the production of isobutanol. Our team wants to use the products of the carbon dioxide fixation to produce pyruvate as a precursor for isobutanol. This isobutanol subproject is based on the work of iGEM Team Formosa 2011 and 2012.
Biosafety
This subteam works on mechanisms to prevent E. coli from surviving outside of the fermenter. This subteam works on an antibiotics free selection system to improve BioBrick cloning and to reduce antibiotics usage. Besides we are working on a kill switch system for the realization of a safe future application.
Modelling
This subteam models the production of isobutanol and other reactions. We want to compare these results with our experimental data in order to implement them into our project.
Rathenau - SYNENERGENE
Our iGEM team participates at the SYNENERGENE project. In cooperation with the Athena Institut the subteam work on future scenarios for our project. This subteam has contact to different companies which could participate at the realization of our project.
Homepage and Wiki
The homepage and wiki subteam publishes new information about the team and the project on the wiki as well as on the German team homepage.
Social Media and Design
Our social media and design team is responsible for facebook and twitter where our latest information and pictures are published. Additionally they design all our project graphics for presentations and webpages.
Sponsoring
This subteam arranges the contact with different possible sponsors. The aim is to acquire enough financial supporters to pay all team costs for participation, travelling and other emerging costs. All sponsors are mentioned in the category partners .

Attributions
iGEM Team attributions page
Each team must clearly attribute work done by the student team members on this page.  The team must distinguish work done by the students from work done by others, including the host labs, advisors, instructors, and individuals not on the team roster.
Why do we have this requirement?
Attribution Template
We have this requirement to help the judges know what you did yourselves and what you had help with. We don't mind if you get help with difficult or complex techniques, just be sure to report the work your team did and the work that was done by others.
For example, you might choose to work with an animal model during your project. Working with animals requires getting a license and applying far in advance to conduct certain experiments in many countries. This is something that is difficult to achieve during the course of a summer, but much easier if you can work with a postdoc or PI who has the right licenses.
A great example of complete attribution comes from the Imperial College London 2011 team (scroll down to the bottom of their team page to see attributions).
Here are some of the fields we recommend you have on this page. If there are other areas not listed below, but applicable to your team/project, please feel free to also list them on your attributions page. Please feel free to remove any areas not applicable to your project.
General Support
Project support and advice
Fundraising help and advice
Lab support
Difficult technique support
Project advisor support
Wiki support
Presentation coaching
Policy & Practices support
Thanks and acknowledgements for all other people involved in helping make a successful iGEM team.

The Team
Our team consists of 10 master students from four different Master degree programmes. Following each member explains his or her motivation for participating in the competition.
The Members
Annika Fust - Informatics in the Natural Sciences
I am particularly motivated to participate in the iGEM competition, because for me it is very interesting to be part of a research project in the field of synthetic biology from planning and preparation about execution to presentation.
Birte Hollmann - Genome-Based Systems Biology
I participate at the iGEM-competition because the project is a unique chance for me to work on a research project related to synthetic biology within a group of students. It is exciting to collect ideas and to realize them afterwards. It is possible to gain a lot of experience and to establish contacts with other groups.
Boas Pucker - Genome-Based Systems Biology
Working with young and creative students on our own project from planning to presentation of the results is my main motivation. I would like to try out new methods of synthetic biology and to learn new skills.
David Wollborn - Molecular Biotechnology
The iGEM-competition provides an opportunity to develop oneself in the fields of project planning, teamwork and the self-organized realisation of a scientific issue. These are skills that can’t be gained in that dimension during the regular studies in the Master degree program. Especially the field of synthetic biology has an enormous capability for the development of fascinating projects.
Janina Tiemann - Molecular Biotechnology
The participation in the iGEM-competition offers me a unique chance to gain an insight into the multifaceted research field of synthetic biology. Together with other students I get the opportunity to plan and perform an own project from beginning to end. Moreover I am interested in the application of BioBricks and the intention to find a solution to today’s problems which shows the great potential of synthetic biology for the future.
Julian Droste - Molecular Biotechnology
Synthetic biology fascinates me by its almost unlimited potential. I am very interested in establishment of new biotechnological methods and metabolic pathways. The iGEM competition build a combination of natural and engineering sciences. To create our own project and work on it is one of the major advantages of the iGEM competition for my team and me.
Sandra Brosda - Bioinformatics and Genome Research
iGEM - For me it is the combination of synthetic biology and a project which is independently developed by students. What I am most interested in is the realisation of a project from a to z as well as the combination of synthetic biology and computer sciences. I want to gain many positive experiences together with my team in our iGEM year.
Sebastian Blunk - Genome-Based Systems Biology
iGEM is a great chance for me to learn new practical methods and to acquire a project   in a team on ourselves. In addition I want to use this chance to gain international experience and establish new contacts. This competition will have an enormous influence on our all future. Everyone should take his chance to participate!
Simon Riedl - Molecular Biotechnology
For me iGEM provides the ability to develop an individual and creative project and to put this into practise as a team. This includes work in our lab up to public relation activities. In the course of Master degree program this possibility is in this dimension not given. In addition, I am fascinated by the opportunity to conduct research at a high scientific level  and to be able to get in touch with other international scientists.
Tore Bleckwehl - Molecular Biotechnology
I am interested in iGEM, because of the challenge to develop new metabolic pathways and to reprogram biological systems by the intelligence combination of BioBricks. Apart I like the opportunity to develop and improve the own ideas in the team.
The Advisors
We are guided by three graduate advisers, Nils Lübke, Manuel Wittchen and Timo Wolf who were members of previous Bielefeld iGEM-Teams. They were team members in 2010 and 2011 and now helping us with their experience and knowledge.
The Instructors
We are also actively supported by professors and lecturers, namly Prof. Dr. Jörn Kalinowski (member of the executive committee from CeBiTec and Head of Research Group Microbial Genomics and Biotechnology), Prof. Dr. Karl Friehs(holds the Chair of Fermentation Engineering at the Faculty of Technology at Bielefeld University) and Dr. Christian Rückert (Postdoc at Research Group Microbial Genomics and Biotechnology

Our team initiated the project finding with a lot of discussions and brainstorming by self-organized team meetings during the first months. Throughout this process we decided to work on the topic of a reverse microbial fuel cell, the implementation of the Calvin cycle as well as the production of isobutanol in E. coli. There is almost no expertise at our university at several aspects of our project. The literature research was done on our own to identify scientists at Bielefeld University, who might become possible experts. We engaged discussions with several people at the university to get basic ideas and to gain deeper knowledge of the different project parts.
The whole work described on the wiki as well as on the parts registry was executed by ourselves. Starting with the project planning, over acquiring financial support, to the lab work, as well as the writing of our wiki and parts registry was done by the team.
Nevertheless, the whole project would not have such a progress without the help of several people. Those people are mentioned in the acknowledgement section.

Team Description
We are a very ambitious group of 10 students from five different disciplines: medicine, biomedicine, biochemistry and molecular biology, mathematics and chemical engineering. Because  we didn’t know each other before the team was formed, we expect to evolve as a group and learn to  use our differences -both professionally and personally- to achieve a synergic teamwork. We have  big expectations for the team, the competition and ourselves. We are prepared to use our holidays  (and the only sunny months in Denmark) to work hard on a meaningful project that will, hopefully,  be of use for someone. We want to do this in order to get more practical experience and have a good  time with other engaged students. Some of us have never been in the lab before, and other feel that  the scheduled lab-exercises in our studies are just too predictable. At this point, we wish to design a project that will span the subjects of synthetic biology, characterization, mathematical modelling and simulation of a biological system as well as a broader outreach to general public.

iGEM Team attributions page
Each team must clearly attribute work done by the student team members on this page.  The team must distinguish work done by the students from work done by others, including the host labs, advisors, instructors, and individuals not on the team roster.
Why do we have this requirement?
Attribution Template
We have this requirement to help the judges know what you did yourselves and what you had help with. We don't mind if you get help with difficult or complex techniques, just be sure to report the work your team did and the work that was done by others.
For example, you might choose to work with an animal model during your project. Working with animals requires getting a license and applying far in advance to conduct certain experiments in many countries. This is something that is difficult to achieve during the course of a summer, but much easier if you can work with a postdoc or PI who has the right licenses.
A great example of complete attribution comes from the Imperial College London 2011 team (scroll down to the bottom of their team page to see attributions).
Here are some of the fields we recommend you have on this page. If there are other areas not listed below, but applicable to your team/project, please feel free to also list them on your attributions page. Please feel free to remove any areas not applicable to your project.

Team Information
Some of the team!
LA Biohackers is a diverse and eclectic community of amateur scientists and science enthusiasts in Los Angeles, California. We have created a laboratory where people can learn, discuss, explore and experiment. Whether they're working on their own biology projects and experiments, or simply curious about what's new in the exciting world of biology, from autodidacts to autotrophs, all are welcome!
Our mission is to make science accessible to people of all ages and educational backgrounds. We've helped graduate students from Cal Tech explore the possibility of using directed evolution to create bacteria which generate nitrogenase, local high school students researching telomeres, and hardware hackers monitoring neurons in real time. And we're just getting started!
From left to right: Dan, David, Keoni, Wolfy, Doug

MEET THE TEAM
David Yao | Student Advisor | Neuroscience
[Why iGEM?] iGEM creates an opportunity to explore scientific frontiers and cross disciplinary boundaries with a team of passionate undergraduates. It's challenging, inspirational, and I learn something new from the students every day. What's there not to love about the program?
[Favorite Ice Cream?] Mint n' chip -- only the green kind though, if it's not the green mint kind it- it's just not the same.
Kayla White | Sophomore | Psychobiology
[Why iGEM?]Our potential for pushing the boundaries of synthetic biology is limited only by the extent of our creativity-it’s pretty amazing! It is important for our generation to overcome the negative stigma surrounding genetic engineering in our society and embrace this burgeoning field with a perspective anchored in scientific evidence. Working on a team of undergrads enthusiastic about synthetic biology excites me for the next-generation innovations this field has to offer!
[Favorite Joke?] How many tickles does it take to make an octopus laugh?
Ten tickles!
Hayden Speck | Junior | Biology & History
[Why iGEM?] I joined iGEM because I like searching for interdisciplinary solutions to problems.
[Favorite Television Series?] Monty Python's Flying Circus--a hilarious series written by some of the most over-educated comedians ever.
Michael Cheng | Sophomore | Bioengineering
[Why iGEM?] We get to choose our own synthetic biology project? We also get to execute it ourselves? Wait, and the stuff that we’re doing is awesome and is actually useful? Why isn’t everyone doing iGEM?.
[Favorite Drink?] Coffee. I dispute the claim that caffeine is not an essential nutrient.
Xingyi Shi | Sophomore | Statistics
[Why iGEM?] I enjoy being in a group of students from various backgrounds and yet share the same interest as them. iGEM has provided me with valuable opportunities and experiences for something new and unfamiliar to me.
[Favorite Doctor?] 11th Doctor Matt Smith. ""Bow ties are cool.""
Olivia Cheng | Junior | Microbiology, Immunology, and Molecular Genetics (MIMG)
[Why iGEM?] iGEM allows me to explore possibilities and potentials in science while gaining experience in research.
[Favorite Coffee?] Cafe Latte - Not too strong, yet nothing fancy.
Fasih Ahsan | Junior | MIMG & Bioinformatics
[Why iGEM?] I am truly fascinated by our ever-growing ability to harness the power of biology and shape it for our own uses and designs.  Being a part of iGEM opens the door to independently exploring and discovering new paradigms of synthetic biology.  I am thrilled to begin unearthing these hidden secrets with UCLA iGEM!
[Favorite Hot Sauce?] Sriracha mixed with Cholula and a couple drops of Tapatio!
Phillip Nguyen | Junior | Biochemistry
[Why iGEM?] iGEM is interesting to me since there is much room for creativity,diversity, and autonomy. Synthetic biology is a highly interdisciplinary field that allows individuals from a multitude of backgrounds to come together and produce novel systems, or reinvent preexisting ones. Being that it is primarily undergraduate, I have the impression that everyone has a bigger voice in project directions compared to a conventional university lab.
[Favorite Molecule?] Phosphatidyl Choline
Kane Nania | Junior | Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering
[Why iGEM?] The idea that we can engineer life to do practically anything, the idea that that we can abstract this engineering through iGEM and the standardization of genetic parts, is pretty awesome. The potential of synthetic biology is massive and I want to be a part of that.
[Favorite Hairstyle?] Bald with a mullet. Preferably if they have a beard which connects with the mullet. Preferably yet if the beard is of the chinstrap flavour.
Sam Michaels | Freshman | Bioengineering
[Why iGEM?] The environment of students exploring the workings of life is inspiring to witness and exposes me to a new world of possibilities.
[Favorite Aquatic Animal?]Octopus! Their tentacles are fascinating to watch roll around and suction to everything in sight.
Anuved Verma | Junior | Molecular, Cell, and Developmental Biology (MCDB)
[Why iGEM?] I like to make stuff, and iGEM is perfect for that. The opportunity to work on our own projects and build something new is an incredibly unique and rewarding one. Along with providing us with experience across several fields, iGEM is a great way to get to meet many fun, smart, and interesting people!
[Favorite Fast Food Chain?] Subway. Eat fresh.
Ethan Rao | Freshman | Biochemistry
[Why iGEM?] I believe genetic engineering will be one of the fastest growing fields in the next few decades. iGEM is laying the foundation for that.
[Favorite Current TV Show?] Game of Thrones. If you're not watching Game of Thrones, you seriously need to re-evaluate your television priorities. House of Cards is a close second.
Aalhad Patankar | Sophomore | Bioengineering
[Why iGEM?] I joined iGEM because the idea of genetic engineering, and creating such complexity from such a ground level still amazes me.
[Favorite Ninja Turtle?] Raphael.
Daniel Cancilla | Junior | Biochemistry
[Why iGEM?] This program is unique because it offers undergraduates like myself so many different opportunities.  We have the opportunity to learn about new ideas from a wide variety of disciplines.  We get to take these ideas and apply them in creative ways.  Most importantly though, the program offers us the opportunity to meet and hang out with other bright and enthusiastic students!
[Favorite Pastime?] Snowboarding. It's a lot of fun. You should try it!

iGEM Team attributions page
Each team must clearly attribute work done by the student team members on this page.  The team must distinguish work done by the students from work done by others, including the host labs, advisors, instructors, and individuals not on the team roster.
Why do we have this requirement?
Attribution Template
We have this requirement to help the judges know what you did yourselves and what you had help with. We don't mind if you get help with difficult or complex techniques, just be sure to report the work your team did and the work that was done by others.
For example, you might choose to work with an animal model during your project. Working with animals requires getting a license and applying far in advance to conduct certain experiments in many countries. This is something that is difficult to achieve during the course of a summer, but much easier if you can work with a postdoc or PI who has the right licenses.
A great example of complete attribution comes from the Imperial College London 2011 team (scroll down to the bottom of their team page to see attributions).
Here are some of the fields we recommend you have on this page. If there are other areas not listed below, but applicable to your team/project, please feel free to also list them on your attributions page. Please feel free to remove any areas not applicable to your project.
General Support
Project support and advice
Fundraising help and advice
Lab support
Difficult technique support
Project advisor support
Wiki support
Presentation coaching
Policy & Practices support
Thanks and acknowledgements for all other people involved in helping make a successful iGEM team.

Construction: KR1+ACP2 and KR2+ACP2 7.  Gene knock-out without PKD46 has been conducted 3 times overall. Using PCR as dictation, we found only one bacterial strain up to standard. By the way, we achieved PKD6, so we transformed PKD46 into BL21(DE3) and prepared competent E.coli with PKD46.
August 20th to August 27th
1.Building the downstream of docking domains (DD1,DD2,DD3,DD4,DD6) and the third module, starting to assemble the pSB4A5. 2.Building the construction among PT7+RBS+birA, RBS+accA2 and RSB+pccB+PT7.

Construction of the (KS-AT2)+（-KR1）+（-ACP）+(KS-AT2), (KS-AT2)+（-DH-ER-）+ (KR2)+（-ACP) failed. 4.Construction: ACP1-KS-AT2+KR1-ACP2 and ACP1-KS-AT2+KR2-ACP2 5.Construction: ACP1-KS-AT2-KR1-ACP2+TE-TT7 and ACP1-KS-AT2-KR2-ACP2+TE-TT7 6.A bacterial strain up to standard was achieved when we conducted gene knock-out with PKD46 for the first time. Meanwhile, as identification result showed, frameshift mutation had taken place for sfp gene, so we have to transform sfp gene into E.coli.
August 28th to August 31th
1.Finishing the fabrication of pSB4A5. 2.Finished the consturction of DEBS1 and DEBS1’ successfully.
September 1th to September 7th
1.Finishing the verification of correctness and the method of representation. 2.The modification of E.coli. Removed pKD46 from BL21(DE3) unsuccessfully. Because BL21 (DE3) had Zeocin resistance genes and pKD46 with Amp resistance genes, if it is eliminated successfully, BL21(DE3)shouldn’t grow in the plate with Amp. However , BL21(DE3) grew in the plate with Amp. 3.We designed the primers of sfp and amplified sfp. After that, we linked it with another plasmid of other parts in our experiments.
September 8th to September 15th
1.Finishing all kinds of expressions. 2.Because the expression of product failed, we had to verify the previous DEBS1 and DEBS1’ again and prepared to reconstruct the loading domain+module1 + module2. 3.SDS-PAGE electrophoresis: prpE, DEBS1+TE, sfp

The Hendrix College IGEM team
The Hendrix College IGEM team was founded in the spring of this year, 2014, in Conway, Arkansas. We initially learned about the IGEM competition through a genetics lab, where we used a sample kit of BioBricks to create simple biological machines. We are an interdisciplinary group, made up of several different majors, and each person's skillset and knowledge is invaluable to the team as a whole. Our goal for this year is to do a creative, challenging, and useful project which will hopefully benefit the lives of others and create further interest in IGEM and biological engineering at our college.
Seana Corbin
I am a very active person and I really enjoy playing softball, hiking, as well as all things science. I believe that the future of medicine and biology as a whole lies in our ability to understand and manipulate the genetic codes. In my spare time I fight crime as Jean Grey.
Alex McIntyre
Hey! I'm Alex, and I'm a Junior Psychology Major/Biology Minor from Fayetteville, Arkansas. I love all things medicine, and so naturally have my heart set on medical school. Other than academics, I'm active in my school's social committee and student senate. My two favorite things in the world are sleep and pugs. I was known for being the control freak in lab, but I like to think of myself as a perfectionist.​ I'm excited to not only be a part of the first team from Hendrix to compete at iGEM, but also from Arkansas! In my spare time I fight crime as Iceman.
Jordan Spennato
I’m a Health Science (Physical Therapy emphasis) major and Spanish minor at Hendrix College. In the future, I hope to complement physical therapy with art therapy as a means to help people achieve a more complete healing. I’ve begun this integration with my thesis, studying the effect of expressive art on the psychological well-being of injured athletes. Working on Hendrix’s iGEM team is attractive to me because the procedure is a sort of artistic expression in the medical field; each team has creative license in designing their own project, fashioning a “genetic mosaic” to address a problem of our world. In my spare time I fight crime as X-23.
Noah Beggs
I am a senior biology major this year and transferred to Hendrix last fall. I first became interested in IGEM through a genetics lab with Dr. Murray, where we worked with a sample kit of BioBricks. The next semester (this past spring) an official IGEM team was created, and the enthusiasm and effort that has been put forth by all members is awesome. Personally I have always been interested in doing a medically related project, so the idea that we chose is a particularly cool one to me. In my spare time I fight crime as Cyclops.
Jay Stanley
I am a third year Biochemistry and Molecular Biology major. I hope to pursue a career in synthetic biology following graduate work. I am attracted to working in the field of synthetic biology because of its inherently clever approach to solving problems. The concept of bio-machinery working together to create something of human design is beautiful. In my spare time I fight crime as Wolverine.
Chase Davis
I'm a biology pre-med student at Hendrix. I've always been fascinated by genetics. IGEM has been a way for me to get a lot closer to one of my interests. It's always been a belief of mine that bioengineering is the most important kind of engineering just due to the sheer possibility of what could be created. In my spare time I fight crime as Gambit.
Krystal Kim
Hi! I'm a Junior BCMB major from Manchester, Tennessee. I learned about IGEM from Dr. Murray's Genetics lab last fall semester. Bioengineering is fascinating to me because of the incredible amount of applications it has, from research to energy to the medical field and more. In my spare time I fight crime as Storm.
Dr. Richard Murray
Dr. Murray is the advisor for the Hendrix College IGEM team. He has a B.Sc. from the University of Western Ontario ('90) and a Ph.D. from the University of Western Ontario ('97), and teaches Cell Biology, Genetics, Developmental Biology, Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience, and a Senior Seminar. His lab was the site of the majority of our project's development, and his help in advising and educating us was invaluable. In his spare time he fights crime as Magneto.

iGEM Team attributions page
Each team must clearly attribute work done by the student team members on this page.  The team must distinguish work done by the students from work done by others, including the host labs, advisors, instructors, and individuals not on the team roster.
Why do we have this requirement?
Attribution Template
We have this requirement to help the judges know what you did yourselves and what you had help with. We don't mind if you get help with difficult or complex techniques, just be sure to report the work your team did and the work that was done by others.
For example, you might choose to work with an animal model during your project. Working with animals requires getting a license and applying far in advance to conduct certain experiments in many countries. This is something that is difficult to achieve during the course of a summer, but much easier if you can work with a postdoc or PI who has the right licenses.
A great example of complete attribution comes from the Imperial College London 2011 team (scroll down to the bottom of their team page to see attributions).
Here are some of the fields we recommend you have on this page. If there are other areas not listed below, but applicable to your team/project, please feel free to also list them on your attributions page. Please feel free to remove any areas not applicable to your project.
General Support
Project support and advice
Fundraising help and advice
Lab support
Difficult technique support

Wiki support
Presentation coaching
Policy & Practices support
Thanks and acknowledgements for all other people involved in helping make a successful iGEM team.

iGEM ITESM-CEM Team
We are the first generation of iGEMers at the Instituto Tecnológico y de Estudios Superiores de Monterrey, Estado de México Campus. We are 11 Mexican Biotechnology Engineering students, three instructors and one advisor. Our team was founded on July 24th, 2013. Since the beginning, we have been researching information regarding Synthetic Biology and how it works. Together we agreed that working on a Synthetic Biology Project that pretends to create a new metabolic pathway able to degrade a cholesterol derivative, 7-ketocholesterol, would be an innovative project not only for iGEM competition, but also for investigation lines in our University. We are happy to be part of the 10th iGEM Collegiate Anniversary competition. Don't lose track of us!

iGEM Team attributions page
Each team must clearly attribute work done by the student team members on this page.  The team must distinguish work done by the students from work done by others, including the host labs, advisors, instructors, and individuals not on the team roster.
Why do we have this requirement?
Attribution Template
We have this requirement to help the judges know what you did yourselves and what you had help with. We don't mind if you get help with difficult or complex techniques, just be sure to report the work your team did and the work that was done by others.
For example, you might choose to work with an animal model during your project. Working with animals requires getting a license and applying far in advance to conduct certain experiments in many countries. This is something that is difficult to achieve during the course of a summer, but much easier if you can work with a postdoc or PI who has the right licenses.
A great example of complete attribution comes from the Imperial College London 2011 team (scroll down to the bottom of their team page to see attributions).
Here are some of the fields we recommend you have on this page. If there are other areas not listed below, but applicable to your team/project, please feel free to also list them on your attributions page. Please feel free to remove any areas not applicable to your project.

Our Advisers
Sun Jiayi
Ashok Prasad, Ph.D.
Christie Peebles, Ph.D.
Department: Chemical/Biological Engineering
Research Interests: Sun is a graduate student at CSU working in Dr. Peebles lab. Specifically, she works with periwinkles. She advises all of the iGEM team members in day-to-day activities.
Department: Chemical/Biological Engineering
Research Interests: Dr. Prasad's research is driven by concrete biological and bio-engineering questions as well as the larger questions posed by systems biology and quantitative biology. He investigates questions such as 'What does it mean to say that life is an emergent property of complex biological networks? Are there non-trivial universal principles that ""living matter"" obeys?' The main method his lab uses to answer these questions is creation and development of predictive biological models.
Department: Chemical/Biological Engineering
Research Interests: Dr. Peebles' research is focused in the areas of metabolic engineering, secondary metabolism, regulatory networks, and systems biology in plants, bacteria and yeast for the production of bio-based chemicals and fuels.  More specifically, these areas can be divided into 2 main applications.  One application is the use of plant metabolic engineering to produce important pharmaceuticals and nutraceuticals.  The second is the engineering of photoautotrophs for the production of bio-based chemicals and fuels.

TCU-Taiwan is a team founded in 2009 and was instructed by Professor Ingrid Y.C. Liu, Professor Peng Yeong Woon and Professor Hsin-Yi Yu. Now it is taken over by Professor Ingrid Y.-C. Liu, Professor Peng Yeong Woon and Professor Yung-Hao Ching. Our team have students from department of medical informatics and department of molecular biology and human genetics of Tzu Chi University.
 
 
 
 
 
 
Who are we?  
We are TCU-Taiwn team !
We are a small team with only 7 people, so each of us has to carry multi-work. It is not easy to have so much work while our class is heavy, too. And we did had a hard time that everyone wanted to give up. But we took it over successfully by helping each other as well as accomplishing our own job. As time goes by, TCU_Taiwan has grown from a team to a big family. Together, we all looking forward to enjoy the iGEM competition and share more details about our “Trogene Horse” with all iGEMers.

Lin,Yi-Ting     Eating
 
Hello! I am Yi-Ting, a junior student majoring in Molecular Biology and Human Genetics at Tzu Chi University. I am really delighting to get an opportunity joining in iGEM. I am the leader of 2014 TCU-Taiwan. In our team, I worked with wet experiment and 2014 Synthetic Biology information meeting of local senior high school and Tzu Chi University as a chief convener. My hobbies are playing basketball, riding bike, running, listening to classical music, journey and eating. My dream is to be a traveler, eat and play all around the world! I am full of enthusiasm in molecular biology and hope to gain more knowledge of molecular biology during the competition. Let’s do our best and enjoy the iGEM! I think it as the most special experience to me.
Shan, Zhe     Ted
 
I am Zhe Shan , you can also call me Ted. I am majoring in molecular biology and human genetics now. I come from China and I play as second leader in TCU_Taiwan. I am in charge of our project’s system design, and I also join some part of our wet experiment.I enjoy working with my teammates together. In addition to learning synthetic biology, iGEM has let me understand the idea of teamship and responsibility.
I love science, I enjoy working in the lab because it makes me feel very cool. And I consider Taiwan, this beautiful island, as my second hometown, its special culture impressed me a lot. When I am free, I like swimming, playing computer games, listening rock and roll (ROCK!!!) and eating. My dream is make some great contribution on molecular biology and get famous for that.
Hsieh,Siang-En     Sharon
 
Sharon is a sentimental student who always got so many interesting ideas in his brain. With these ideas, he often see things from a different point of view and this can sometimes get an unexpected result .He enjoys thinking, sharing his ideas with other people, reading books and arts. Thanks to his unlimited imagination, we never get lack of ideas during our project design. Besides, he is a professional photographer in our team.
Chen,Shih-Jie     Mr.Bo
 
Hey guys! I am happy to join this party with you. I am BoBo Chen from TzuChi University, Hualien. I am a junior student and I am working in microbiology genetic lab now. And I am in charge of wet experiment of TCU_Taiwan. I like playing basketball since I was a child, and when I grew up genetics and physiology of bacteria became my second interest. I hope I can make the best of what I learned and improve it during this competition.
Chen,Yu-Ting     Regina
 
Hello everyone! I am Yu-Ting Chen. I come from Taiwan and I am a junior student of TzuChi University, Hualien. I am working on wet experiment in TCU_Taiwan and I see my work as pleasure! In other time, I like surfing the Facebook, hang out with my friends and reading scientific articles. I want to make more friends, so please contact with me if we have same hobbies!
Lien,Pei-Yi     Denise
 
Hello~ My name is Denise. I come from Taiwan. And I study in Tzu Chi University , my major is Molecular Biology and Human Genetics. I am in experimental group in TCU_Taiwan and I also do some administrative matters.
I want to join the iGEM contest, because I want to make many new friends from different countries, and build up my global vision. I’m so exciting to participate iGEM in MIT. Besides, I like making friends, welcome to add my facebook : bty31025@yahoo.com.tw
The iGEM 2014 Giant Jamboree! I am coming!!
Hao,Hsu     House
 
Nice to meet you, every iGEMers! My name is House, the oldest member in TCU_Taiwan.
My major is Medical Informatics. Do you know what is Medical Informatics? If not, you can consider my major as “computer science” plus “medicine”.However, iGEM is Synthetic Biology competition, then… Why am I here? What can I do? Actually, what I am doing is coding our wiki page to become the best one!And the most important is to study all about Synthetic Biology from wetlab to drylab. We still got a lot of things to learn, but just enjoying this short fantasy now.
See you in MIT. =)

UESTC-China mainly consisted of the juniors from school of life science and technology. The group were divided into 3 sub-groups, the first focused on design of the project, the second were responsible for the artwork and activity organization, and the third paid their attention to wiki construction. Besides, we would like to thank our altruistic instructors and advisors, who helped us a lot in the whole process.
Team Members
Ke Han, who may also called Roxanne, is in charge of artwork. Though majors in bioinformatics, she gains lots of experimental skills by iGEM. Now she has been getting a more clear view of synthetic biology by working in the lab. And watching her making all kinds of mistakes is hilarious, which eases us from pressure.
Jiao He, a racy and sanguine girl, is mainly responsible for the human practice. Besides that she also do some writing and paper work for constructing wiki. Though lacking particular skill like anyone else possess in our team, she contributes a lot to our team for tackling some trivial or petty but important things for our team.
Yasong Cui is the leader of our team. With his excellent grade and domination in synthetic biology, he is called ""Lord of School"". We turn to him every time when problems come up. So having too much things to do is always a problem for him. He loves to have some midnight snacks after long time experimenting.
Li jie is a hardworking junior student with a good sence of humor. He can pull it off for several days and nights to complete his experiment. And he is really funny in our daily life. During summer time trainning, his jokes kept our team in a good mood.
Jingyao Li is a junior studying biotechnology and plant genome engineering in the university of electrical science and technology of China. She works on vector construction and plant transformation. At the same time, as the lab manager of UESTC-CHINA team, she takes charge of the wet lab. Outside of the lab, she loves traveling and climbing.
Rui Liu is a huge fan of basketball. With his passionate attitude and appealing personality, he is in charge of human practice. And he works in lab, too. His favorate sports star is Kobe Bryant. And it's his dream to take his girlfriend to the Staples Center, watching a live game together.
Wei-Xin Liu, the head of modeling. With competitive mathematics background, he is indispensable for our team. Not only math, he also interested in the way life operates, including its metabolism, reproduction and regulation. He has a deep comprehension of the life machine and is the control of the modeling team.
Zihui Yan studies in the Plant Genome Engineering Laboratory, so he is very good at experimenting. And he is very involved with plants. At his spare time, he likes to play tennis, talk to others, and play the game""League of Legends"".
Zhiqiang Yan is the wiki builder of our team. He has a competitive power of programming, which is a complimentary of our team. In his spare time, he enjoys riding and playing basketball. Especially, he is fascinated by 3D movies, which is very fantastic.
Instructors
Yong Zhang  Professor Zhang tutored us about how to construct a vector, in his class ""Genetic Engineering"" last semester. He quoted a shocking number of examples to walk us through the class, so we got to understand these technologies better.
Xuelian Zheng  Professor Zheng is quite rigorous about her experiment, which is really a model for us. And she was in charge of the lesson ""Molecular Biology"". She taught with her loving personality. And she is also a amiable mother, who loves to share jokes about her son.
Lixia Tang  She is wise lady with a graceful vioce and she cares about us a lot. With her advices about experimental skills, like how to use the pipette properly without larger deviation. It sure to make us easier to put the knowledge into practice in our project.
Advisers
Xu Tang  Tang just finish his first year as a postgraduate student. Whenever we see him, he's fully occupied with experiment. And personally our team leader admire him for his rigorous scholarship. Yet during lunch break, he brings us a lot of fun.
Zhengyang Xie  We call her ""senior xie"" for nickname because she is so confident with her knowledge of biology. And she is a very warmhearted kind person who is also pretty cool. Last summer she rode her way around the largest lake of western China, and took this picture.

Attributions
iGEM Team attributions page
Each team must clearly attribute work done by the student team members on this page.  The team must distinguish work done by the students from work done by others, including the host labs, advisors, instructors, and individuals not on the team roster.
Why do we have this requirement?
Attribution Template
We have this requirement to help the judges know what you did yourselves and what you had help with. We don't mind if you get help with difficult or complex techniques, just be sure to report the work your team did and the work that was done by others.
For example, you might choose to work with an animal model during your project. Working with animals requires getting a license and applying far in advance to conduct certain experiments in many countries. This is something that is difficult to achieve during the course of a summer, but much easier if you can work with a postdoc or PI who has the right licenses.
A great example of complete attribution comes from the Imperial College London 2011 team (scroll down to the bottom of their team page to see attributions).
Here are some of the fields we recommend you have on this page. If there are other areas not listed below, but applicable to your team/project, please feel free to also list them on your attributions page. Please feel free to remove any areas not applicable to your project.
General Support
Project support and advice
Fundraising help and advice
Lab support
Difficult technique support
Project advisor support
Wiki support
Presentation coaching

iGEM Team attributions page
Each team must clearly attribute work done by the student team members on this page.  The team must distinguish work done by the students from work done by others, including the host labs, advisors, instructors, and individuals not on the team roster.
Why do we have this requirement?
Attribution Template
We have this requirement to help the judges know what you did yourselves and what you had help with. We don't mind if you get help with difficult or complex techniques, just be sure to report the work your team did and the work that was done by others.
For example, you might choose to work with an animal model during your project. Working with animals requires getting a license and applying far in advance to conduct certain experiments in many countries. This is something that is difficult to achieve during the course of a summer, but much easier if you can work with a postdoc or PI who has the right licenses.
A great example of complete attribution comes from the Imperial College London 2011 team (scroll down to the bottom of their team page to see attributions).
Here are some of the fields we recommend you have on this page. If there are other areas not listed below, but applicable to your team/project, please feel free to also list them on your attributions page. Please feel free to remove any areas not applicable to your project.

iGEM was a great way for me to end my Bachelor's degree in Biotechnology and Food Engineering. I've learned a lot (mostly from my own stupid mistakes) and had fun. When I'm not in the lab transforming bacteria, I enjoy mountain biking and playing board games. I really don't have a clue what I'm going to do once iGEM is over. I'll probably spend lots of time with my husband who I've barely seen since iGEM took over my summer.

Haveing finished my bachelor's degree in Biotechnology and Food Engineering (B.Sc.) I've started my studies at the Technion's graduate school. The essence of the iGEM competition for me is the development and establishment of a startup company. Besides lab work and science knowledge, it gave me the tools of marketing and the chance to believe in an idea and push it forward to success.

I'm about to finish my undergraduate studies in the department of Biotechnology and Food Engineering (B.Sc.). To me, iGEM was a sobering experience: it meant peeking out of the undergraduate crib, and catching a glimpse of the real world. Apart from the scientific facet (brainstorming, working in the lab) I've learned a lot about my own abilities. Instead of trying to match up to other peoples' skills, I learned how to identify and harness my own unique strengths (such as my crazy imagination!), while conquering my weaknesses. Another important thing that I learned, is how to work as part of a team (each team member has his own unique perceptions and ideas)- while enjoying the company of some great minds! I am truly grateful for this experience!

I have just finished my undergraduate studies in the department of Biotechnology and Food Engineering (B.Sc.).  Currently, I am starting my graduate studies in the field of microbiology and quantitative Biology (M.Sc.) at the Technion's department of Biology. iGEM gave me the opportunity to undergo a full study process, from defining  a problem, to designing a solution  as well as modeling and working in the lab. During my participation in iGEM I have discovered the great potential of combining quantitative studies with traditional and innovative biological methods.

Hello, I'm a fourth year student at the Technion Institute of Technology, I am studying Biochemical Engineering and Chemistry Science. I am fascinated by engineering-science interplay. I decided to join the iGEM competition because I felt that this would be the only chance I would get in my B.Sc. career to prove that the combination between nano-chemistry and synthetic biology can lead to solving critical problems that would not be able to be solved by these fields separately. Apart from my educational interests, I would like to play an important role in a comeback of Breaking Bad  and to make some ""safe"" chemistry stuff.

You know nothing [about me], Jon Snow, so keep reading... I have just now finished my bachelor's degrees in Mathematics, Physics and Computer Science. Through the iGEM competition, I have gained important experience in independent research, as well as in teamwork and collaboration. I have also had the chance to learn a completely new field (Biotechnology) on my own, and to implement some of my ideas in this field. Also, I really like Game of Thrones, so: Mathematics is coming. A Physicist always pays his debts. Family, Duty, Computer Science.

I might only be finishing my second year of my Bachelor's degree in Physics (B.Sc.) now, but thanks to the iGEM competition I had the chance to get my hands dirty in various advanced topics such as bio-physical statistics, computational physics and developing and testing my own physical models. My passion for learning and experiencing new fields of knowledge is what led me to participate in iGEM and thanks to this amazing opportunity I completely fell in love with synthetic biology!

The Synthetic Biology Laboratory for the Decipherment of Genomic Codes
Roee Amit, Department of Biotechnology and Food Engineering, Technion
Dr Amit's group is focused on constructing ""Synthetic Enhancer Circuits"" for a variety of applications and research objectives.
The group's primary purpose is to decipher basic enhancer design principles using a variety of microscopy, molecular engineering, and theoretical approaches,
including new synthetic biology tools developed in the lab.
Dr. Roee Amit
Assistant Professor
Dr Amit received his undergraduate degree in Applied and Engineering Physics from Cornell University in 1994. After a short a stint in the IDF, he carried out his graduate studies on the interactions of proteins and DNA at the single molecule level in the Weizmann Institute of Science under the supervision of Prof. Joel Stavans, completing his Ph.D in 2004. In 2006, he moved to Caltech, where he specialized in Synthetic Biology working as a post-doctoral scholar in collaboration with Prof. Scott Fraser, Frances Arnold, and Rob Phillips. In 2011, Dr Amit returned to Israel with a Senior Lecturer (Assistant Professor) appointment to start the Technion's first Synthetic Biology research lab.
Dr. Orna Atar
Lab manager
I'm the lab manager in Roee Amit's lab. I have a PhD in human molecular genetics and biochemistry from the Sackler Faculty of Medicine in Tel Aviv University. I love the concept of iGEM, doing your own research so early in your science career! Synthetic biology is the coolest thing in biology – being able to play with all the knowledge gained until now and create new tools for better understanding biology and creating new applications is FUN!
Inbal Vaknin
I'm a M.Sc student in the lab. My main interest is gene regulation in yeast. As part of my M.Sc, I'm working on expressing bacterial genes in yeast for the purpose of innovative gene regulation inside the yeast's nucleus. I recieved my B.Sc degree from the Biotechnology and Food engineering Faculty in the Technion. Disclosure about myself: In 2013, I participated in the iGEM contest and I was a part of the very first team from the Technion (and so in Israel), which was my first experience in the fascinating synthetic biology world.
Lior Levy
I'm a Master student in the lab, I received my B.Sc from the faculty of Biotechnology and Food Engineering at the Technion. I was part of the first iGEM group from the Technion (and Israel) and now I'm one of the new iGEM team mentor. I'm interested in Two Component Systems and especially how to use them in order to make novelty synthetic biology circuits. On my spare time I like to dub cartoons and narrate everything I read.
Michal Brunwasser
I’m a PhD student in the lab and I’m interested in many aspects of synthetic biology. Currently I’m working on synthetic bacterial enhancers in order to gain insight on the regulatory code encoded within natural enhancers. I received my B.Sc. in Life Sciences from the Hebrew University in Jerusalem in 2006 and my M.Sc. degree in Biology from the Technion in 2010.
Noa Katz
I received my first degree summa cum laude from the Faculty of Biotechnology and Food Engineering in the Technion, and went straight to a PhD degree, as a part of the special doctorate program. I'm interested in many aspects of synthetic biology, mainly because of its engineering-like approach to biology; such as the reprogramming of cells that can cause them to re-grow a tissue, or to act as an analytic micro-robot. In order to know how to program living cells, the way we do electrical components, we need to understand how certain processes in biology actually work. Currently, I’m working on the transcription characterization and the creation of RNA-protein structures in vivo. On a more personal note, I like to read, play chess, and eat vanilla flavored pancakes.

This is something that is difficult to achieve during the course of a summer, but much easier if you can work with a postdoc or PI who has the right licenses.
A great example of complete attribution comes from the Imperial College London 2011 team (scroll down to the bottom of their team page to see attributions).
Here are some of the fields we recommend you have on this page. If there are other areas not listed below, but applicable to your team/project, please feel free to also list them on your attributions page. Please feel free to remove any areas not applicable to your project.

Gregory Poterewicz
Year: Junior
Major: Biology
When I finally get to leave the lab, I go to sleep for the few hours that I have. When I actually have time, I love to go out into the world and explore, always looking to have new experiences. I am hoping to go to grad school after Stony Brook where my research will conveniently take me to exotic places.
Favorite Lab Moment:
When we found out about our anonymous donor because it meant that the work we were putting in meant something to someone.
Helen Liu
Year: Sophomore
Major: Chemical Engineering
I've often been told I have a surprising sense of humor. Sometimes I even surprise myself. In my free time, I like to watch TV, or sleep, or fall asleep while watching TV. After helping to build the wiki, I'm looking forward to not looking at HTML/CSS for very long time.
Favorite Lab Moment:
When Nic, Gurkamal and I masterminded a kidnapping of Gouda's origami cranes when he went on vacation. (But we all know the real mastermind was me.)
Janki Patel
Year: Sophomore
Major: Biochemistry
One day I plan to one day attend medical school and eventually achieve a career as a doctor.  After shadowing around the medical field for a year, the study of the brain has particularly fascinated me, so neurology is a field that I'm looking to pursue.  While  attending Stony Brook, I will further my knowledge in these areas and contribute to my community through both volunteering and research.
Favorite Lab Moment:
The first time I ever touched anything in the lab. A gel crumbled in my hands and I was afraid to do any lab work for a solid month
Maryam Ige
Year: Junior
Major: Biomedical Engineering
I’ve often been told that I am a challenge driven person. I can’t help that I relish the feeling of accomplishment. So I’m often in situations where I am testing my limits. But what THE ultimate challenge to me is, is dabbling in the impossible; having my imagination brought to life. Hence, iGEM was like a blessing for me: it empowered with the opportunity to create biological systems not found in nature. So cool!!!!
Favorite Lab Moment:
When I became a pro in origami. Thanks Helen!
Gurkamal Kaur
Year: Junior
Major: Biology
Hello my name is Gurkamal Kaur! Here at Stony Brook, I am pursuing a career in medicine and hope to become a future educator in the medical field. Every summer, I participate in a summer day camp and teach elementary school children reading and math skills. It is quite satisfying to know you are making a difference in a child's life and inspiring them to learn while having fun!  In my free time, I like to engage in long distance running and playing the lovely sport of volleyball! Above all, there is nothing quite like going hiking with my amazing dog, Oreo!
Favorite Lab Moment:
Streaming the FIFA world cup in lab. Talk about multi-tasking!
Karen Wong
Year: Junior
Major: Biology
Minor: Biomedical Engineering
I'm on the Pre-Med track, but after joining the iGEM team, I realized that I should keep an open mind to graduate school or a career in different areas of science and medicine. I am very outspoken about my thoughts on feminism and the equality between men and women, but I am constantly learning new perspectives and ideas that add to my knowledge of the issue. I want boys and girls to grow up with as few differences as possible.
Favorite Lab Moment:
Debating with Greg as to why I don’t like the term “chick flick.”
Mohamed Gouda
Year: Junior
Major: Biochemistry
I hold a number of interests outside of studying and pursuing a career in medicine. High on that list would have to be chess. I enjoy playing, learning, and even watching games of chess. I'm also a fan of watching films; drama, comedy, thriller, you name it, I enjoy it.
Favorite Lab Moment:
That one time I did something so cool Nic ripped his shorts.
Andrew Xu
Year: Sophomore
Major: Biology
My absolute favorite thing to do in the world is to take a nap. I never quite get enough sleep as a pre-medical student. Of course, I still love studying for my science courses because I aspire to practice in the field of sports medicine. In between the long arduous hours at the library, I do enjoy training as a powerlifter in the gym and hunting for my next junk food fix. But, if you see me, I will love you very much if you can spare a cup of black coffee or an energy drink!
Favorite Lab Moment:
That one day Helen didn't hate me.
Nicolai Tayco
Year: Sophomore
Major: Biochemistry
Minor: Studio Art
My dream, aside from continuing research and going to medical school, is to is to pursue my love of art. I initially planned on droppping it after high school so I can focus on my major, but I just couldn't stay away from it. I've heard a lot of arguments for the discontinuation of art education in schools, but the arts and sciences go hand-in-hand more than people realize. I believe in a well-rounded education for future generations.
Favorite Lab Moment:
That one time Gouda did something so cool I ripped my shorts.
Tenzing Lama
Year: Senior
Major: Biochemistry
Minor: Chemistry
Hi! My name is Tenging Lama. After taking several upper level science courses, and working in an organic synthesis laboratory, I have developed a serious knack of learning more sciences, and I am extremely interested in pursuing my own independent research sometime in the future. In my free time, I like to get together with my good friends and travel to new exciting places.
Favorite Lab Moment:
“That’s it!” – Only few would understand this catchphrase!
Millicent Mulieri
Year: Sophomore
Major: Biochemistry
Minor: Political Science
My name is Millicent Mulieri, but I go by Millie. I am an active member of the Global Medical Brigades and plan on joining Doctors Without Borders upon completion of medical school. My ultimate goal is to set up free healthcare clinics throughout South America and provide medical care to all of those in need. A few of my hobbies include: playing soccer, singing, and making lame jokes.
Favorite Lab Moment:
When Greg finally admitted to us being best friends
(although some may doubt it ever happened).

The Undergraduates
Peyton Smith is a senior dual majoring in Biochemistry & Molecular Biology and Genetics. Otherwise known as ‘the Methanococcus guy’, Peyton has led the team as President and ran the Methanococcus lab for the past two iGEM seasons. He claims his favorite part about working in the lab is teaching the new iGEMers, but we really know he just enjoys torturing them with synthetic biology/Methanococcus trivia. His passion lies in developing new biological systems and his dream is to pursue a doctorate in bio-engineering. Outside of science, he enjoys running and good old fashioned SEC football.
Rebecca Buchanan is a senior who is dual majoring in Biochemistry & Molecular Biology and Cellular Biology with a minor in Religion. She has been a part of the UGA iGEM team since January and has become very invested in the team and research. Rebecca wants to apply to graduate school for regenerative medicine which she finds absolutely fascinating. When she isn't working in the lab, she enjoys playing tennis, going to concerts, and spending quality time with her cat .
My name is Mengyin Cheng, I am a senior majoring in Biochemical Engineering and I have been a member of the iGEM team for almost a year now. I have always loved metabolic engineering and the science behind it. The way genes can be manipulated to create the products that we desire is the part that I love the most about metabolic engineering and synthetic biology. This is what has brought me to join the group. Moreover, the product that we have produced has the ability to benefit several aspects of people’s life including the cosmetic and the oil industry. I have always wanted to give back to the society with the knowledge that I have acquired in college. In addition, I have several other interests such as dancing, singing, and drawing.
Kevin Moriles is a 4th year senior at the University of Georgia, majoring in Biological Science. After graduation, Kevin plans on applying to medical school to become a pediatrician. Kevin joined iGEM in 2013 and has been deeply involved ever since! When he is not studying or working on research, Kevin can be found reading or working out. Go DAWGS!!!!
Katelyn Snider is a 4th year Biology major from Roswell, GA. In addition to research, she also enjoys the outdoors and volunteer work. After graduation, Katelyn plans to pursue graduate school.
Brandon Burroway is a 4th year undergraduate student at UGA. He is majoring in Biology and minoring in Spanish. He is currently applying to medical school for entrance in Fall 2015. Brandon worked with the iGEM team throughout the Summer of 2013 and Spring 2014. Outside of research and class work, Brandon enjoys volunteering at the the Mercy Health Center and playing soccer at the University of Georgia.
The Instructors
Rachit Jain is a Doctoral Candidate at the University of Georgia pursuing Metabolic engineering research. He is also the founding member of UGA's iGEM team. Currently he is playing the role of an instructor for UGA's team.
Naga Sirisha is a graduate student pursing her PhD in Biological and agricultural engineering at the University of Georgia. Her involvement with biotechnology research began with her masters’ research on downstream processing for the purification of bacterial hyaluronic acid produced by the fermentation of genetically engineered lactococcus lactis at the Indian Institute of Technology Madras (India). Currently, her doctoral research interests are in the area of algal biofuels. She is working towards improving the yield and quality of algal biofuels produced by thermochemical and fermentation pathways using various pretreatments and component extraction methods.  Besides research, Sirisha pursues hobbies such as music, tennis, yoga and hiking.
Narendran Sekar got his master degree in Biotechnology in 2012 from Centre for Biotechnology, Anna University, Chennai, India. In his master program, he worked on flux balance analysis to optimize the production of recombinant protein in E. coli. He is currently a PhD student in Biological and Agricultural Engineering at the University of Georgia, Athens, GA, USA and doing his research in highly interdisciplinary field of bio-electrochemistry.  His major research work focusses on studying electrogenic characteristics of microorganisms such as cyanobacteria (Synechococcus elongatus) and hyperthermophilic archaea (Pyrococcus furiosus), and genetically manipulating their extracellular electron transfer capabilities for energy generation applications. He is instructing undergraduate students at UGA for the iGEM competition for the past two years.
Dr. Zhe Lyu. Postdoctoral research associate.  I have been working on methanogenic archaea encompassing their isolation, genomics, physiology and ecology since my doctoral studies.  I am currently involved in engineering Methanococcus maripaludis, an excellent model organism for methanogenic archaea to promote biogas production. Methanogenic archaea play vital roles in regulating our climate and quenching our thirst for clean energy, all because the one simple molecule they release – methane.  I believe that our research activities at UGA will enable better engineering and understanding of methanogenic archaea using synthetic biology, and prepare us for the grand challenges such as global warming and energy crisis.

iGEM Team attributions page
Each team must clearly attribute work done by the student team members on this page.  The team must distinguish work done by the students from work done by others, including the host labs, advisors, instructors, and individuals not on the team roster.
Why do we have this requirement?
Attribution Template
We have this requirement to help the judges know what you did yourselves and what you had help with. We don't mind if you get help with difficult or complex techniques, just be sure to report the work your team did and the work that was done by others.
For example, you might choose to work with an animal model during your project. Working with animals requires getting a license and applying far in advance to conduct certain experiments in many countries. This is something that is difficult to achieve during the course of a summer, but much easier if you can work with a postdoc or PI who has the right licenses.

Advisors
Cristina Vilanova
I am a biotechnologist currently doing my PhD at the Biotechnology and Synthetic Biology unit of the ICBiBE (UV). My work in the lab consists in implementing different systems biology - and ""omics"" - based approaches to the bioprospection of natural habitats.
Lucas J. Morales
I am a biotechnologist.
I am hardworking, cheerful, motivated and like to laugh. My hobbies are playing guitar, reading, watching series and computing.
I found very interesting the part of modeling applied to biology.
Tonny Ruiz
I am Multimedia Engineer. I'm currently working as researcher & software developer at LSyM-IRTIC (UV). I love the job well done,  design, creativity and innovation. In the future, I would like to continue researching in computer graphics for physically based environments.
Guillermo Zafrilla
Hi! I´m Guillermo Zafrilla Requena but everybody in lab calls me Zafri. I think that I´m a freak of technologic or mechanic devices like engines, computers, etc. I joined iGEM because I love doing science and designing new lab devices is a funny challenge for me. I´m very happy this year because it´s my first time as advisor in my team. My professional interests are industrial biotechnology, bioreactors and chemical engineering. I hope that my team will have good results in the Giant Jamboree at Boston!!
Instructors
Manel Porcar
I lead the Biotechnology and Synthetic Biology lab in the Cavanilles Institute (University of Valencia, Spain). I am the coordinator of the Valencia Biocampus Project. The competition is a very challenging experience; I have been involved in six iGEM editions. I believe that Synthetic Biology will experience many important changes in a close -and fascinating- future: engineering principles will not be taken for granted and evolutionary approaches might replace hype as the driving force of SynBio.
Juli Peretó
I am an evolutionary biochemist working at the University of Valencia, at the Cavanilles Institute for Biodiversity and Evolutionary Biology.  I try to teach metabolism to biotechnologists and I am a passionate of the studies on the origin of life and the history of the ideas on the natural origin and the artificial synthesis of life. The last three years I was the director of the international summer school “Origin, Evolution and Future of the Biosphere” (Erasmus Intensive Programme) and rencently I was named Fellow of the International Society for the Study of the Origin of Life.
Violeta Beltrán
As a lawyer, I specialize in Intellectual Property and Information  Technology. I used to work at the Spanish National Research Council (in Spanish, CSIC),  the largest public institution dedicated to research in Spain and the third  largest in Europe. In particular, I used to work at the Deputy Vice-presidency for  Knowledge Transfer in technology transfer issues. Currently I am the lead of the  Legal Affairs division at Biopolis, S.L., a biotech company and one of the few  spin-off companies of CSIC.
Daniel Ramón Vidal
I made my PhD working at the Dep. of Molecular Genetics of the pharmaceutical company Antibióticos S.A. Then I moved to the Univ. of Wageningen as a post-doc. I was Professor of Food Tech at CSIC and UV. Currently I am CEO of Biópolis S.L. My interests are microbial biotech and the production of microbial metabolites. I'm author of more than 100 articles and co-author of 30 patents. I've obtained the European Prize of Divulgation, the Prize of the Danone Institute, and the National Price in Technology Transfer.
Marta Tortajada
I am a chemical engineer, specialized in automatics and system engineering, particularly fond of systems biology.

Orthogonality Results
In Synthetic Biology, two constructions can be considered orthogonal when they only interact at specific and predictable interphases, and do not disturb     each other. We have studied this desirable feature of Biobrick parts by combining two constructions in the same cell and comparing this output with the one     produced by simple transformations. According to our experiments, that were carried out in two different E. coli strains, Biobrick parts do not     behave orthogonal when present in the same cell, being the expression of one of the parts 2 to 3 times higher than the other one. Then, we wanted to go un     step further: what is the effect of a simple transformation (a plasmid with a Biobrick part) into the cell architecture? To get some insights about this,     we are currently waiting for a proteomic analysis in which the whole proteome of an E. coli strain transformed with a Biobrick part will be     compared to that of the non-transformed, control strain.
General protocol
Strike the desired strains on LB plates with the appropriate antibiotic. Allow to grow by incubating at 37°C at least 24 hours.
Gather a large amount of bacteria with an inoculation loop and transfer to 1 mL of LB. Incubate during 20 minutes at room temperature.
Inoculate 100 µL of bacterial suspension in a tube containing 3 mL of LB with antibiotic. Perform three biological replicas of each combination of Biobrick     parts.
Incubate until OD600 is between 0.1-0.3.
Measure OD600.
Measure GFP fluorescence (exc.= 493nm; emis.=505nm) and RFP fluorescence (exc.= 576 nm; emis.= 592 nm) in a FP6200 spectrofluorimeter (Jasco, Easton, MD)     fluorometer using standard plastic cuvettes.
With excel, normalize fluorescence by cell density, calculate the average and standard deviation taking into account the three biological replicas, and     represent the data.
Results
We performed experiments with two different combinations of Biobrick parts containing a fluorescent protein under the control of a promoter sequence from     Anderson’s promoter collection: Bb1 (GFP with strong promoter J23104) + Bb2 (RFP with strong promoter J23104) and Bb2 + Bb3 (GFP with less strong promoter     J23110). In all cases, several controls were used: wild type (non-transformed) cells, simple transformations with either the biobrick or an empty plasmid,     and co-transformations of the biobricks and the empty plasmids. In all cases there was a high background emission of red fluorescence by the cells. Our     Results are shown in Figures 1 and 2.
Figure 1. Fluorescence emission in XL1-Blue E. coli strains co-expressing Biobrick parts 1, 2, and 3 reveals asymmetry of behaviors (lack of         orthogonality). Left, cells containing both Biobrick parts 1 and 2, Biobrick part 1 and an empty kanamycin plasmid (e.k.p), Biobrick part 2 and an empty ampicillin plasmid     (e.a.p.), Biobrick part 1, and Biobrick part 2. Right: Cells containing both Biobrick parts 2 and 3, Biobrick part 2 and an empty kanamycin plasmid     (e.k.p), Biobrick part 3 and an empty ampicillin plasmid (e.a.p.), Biobrick part 2, and Biobrick part 3. XL1-Blue E. coli cells containing no     plasmids or empty plasmids were used as controls. Both green (505 nm) and red (592 nm) fluorescence intensity (FI) were measured for all samples and     normalized by the optical density at 600 nm (OD600).
Figure 2. Fluorescence emission by DH5-α E. coli strains co-expressing Biobrick parts 1 and 2 also reveals non orthogonal expression of         Biobrick parts. Cells containing both Biobrick parts 1 and 2, Biobrick part 1 and an empty kanamycin plasmid (e.k.p), Biobrick part 2 and an empty ampicillin plasmid     (e.a.p.), Biobrick part 1, and Biobrick part 2 were analyzed. XL1-Blue E. coli cells containing no plasmids or empty plasmids were used as     controls. Both green (505 nm) and red (592 nm) fluorescence intensity (FI) were measured for all samples and normalized by the optical density at 600 nm     (OD600).
When in co-transformation, Bb1 and Bb2 showed a clearly asymmetric expression . Bb1 was highly expressed in comparison to Bb2 (2-fold in strain XL1-Blue and 3-fold in DH5α). A     similar phenomenon was observed when either Bb1 or Bb2 were cotransformed with empty plasmids. Again, less fluorescence was detected in comparison to the     simple transformants. Surprisingly, this fluorescence decay was strikingly different between both E. coli strains: Bb1 strongly lowered its     expression in DH5α, whereas Bb2 showed a higher decay in XL1-Blue cells.
However, the result was completely different when Bb2 and Bb3 were present in the same cell. In the XL1-Blue strain, the fluorescence intensity of Bb2 was     as high as that of the single transformant, whereas the fluorescence of Bb3 –containing a less strong promoter- dropped dramatically. Fluorescence     intensity of Bb3 was not detectable in strain DH5α under our experimental conditions.
With these results with co-transformants, we have to conclude that Biobrick parts, even if controlled by the same promoter and cloned into the same         plasmid, are not expressed at similar rates. But, is this lack of orthogonality stable? In other words, is the asymmetric output always the same or it fluctuates depending on the culture? We designed     a second experiment to answer this question. By performing several subcultures of the co-transformant strains -with five independent replica of each- and     measuring the fluorescence output of each replicate after the subculturing steps, we will check whether fluorescence asymmetry is stable. On the other     hand, we have only studied the average fluorescence in a population of cells in our experiments… but what are the variations between single cells? A simple     experiment using flow cytometry can help us solve this question…

Hi! I´m Guillermo Zafrilla Requena but everybody in lab calls me Zafri. I think that I´m a freak of technologic or mechanic devices like engines, computers, etc. I joined iGEM because I love doing science and designing new lab devices is a funny challenge for me. I´m very happy this year because it´s my first time as advisor in my team. My professional interests are industrial biotechnology, bioreactors and chemical engineering. I hope that my team will have good results in the Giant Jamboree at Boston!!
Instructors
Manel Porcar
I lead the Biotechnology and Synthetic Biology lab in the Cavanilles Institute (University of Valencia, Spain). I am the coordinator of the Valencia Biocampus Project. The competition is a very challenging experience; I have been involved in six iGEM editions. I believe that Synthetic Biology will experience many important changes in a close -and fascinating- future: engineering principles will not be taken for granted and evolutionary approaches might replace hype as the driving force of SynBio.
Juli Peretó
I am an evolutionary biochemist working at the University of Valencia, at the Cavanilles Institute for Biodiversity and Evolutionary Biology.  I try to teach metabolism to biotechnologists and I am a passionate of the studies on the origin of life and the history of the ideas on the natural origin and the artificial synthesis of life. The last three years I was the director of the international summer school “Origin, Evolution and Future of the Biosphere” (Erasmus Intensive Programme) and rencently I was named Fellow of the International Society for the Study of the Origin of Life.
Violeta Beltrán
As a lawyer, I specialize in Intellectual Property and Information  Technology. I used to work at the Spanish National Research Council (in Spanish, CSIC),  the largest public institution dedicated to research in Spain and the third  largest in Europe. In particular, I used to work at the Deputy Vice-presidency for  Knowledge Transfer in technology transfer issues. Currently I am the lead of the  Legal Affairs division at Biopolis, S.L., a biotech company and one of the few  spin-off companies of CSIC.
Daniel Ramón Vidal
I made my PhD working at the Dep. of Molecular Genetics of the pharmaceutical company Antibióticos S.A. Then I moved to the Univ. of Wageningen as a post-doc. I was Professor of Food Tech at CSIC and UV. Currently I am CEO of Biópolis S.L. My interests are microbial biotech and the production of microbial metabolites. I'm author of more than 100 articles and co-author of 30 patents. I've obtained the European Prize of Divulgation, the Prize of the Danone Institute, and the National Price in Technology Transfer.

iGEM Team attributions page
Each team must clearly attribute work done by the student team members on this page.  The team must distinguish work done by the students from work done by others, including the host labs, advisors, instructors, and individuals not on the team roster.
Why do we have this requirement?
Attribution Template
We have this requirement to help the judges know what you did yourselves and what you had help with. We don't mind if you get help with difficult or complex techniques, just be sure to report the work your team did and the work that was done by others.
For example, you might choose to work with an animal model during your project. Working with animals requires getting a license and applying far in advance to conduct certain experiments in many countries. This is something that is difficult to achieve during the course of a summer, but much easier if you can work with a postdoc or PI who has the right licenses.
A great example of complete attribution comes from the Imperial College London 2011 team (scroll down to the bottom of their team page to see attributions).
Here are some of the fields we recommend you have on this page. If there are other areas not listed below, but applicable to your team/project, please feel free to also list them on your attributions page. Please feel free to remove any areas not applicable to your project.
General Support
Project support and advice
Fundraising help and advice
Lab support
Difficult technique support
Project advisor support
Wiki support
Presentation coaching
Policy & Practices support
Thanks and acknowledgements for all other people involved in helping make a successful iGEM team.

Wang Mengni
I major in the science of biology in Agriculture University as an undergraduate and take up Applied Mathematics as a second degree. I dream to study biological science with the help of the essence of mathematics and do something big of innovation and originality in science. I am enthusiastic at volunteering and work as the captain of volunteers of the college biological science in my university in 2013-2014. My hobbies are watching movies, painting ,playing badminton and chess. What distinguishes me most-smiling.
Li Chen
Li Chen, a student of Honors Class in CAU, majoring in life science. With a great interest in biology experiments, she started to learn experimental skills in a lab about genetics and molecular biology at the beginning of the sophomore year. At the meantime, she became an iGEMer of CAU. Swimming, singing and drawing are her hobbies for relaxing. She always believes that everything done is worthy.

Hi, guys, I am CHEN Li, a student from China Agriculture University. I am happy to be a member of CAU_China, and I learned a lot from the big game. I make some good friends in this game. No matter how hard problems we meet, I hope we can enjoy it and make it! Wish CAU and CAU_China a bright future! Let’s make it!
Wu You
Hi, my name is You and nice to see you. Maybe I’m a mix of Wendy, Dorothy, Anne and Alice from those cute storybooks so every day I discover more and more beautiful things. And books, pictures and other artworks are always on my mind. I’m responsible for the art related works and other interesting missions (e.g. asking questions) in our team. It’s a joy to work in our team since everyone wants this summer to be special and We Are Smart :D
Li Kai
I’m Likai, from College of Biology, China Agricultural University. This is my second year in CAU-iGEM-team. In the first year, I learned some useful experiment skills which were used for the project this year. After varies of mistakes in experiment, I have become a skillful senior in biobrick construction. Our team will be more diversification when the freshmen participating in and it will blossom as its members grow to maturity. Reading and sports is my favourite in spare time and these benefit me a lot. “Never focus on short-run profit” is my principle when I am working.
Guo Shuchen
Hi, I’m Shuchen Guo, from CAU igem team. I study biological science and I’m now a senior student. Having joined in CAU igem for two years, I have enjoyed a happy time with my teammates.

I am Qi-Jun Chen, a faculty from China Agricultural University. I am happy to have the opportunity as one of advisors of CAU_China iGEM team. I learned a lot about iGEM from the team, and shared a variety of wonderful ideas. I hope to provide more and useful suggestions, as well as technical supports, for the team in the future.
Wang Na
CAU_China is a family. Everyone learns, thinks, discusses, and has fun in this family. I learn fresh ideas from all members. Most of the time, I feel like a happy student more than an instructor. And synthetic biology brings me so much surprise and fun. As a teacher, I hope students to explore more fields and pay more attention to the effects on life.  Synthetic biology can change the world! But I have so much regret in this year. I don’t have enough time to talk with team members. I don’t pay more attention to the latest advances. But I will not change the belief that we can make more beautiful life by synthetic biology!

iGEM Team attributions page
Each team must clearly attribute work done by the student team members on this page.  The team must distinguish work done by the students from work done by others, including the host labs, advisors, instructors, and individuals not on the team roster.
Why do we have this requirement?
Attribution Template
We have this requirement to help the judges know what you did yourselves and what you had help with. We don't mind if you get help with difficult or complex techniques, just be sure to report the work your team did and the work that was done by others.
For example, you might choose to work with an animal model during your project. Working with animals requires getting a license and applying far in advance to conduct certain experiments in many countries. This is something that is difficult to achieve during the course of a summer, but much easier if you can work with a postdoc or PI who has the right licenses.
A great example of complete attribution comes from the Imperial College London 2011 team (scroll down to the bottom of their team page to see attributions).
Here are some of the fields we recommend you have on this page. If there are other areas not listed below, but applicable to your team/project, please feel free to also list them on your attributions page. Please feel free to remove any areas not applicable to your project.

Meet the team!
Tiffany Kwakwa
Tiffany loves french fries and the colors pink and sea foam green.  She is a rising junior studying Environmental Engineering and how to recycle and reuse everything.  In her spare time she can be found in bakeries or drinking tea.
Kristi Lui
Kristi has an odd sense of humor and is basically the wild child.  When not pipetting, she’s usually watching one of many TV shows (but mainly Dexter) or studying for the MCAT.
Mitch Perkins
Mitch is a potential Anthropology major, but currently focusing on Biology.  Constantly greeting team members with a “Yo!” and sharing pictures of his dog, there is no one else as chill, except maybe the -80 fridge.
Sharon Chen
When not studying for the MCAT, Sharon is in the lab or sleeping.  Mainly sleeping.  A rising senior Art History and Biology major, she loves cherries and expensive oatmeal.
David Lee
David is a rising star who has also risen into our hearts with his wit and charm.  The other departments are jealous that he chose Biomedical Engineering.  His only vice is his addiction to Game of Thrones, finishing 10 episodes in one night after returning from a day at the lab.
Adam Baker
Adam is a bassist and speed reader, going through multiple books in one sitting as well as the technical papers related to our project.  He’s a rising junior Chemical Engineer who we fall back on for knowledge and fact recollection.
Abdullah Memon
Abdullah has been graced with the gift of amazing handwriting and tasteful quips.  He’s a rising junior on a pre-med track to saving lives and making fat stacks.

iGEM Team attributions page
Each team must clearly attribute work done by the student team members on this page.  The team must distinguish work done by the students from work done by others, including the host labs, advisors, instructors, and individuals not on the team roster.
Why do we have this requirement?
Attribution Template
We have this requirement to help the judges know what you did yourselves and what you had help with. We don't mind if you get help with difficult or complex techniques, just be sure to report the work your team did and the work that was done by others.
For example, you might choose to work with an animal model during your project. Working with animals requires getting a license and applying far in advance to conduct certain experiments in many countries. This is something that is difficult to achieve during the course of a summer, but much easier if you can work with a postdoc or PI who has the right licenses.
A great example of complete attribution comes from the Imperial College London 2011 team (scroll down to the bottom of their team page to see attributions).
Here are some of the fields we recommend you have on this page. If there are other areas not listed below, but applicable to your team/project, please feel free to also list them on your attributions page. Please feel free to remove any areas not applicable to your project.

The Story-Technion

UT-Dallas
Collaboration with the Technion iGEM group
Detection of allergens and toxins in food and water has been one of the  most major global challenges in recent years, mainly because its detection must  be done at very low concentrations. In order to tackle this challenge, the  Technion-Israel team is designing a bio-sensor system that can accurately  identify a substance of interest at extremely low concentrations. The system  consists of E.Coli Top 10 bacteria which are able to sense the presence of a  specific substance and process the signal to produce a green light. In order  for the green light to be visible to the naked eye, the system involves a  quorum sensing-based acyl homoserine lactone (AHL) signal as well.
The AHL  signal is passed on from one E.Coli to its neighbors in order for them to  follow suit, causing a chain reaction which enables the magnification of the  green light signal.
To  determine whether their E.Coli Top 10 bacteria do produce and secrete AHL, we  offered to characterize their system using the reporter strain chromobacterium violecium 26 (CV026) which we have in our lab. In the presence of AHL, CV026 produce a  characteristic purple dye marker. In a qualitative experiment that we conducted  by seeding their E.Coli Top 10 on soft agar and LB agar plates containing  CV026, we found that their bacteria do produce AHL as a result of purple  colonies that appeared on the agar plates. Such result helped the  Technion-Israel team to insure that their system does secrete the AHL signal.

Supervisor
Smadar Cohen
Prof. Smadar Cohen from the Avram and Stella Goldstein-Goren Department of Biotechnology Engineering, Ben Gurion University, received her BSc, MSc and PhD (Biophysics) from Tel Aviv University, and went on to a postdoctoral fellowship at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (with Prof. Robert Langer). Prof. Cohen’s research explores several areas in modern biotechnology, from designing of instructive biomaterials   for inducing tissue regeneration and tissue engineering ex- and in-vivo to implementation of intelligent delivery systems for therapeutic peptides and proteins. AlgiMatrix– a scaffold for 3-D cell culture – has been developed in her group and has been licensed and developed into a product by Invitrogen Corporation (Carlsbad, California). Prof. Cohen also developed BL-1040, an alginate-based biomaterial for treating acute myocardial infarction (in clinical phase I /II study).
Us As a Team
Our team started with 10 students, strangers to each other, trying to build a project together. We came from different departments in Ben-Gurion University, each one of us with his role in the group, and all of us together with a lot of motivation and one main goal- to come with the best project as iGEM BGU 2014 team. Soon we found that each one of us could learn how to help the others and outreach his specific role. We consulted, helped and enjoyed each other's company during the way.
We have learned that working together as a team can earn us some amazing friends and take our project to new heights.
We had a great time and we are proud of the outcome.

Meet the team
Our team comprises 13 students from TU Delft, Leiden University and Rotterdam University. We are a multi-national         team with very diverse backgrounds, including biology, physics and industrial design. Thus, we are well equipped to         tackle the broad range of challenges that will occur during our iGEM project!

Tomek Diederen
Function: Science Manager
Nationality: Dutch
Background: Biochemistry and Biotechnology
February this year I was cleaned out from under my bridge, and heard that the TU Delft iGEM project offered shelter in a lab  during the summer months. Turns out iGEM was a project about synthetic biology where I was allowed total freedom in the way I would like to conduct research! Unlike other lab-experiences, I could design experiments and then conduct these trying to prove outlandishly wild ideas and literally exploring the (redox)-potential of that bug that governs my gut-feeling: E.coli. Because of the large amount of team-members from other disciplines, and because of the duration of the project I learned a lot about working in a team. I learned the difficulty of communicating science to laymen, and the utter importance of doing so.
Anne van der Meij
Function: Science Manager
Nationality: Dutch
Background: Microbial Biotechnology
The invisible world of microbes has always been fascinating to me. As a result I am a master student in Microbial Biotechnology. On my way discovering the little life I met synthetic biology. The creation of new biological systems is an exciting area of research and the iGEM competition is a major opportunity to perform this cutting edge research. For ELECTRACE I am mainly involved in experimental design and  lab work. I am especially triggered by the challenges regarding the implementation of the extracellular electron transport pathway in E. coli.  It is a great experience to do this with students who are all motivated to accomplish our goals and it is extremely exciting to match modelling results with lab results. It showed that the outcome of complex pathways can be determined by only a few parameters. This motivated me to take mathematical biology courses.  The interdisciplinary character of iGEM is an incredible advantage for science!
Sim Castle
Function: Gadget building manager
Nationality: English/Finnish
Background: Industrial Design Engineering
I am an industrial designer currently in my first year of master’s at TU Delft. Most designers haven’t even heard of synthetic biology (terrible, right!?), but ever since I first read an article about its potential a couple of years ago I have been excited by the future products it could bring. Synthetic biology is on the brink of being the technological revolution of the 21st century, and I want to be part of bringing that revolution to the masses!  iGem is just the start...
Mariëlle van Kooten
Function: Science Manager
Nationality: Dutch
Background: Molecular and Cellular Biology
Background
I am currently enrolled in one of several MSc programmes Life Science and Technology at Leiden University.
Interests
Why join the iGEM 2014 TU Delft team? My interests are, amongst others, signal transduction mechanisms and signaling networks. These and other aspects lead to an interest in synthetic biology: to develop a minimal cell, understand the fundamentals of biology and begin the process of building a new cell and organism with optimized functions. To me, the complexity and opportunities in the field of molecular and cellular systems are amazingly challenging and the possibility of building biological systems and operating them in living cells is, in my opinion, grand. On a different level, I would like to explore approaching challenges multidisciplinary, creating a dynamic get-together in which it is possible to optimize existing strategies and consider new leads. I am keen to bring things to the next level in collaborations.
Project Electrace Marked as fundamentally challenging, implementation of pathways for extracellular electron transport in Escherichia coli has been immensely motivating. (Modeling and) In-depth understanding of metabolic fluxes and improving and optimizing relevant (chemistry of) proteins continue to pose an incredible challenge.
Cristy Verzijl
Function: Lab manager
Nationality: Dutch
Background: Biology and Medical laboratory research
Hi! I’m Cristy Verzijl and I am studying in my final year of the Bachelor’s degree in Biology and Medical Laboratory research in Rotterdam. I'm also involved in the Honors Program for a second degree, in which I'm doing a lot of projects. I am planning to study veterinary medicine or science and business management next year. I love hiking, running and swimming but I also love challenges, like iGEM. The creation of new biological systems is an amazing process and I’m very grateful that I can be involved in this world of technology by participating in iGEM. ELECTRACE is an project where complex pathways are implemented in E. coli, and that was a big challenge for our team.  iGEM TU Delft 2014 is truly a multidisciplinary team and that is a great advantage for our project, where biology and technology come close together. I find it especially interesting to see whether the modeling results match with the results from the lab.
Duco Blanken
Function: Policy & Practice manager
Nationality: Dutch
Background: Applied Physics
Hi, my name is Duco. Im 22 years old and I live in Delft. I´ve done a bachelor in applied physics and I´m currently doing an applied physics master with a focus on bionanoscience. In this iGEM project, my main role is that of Policy&Practice manager, which comes down to me having a lot of interesting discussions with various stakeholders during the summer. Besides my P&P job, I've been involved in the modeling and characterization parts of our project. I've really enjoyed my participation in iGEM, and I can't wait to tell other iGEM teams about our awesome project at the jamboree.
Mathijs Rozemuller
Function: Modeling Manager
Nationality: Dutch
Background: Applied Physics
Why does this dude join iGEM when he studies applied physics? Well, because synthetic biology is awesome of course. I was (and still am) attracted by the idea of, with total freedom I must add, defining a project together and then actually realizing it. Furthermore, I especially enjoy working in a multidisciplinary team. As physicist you only work alone in dark windowless rooms, so there is no group experience. What I've been involved with the most is modelling with Anton and Duco. You will find most of my work in the curli modelling page. Other information you might want to know is that I am 22 years and that I focus my master on both bionanoscience and (acoustical) imaging.
Joan Cortada García
Function: Safety and Science manager
Nationality: Spanish
Background: Biotechnology
I'm Joan and I have studied a Bachelor's degree in Biotechnology in the area of my natal city, Barcelona. I am currently studying at TU Delft a Master of Science in Biochemical Engineering. I really like travelling, taking pictures, eating nice food and playing the piano. Regarding iGEM, I have been involved together with Tomek, Mariëlle and Anne in the decision making of scientific matters; as well as taking responsibility of the safety issues with the collaboration of Anamaria.
Anamaria Buda
Function: Team Leader
Nationality: Romanian
Background: Management of Technology
My interest in the advancements and new trends of technology, along with my diligence, inherent curiosity and motivation, determined me to be part of this iGEM team.   I find this competition challenging from the point of view of the interdisciplinary elements  that it offers. I am intrigued by how basic engineering concepts are combined with biology.  Being part of this team, was a great experience that helped me to expand my knowledge on synthetic biology, while exercising my abilities to work  in an international team and to deal with a novel and multidisciplinary project.
Janna Bogers
Function: Fundraising and PR
Nationality: Dutch
Background: Nanobiology
My name is Janna and with 19 years of age I am (by far) the youngest member of the team.      Currently I am in my third year of a Bachelor’s degree in Nanobiology,      which combines physics and biology to gain a deeper understanding of life at the nanoscale.      I joined the iGEM team of the TU Delft because I saw it as a true challenge for myself,      especially because of the multidisciplinary setting.      In this project I have learned lots of practical aspects in conducting research,      opposed to the theoretical aspects I have learned about in my studies so far.      My role in the iGEM project has been PR and fundraising manager,      but I soon found myself to be in the lab rather than contacting media.      So in the end my biggest contributions have been in fundraising and labwork,      where I worked on cloning and characterization of the conductive curli module.
Esra Bekdas
Function: Manager Illustration
Nationality: Dutch-born to Turkish parents
Background: Biology and Medical Laboratory Research / Life Sciences
Hi! My name is Esra Bekdas. I am currently studying in my final year of Biology and Medical Laboratory Research Engineer (BSc.) with a focus on Life Sciences at the Rotterdam University of Applied Sciences (Hogeschool Rotterdam). Besides my study I’m also involved in the honors program to achieve a second degree. In this iGEM project I have been involved in different parts e.g. Graphic design, PR, fundraising and lab work… In my main role as graphic designer I have tried to visualize several parts of the project. Special thanks to my teammates which I have learned a lot from!
Anton Pols
Function: Modeling Manager
Nationality: Dutch
Background: Applied Physics and Electrical Engineering
Hi, I am Anton. Currently, I am doing a Masters in Applied Physics and I finished my Bachelors in Electrical Engineering, both at Delft University of Technology. My responsibilities were managing the modeling efforts of our team together with Mathijs. I did a lot of modeling myself as well. Also, I helped with fundraising and coding of our wiki. I am really looking forward to presenting our results at the Giant Jamboree in Boston, as well as learning about the work other iGEM teams did. By the way, I also have five fingers on my left hand in case you were wondering! :) (see group picture above)
Debarghya Ghosh (Debu)
Function: Social chair
Nationality: Indian
Background: Mechanical and control engineering
Hi, I am doing a masters in Control Engineering at the Delft Centre for Systems & Control (DCSC), TU Delft. I have been actively involved in building the Potentiostat and microfluidics along with Simeon. I enjoy Science fiction and specifically authors like Dan Brown ,Michael Chrichton etc. I used to play the keyboard/piano although I have definitely lost touch. i-GEM was a good experience where I got exposed to many devices and gadgets that I frankly did-not even imagine existed in our university.I shall miss the fun once we are done!

Anamaria -Team leader
Has been setting-up the team, has created the timeline and had on overview on the main deadlines, established the communication channels for the team,  has facilitated the general meetings (more than 60 in total), ensured the communication flow between the team members, advisors and other related stakeholders and supervised the overall activity of the team. In addition, she was organizing the mid-term presentations of our project, took care of all the practicalities in participating in DIG-it event and other related iGEM  related events.  She was a key member in the fundraising process (by contributing to the content of our booklet, contacted companies, departments and other organizations), and was actively involved in the Policy& Practice department. Next, she provided support in writing the safety report, coding wiki page and helped other departments (ie. measuring set-up for the curli resistance) and performed small lab tasks.
Anne - Science Manager
Literature study on Electron Transport, Conductive Curli and Landmine Detection to make a general experimental set-up.  Develop cloning strategies including primer design for the Electron Transport, Conductive Curli and Landmine Detection modules.  Cloning of BioBricks, including the Golden Gate Assembly for the BioBricks in the Electron Transport and Conductive Curli modules.  Characterization of the Electron Transport BioBricks.
Anton - Modeling Manager
My responsibilities were managing the modeling efforts of our team together with Mathijs. I did a lot of modeling myself as well, mainly FBA and Graph Theory. Also, I helped with fundraising and coding of our wiki. Besides that, I actively participated in a lot of discussions and actively co-operated with the life science department. Lastly, I edited a lot of texts and implemented them on the wiki.
Cristy - Lab Manager
My personal contribution in the beginning of the project was reading articles and help with the implementation of ideas. During the project, I was also concerned with the understanding of the experimental processes and experimental setup. In the lab, I was mainly focused on the ET module. For this module and partly for the other modules, I did a lot of cloning and transformations. I was also involved in the characterization of the ET module and the implementation of these results.  As a lab manager, one activity is taking care of the organization in the lab, so that everyone could work efficiently. Another activity was organizing labmeetings for the people who worked in the lab, to keep each other updated about the labwork. I also wrote a lot of protocols and wrote about the ET module for the wiki page. Outside the science and lab part, I also was involved in the fundraising process by contacting companies and organizations.
Debu - Social Manager
Initially I was involved with the modeling work and then during the summer my focus shifted towards designing the hardware and software for the potentiostat. With the help of Sim the potentiostat became a physical reality due to his extraordinary dexterity in recognizing /dealing with practical electronic hardware components .I assisted Sim with the design of the Drop Sens Micro-fluidic device more at a conceptual level while Sim mostly handled the actual fabrication. Me and Tomek were involved in performing experiments which proved the validity of the new microfluidic device along with various characterization experiments of the ET module. Finally I was involved in my own sort of 'fundraising' as I convinced AutoLab Metrohm to provide us (free of cost) with a box of DropSens screen printed electrodes which were later on embedded into the microfluidic device. In addition to this they also provided us with Gold plated Inter-Digitated electrodes (IDE) for the Curli resistance measurement and a commercial potentiostat which was used as the standard device used during characterization.
Duco – Policy&Practice Manager
In my role as Policy&Practice Manager, I conducted interviews with BDS,KMRD,EODD, and PAX and wrote the respective reports. Besides that, I’ve prepared, presented at, and reported on the RIVM meeting. I conducted the “Desk study concerning landmines” and I’ve written the Policy&Practice wikipages Overview, ELECTRACE, Outlook, and Outreach (except “Dutch National Meet-up”). Also, I prepared the stand at the Zomerfestival. Besides my P&P efforts, I’ve been involved in the modeling of the Landmine Module, the Deterministic Model of EET Complex Assembly, and, to a lesser degree, the FBA. I’ve also written the piece Techniques#DeterministicTheory. As for characterization, I’ve converted most of the raw data to figures.
Janna - PR and Fundraising Manager
As PR and fundraising manager, I have worked on fundraising a lot during the initial months of the project. A large part of the fundraising was also the budget, on which I worked quite a lot. I also helped Duco with the preparations for the Zomerfestival and gave workshops for kids at the event itself. As soon as the labwork got going, however, I spent most of my time in the lab helping out with cloning of the three different modules. Later on in the summer, my focus shifted to the Golden Gate cloning and characterization of the Conductive Curli module. The labwork I did by myself was the collaboration with Wageningen, on which I spent some time in the lab as well. During the project I noticed that my PR job was not meant for me and therefore others mostly took over this job.
Joan – Science Manager and Safety Manager
Actively participated in the design of the BioBricks and in the development of the cloning strategies to obtain them. Primer design, including the primers for the Golden Gate Assembly method. Development of all sorts of molecular biology work required for the development of our BioBricks in the lab. Worked on the preparation and analysis of the sequencing samples of the received and created BioBricks. Kept in contact with former TU Delft iGEM students to prepare and send samples to collaborate with other iGEM teams. Development and performance of the Characterisation of the Landmine Detection module BioBricks (plate reader and FACS), as well as performance of some of the experiments for the Characterisation of the Conductive Curli module (plate reader and Confocal microscopy). Registered and provided a description of all the constructed BioBricks on the Parts Registry. Development of the Safety Protocol required for the permission of the Safety Manager of TU Delft Applied Sciences faculty to work with certain chemical compounds.
Mariëlle
Personal contributions to the underlying project center on an exploratory literature study of carbon metabolism and protein chemistry with respect to (extracellular) electron transport as well as implementation of experimental techniques regarding, amongst others, cloning. These techniques include handling DNA and genes as discrete elements, put into practice by cloning within the Modules Electron Transport, Conductive Curli and Landmine Detection. Activities covered understanding experimental processes and subsequently improving experimental setup, transforming one species of bacteria to another followed by exploration of (new / gained) functions and overall: approaching challenges multidisciplinary.
Sim - Gadget Manager
At the start of the project, I was responsible for facilitating brainstorming for project ideas. Graphic design for logos, posters, and other promotional material was also under my domain. As the gadget manager,  my main responsibility was for the design and exploration of the gadget - this included design and prototyping of the potentiostat, which was carried out with fellow team mate, Debu. A future concept for the application of the Electrace bio-sensor into a product-service system was also designed by myself. During later stages of the project, I was most heavily involved with microfluidics. This involved the fabrication of mother machines, as well as the design of a microfluidic device that includes electrodes along side fellow team mate tomek. Prototyping of the device was performed by myself. Finally, I also had a role in characterisation - this included co-design  and running (with Tomek) of the bio-reactor, and imaging of cells in the Mother Machines in the fluorescence microscope.
Tomek – Science manager
In preparation for the summer I was involved in the study of literature on the ET and CC modules. I was involved in the design of the biobricks and cloning routes used to obtain them as well as the cloning-experiments themselves. I was responsible for the design and manufacturing of the Dropsens fluidics (DS) device, the paper microfluidics and for the manufacturing of the Mother Machine (MM) as well as the use of the MM and DS in experiments. I designed, wrote protocols, reported on and performed the bioreactor, congo red, crystal violet and Gold Nanoparticle experiments. I prepared and attended the RIVM meeting and the BDS interview together with Duco.

iGEM Team attributions page
Each team must clearly attribute work done by the student team members on this page.  The team must distinguish work done by the students from work done by others, including the host labs, advisors, instructors, and individuals not on the team roster.
Why do we have this requirement?
Attribution Template
We have this requirement to help the judges know what you did yourselves and what you had help with. We don't mind if you get help with difficult or complex techniques, just be sure to report the work your team did and the work that was done by others.
For example, you might choose to work with an animal model during your project. Working with animals requires getting a license and applying far in advance to conduct certain experiments in many countries. This is something that is difficult to achieve during the course of a summer, but much easier if you can work with a postdoc or PI who has the right licenses.
A great example of complete attribution comes from the Imperial College London 2011 team (scroll down to the bottom of their team page to see attributions).
Here are some of the fields we recommend you have on this page. If there are other areas not listed below, but applicable to your team/project, please feel free to also list them on your attributions page. Please feel free to remove any areas not applicable to your project.
General Support
Project support and advice
Fundraising help and advice
Lab support
Difficult technique support
Project advisor support
Wiki support
Presentation coaching
Policy & Practices support
Thanks and acknowledgements for all other people involved in helping make a successful iGEM team.

Qing Zhang
In iGEM hust, I’ve experienced how to consummate an idea, how to complete a task using my own mind. To construct a plasmid with Ompc and CBP/His, approximately 3 months was spent because of a tiny error; for the growth curves of E. coli with vectors containing different genes, we worked all day. One year, we worked together for one aim. To my team members, my dear friends, I’d like to say lucky to be with you.
Lei  Yin
I am a junior in biotechnology now. In the team, I am responsible for constructing the anchor protein-copper chelation vectors and planning our Human Practice.

I was a sophomore in bio-science when I became a member of iGEMers. Now I am still a sophomore in BME. As an experiment members in the team, most of my work is about Human Practice and Future Work. I like traveling and reading, and my idol is Steven Jobs.
Yuanxin  Wang
I’m a senior student in biomedical science. And this is the second year for me to be an iGEMer. Although most of my classes tells me how to be a good experimentalist, I’m in charge of modelling part in the team. Most of my work is transforming the biological process into a mathematical model and doing some data analysis. I enjoy reading and listening to soft music in my spare time. Besides, I’m always dreaming to have enough time to paint a picture about the school to memorize the four years I've spent.
Ruihao Li
Now I major bioscience in the Life School of Huazhong University of Sci & Tec. I have taken part in the mathematical modelling and human practice. It may sound a little unusual that I'm a member of software which has nothing to do with my major. But I love mathematical modeling and programming.
Yiwen Ping
It’s my first time as an iGEMer. In the team, I am responsible for the art design, so we communicate frequently to get all opinions. It’s great to be with all the members here.
Huabin Wang
I am a senior student from school of Enivronmental Science and Engineering. I am in charge of the design of equipment and drawing some schematics. I believe our work is meaningful and extremely useful. As the old Chinese saying goes, where there is a will, there is a way.

I am a junior in bioinformatics. And in  this team, I am a member of wet lab group. I participated in the work of  cyanide part and growth curve. I learnt a lot in the whole year teamwork--a  crazy heart for the project and the hard work for final result. iGEM is a great  platform for us to play with biology. So just imagine ,and you will make it.  Beside this, I love singing.

Yuanxin Wang
I’m a senior student in biomedical science.  And this is the second year for me to be an iGEMer. Although most of my classes  tells me how to be a good experimentalist, I’m in charge of modelling part in  the team. Most of my work is transforming the biological process into a  mathematical model and doing some data analysis. I enjoy reading and listening  to soft music in my spare time. Besides, I’m always dreaming to have enough  time to paint a picture about the school to memorize the four years I've spent.

Attributions
iGEM Team attributions page
Each team must clearly attribute work done by the student team members on this page.  The team must distinguish work done by the students from work done by others, including the host labs, advisors, instructors, and individuals not on the team roster.
Why do we have this requirement?
Attribution Template
We have this requirement to help the judges know what you did yourselves and what you had help with. We don't mind if you get help with difficult or complex techniques, just be sure to report the work your team did and the work that was done by others.
For example, you might choose to work with an animal model during your project. Working with animals requires getting a license and applying far in advance to conduct certain experiments in many countries. This is something that is difficult to achieve during the course of a summer, but much easier if you can work with a postdoc or PI who has the right licenses.
A great example of complete attribution comes from the Imperial College London 2011 team (scroll down to the bottom of their team page to see attributions).
Here are some of the fields we recommend you have on this page. If there are other areas not listed below, but applicable to your team/project, please feel free to also list them on your attributions page. Please feel free to remove any areas not applicable to your project.
General Support
Project support and advice
Fundraising help and advice
Lab support
Difficult technique support
Project advisor support
Wiki support
Presentation coaching
Policy & Practices support
Thanks and acknowledgements for all other people involved in helping make a successful iGEM team.

In  iGEM hust, I’ve experienced how to consummate a idea, how to complete a task  using my own mind. For constructing a plasmid with Ompc and CBP/His,  approximately 3 months was spent because of a tiny error; for the growth curves  of E. coli with vectors containing different genes, we work all day. One year,  we worked together for one aim. To my team members, my dear friends, I’d like  to say lucky to be with you.

I was a senior in HUST and it’s my first  time as an iGEMer. In the team, I am responsible for the art design including  the web, poster, team uniform and something else. When I designed the team  logo, I have wavered over whether to take advise from my teammates or to insist  my own opinion. I'm not good at making a decision but I will try to get more  experience and patience in the teamwork.

Attributions
iGEM Team attributions page
Each team must clearly attribute work done by the student team members on this page.  The team must distinguish work done by the students from work done by others, including the host labs, advisors, instructors, and individuals not on the team roster.
Why do we have this requirement?
Attribution Template
We have this requirement to help the judges know what you did yourselves and what you had help with. We don't mind if you get help with difficult or complex techniques, just be sure to report the work your team did and the work that was done by others.
For example, you might choose to work with an animal model during your project. Working with animals requires getting a license and applying far in advance to conduct certain experiments in many countries. This is something that is difficult to achieve during the course of a summer, but much easier if you can work with a postdoc or PI who has the right licenses.
A great example of complete attribution comes from the Imperial College London 2011 team (scroll down to the bottom of their team page to see attributions).
Here are some of the fields we recommend you have on this page. If there are other areas not listed below, but applicable to your team/project, please feel free to also list them on your attributions page. Please feel free to remove any areas not applicable to your project.

Contributions & Acknowledgements
Contributions
We are a group of biologists, biotechnologists, bioengineers and bioinformaticians. This project has been done by us students, from the definition of problem statement to designing and conducting experiments, modeling and designing the Wiki . Although the work was shared, from the beginning we assigned each group member with the responsibility for a particular task. Daniel was responsible for the lab, Maximilian for the sponsoring and the chip design, Nadine for administrative work and biobricks, Stefanie for human practice and the lab practical work; Elise for the model, Claude for the Wiki and for the diffusion model, Sumana for the updates on iGEM website and for model simulations.
However, we would not have been able to realise our project without the help and support of some important people. We dedicate this page to thank and acknowledge the contributions of these people. We would like to thank all our advisors and professors for their constant support and assistance during the course of the project. We would also like to thank everyone else who has helped us either with materials or through their invaluable advice. The acknowledgements are presented in detail below.
Acknowledgements
Modeling
Lukas Widmer has helped us constantly with the modeling and issues with the wiki. We are truly grateful to him for his continuous support and for guiding us throughout the course of the project.
Lab
Sabine Oesterle and Bartolomeo Angelici, our two main advisors for the lab have played a significant role throughout the project, right from helping us with the materials to resolving some key issues we faced during the project. We would like to thank them for their valuable insights and constant support.
3D-Printing & PDMS Chip
Mario Mauerer shared his knowledge and time to teach us some important concepts in 3D-printing. Thanks to him we were able to design our millifluidic devices.
Gregor Schmidt and Arne Wehling helped us with PDMS preparation and shared their knowledge on microfluidic chip design.
Flow cytometry
Verena Jäggin helped us with the set up and usage of flow cytometry. With her assistance we were able to analyse the expression of recombinase TP901 in detail.
pPaB plasmids
Andreas Bosshart provided all the pPaB plasmids which we used as backbone for our constructs and he was always there to help us when we ran into issues. We are very grateful to him for that.
Gibson assembly
Dr. Tania Roberts taught us how to perform Gibson assembly. Apart from providing us with the materials and protocols, she also helped us by proofreading our abstract. We are truly grateful to her.
Alginate beads
Steven Schmitt showed us how to produce alginate beads. He advised us in our project and let us use his materials and protocols. We are very grateful for his patience and generosity.
Last minute competent cells
Ali Yasin Sonay kindly provided us with special competent cells when we desperately needed them shortly before the parts submission deadline.
Riboregulators
James Collins and Jarred Callura really quickly and kindly replied to our emails with questions about the riboregulators they presented in the paper Genetic switchboard for synthetic biology applications, PNAS, 2012 .
Safety
Thanks to Niels Bürckert for emphasising the importance of safety and for the helpful discussions concerning the safety form.
Interviews
Thanks to all the experts who accepted to be interviewed for our Human Practice project. They helped us broaden our perspective on complexity.
General
We would like to thank all those who gave us useful feedbacks at our beer talk event. Last but not the least we would like to thank everyone who filled out our survey.
We thank our sponsors:

Team Introduction
2014 OUC-China is made up of 15 students from Ocean University of China. Our members are from different colleges, majoring in biology, biochemistry, ecology etc. Our team got together, trying to figure out what we could do with synthetic biology. At the beginning of our project, we were all unfamiliar with other members and subjects, and were not sure of what would happen. But we encouraged each other, worked together, and finally overcame difficulties. At the end of this project, we were so proud of the effort we made during the process, and grateful for everyone's work. Now, iGEM is a family to us all.
We appreciate all our instructors and advisors who have assisted us throughout the project. We also appreciate all the others who provided valuable advice and essential materials for the project. If it were not for their help, the project would not have been so successful.

Lab
Our OUC-iGEM Lab is attached to the Experimental Teaching Center of Marine Life Sciences, Ocean University of China. Our lab was established by Association of Science and Technology (OAST) in September, 2011. Our center has long endeavored to do researches in Marine Microbial Ecology, Marine Aquaculture Diseases, Marine Beneficial Microorganism, and eta. The main purpose of this lab is to support iGEM experiment. Considering that synthetic biology is a new branch of biology, our lab is directly managed by the iGEM members. The experimental apparatus gathers from many other labs of our center. Now our lab have become an ""Open platform"" for every student who want and enable to do independently designed experiments. Our lab has now established a thorough management system running by a 10 people committee.

Attributions; what the Aberdeen iGEM team members did
Alpha Team – Ag43 Protein
Team Members: Ana Maria Cujba and Martyna Sroka carried out the following work;
Alpha team took an Ag43 part produced by the 2012 Hokkaido University iGEM team, the goal at first appeared simple – insert a FLAG-tag-multiple-cloning-site (FLAG+MCS) into Ag43.  However, two further problems had to be overcome first:  1. The part had six additional Pst1 sites (non-compliant with RFC-10) which did not appear in the registry sequence. These sites had to be removed.  2. Ag43 has beta hairpins, these are somewhat like Velcro and stick the cells together so that can form biofilms, for our assay these would lead to false-positives and two of them had to be removed. Only after solving those two problems, alpha team proceeded to insert FLAG+MCS; they also experimentally characterized all Ag43-related parts.
Omega Team – INP
Team Members: James Long and Joseph MacKinnon carried out the following work;
Omega team took an INP part produced by the 2011 Edinburgh University iGEM team, (this part is simply INP with engineered yellow fluorescent protein (eYFP) attached to the C-terminus).  A FLAG(and HexaHis ""His"")-MCS had to be inserted onto the C-terminus of eYFP, although this is simple in theory it still took longer than expected, not only due to PCRs misbehaving, but more importantly the antibody test was negative and it was suspected that the eYFP (having its C and N termini on the same side) was shielding the FLAG/His tag.  Because of this, the eYFP had to be removed and the FLAG tag attached to the C-terminus of INP.
Modelling and GFP Detector
Team Member: Konstantin Gizdov carried out the following work;
Mathematical modelling proved to be extremely useful to the team, it flagged up that an ELISA assay would probably not work, and as such when this gave poor results it was immediately abandoned in favour of a magnetic pull-down assay.  It was also able to predict what the optimum ratio of “sender” to “receiver” cultures would be to give the best signal-to-noise ratio.  As the ultimate goal of our project was to deploy a HAT detection kit in Africa, a cheap GFP detector would be needed, the only ones on the market are highly precise and expensive.  A working DIY detector was created from off-the-shelf parts that cost less than £100 total and could be powered by a cheap solar-cell.
Parts and Quorum Testing
Team Member: James McAvoy carried out the following work;
This task can be split into three components.  1. Testing the individual expression of FLAG by Ag43 and INP use of anti-FLAG antibodies and fluorescence microscopy to see whether the plasmids worked.  2. Producing the composite cells (with Ag43 or INP plasmid, sender or receiver plasmid, and RFP identification plasmid all in the same cell).  3. Quorum-testing was a data-intensive task, these two cell cultures were tested with anti-GFP and anti-FLAG antibodies.  At first ELISA-type assays were used to achieve this but these produced very poor results and were upgraded to a magnetic bead pull-down assay which were much better and gave us a proof-of-concept.
All submitted BioBrick parts were designed and created by our team:
• Bba_K1352000 (Martyna Sroka, Ana-Maria Cujba)
• Bba_K1352001 (Martyna Sroka, Ana-Maria Cujba)
• Bba_K1352002 (Martyna Sroka, Ana-Maria Cujba)
• Bba_K1352004 (Jamie Long, Joseph MacKinnon)
• Bba_K1352006 (Jamie Long, Joseph MacKinnon)
All parts characterisation experiments were performed by the members of our team:
• Bba_K759001 (Martyna Sroka, Ana-Maria Cujba)
• Bba_K542009 (Martyna Sroka, Ana-Maria Cujba)
• Bba_K346007 (Martyna Sroka, Ana-Maria Cujba)
• Bba_K1090000 (James McAvoy)
• Bba_T9002 (James McAvoy)
The GFP detector was designed and built by Konstantin Gizdov.

Ana-Maria Cujba
Hi, I am Ana and I come from Transylvania (Romania), which you might now from the movies as Dracula’s home (creepy, right?). Since moving to Aberdeen to        study Biochemistry with Immunology, I came across a lot of unexpected opportunities. In that sense, iGEM has been both a really intense and new experience:        great fun, brilliant instructors and tons of exciting experiments. As part of the team, I do a lot of wet lab-work (it relaxes me, as geeky as it sounds), I        am in charge of parts description and currently work on Antigen 43 (autotransporter protein) as a platform to express peptides on the cell surface of E.coli. I love being creative and coming up with new ideas. I am one of the optimistic members of the team and awkwardly enough, the one who will always get easily        excited (honestly, like a kid!) when experiments work as planned. I love Spanish culture, latino dances, travelling and teaching kids. If you don’t find me        in the lab, I might be on the dance floor!
Konstantin Gizdov
Hi! I’m a third year Physics student at University of Aberdeen. I’m originally from a small town in Bulgaria, where my grandfather got me excited about        technology and engineering. I came to Aberdeen in search for a chance to meet and collaborate with people at the frontiers of science. So then, you can        imagine how I excited I was when I got offered to take part in the uni’s iGEM team and work on a cutting edge science project. So far it’s been amazing        working with everyone and trying our best at the world’s biggest problems. As per my experience with mathematics, problem solving and computers, I am mainly        involved in modelling and simulating our system in order to optimize the design and make it function as we want. Parallel to this, I’m building an optical        fluorescent detector to conceptualize our disease testing method. I’m also involved with the design of our Wiki and take part in the public outreach. When        I’m free from my duties, I like to travel, take pictures and ride my bike.
James Long
Hello, I’m Jamie and an undergrad student of Immunology studying at the University of Aberdeen. Originally from Sandwich Kent, I moved to Edinburgh, Scotland        when I was young. In my spare time I like building and playing with bikes and computers. I am fortunate that I was offered the opportunity to take part in        iGEM with my uni, and glad that I seized it. I turned down a paid summer placement in the U.S. for iGEM, but have no regrets about doing so. iGEM is much        more fun and interesting than I was expecting.  My role on this project was (with Joseph) to take the BioBrick produced by the iGEM Edinburgh team in 2011        and insert a FLAG/His Tag inside a multiple-cloning-site, onto the end of YFP. This would allow future teams to easily insert a gene for a protein which the        cell would then surface express.
James McAvoy
Hi I’m James, originally from Hertfordshire near Cambridge. I have a BSc in Pharmacology from Portsmouth University. I am now entering Honours for a second        BSc in Biotechnology (Applied Molecular Biology).
I am involved in the designing and testing of the quorum sensing system, for this I need to know about how cells can communicate with molecules, signal        transduction and its resulting impact on gene expression. I have a keen interest in experimental design, developing novel ways for finding out information        for the team they wouldn’t otherwise be able to know. For instance how can you simulate how binding of cells to a target will determine their relative        distances and resulting signal output? I try to see the bigger picture and guide the team towards its end goal of a viable diagnostic system.
In my spare time I read science fiction and philosophy while blasting ‘Crystal Castles’.
Joseph Mackinnon
I’m a third year undergraduate in microbiology. I am the ‘local person’ on the team as I have lived near Aberdeen for most of my life. I joined the team as I        realised how unique an opportunity participating in iGEM is. The role I have been fulfilling in the team is one of the lead human practices contacts, and        working on the modification of Ice Nucleation Protein. As well as being interested in microbiology I also enjoy spending time outdoors and have spent some        time working for Outward Bound in South Africa. In the future I hope to find a way to combine these interests in some way.
Martyna Sroka
Hey! My name is Martyna and I study Biomedical Sciences specializing in Molecular Biology at the University of Aberdeen. Although I started off with        Medicine, I soon discovered that it is the science behind medicine that fascinates me the most. Although my main field of interest is cancer and stem cells,        I decided to participate in iGEM as I like the interdisciplinary aspect of the competition. I think synthetic biology is a very interesting field which in        the future may answer a lot of questions we struggle with nowadays. Plus hey, what's better than spending your holidays in the lab! ;) My role in the team        was to engineer Ag43 autotransporter in order to allow easy insertion of foreign peptide sequences for expression on the cell surface of E.coli. I also took        active part in organizing public outreach activities. In my free time, I enjoy aggressive roller-skating, rock music and long walks with my German shepherd.        I am looking forward to meeting everyone at the Gigant Jamboree at MIT!​

iGEM Team attributions page
Each team must clearly attribute work done by the student team members on this page.  The team must distinguish work done by the students from work done by others, including the host labs, advisors, instructors, and individuals not on the team roster.
Why do we have this requirement?
Attribution Template
We have this requirement to help the judges know what you did yourselves and what you had help with. We don't mind if you get help with difficult or complex techniques, just be sure to report the work your team did and the work that was done by others.
For example, you might choose to work with an animal model during your project. Working with animals requires getting a license and applying far in advance to conduct certain experiments in many countries. This is something that is difficult to achieve during the course of a summer, but much easier if you can work with a postdoc or PI who has the right licenses.
A great example of complete attribution comes from the Imperial College London 2011 team (scroll down to the bottom of their team page to see attributions).
Here are some of the fields we recommend you have on this page. If there are other areas not listed below, but applicable to your team/project, please feel free to also list them on your attributions page. Please feel free to remove any areas not applicable to your project.

Chiara Asselborn
I am the biomedical sciences student of the group, starting my senior year in physiology in September. The thing I like most about iGEM is its multidisciplinary approach. I am hoping that I will learn to incorporate new ways of tackling set projects by learning from my peers.
I teamed up with Elize and Sam to think about the human practices side of the project, but I am also helping out with lab work. Especially by tidying, cleaning and labelling everything that comes my way in the lab.

Sam Ireland
I’m a Biology student, specialising in Biotechnology in my final year next year. I’ve been keen to do iGEM since it came up in a lecture in First Year, since it struck me as something that will probably be ‘big’ in the 21st century.
My interests within the team are in the communication of our project. I like explaining concepts, and hopefully I can make some contributions to that aspect of our project. I also have an interest in the modelling side of things, but unfortunately in this case my interest far outstrips my skills so I’ll just be a curious onlooker as far as modelling in this project goes.
Charlotte Lilley
I’m a third year Biotechnology student, with an interest in microbiology and genetics  I joined iGEM because it seemed like the best way to get experience of performing a science project, and and an interesting way to spend a summer. I’m working on allowing bacteria to communicate using sugars.
Elize Petrovska
I'm the Civil Engineer for the team. I chose to do iGEM because the whole idea of engineering living organisms blows my mind a little bit, and I thought it would be interesting to see what is going on in a branch of engineering that is so completely different from the one I'm studying.
Over the summer, I will be looking into Human Practices aspects of our project and Synthetic Biology in general, and exploring the connection of these to other branches of science, technology and, well, life. I will also give my best try to help the Computer Modelling team in producing pretty MATLAB graphs, but we'll see how that goes.

Carrie Pickering
Hi, I am Carrie Pickering. I am a 23 year old student at Edinburgh. I am in my second year studying Biology, with an aim of doing my honours in Biochemistry. Before I came to university I was an engineer in the Royal Navy, so iGEM sounded like a good opportunity to mix my engineering background with my current biology studies. In my spare time I am a keen diver and enjoy reading and travelling.
Cesar Pumar-Garcia
I am an MSc student, specialising in Artificial Intelligence, holding a BSc in Informatics Engineering. I deal with computer modelling, both ODEs and agent-based models.
I heard about Synthetic Biology during the first year of my BSc, so I learnt basic biology by myself and did an BSc project consisting in agent-based models of synthetic bacteria and bacteriophages.
My dissertation is in the context of Machine Learning based Automatic Design for Synthetic Biology, so my plan is to find how to apply it to our ODEs models at some point.
Yuma Shino
I first heard of iGEM when I was 16 back in 2009 at a Young Biochemistry Researchers convention. The idea of University teams competing with each other creating genetically modified organisms intrigued me and I participated in a mini-iGEM brainstorming activity as well. 5 years later I am in my 3rd going on to 4th year of my Biotechnology course and joined the iGEM team in order to experience for myself what the iGEM was really like. The process of working together with others for creating and processing ideas is both interesting and enlightening as well as deeply fulfilling.
Anna Stikāne
I am going into my final year of undergraduate biology, with Honours in Biotechnology. Over the years I have met many wonderful people with various scientific, musical, literary and adventure-hunting interests. This experience has convinced me to say big ‘YES’ to big opportunities such as iGEM. To me, iGEM brings together a chance to do some great biology and a challenge to sharpen my teamwork and communication skills and explore the endless possibilities of collaboration between scientists, engineers and artists. Exciting!
In this project I keep cultivating my love for bacteria by working with such bright and shiny biological objects as GFP and RFP.

Acknowledgements
Sponsors
We would first and foremost like to thank all of our sponsors for their generous contributions, which enabled and sustained our project. None of this would have been possible without the following companies and organisations:
Assistance
We are also indebted to all of our supervisors - Dr. Jon Marles-Wright, Dr. Louise Horsfall, Dr. Chris French, Dr. Patrick Cai, Dr. Baojun Wang and Dr. Alistair Elfick - as well as our instructors.
Anna would like to thank David S. Radford , Maryia Trubitsyna and Nick Pantidos for their help with all kinds of lab work,  Alejandro Salinas for help with primer design and scripting for the transfer of data from excel (co-written by her brother Krisjanis Kokoritis), Elvis Bernard for his help with the plate reader, and also Joseph White, all invaluable for carrying out the degron sub-project.
Sam and Philip are grateful for the help offered by Dr. Garry Blakely, Dr. Andrew Free and Dr. Sam Brown - not affiliated with the iGEM team but who nevertheless gave up some of their time to help with the planning of the population regulation sub-project.
Yuma would like to thank Dr. Joseph White and Dr. Chaokuo Liu of French labs, for their help in the design of the PEA knockout cassette, and for providing cells transformed with lambda red.
Charlotte would like to give thanks to Dr. Chaokuo Liu also for providing the initial xylanase construct, and also to Dave Radford and Maryia Trubitsyna for their tireless help with the primer design and ordering.
Carrie is particularly grateful to Louise Horsfall for getting her constructs synthesised after many stubbornly failed PCRs.
Dr. Jane Calvert, Dr. Emma Frow, and Dr. Pablo Schyfterf from the School of Social and Political Science were very helpful for Elize and Chiara for listening to and providing feedback on our human practices project.
Dr. Sam Brown provided valuable insights to Cesar in the development of the population control model.
We'd also like to give a general 'cheers!' to our labmates in the Chris French lab for putting up with, to our supervisors for picking us, and of course to the MIT team for offering to host us after the jamboree is over - cheers!

Rikki Guy
I am a student of Informatics (aka Computer Science), with a particular interest in expanding the borders of software development and use. Cue iGEM! I first discovered Synthetic Biology and iGEM last year, via the University's Synthetic Biology Society, and thought it sounded like an amazing thing to do, and something different than the usual old tech internship. My main focus was on developing software tools to help the rest of the team's efforts, resulting in two useable pieces of software.
Sam Ireland

I am yet another biologist in the team, currently doing my specialisation in applied microbiology. I have  been interested in iGEM since the first  time I ever heard of it, back in first year. I am thrilled to be part of the Edinburh  iGEM team this year, and I'm really looking forward to  the giant Jamboree. My scientific interests lie  in discovering the natural interactions between microorganisms in the environment, for the purposes of industrial biotechnology. At my free time I enjoy transcribing music and meeting with friends.

iGEM Team attributions page
Each team must clearly attribute work done by the student team members on this page.  The team must distinguish work done by the students from work done by others, including the host labs, advisors, instructors, and individuals not on the team roster.
Why do we have this requirement?
Attribution Template
We have this requirement to help the judges know what you did yourselves and what you had help with. We don't mind if you get help with difficult or complex techniques, just be sure to report the work your team did and the work that was done by others.
For example, you might choose to work with an animal model during your project. Working with animals requires getting a license and applying far in advance to conduct certain experiments in many countries. This is something that is difficult to achieve during the course of a summer, but much easier if you can work with a postdoc or PI who has the right licenses.
A great example of complete attribution comes from the Imperial College London 2011 team (scroll down to the bottom of their team page to see attributions).
Here are some of the fields we recommend you have on this page. If there are other areas not listed below, but applicable to your team/project, please feel free to also list them on your attributions page. Please feel free to remove any areas not applicable to your project.
General Support
Project support and advice
Fundraising help and advice
Lab support
Difficult technique support
Project advisor support
Wiki support
Presentation coaching
Policy & Practices support
Thanks and acknowledgements for all other people involved in helping make a successful iGEM team.

Attributions and Thanks
While the project was most certainly a team effort, it is also important to acknowledge the individuals in the team.  Here's a breakdown of what we all got up to.
Undergraduate Students
Wet Lab
Amy Ferguson:Created, along with Lydia, the “Wilkins” mascot for the team. Documented the project in notebooks, including the weekly report, plasmids page etc. Worked extensively on the Gas Vesicle Proteins. Made GvpA/GvpC constructs with various different promoters and testing their ability to float.  Made the J23100/GFP and did a comparison of the efficiency of the various fluorescent things.
Jake Casson: Social media guru, informing the world of our cake-based exploits via Twitter.
Designed the switch (and many other oligos), and also made the integrase Biobrick.
Martin Campbell: Modified the low copy number vector (psc101) by extracting unneeded stuff and replaced with an iGEM MCS, then ligated in RFP/GFP switch. Transformed the switch and our integrase and performed in vivo switching.
Designed lots of oligos.
Beth Greig: Did a lot of work on the human practices side of things, and produced the majority of the material for the human practices page, as well as doing a lot of Biobrick documenting for the registry.
Jacob Roberts: Optimised and tested the fliC biobrick. Master of competent cells.
Gemma McLelland: Optimised and tested the fliC biobrick.
Gintarė Sendžikaitė:Developed motility assay and worked with motA and motB motility genes and gene rescue.
Lydia Alldred:Created, along with Amy, the “Wilkins” mascot for the team, and drew him in the various poses (poster comic strip, logo etc). Carried out the in vitro site-specific recombination assays to test switch operation
Dry Lab
Aimee Bias: Modelling, measurements and wiki page. Also the main compiler of the risk assessments, both for the wet and dry lab and our science centre stalls.
Robbie Evans: Modelling, measurements and wiki page.
Supervisors and additional support
Of course, we cannot take all the credit!  A massive thank you to all our advisors, sponsors, and supporters. Without these guys, we would have been totally lost. No, really.
Main Project Supervisors
Dr Sean Colloms ( primary supervisor and instructor): Lecturer in Synthetic Biology (Institute of Molecular Cell and Systems Biology): Our main day to day supervisor, helping us with all aspects of the project - including lab procedures, oligo designing. The ""go-to-guy"" for everything synthetic biology.
Professor Marshall Stark (official instructor):Professor of Molecular Genetics (Institute of Molecular Cell and Systems Biology): His role was very similar to Sean's.
Dr Julien Reboud (official instructor):  Lord Kelvin Adam Smith Fellow in Synthetic Biology (Biomedical Engineering).
His assistance and experience in synthetic biology was particularly invaluable to the biomedical engineers, to help shape their modelling and measurement system.
Lab and Techniques Support
Ms Emma Smith (official instructor): One of our lab supervisors, she offered assistance as we were learning new lab techniques.
Ms Abioye Jumai Adeola(team member): Both a supervisor and team member, worked with Gintare on motility genes.
Ms Jia Zhao (Offical Advisor): Supplied integrase plasmids and expertise.
Dr Femi Olorunniji: Supplied purified PhiC31 integrase protein and reaction buffer.
Project Planning/Development Support
Dr Joseph Gray: Associate Academic (Institute of Molecular Cell and Systems Biology).  Was present at many of the inital meetings, and helped to shape the plan of the project.
Modelling and Measurement Support
Mr Saikat Jana: Provided guidance on the reporting and quantification of the engineer's findings, and also helped with some MATLAB coding for said quantification.
Wiki Support
Miss Nadia Colloms: On a number of occasions, offered her knowledge of HTML/CSS to the less experienced engineers, and helped give the final result a bit more polish.
Human Practices Support
Dr John Walls: Research Associate (School of Interdisciplinary Studies).
With his extensive experience in the ethical considerations of research, he helped us plan out our human practices approach while teaching us the appropriate terminology.
Mr Jamie Gallagher:  Our primary contact for the science centre events. Always happy to help, and super quick in replying to emails!
Glasgow Science Centre staff and Patrons:  A huge thanks goes to the helpful and accommodating staff, whose organisational skills ensured smooth running events.
And thank you also to all those who stopped to chat with us at our stall/play with the bubbles: your input was most greatly appreciated.
All the researchers who answered our human practices emails - thank you!
Dr Tim Overton‏ (Birmingham University‏)
Professor Catherine Biggs‏ (University of Sheffield‏)
Professor Steve Busby‏ (Birmingham University‏)
Professor David Barrie Johnson(Bangor University).
Catherine J. Gandy, Jaime M. Amezaga (Newcastle University)
General Support
A huge thank you to all the other iGEM teams we met, at the Sulsa conference/iGEM meet up and the London meet up.  It was great to get to know some of you, and share our ideas.
Dr Annegret Honsbein: Postdoctoral Research Assistant (Institute of Molecular Cell and Systems Biology). Took the time to come and give the team a talk on her research, and gave us many ideas for the future of the project.
Mr Kevin Dorman: for taking some of the team pictures (and on his lunch break too!)
All the staff in the Bower Building
The Wolfson Medical Building: for providing the caffeine addicts among us with our daily fix.
Sponsors
And of course, a huge thank you to all our kind sponsors.  May we extend further thanks to Susla, who kindly invited us to, and organised, the first Scottish iGEM meetup/Sulsa Synthetic Biology Conference.
Sulsa -- Wellcome Trust -- Biochemical Society -- MSD -- BBSRC -- Society for General Microbiology -- Life Technologies

The Team
Hello from Bonnie Scotland! We are the Glasgow University iGEM team: a group of ragtag superheroes from both the School of Life Sciences and the School of Engineering.  Our official iGEM profile can be found here (opens in a new window).
Students
The main body of the team is composed of 10 undergraduate (4th year) students, mainly studying genetics, but with a plant scientist and two biomedical engineers as well.
Mouse over to learn our origins! (this might take a while to load - sorry!)
The wet lab:
Lydia Alldred (Genetics)
Martin Campbell (Genetics)
Jake Casson (Molecular and Cellular Biology with Plant Science).
Amy Ferguson (Genetics)
Beth Greig (Genetics)
Gemma McLelland (Genetics)
Jacob Roberts (Genetics)
Gintarė Sendžikaitė (Genetics)
The dry lab
Aimee Bias (Biomedical Engineering)
Robbie Evans (Biomedical Engineering)
Supervisors
Dr Sean Colloms
While not walking in the Scottish Highlands and shoulder crunching at prehistoric stone circles, Sean likes to tie knots in DNA and dream up new applications for DNA transposition and site-specific recombination.
Professor Marshall Stark
Marshall's main research interest is site-specific recombination. He also has an impressive collection of amusing facts and anecdotes, which were excellent at distracting us from important lab work.
Dr Julien Reboud
Julien's current research interests have a focus on integrating biology and engineering for the benefits of healthcare and industry. Two of his focuses are Acoustofluidics (for sample manipulation), and of course, synthetic biology.
Jumai Abioye
Jumai recently graduated from the MSc Biotechnology programme at the University of Glasgow and she is currently working towards her PhD in Biomedical Engineering in the same University.
Zhao Jia
Jia is a PhD student at the University of Glasgow. Her research interest is constructing novel genetic circuits to enable cells to perform useful functions. She hopes these designs will be used in the future cellular computers.
Emma Smith
In between attending young researchers socials to indulge on free wine and crisps, Emma can be found working towards her PhD at the University of Glasgow.  In the future, she hopes to be in a dark corner of the lab editing genomes.
Wilkins
Wilkins is the name of our summer laboratory, and also our Team Mascot!  He's a not-so-lean, definitely not mean - but he is kinda green - badness fighting machine.  We've documented his origin story and super hero exploits in our comic: The Story of Wilkins!
He gained his rather fetching traffic cone hat after joining us for the summer - when in Glasgow, do as the Glaswegians do!

Each team must clearly attribute work done by the student team members on this page.  The team must distinguish work done by the students from work done by others, including the host labs, advisors, instructors, and individuals not on the team roster.
Why do we have this requirement?
Attribution Template
We have this requirement to help the judges know what you did yourselves and what you had help with. We don't mind if you get help with difficult or complex techniques, just be sure to report the work your team did and the work that was done by others.
For example, you might choose to work with an animal model during your project. Working with animals requires getting a license and applying far in advance to conduct certain experiments in many countries. This is something that is difficult to achieve during the course of a summer, but much easier if you can work with a postdoc or PI who has the right licenses.
A great example of complete attribution comes from the Imperial College London 2011 team (scroll down to the bottom of their team page to see attributions).
Here are some of the fields we recommend you have on this page. If there are other areas not listed below, but applicable to your team/project, please feel free to also list them on your attributions page. Please feel free to remove any areas not applicable to your project.
General Support
Project support and advice
Fundraising help and advice

The Arizona State University iGEM team
 
The Arizona State University iGEM team has taken on a project of creating biodiesel in a new and efficient way using Escherichia coli. Using a wax esterase, fatty acids and ethanol, which are both naturally produced by E. coli, can be combined to form biodiesel. However, E. coli uses the same intermediate products to produce both fatty acids and ethanol, which reduces the efficiency of this process. This problem can be avoided by engineering two different strains of E. coli to work in tandem. One strain will be focused on producing free fatty acids (FFA) through increased production of enzymes such as TesA and acc. The other strain will be focused on producing ethanol through the increased production of enzymes such as pdc and adhB. These two products can be combined in one of the two cells using a waxy esterase, producing the final biodiesel product. This form of cooperative production will hopefully produce more ethanol than current single strain methods using E. coli.

Everyone's effort should be honored and repect.
No one work alone as a team. One of the iGEM's charm is to work as a team, to move as a team, to exprience the joy and saddness as a team.Therefore,we grow up from this experience and start to understand the meaning of cooperation in a science study. With this chance to present in our wiki, we shall give our best thanks to who helps us，who teaches us, but also most importantly who always stands just besides us.

Abstract
Navigation Instructions
Sponsors
Cystic Fibrosis is a genetic disease that results in the accumulation of thick mucus in the epithelial linings of the entire body, particularly the respiratory tract. Over the course of a patient’s life, the mucus-lined lung epithelium becomes repeatedly infected with pathogenic bacteria that stimulate an immune response; leading to inflammation, tissue damage, and ultimately, respiratory failure.
The microflora of the Cystic Fibrosis lung changes over time. In childhood, the major coloniser is Staphylococcus aureus, but as the patient matures other bacterial pathogens infect. The later-dominating pathogens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Burkholderia cepacia, are very difficult to eradicate and are associated with chronic decline in lung function. Burkholderia is so infectious that patients have to be isolated from one another, and can be denied lung transplants due to the persistence of this bacterium.
It is important, therefore, for medics to monitor and identify the levels of bacteria within the respiratory tract of a Cystic Fibrosis patient. Currently, patients must provide sputum samples and identification of bacteria takes between 72 hours and 2 weeks, by which point the bacteria can be in an antibiotic resistant state.
The Dundee 2014 iGEM project is focused on designing and testing a device that will rapidly and non-invasively identify the bacteria colonising a Cystic Fibrosis patient. Three biosensors will be developed that recognise external signal molecules produced by key bacteria, all of which are known to be in sputum samples of Cystic Fibrosis patients. A quinolone signal (PQS) is produced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a Diffusible Signal Factor (DSF) is produced by Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, an organism that is also associated with Cystic Fibrosis lung infection in adults, and BDSF is a related, but chemically distinct molecule that is produced by Burkholderia cepacia.
By engineering signal recognition and signal transduction proteins from these biological systems the Dundee iGEM team want to produce a portable electronic device that will identify infection outside of the clinic, so that patients do not have to travel great distances, and can be used to help health professionals make informed and rapid decisions on antibiotic treatments.

Roll Call...
Students
Hover over the images to see another side to the person!
Aleks Płochocka
Nickname: Toothy MaGee
Described in 5: Enthusiastic. Determined. Kind-hearted. Funny. Young’un.
Aleks has a massive love for all things maths and physics. She puts everything she has in to the modelling and building the device, making her a multitasking genius! Aleks is great to be in the lab with as she is always so positive and upbeat about everything (even when it feels like nothing is working!).
Fatima Ulhuq
Nickname: Miss Chief
Described in 5: Resourceful. Creative. Loyal. Inspiring. Passionate
She is a talented Pharmacology Student who has just finished her final year. Not only great at cloning she is great at making smiles. From putting teammates faces on a range of images, with humorous results, to making witty comments that lighten the most stressful of days. A strong pillar of the group and the project could not be a success without her.
Robyn Shuttleworth
Nickname: Sharp Shootin’ Shotgun Shuttleworth
Described in 5: Knowledgeable. Caring. Motivated. Enthusiastic. Spirited.
A Raffish Bounty Hunter who teams with Gillian and Aleks to find the bacterial bandits binding behaviours in efforts to collect The Lung Ranger reward. Her aim and precision is widely acknowledged across the southern plains and her trusty companion Rou ensures she’s the fastest cowboy in the west. When she’s not out on the plains bounty huntin’, her propensity with numbers means she’s statistically the most likely to get a royal flush playing poker.
Dave Burrell
Nickname: Scarlet
Described in 5: Easy-going. Witty. Honest. Ambitious. Inspirational.
Dave is probably one of the most chilled out people in the lab.Studying Computer Science; he’s the master of coding. With everything he does there’s the attitude of “when stuff will work”, not “if”. Aside from being the wiz behind the wiki he worked on the LASSO and dived into electronics with huge enthusiasm. Overall one of the best things about working on a team with Dave is the encouragement he gives you. He’s always motivating in terms of new ideas that come up and always there to crack a joke with, in between.
Gillian Forsyth
Nickname: Frisbeest
Described in 5: Calm. Composed. Full of energy.
Gillian is our team Mathematical Biologist. While trying to come up with stochastic models, she’s making the perplexed biologists relive their nightmare of doing math! Usually, she’s quite calm and composed, until she finds a mini bicycle, and then she’s off! The rest of us might have all moved into the shade, injured by their burns, but Gillian will still be out and having fun! She loves variety in her life so to mix it up; she likes to hop on a space hopper!
Dimitrios Michailidis
Nickname: Conchita Wurst
Described in 5: Bewhiskered Bionic Beauty Battles BioBricks
Science will never defeat him, it may knock him once...twice...three times (while growing competent cells by the gallon full) but never will he surrender.He strives to do his very best, like no one ever has. To Biobrick the genes is his real test, to sequence them is his cause. He will travel across the labs, searching far and wide, each PostDoc to understand, the knowledge that’s inside. Gotta Biobrick them all. His life’s ambition is to be as successful as this year’s Eurovision song contest winner Conchita Wurst...do you think he has the potential?
Roddy McNeill
Nickname: Violet
Described in 5: A buffalo in a blizzard
Hailing from Glasgow's own Wild West end, Roddy brings a most necessary element of calm to the team - cool and collected in the face of results that might frazzle a softer scientist. Roddy has become our resident biochemist, absorbing the techniques of PhD students and PIs alike to become a one-gunned, sharp-eyed, no-horse-having, western-blotting hurricane. Roddy's extra mural activities also strengthen the team - his karate-honed reflexes mean he never drops the lunchtime frisbee and his time spent moonlighting as the lovely Violet has honed a thinly veiled talent for sass, which keeps the rest of us on our toes.
Jen Wood
Nickname: JeMCherry
Described in 5: Merry. Ambitious. Out-going. Energetic. Bubbly.
Jen is the cheery-cherry of the group. Aside from sharing her singing with us in the lab, her passion for running has somehow rubbed off and even the un-fittest amongst us are running to raise money for the CF trust. Jen is our outreach goddess; she is very well connected and her enthusiasm and positivity is very infectious. Watch out our future medic will treat you with happiness and fantastic lemon cake!
Jess Martyn
Nickname: Mr Chief
Described in 5: Grrrrreat Crrrrrackin Passionate Crazy Scientist
""We’ll sneak in after she's left the lab and set everything up for her birthday!"" . . . around about midnight Fatima and Aleks managed to get into the lab to set everything up. Jess is typically the first in, and last out of the lab; diligently pursuing the fluorescent read out from our little Lung Ranger. Bubbly, cheerful and always ready to play a prank (or two!) on unsuspecting members of the team, Jess is a stalwart of the wet lab. Everything she's involved in can generally be summed up as Crackin'!
Advisors
Scott McCrimmon
Scott is a born synthetic biologist, and was in the lab the day after exams planning a cloning strategy. His long standing battle of attrition with colony PCRs has been costly, threatening to grind him down during long afternoons and evenings, and resorting to him pipetting with two Gilsons at a time. Yet his diligence and endurance has paid off, providing us with perfect clones for our devices. Scott’s sunny optimism often bolsters the team; during dark times, with no bands on gels, blank sequence results and no code on the computer, his “F*@k it; it’ll work” always lightens the mood and spurs people on! Scott’s musical expertise is undeniable; his highly anticipated iGEM mashup “Build Me Up Biobrick-All You Need is One (Resistant Colony)-Centrifuges Spin Me Right Round” is sure to make the headlines by the time Boston comes around.As one of the first in the team to present at the SULSA conference, and happy to ferry furniture to different offices when required, no job is too big or too small for Mr McCrimmon.
François Cléon
Like France, but with more ""WAH”
François is very enthusiastic and passionate about science. He is always cool and collected in the lab; as well as on the football field!
Karim Rafie
Karim has a talent for asking the questions which you haven’t even considered! He keeps us on our toes and helps us overcome any issues. With his help we are able to better understand our work and in turn progress with our project. Always popping his head in to see if there is anything he can help us with.
Avril Smart
Avril is an iGEM veteran at the University of Dundee, having been a member of the 2012 team and stepping into an advisory role for the 2013 and 2014 teams.  Being a bit of a renaissance woman, Avril has helped us all out not only by contributing to our project-planning meetings at the start of the summer and helping to lay the groundwork in the lab, but also by creating some beautiful artwork for our wiki (including The Lung Ranger himself!). Not content with countless hours of brushstrokes, she has also been working on a wee musical iGEM treat…
Supervisors
Prof Tracy Palmer
Tracy “Cactus ” Palmer is making her debut to the Jamboree this year after heading up the Dundee iGEM competition at home since 2011. Cactus Palmer is one of the most notorious outlaws of the Wild West, keeping her band of lawless students in check and making sure we don't stray from the path by running an 8mm gel for anything longer than 3 minutes... Tracy's famous skill at the cloning bench (it's a black art!) is envied by us all and we've spent the summer trying to develop our own magic hands. Although Tracy has been known to leave the team shaking in their little cowboy boots, her knowledge and experience is always on hand to settle things down when there's a fox in the iGEM henhouse!
Prof Frank Sargent
Frank “Snakebite” Sargent is an iGEM veteran - with 3 competitions under his belt he returns to Boston this year on the poster judging panel, beware his eagle-eye! This poker-faced protein master has been mentoring the team over the summer by teaching us the way of the wild-western blot (with all the associated book-learnin’), helping us to design experiments to test our system, and by making an appearance as a scar-faced villain in our photoshoot.
Dr Fordyce Davidson
Dyce is the dynamic driving force behind the dry lab. His high expectations of each team member bring out the best in us. Behind his formal attire is a comedian at heart and someone who is always prepared to ply us with coffee in our hours of need!

Welcome to Dundee's 2014 Wiki (Site Information)
Abstract
Navigation Instructions
Sponsors
Cystic Fibrosis is a genetic disease that results in the accumulation of thick mucus in the epithelial linings of the entire body, particularly the respiratory tract. Over the course of a patient’s life, the mucus-lined lung epithelium becomes repeatedly infected with pathogenic bacteria that stimulate an immune response; leading to inflammation, tissue damage, and ultimately, respiratory failure.
The microflora of the Cystic Fibrosis lung changes over time. In childhood, the major coloniser is Staphylococcus aureus, but as the patient matures other bacterial pathogens infect. The later-dominating pathogens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Burkholderia cepacia, are very difficult to eradicate and are associated with chronic decline in lung function. Burkholderia is so infectious that patients have to be isolated from one another, and can be denied lung transplants due to the persistence of this bacterium.
It is important, therefore, for medics to monitor and identify the levels of bacteria within the respiratory tract of a Cystic Fibrosis patient. Currently, patients must provide sputum samples and identification of bacteria takes between 72 hours and 2 weeks, by which point the bacteria can be in an antibiotic resistant state.
The Dundee 2014 iGEM project is focused on designing and testing a device that will rapidly and non-invasively identify the bacteria colonising a Cystic Fibrosis patient. Three biosensors will be developed that recognise external signal molecules produced by key bacteria, all of which are known to be in sputum samples of Cystic Fibrosis patients. A quinolone signal (PQS) is produced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a Diffusible Signal Factor (DSF) is produced by Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, an organism that is also associated with Cystic Fibrosis lung infection in adults, and BDSF is a related, but chemically distinct molecule that is produced by Burkholderia cepacia.
By engineering signal recognition and signal transduction proteins from these biological systems the Dundee iGEM team want to produce a portable electronic device that will identify infection outside of the clinic, so that patients do not have to travel great distances, and can be used to help health professionals make informed and rapid decisions on antibiotic treatments.

iGEM Team attributions page
Each team must clearly attribute work done by the student team members on this page.  The team must distinguish work done by the students from work done by others, including the host labs, advisors, instructors, and individuals not on the team roster.
Why do we have this requirement?
Attribution Template
We have this requirement to help the judges know what you did yourselves and what you had help with. We don't mind if you get help with difficult or complex techniques, just be sure to report the work your team did and the work that was done by others.
For example, you might choose to work with an animal model during your project. Working with animals requires getting a license and applying far in advance to conduct certain experiments in many countries. This is something that is difficult to achieve during the course of a summer, but much easier if you can work with a postdoc or PI who has the right licenses.
A great example of complete attribution comes from the Imperial College London 2011 team (scroll down to the bottom of their team page to see attributions).
Here are some of the fields we recommend you have on this page. If there are other areas not listed below, but applicable to your team/project, please feel free to also list them on your attributions page. Please feel free to remove any areas not applicable to your project.

The Aix-Marseille iGEM Team
Team Members
From left to right and top to bottom :
Alexia, Romain, Vincent, Lambert, Aimeric, Clara
Aimeric Agaoua
Hi, my name is Aimeric and I’m a third year student in cellular biology! I have always been fascinated with Science (Mathematics, Geology, Physics, Biology, …) and even if humans have already discovered every continent on Earth, there are still so many things we don't know about our own world. That’s why I chose to study Biology.
iGEM competition is, for me, an opportunity to learn more about how research happens and to meet people who are studying other scientific fields which are essential for the project. It's also a way to learn about communication, sponsorship and other things that are not biology but a part of scientific research. It's also just fun!
Alexia Satouf
Hi! My name is Alexia. Next year will be my third year of advanced studies in engineering at Polytech Marseille in the Biotechnology section. Biotechnology really interests me because of the technical and industrial aspects it brings to biology.
The iGEM competition is a very interesting opportunity to use my knowledge in Biology but also to learn new techniques. Moreover, this is an incredible human adventure for a student that really deserves to be lived!
Clara Bouyx
My name is Clara and I have been studying Cell Biology for three years. Scientific research in this field is really fascinating because it is closely linked to concrete problems such as cancer, developmental biology… Until now, my formation was mostly aimed at research. As I will enter an engineering school next year, the proposition to participate to iGEM competition appeared interesting. Indeed, it is very educative because you learn how to work in a team, how to find sponsorships, and you improve your laboratory techniques. It’s definitely a great social and professional experience!
Lambert Antoni
My name is Lambert and I have been studying Biology at Aix-Marseille University for three years. At the end of this summer, I will join an engineering school of biotechnology. I’ve decided to participate to iGEM competition in order to improve my skills. Through this adventure, I’m learning teamwork and how to build a scientific project with every aspect it can present: communication, sponsorship, and experiments. I think it’s a great opportunity to investigate fields that are different from Biology. It’s also a very interesting social experience based on solidarity.  I hope it will help to improve my English as well!
Apart from that, I’m keen on music, I play the guitar a lot, and I love meet my friends at the pub!
Romain Veillard
Hi, my name is Romain and I’m studying Computer Science since three years now. My goal in this project is to help the team to document the parts they create or modify. I also have the privilege to present their amazing work on the wiki. Moreover, I don’t know anything about Biology so if I can understand what I’m publishing on the wiki, then… we can suppose that everyone who read our explanations will understand our project.
This iGEM competition is for me an opportunity to improve my skills in web designing and development, but in the mean time to learn how a scientific project is built from scratch. That’s a good experience for my future professional and social life and I really think that everyone should take part to this kind of competition.
Vincent Castel
Hi, my name is Vincent Castel and I am currently in fifth year of Mathematics. I take care in the project of the part about modelling. I have a great interest in the application of Math in Medicine and Biology. I'm going to tell you my story.
Once upon a time, in the country of Aix-Marseille University, three apprentices in apothecary (biology) and a magician (computer scientist) have created a new iGEM guild. This team needed a strategist (mathematician) who could revolutionize their project. They met the Lord of the Map (modeling) in Marseille. After this encounter, the Lord didn’t have the choice, he had to call his best knight, me. When I heard his cry of despair, I instantly responded my desire to help them. They were saved.
Then, it was the beginning of a great story of companionship and fun.
To be continued...
Team Instructors
From left to right :
Laetitia HOUOT, Gaël CHAMBONNIER, Sandra MICHEL, James STURGIS
James Sturgis
Professor of Biochemistry and director of a CNRS laboratory in Marseille, my research centers on using biochemical and biophysical methods to understand membrane protein structure, function and interactions. I recently created a synthetic biology course at the university and so was very keen to help our team turn theory into practice by participating in the iGEM.
Gaël Chambonnier
Hi everyone, after 3 years in the Lyon iGEM teams and a year lost between Lyon and Marseille, I'm back in the game. While in the first year of my PhD in bioinformatics and genomics, I'm very happy to be part of the adventure and to share my excitation for the iGEM competition and Synthetic Biology with this new French iGEM team, Aix-Marseille.
See you guys in Boston, and let's go for a summer full of Sea, Sun and ... Synthetic Biology!!!
Laetitia Houot
When I first heard about the iGEM, I thought it was such a pity this competition didn’t exist when I was an undergrad student, as it is a unique opportunity to have biologists, chemists and computer scientists working together. Now, as an assistant professor in Biochemistry at Aix-Marseille University, I’m excited to be on the “instructor side” of the team. My research interests focus on bacterial adaptation to the environment and on pathogenicity. I hope my experience of bench work will help our team to realize its ambitious project and to develop a durable iGEM spirit in Marseille !!!
Sandra Michel
Hi, I am currently a PhD student in Microbiology and Biotechnology. For me, iGEM competition is a way to discover Synthetic Biology and its potential. It is also a way to share and transmit my knowledge and my experience on the bench. It allows me to discover a new project, a new organism, new techniques and the existence of BioBrick™ standards. This could I think, within the limits of the possible, greatly facilitate the scientific community. The iGEM is, for me, as much a human experience as a scientific one and I am happy, this year, to be part of it with the team of Aix-Marseille.

Special thanks
We would like to thank our supervisors, whose expertise in TA systems was the origin of the idea of Mighty Coli. A special thanks to Thibaut Hallaert and Baptiste Dumont, who had the exceptional patience to stand our inexperience, and could witness with us the impossible results we often obtained. Thanks to them, we kept our sanity. And of course, we must thank the Institute of Biology and Molecular Medicine (IBMM) of the ULB to have hosted us throughout the summer.
We would also like to mention a few persons of the ULB outside our project but who helped us during our manipulations, by their advices or their kindness: Marie, Dukas, François from the LGPB and Didier Gonze for his help with modelling.
Finally, we would like to thank our collaborators: the people of the Brussels Game Festival for their wonderful event (more particularly Tanju Goban who as our contact person); FlandersBio and Brussels Life Tech (particularly Camille Mommers, our contact person) who gave us access to their network in our quest for sponsorship; Franck Delvigne from the University of Liège, for his proposition of help in the measurement of the efficacy of Mighty Coli; and at last the 10km of the ULB (Faculty of Sciences of the ULB), the Jean Brachet Funds, Wallonie-Brussels International, Eppendorf company and Greenwin for their financial support.

iGEM Team attributions page
Each team must clearly attribute work done by the student team members on this page.  The team must distinguish work done by the students from work done by others, including the host labs, advisors, instructors, and individuals not on the team roster.
Why do we have this requirement?
Attribution Template
We have this requirement to help the judges know what you did yourselves and what you had help with. We don't mind if you get help with difficult or complex techniques, just be sure to report the work your team did and the work that was done by others.
For example, you might choose to work with an animal model during your project. Working with animals requires getting a license and applying far in advance to conduct certain experiments in many countries. This is something that is difficult to achieve during the course of a summer, but much easier if you can work with a postdoc or PI who has the right licenses.
A great example of complete attribution comes from the Imperial College London 2011 team (scroll down to the bottom of their team page to see attributions).
Here are some of the fields we recommend you have on this page. If there are other areas not listed below, but applicable to your team/project, please feel free to also list them on your attributions page. Please feel free to remove any areas not applicable to your project.

From 2014.igem.org
Members
Hello everyone, Here is the team of WHU-China!  Team WHU-China 2014 was born at the foot of the mount LuoJia, November 2013. The team is mainly formed by sophomore and junior of the college of life sciences, Wuhan University. Our team has a great tradition and this year is the third time to join in the competition. In our warm small group, both sophomore and junior work together. We hope that we can learn more knowledge of synthetic biology and get access to more experimental skills by ourselves during the competition. What is more important is that we can make a contribution to the society. Let us join hands to swim in the vast ocean of synthetic biology and find treasures one by one!
Haoyuan Sun, as the captain of the team, is devoted himself into the completion. From the establishment of the project, to undertake the whole experiment guideline, he is just like a glaring star in the night to guide us where to go ahead. In the iGEM team, he not only uses his knowledge to solve the problems, but also encourages us by his humor to get through the difficulties. Besides the iGEM, he is skilled in playing ball games and telling jokes.
Hi, I am Zheng Sun, In the team of iGEM, everyone can find his/her own place, and iGEM has different meanings to different people. As for me, iGEM provides me with a great chance to explore the field of synthetic biology and the way to go into the society to touch different people and handle series of things I have never met before. Thanks iGEM for giving me such a chance and I believe this wonderful experience can leave me the beautiful memory and treasure in my life.
Here is Yun Xue, this is my first year in iGEM. I joined iGEM because I'm fond of synthetic biology and I'm skilled in the mathematical modeling, genetics and molecular biology. And I would like to pursue these interests in future and do research about mathematical modeling of biological systems. I enjoy sport activities such as badminton, tennis and basketball. I am lookng forward to solving problems and getting good achievements.
Qiushuang Wu: the smart girl provided us with the original idea for our project this year in the brainstorming. As the housekeeper in our lab, she kept the lab organized when doing experiments. And she herself did a lot of experiments, involving all parts in our project. As some people's comment, she was always in the lab or on the way to the lab. She usually says if love, please love deeply. She loves biology very much, and will devote to her true love all her life.
Long Yu, coming from Hubei, China, majors in biology in College of Life Sciences, Wuhan University. In his second year, he entered into the lab of Prof. Chen, whose field is microbiology. During those times, he was mainly devoted to reveal a new kind of mechanism by which genetic materials were transferred between Bacilus subtilis other than three traditional horizontal gene transfer (HGT) ways. In his third year, he participated in this iGEM team, and devoted much time into it, so granted, he learned a lot. But it is a pity that he could not keep it up. Now in his fourth year in college, he was prepared to go to Monash University in Australia, conducting researches about Tfh cells.
My name is Han Dong. I have been studying in Wuhan University for more than 2 years, majoring in biology. I was born in a coastal city named Qingdao, where I grew up with the sea, thus I like seafood, beach and sea breeze. Sea makes me open-minded, willing and have broad interests like swimming. I also enjoy reading and drawing, so I am the main graphic designer in our team. I believe that painting will help people to learn the world better by watching it carefully, and it is the same with biology. That is why I join the team , I want to show our idea with my pen.
I am Teng Li, a girl who loves reading and wants to make everyday in my life meaningful. I regard being an iGEMer a happy thing that deserves my devotion. All the iGEMers in our team are my friends and I do enjoy performing experiments and exchanging ideas with them. It is in iGEM that I learned how to cooperate, how to think and the basic skills for doing research of synthetic biology.
Hello! I am Zhengyu Luo, a senior student major in math and I am the computer engineer of the team in charge of the construction of the webpage. I like art and design and I am full of energy and prepared for any kind of challenges. Synthetic biology is a very hot subject these days so I joined WHU-China to learn something about it. I believe it must be a very interesting experience.
Hey guys! I'm Li Yuwenbin from Wuhan University, a team member of Whu-China. My job in our team mainly focuses on proving the function of E7 lysis protein as well as integrating it into our formaldehyde-terminator system, so that those functional enzymes can be secreted out into extracellular space to degrade formaldehyde more efficiently.  Besides biological research, I have a strong passion for various kinds of sports, like cycling, badminton and even x-game. I also have a special taste for music, poems and animation. iGEM jamboree has a lot of fun and it's so great to meet new friends and exchange ideas with each other in the competition. See you guys at MIT^ ^!
Hi there, this is Tianxing Zhai, a student of College of Life Sciences at Wuhan University. As a team member of WHU-China, I was responsible for the functional verification of formaldehyde dehydrogenase (spectrophotometry), some molecular cloning, and other non-experimental activities (e.g. ordering uniforms and badges). I am interested in making science more interesting and more widespread. If you and I are like-minded, please contact me. My Email is txzhai@whu.edu.cn.
Hi, I'm Bei Liu. I was in the lab of proteomics in Wuhan University. I did some experiments of biochemistry in the early stage. I also helped Haoyuan in organizing the team and putting up some ideas. Besides synthetic biology, I'm also interested in proteomics and neurogenesis. Now I'm doing an internship in UT Southwestern medical center in Dallas. It is really cool to participate in the giant jamboree in Boston, because Dallas is just like a large valley, while Boston is the true Big City. I hope I could spend some time visiting the city in the spare time during the jamboree.
I am Yao Chen, I still remember the first time I knew something nabout iGEM when I was a freshman, my classmate joined this team whereas I could only listen to his proud talking. Until last November I participated in the iGEM team for my dream. We experienced the hard Saturday night brainstorming and staying up late for presentation of our project and finally our sub-team project became the only project in the team. First I even could not understand what we would do but thanks for the team members, I made it clear ultimately.  To retrospect the last 10 months we went through the hardness and success which enrich my experience, broaden my horizon and give me friends. Now I am placid to write the story between iGEM and me and appreciate all the people helped us.
I am Shuohui Liu. During the four years in university, one could choose to sit around and achieve nothing. Or one could treasure the time to do something meaningful. The most meaningful thing for me is to join the iGEM. In the iGEM, one could do researches that are really special and interesting. One could also make friends and work in a team efficiently and comfortably. What's more, one could enjoy the best time in the life. In other words, the one in the iGEM is the most fortunate one in the word. Absolutely, I'm a guy like that.
Zhengwei Yuan| Senior in Biological Sciences Zhengwei is responsible for the separation of FDH (Formate dehydrogenase) gene from Candida boidinii which was bought from China Center of Industrial Culture Collection (CICC) and he work so hard with our team leader that they stay up late for three consecutive days to do the experiment. The main driving force of their diligence is the love for the iGEM and members in our team!
I joined iGEM-team at my second year of colleague. I chose life-science and wished to learn how to design a new life by myself. iGEM gives me the chance to know more and do more. Ideas will never appear suddenly - after the brain storm and layers of screening we got the amazing idea finally and had a colorful life in the lab for several mouths. I joined the human practice group at the last few weeks and did some help. Thanks to my teammates and teachers, we finished it quite well. I love dancing and reading novels. My favorite novel is Harry Potter and I don't think it is childish. Life is colorful, both in the lab and outside.
My name is Lei He coming from Wuhan University school of pharmaceutical science. Because of my enthusiasm and teachers' help, I have got a rich experience of experiment. But being an iGEMer of a great team is the most exciting part.

Hi I'm Chen Xi or you can call me Fred. As a senior year student, I'm grateful to be a member of this excellent miracle-making team. My work in this project involves source gathering, plasmids design. I am so glad that our idea and the outcome can now have a chance to be presented to the world and let people know how the bioengineering can create a formaldehyde toxicity free world.
My name is Ji Yang. I am a senior student in College of life science, Wuhan University. It's a great honor to be a part of the 2014-WHU-China team. In the team, my responsibility is to assist Luo Zhengyu to construct our web page and collect some necessary text material. We would use some fancy CSS and JavaScript techniques to make our page more attractive and more creative. I wish our work could present you a clear and insight web page.
Qi Wang| Senior in Biology science Qi is really a shy and introverted girl. She does not like to talk with other members very much, but she is willing to be a good listener. A good team needs not only someone who is eloquent enough to keep us together, but someone who dedicated himself silently like Qi. And she is very serious with her work. She worked in the lab for our project in the summer vacation.
Hi! I am Man Li from WHU-China. I met iGEM one year ago and I am totally into it. In my mind, iGEM is not a competition merely but a club. In this club, students who have the same interests in genetically engineering work together. We set our goals, and achieve some ridiculous ideas. As for myself, I am an outgoing girl. For me, research in biology is one part of my life. In my mind, the quality of life is equally important to the achievement I make in biology. I play violin in my spare times, and enjoy the peaceful afternoons. In WHU-China, I am the one who mobilize the atmospheres in our laboratory and cheer others up.
I'm Rui Bai, a senior student majored in life science, I'm so lucky to be a part of our awesome WHU-iGEM. Before entering the team, I have participated in a molecular biology lab for a year. Because of curiosity, I joined in our team to broaden knowledge of synthetic biology and share ideas with coworkers, which we called brainstorming. Now I think it has been one of the most correct choices which I have made in my college. What's more, I am good at organizing activities for heading up the Student Union. And I also have an appetite for drawing and basketball.
Xi Tu| Senior in Biological Sciences Xi joined the team, wondering how synthetic biology works. He takes part in discuss the idea and good at primer design.

Teambuilding Events
Raft Building and Floating
As we had a lot of fun inside in our lab, we mostly saw nice artificial light. To change this, we decided to go out and expose ourselves to the sun and have more good time together in an unusual habitat. Beside some other ideas it became clear that we would take action and build up several rafts on the Möhlin, a small river near Freiburg. At the beginning we had only 12 blue barrels, a few planks and ropes and also no idea how to build up a floating thing out of these components. But after around 75 minutes and with a little advice, we had our rafts ready to sail. We started with a hesitant tryout but as time flies by, we felt safer and became venturesome. As a conclusion we ended up with capsized rafts and soggy sailors. However and possibly even because of these incidents we had unbridled fun!  In addition, the weather was with us as it was raining during the arrival and also 15 minutes after we came off our rafts. At the same time we did something for our environment and rescued small hatchlings from drowning.

We'd like to thank Ms. Dr. Nicole Gensch, head of BIOSS' Toolbox. The Toolbox is a BIOSS internal provider of plasmids, agar plates, buffer, LB media, cell lines or antibodies. She's one of our instructors and provided us always with knowledge and lab materials. Not alone she gave us great advices but had the creative idea for our logo! With her alert mind, she had a strong influence on our weekly meetings and lab methods.
Mr. Dr. Max Ulbrich
Max Ulbrich, head of AG Ulbrich at BIOSS, is our main source of advice. His proposals and critiques showed us many times, where we had to improve our experiments, what aspects were very important or in which direction the project should go on. Furthermore he used his connections to other university groups to get us plasmids or contact persons. As the lab time began he equiped us missing stuff. Later on he lent us almost everything what we had need of helped us in the lab.
Anne Müller, Patrick Gonschorek, Lisa Schmunk (AG Weber), Natalie Louis (AG Warscheid)
All four are iGEM veterans. They participated in 2013 and were very successful. From the beginning they helped us with advices and opinions to our ideas and lab methods and were in every meeting. Additional they stayed in the lab with us during many nights.

For his support regarding production of viral particles and their concentration.
Kathrin Kläsener (AG Reth)
She helped us with her knowledge about cell culture.
Giulia Mizzon
For her help with the confocal microscope.

They work both at the BIOSS administration and helped us in many things, which happened besides the lab. Ms. Reulecke registered our team and was a great help especially in the beginning. Katrin Pensold is BIOSS financial minister. She made sure that we filled out any forms and gave us monetary advices.
Martin Senk
Martin Senk is a friend of one team member. He's a genious in programming and was a very great help in writing our wiki.
Pablo Grassi
Pablo Grassi's passion is philosophy. He provied us not only us with advices in ethical questions but the last teams too.

Teambuilding Events
Raft Building and Floating
As we had a lot of fun inside in our lab, we mostly saw nice artificial light. To change this, we decided to go out and expose ourselves to the sun and have more good time together in an unusual habitat. Beside some other ideas it became clear that we would take action and build up several rafts on the Möhlin, a small river near Freiburg. At the beginning we had only 12 blue barrels, a few planks and ropes and also no idea how to build up a floating thing out of these components. But after around 75 minutes and with a little advice, we had our rafts ready to sail. We started with a hesitant tryout but as time flies by, we felt safer and became venturesome. As a conclusion we ended up with capsized rafts and soggy sailors. However and possibly even because of these incidents we had unbridled fun!  In addition, the weather was with us as it was raining during the arrival and also 15 minutes after we came off our rafts. At the same time we did something for our environment and rescued small hatchlings from drowning.

Collaborations
Heidelberg
We are glad to cooperate this year for the second time in succession with the motivated iGEM Team Heidelberg. As some of our team leaders were in the last years’ iGEM-Team, we knew about the spirit of Heidelberg’ teams and were hopeful to have a great collaboration as well as a lot of fun with them.
Fortunately, three members of them decided to meet us spontaneously after a demanding meeting within our team. The evening turned out to become great including stories about iGEM, local gastronomic specialities typical for Freiburg or Heidelberg and much more. The next day, we talked about our projects and possibilities to cooperate. It turned out that both teams use the same light system (LOV) for their experiments, although one – their team – worked with bacteria, the other one – our team – with mammalian cells. We showed them where we are working, how we work and presented our latest experimental results. In addition, we talked about the light boxes wherein we conduct our light experiments and about the appropriate conditions of a light experiment.
After we had explained to them how to handle mammalian cells, we heard some information about their interesting project “iGEM@home” that includes the possibility to share unnecessary resources of the computer to speed up modeling of complex protein structures. In terms of important aspects of their project, we were interested in their weekly published blog. A few weeks later, Team Heidelberg gave us the possibility to write a text for their blog about light induction systems, a central part of their and our project. Their blog is released every Monday. HERE you can read the text that was published on the blog. As a quid pro quo, they helped us by modeling our system: as they had a lot of modeling work in their project, they could give us helpful advices to improve our modeling.
 
 
Aachen
We noticed during the meetup in Munich that we our both teams had a good foundation for a coopartion. We skyped several times discussing our projects and how to exactly work together to bring our both teams forward. We also had the pleasure of meeting Micheal face to face when he spontanously showed up in Freiburg.  In addition, we met again at the Aachen meetup and finalized the collaboration. Team Aachen helped us by providing us with laser-cutted photomasks for 384 well plates that made it possible to generate QR-codes on 384 well plates.  They also started to generate an app for us that is able to scan a cell culture plate and read out the gained data-matrix. The Application is based on Windows Phone 8. Michael programmed it for us and was very helpful during the trouble shooting process. However, as we started the collaboration a bit too late, the app could not be finished. Nevertheless, it could be shown that in principle, a data matrix can be read by the app. The app acts intuitive, quick and easy and promotes various application areas in the future.

We returned the favour by validating their measurment  device for the ascertainment of optical densites. As we knew that they generated their data for procaryotic cells and they had no possibility to work with mammalian cells, we measured the OD for mammalian cell suspensions.
We made dilution series of a murine cell lines (NIH3T3) with a starting cell number of 10^6 cells per ml, what is a realistic working density and measured the transmission of light with a prototype of their device. In parallel we measured the optical density (OD) of each sample with NanoDrop. To verify the data we performed the experiment with biological as well as with technical triplicates. Cells were diluted in completed growth medium to simulate realistic conditions. Providing these data for Team Aachen they could calculate the true OD value of each sample. The Team incorporated our measured data in their project.
Darmstadt
Team Darmstadt exchanged knowledge with us regarding the usage of the fluorescent marker mKate that we used in our cloning strategy. In addition, they helped us by distributing our survey.
Gatherings
RWTH Aachen
After the meetup in Munich we also went to the Aachen meetup. It was really nice to meet the other teams and to see how their projects have progressed since the last meetup. Also we were very grateful for the opportunity to present our project and getting feedback.
LMU Munich
To get in touch with other iGEM teams we took part in two meet ups. The first one was organized from the team of the LMU Munich. We did this and that, and socialized much those days. We exchanged among the different teams and we came to the conclusion to set up a collaboration with the iGEM team Aachen.
A Proposal Of The German iGEM Teams Concerning Intellectual Property
During the meetup of the German iGEM teams from 23rd to 25th May also workshops took place in which amongst others we discussed the topic of bioethics. Moral questions were addressed, regarding the value of life and human influence on it, as well as questions dealing with the possible socioeconomic effects of synthetic biology.
Especially the topic of an open source vs. patent controlled field accounted for a large part of the discussion. During the discussion one student brought up the point that the legal status of parts in registry remains unclear and that there are parts (e.g. BBa_K180009 ) where only upon a closer look it becomes clear that the rights are company–owned. The issue that the legal status of parts in the registry remains uncertain is also mentioned in a recent article published by Nature ( Bryn Nelson ‘Synthetic Biology: Cultural Divide ’, Nature 509, 152–154, 08 May 2014 ) :
""[N]o one can say with any certainty how many of these parts are themselves entirely free of patent claims.""
We, the German iGEM teams, therefore like to suggest the addition of a new feature to the parts registry:
A dedicated data field of license information for each BioBrick part.
For the implementation, we propose to introduce two new fields to BioBrick part entries in the registry:
A string property ""LicenseInfo""
A traffic light property (grey, green, yellow, red) to indicate the level of legal protection (unknown, BPA-like, free for research purposes, heavily protected)
Implementing this feature would in our opinion further clarify and extend the parts info, provide a machine-readable format and thus improve future entries. With the emerging Entrepreneurship track and applications getting closer to industrial realization, the legal status becomes more and more important. Also it would raise awareness to the topic of the legal status of parts, leading to a debate which could further promote the idea of open source. At the same time we hope that examination of most parts will show that they are indeed free of restrictive legal protections.

Collaborations
Heidelberg
We are glad to cooperate this year for the second time in succession with the motivated iGEM Team Heidelberg. As some of our team leaders were in the last years’ iGEM-Team, we knew about the spirit of Heidelberg’ teams and were hopeful to have a great collaboration as well as a lot of fun with them.
Fortunately, three members of them decided to meet us spontaneously after a demanding meeting within our team. The evening turned out to become great including stories about iGEM, local gastronomic specialities typical for Freiburg or Heidelberg and much more. The next day, we talked about our projects and possibilities to cooperate. It turned out that both teams use the same light system (LOV) for their experiments, although one – their team – worked with bacteria, the other one – our team – with mammalian cells. We showed them where we are working, how we work and presented our latest experimental results. In addition, we talked about the light boxes wherein we conduct our light experiments and about the appropriate conditions of a light experiment.
After we had explained to them how to handle mammalian cells, we heard some information about their interesting project “iGEM@home” that includes the possibility to share unnecessary resources of the computer to speed up modeling of complex protein structures. In terms of important aspects of their project, we were interested in their weekly published blog. A few weeks later, Team Heidelberg gave us the possibility to write a text for their blog about light induction systems, a central part of their and our project. Their blog is released every Monday. HERE you can read the text that was published on the blog. As a quid pro quo, they helped us by modeling our system: as they had a lot of modeling work in their project, they could give us helpful advices to improve our modeling.
 
 
Aachen
We noticed during the meetup in Munich that we our both teams had a good foundation for a coopartion. We skyped several times discussing our projects and how to exactly work together to bring our both teams forward. We also had the pleasure of meeting Micheal face to face when he spontanously showed up in Freiburg.  In addition, we met again at the Aachen meetup and finalized the collaboration. Team Aachen helped us by providing us with laser-cutted photomasks for 384 well plates that made it possible to generate QR-codes on 384 well plates.  They also started to generate an app for us that is able to scan a cell culture plate and read out the gained data-matrix. The Application is based on Windows Phone 8. Michael programmed it for us and was very helpful during the trouble shooting process. However, as we started the collaboration a bit too late, the app could not be finished. Nevertheless, it could be shown that in principle, a data matrix can be read by the app. The app acts intuitive, quick and easy and promotes various application areas in the future.

We returned the favour by validating their measurment  device for the ascertainment of optical densites. As we knew that they generated their data for procaryotic cells and they had no possibility to work with mammalian cells, we measured the OD for mammalian cell suspensions.
We made dilution series of a murine cell lines (NIH3T3) with a starting cell number of 10^6 cells per ml, what is a realistic working density and measured the transmission of light with a prototype of their device. In parallel we measured the optical density (OD) of each sample with NanoDrop. To verify the data we performed the experiment with biological as well as with technical triplicates. Cells were diluted in completed growth medium to simulate realistic conditions. Providing these data for Team Aachen they could calculate the true OD value of each sample. The Team incorporated our measured data in their project.
Darmstadt
Team Darmstadt exchanged knowledge with us regarding the usage of the fluorescent marker mKate that we used in our cloning strategy. In addition, they helped us by distributing our survey.
Gatherings
RWTH Aachen
After the meetup in Munich we also went to the Aachen meetup. It was really nice to meet the other teams and to see how their projects have progressed since the last meetup. Also we were very grateful for the opportunity to present our project and getting feedback.
LMU Munich
To get in touch with other iGEM teams we took part in two meet ups. The first one was organized from the team of the LMU Munich. We did this and that, and socialized much those days. We exchanged among the different teams and we came to the conclusion to set up a collaboration with the iGEM team Aachen.
A Proposal Of The German iGEM Teams Concerning Intellectual Property
During the meetup of the German iGEM teams from 23rd to 25th May also workshops took place in which amongst others we discussed the topic of bioethics. Moral questions were addressed, regarding the value of life and human influence on it, as well as questions dealing with the possible socioeconomic effects of synthetic biology.
Especially the topic of an open source vs. patent controlled field accounted for a large part of the discussion. During the discussion one student brought up the point that the legal status of parts in registry remains unclear and that there are parts (e.g. BBa_K180009 ) where only upon a closer look it becomes clear that the rights are company–owned. The issue that the legal status of parts in the registry remains uncertain is also mentioned in a recent article published by Nature ( Bryn Nelson ‘Synthetic Biology: Cultural Divide ’, Nature 509, 152–154, 08 May 2014 ) :
""[N]o one can say with any certainty how many of these parts are themselves entirely free of patent claims.""
We, the German iGEM teams, therefore like to suggest the addition of a new feature to the parts registry:
A dedicated data field of license information for each BioBrick part.
For the implementation, we propose to introduce two new fields to BioBrick part entries in the registry:
A string property ""LicenseInfo""
A traffic light property (grey, green, yellow, red) to indicate the level of legal protection (unknown, BPA-like, free for research purposes, heavily protected)
Implementing this feature would in our opinion further clarify and extend the parts info, provide a machine-readable format and thus improve future entries. With the emerging Entrepreneurship track and applications getting closer to industrial realization, the legal status becomes more and more important. Also it would raise awareness to the topic of the legal status of parts, leading to a debate which could further promote the idea of open source. At the same time we hope that examination of most parts will show that they are indeed free of restrictive legal protections.

Erin Weese: Notebook
Erin is a fifth year Microbiology and Spanish senior minoring in Chemistry (and currently struggling through Physical Chemistry). She has previously served as the Assistant Captain and serves this year as the team Captain, working mainly to acquire funding for the team, oversee research planning, and overall team functioning. After studying abroad in Peru (where she plans to consume copious amounts of ceviche), she plans to attend graduate school to pursue a Ph.D. in the fields of molecular virology, infectious disease, and the human microbiome. Her interests outside of the lab include Latin dance, Latin American culture, and New Girl.
Samuel Jones: Notebook
Once upon a time, in a galaxy far, but quite near actually, a young man by the name of Samuel Jones was born. Through a series of trials, tribulations, and random flirtations, Samuel has progressed through a life that currently culminates in being engaged to the loves of his life, Science and his fiancée, Mandy. He is the head researcher on the iGEM team and the president of the local chapter of ASM. He hopes to marry Mandy soon and go to graduate school for virology while developing his interest in mycology as a hobby.
Justin Montgomery: Notebook
I reside at the University of Oklahoma majoring in Neurobiology with a sub-focus in microbiology. This year being my senior year I’ve spent nearly a year and a half working alongside OU iGEM in the lab, aka my second home, where I have served as secretary. I recorded the main notebook. Outside of the academic setting, I appreciate a nice cup of coffee and a good Netflix marathon during the winter months. Recently I’ve gotten into wakeboarding at a local cable park. All in all my passion lies with the brain and its limitless ability to create great things and make the world just that much nicer.
Meredith Thornton: Notebook
Meredith Thornton is a senior in Microbiology with a minor in Chemistry. Her contributions to the iGEM team include primary lab work throughout the spring and summer and outreach coordination. She is interested in pursuing a master's degree in environmental microbiology with an emphasis in biocorrosion and bioremediation. She is also involved in the ASM student chapter at OU as the treasurer and a member of the OU women's rowing team for the past three years.
Benjamin Hickerson: Notebook
My name is Benjamin Hickerson. I am a microbiology-major at the University of Oklahoma, and it is my fifth year. My involvement with the iGEM team at OU ranges from wet work, to public interaction.  So I do a lot of work in the lab, but I have also helped with outreach, and have been acting as the Treasurer of our organization. I certainly have an interest in genetic engineering. I almost feel like I am using really complex Legos to create something outside of the instruction manual. Though my eventual goal is to go into the health field.
Zachariah Herron
Zachariah is a Chemistry major attempting to finish out his degree. He has spent an inordinate amount of time crouched in front of analytical instruments, experiments, and computers. When he is not furthering his education, he is working or drowning himself in videos, manga, music, and books. Most of the time, it is several things at once. His role on this team has been media and wiki development. He also assists the others where necessary.
Adviser
Dr. Boris Wawrik: linkedin
Dr. Wawrik is the current adviser of the team. He teaches microbiology classes and performs his research on the marine microbiome at the University of Oklahoma.

Team GES NCSU Raleigh NC
Jennifer Baltzegar
Jen is an IGERT fellow and a Ph.D. student in Genetics, with a minor in Genetic Engineering and Society.
Project Focus: She has helped to write sections for different principles as well as developed the wiki and populated the Environmental Health portion of the concept map.
Academic Focus: Jen is broadly interested in studying the differences between populations and species via mechanisms of evolution and impacts of population change, and she is particularly interested in studying the impacts of genetic engineering in agricultural pest species.
Downtime Focus: She enjoys running, camping, playing with her dog, and renovating her house.
Johanna Elsensohn
Johanna is an IGERT fellow and a Ph.D. student in Entomology, with a minor in Genetic Engineering and Society.
Project focus: A bit of everything. She helped write sections for several of the core principles. She also helped design the concept map and helped put the poster together.
Academic focus: Johanna studies the ecology and behavior of agricultural pests in order to develop control solutions within an Integrated Pest Management framework. Genetic pest management has the potential to be an effective tool in IPM. However, the appropriateness of the new technology needs to address social and cultural concerns in addition to overcoming technological barriers. She joined the iGEM team because she's interested in studying the social, ethical, and legal issues that surround the release of new technology.
Downtime focus: When not chained to the computer or in the field, Johanna can be found either in the mountains exploring new places with her dog, out on the water kayaking, or in the kitchen concocting something delicious!
Sheron King
Sheron is an IGERT fellow and a Ph.D. student in Public Administration, with a minor in Genetic Engineering and Society.
Project focus: She has assisted with identifying and developing a few of the core principles; assisted putting the poster together as well as ensuring team wiki pages have been completed.

Academic focus: Professor in Science communication at NCSU, I run PCOST (Public Communication of Science and Technology) where I work with faculty and students in different areas of communication: currently we have two projects: one on synthetic biology and the public and a second on climate change communication visualization (see PCOST.org). I am funded to work with the LAS (Laboratory of Analytic Sciences) to help develop analytic tools and toolboxes to improve analytics in foreign affairs. I am working on a user experience lab project at NCSU as well. I am a GES fellow and am working on two projects: one on the DIY Community and another examining the iGEM community and the jamboree as a communication event.
Downtime focus: I read a lot, write in fiction (have an agent) as well as non-fiction and academese, and serve as a risk communication advisor to the US FDA and the American Heart Association.
Jennifer Kuzma
Dr. Jennifer Kuzma joined North Carolina State University in August 2013 as the Chancellor’s Faculty Excellence Program to co- direct the Genetic Engineering and Society Center. She is the Goodnight-Glaxo Wellcome Distinguished Professor in the College of Humanities and Social Sciences and Professor in the School of Public and International Affairs. She will also teach and advise students in the NSF-IGERT funded Ph.D. minor program on Genetic Engineering and Society: The Case of Genetic Pest Management. Her research focuses on governance systems for emerging technologies, particularly genetic engineering for environmental, agricultural, health and industrial applications. Currently, emerging technologies are moving at a rapid pace, but often societal responses lag behind. Understanding the social-ecological-technological systems and the underlying dynamics can help to guide decisions-makers and the public towards better governance models. With these goals in mind, she explores the values, organizations, and outcomes associated with existing oversight systems in order to inform future policy-making. Her work draws on developing methods for integrating multiple disciplines in a policy sciences approach. It is also translational, striving to engage and serve stakeholders and citizens who come from a variety of perspectives and expertise areas. As such, she and colleague Professor Fred Gould (CALS) will co-direct a new center on Genetic Engineering and Society to help support bi-directional learning and communication among academe and public and private organizations.
Kuzma was a faculty member in the Humphrey School of Public Affairs at the University of Minnesota (UMN) for 10 years in the Science, Technology and Environmental Policy area. At UMN, she was the recipient of several NSF and other grants in areas related to Science and Technology (S&T) Policy, including a current NSF grant which is the first to investigate the prevalence and experiences of women in science and technology policy leadership positions. She is viewed as a leader in the S&T Policy academic community and was elected by her peers to chair the Gordon Conference on S&T Policy in 2014. She has published over 90 academic articles, book chapters and policy reports in emerging technologies and governance. She has helped to establish and worked closely with several interdisciplinary initiatives at UMN, including the Initiative on Governance of Emerging Technological Systems, the Institute on the Environment, and the NSF-IGERT on Risk Analysis for Introduced Species and Genotypes. She has held and currently holds several board and advisory positions, including Chair of the Society for Risk Analysis section on Risk Policy and Law, Minnesota Governor’s Bioscience Advisory Committee, the Executive Committee of the Society for the Study of Nanoscience and Emerging Technologies (S-NET), the European Commission Expert Group for 2011 Science in Society Work Programme, the Expert Group for the EU’s ‘SYNTH-ETHICS’ project, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Blood Products Advisory Committee, and the UN WHO-FAO Joint Expert Group for the Applications of Nanotechnologies to the Food and Agriculture Sectors. Prior to entering academe, she served as program and study director for several U.S. National Academy of Sciences reports related to biotechnology governance and bioterrorism and as an American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) Risk Policy Fellow at the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
Advisors
Antony Evans
Antony has an MBA with Distinction from INSEAD, an MA in Maths from the University of Cambridge and is a graduate of Singularity University’s GSP program. He is both a Louis Frank and Oppidan scholar and worked for six years as a management consultant and project manager at Oliver Wyman and Bain & Company. Prior to this project he co-founded the world’s first pure mobile microfinance bank in the Philippines and launched a mobile app in partnership with Harvard Medical School.
Antony is the Chief Executive Officer. His job is to free up the research team so they can concentrate on product development, which means leading marketing, sales, fundraising, external communications, regulation and HR.
Andrew Maynard
NSF International Chair of Environmental Health Sciences. Chair, University of Michigan Environmental Health Sciences Department. Director, University of Michigan Risk Science Center.
Academic Focus: Andrew Maynard directs the University of Michigan Risk Science Center, chairs the Department of Environmental Health Sciences in the U-M School of Public Health, and is the NSF International Chair of Environmental Health Sciences (the National Sanitation Foundation, not the National Science Foundation). When not up to his eyeballs in academic administration, his work focuses on the responsible development and use of emerging technologies – most notably nanotechnology and synthetic biology. He is currently vice-chair of the World Economic Forum Global Agenda Council on Nanotechnology, and has worked with a number of organizations on understanding the risks and benefits of technology innovation, including the National Academies of Science and the President’s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology. Andrew previously served as co-chair of the multi-agency Nanotechnology Environmental and Health Implications working group, and between 2005 – 2010 was science advisor to the Woodrow Wilson Center project on Emerging Nanotechnologies. Much of Andrew’s current work is focused on effective evidence-based risk communication, and he is leading a number of efforts through the University of Michigan Risk Science Center to connect expert knowledge with non-expert audiences. He writes broadly on science, risk and communication on his blog – 2020 Science – and is responsible for the innovative Risk Bites channel on YouTube; something he is publicly embarrassed about but privately rather pleased with.
Downtime Focus: When not administering, researching, pontificating and communicating, Andrew tries to hide away with a good book and good music – preferably played on an exquisitely fine audio system. He’s also been known to fly a kite, but only when no-one’s looking.

Attributions
iGEM Team attributions page
Each team must clearly attribute work done by the student team members on this page.  The team must distinguish work done by the students from work done by others, including the host labs, advisors, instructors, and individuals not on the team roster.
Why do we have this requirement?
Attribution Template
We have this requirement to help the judges know what you did yourselves and what you had help with. We don't mind if you get help with difficult or complex techniques, just be sure to report the work your team did and the work that was done by others.
For example, you might choose to work with an animal model during your project. Working with animals requires getting a license and applying far in advance to conduct certain experiments in many countries. This is something that is difficult to achieve during the course of a summer, but much easier if you can work with a postdoc or PI who has the right licenses.
A great example of complete attribution comes from the Imperial College London 2011 team (scroll down to the bottom of their team page to see attributions).
Here are some of the fields we recommend you have on this page. If there are other areas not listed below, but applicable to your team/project, please feel free to also list them on your attributions page. Please feel free to remove any areas not applicable to your project.
General Support
Project support and advice
Fundraising help and advice
Lab support
Difficult technique support
Project advisor support
Wiki support
Presentation coaching
Policy & Practices support
Thanks and acknowledgements for all other people involved in helping make a successful iGEM team.

Suneet Kharey
My name is Suneet, isn't that so neat? I'm a science loving, caffeine based life-form. My humour goes greatly under-appreciated, my socks never match, and I still have all of my wisdom teeth. I feel that my exceptional Sudoku skills make me a more well-rounded individual. Back for round 2 of iGEM and I couldn't be more excited!
Graeme Glaister
I am currently finishing up my Bsc. in Neuroscience and working as a server / bartender on the weekends. This is my second year in iGEM and i look forward to the worlds competion in boston. Its always interesting to see what all the teams projects are as each year i learn something new. I also enjoy long walks on the beach and sunsets preferably both happening at the same time.
Zak Stinson
Hey, I'm Zak, and I am an iGEMmer. I thought I was almost free of my fascination with genetic technologies when I transferred to the neuroscience program at the U of L in 2011 from biology at the U of R, but I lapsed right back when I learned that iGEM existed. I thought I had refocused when I began doing behavioural experiments with rats, but immediately searched out and executed a synthetic biology project designing a system for reporting gene activity in the brains of live animals. After completing my B.Sc. in neuroscience this summer I will likely continue to design synthetic biology projects in the M.Sc. neuroscience program at the U of L as I am dangerously hooked. So I guess I'll talk to you all next year!
Dustin Smith
Hello, my name is Dustin Smith. I was born and raised in Lethbridge, and I am a Master’s student majoring in Biochemistry. I’m happy to be back with the University of Lethbridge iGEM team for a fourth year, and as always it has been a great experience. Outside of school my favorite activities are ice hockey, snowboarding, and lifting.
Aubrey Demchuk
I am a graduate student pursuing a M.Sc. degree in Neuroscience but joined the iGEM team because I started my science career as a synthetic biology geek (with a B.Sc. in Molecular Genetics). I am also a full-time research technician at the Canadian Centre for Behavioural Neuroscience, an avid volunteer for Let’s Talk Science and a relentless adrenaline junkie (with a seriously unhealthy obsession for bikes). If you can’t find me behind a lab bench, I’m busy getting lost in the mountains.
Scott Wong
Scott was born in Calgary but after graduating high school he quickly moved out to explore the world. However, he only made it as far as Lethbridge. There he completed a B.Sc. in Neuroscience and is currently working on a Master’s degree in the same field. What attracted him to iGEM was the opportunity to combine his interests in the brain and synthetic biology while working on a project with relevant implications in treating brain disease.
Dennis Bettenson
Hi, my name is Dennis Bettenson, I'm a fifth year Neuroscience major and the University of Lethbridge. The main focus of my studies has been on trying to understand the underlying, neurobiological mechanisms of memory and spatial navigation. This is my first year on the Lethbridge iGEM team, and I have learned so much about synthetic biology and how it can be used in neuroscience. Aside from studying and researching, I am also an avid gamer and amateur musician!
Kelsey O'Brien
I am an undergraduate student majoring in neuroscience.  My main research interest involves elucidating the neurobiological effects of wrackspurt invasion of the human brain.  I am proudly multilingual: I speak fluent English, Gibberish, Mermish, Gobbledegook, and French.
Billy Cowitz
I am a second year B.Sc neuroscience student and this is my first year in iGEM. I had never heard of iGEM before but after getting to university and hearing some people talk about it I thought it would be an interesting thing to be a part of. It has been fun and provided me with great new experiences that not many people get to enjoy.
Evan Caton
Hi. My name is Evan Caton. I am currently a Ph.D. candidate in Biomolecular Sciences at the University of Lethbridge. I am actively involved in volunteering and teaching at the University both in the teaching labs and in the research labs. What brought me to iGEM was the ability to be involved in project design and troubleshooting. I like problem solving and team activities.
Rachael Chan
Hi, my name is Rachael and I am a second year undergraduate student here at the U of L. I had known about iGEM in high school, but was unfortunately unable to join so when I heard about the opportunity again in post-secondary, I was intrigued. Besides being the typical undergrad student lacking time for most activities, I enjoy coaching/playing volleyball, baking, traveling, and attempting to be musically inclined.
Rhys Hakstol
I am a graduate of the U of L, and will be starting a Master’s Degree in Biochemistry in 2015. This is my first year with iGEM, so I’m looking forward to learning lots at this year’s competition.  I’m the proud owner of over a dozen nicknames. When I’m not in the lab I can be found on the basketball court, volunteering with Let’s Talk Science, eating beef jerky or having debates about superheroes.
Harland Brandon
Returning for a fifth year to the iGEM scene, I have taken an advisory role mentoring the team. Currently I am working on my PhD in Biomolecular Science which takes up the majority of my time. With what spare time I have left I am advising our iGEM or taste-testing some fine strong Scottish beverages.
Supervisor: Hans-Joachim Wieden
Originally from Germany I moved to Canada in 2005 to start a research group on the structure and function of the bacterial protein synthesis machinery, a cellular process targeted by over 50% of the known antibiotics. I am intrigued by the molecular design and function of this essential bio-nanomachine. I try to unravel the underlying design principles in order to enable the rational design and engineering of novel bio-nanomachines. I am essentially asking the question if such novel bio-machines can be constructed from simple and fundamental principles or are these assemblies just too complex. Well and that’s why it was extremely easy to rope me into doing iGEM.
Supervisor: A. Will Smith
I am an orphan found on a raft in the Old Man river. From the sisters who were raising me and teaching me Latin and Greek, I was kidnapped and taken to Africa to be a slave porter to carry expedition gear for a tyrant who wanted to climb Mt. Kilimanjaro. However, I escaped and hid in a cave, where I found dinosaur remains and diamonds. I told some Canadian researcher about the bones [and he later became famous] and then I took the diamonds and found my way on a steamship going to the ivory coast. There were some bad guys who blew up the ship, and I swam as fast as I could, but lost my left foot to a crocodile that had a ticking sound coming from its belly. There was a balloonist in antique clothing who was trying to gather wood to continue his journey, and though I only spoke Latin and Greek, I understood that he had traveled through time and he could take me with him. Since it was so hard to walk now with my only foot, I thought it might be a good idea to float on the wind, so I took a diamond and bought a lot of bananas, coconuts, and dried insects for us to eat on our journey. And the rest of my history is just as non-descript. The bananas turned black and rotted, but they smelled good.
Now I try to be as anonymous as possible, but I do realize that I am not going to live forever. I do speak several artistic languages, including sound design and human movement design. I started the New Media Program at the University of Lethbridge and have been living in Lethbridge for 15 years.

iGEM Team attributions page
Each team must clearly attribute work done by the student team members on this page.  The team must distinguish work done by the students from work done by others, including the host labs, advisors, instructors, and individuals not on the team roster.
Why do we have this requirement?
Attribution Template
We have this requirement to help the judges know what you did yourselves and what you had help with. We don't mind if you get help with difficult or complex techniques, just be sure to report the work your team did and the work that was done by others.
For example, you might choose to work with an animal model during your project. Working with animals requires getting a license and applying far in advance to conduct certain experiments in many countries. This is something that is difficult to achieve during the course of a summer, but much easier if you can work with a postdoc or PI who has the right licenses.
A great example of complete attribution comes from the Imperial College London 2011 team (scroll down to the bottom of their team page to see attributions).
Here are some of the fields we recommend you have on this page. If there are other areas not listed below, but applicable to your team/project, please feel free to also list them on your attributions page. Please feel free to remove any areas not applicable to your project.
General Support
Project support and advice
Fundraising help and advice
Lab support
Difficult technique support
Project advisor support
Wiki support

""I joined iGEM my freshman year because it seemed like a good way to learn more about biological research and to get involved with a group of students with similar interests.  My involvement in iGEM has helped me to grow as a leader and as a team member.  Working with the iGEM team at Missouri S&T has provided invaluable lessons that will help me to further advance my career as a scientist.""
Katherine Nelson
Public Relations Officer
Biological Sciences
""I joined iGEM my sophomore year of college hoping to get more involved in lab work on campus. My freshman year I did not do too well in some of my classes and I had not joined many clubs on campus. I had been interested in working in a lab where I could interact with my fellow students and I was interested in many of the ideas from past iGEM projects. I joined to get more hands on experience in labs and to learn more about the field of biology. After joining the public relations committee I became more involved with outreach events and teaching students about synthetic biology. After the first month that I joined I realized that I was much more passionate about teaching and talking then I was about lab work. I am a now a senior in Biological Sciences with a minor in Chemistry and Psychology and the PR officer of iGEM. I could not have asked for a better experience in working with others and putting on outreach events. ""
Nocona Sanders
Treasurer
Physics/Applied Math
""I joined iGEM because I've always had an interest in biology. As an incoming freshman, it was a hard decision for me to choose a degree path because I wanted to study so many things. Even though I ended up going with physics and math, I still wanted to fuel my passion for biology. However it wasn't until the end of my freshman year that I heard about iGEM. The team's PR committee put on a program at TJ called ""Play With DNA."" It involved extracting DNA from bananas and seeing the chains it created. I had a vague idea of what synthetic biology was before that event, but I understood it a lot more clearly after that discussion. After that program, I started going to iGEM meetings, learning about synthetic biology, and getting involved. That's kept going until today.""
Kelsey Crossen
Secretary
Biological Sciences
""I switched my major to Biological Sciences after my freshman year and I joined iGEM because I thought genetic engineering work sounded really cool. My future goals include going to grad school and having a career doing research, so having lab experience through iGEM was something that I really wanted to get involved in.""
Matthew Lindner
Web Master
Computer Science
""I first heard of iGem through my roommate. He told me about some of the research the team was doing, and I was blown away. I started going to weekly meetings to learn more about their projects. I stuck around because I wanted to learn how a Computer Science student could help a synthetic biology group.""
Kira Buckowing
Lab Manager
Biochemical Engineering
""Basically I joined iGEM because I thought it was interesting and I saw application possibilities for what we do. I have always liked genetics and being able to do something applicable with such made me really want to get involved. I like all the possibilities available and all that teams have been able to do or will be able to do in the future - it is really just amazing to me. I would like for things like what iGEM teams do to become more common place in the future and actually get more implemented than they are now, and I really care about the organization as a whole because of this and want it to be the best thing that it can be - both on our campus and worldwide.""

Levi Palmer
Former Lab Manager
Chemical Engineering
""In high school biology, we learned about a chemical called Sonic Hedgehog. It's a growth factor that helps stem cells differentiate and become mature cell types (e.g. skin, muscle, blood cells). When I learned that we could control what stem cells became, I was hooked on biology. I continued to feed this fascination over the next few years by reading anything I could get on biology. In a book of scientific articles, I found one on gene therapy, which is replacing ""faulty"" genes with healthy ones. For me, this was the start of thinking about modifying DNA to fix problems or even to make completely new phenotypes.
I went to 5 booths at Minerama, one of them was iGEM. When I looked up 'Synthetic Biology,' I knew it was the field for me. It was a place where, in time, I could actually do DNA modification myself. Plus, the project they were working on sounded really neat; a microbial blood glucose sensor for diabetic patients. I went to the meeting and really felt welcomed by the team, unlike some other teams I visited. So I stuck around, visited the lab, talked to the workers, saw how much they cared about their work, and quickly fell in love with SynBio.""

The team members
Håkon Høgset
About
Half human and half machine, Håkon obviously has difficulties expressing his sense of humor. He is designed to handle advanced concepts of philosophy, mathematics and molecular biology, but not to remember where his keys are. Håkon is studying for a masters degree in molecular biology at the University of Oslo. He has grown up at Manglerud (suburbs) in Oslo, but despite of that he’s really doing ok. When he heard about IGEM he thought immediately that this was up his alley. Therefore he started recruiting people to the team in the student cafeteria.
Main contribution
I have contributed mostly to the lab work and the communication. I have worked on the idea and identified parts and systems we could use in our project. I have also held several presentations about iGEM and connected us with the press department at the MN-faculty. I have written applications for grants and raised travelling fundings from the Norwegian Biochemical Society. I participated on the Synthetic biology seminar in Trondheim and hold lectures on «Karrieredagen» and «Ungforsk». I worked most of the summer in the lab.
Fun fact
Has curls, and is actually a real human.
Promise
If we win the grand prize, I'm buying a big, fat gold ring that I'm gonna wear for the rest of my life.
William Brynildsen
About
I am a 25 year old master student in molecular biology and more particularly I am using bioinformatics on next-generation data to investigate the evolution of transposons in cod (not the video game). I am also intrigued by the field of synthetic biology and the possibilities that lies within. Beside all this school stuff I enjoy board games and playing the piano and the guitar and spending time with family and friends.
Main contribution
I have worked mostly on the lab, but also been part of the human practices, including the career day, ungforsk, lecture by Drew Endy in Trondheim, synthetic biology day and media stuff like the interview with Universitas. I have also blogged. I have created all the illustrations (using somersault1824.com package for raw images).
Fun fact
My dad was born in Africa.
Promise
If we win I will swim over the atlantic sea back home.
Vilde Olsson
About
I'm Vilde; 24 years old and currently taking my masters in plant genetics. I am passionate by (almost) everything in the field of molecular biology, so yes; a bit geeky. Outside the world of science I love downhill skiing, surfing and a good, cold beer (preferably accompanied by some good friends and snacks).
Main contribution
Discuss and come with ideas to the project. Plan and design the Lab work. Work full days in the lab during the summer. Troubleshooted and made an optimal protocol for cloning of the parts. Help in interviews with media. Writing on wiki. Holding presentation about iGEM and the project during a couple arrangements.
Fun fact
Is actually 2cm shorter than what her passport says, since she stood on her toes when they measured!
Promise
If we win I will spend a day hugging random people at the street - pretending to know them.
Sumaya Yusuf
About
I'm a 24 year old in my final year of the five year program in Pharmacy. I love learning about different subjects and for me pharmacy was the perfect of natural sciences mix. This interest is also why I joined the iGEM team. I like staying busy and having a lot to do. Which is why when I have a little spare time, I like to read even though I don’t always manage to finish reading a book I start on.
Main contribution
My main contribution in this project was working in the lab during the most summer and being the one of the main contacts to the Science Library. I’ve held presentations about iGEM, written several blogposts and written a couple of articles for the media. I've also written the ethics portion on our wiki.
Fun fact
I’ve done cosplaying before.
Promise
If we win I will scream something iGEM related from the top of my lungs,as loud as I possibly can from the highest point in Oslo. I.E. ""UiOSLO iGEM  freaking rulez!"" ...I’ll most likely have found a better sentence to scream by the time we’re in Boston.
Izadora Lorrany
About
I am 23 years old, brazilian and finishing my bachelor in biochemistry. I love science and have worked with Human Parasitology for 3 years. My dream is to become a researcher and contribute to society with my discoveries. I am passionate for my family (too emotive by the way), singing and brazilian food. In my free time I like to read, be with my friends and watch series.
Main contribution
I was part of the molecular biologists group and worked mainly with the project plan, progress and troubleshooting.
Fun fact
I used to practice gymnastics (yes, with somersaults! =D)
Promise
If we win I will give a short demonstration of my gymnastic skills in Giant Jamboree.
Stian Lågstad
About
I'm studying informatics for technical and scientific applications. That fits me well, as I've always been a huge computer geek. I'm interested in bioinformatics, so I'm planning to write my masters assigment with the biomedical informatics group at my university. When I'm not hammering away on my keyboard I can be found camping, playing football (soccer) or hanging out at my faculty's student society: Realistforeningen.
Main contribution
My main contribution to the project has been on the technical computing side. Creating the wiki, our blogs, social media sites and so on. I also had a little time in the lab - a cool, new experience for me. Other than that I've given presentations about IGEM and our project a couple of times.
Fun fact
Obsessed about the number 42.
Promise
If we win, I'm getting a synthetic biology tattoo.
Elina Melteig
About
I’m an extrovert, math-loving, partly nerdy person who believes that science makes the world a better place! I study bionanotechnology and in a years time I will finish my masters degree. When I don’t work on the iGEM-project I look for algae for my masters project. I love traveling and I’ve visited a lot of places. In addition I’ve taken a bachelor in Arabic, and I love learning other languages.
Main contribution
My main contribuition in this project was to get media attention to our project. I also actively had contact with the faculty for natural sciences in order to give presentations to students. I have also held several presentations, and written articles for the media. I've also helped out in the lab and tried to make N-term-his-tag. I learned a lot about lab work and then discovered that something was wrong with the primers. I've also written about human practices on our wiki. I've also done some administrative work concerning our travel.
Fun fact
I learned to swim before I could walk.
Promise
If we win the big prize I will face my fear and watch “The Black Sheep” alone. In the dark.
Supervisors
Dirk Linke
Associate Professor - Section for Genetics and Evolutionary Biology, Department for Biosciences, University of Oslo
My research group focusses on the structure and function of the bacterial cell surface.
Our work is typically comparative – we do not work on a single pathogenic “pet” organism, but instead compare related surface proteins from different species, studying their similarities and subtle differences. Our work is also interdisciplinary – we use methods from bioinformatics, structural biology and biophysics on top of classical methods from microbiology, molecular biology and biochemistry.

iGEM Team attributions page
Each team must clearly attribute work done by the student team members on this page.  The team must distinguish work done by the students from work done by others, including the host labs, advisors, instructors, and individuals not on the team roster.
Why do we have this requirement?
Attribution Template
We have this requirement to help the judges know what you did yourselves and what you had help with. We don't mind if you get help with difficult or complex techniques, just be sure to report the work your team did and the work that was done by others.
For example, you might choose to work with an animal model during your project. Working with animals requires getting a license and applying far in advance to conduct certain experiments in many countries. This is something that is difficult to achieve during the course of a summer, but much easier if you can work with a postdoc or PI who has the right licenses.
A great example of complete attribution comes from the Imperial College London 2011 team (scroll down to the bottom of their team page to see attributions).
Here are some of the fields we recommend you have on this page. If there are other areas not listed below, but applicable to your team/project, please feel free to also list them on your attributions page. Please feel free to remove any areas not applicable to your project.

Virtus Parva
The Power of Small
Who are we?
Virtus-Parva is a team of Nanotechnology students who aim to create a better world
through love,sympathy and endearment… and through the design and development
of a novel technology based on micrometric “drills”.
Students

Instructors
Meet the Team
Despite all of us being nanotechnologists, we are very different people with, of course, very different interests.Here are all of the team's members beautiful faces, with a short description to tell you a little bit about ourselves.So please, go ahead and get to know us!
Andrea Díaz Gaxiola
Passionate, extrovert, a multi-tasker, an always busy girl, my name is Andrea Díaz Gaxiola. Age: twenty two, and one year far from graduating from nanotechnology's bachelor.  I have found in Nanobiotech an amazing tool which I aim to use and develop in order to create novel therapeutics, and more effective drug delivery systems.
I am Virtus-Parva's Team leader, and the responsible for wanting to be a part of iGEM. It is a dream I shared with my friends, and we've all together made it possible.
My vision of the world involves all disciplines working together towards a deeper understanding of ourselves and what surrounds us, creating knowledge but never seeking for absolute truths.
Abraham Mauleon Amieva
Hi, my name is Abraham Mauleon Amieva. I'm twenty two, and I'm from the State of Puebla, Mexico. I'm studying the last semester of the degree in Nanotechnology and Molecular Engineering, at Universidad de las Américas Puebla (UDLAP). My personal interest in Nanobiotechnology is the research of novel complex materials. Hence my contribution within Virtus-Parva, for our 2014 iGEM project, was the idea of using biomaterials coupled with magnetic particles for the manufacture of biocompatible, magnetically controlled devices. Besides my scientific formation, I'm currently the President of the Civic Youth Council of Puebla; one of my main goals is the scientific diffusion among youth in the city.
Tania Hidalgo Castillo
Yo! I’m Tania Hidalgo, a kind-of-crazy vegetarian studying her 7th semester of the Nanotechnology and Molecular Engineering bachelor, even though people think I’m an Arts major. I’ve participated in research regarding the inorganic part of chemistry, so biotechnology and synthetic biology is a new field that I’m exploring with my teammates. I’m interested in using these to explore bioremediation and apply my chemist formation to deal with environmental issues. My love for science is shared with photography, stringed instruments, animals and beer.  The participation in the iGEM competition has granted me an opportunity to continue my learning experience and to collaborate with my friends to make something awesome (like our beautiful magnetite nanoparticles). I hope with this my family and friends finally know what I’m studying and what I’m passionate about.
Sabás Sánchez Tellechea
I’m Sabás Sánchez Tellechea, I’m 22 years old and I’m from Hermosillo, Sonora México. I’m a student of the 9th semester of the Nanotechnology and Molecular Engineering degree at the Universidad de las Américas Puebla (UDLAP). My involvement within the project isn’t limited to laboratory work, it extends to the genesis of the idea to use a resonant structure guided by a magnetic nanoparticle and the research to find biocompatible materials for the construction of the device. My interests in science and nanotechnology embraces the creation of new materials trying to solve the new needs of society, the efficient use of renewable energies and the pursuit of treatments for genetic syndromes.
Diego Rosas Villalva
As a nanotechnologist, I am fascinated by the way nanostructures can boost energy conversion and storage as well as bioremediation, but as a human I want to increase quality of life and access to information for people, leading me to participate in all kind of projects, giving the best of me. My name is Diego Rosas, I was born in the city of Puebla and I’m in my senior year of nanotechnology’s bachelor at Universidad de las Américas Pueba. I’ve participated in research regarding solar energy and photocatalysis. As a member of Virtus Parva I've synthesized the inorganic part of the project, now I am focused on bionanotechnology diffusion and mathematical modeling. Currently, I am starting a project on electrospun nanofibers for wound dressing, hoping to work in partnership with a local hospital.
Armando Morín Martínez
Hi! Enthusiast and always willing to lend a hand, My name is Armando, I currently am 22 years of age, and I’m native from the state of Coahuila, México. Studying the 9th semester of the nanotechnology and molecular engineering baccalaureate at the University of the Americas Puebla (UDLAP). Within the team I am envolved in the organization of Human Practices, as well as starring in the play Copenhage, interpreting the physicist Werner Heisenberg. My inclination towards synthetic biology lies in my growing interest towards the comprehension, mimicry, and incorporation of microscopic organic mechanisms that could be exploited by mankind. This in order to achieve a better adaptation into our ever changing Mother Nature without procuring harm to it and improving our quality of life.
Tamara Saitcevsky Parra
Hi! I’m Tamara, a slightly grumpy and always-in-the-mood-for-candy, 7th semester Nanotechnology and Molecular Engineering student at Universidad de las Américas Puebla. Among other things I love a good raspberry cheesecake, a gripping fantasy fiction book and a bright, sunny day.  Born and raised in Mexico City, my academic interests lie in molecular biology and the dissemination of science. Within my team I have been in charge of keeping a written record of our progress and to process this information in order to give back to our community. From this experience I have learned plenty on organization, teamwork and the importance of communication for even the smallest of tasks.
Instructors

We were daily in the microbiology lab, continuing with our experiment and consulting with him, in order to advance in our project on the correct path.
Dr. Miguel Angel Méndez Rojas: our instructor, supporter and main aid when it came to the inorganic portion of our project and kept our feet on the ground. Most of the time spent in this lab was towards the beginning of our project, for the synthesis of our magnetite.
Dr. Ruben Alejos Palomares: our instructor and biggest help when it came to modeling, without whom we would have been lost. Modelling was able to be completed thanks to the class Dr. Alejos taught, MEMS, and being widely available outside of classroom hours for consulting.

iGEM Team attributions page
Each team must clearly attribute work done by the student team members on this page.  The team must distinguish work done by the students from work done by others, including the host labs, advisors, instructors, and individuals not on the team roster.
Why do we have this requirement?
Attribution Template
We have this requirement to help the judges know what you did yourselves and what you had help with. We don't mind if you get help with difficult or complex techniques, just be sure to report the work your team did and the work that was done by others.
For example, you might choose to work with an animal model during your project. Working with animals requires getting a license and applying far in advance to conduct certain experiments in many countries. This is something that is difficult to achieve during the course of a summer, but much easier if you can work with a postdoc or PI who has the right licenses.
A great example of complete attribution comes from the Imperial College London 2011 team (scroll down to the bottom of their team page to see attributions).
Here are some of the fields we recommend you have on this page. If there are other areas not listed below, but applicable to your team/project, please feel free to also list them on your attributions page. Please feel free to remove any areas not applicable to your project.

All memebers of our team are students at Universidad de los Andes, they are involved in different areas of knowledge such as Science (Chemistry, Physics and Microbiology), Engineering and Medicine. Moreover, our team participants are from diferrent academic levels, between us you will find freshman, final year, and even graduate students. Each of us made important contributions in every part of our project (Laboratory, Mathematical Models and Human Practice).  You will find a complete profile of each member on the link: Member's page , in which you will be able to find the profile of our advisors Juan Manuel Pedraza and Silvia Restrepo, whose advice was of great importance for us.
Our laboratories
All our work was carried out on Biophysics Lab at Universidad de los Andes, a research lab BSL 2 which is directed (among others) by our advisor Juan Manuel Pedraza. We also used bacterial strains, reagents and equipment from Mycology and Plant Disease Laboratory at Universidad de los Andes (LAMFU), directed by our advisor Silvia Restrepo.   Often we received invaluable help and advice for other research laboratories, such as some reagents from the Laboratory of Organic Synthesis, Bio and Organocatalysis (Chemistry Department, Universidad de los Andes) or assistance in the using of fluorescence microscope by Optics Research Lab.  You can find all about safety on the Safety page .
Collaborations
This year we work with several teams! There is strength in numbers!
Our principal source of collaborations was Low Budget Lab iGEM Challenge .
In addition we collaborate with Paris Bettencourt team sending sweat samples. And with Dallas Team, talking of a possible common point in our projects, because both are focused on V. cholerae and it would be possible to join with them to create a super anti-cholerae tool: With our detection system and their attack system (based on phages).
The following table sums up the collaboration we made with other teams:

Mieszko Majka
I'm a sophomore student of chemistry & biotechnology at the College of Interfaculty Studies in  Mathematics  and  Natural  Sciences  (a.k.a.  Kolegium  MISMaP).  My  scientific  interests entail  biological  chemistry  (mostly  chemistry  of  nucleic  acids  and  proteins),  bits  of neurochemistry, molecular biology of nucleic acids and synthetic biology (mostly fantasizing how  to combine  fancy  natural  stuff  as  proteins,  RNAs,  etc.  into  systems  that  would  serve whatever purpose I have on  my  mind at the given time). Outside the lab, I do enjoy a good bike trip, some ballroom dancing or teaching people... whatever they want to learn and I can provide, so  it's usually English or chemistry. During this year's iGEM, I try to blow up the lab every other day (i.e. I'm a wetlab worker) but parallely, I help make sure that everything flows smoothly enough to prevent others from doing so (mostly by telling people  when to come to the lab and  when not & mundane stuff like this, really).

July
We had a meeting with SZU-China on 19th July just after deciding the project. They made a banner especially for us and gave us a warm welcome. We presented two projects in sequence and gave each other valuable suggestions.
It’s their first time to join in the whole iGEM family, so we then talked about the experience in establishing an iGEM team and doing project.
August
The Second Conference
We attended the 2nd iGEM Conference held by NCTU_Formosa. In the conference, every team had 20 minutes to present their projects and 10-minnute Q&A section. The professors and iGEMers present gave many suggestions to the team which was doing presentation. And we also had poster section to explain our projects to iGEMers who are interested face to face. We had a great time there and learned a lot from other teams. We developed deep friendship with other teams and kept in touch closely since then.
Meet up in SUSTC
SCUT and Shenzhen_SFLS (High School Division) came to SUSTC on 26th August. Everyone had an opportunity to introduce himself briefly. We did presentations and communicated a lot about team running. Then we showed them our lab and went for a short tour in our campus.
See SCUT wiki about this
September
XMU-China came to visit us on 17th September. We had a thorough evening talk about human practice and team running. We showed them our lab and our campus the day after.
See XMU-China wiki about this
October
We communicated with SJTU-Software about their software online. We consulted team members of SUSTC-ShenzhenB (Software team) last year, and gave them some suggestions.

iGEM Team attributions page
Each team must clearly attribute work done by the student team members on this page.  The team must distinguish work done by the students from work done by others, including the host labs, advisors, instructors, and individuals not on the team roster.
Why do we have this requirement?
Attribution Template
We have this requirement to help the judges know what you did yourselves and what you had help with. We don't mind if you get help with difficult or complex techniques, just be sure to report the work your team did and the work that was done by others.
For example, you might choose to work with an animal model during your project. Working with animals requires getting a license and applying far in advance to conduct certain experiments in many countries. This is something that is difficult to achieve during the course of a summer, but much easier if you can work with a postdoc or PI who has the right licenses.
A great example of complete attribution comes from the Imperial College London 2011 team (scroll down to the bottom of their team page to see attributions).
Here are some of the fields we recommend you have on this page. If there are other areas not listed below, but applicable to your team/project, please feel free to also list them on your attributions page. Please feel free to remove any areas not applicable to your project.

Yuta Kino (Team Leader)
School  of Biotechnology and Bioscience
Department  of Biotechnology
Course of Biological Information
I’m the leader of team Tokyo_Tech 2014. Why I decided to participate in iGEM is because, it is a precious opportunity for me to do research on our favorite themes with my teammates. To continue research in the future, I think it is necessary to turn my eyes not only to Japan but also to the world. I look forward to interchanging with students from foreign countries through iGEM.
 
 
Naoto Takahashi
School  of Biotechnology and Bioscience
Department  of Biotechnology
Course of Biomolecular Engineering
iGEM is a competition where students with various backgrounds from many countries gather to compete. In order to improve my English and expand my knowledge, I thought iGEM was the perfect opportunity. Being able to do this as an undergraduate is a valuable experience, so I will do my best and try to learn as much as I can from this competition.
 
 
 
Yuya Nakamura
School  of Biotechnology and Bioscience
Department  of Biotechnology
Course of Biological  Information
I decided to participate in iGEM because I thought it is a good opportunity to improve my ability and interchange with people from all over the world. Since I’m planning to enter graduate school and do research competing with other countries, so I think this challenge will be helpful for me.
 
 
 
Ayaka Murase
School  of Biotechnology and Bioscience
Department  of Biotechnology
Course of Bioengineering
I decided to take part in iGEM because this is a great opportunity to communicate with people from all over the world. An ordinary undergraduate do not have a chance like this, so I am very glad to attend this competition. I am planning to study abroad in graduate school, so I look forward to hearing a lot from students outside of Japan.
 
 
 
Shoko Suzuki
School  of Biotechnology and Bioscience
Department  of Biotechnology
Course of Biological  Information
iGEM was very attractive for me because it is an international contest and we can present in front of people from many countries. Also, being able to do a full-scale study before belonging to laboratories was very interesting to me. Through iGEM, I hope I can improve myself by doing my best.
 
 
 
Keina Matsumura
School  of Biotechnology and Bioscience
Department  of Biotechnology
Course of Biological  Information
I decided to participate in iGEM because we can do a research on a theme that we are interested in, which is a precious experience for undergraduates. I want to treasure the chances given in my university life, so when I heard about iGEM, I made up my mind to attend. I am sure that communicating with good students from all over the world will be a good stimulus for me.
 
 
 
Xinan Wang
School  of Biotechnology and Bioscience
Department  of Biotechnology
Course of Bioengineering
I am so glad that I have a chance to join this year’s iGEM competition. I think iGEM provides me a chance of both learning and self-improving. I hope that my journey with iGEMers will be the most meaningful and unforgettable experience in my university life. And it will also be a good experience for my further study in other foreign countries!
 
 
 
Kai Ye
School  of Science
Department of Mathematical and Computing Sciences
I’m glad to join this year’s iGEM competition. This experience must be valuable for me because there is almost no opportunity to compete with the world while we are students. Since I major in Mathematical and Computing Sciences, I wanted to contribute to the team by doing programming. I look forward to talking with many students from other countries at the Jamboree!
 
 
 
Paniti Achararit
School  of Engineering
Department of Information Engineering
I decided to participate in iGEM because it was a good opportunity for students from other major to study something out of their field. Although I am not familiar with biology, I wanted to contribute to the team by doing programming and constructing the website. I hope I can communicate with many people at the competition.
 
 
 
Takuya Kato
School  of Science
Department of Physics
Although I major in Physics, I am also interested in biology and decided to join iGEM. My role is carrying out modeling, which is very challenging for me, but I think it was a good experience. By the way, my hobby is to make “origami”, the historical culture of Japan. If you are interested in “origami”, please talk to me!
 
 
 
Riku Shinohara
School  of Biotechnology and Bioscience
Department  of Biotechnology
iGEM is a very precious opportunity for students not belonging  to laboratories to do a research. By attending iGEM, I would like to interact with students from all over the world and receive a lot of stimulation. I hope this experience becomes helpful in my future life as a researcher of biology.
 
 
 
Gyomon Ryu
School  of Biotechnology and Bioscience
Department  of Bioscience
This is the first time to go to America, so I feel very excited. I want all of you to talk to me, and I am looking forward to meeting and talking with other students who are studying biotechnology. By the way, I not only like researching but also doing outdoor sports. Let’s become good friends!
 
 
 
Kodai Hibi
School  of Biotechnology and Bioscience
Department  of Bioscience
When I was a freshman at Tokyo Tech, I belonged to a tennis club. Now that I am a sophomore, I think I should do something that I had never done in high school. So I joined this year’s iGEM. I will do my best preparing for the competition, and I hope this experience will be valuable to me in the future.
 
 
 
Miyabi Hishinuma
School  of Biotechnology and Bioscience
Department  of Bioscience
I choose to participate in iGEM because I want to create something new by ourselves other than just taking classes and submitting reports. I also wanted to complete a task by working in a team, so iGEM was the perfect opportunity for me. By communicating with students from all over the world, I hope I can expand my knowledge and use this experience in the future.

About the Team Members Advisors and Mentors Attributions Sponsors
The Team
We are a skillful and persistent group of nine Finns. We started as a group of students who didn't really know each other, assuming that we were going to spend our summer studying synthetic biology with strange colleagues. In the end we got a bunch of new friends and (in addition to studying synthetic biology) we just might have spent one of the best summers of our lives.
Our group is interdisciplinary and it comes from the University of Helsinki and Aalto University; the two big universities located in the capital of Finland, Helsinki. We have expertise in many different fields ranging from genetics to product development and from computer science to food technology. Throughout the project, we basically needed all of the special skills of each member to make our visions come true. The diverse set of skills made it possible to have a broad view on any problem.
There were also moments when we noticed that no one in our team fits a specific task perfectly but we always took it as a possibility to learn something new and there was always someone up for a challenge! While everyone mostly got to do things they enjoyed the most and were good at already, all of us learned a lot during this project - about all kinds of things.
So, even while the team was divided to different subgroups who would focus on a certain part of the project, everyone got the chance to experience and learn something that they had never done before. Being a part of this team has been an amazing opportunity. It's difficult to imagine life without being in this team: how is it possible that we didn't even know each other a year ago?
While we all worked intensely on the project, we wouldn't be here without the amazing support that we received!
Here's the link to our Official Team Profile .
From left to right: Niklas Itänen, Laura Laakso, Lassi Vapaakallio, Otto Lamminpää, Oskari Vinko, Martina Ikonen, Mikko Laine, Minttu Salmela, Pietu Roisko.
Team Members
While it was possible for every member to take part in everything, there were some focus areas for every person in the team.
Leading the Team: Oskari made sure that everything that needed to be done would get done. While he didn't always have to do this alone, the importance of proper leadership isn't questionable! Oskari also founded the team and recruited the members.
Business: Pietu, Niklas, Otto and Oskari took part in Summer of Startups and brought the entrepreunial views to the team. Pietu is our main pitcher and Niklas and Otto focused on creating the business plan.
Research: The background research, designing our genetically engineered machine and the bioinformatics was mostly done by Oskari, Lassi and Laura.
Lab: Minttu and Martina spent the summer in the lab playing with bacteria and BioBricks.
Modeling: Niklas and Otto are our modeling agency . They took care of both the mathematical modeling and the business model. Oskari participated in their work by giving comments and suggestions.
Simulation: Otto and Niklas took care of the computing whereas Oskari created the user interface for the python script and web based simulation. Lassi ported the computational parts into JavaScript for the web simulation.
Software: Lassi was in charge of the software development, created the Seekers and taught everyone to use GitHub. Most of the team members programmed something, but Lassi was usually the first person who you'd go to when your code didn't work. Pietu programmed and built the LED rig and Laura worked with the web pages.
Wiki: Laura designed the looks and the structure of the wiki, Lassi implemented the core of the wiki, Pietu made the wiki upload tool and Oskari scripted a neat way to refer to figures in the research section. All of us contributed to the content.
Media: Mikko did a wide range of things to hype us in the media, created and constantly updated our social media sites and wrote a big story for Kemia magazine.
Visual Appearance: Laura took care of the visual appearance, often asking opinions from the other team members. This included e.g. our logo, web/wiki page layouts, poster, team banner and illustrations of lambda repressor. Minttu made the gene circuit and lamp pictures and took many photos of the lab.
As already mentioned, we didn't always follow this categorization. Lassi and Otto, ""the competent boys"" (Finnish version: ""komppipojat"" ) e.g. made competent cells in the lab a couple of times, Niklas made sure that that the layout of the modeling page on the wiki was perfect, Minttu and Laura held a presentation even though they were the most uncomfortable presenting anything in front of a crowd and Pietu designed the layouts for our business cards and the pitch deck for SoS Demo Day, and also photographed the team! Mikko tried out pitching on our trip to Tallinn!
Oskari Vinko
Captain
Aalto University
University of Helsinki
I’m a synthetic biology enthusiast with a mathematical background and crazy ideas. I’m definitely an optimist so often I need somebody to keep my feet on the ground. I’m very curious and one of the best entertainment is to find out how everything works. I also love to code but lately, I haven’t had too much time for that. In fall 2014 I started my Master’s studies in Biotechnology at ETH Zürich and I’m majoring in Synthetic Biology.
In 2013 I heard about iGEM and I knew immediately that I want to participate in it. I took an initiative to found the first-ever Finnish iGEM team and thus, I ended up being the team captain. This means I’m the jack-of-all-trades trying to peek my nose to everything but I’m not really getting things done. I’ve been writing tons of emails, funding applications and developed new ideas but pretty much all the credit of implementing them goes to the rest of our awesome team.
I used to play piano and frisbeegolf, do scouting and go cycling. Since I moved to Switzerland (this odd country with a weird set of languages not familiar to me) I’ve tried to enjoy cycling as much as possible because those other hobbies do not really work out here. After iGEM I’m going to look forward to try something new and get involved in new projects. And I already miss sauna and rye bread!
Minttu Salmela
Lab Rat
Aalto University
A fourth-year Chemical Engineering student majoring in Bio and Food Technology.
I am the second half of our lab team and I have been in charge of the wet lab with Martina. I have spent most of my days in the lab working with Biobricks and our dear bacteria.                 I am also the Travel Manager of our team so I have been responsible for all the things related to the Boston trip.
In the beginning of the summer I knew barely anything about gene technology, let alone synthetic biology, so it has been amazing to learn a whole bunch of new things and actually getting to do stuff in the lab on our own.
One highlight of my summer was when we got our first sequencing results and we finally had concrete proof that we had actually managed to ligate pieces of DNA together. Before that we just had to have faith in ourselves and hope things were going the right way. Now I know why some people say that science is like a religion!
Music, puppies, travelling, a good cup of tea and sleeping in on a Sunday morning are my favourite things in the world.
Laura Laakso
Designer
University of Helsinki
I’m a fourth-year student majoring in Molecular Biosciences and minoring in Computer Science. I’m also interested in art and design. In our iGEM team my main responsibility has been designing things; both the genetic switch and our own visual appearance.
I’d have the required skills to work in the laboratory, too, but I ended up spending most of the summer either researching, drawing or coding. I learned a lot about designing genetic mechanisms and also an enormous amount of CSS tricks. It was amazing to see that it was actually possible to do all the things that interest me for the same project, even though they seem so far apart at first.
Sometimes I entirely lose the sense of time and place while focusing on something interesting. I might fixate on a drawing, a game, a problem, or even studying, and completely forget everything else for a while. This is often useful, but sometimes also troublesome.
Lassi Vapaakallio
Cool Title
University of Helsinki
A third-year Computer Science student with 2 years of Biotech background.
My main responsibility was programming various software tools to help research and lab work, as well as developing our website and wiki. I also racked up a surprising amount of lab hours considering the last time I worked in the lab was 3 years ago.
I also did a bunch of bioinformatics. I found myself playing around with Geneious a lot, making primers, analysing sequencing results and building things virtually before we assembled them in the lab.
The coolest thing during the summer was making the BioBrick Seeker and seeing what can be achieved by a group of students in a field that we barely knew anything about.
Random fun fact: I’m the 36th best pinball player in Finland.
I’m kind of a huge game enthusiast. I love spending time with people playing games, whether it’s card games, board games, pinball, table-top RPGs or any kinds of computer games.
I also play all sorts of drums.
Pietu Roisko
Pitcher
Aalto University
I am a third-year student in the School of Electrical Engineering. I’m majoring in Bionics, i.e. combining engineering with existing biological systems. Measuring electrical signals in the human body is one of my key interests.
My contribution to the team was more on the entrepreneurial side as biochemistry is not my field of study. I really enjoyed taking our work to the public via the Summer of Startups program. I worked much on the presentations we held, and did quite a lot of pitching too.
Later in the summer I researched and built the LED rig we used to perform our measurements. I really enjoy building things. I enjoy coding too, but ended up programming very little, because we have so many great coders in our team.
I did learn a whole lot of gene technology and lab-work on the side too. This was a really awesome project to be part of and I can assure that interdisciplinarity really took us far.
Keep it simple. I enjoy photography, building things, programming and entrepreneurship.
Martina Ikonen
BioBrick Master
Aalto University
I’m a Bachelor of Science (technology) in Chemical Engineering. This is my fourth year and I’m starting Master’s studies majoring in Bio and Food Technology at Aalto University.
I have spent the summer mostly in the lab and made loads of gel runs, ligations and transformations, that is, the cloning. My special skill is knowing the Biobricks well as I had already had an introduction to them when making my Bachelor’s thesis last spring. So I knew the principles of the assembly techniques although I had never done any gene technology lab work before.
During the work with my thesis I regretted I would never know if Biobricks are useful in reality. The stroke of luck came in the form of an announcement to build the first-ever Finnish iGEM team. In theory, Biobricks sounded like a cool way of making genetic engineering easier but now I really got an opportunity to do some hands-on work with Biobricks!
In my official hobbies I would include synchronized skating and scouting which both I have been into since I was a kid. In addition, I like knitting, spending time outside in the nature and geocaching. I'm certainly going to find some geocaches in Boston, too!
Otto Lamminpää
Mathematical Modeling Agent
University of Helsinki
A third-year Mathematics and Theoretical Physics student in University of Helsinki with an additional year of experience in Chemistry from University of Turku. With my colleague Mr. Itänen, I shared the responsibility of designing and creating both mathematical and business models for our project. I also did programming for our simulation, worked in the lab making electrocompetent cells and participated in the Summer of Startups.
Although you can often find me lost in thought, I’m generally quite outgoing and spend most of my time discussing recent topics with my colleagues and sampling fine brews, such as coffees and ales.
Niklas Itänen
Mathematical Supermodel
University of Helsinki
A third-year Mathematics and Theoretical Physics student in University of Helsinki.
My main responsibilities were to create a mathematical model with my colleague Otto Lamminpää, as well as to participate in the Summer of Startups incubator programme. I was also responsible for designing and writing our Business Plan with Mr. Lamminpää. Before the summer I had no previous experience in molecular biology and I have really learned a lot, cheers!
During the summer, me and Mr. Lamminpää ended up using most of our spare time walking around the city discussing mathematics and mysteries of life itself.
Mikko Laine
Media Guru
Aalto University
I'm a fifth-year Bachelor of Science (Technology) in Chemical Engineering. I major in Bioprocess Technology and minor in Economy.
In this project I’ve been in charge of the communications. My main task has been stirring a bustle in the media; both traditional and social. My job has included updating Facebook, Twitter, Flickr and Youtube accounts and writing a blog on our website. I’ve also been contacting Finnish press and written a few stories in relevant magazines.
My interests cover a wide area of different fields; from biochemistry and gene technology to communications and influencing. I have also given the team members tips in performance, since I have quite a lot performing experience. Likewise the other members, I have also been a little bit all over the place, sometimes working in laboratory and sometimes attending the Summer of Startups program. I also wrote, directed and produced our teaser video to Demo Day.
The summer has been a fantastic experience! Learning about gene circuits and BioBricks has been very interesting, but also taking a sneak peek in communication on the field has been educational.
I have a wide range of hobbies; theatre, singing, dancing and writing are just a few to mention. I’m also involved in student associations. I rarely just stand still!
Random fun fact: I host a kids’ tv channel in Finland
Advisors and Mentors

Help with the Business View
Summer of Startups
In the Summer of Startups incubator programme, we met many people giving us advice in form of talks and one-on-one discussion sessions. We also received a 5000€ grant from Aalto Entrepreneurship Society (AaltoES) which is the organizer of the SoS programme. This year, Panu Paljakka and Ville Riola were taking care of the practicalities during the summer.
We want to thank Aape Pohjanvirta, Ville Miettinen, Moaffak Ahmed, Miia Bovellan, Erkki Tenhunen, Mike Bradshaw and Micki Honkavaara for all the coaching, business insights, feedback, pitching advice, inspiration and encouragement.
Biotech Start-Up Management (BSUM)
We met Jari Rautio and and Juhani Lahdenperä from Biotech Start-Up Management (BSUM), thanks to Miia Bovellan. They have been very supporting but also pushing us forward to get connected with university intellectual property right experts and potential pilot customers. We have received very high quality feedback on our business plan which has helped us to learn and make it better through multiple iterations. BSUM has been of great help in realizing our priorities and opportunities. They have become our mentors with commercial aspect. In return, we have promised to redesign their company website.
People in the Lab
Sanni Voutilainen, Ph.D., Aalto University
During the last month before the Giant Jamboree, Sanni helped us with some clonings that we couldn’t get to work and as we were already busy with school courses. She also helped us with any urgent issues we had, such as figuring out how to send out our BioBricks.
Georg Schmidt, Ph.D., Aalto University
Georg with his expertise in electroporations, ligations and PCRs, has given us many tips on what sort of things need to be taken into consideration in the lab and how to improve the success rate in our cloning etc. We had many debugging sessions with him when our protocols didn’t work.

Dairy and beef production are important to our daily lives and consumption needs. However, there are serious climate change issues regarding the continual expansion of these industries. The microbiota inside the cow’s rumen releases dangerous amounts of greenhouse gases as they help digest the animal's food. Therefore, finding ways to decrease the production of greenhouse gases of dairy cows and cattle is essential in fighting global warming.
In this year’s iGEM project we fight global warming right at its source - the cows rumen. Using the powerful tools of synthetic biology we were able to reduce the methane levels through a genetically engineered E. coli.

Our Team
Dr. Torsten Meyer
Age: 35
Occupation: Advisor
Why I take part in the iGEM competition:
As a research fellow at the institute of biochemistry, biotechnology and bioinformatics I am usually in charge of research projects in the field of antibody selection. The work and mentoring for this years iGEM team is an interesting diversion from the daily routine in the lab. It´s a lot of fun to work out an ambitious project with highly motivated students and help them with words and deeds in the lab. Particularly the combination of students from all semesters renders the work especially interesting.
Nils Birkholz
Age: 24
Occupation: Bachelor student of Biology
Why I take part in the iGEM competition:
In contrast to the routine I am used to in the course of my curriculum where I am mostly exposed to established experiments with forseeable results, iGEM offers the possibility to plan and carry out an own research project with a team –including all the accompaniments and imponderabilities. Thus, by being part of this year’s iGEM team, I expect to get a taste of the thrill hopefully awaiting me in my future work life.
Rüdiger Frederik Busche
Age: 19
Occupation: Bachelor student of Biology
Why I take part in the iGEM competition:
Synthetic biology is a fascinating field which has intrigued me for a long time and which I am considering as a possible future occupation. Furthermore, iGEM offers great opportunities into broaden my horizon beyond factual academic learning and to get to know other students with whom I can share my ideas and interest in biology and biotechnology.
Oliver Konzock
Age: 23
Occupation: Bachelor student of Biotechnology
Why I take part in the iGEM competition:
Apart from the various experiences you can gain in the field of project planning and applied science, I am especially looking forward to meeting iGEM teams and their projects from all over the world at the Giant Jamboree. What impresses me most about iGEM is to see that nearly every problem can be solved with the help of synthetic biology.
Steffen Lippold
Age: 22
Occupation: Bachelor student of Biology
Why I take part in the iGEM competition:
The competition offers a unique opportunity to both apply and enlarge the knowledge already gained in biosciences in an interdisciplinary project. Apart from the experimental challenge, the collaboration with scientifically dedicated students is a main aspect of my motivation.
Carsten Ludwig
Age: 22
Occupation: Bachelor student of Biotechnology
Why I take part in the iGEM competition:
Although the daily routine of academic studies facilitates some practical experiences as a student I am bound to the strictly arranged practicals. Under the conditions of the iGEM competition I hope to gain more practical knowledge which exceeds the “standard university knowledge” and which is distinctly closer to actual research. Furthermore I´m excited to work with ambitious colleagues and realize an entire project in all its facets (development, funding, conversion and presentation) and discuss and exchange about all that with students from around the world.
Melanie Philippi
Age: 21
Occupation: Bachelor student of Biotechnology
Why I take part in the iGEM competition:
iGEM gives you the opportunity to create your own ideas and to put them into a great project. To try out  so much by yourself together with such a great team is simply awesome!
Lukas Platz
Age: 19
Occupation: Bachelor student of Biology
Why I take part in the iGEM competition:
At first I was really skeptical about the iGEM program because as a first semester there are so many new things to learn and to think about. However I decided to learn more about iGEM and on our first briefing I was so impressed about the engagement and courage of the members of last year´s team that I decided to join. Furthermore, there was also another aspect which guided me to the iGEM-Team. It was the idea of being creative, meeting new people and learning about synthetic biology all at once.
Christian Sigismund
Age: 35
Occupation: Bachelor student of Biology
Why I take part in the iGEM competition:
iGEM offers me the opportunity to test and expand my knowledge and experiences in bioscience. Therefore, I look forward to working on a self-organized research project with other motivated students parallel to studies. The cooperation in a team to work out a suitable project, the work in the wet lab and finally the presentation of our results allows a realistic look into the daily routine of scientific research.
Maren Wehrs
Age: 23
Occupation: Master student of Biotechnology
Why I take part in the iGEM competition:
This competition provides the opportunity to develop an own idea from the very beginning in a young, diverse team. One has to come up with a finance plan, the implementation and finally the presentation. I think that we’ll have a lot of fun working on our project and especially on exchanging experiences with other teams.
Niels Werchau
Age: 24
Occupation: Bachelor student of Biology
Why I take part in the iGEM competition:
iGEM offers the possibility to apply the academic knowledge gained during our studies. Besides the knowledge in science the competition demands social commitment. This interdisciplinary approach in combination with the competetive situation renders the participation very attractive.
Anna Wronska
Age: 21
Occupation: Bachelor student of Biotechnology
Why I take part in the iGEM competition:
Last year, I already participated in the iGEM competition and I had so much fun. Working in a self-organized team having other motivated students with innovative ideas, leads to many intense discussions. However, one of  the greatest springs of joy in teamwork like this and the reason for participating again is the time we spend together laughing.
Zen-Zen Yen
Age: 24
Occupation: Master student of Biotechnology
Why I take part in the iGEM competition:
Having been on exchange to the University of Waterloo, I learned how important it is to have own ideas and to talk about the realization of those. Hence, I believe the IGEM competition gives us science students not only the opportunity to do so, but moreover allows us to get in contact with other people who are on the same page. By being part of an IGEM team I hope that I’ll gain some knowledge, get to know other science junkies and make some amazing experiences.

Collaborations
Collaborations with institutions or other iGEM Teams promote exchange of experiences and know-how and lead to a benefit for both sides. Therefore, we got in contact with two local research institutions. They supported us with advice, materials and helpful methods for our experiments. One of the supporters was the Thünen Institute in Braunschweig with a research focus on the economy, ecology and technologies of rural regions, seas and forests. Dr. Ulf Prüße, an expert for renewables conversion technology, gave us professional advice for our experiments with the immobolization of E. cowli. Furthermore, we received lots of material from the institute and had the possibility to measure the methane degradation at their gas chromatograph with a thermal conductivity detector.
An important part of the iGEM competition is the cooperation between the teams. In order to get in contact with other iGEM Teams from Germany, we joined the iGEM meet-ups in Munich and Aachen. We numerously represented the iGEM Team Braunschweig at both events and drew attention to our this year’s project. We used these opportunities to give presentations and obtained encouraging feedback and helpful ideas during the follow-up discussions. At the Munich meet-up we made contact with the iGEM teams from Aachen and Hanover, followed by some nice barbecue evenings with Team Hanover. We also met a few iGEMers from Aachen at the “Maker Faire” in Hanover and spent the day together. Team Aachen provided us with a self-engineered methane sensor which we would later put to good use in our experiments. Such collaborations were strengthened at the second meet-up which was held in Aachen in September. However, we did not only get in contact with teams nearby, but also with teams overseas. We had a skype video chat with the iGEM Team Waterloo and discussed our projects, and exchanged our experiences concerning the competition.
The iGEM Team from Virginia created a survey about synthetic biology which was also to be conducted by teams from other parts of the world. Therefore, we translated the survey into German and conducted it at our university’s open house. The survey dealt with the public awareness towards and acceptance of synthetic biology and the aim was to get an impression of how people from all ages, origins and professions think about this. We do not know the results yet, but we still hope we could make a contribution for this survey to become more representative with regard to the control sample.

Overview
Several months of brainstorming, discussions and literature search as well as meetings with different faculty members from the Technical University of Denmark resulted in a joint decision on working on the Spinach project. The initial idea about measuring promoter activities in absolute terms originates from one of our team members, Kristian Jensen, and Chris Workman hinted us about the Spinach concept. The obvious applicability of the project and huge potential has been a main driving force for all of us during the project.
The formation of our team was facilitated by Chris Workman, but the project management, planning, fundraising as well as the designs, work described on this wiki, our results and the submitted BioBricks were done by ourselves. Nevertheless, we owe  thanks to several people for constructive feedback, advice, guidance and for encouraging our work as well as for providing us space in their laboratories.
Students
Initially we divided the team into different subgroups created with regard to our competences at the time of our competence session and personal intentions for gaining new skills. Due to this subdivision, the contributions of each member is greatly reflected by the subgroups each of us has participated in during the project. The members of the different subgroups are as follows:
Laboratory
- Kristian Jensen
- Rasmus Bech
- Kristian Barrett
- Caroline Mosbech
- Anne Pihl Bali
- Anne Sofie Lærke Hansen
Policy & Practice

A couple of students who were part of the initial phase of the project should receive a special thanks.
Anders Bech Bruntse, was of great help in proofreading funding applications resulting in full financing of our project and trip to Boston.
Casper Nørskov Enghuus, took part in the initial fundraising process and also took part in the initial lab phase.
Georgi Dimitrov created the spinach iGEM logo.
Advisors
Our advisors have advised us and provided constructive feedback as well as professional discussions, when this was needed and we owe every one of them thanks.
Especially we owe Kristian Davidsen thanks for his practical help during the project. Kristian has provided both ‘emergency’ lab  help and tips and tricks for PCR. Furthermore Kristian was of great help during our BioBrick workshop.
Hilde Coumou has helped in the initial phase of our Policy & Practice work. She has introduced us to different communication strategies and how to optimise science communication, which has helped us in defining a strategy for streamlining our outreach initiatives as well as choosing our target group.
Helen Cook helped us set up the BioBrick workshop and has kindly answered all kinds of immediate questions throughout the project period.
In addition to helping us with the scientific aspects of our project and the experimental planning, Jan Martinussen and Mogens Kilstrup have opened up their lab to us so we could use their equipment for measuring fluorescence.
Ali Altintas has helped us throughout our experimental work with the BioLector, as well as with interpreting our results throughout the project. Furthermore Ali gave us the initial safety introduction to the laboratory.
Anne Egholm Pedersen has introduced us to fluorometry and helped with our flow cytometry measurements.
Acknowledgements
We are very thankful for the help and guidance that we have received from other faculty members than our own supervisors, such as
Sébastien Muller, for advice on work with in vitro transcription.
Martin Kogle provided us with competent E. coli DH5α.
Regina Schürmann, for helping out with laboratory facilities during the BioBrick workshop.
Marzanna Pulka-Amin, for materials in the laboratory
Marlene Dalgaard, for advice and materials for in vitro transcription.
Other iGEM Teams
During the summer an ethic workshop was hosted by the University of Copenhagen iGEM team , the outcome of the workshop can be seen here , and we are very grateful to have been invited.
Laboratories
Most of our experiments were carried out at Center for Biological Sequence Analysis (CBS) at DTU Systems Biology located at the Technical University of Denmark. Here we were invited to use their machines to perform our molecular work and measurements.
Part of the work was carried out at Metabolic Signaling and Regulation and Infection Microbiology at DTU Systems Biology. Here we used the fluorescence microscope and fluorometer to investigate our cultures, which was a great help during the project and we used the flow cytometer to measure fluorescence at cellular level.
Literature
Dr. Samie Jaffrey from Department of Pharmacology, Weill Medical College, Cornell University, was of great help, and provided us the specific sequences of their Spinach-construct which later on made the foundation for our quantification of promoter strengths.

I've just finished the first year of my Systems Biology MSc at DTU.  In a nutshell, this means I write code to study biologically relevant patterns in genomic information, and I make predictions that can be tested experimentally.   I joined the iGEM team because my concept of 'fun' includes dedicating my summer to work on a big project with other committed people.  Synthetic biology can be used to build a more sustainable future for us and our planet, and I'm excited to be a part of a team that is making that happen. Also, I am quite fond of chocolate cake.

Team Profile
The DTU iGEM team 2014 is an ambitious team consisting of 11 graduate students, five advisors and three main supervisors with a total of seven different nationalities. We share a deep interest in chemistry, biology and biotechnology and work dedicatedly in the cross-disciplinary environment of iGEM. Our group possesses a unique combination of valuable competences, comprising skills in molecular biology, biochemistry, mathematical modelling, scientific programming, project management, entrepreneurship as well as scientific and non-scientific communication. Combined our team has a keen interest in state-of-the-art biotechnology and is eager to contribute to the field of synthetic biology.
Fun is fundamental. There is no way around it. You absolutely must have fun. Without fun, there is no enthusiasm. Without enthusiasm, there is no energy. Without energy, there are only shades of gray.
- Doug Hall
To create and maintain a dynamic group and enjoyable working atmosphere as well as to keep up our enthusiasm when sitting inside a laboratory when getting snap-chatted by friends on the beach, we of course also went out sunbathing and swimming, enjoyed some cold beers, traditional Danish dinners, and delicious ice creams during the summer.

Meet the team
The 2014 DTU iGEM team is an ambitious team consisting of eight graduate students, four advisors and three main supervisors with a total of five different nationalities. We share a deep interest in chemistry, biotechnology and synthetic biology and work dedicatedly in the cross-disciplinary environment of iGEM. Our group possesses a useful combination of valuable competences, comprising skills in molecular biology, biochemistry, mathematical modelling, scientific programming, project management, entrepreneurship as well as scientific and non-scientific communication. Combined our team has a keen interest in state-of-the-art biotechnology and is eager to contribute to the field of synthetic biology.

Team Members
Anne Pihl Bali
Motivation
I had several reasons for joining the DTU iGEM team. I wanted to follow all aspects of a project - from the idea generation to the experimental work as well as the communication and management involved in a big scientific project with several participants. Furthermore I wanted to improve my team working skills and challenge myself.
Major contributions
Meeting coordinator and streak purification master.
How do you prefer spinach?
Fresh spinach leaves as the main component in a salad together with feta cheese, red pepper and a nice oil-based dressing.
Linkedin Profile
Anne Sofie Lærke Hansen
Motivation
I joined our team to experience how to manage a scientific project from the very beginning and to the end, to improve my team working skills as well as to work with some crazy science. Of course being shielded from the burning sun by spending most of my waking hours in front of a lab bench during the summer also kept me working on the project.
Major contributions
Coordination of the fundraising and sponsorships as well as maintaining a sterile environment in the lab.
How do you prefer spinach?
Try frozen spinach on a pizza with onion, bacon, goat cheese and a lot of garlic - that is delicious.
Linkedin Profile
Caroline Mosbech
Motivation
My great interest in synthetic biology is one of the main reasons why I’m participating in iGEM. The great thing about synthetic biology is that we are not only examining and observing nature, but applying it in new contexts. This together with the the fact that it is a field experiencing rapid development and has a huge future potential.  iGEM is a unique opportunity for me to be a part of an ambitious team and to develop a project from absolute scratch to final jamboree. It is amazing how different iGEM projects are and I’m looking forward to seeing this year's contributions.
Major contributions
First of all movie star, but maybe more importantly responsible for preventing the autoclave from exploding.
How do you prefer spinach?
Spinach is a great color supplement to traditional Danish food often kept in different shades of brown.
Linkedin Profile
Kristian Barrett
Motivation
As a child I had a dream about studying biotechnology and being able to grow living houses from seeds. As I got older I realized that biology is much more complex than I could ever imagine. I have also always had a great interest within electronics and I like to build circuits to solve a problem. When I heard about iGEM, I immediately know that this was a fusion between two of my greatest interests. In a far future I hope that biological components are so well described that we will be able to program a cell to perform complex functions like growing a wooden living treehouse.
Major contributions
Making sure the DFHBI is stored properly and lighting up the bunsen burner.
How do you prefer spinach?
I prefer my Spinach fluorescent in the lab, bound to DFHBI forming a fluorophore.
Linkedin Profile
Kristian Jensen
Motivation
I am very interested in synthetic biology, so joining the university’s iGEM team seemed like an obvious choice. I am excited about the prospect of completing our own research project and hopefully contributing to the synthetic biology community.
Major contributions
Nanodropping like it's hot.
How do you prefer spinach?
Juiced - with a dash of vodka (or two).
Linkedin Profile
Mark Thomas Østerlund
Motivation
I have a deep fascination with the possibilities of synthetic biology. The fact that we are now capable of tailoring organisms to fit our specific needs is just astonishing! Besides it’s a great opportunity to pick up some new skills relevant to working in a different kind of group.
Major contributions
Wiki.
How do you prefer spinach?
In a salmon-spinach pie.
Linkedin Profile
Rasmus Bech
Motivation
I joined iGEM in order to take part in a project where the students have more control and responsibility than other projects at DTU. It was also a motivation being part of a team, as large projects at DTU most often are individual.
Major contributions
Diluting things correctly.
How do you prefer spinach?
I prefer spinach in a salad with strawberry, red onion, pine nuts, feta and a dressing with Balsamico vinegar, oil, sugar, soy sauce and tabasco.
Linkedin Profile
Thor Bech Johannesen
Motivation
As a student at DTU you get to do plenty of project work, however it is mostly carried out individually or in a small group, with very specific goals and a high degree of supervision. iGEM offers the opportunity to work on a much larger project with a high degree of autonomy, where everything from the overall goals and strategy to design of experiments is left for the students to manage. This provides a great opportunity to experience the challenges of actual research projects
Major contributions
Wiki.
How do you prefer spinach?
Luminescent and far away from my taste buds.
Linkedin Profile

iGEM Team attributions page
Each team must clearly attribute work done by the student team members on this page.  The team must distinguish work done by the students from work done by others, including the host labs, advisors, instructors, and individuals not on the team roster.
Why do we have this requirement?
Attribution Template
We have this requirement to help the judges know what you did yourselves and what you had help with. We don't mind if you get help with difficult or complex techniques, just be sure to report the work your team did and the work that was done by others.
For example, you might choose to work with an animal model during your project. Working with animals requires getting a license and applying far in advance to conduct certain experiments in many countries. This is something that is difficult to achieve during the course of a summer, but much easier if you can work with a postdoc or PI who has the right licenses.
A great example of complete attribution comes from the Imperial College London 2011 team (scroll down to the bottom of their team page to see attributions).
Here are some of the fields we recommend you have on this page. If there are other areas not listed below, but applicable to your team/project, please feel free to also list them on your attributions page. Please feel free to remove any areas not applicable to your project.
General Support
Project support and advice
Fundraising help and advice
Lab support
Difficult technique support
Project advisor support
Wiki support
Presentation coaching
Policy & Practices support
Thanks and acknowledgements for all other people involved in helping make a successful iGEM team.

Biology and chemistry are my biggest interest and also a sort of hobby to me so I chose to study biotechnology because of the mix of the two. I joined the DTU iGEM team to learn synthetic biology and to get the experience of doing it. I also like the idea that you can go into the lab and create something that has never been made before. When I’m not doing school work I enjoy watching sports like football, handball and boxing but road cycling beats them all. My favorite cake is banana cake with big chunks of chocolate.

For example, you might choose to work with an animal model during your project. Working with animals requires getting a license and applying far in advance to conduct certain experiments in many countries. This is something that is difficult to achieve during the course of a summer, but much easier if you can work with a postdoc or PI who has the right licenses.
A great example of complete attribution comes from the Imperial College London 2011 team (scroll down to the bottom of their team page to see attributions).
Here are some of the fields we recommend you have on this page. If there are other areas not listed below, but applicable to your team/project, please feel free to also list them on your attributions page. Please feel free to remove any areas not applicable to your project.

Our Team
Sierra Tackett
I am a junior Biochemistry major at Wisconsin Lutheran College. I have been involved in iGEM since 2013. I began as a laboratory technician and summer camp group leader. This year, I have directed the team with our overall project and summer camp. I coordinated speakers, activities, and housing for our camp students. I have worked to oversee all aspects of the project to ensure completion including lab work, our survey, human practices research, website, and data modeling. I have also learned a great deal about securing funding for scientific research. This has been a challenging yet rewarding leadership experience for me, and I look forward to applying what I have learned to a career as an MD or MD/PhD.
Christa Winslow
I am junior at WLC majoring in biochemistry. I am excited to be a part of iGem because it represents the ingenuity and collaboration of young scientists to actually create projects with real world applications. It is a great opportunity to really own a project outside of class and it has challenged me to become more competent in the lab and grow in my knowledge of biology in general. This year I was active in lab work, background research, the summer camp, poster design, and the presentation for our project. In addition to iGEM-related work, I have participated in coral reef research in Grenada and research on maize gametophyte development at WLC. I hope to end up doing genetic research or working for a biotechnology company developing GM products with medical applications.
​When not working in the lab (let’s be real; this is a rare occurrence) I may be found at track practice running hurdles, sketching wildlife, reading a recent fictional novel, SCUBA diving, or catching a movie with my friends.
Anna Razr Garvey
I am a Junior Biochemistry student at Wisconsin Lutheran College. As one of the Lab Managers for the iGEM team, my responsibilities included dividing up lab work, designing primers, and overseeing the lab technicians and their progress. My main role was spending countless hours in the lab and preforming a never ending set of experiments that moved our project forward. Though the process seemed unending, these hours were my favorite part of my experience with iGEM. Not only did I get to greatly expand my practical knowledge of laboratory techniques, but I also solidified my choice in attending graduate school and obtaining my PhD.
Beyond direct lab work, I lead the committee that designed and filled the presentation poster, and was one of two lab directors for the Synthetic Biology Summer Camp. The responsibilities included prepping and instructing the lab portion of the curriculum, and reinforcing concepts taught earlier in the camp. We were also given time to get to know the students outside of the lab, which was quite enlightening. Teaching these students, and watching their opinion of science change was a very inspiring and exciting experience for me. I mean, leaving an impact is the whole goal, right?
When I am not in lab, working, or doing homework I enjoy reading a vast array of books, sitting in coffee shops, thinking about life, and occasionally writing. Ultimately, I hope to publish a book one day. In the near future, I plan on attending graduate school to obtain my PhD. Honestly, I don’t know what I want to do yet, or where I want to go, but I know that I want to strive to lead a happy life and I suppose that is all I need.
Matthew Mortensen
I am currently a Junior Biochemistry major attending WLC, and I am a lab manager on this year’s iGEM team; this involved things like dividing and delegating the in-lab workload, designing primers, troubleshooting experiments, and most often just doing the nitty-gritty lab work that needed to be done. Outside of the lab, my main contribution to the team was the design and implementation of our wiki page from scratch- included in this was mostly trial-and-error based relearning of HTML, color schemes, and CSS (thanks w3cschools). I also wrote some and proofread many of the pages for the summer-camp binder. My favorite responsibility was being one of the two lab instructors for our synthetic biology summer camp. As lab instructors we did prep work for labs, went through (sometimes) short lectures on the theoretical basis of the experiments we were performing, and finally guided the group through the planned procedures. All of our procedures worked this year which was great fun, and during the down-time between steps we were able to review and reinforce some of the concepts learned that day.
Outside of the lab, when I have time, I enjoy exploring new types of music, comic books, the occasional video game, long walks to just organize my thoughts, Radio Lab, and Netflix. In the future I hope to pursue a career in science by attending graduate school, although I am not truly sure of what I specifically want to do just yet. In the nearer future I’m very excited to participate on next year’s iGEM team, as we will be starting the process of finding and planning for a new project soon.
Jacob Jodat
I am a sophomore majoring in biochemistry.  I aspire to attend medical school after college I contributed to the project by doing lab work on the safety mechanism, researching the future direction of the project, identifying cultures that could use the final product, and helping at the summer camp. I enjoys science because the topics are very interesting to me and there is always more to learn.  Outside of science I compete in cross country and track, and enjoy watching Netflix in my spare time.
Zach Birner
My name is Zach Birner, I am a junior biochemistry major here at Wisconsin Lutheran College. My overall educational goal is to become a physician though I am unsure of which specialty. To achieve this goal I became an EMT for clinical experience, and joined iGEM to get experience in the lab. Beyond that I would one day like to return to Zambia, where I grew up, and perform aid work. When I am not doing homework or lab work, I enjoy doing outdoor activities such as playing tennis, biking and jogging, as well as playing ping pong. On our iGEM team I served as a lab technician working to create the parts. My specific job was attempting to transform our secretion pump onto a different plasmid.
Ryan George
I am a Biochemistry major at WLC. My intent is to attend medical school after I leave WLC to become a physician. I joined iGEM in order to further his knowledge in basic laboratory techniques and gain general research experience.  In my free time, I enjoy reading, camping, and gaming. I also work on campus as a sound technician, am a dental assistant, and a medical scribe. I contributed to the content and formulation of the website, helped with the summer camp, and assisted in the lab as needed.
Josiah Ricke
​​My name is Josiah Ricke and I am a lab tech on the iGEM team. I also used my meager html skills to assist with the website.  I am thrilled to have the opportunity to improve my interpersonal skills by being part of a team, as well as being able to apply some of the things I've learned in class.  After undergrad I plan on joining the Marine Corps.   I consider myself a connoisseur of fine breakfast meats and above all else a Star Wars fanboy.    .
Cody Dziuk
I am a Biomedical Engineer from the Milwaukee School of Engineering (MSOE) planning on graduating in spring of 2015. After graduation I will assume a job in the biomedical sector; working towards becoming a professionally certified engineer. I joined iGEM to enhance my understanding of mathematical modeling techniques/approaches. In my free time I play bass guitar Conniption, a popular metal band in the Milwaukee area. We recently won a Wisconsin Area Music Industry award for best hard rock/metal band of 2014. I am the developer of the Matlab enzyme kinetics model used by the team.

Lili Yin (Lily)
Hello, everybody. My name is Lili Yin. I’m a sophomore in College of Life Sciences. What attracts me most is human immunology and I really want to acquire more knowledge from different sources. Taking part in iGEM is a great chance for me to broaden my horizon and learn more from relevant researchers as well as to improve my scientific English. I work on the safety part at the beginning but the most dramatic part for me is the physical device of MDC. I’m not good at physics therefore there are many sleepless nights readingliterature. Anyway, the interesting part comes when I can do experiments for our team and set up the wiki. Drawing is my hobby and a way to relax myself. The process of learning about wiki design is happy and to be enjoyed. Additionally, I designed and sketched the shirts for our team. The best preparation for tomorrow is doing your best today. Now I’m ready to come here to share great ideas with counterparts and fulfill our dream.

Yufei Zhang
My name is Zhang Yufei, a sophomore in life sciences college of SCAU. In the past few months, I have joined in the iGEM team. My contribution to the team mainly combines from two parts. The first part, during the brainstorm period, I was in MFC group first and brought up the idea of mixing up MFC with desalination. Later, after the re-grouping, I turned to the idea of logic gates and completed its project primary design. And the second part comes later when our team finish the experiment part and acquire a series of data, I will be responsible for data processing and if it is needed, biological modeling.I join in iGEM because I long for an experience in which I can participate in every step of a science project, very rare chance in university. And until now, I have found myself make progress in paper reading, idea searching and project planning which I hope I can carry on. Compared to many other team members, I am a lot worse than them in biology knowledge and lab technique, but I am fascinated and good at computer things in which I have and will try my best to help the team.

Trip to Calgary aGEM 2014
On September 13, 2014 we made a trip to Calgary to present our iGEM project, “Darwin's Metals”, at geekStarter/Alberta Innovates Technology Futures, hosted at the University of Calgary. This annual gathering of Canadian iGEM and BIOMOD teams provided us with effective constructive feedback on our presentation and our scientific theory from a panel of North American iGEM judges, before the major international iGEM 2014 jamboree in Boston on November 1st.
Our Darwin's Metals project received praise from the judges for the clearly defined mining problem we are attempting to create an iGEM solution for, our original concept, biotechnological feasibility, and environmental and economic relevance. Another much appreciated element of our project was our proposal to introduce additional functionality to the BIOBRICK registry. Our suggestion was to introduce a tracking feature to monitor the sustainability of individual BIOBRICKS, tracking each new application and sequence change for popular BIOBRICKS with demonstrated histories of development and successful implementation within industry. This particular proposed “Human Practices” effort was well-received because the current BIOBRICK registry doesn't provide means for tracking evolution of the “most sustainable” BIOBRICKS as they are altered under the direction of different iGEM teams and research labs over many years.
Constructive criticism mainly revolved around the performance issues surrounding our last-minute-prepared presentation, mainly related to transitions between presenters, and particular slides with communication issues. We also received advice on the different stages of our project, and how we could arrange our project into modules of successive experimental stages. One significant remark on our theoretical model (during a chalkboard elaboration of our intended chemical floatation context) inspired us to reconsider the prioritization of sinking versus floating of targeted minerals.

iGEM Team attributions page
Each team must clearly attribute work done by the student team members on this page.  The team must distinguish work done by the students from work done by others, including the host labs, advisors, instructors, and individuals not on the team roster.
Why do we have this requirement?
Attribution Template
We have this requirement to help the judges know what you did yourselves and what you had help with. We don't mind if you get help with difficult or complex techniques, just be sure to report the work your team did and the work that was done by others.
For example, you might choose to work with an animal model during your project. Working with animals requires getting a license and applying far in advance to conduct certain experiments in many countries. This is something that is difficult to achieve during the course of a summer, but much easier if you can work with a postdoc or PI who has the right licenses.
A great example of complete attribution comes from the Imperial College London 2011 team (scroll down to the bottom of their team page to see attributions).
Here are some of the fields we recommend you have on this page. If there are other areas not listed below, but applicable to your team/project, please feel free to also list them on your attributions page. Please feel free to remove any areas not applicable to your project.

Adam Ziada
Major and Year:
Microbiology and Immunology
Why iGEM:
I joined iGEM this year because I thought it sounded like a lot of fun! I love exploring the unknown, and coming up with wild ideas that might just work. That's what drew me to iGEM, the idea that we really might be able to come up with something crazy and get it to work. That's why I joined iGEM!
Hopes to gain from iGEM:
I was actually hoping to meet a bunch of awesome and nerdy people who shared my interest in molecular and synthetic biology. I'd say that was a success.
What inspires you:
The infinite. People have always talked about limitations. How things can't be done, how they are impossible. I think the impossible, the unobtainable, has always been more of a challenge, something I aspire to. Like a sweet aroma it calls me, always has and always will. One day, I want meet the impossible, the infinite, the endless.
Hobbies:
Well right now I'm learning ballroom dancing! It's actually a ton of fun!!! :D
×
Albertina Wong
Major and Year:
Combined Computer Science and Microbiology and Immunology, Graduated May 2014
Why iGEM:
I had wanted to join iGEM ever since they've promoted it in one of my first year biology classes. Being in Computer Science and Microbiology, I find the ideas of applying engineering principles (ie. reusability, modularization) onto the 'messy' biological systems fascinating. I feel that iGEM is a rare opportunity, especially for undergraduate students, to get to put together a project of their own design and presenting it internationally.
Hopes to gain from iGEM:
I hope to better and refine my modelling skills and knowledge from participating in iGEM and if possible to get to touch a bit of wet lab as well.
What inspires you:
The possibility of alternate realities inspires me and in a way I see research as a means that could bridge us from our present state to one of these realities. It is an incredible privilege to be able to entertain our imagination through practical means of testing and experimentation and of those rare moments when we can reap results from it, there are many thanks to give.
Desired Impact on the World:
It would be an exciting realm to be in the intersection of Artificial Intelligence and Public Health and be able to contribute in that area.
Hobbies:
I enjoy reading the National Geographics, New York Times and every now and then, the Sanger Blog.
×
Anna Muller
Major and Year:
Honors Microbiology and Immunology 4th Year
Why iGEM:
I first heard about iGEM when I was in high school and ever since I wanted to be part of it, for me this is a very exciting opportunity. I first joined the team last year and I enjoyed it so much I decided to return. I can’t wait to make some awesome bacteria! I moved to Canada two years ago from Germany. Now I am really enjoying Vancouver.
Hopes to gain from iGEM:
I hope to play a bigger role in designing the constructs and systems for our project this year. In addition I hope to improve my public speaking skills and learn even more about the creative applications of microbes through this years Giant Jamboree!
What inspires you:
I love bacteria and all sorts of Microbes but aside from microbiology I am interested in marine biology. Through scuba diving, my favourite destination being Egypt, I fell in love with the beautiful underwater world.
Desired Impact on the World:
I love research and I want to pursue a career in science, what that will look like and where I will be is a mystery right now but I’m sure it will all work out.
Hobbies:
My favourite thing to do here is skiing in winter; I can’t wait for next season. On campus you can find me either in the lab, at the gallery, or at the pool napping. But if there is something you should know about me is that I love travelling and living in different places around the world, so this is definitely not my last stop.
×
Ariel Ragetli
Major and Year:
Major in Biochemistry (3rd Year)
Why iGEM:
I heard about iGEM from my second year Biochemistry teaching assistant who told me about past project ideas and the basic design of the program. I was intrigued by the idea of creating machines, little bacteria, that could solve complex problems.
Hopes to gain from iGEM:
I hope to refine my laboratory technique and get the opportunity to work with people vastly more knowledgeable in the world of research and synthetic biology to expand my own knowledge base as well as get the chance to help create something tangible that could potentially have some impact on the world around us.
Desired Impact on the World:
I have always wanted to solve a complex problem, in the context of human diseases, and to physically see the impact of that solution on the people affected.
Hobbies:
Learning Japanese, I have been to Japan twice in my life and am intrigued by the culture and the language. I plan on spending an extended period of time in Japan at one point in my life, and I am continuously practicing and improving my conversational to that end .
×
Daniel Korvin
Major And Year:
Microbiology and Immunology with a Minor in Biochemistry Graduated May 2014
Why iGEM:
I first heard of iGEM through a friend back in 2009. At the the time, I thought he was crazy. 'E. Coli cultures lighting up like traffic lights!?'. Two years later, in 2011, I stumbled across the openwetware wiki while doing research for a project, and this led me to the iGEM page. After seeing the kinds of incredible projects that had been attempted over the years, I was hooked, and knew that I had to join the UBC team at the next available opportunity.
Hope to gain from iGEM:
I hope to improve my understanding of engineering principals in biology and build on my modelling knowledge base, these tools will help me work towards a masters degree in chemical and biological engineering.
What Inspires you:
Everything to do with microbes, especially the application of metabolic engineering to microbes, ask my team mates about chicken sexing or electrobacter and they will tell you!
Hobbies:
My interests include growing and showing off stylish goatees, hiking, and discussing new applications for synthetic biology and metabolic engineering.
×
Eric Stroczynski
Major and Year:
Microbiology and Immunology 3rd Year
Why iGEM:
The first time I herd about iGEM was though a friend who attended one of the information sessions from the year before, I was curious so I decided to check it out.  I was astonished with the creativity, freedom, and quality of the projects and I told myself that I need to be a part of this experience
Hopes to gain from iGEM:
I would love to work on my wet lab skills and learn the in’s and out’s of designing biological systems. Since this is my first experience with iGEM and synthetic biology I am excited to soak in as much information as I can.
What inspires you:
To put it simply, good music, good friends, and good cheer.
Desired Impact on the World:
I think microbes are fascinating and for the time being I see myself transforming the world through creative research. But who knows, I’m sure iGEM will allow me to open my mind to new possibilities within science, business, and policy alike.
Hobbies:
I love beer, craft beer to be precise, and I love to share it with friends.
×
Fisal Elstone
Major and Year:
Integrated Sciences, Graduated May 2014!
Why iGEM:
I joined IGEM last year because it remains a unique undergraduate experience that forces teams of students try to solve problems in a multidimensional, collaborative manner. This multidimensional approach seems reflective of how problems are solved in the working world and there are few opportunities to work on projects like this in an undergraduate degree. I was also drawn in by the incredible imagination and success of past teams! Needless to say, I really enjoyed the IGEM experience and hence I decided to return.
Hopes to gain from iGEM:
I hope to gain an appreciation and a broader sense of what is possible as a undergrad in todays scientific community. From the project itself I hope to improve my wetlab skills as well as gain more exposure to the academic/industry interface.
What inspires you:
Honestly IGEM really inspires me; it’s quite remarkable to see passionate young scientists working towards ambitious projects and collaborating with other students from around the globe. I am a big fan of the Jamboree in particular.
Desired Impact on the World:
I have always wanted to help people and to this day it remains the strongest indicator of what I want to do. I think the intersection between clinical research and medicine would be a fascinating realm to enter.
Hobbies:
I try to spend as much time outside as I can be it Skiing, Climbing, or Backpacking; on quiet days its netflix and boardgames.
×
Jacky Chan
Major and Year:
5th Year Engineering Physics

Jeffrey Pea
Major and Year:
Microbiology and Immunology (2nd Year)
Why iGEM:
Having just joined this year, I heard about iGEM throughout my first year but was not exactly sure what it was. However, after going to several introductory meetings I was immediately hooked by passionate and knowledgeable everyone was on the team. The realm of synthetic biology seemed truly fascinating, for it was a field I wasn't very familiar with and yet very curious about. Soon, I began to realize that iGEM provided an outlet for me to be exploratory and innovative in research, using the fundamental knowledge I learned previously and implementing them in novel experiments. The combination of being able to apply my learning in a laboratory setting, being able to learn more advanced techniques related my background, and being able to immerse myself in an exponentially growing field that is synthetic biology is the main reasoning for joining the iGEM team.
Hopes to gain from iGEM:
By being a part of iGEM, I hope to become a more well-rounded scientist and researcher. My goal is to become more knowledgeable in the field of synthetic biology, whether that is through reading background content or applying lab techniques. That way, I can contribute more to the team in the future as well as apply what I have learned to other similar experiences down the road.
What inspires you:
What has really driven me throughout my life has been the dynamic between the natural curiosity humans have towards the unknown and the ability to share the discoveries stemmed from that interest to society. It is fascinating to see how driven humanity can be to venture into the unknown, risking everything for the sake of obtaining knowledge. What fascinates me further is how captivated these scientists are in explaining these findings to everyone else so that all can benefit from the newfound information. This process is one that I believe makes humanity very special and gifted and one that drives me to do my part to help.
Desired Impact on the World:
Humanitarian aid has always been a passion of mine, especially with it came to investigating the various public health concerns around the world. I would love to be an integral part of research pivotal in improving the health of communities currently lacking in accessible healthcare. Whether this is through drug discovery or disease control, it would be fantastic to contribute to work that leads to aiding others.
Hobbies:
When I am not working on iGEM, I am often outside playing sports or supporting my favorite sport teams. In particular, I am an avid soccer fan, passionately supporting the clubs Tottenham Hotspurs and San Jose Earthquakes. In exploration of my more artistic side, I frequently spend my time painting and learning new languages.

Joe Ho
Major and Year:
Integrated Sciences Graduated January 2014
Why iGEM:
I joined iGEM because of a Terry Talk by a past iGEM member, who described the elegance of synthetic biology and the need to create standardized parts. That moment on, I was hooked into iGEM and its limitless potential.
Hopes to gain from iGEM:
I have been with iGEM for several years now and every year I love being able to take a concept and try to turn it into something tangible, useful, and meaningful; it truly is a unique undergraduate experience. The jamboree is one of my favourite parts of iGEM, its inspiring to see all the different projects and hear what inspired other teams.
What inspires you:
Nature, its incredible complexity juxtaposed with its elegant simplicity is just mind blowing. I see nature and its application as being as limitless as the imagination itself.
Desired Impact on the World:
I live and breathe science, ask mike, and I see myself having a long enjoyable life pondering synthetic systems in microbes, or probing the pathophysiology and treatments of human diseases.
Hobbies:
Outside from lab work and reading ""binders full of journal articles"", I enjoy watching hockey and maintaining my vegetable garden. Occasionally, I enjoy swimming and hiking.

Joel Kumlin
Major and Year:
Chemical Engineering w. Minor in Honours Mathematics
Why iGEM:
2013 - I wanted to learn some biological engineering practices as well as create some worthwhile biological models.
Hopes to gain from iGEM:
I joined iGEM last year to get more experience with creating models to describe real-world phenomena, this year I am hoping to transfer some skills in modeling and numerical methods to the newer members so that UBC can continue to build award winning models.
What inspires you:
There are so many unfinished. untried, non-optimized systems that can be improved on in this world. The more I learn the more inefficiencies I see.  I get inspired by people thinking of new ways to deal with these inefficiencies and get excited coming up with elegant solutions to these problems. There is so much work to do on this world, I'm not sure if I'll ever be able to retire!
Desired impact on the world:
I'm interested in advancing technology, various technologies can be better understood when implementing the language of mathematics. As much as we'd like to think differently, most engineering is still done with ""opinion-based"" decision making. There are chemical and biological fields where the mathematics has not been reduced to a low enough form to become useful for most engineers - moving to ""science-based"" or ""math-based"" decision making can reduce inefficiencies that cost time, money and energy. And I would like to be a part of applying practical mathematics to real world problems.
Hobbies:
When not in labs, or staring at excited liquid crystals - I like hitting the ball long on golf courses and running down shots on the tennis court.

Melody Lu
Major and Year:
Medical Laboratory Science, 4th year
Why iGEM:
I just joined iGEM this year and actually I only just heard of iGEM this year. I have been working in a research lab for more than a year. Different from the conventional undergraduate research experience, the cool thing about iGEM is that it is totally student run and we have people who major in different fields in science and even engineering! As an undergrad who has always been working and studying with people in my own major, I really look forward to working with these people coming from various disciplines and coming up with something amazing!
Hopes to gain from iGEM:
I hope to explore the various parts of iGEM. IGEM is not just about designing and carrying out an experiment and presenting the result in the end. We also need to think about the practical aspects of the project: the funding, the feasibility and the social impact, etc. I hope at the end of iGEM, I can gain an insight into scientific research in general.
What inspires you:
The power of research. Research keeps pushing the limits between what we know and the unknown. The findings can be totally unpredicted sometimes and it can also shock the world.
Desired impact on the world:
I want to become a health professional and help out people in my community. And if possible in the future, I also wish to become a WHO agent and save the people who cannot afford the basic medical needs.
Hobbies:
Like many Asians, I go play badminton. I also enjoy ballroom dancing and swimming.

Tudor Lapuste
Major and Year:
Combined Computer Science and Microbiology and Immunology
Why iGEM:
I've been fascinated by topics in synthetic biology ever since I saw a TED talk in 2010 where Craig Venter revealed the ""first fully functioning, reproducing cell controlled by synthetic DNA"". I've tried to join various synthetic biology efforts since then, including the DIYbio group here in Vancouver, and when I saw that iGEM was accepting new team members, it was a no-brainer!
Hopes to gain from iGEM:
I hope to get my hands dirty (not literally of course, I'll be wearing gloves) in the lab and figure out the best way to present information on our team wiki.
What inspires you:
My main inspiration is this idea that technology is bootstrapping on itself and accelerating towards what Ray Kurzweil calls The Singularity. I am a positive person, and as such I see this resulting in a world of abundance, rather than a Terminator-esque dystopia where the machines take over. Radical abundance for all!
Desired impact on the world:
Currently I am planning/am actively pursuing entrepreneurship, and my mission statement reads as ""creating a better world through good design"". What do you do with your spare time: I am an avid non-fiction reader, and as such I enjoy discussing biotechnology, artificial intelligence, design, and philosophy with my friends. I am also known to be found coding at odd hours.

Wenchen Zhao
Major and Year:
Honours in Biotechnology program
Why iGEM:
This is my first year being an iGEM team member. I joined iGEM because I am very interested in synthetic biology field. It is a very creative and amazing field where you can design your own biological machine and make it beneficial to human beings. Also, I think this is a valuable opportunity to be involved in team work and making progress together with a common goal in our mind.
Hopes to gain from iGEM:
I hope to gain more knowledge about synthetic biology field and practice my wet lab skills.
What inspires you:
The various possibilities of ways to construct a genetically engineered machine inspire me a lot to participate in this competition. Troubleshooting and figuring out what is going wrong in our design never fail to attract me either.
Desired impact on the world:
In the future, I want to participate and make a positive impact in a biotech company related to cancer or pharmacology. I also look forward to develop myself in leadership areas through experience and training offered by the company.
Hobbies:
I enjoy playing the piano, watching American dramas.

Zeki Ekmekci
Major and Year:
Combined Computer Science and Microbiology and Immunology, going into 2nd year
Why iGEM:
I joined iGEM this year. As soon as I decided to attend UBC, I did some research about the ways I can be involved with research. I found about iGEM team and contacted the team. I attended the team selection meetings the following term, was interviewed and selected! iGEM is a rare and great opportunity to connect with people in the community. I also like the fact that team is consisted of students from different backgrounds such as engineering and computer science. I see great potential in the idea of applying computation and engineering to biological concepts.
Hopes to gain from iGEM:
I hope to get the essential wetlab skills for my major and also get started on the modelling and the other computational aspects of microbiology and immunology. I also want to connect with other scientists in UBC and get to know UBC faculty and students.
What inspires you:
I am very inspired by the scientists that combine their information on different fields and solve big problems. I like the fact that by looking from different perspectives or approaching a problem in an entirely new way, it is possible to derive solutions- solutions that wouldn't possibly be solved  with the cumulative knowledge on one specific field. This makes me think that there is no challenge or problem that cannot be solved.
Desired impact on the world:
I want to create cures and drugs for autoimmune diseases and infectious diseases by not only using laboratory skills but also computer generated modeling.
Hobbies:
I appreciate every aspect of music. I like improving my classical music skills and participate in classical music activities such as performing Beethoven's 9th with Vancouver Symphony Orchestra as a member of UBC Choral Union. I also like spending time on Youtube and finding out news/improvements around the globe.

Major and Year:
Microbiology and Immunology
Why iGEM:
I joined iGEM this year because I thought it sounded like a lot of fun! I love exploring the unknown, and coming up with wild ideas that might just work. That's what drew me to iGEM, the idea that we really might be able to come up with something crazy and get it to work. That's why I joined iGEM!
Hopes to gain from iGEM:
I was actually hoping to meet a bunch of awesome and nerdy people who shared my interest in molecular and synthetic biology. I'd say that was a success.
What inspires you:
The infinite. People have always talked about limitations. How things can't be done, how they are impossible. I think the impossible, the unobtainable, has always been more of a challenge, something I aspire to. Like a sweet aroma it calls me, always has and always will. One day, I want meet the impossible, the infinite, the endless.
Hobbies:
Well right now I'm learning ballroom dancing! It's actually a ton of fun!!! :D

Albertina Wong
Major and Year:
Combined Computer Science and Microbiology and Immunology, Graduated May 2014
Why iGEM:
I had wanted to join iGEM ever since they've promoted it in one of my first year biology classes. Being in Computer Science and Microbiology, I find the ideas of applying engineering principles (ie. reusability, modularization) onto the 'messy' biological systems fascinating. I feel that iGEM is a rare opportunity, especially for undergraduate students, to get to put together a project of their own design and presenting it internationally.
Hopes to gain from iGEM:
I hope to better and refine my modelling skills and knowledge from participating in iGEM and if possible to get to touch a bit of wet lab as well.
What inspires you:
The possibility of alternate realities inspires me and in a way I see research as a means that could bridge us from our present state to one of these realities. It is an incredible privilege to be able to entertain our imagination through practical means of testing and experimentation and of those rare moments when we can reap results from it, there are many thanks to give.
Desired Impact on the World:
It would be an exciting realm to be in the intersection of Artificial Intelligence and Public Health and be able to contribute in that area.
Hobbies:
I enjoy reading the National Geographics, New York Times and every now and then, the Sanger Blog.

Now I am really enjoying Vancouver.
Hopes to gain from iGEM:
I hope to play a bigger role in designing the constructs and systems for our project this year. In addition I hope to improve my public speaking skills and learn even more about the creative applications of microbes through this years Giant Jamboree!
What inspires you:
I love bacteria and all sorts of Microbes but aside from microbiology I am interested in marine biology. Through scuba diving, my favourite destination being Egypt, I fell in love with the beautiful underwater world.
Desired Impact on the World:
I love research and I want to pursue a career in science, what that will look like and where I will be is a mystery right now but I’m sure it will all work out.
Hobbies:
My favourite thing to do here is skiing in winter; I can’t wait for next season. On campus you can find me either in the lab, at the gallery, or at the pool napping. But if there is something you should know about me is that I love travelling and living in different places around the world, so this is definitely not my last stop.

Daniel Korvin
Major And Year:
Microbiology and Immunology with a Minor in Biochemistry Graduated May 2014
Why iGEM:
I first heard of iGEM through a friend back in 2009. At the the time, I thought he was crazy. 'E. Coli cultures lighting up like traffic lights!?'. Two years later, in 2011, I stumbled across the openwetware wiki while doing research for a project, and this led me to the iGEM page. After seeing the kinds of incredible projects that had been attempted over the years, I was hooked, and knew that I had to join the UBC team at the next available opportunity.
Hope to gain from iGEM:
I hope to improve my understanding of engineering principals in biology and build on my modelling knowledge base, these tools will help me work towards a masters degree in chemical and biological engineering.
What Inspires you:
Everything to do with microbes, especially the application of metabolic engineering to microbes, ask my team mates about chicken sexing or electrobacter and they will tell you!
Hobbies:
My interests include growing and showing off stylish goatees, hiking, and discussing new applications for synthetic biology and metabolic engineering.

Fisal Elstone
Major and Year:
Integrated Sciences, Graduated May 2014!
Why iGEM:
I joined IGEM last year because it remains a unique undergraduate experience that forces teams of students try to solve problems in a multidimensional, collaborative manner. This multidimensional approach seems reflective of how problems are solved in the working world and there are few opportunities to work on projects like this in an undergraduate degree. I was also drawn in by the incredible imagination and success of past teams! Needless to say, I really enjoyed the IGEM experience and hence I decided to return.
Hopes to gain from iGEM:
I hope to gain an appreciation and a broader sense of what is possible as a undergrad in todays scientific community. From the project itself I hope to improve my wetlab skills as well as gain more exposure to the academic/industry interface.
What inspires you:
Honestly IGEM really inspires me; it’s quite remarkable to see passionate young scientists working towards ambitious projects and collaborating with other students from around the globe. I am a big fan of the Jamboree in particular.
Desired Impact on the World:
I have always wanted to help people and to this day it remains the strongest indicator of what I want to do. I think the intersection between clinical research and medicine would be a fascinating realm to enter.
Hobbies:
I try to spend as much time outside as I can be it Skiing, Climbing, or Backpacking; on quiet days its netflix and boardgames.

Needless to say, I enjoyed the experience of iGEM so much that I decided to come back for the 2014 team!
Hopes to gain from iGEM:
Through iGEM, i hope to better realize the true scale of possibilities in synthetic biology and its true value in our everyday life! I also hope to gain a better understanding of the integration of science in society and develop skills to address these issues.
What inspires you:
""We were not put on this earth to be unremarkable, unimportant, or unnoticed. Make sure you live a life less ordinary."" Every individuals participating in iGEM lives by these words and I have never been as inspired as I was at the iGEM World Championships in Boston last year!
What impact do you want to have on the world:
I would love to pursue a career in bioprocess engineering using synthetic biology to produce biofuels!
Hobbies:
I am an adrenaline-junkie at heart and love activities that get my heart pumping: from hiking to skydiving, I'm always looking for a new adventure!

Philip Lam
Major and Year:
4th Year Applied Biology, specializing in Plant and Soil Sciences
Why iGEM:
I joined iGEM this year in order to appreciate the unlimited tamed potentials of anthropogenic biodiversity; it’s my favourite dynamic-and-renewable resource to exploit/domesticate/sustain.
Hopes to gain from iGEM:
Initially, I had merely hoped to learn how to transform brewer’s yeast to produce terpenes and polyketides of plant origin, just for the power-trip. Eventually, I decided to stay for the annual Albertan roadtrip of friendship.
What inspires you:
Plant chemicals, fungal and bacterial metabolism, and animal consciousness.  People like Paul Stamets, Alexander Shulgin, Francis Crick, Kary Mullis, Aldous Huxley, Paul Kroeger, George Abbas.
Desired Impact on the world:
I wish to honour my ancestors.
Hobbies:
Watching Youtube reruns of Fear Factor, while getting shunned for watching it.

Tudor Lapuste
Major and Year:
Combined Computer Science and Microbiology and Immunology
Why iGEM:
I've been fascinated by topics in synthetic biology ever since I saw a TED talk in 2010 where Craig Venter revealed the ""first fully functioning, reproducing cell controlled by synthetic DNA"". I've tried to join various synthetic biology efforts since then, including the DIYbio group here in Vancouver, and when I saw that iGEM was accepting new team members, it was a no-brainer!
Hopes to gain from iGEM:
I hope to get my hands dirty (not literally of course, I'll be wearing gloves) in the lab and figure out the best way to present information on our team wiki.
What inspires you:
My main inspiration is this idea that technology is bootstrapping on itself and accelerating towards what Ray Kurzweil calls The Singularity. I am a positive person, and as such I see this resulting in a world of abundance, rather than a Terminator-esque dystopia where the machines take over. Radical abundance for all!
Desired impact on the world:
Currently I am planning/am actively pursuing entrepreneurship, and my mission statement reads as ""creating a better world through good design"". What do you do with your spare time: I am an avid non-fiction reader, and as such I enjoy discussing biotechnology, artificial intelligence, design, and philosophy with my friends. I am also known to be found coding at odd hours.

Wenchen Zhao
Major and Year:
Honours in Biotechnology program
Why iGEM:
This is my first year being an iGEM team member. I joined iGEM because I am very interested in synthetic biology field. It is a very creative and amazing field where you can design your own biological machine and make it beneficial to human beings. Also, I think this is a valuable opportunity to be involved in team work and making progress together with a common goal in our mind.
Hopes to gain from iGEM:
I hope to gain more knowledge about synthetic biology field and practice my wet lab skills.
What inspires you:
The various possibilities of ways to construct a genetically engineered machine inspire me a lot to participate in this competition. Troubleshooting and figuring out what is going wrong in our design never fail to attract me either.
Desired impact on the world:
In the future, I want to participate and make a positive impact in a biotech company related to cancer or pharmacology. I also look forward to develop myself in leadership areas through experience and training offered by the company.
Hobbies:
I enjoy playing the piano, watching American dramas.

Zeki Ekmekci
Major and Year:
Combined Computer Science and Microbiology and Immunology, going into 2nd year
Why iGEM:
I joined iGEM this year. As soon as I decided to attend UBC, I did some research about the ways I can be involved with research. I found about iGEM team and contacted the team. I attended the team selection meetings the following term, was interviewed and selected! iGEM is a rare and great opportunity to connect with people in the community. I also like the fact that team is consisted of students from different backgrounds such as engineering and computer science. I see great potential in the idea of applying computation and engineering to biological concepts.
Hopes to gain from iGEM:
I hope to get the essential wetlab skills for my major and also get started on the modelling and the other computational aspects of microbiology and immunology. I also want to connect with other scientists in UBC and get to know UBC faculty and students.
What inspires you:
I am very inspired by the scientists that combine their information on different fields and solve big problems. I like the fact that by looking from different perspectives or approaching a problem in an entirely new way, it is possible to derive solutions- solutions that wouldn't possibly be solved  with the cumulative knowledge on one specific field. This makes me think that there is no challenge or problem that cannot be solved.
Desired impact on the world:
I want to create cures and drugs for autoimmune diseases and infectious diseases by not only using laboratory skills but also computer generated modeling.
Hobbies:
I appreciate every aspect of music. I like improving my classical music skills and participate in classical music activities such as performing Beethoven's 9th with Vancouver Symphony Orchestra as a member of UBC Choral Union. I also like spending time on Youtube and finding out news/improvements around the globe.

iGEM Team attributions page
Each team must clearly attribute work done by the student team members on this page.  The team must distinguish work done by the students from work done by others, including the host labs, advisors, instructors, and individuals not on the team roster.
Why do we have this requirement?
Attribution Template
We have this requirement to help the judges know what you did yourselves and what you had help with. We don't mind if you get help with difficult or complex techniques, just be sure to report the work your team did and the work that was done by others.
For example, you might choose to work with an animal model during your project. Working with animals requires getting a license and applying far in advance to conduct certain experiments in many countries. This is something that is difficult to achieve during the course of a summer, but much easier if you can work with a postdoc or PI who has the right licenses.
A great example of complete attribution comes from the Imperial College London 2011 team (scroll down to the bottom of their team page to see attributions).
Here are some of the fields we recommend you have on this page. If there are other areas not listed below, but applicable to your team/project, please feel free to also list them on your attributions page. Please feel free to remove any areas not applicable to your project.
General Support

University of Calgary
The 2014 University of Calgary iGEM team would like to thank and acknowledge the support received from the University in terms of stipends, support personnel, facilities and materials all of which made this project possible. The O’Brien Centre for the Bachelor of Health Sciences provided laboratories and a classroom for us to work in, even allowing us to continue our work into the fall term. Special thanks to the Faculty of Medicine and Schulich School of Engineering for their financial support. We'd like to thank Will Gill, an intern at the Schulich School of Engineering Machine Shop, for building our prototype, and performing the fluid flow analysis.
Advisor and Instructor Support
All research was conducted by the undergraduate members on our team. We did however have guidance from a number of advisors. Special thanks to Anthony Schryvers and Anders Nygren for their consistent leadership and support despite their busy schedules. Cesar Rodriguez was our go-to resource for all things tech related, and was invaluable with helping us develop our schematic. And of course, thanks to our always patient graduate advisors, Dave Curran and Jamie Fegan.
Additional Professors and University Staff
We would like to thank a few other Professors and staff who guided our project. The incredibly generous Dr.  Huddleston provided us with ample amounts of gram and spore staining solutions, for which we are eternally grateful. Dr. Wong was kind enough to provide us with B. subtilis with which our project was based; and provided us with guidance on how to transform the cells. Dr. Abebe Bayih and Dr. Lisa Allen Scott were both incredibly important mentors to us when developing our project and the experience they provided us with is priceless.
External Support
We would like to take this opportunity to thank Mr. Mofoluwaso Abolarin for gracing us with an interview from which we were able to draw from his firsthand experiences. The Public Health Agency of Canada for providing us with the incredible opportunity to attend the Biological and Toxin Weapons Conference. In addition, the Foundation for Innovative New Diagnostics for taking time to advise our Policies and Practices team amidst a busy time of year. Lastly, the Health Policy Project provided us with their immense knowledge regarding biological policies that could affect our final device. Also, a huge thank you to Gary Cheung for taking wonderful pictures at Beakerhead, and Iain George and Sean Booth from BGSA for Bacteria Art.

Ainna Randhawa
Biological Sciences (3rd Year)
Everyone knows that Annas are pretty darn cool. The Calgary team lucked out because this year, there are two of us. Thus, I spent the summer as ""Randy"" or ""Ainna v2.0"" (the other one is a darling, but she is the beta version and still needs a few tweaks). I joined iGEM this year, and was primarily involved with the design aspect of our project. I also made several birthdays and goodbye cards, which was obviously my most important contribution. Outside of iGEM, I like to... Ha! How silly, there is nothing outside of iGEM. What is this ""life"" you speak of? Is it pretty? My plans post-iGEM are to complete my undergraduate degree in Biological Sciences (hopefully) and subsequently play it by ear. As they say ""Life is really simple, but we insist on making it complicated.""
Alina Kunitskaya
Chemical Engineering (2nd Year)
This is my first year on the University of Calgary’s iGEM team. As an engineering student on the team, I was responsible for 3D modelling and animations using Autodesk Maya, quantitative modelling, prototype design, circuits design and programming Arduino Uno microcontroller. Over the summer, I enjoyed working in a dynamic team of undergraduate and graduate students with different backgrounds. I love that iGEM is student driven and so interdisciplinary. While I am waiting for my models and animations to render, I can be found running, hiking, biking, reading or……studying. Some of the topics I like to explore on my free time include space travel, quantum physics, and effects of quantum physics in biology.

Dan Ziemianowicz
Biochemistry (Graduated)
I've recently completed my undergraduate degree in Biochemistry and am continuing my career in structural proteomics. In the meantime I've dedicated my time, efforts, and sleep, to our iGEM project. I've lent a hand in most aspects of our project, but my focus has been on designing sample preparation and the genetic circuit itself. After lab hours I do my best to spend time outside, wandering about parks or enjoying good company in the woods. Otherwise I'm playing squash, longboarding, learning to cook a new dish, or reading a book. You can't do good science without a balanced life.
Dave Curran
Bioinformatics (3rd Year PhD Candidate)
I am the team’s returning iGEM veteran, having been a student with Calgary in 2007 and 2008, and leading the team in 2010. I like to think the team keeps me around for my experience and bioinformatics expertise, but they just think I’m old and bearded, and fixed the printer that one time. Oh well. Anyways, I like bioinformatics; modeling protein structures and sequence evolution is super cool. And parasitic worms are truly disgusting creatures (worse than you can imagine), so working on them is a lot of fun. When not working on my computer for work, I’m generally tinkering on my desktop at home, playing volleyball, or shreddin’ the pow (snowboarding for the unenlightened).
Dennis Kim
Biomedical Sciences (2nd Year)
This is my first year in iGEM and during the project I was involved primarily with the reporter and repressor operons used in our pathogen detection system. My main interest has been in assembling the necessary genes into a functioning operon and cloning it within Escherichia coli for future integration into the thrC locus of our Bacillus subtilis. In my free time I enjoy learning about sacred texts and watching badly reviewed movies with close friends.
Emma Fu
Cellular, Molecular, & Microbial Biology (4th Year)
This was my first year with iGEM. The semester before joining iGEM I took a research course and enjoyed learning about research techniques. Naturally, I wanted to put what I learned to work, so I joined the iGEM team. I'm an avid traveller and unexpectedly spent most of the summer abroad, so I was a floater for the summer helping out wherever needed. Aside from travelling, I spend my time reading, binge-watching TV shows on Netflix or doing ballet.
Israt Yasmeen
Health Sciences (4th Year)
I am a fourth year student in the Bachelor of Health Sciences program. I have dedicated most of my summer to B. subtilis and getting it to transform efficiently. Being a member of iGEM has allowed me to venture into the world of synthetic biology, a field I was completely unaware of. When my time with B. subtilis does not go as planned, I give us some time by transporting myself to unknown lands and going on exciting adventures by reading books. Another way I travel is by listening to music from around the world. Apart from appreciating the diversity of lab racks, I have survived the summer by relying on something that has been a constant companion: Coke (the drinking kind of course).
Jamie Fegan
Microbiology & Infectious Diseases (4th Year PhD Candidate)
This year marks my second year involved with the Calgary iGEM team where I have returned as a graduate advisor. I enjoy the collaborative nature iGEM and believe the multidisciplinary approach to projects provides invaluable experience to a diverse group of students. When I'm not comparing herding undergrads to herding cats, I can be found in the lab working on studying vaccine design and antigen engineering against the pathogen Neisseria meningitidis, the causative agent of meningococcal disease. When I manage to escape the academic bubble, I can be found playing volleyball or squash or hanging out at home with a glass of wine, binge watching entire TV series with my cats.
Wm. Keith van der Meulen
Electrical & Computer Engineering/Computer Science (3rd Year)
After enjoying my iGEM experience with the 2013 iGEM Calgary team, I returned to this year's team as an advisor. My primary responsibility this year has been building the wiki. Besides iGEM, I run a non-profit called Foster Bikes that donates bikes to foster children, mentor a handful of younger students, and keep myself actively my universities volunteering and networking circles. On the days that I'm not behind my computer coding for assignments, iGEM, or any of my other million projects, I enjoy playing piano, hiking, skiing, and pretending I have an the time for a normal social life.

Laura Fader
Chemical Engineering (2nd Year)
This is my first year with iGEM, and as an engineer on the team I have been working primarily on the modelling and prototype aspects of our device as well as human practices. I am a second year chemical engineering student with a minor in entrepreneurship and enterprise development. In my spare time I enjoy playing field hockey and the keytar. I also have a large passion for travelling and volunteering internationally.
Mariya Shtil
Chemical Engineering (3rd Year)
I am a third year chemical engineering student at the Schulich School of Engineering at the University of Calgary. This is my first year as an undergraduate researcher with iGEM and my primary responsibilities were designing the physical prototype, programming the microcontroller and the sensors, 3D modelling with Maya, and wiring circuitry. In my spare time I enjoy photography, reading, hiking and pretending that I have a social life while being a hermit and watching Suits.
Saira Farooq
Health Sciences (4th Year)
This is my first year in iGEM as an undergraduate researcher. I am a prospective graduate from the Bachelor of Health Sciences program at the University of Calgary, currently in my fourth and hopefully last year. I did a lot of lab work this summer on the transformation side of things, especially with regards to optimizing transformation of our PCR products and how that will feed into the genetic circuit. In my free time, I like to spend time with my family, eat my sorrows away and place lab equipment on shelves where Israt cannot reach them.
Sarah Townes
Biological Sciences (4th Year)
This is my first year on the iGEM team. I was a part of the Detector's sub-group and so I spent most of my time in the wet lab this year. When I’m not suffocating under mounds of sequencing results, I love playing basketball, sleeping, eating and hanging out with my kitties. I also volunteer at a shelter three times a week where I care for and play with homeless cats.
Shelby Fretwell
Biological Sciences (4th Year)
This summer I was responsible for generating images of the viable B. subtilis bacterial cells after transformation, and of the B. subtilis spores using various staining techniques, such as Gram and Spore stains. I was also responsible for checking the viability of B. subtilis spores after they had been subjected to harsh conditions and quantifying the growth seen. I was also involved in lots of other projects, such as sporulation, to lend a hand. I helped out my other team members where ever they needed an extra hand with the work that they were completing.  As well as being involved with iGEM this summer, I also volunteered in a 24 hour animal hospital and worked two different jobs.  My life is not all work though! I enjoy drawing, reading, spending time with my friends and family, and anything car related.  Thankfuly these help maintain my sanity during the crazy experience that is iGEM.

My plans post-iGEM are to graduate (hopefully) and subsequently play it by ear. As they say, ""Yesterday is history, tomorrow is a mystery, and today is a gift. That's why it's called the present.""
Dan Ziemianowicz
Biochemistry (Graduated)
I've recently completed my undergraduate degree in Biochemistry and am continuing my career in structural proteomics. In the meantime I've dedicated my time, efforts, and sleep, to our iGEM project. I've lent a hand in most aspects of our project, but my focus has been on designing sample preparation and the genetic circuit itself. After lab hours I do my best to spend time outside, wandering about parks or enjoying good company in the woods. Otherwise I'm playing squash, longboarding, learning to cook a new dish, or reading a book. You can't do good science without a balanced life.
Dave Curran
Bioinformatics (3rd Year PhD Candidate)
I am the team’s returning iGEM veteran, having been a student with Calgary in 2007 and 2008, and leading the team in 2010. I like to think the team keeps me around for my experience and bioinformatics expertise, but they just think I’m old and bearded, and fixed the printer that one time. Oh well. Anyways, I like bioinformatics; modeling protein structures and sequence evolution is super cool. And parasitic worms are truly disgusting creatures (worse than you can imagine), so working on them is a lot of fun. When not working on my computer for work, I’m generally tinkering on my desktop at home, playing volleyball, or shreddin’ the pow (snowboarding for the unenlightened).
Dennis Kim
Biomedical Sciences (2nd Year)
This is my first year in iGEM and during the project I was involved primarily with the reporter and repressor operons used in our pathogen detection system. My main interest has been in assembling the necessary genes into a functioning operon and cloning it within Escherichia coli for future integration into the thrC locus of our Bacillus subtilis. In my free time I enjoy learning about sacred texts and watching badly reviewed movies with close friends.
Emma Fu
Cellular, Molecular, & Microbial Biology (4th Year)
This was my first year with iGEM. The semester before joining iGEM I took a research course and enjoyed learning about research techniques. Naturally, I wanted to put what I learned to work, so I joined the iGEM team. I'm an avid traveller and unexpectedly spent most of the summer abroad, so I was a floater for the summer helping out wherever needed. Aside from travelling, I spend my time reading, binge-watching TV shows on Netflix or doing ballet.
Israt Yasmeen
Health Sciences (4th Year)
I am a fourth year student in the Bachelor of Health Sciences program. I have dedicated most of my summer to B. subtilis and getting it to transform efficiently. Being a member of iGEM has allowed me to venture into the world of synthetic biology, a field I was completely unaware of. When my time with B. subtilis does not go as planned, I give us some time by transporting myself to unknown lands and going on exciting adventures by reading books. Another way I travel is by listening to music from around the world. Apart from appreciating the diversity of lab racks, I have survived the summer by relying on something that has been a constant companion: Coke (the drinking kind of course).
Jamie Fegan
Microbiology & Infectious Diseases (4th Year PhD Candidate)
This year marks my second year involved with the Calgary iGEM team where I have returned as a graduate advisor. I enjoy the collaborative nature iGEM and believe the multidisciplinary approach to projects provides invaluable experience to a diverse group of students. When I'm not comparing herding undergrads to herding cats, I can be found in the lab working on studying vaccine design and antigen engineering against the pathogen Neisseria meningitidis, the causative agent of meningococcal disease. When I manage to escape the academic bubble, I can be found playing volleyball or squash or hanging out at home with a glass of wine, binge watching entire TV series with my cats.
Wm. Keith van der Meulen
Electrical & Computer Engineering/Computer Science (3rd Year)
After enjoying my iGEM experience with the 2013 iGEM Calgary team, I returned to this year's team as an advisor. My primary responsibility this year has been building the wiki. Besides iGEM, I run a non-profit called Foster Bikes that donates bikes to foster children, mentor a handful of younger students, and keep myself actively my universities volunteering and networking circles. On the days that I'm not behind my computer coding for assignments, iGEM, or any of my other million projects, I enjoy playing piano, hiking, skiing, and pretending I have an the time for a normal social life.

Laura Fader
Chemical Engineering (2nd Year)
This is my first year with iGEM, and as an engineer on the team I have been working primarily on the modelling and prototype aspects of our device as well as human practices. I am a second year chemical engineering student with a minor in entrepreneurship and enterprise development. In my spare time I enjoy playing field hockey and the keytar. I also have a large passion for travelling and volunteering internationally.
Mariya Shtil
Chemical Engineering (3rd Year)
I am a third year chemical engineering student at the Schulich School of Engineering at the University of Calgary. This is my first year as an undergraduate researcher with iGEM and my primary responsibilities were designing the physical prototype, programming the microcontroller and the sensors, 3D modelling with Maya, and wiring circuitry. In my spare time I enjoy photography, reading, hiking and pretending that I have a social life while being a hermit and watching Suits.
Saira Farooq
Health Sciences (4th Year)
This is my first year in iGEM as an undergraduate researcher. I am a prospective graduate from the Bachelor of Health Sciences program at the University of Calgary, currently in my fourth and hopefully last year. I did a lot of lab work this summer on the transformation side of things, especially with regards to optimizing transformation of our PCR products and how that will feed into the genetic circuit. In my free time, I like to spend time with my family, eat my sorrows away and place lab equipment on shelves where Israt cannot reach them.
Sarah Townes
Biological Sciences (4th Year)
This is my first year on the iGEM team. I was a part of the Detector's sub-group and so I spent most of my time in the wet lab this year. When I’m not suffocating under mounds of sequencing results, I love playing basketball, sleeping, eating and hanging out with my kitties. I also volunteer at a shelter three times a week where I care for and play with homeless cats.
Shelby Fretwell
Biological Sciences (4th Year)
This summer I was responsible for generating images of the viable B. subtilis bacterial cells after transformation, and of the B. subtilis spores using various staining techniques, such as Gram and Spore stains. I was also responsible for checking the viability of B. subtilis spores after they had been subjected to harsh conditions and quantifying the growth seen. I was also involved in lots of other projects, such as sporulation, to lend a hand. I helped out my other team members where ever they needed an extra hand with the work that they were completing.  As well as being involved with iGEM this summer, I also volunteered in a 24 hour animal hospital and worked two different jobs.  My life is not all work though! I enjoy drawing, reading, spending time with my friends and family, and anything car related.  Thankfuly these help maintain my sanity during the crazy experience that is iGEM.

The Team
Our Team
We are exceptionally grateful for the immense enthusiasm and dedication of all of Vanderbilt iGEM's members             in the wetware division. It is because of such hard work and dedication that during our team's first year in             competition we have accomplished so much.
In particular, we would like to recognize a few select individuals who truly went above and beyond for the             sake of the team.
Bronze membership recognizes those who contributed in at least one experiment over the course of the year.             Silver membership recognizes those who attended at least four experiments. For members who participated at             the group step, this corresponds to perfect attendance for all scheduled sessions. Gold membership recognizes             those who were among the most active members of the organization. Finally, platinum membership recognizes             those who devoted at least one hundred hours of time during both the spring and fall semesters.
Those who held special positions in the organization, such as group managers and team officers, are also             acknowledged. It should also be noted that only members who were directly involved in the wetware division are             included on this list.
Please see the team pages of our university's other divisions to see the contributions of other team             members.

We would like to thank the Vanderbilt University School of Engineering for their help in initiating Vanderbilt iGEM. Without their financial support this organization would not have been able to take root at Vanderbilt.
Additionally, the resources of the VIIBRE personal, SyBBURE, and the McCarra lab have been invaluable throughout our project and we hope to utilize their support as iGEM continues to grow at Vanderbilt University.
We would also like to give thanks to the authors of the papers listed below, without their prior research our ideas and methods may never have come to fruition. We thank them for their contributions to microfluidics and hope to continue their work into the future.

The Team
Vanderbilt Microfluidics is supported by the Vanderbilt Institute for Integrative Biosystems Research and Education (VIIBRE), part of the Vanderbilt University Biomedical Engineering and Physics department. VIIBRE is a well established microfluidics research institute with projects focusing on organ on a chip (OoC) devices and high throughput screening devices.
In addition to support from VIIBRE, the Vanderbilt Microfluidics team is supported by the Searle Systems Biology and Bioengineering Undergraduate Research Experience (SyBBURE). SyBBURE seeks to educate students in research techniques and enable undergraduates to perform cutting edge research in a variety of disciplines. Support from SyBBURE was integral to founding and funding the Vanderbilt Microfluidics team.

iGEM Team attributions page
Each team must clearly attribute work done by the student team members on this page.  The team must distinguish work done by the students from work done by others, including the host labs, advisors, instructors, and individuals not on the team roster.
Why do we have this requirement?
Attribution Template
We have this requirement to help the judges know what you did yourselves and what you had help with. We don't mind if you get help with difficult or complex techniques, just be sure to report the work your team did and the work that was done by others.
For example, you might choose to work with an animal model during your project. Working with animals requires getting a license and applying far in advance to conduct certain experiments in many countries. This is something that is difficult to achieve during the course of a summer, but much easier if you can work with a postdoc or PI who has the right licenses.
A great example of complete attribution comes from the Imperial College London 2011 team (scroll down to the bottom of their team page to see attributions).
Here are some of the fields we recommend you have on this page. If there are other areas not listed below, but applicable to your team/project, please feel free to also list them on your attributions page. Please feel free to remove any areas not applicable to your project.
General Support
Project support and advice
Fundraising help and advice
Lab support
Difficult technique support
Project advisor support
Wiki support
Presentation coaching
Policy & Practices support
Thanks and acknowledgements for all other people involved in helping make a successful iGEM team.

The Team
We are exceptionally grateful for the immense enthusiasm and dedication of all of Vanderbilt iGEM's members in the wetware division. It is because of such hard work and dedication that during our team's first year in competition we have accomplished so much. In particular, we would like to recognize a few select individuals who truly went above and beyond for the sake of the team. Bronze membership recognizes those who contributed in at least one experiment over the course of the year. Silver membership recognizes those who attended at least four experiments. For members who participated at the group step, this corresponds to perfect attendance for all scheduled sessions. Gold membership recognizes those who were among the most active members of the organization. Finally, platinum membership recognizes those who devoted at least one hundred hours of time during both the spring and fall semesters. Those who held special positions in the organization, such as group managers and team officers, are also acknowledged. It should also be noted that only members who were directly involved in the wetware division are included on this list. Please see the team pages of our university's other divisions to see the contributions of other team members.

Attributions
iGEM Team attributions page
Each team must clearly attribute work done by the student team members on this page.  The team must distinguish work done by the students from work done by others, including the host labs, advisors, instructors, and individuals not on the team roster.
Why do we have this requirement?
Attribution Template
We have this requirement to help the judges know what you did yourselves and what you had help with. We don't mind if you get help with difficult or complex techniques, just be sure to report the work your team did and the work that was done by others.
For example, you might choose to work with an animal model during your project. Working with animals requires getting a license and applying far in advance to conduct certain experiments in many countries. This is something that is difficult to achieve during the course of a summer, but much easier if you can work with a postdoc or PI who has the right licenses.
A great example of complete attribution comes from the Imperial College London 2011 team (scroll down to the bottom of their team page to see attributions).
Here are some of the fields we recommend you have on this page. If there are other areas not listed below, but applicable to your team/project, please feel free to also list them on your attributions page. Please feel free to remove any areas not applicable to your project.
General Support
Project support and advice
Fundraising help and advice
Lab support
Difficult technique support
Project advisor support
Wiki support
Presentation coaching
Policy & Practices support
Thanks and acknowledgements for all other people involved in helping make a successful iGEM team.

Special thanks
Premises
Us
Our team is proud to say that we almost did all the work on our own: finding sponsors, making communication tools about our project, finding the protocols to use and optimize them. However, we needed occasional assistance during our project, therefore we required help from different people: scientists, administrators, specialists and even lay persons. We would like to warmly thank all these persons for their contribution and support. Our project moved forward because they offered their help.
Ulule: a crowdfunding website
Ulule is the first European crowdfunding website. We have posted our SubtiTree project on this site to collect funds for paying the Giant Jamboree fee. The collect was successful: we had 53 supporters and € 1,787 collected! We warmly thank all the supporters, it was very encouraging to see that people mobilized for us!
We would like to thank:
Debra Baker, François Barbeau, Valérie Chataigner, Brune Couffignal, Serge Couffignal, Jacques de Grenier, Guillaume Debar, Colas Decloitre, Caroline Delabre, Charlene Douard, Laurence Fournié, Rose Fournié, Chrystelle Gaucher, Nicolas Gilet, Aurélie Gosseau, Sarah Guiziou, Carole Jouve, Damien Kanitzer, Pierre Lagoutte, Anne-Marie Lang, Myriam Le Nours, Julie Mabille, Mylène Manière, Eddy Manière, Stéphanie Marty, Nathan Mirassou, Pierre Mirassou, Sophie Molina, Raymond Molina, Eric Molina, Ngoc Thu Hang Pham, Bruno Paci, Frédéric Paletou, Nicolas Perez, Jean Perron, Pierre Pettera, Lucas Picault, Nathalie Pineau, Elodie Prattico, Florence Rigaud, Marianne et Dominique Serres, Gilles Truan, Clémence Witzmann.
Scientists
iGEM instructors
First of all, we warmly thank our amazing instructor: Gilles Truan. He was with us from the beginning to the end and even more! He is the master of cloning. He is the captain of PCR. Moreover, he knows how to grill sausages better than anyone! We kindly thank all the other instructors that helped us when we were lost with the scientific part or stressed by the lack of money. We especially thank Brice Enjalbert, Florence Bordes, Kaymeuang Cam, Magali Remaud-Siméon, Philippe Soucaille, Stéphane Guillouet, Isabelle Meynial-Salles and Alain Marty. Your advice and encouragements were very precious to us, and you deserve these thanks for all the energy you spent answering our questions (and we know that we are very energy-consuming!). To finish, a special thanks to Claude Maranges, who helped us a lot with the sponsoring aspect and all the administrative problems that we encountered. Indeed, if you have any administrative issue, he is able to solve it in less than 2 minutes (5 minutes during the holidays)! He knows how to make everything smooth in record time.
Bacillus subtilis specialists
Even if Bacillus subtilis is a gram-positive bacterium model, none of our instructors ever worked with it. It is why we asked other people's help when we had questions about B. subtilis. We would like to thank Nathalie Campo for her advice about B. subtilis culture, her encouragements and her kindness. Her friend Thierry Doan helped us too: he brilliantly answered our questions about B. subtilis. We also thank Sarah Guiziou, iGEMer of the 2013 Toulouse team, for her advice and her protocols.
Fungi specialists
We are grateful to Christophe Roux who gave us two non-pathogenic strains of fungi: Aspergillus brasiliensis, Trichoderma reesei, Aspergillus nidulans and Chaetomium globusum. We used them to test our SubtiTree system.
We deeply thank Sylvain Raffaele and Marielle Barascud for their ENORMOUS help at the end of the project. They took time to inject SubtiTree in Nicotiana Benthamiana, setting up the ultimate and most valuable proof for our system (See Results ). May the force be with them forever...
Other iGEM teams
Since several parts that we wanted to use were not in the iGEM kit plates, we asked iGEM teams to send us some parts: - Thanks to the iGEM Warsaw team, especially Radoslaw Stachowiak, for sending us the biobricks BBa_K780000 , BBa_K780001 , BBa_K780002 and BBa_K780003 . - Thanks to the iGEM Utah State team, especially Charles Miller, for sending us the biobrick BBa_K1162001 . - Thanks to the iGEM Munich team, especially Jara Radek, for sending us the biobrick BBa_K823021 , BBa_K823022 and BBa_K823023 .
Lab support
Thanks to Sylvie Cancel and Yves Dutruy, lab technicians, for helping us when we did not know where to find Yeast Extract or how to use the new refrigerated centrifuge. They were with us as soon as we began the manipulations and they answer to all our questions. A special thank to Patrick Chekroun, talended glass blower, for making the tubes system used in Chemotaxis tests (See Experimental results .
To finish, thanks to Fabien Albert, storeman of the LISBP, for his sympathy and his availability.
Press
A lot of different local newspapers were interested in SubtiTree. In this part, we would like to thank all the journalists that came to meet us: - Hélène Ménal for her article in the newspaper 20 Minutes - Philippe Font for his article in the newspaper Metronews - Bernard Davodeau for his article in the newspaper La Dépêche - Delphine Russeil for her article in the newspaper La Voix du Midi - Angélique Mangon and Jack Levé for their television report on the channel France 3 Midi-Pyrénées - Philip Hemme for his article about the French iGEM teams on the website LaBiotech.fr - Olivier Schlama for his article in the newspaper Midi Libre - Virginie Brancotte for her article in the newspaper Fluvial
Ethics
We thank Vincent Grégoire-Delory, responsible of the ethics platform at Toulouse White Biotechnology, for coming to our lab and sharing his huge knowledge with us around pizzas and a good bottle of wine! He suggested us several points to deepen our ethical reflection.
Design and Communication
We thank the INSA Toulouse Communication Department for giving us INSA Toulouse goodies and helping us with the organization of our acknowledgment day.
Thanks to Hélène Cabanac, graphic designer, for her help with the design of our presentation and our poster.
Thanks to the web designer Adrien Nicod for accepting to work with us and being patient with the remarks that each team member was saying!
Thanks to Pierre Pettera, for his help with the wiki in the last night before the wiki freeze!
Special thanks
We warmly thank Didier Combes, Nick Lindley , Pierre Monsan and Nicolas Combébiac for their support and their efficiency in the face of our administrative problems. A special thanks to Gilbert Chauvel for his interest into our project and his valuable support. A special thanks to Matthieu Arlat for giving us a lot of good advice, helping us with the sponsoring part and his enthusiasm. To finish, thanks to the God of Synthetic Biology for giving us such results!
Premises
We would like to thank the INSA de Toulouse for hosting us during the whole summer (and even more actually!).
Us
And finally, we thank... us. For being in the lab all the summer, for our devotion to the plane trees, for the perseverance in the bad days and for putting up each other. Therefore thanks to the entire team for this wonderful and exciting project! We would like to thank also our mums and dads because without them we would not be there and thus the project would not have been done! And also the mum and dad of our mums and dads and the mum and dad of the mum and dad of our mums and dads and... you should get it!!

Let's introduce you to our fabulous tree-friendly team, 100% biodegradable and certified pesticide-free.
Students
(Move your mouse over image to enlarge!)
Diane Barbay
Feature: Diligent (Wait a minute, I have to write down these results in my notebook! ㅋㅋㅋ)
Studies: First year of Biochemistry Master at INSA Toulouse engineering school
About her: Hardworking, Diane is the most consciencious in her work: her notebook is so clean and organized! She is persevering and always tries to find the answer to the problem (except when plasmids shortens between two digestions…). She talks to bacteria to encourage them taking up plasmid during transformation. She is like a babysitter for our cells :-)
Emeline Flajollet
Feature: Expert in competent cells (Oh no, I have to make competent cells again… ㅋㅋㅋ)
Studies: First year of Master of Microbiology at Paul Sabatier University of Toulouse
About her: Emeline looks discreet at first, but when you meet her, you discover a frank person who knows how to express her opinions and how to be understood, which is a good thing for team work. She is diligent and involved in her work, always trying to do her best, and providing advice to others. She spends a lot of time on social networks, allowing us to keep in touch with other teams.
Mathieu Fournié
Feature: Expert in communication (I found someone else who wants to interview us!)
Studies: First year of Master of Microbiology at Paul Sabatier University of Toulouse
About him: Initial founder of the project, Mathieu is a fan of Midi Pyrenées's region and is eager to protect its natural environment and resources. He is devoted to the project and does his best to succeed. His leadership skills help us focus on the main goals and deadlines. Even if it makes him forget to do his own tasks! His good interpersonal skills and numerous contacts helped us to capture media attention.
Florie Gosseau
Feature: Our IT expert (Modeling? Ok let’s do it!)
Studies: First year of Bioinformatics and Biological Systems Master at Paul Sabatier University of Toulouse
About her: Florie is a smiling and spontaneous girl. She is this kind of person capable of giving a true smile when nothing works, and she can disentangle conflicts thanks to her patience and her kindness. She is really helpful and never says no when you ask for service. She is also frank and reports problems when there are some. Finally, she is the only one good at informatics, which makes her indispensable for us! When she wears her lab coat, she is able to fly like Batman or being the queen of cats' kingdom. Really, it is wonderful to see her!
Camille Jourdan
Feature: Expert in cloning (Camille, which enzyme should I take?)
Studies: First year of Biochemistry Master at INSA Toulouse engineering school
About him: Jovial and funny, Camille has sometimes eruptions of madness which makes him so special. Conversely, he is capable of incredible moments of intelligence and concentration (primers and plasmids hold no secret for him) and he is really diligent. He is sarcastic but definitely not nasty. He is the athlete of the team and never misses an opportunity to make gymnastics exercises or Plasmid Dance!
Aurélie Kanitzer
Feature: Distracted (Oh I forgot my keys! I have to go back home, see you in 15 minutes!)
Studies: First year of Biochemistry Master at INSA Toulouse engineering school
About her: Aurélie is a joyful and spontaneous person, which makes you laugh and smile. Often distracted, she can make blunders… She is natural and honest and does not try to play a role. She is open-minded and helpful: you can count on her. Strong and sensitive at the same time, she is able to face difficulties. Don’t go by appearances, this tiny girl has personality and she does not let others walk over her!
Laureen Mirassou
Feature: Our best negotiator (Don’t worry about prices for flight tickets, I deal with that)
Studies: First year of Biochemistry Master at INSA Toulouse engineering school
About her: Laureen is a mix of kindness, helpfulness and generosity. Always trying to help people, she is essential to ease tensions and to solve social issues: she says what is wrong gently and calmly. Her good interpersonal abilities helped us to make good business and to solve many administrative problems. Her high level of English proficiency is also something precious for the team.
Manon Molina
Feature: Organized (Let’s make a to-do-list!)
Studies: First year of Biochemistry Master at INSA Toulouse engineering school
About her: Manon is organized: she always makes to-do-lists to not  forget anything and do tasks in time. Thank goodness, she is here to monitor the budget and do the accounting! She makes her work conscientiously and meticulously, not allowing mistakes. She is kind and lenient but can also be frank when she does not endorse your methods. In short: serious and devoted to the project.
Fanny Pineau
Feature: Absent-minded (which cloning are we doing?)
Studies: First year of Biochemistry Master at INSA Toulouse engineering school
About her: In the lab, Fanny is often lost in her works: too many cloning at the same time, you should not ask too much to her blond brain! Not enough concentrated, she can sometimes make blunders. Besides that, she is applied and perfectionist when she plunges into her work. Finally, she is a joyful and smiling person; also honest and frank, telling it like it is.
Pierre Reitzer
Feature: Relaxed (Make a presentation barefoot, why not?)
Studies: First year of Biochemistry Master at INSA Toulouse engineering school
About him: Pierre is the co-founder of the project. He is really friendly and is always willing to discuss and help people with their experiments. Moreover, he greets us with a smile each time we see him in the lab. He is spontaneous and forthright: we know what he thinks. Sometimes, he has his head in the clouds and fails the same experiment three times… But he is involved in his work and does not count hours.
Abdel Touré
Feature: Luxury tastes (Why shouldn't we go to the Hilton?)
Studies: First year of Bioinformatics and Biological Systems Master at Paul Sabatier University of Toulouse
About him: Abdel is this kind of person that you remember: he is always jovial and running everywhere. He is a funny guy who likes making jokes. But, be careful! He is also sensitive, your jokes might not make him laugh at all. He takes care of his appearance, and likes smoking his e-cigarette. He always swears in English, but we like it because this is funny, and he is a good English speaker!
Instructors
Gilles Truan
Feature: Our amazing instructor!
Job: Senior Researcher at CNRS (Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique) and at LISBP (Laboratoire d'Ingénierie des Systèmes Biologiques et des Procédés).
About him: He is with us from the beginning to the end as a father (and already a grandfather!!), our instructor is the master of cloning and the captain of PCR! He provided us with valuable help and good tips he learned at the time he was supervising Marie Curie's doctoral thesis.
Brice Enjalbert
Feature: The right-hand man of our amazing instructor!
Job: Lecturer at LISBP (Laboratoire d'Ingénierie des Systèmes Biologiques et des Procédés).

What do trees lining the “Canal du Midi” think about SubtiTree?
According to our homemade impartial survey, 94% of the questioned plane trees approve our project and are interested in  serving as guinea pigs for our new bacterial medicine. This percentage represents 41,580 trees which  are also gathered in the association called: “Happy tree friends“.
Have you ever tried to estimate the kilometers traveled by your team during this summer?
According to our calculations, one team member walks approximately 4 kilometers per day all around the  laboratory. This represents 5,544 kilometers for the whole team during the 126 days of this epic  adventure.  What does that mean exactly? Simply that we could walk, cycle, swim or whatever you want to  Kazakhstan, Russia, Kenya… We could even have reached the USA but we decided to stay in the lab  and take the plane to go to Boston!
Multidisciplinary… Yes we are!
Housework in our laboratory became necessary when most of people were in vacations except us.  But do you know the novelty this year in our team? Times are changing because now men are  cleaning! ;-)
The “can’t miss it” event of the summer: the 2014 Football (also called Soccer in some third zone countries!!) World Cup!
From 06/12/14 to 07/13/14, the Toulouse iGEM Team was cheering for the French team. During the  games of the French team, our group was juggling with wet lab and large screen projections! Despite  our support, the French team did not win the World Cup. However, we have not said our last world  yet: let’s see what will happen in 2018… ;-)
Have you ever...
...forgotten a tube culture or a Petri dish?
Never? Let us show you what happens in that case!
...tried to make a 3% agarose gel?
To finish this part, let’s do the official Awards Ceremony of the 2014 Toulouse iGEM Team!
The Geek Award goes to... Florie who spent the longest time in front of her laptop for the modeling part!
The latest-survivor-of-weekly-meetings goes to... Diane who stayed up until 3am because she was skyping from South Korea!
The worst singer award goes to ... Abdel who  spent the whole day singing badly in the lab!
The dancer award goes to ... Camille who did the famous Plasmid Dance!
The “hello you” award goes to... Pierre who was always saying  “Hello you” each time he meets someone (approximatively 256 times per day)!
The most tired award goes to... Manon but we still do not know why!
The misplaced ideas award goes to... Mathieu but you do not want to know why!
The perseverance award goes to... Emeline who succeeded a cloning after twelve trials!
The drawing award goes to... Fanny who drew our first SubtiTree logo!
The best phone-caller award goes to... Laureen who was our perfect lab secretary!
The biggest blunder in the lab award goes to ... Aurélie who poured an agarose gel without gel tray!
And last but not least ... The Best Nervous breakdown Award goes to ... Our -20°C freezer! The whole team is grateful for its hard work during a hot summer! Three successive breakdowns during the hot days of summer: thank you freezer, so long chap, we’ll unplug you after iGEM is finished and you’ll retire, hopefully not in the Canal du Midi…

Premises
Us
Our team is proud to say that we almost did all the work on our own: finding sponsors, making communication tools about our project, finding the protocols to use and optimize them. However, we needed occasional assistance during our project, therefore we required help from different people: scientists, administrators, specialists and even lay persons. We would like to warmly thank all these persons for their contribution and support. Our project moved forward because they offered their help.
Ulule: a crowdfunding website
Ulule is the first European crowdfunding website. We have posted our SubtiTree project on this site to collect funds for paying the Giant Jamboree fee. The collect was successful: we had 53 supporters and € 1,787 collected! We warmly thank all the supporters, it was very encouraging to see that people mobilized for us!
We would like to thank:
Debra Baker, François Barbeau, Valérie Chataigner, Brune Couffignal, Serge Couffignal, Jacques de Grenier, Guillaume Debar, Colas Decloitre, Caroline Delabre, Charlene Douard, Laurence Fournié, Rose Fournié, Chrystelle Gaucher, Nicolas Gilet, Aurélie Gosseau, Sarah Guiziou, Carole Jouve, Damien Kanitzer, Pierre Lagoutte, Anne-Marie Lang, Myriam Le Nours, Julie Mabille, Mylène Manière, Eddy Manière, Stéphanie Marty, Nathan Mirassou, Pierre Mirassou, Sophie Molina, Raymond Molina, Eric Molina, Ngoc Thu Hang Pham, Bruno Paci, Frédéric Paletou, Nicolas Perez, Jean Perron, Pierre Pettera, Lucas Picault, Nathalie Pineau, Elodie Prattico, Florence Rigaud, Marianne et Dominique Serres, Gilles Truan, Clémence Witzmann.
Scientists
iGEM instructors
First of all, we warmly thank our amazing instructor: Gilles Truan. He was with us from the beginning to the end and even more! He is the master of cloning. He is the captain of PCR. Moreover, he knows how to grill sausages better than anyone! We kindly thank all the other instructors that helped us when we were lost with the scientific part or stressed by the lack of money. We especially thank Brice Enjalbert, Florence Bordes, Kaymeuang Cam, Magali Remaud-Siméon, Philippe Soucaille, Stéphane Guillouet, Isabelle Meynial-Salles and Alain Marty. Your advice and encouragements were very precious to us, and you deserve these thanks for all the energy you spent answering our questions (and we know that we are very energy-consuming!). To finish, a special thanks to Claude Maranges, who helped us a lot with the sponsoring aspect and all the administrative problems that we encountered. Indeed, if you have any administrative issue, he is able to solve it in less than 2 minutes (5 minutes during the holidays)! He knows how to make everything smooth in record time.
Bacillus subtilis specialists
Even if Bacillus subtilis is a gram-positive bacterium model, none of our instructors ever worked with it. It is why we asked other people's help when we had questions about B. subtilis. We would like to thank Nathalie Campo for her advice about B. subtilis culture, her encouragements and her kindness. Her friend Thierry Doan helped us too: he brilliantly answered our questions about B. subtilis. We also thank Sarah Guiziou, iGEMer of the 2013 Toulouse team, for her advice and her protocols.
Fungi specialists
We are grateful to Christophe Roux who gave us two non-pathogenic strains of fungi: Aspergillus brasiliensis, Trichoderma reesei, Aspergillus nidulans and Chaetomium globusum. We used them to test our SubtiTree system.
We deeply thank Sylvain Raffaele and Marielle Barascud for their ENORMOUS help at the end of the project. They took time to inject SubtiTree in Nicotiana Benthamiana, setting up the ultimate and most valuable proof for our system (See Results ). May the force be with them forever...
Other iGEM teams
Since several parts that we wanted to use were not in the iGEM kit plates, we asked iGEM teams to send us some parts: - Thanks to the iGEM Warsaw team, especially Radoslaw Stachowiak, for sending us the biobricks BBa_K780000 , BBa_K780001 , BBa_K780002 and BBa_K780003 . - Thanks to the iGEM Utah State team, especially Charles Miller, for sending us the biobrick BBa_K1162001 . - Thanks to the iGEM Munich team, especially Jara Radek, for sending us the biobrick BBa_K823021 , BBa_K823022 and BBa_K823023 .
Lab support
Thanks to Sylvie Cancel and Yves Dutruy, lab technicians, for helping us when we did not know where to find Yeast Extract or how to use the new refrigerated centrifuge. They were with us as soon as we began the manipulations and they answer to all our questions. A special thank to Patrick Chekroun, talended glass blower, for making the tubes system used in Chemotaxis tests (See Experimental results .
To finish, thanks to Fabien Albert, storeman of the LISBP, for his sympathy and his availability.
Press
A lot of different local newspapers were interested in SubtiTree. In this part, we would like to thank all the journalists that came to meet us: - Hélène Ménal for her article in the newspaper 20 Minutes - Philippe Font for his article in the newspaper Metronews - Bernard Davodeau for his article in the newspaper La Dépêche - Delphine Russeil for her article in the newspaper La Voix du Midi - Angélique Mangon and Jack Levé for their television report on the channel France 3 Midi-Pyrénées - Philip Hemme for his article about the French iGEM teams on the website LaBiotech.fr - Olivier Schlama for his article in the newspaper Midi Libre - Virginie Brancotte for her article in the newspaper Fluvial
Ethics
We thank Vincent Grégoire-Delory, responsible of the ethics platform at Toulouse White Biotechnology, for coming to our lab and sharing his huge knowledge with us around pizzas and a good bottle of wine! He suggested us several points to deepen our ethical reflection.
Design and Communication
We thank the INSA Toulouse Communication Department for giving us INSA Toulouse goodies and helping us with the organization of our acknowledgment day.
Thanks to Hélène Cabanac, graphic designer, for her help with the design of our presentation and our poster.
Thanks to the web designer Adrien Nicod for accepting to work with us and being patient with the remarks that each team member was saying!
Thanks to Pierre Pettera, for his help with the wiki in the last night before the wiki freeze!
Special thanks
We warmly thank Didier Combes, Nick Lindley , Pierre Monsan and Nicolas Combébiac for their support and their efficiency in the face of our administrative problems. A special thanks to Gilbert Chauvel for his interest into our project and his valuable support. A special thanks to Matthieu Arlat for giving us a lot of good advice, helping us with the sponsoring part and his enthusiasm. To finish, thanks to the God of Synthetic Biology for giving us such results!
Premises
We would like to thank the INSA de Toulouse for hosting us during the whole summer (and even more actually!).
Us
And finally, we thank... us. For being in the lab all the summer, for our devotion to the plane trees, for the perseverance in the bad days and for putting up each other. Therefore thanks to the entire team for this wonderful and exciting project! We would like to thank also our mums and dads because without them we would not be there and thus the project would not have been done! And also the mum and dad of our mums and dads and the mum and dad of the mum and dad of our mums and dads and... you should get it!!

iGEM Team attributions page
Each team must clearly attribute work done by the student team members on this page.  The team must distinguish work done by the students from work done by others, including the host labs, advisors, instructors, and individuals not on the team roster.
Why do we have this requirement?
Attribution Template
We have this requirement to help the judges know what you did yourselves and what you had help with. We don't mind if you get help with difficult or complex techniques, just be sure to report the work your team did and the work that was done by others.
For example, you might choose to work with an animal model during your project. Working with animals requires getting a license and applying far in advance to conduct certain experiments in many countries. This is something that is difficult to achieve during the course of a summer, but much easier if you can work with a postdoc or PI who has the right licenses.
A great example of complete attribution comes from the Imperial College London 2011 team (scroll down to the bottom of their team page to see attributions).
Here are some of the fields we recommend you have on this page. If there are other areas not listed below, but applicable to your team/project, please feel free to also list them on your attributions page. Please feel free to remove any areas not applicable to your project.
General Support
Project support and advice
Fundraising help and advice
Lab support
Difficult technique support
Project advisor support
Wiki support
Presentation coaching
Policy & Practices support
Thanks and acknowledgements for all other people involved in helping make a successful iGEM team.

In this section we would like to recognize and give thanks to the people and organizations that have made our research this year possible.
We would first like to recognize our faculty advisors, Dr. Thomas Barker, Dr. Mark Styczynski, and Dr. Eric Gaucher. Professor Barker provided us with the greatest gift of laboratory space, as well as assistance in securing funding and other laboratory resources for our research. In addition, Dr. Barker, Dr. Stycynski, and Dr. Gaucher gave us insight and feedback during the formulation and design of our research goals, and continued to make themselves available for such feedback throughout the iGEM timeline. They have also contributed by maintaining the legacy of iGEM at Georgia Tech, ensuring the continued success and growth of the program among the undergraduate students from one year to the next.
In addition to our faculty advisors, we would also like to recognise our graduate student advisers Dwight Chambers and Haylee Bachman who have been invaluable to us in improving our lab performance and planning the steps to creating and characterizing our parts and devices. From the very first day, they provided us with laboratory training and feedback on our designs, and in the lab they were our resources for mastering new protocols and maintaining organization within our team.
Lastly we would like to give thanks to our corporate and collegiate sponsors. Our corporate sponsors including Geneious, Genscript, IDT, and Macrogen have provided us with the tools, reagents, and funds to pursue our research. Beyond this we would like to thank the College of Engineering and the school of Chemistry and Biochemistry at Georgia Tech for the travel funds used to send our team to this year's Giant Jamboree.
Thank You!

Georgia Tech
The Georgia Institute of Technology, located in the heart of Atlanta, is one of the top research universities in the United States. Not only is Gerogia Tech one of the top science and technology schools in the world, but is currently ranked as the number seven public university in the United States, according to the U.S. News & World Report. Georgia Tech was founded as the Georgia School of Technology in 1885 as a trade school, and in 1948, it changed its name to the Georgia Institute of Technology to reflect its transformation from a trade school to a university. Today, the institute has six different colleges and offers degrees in 34 different undergraduate majors. The engineering college is ranked fifth in the nation overall by the U.S. News and World Report, with the biomedical engineering program ranking fourth in the nation.
Georgia Tech’s name has also made quite a splash in the athletic world, especially in 1996 when the Georgia Tech campus was the venue of many of the athletic events in the summer Olympics, with Olympic athletes living in dormitories. The pool events at the Olympics were held in Georgia Tech’s very own aquatic center in the renowned campus recreation center. Georgia Tech boasts one of the best on-campus recreation center’s in the nation, and many celebrities can be seen attending this very gym. Recently, Georgia Tech’s campus was the shooting site for the movie The Internship, and this year another movie is being filmed near campus. The university’s two beloved mascots are Buzz, the Yellow Jacket and the Ramblin’ Wreck. Additionally, the school is a NCAA Division I school having won the football national championship title four times since its founding.

Troy von Beck
Troy von Beck, Wiki Czar, Handyman, and genuine otaku. I study biomedical engineering for my major, but my ultimate goal is to become a pathologist and contribute to the development of new vaccines. My speech patterns favor interjections and statements such as ""Aye"", ""That is most unfortunate"", and ""Oh My Glob"". I prefer the beat of music to the meaning of its lyrics, and my absurdity knows no bounds. I can cook minute rice in 58 seconds and my proudest achievement is level 99 charizard.
Coleen Tran
Hello readers,
The lovely and sophisticated lady, Coleen Tran can't write her bio right now. She's busy riding a horse backwards with me. Listening to me reading romantic poetry while I make a bouquet of paper flowers from each read page. Ingesting my delicious Old Spice man smell. Being serenaded on the Moon with a view of the Earth, while surviving off the oxygen in my lungs via a passionate kiss.
This bio is now diamonds.
Swan dive.
EDIT:With my last few breaths, I finally decided to write my bio. My name is Coleen Tran. I am the Lab Magistrate who makes sure that everything is in order. I am majoring in Biology and Biomedical Engineering. When I’m not on the Moon, I like to watch movies, read, and feast on pastries. My crowning achievement in life thus far has been defeating level 605 of Candy Crush, but I hope to one-day use synthetic biology to develop a successful gene therapy treatment.
Jennifer Zhang
Georgia Tech iGEM’s resident rainbow, Jennifer Zhang is usually seen running away from people asking for a pot of gold. With just a single hair flick, she can stop a baby from crying while showering fortunate pedestrians with starbursts and skittles. A strand of her hair has the potential to create a wand far more powerful than the Elder Wand. When not studying Biomedical Engineering, she is hopelessly devoted to theatre, spending her free time 20 feet in the air hanging lights.
Katie Fitton
My name is Katie Fitton. I am the president of the iGEM team, making sure everything that we are doing gets recorded. I am currently studying biochemistry and hope to go to pharmacy school after I graduate. In my free time in lab, I like to plan parties with glowing bacteria and food on petri dishes. Hopefully one day one of these parties will actually happen, and all my time planning will not go to waste.
Tashfia Chowdury
Hey! My name is Tashfia Chowdhury, and I’m the Secretary, Gel Master and lab rat for our iGEM team. I basically make sure that whatever we do is recorded both in and out of the lab. I am also the main point of contact between the faculty and students for our team. Currently, I’m a third year Biomedical Engineering student minoring in Chemistry, and pursuing a pre-med track. After graduation, my plan is to attend medical school whilst doing simultaneous research in a field of my own choice. In the time that I’m not tending to my iGEM duties, I like making gels. I believe our unique iGEM way of making agarose gels are highly therapeutic, requiring a certain degree of precision and patience. So far, my greatest achievement in life was performing CPR without breaking the patient’s sternum. Yaaay!
Stefan Tassoulas
My name is Stefan Tassoulas, from the live music capital of the world, Austin, TX. I grew up under two cultures, American and Greek. Every other summer, I would go to Greece and live with my relatives and then come back to America and go to school. I took interest in biochemistry in my ventures in olive fields of my village, riding my bike around, pondering about how the olives grow and what makes them so delicious. Now, at Georgia Tech, I followed my interests and I am now a Biochemistry student and I am now an iGEMer
Lambros Tassoulas
My name is Lambros Tassoulas. Born in the great country of Texas, I am a worldly person who takes interest in a wide variety of cultures. If someone tells me, “It’s all Greek to me” I would tell them “no” because I know Greek but that doesn’t mean I will be able to understand your experience. My interests academically are biochemistry and specifically protein engineering. When I am not using the pipet, I play football and crush waves on the concrete with my longboard.
Jenny Boothby
Hey! I'm Jenny, and I am a fifth year Biomedical Engineering major with a minor in Biology from Bradenton, FL. I joined the GT iGEM team in 2012, and I am back for more this year! I am heavily involved in Atlanta-area volleyball, and I love to read! I will be graduating in December, and I hope to pursue a PhD in Global Health Engineering after working full time for a couple years.
Anirudh Joshi
My name is Anirudh Joshi and I am a second year undergraduate majoring in biomedical engineering and minoring in computer science. I have lived in two different 'Silicon Valleys'; 9 years in San Jose, California and 9 years in Bangalore, India. When I am not learning about new technology, I spend my time cheering on my favorite European soccer team Arsenal. After graduating I hope to pursue my interests in medical devices and neuroengineering.
Tanvi Rao
My name is Tanvi Rao and I am a second year undergraduate studying biomedical engineering.  I was born in India, raised in Mississippi, and now reside in Atlanta where I attend Georgia Tech.  I am pre-med and hope to one day be a doctor with Doctors without Borders.  There are few things I love more than a good book, a large coke icee, and a gargantuan tree to perch in.  Other things I like to do in my spare time are play tennis, paint, and have adventures!
Graduate Advisors
Dwight McCoy Chambers
Dwight graduated from MIT in 2007 with a Bachelor's degree in Nuclear Science and Engineering and obtained a Master's degree in Nuclear Science and Engineering in 2008 with Drs. Jackie Yanch and Bevin Engelward.  Dwight started Emory University's Medical Scientist Training Program in the fall of 2010 and transitioned to his PhD phase in the spring of 2012 at Georgia Tech.  He joined Dr. Thomas Barker's lab in the fall of 2012 where he is currently a graduate student.
Dwight is orignially from Nashville, TN.  He is the son of Carol McCoy and Richard Chambers and brother to Davis.  He loves low-stakes poker, BBQ, and skeet/trap shooting.  He hates running but he (tries/)does it anyway.
Haylee Bachman
During my undergraduate studies I conducted research for 2.5 years in Bio-inorganic Chemistry under Dr. Michele McGibony, investigating Photodynamic Therapy Agents. I was funded for summer research with the NSF-ASPIRES grant.
I spent 2 years at Georgia Tech in a Soft Matter lab working under Dr. Andrew Lyon, optimizing a protein production system for a novel single domain variable antibody fragment which targets fibrin with high affinity and specificity. I then transitioned to working under Dr. Thomas Barker in the Matrix Biology and Engineering Lab.

iGEM Team attributions page
Each team must clearly attribute work done by the student team members on this page.  The team must distinguish work done by the students from work done by others, including the host labs, advisors, instructors, and individuals not on the team roster.
Why do we have this requirement?
Attribution Template
We have this requirement to help the judges know what you did yourselves and what you had help with. We don't mind if you get help with difficult or complex techniques, just be sure to report the work your team did and the work that was done by others.
For example, you might choose to work with an animal model during your project. Working with animals requires getting a license and applying far in advance to conduct certain experiments in many countries. This is something that is difficult to achieve during the course of a summer, but much easier if you can work with a postdoc or PI who has the right licenses.
A great example of complete attribution comes from the Imperial College London 2011 team (scroll down to the bottom of their team page to see attributions).
Here are some of the fields we recommend you have on this page. If there are other areas not listed below, but applicable to your team/project, please feel free to also list them on your attributions page. Please feel free to remove any areas not applicable to your project.

The wet lab portion of our research was conducted in Cornell’s Biomedical Engineering instructional lab run by Dr. Shivaun Archer. Dr. Archer provided us with lab facilities including a gel imaging station, microscopes, sterile hood, centrifuges, thermal-cyclers, and vortexes. Finally, she assisted with training of new members on laboratory equipment and advised the team on safety.
Professor David Wilson at Cornell generously provided our team with strains of E. coli containing the genes nixA, merT/merP, and GST-crs5.  Dr. Wilson and PhD Candidate from the Wilson Lab, Nathan Kruer-Zerhusen aided with project planning and were always available to answer questions pertaining to the strains from the Wilson Lab.
Dr. Nelson Hairston generously provided the team with information on the pollution at Onondaga Lake in Syracuse, NY.
Dr. Xiling Shen provided the team with advice throughout project planning and technical expertise on synthetic biology.  Additionally, Dr. Shen provided feedback on our presentation and wiki materials.
Metal quantification performed using ICP-AES was done by staff at Cornell's Nutrient Analysis Lab .  Sequencing was performed by staff at Cornell's Biotechnology Resource Center .
We'd also like to extend thanks to the many faculty and staff at Cornell including Rebecca Macdonald, Sue Bulkley, and Emily Tompkins who help us tremendously with team organization, relations, and business.
Thank You!

Eric Holmes
Beware of Eric Holmes, the fearless leader of CUGEM who grew up in the hood.  His disturbing character is immediately evident by his love for dead fish, as his latest kill is proudly displayed on his phone case.  He relentlessly pursues these innocent creatures in the hope of wiping them off the face of the earth.  Some call it fishing.  Watch out for his killer jokes; you may shoot yourself after hearing them ten times. These also usually involve fish.  In addition, he seems to enjoy trekking for days through miles of monotonous forest in order to …end up where he started.  He occasionally drags innocent freshmen along for the ride.  Despite all this, no one can dispute that Eric is a brilliant bioengineer, and so his curious hobbies have gone unquestioned.
Arun Chakravorty
Arun Chakravorty was found on the sandy shores of California, fully grown, in fetal position, borne from the sea foam of the great pacific. No one is sure how Arun came to be, but they have attributed his bubbly personality to the sea foam from whence he came, and his rich color to the sun, which he laid in for many days before he was discovered, giving him a tan that makes pale white girls cringe with jealousy. Arun, after rising from the gold sand on which he was found, then travelled the world, learning invaluable skills like cloning, a Capella, and FIFA. He needed strikers for his exclusively Argentinian FIFA team, so he travelled to Argentina and persuaded two men named Palacio and Milito to train and become world class soccer players. He then realized he could combine his three skills of cloning, singing, and FIFA, and become one of the most unique people to walk the face of the earth. He travelled to Ithaca, New York, and joined Cornell iGEM. Now, Arun spends his days cloning while simultaneously playing FIFA and singing songs of both praise and loathing (depending on the situation) for Milito and Palacio, with whom he plays as. Arun hates Palacio for growing a rat tail, but still enjoys his superior soccer capabilities. Arun’s hobbies include long walks on the beach and base jumping. He was also the inspiration for Tom Haverford, a character in the hit series, Parks and Recreation.
Samah Hoque
At first, Samah Hoque might seem like your ordinary iGem wet lab minion. But don’t be fooled by her innocent smile and kind demeanor. After graduating from Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, Samah turned down a job from the Ministry of Magic and came to Cornell University, where the eternal frozen tundra and endless days without sunlight constantly remind her of London. She spends plenty of time down in the basement lab space of Weill because it brings back her fondest childhood memories of living in a cramped cupboard under the stairs. With a single spell, Samah is able to bring bacteria to life by tricking them into thinking LB is delicious butterbeer. In dire lab situations, Samah must conjure her patronus, a rare form of Escherichia coli to ward away all evils from her precious bacterial colonies. When not in lab, Samah can be found dominating Quidditch games on the Arts Quad or reading about the dark arts in the library. 100 points to Samah Hoque for being iGem’s secret weapon.
Casey Zhang
Casey toils away in lab night and day, but only to feign a hardworking nature, as few are aware that this is because she prefers to remain discreet about her dwelling in the legendary interstitial space. (It has been heard that she unlocks it with a special pattern of light reflected by her carefully painted nails.) There is little known about the contents of this mysterious corner of our building, though we do suspect that it is filled with a surplus of baked goods, based on the delicious aroma wafting into the basement from a crack in its door. It is only fitting that the creator of these fine fragrances is none other than Casey, whose cream puffs will send you into the heaven of all food comas. But you must also be wary, for no one is quite certain of her recipes. The last iGEMer that recklessly wandered into the interstitial space reappeared weeks later as a half-eaten bag of dorito chips, so we are forced to wait for Casey to approach us with her offerings. Yet those, too, may be bewitched – any who cannot resist the goodness should fear transformation into a cuddly puppy. Unless you’re into that. Never fear, this adorable witch definitely won’t be able to eat you alive, though, because you would be long gone before she could finish chewing her first bite.
Kevin Hui
Entering Kevin Hui's kitchen is a life changing experience. Whether it's an oven-roasted chicken, apple-crumb pie, or fancy biscotti served with ginger cheesecake that you desire, Kevin can make it, and he will leave you craving for more. His discerning tongue makes team socials far more savory.   That said, this foodie from Long Island is also an aspiring assassin. If he's not busy cooking you dinner or wiping the floor in a Dota 2 match, he's probably plotting your murder. Each of his targets receives a uniquely catered ending. You better not get on his wrong side or the rice noodles you're enjoying may well be the end of you.  One way to hold on to your precious life is to never mess with this man's pizza. He will eat only the finest NYC thin crust pies and will find anything below his standards offensive. Anyone from Chicago would be well advised to keep their distance from this conniver.  If you are special enough to earn a spot on his hit list, instrumental music and Steam sales are known to pacify him. And if you somehow manage to survive, you'll find that this master chef, pizza connoisseur, and hobbyist assassin is an indispensable member of the Cornell iGEM team.
Gargi Ratnaparkhi
Gargi, standing at 3’7” and originally from the Shire, now resides exclusively in lab. She journeyed to Ithaca all the way from Middle Earth for the sole purpose of aiding Cornell iGEM. On any given day or time, you can find her staring angrily at the centrifuge while waiting for her minipreps or staring angrily at cells, trying to force them to transform with her mind. Although infamous for her skills in Ice Ball (patent pending) and her delicious cake, Gargi is less known for her not too terrible saxophone playing and her ability to crack boulders over her swimmer’s shoulders as though they were eggs. Although there is so much more to be said about Gargi Ratnaparki, this direct quote sums her up pretty well: “Five minipreps? I eat five minipreps for breakfast.”
Aaron Gittelman
In a land far, far away, where the grass stayed green and the water crystal blue, where minipreps worked and all was good, lived a young dragon-rider who soared the sky as carefree and lighthearted as the breeze that took him. Everywhere he flew over, music followed. The timbre and vibrancy of his voice, interwoven with the depth and complexity of his bass, spun even the simplest tunes into enchanting melodies. Oh how smooth and sweet they were! Everyone swooned at the mere echoes -- and did I mention his good looks? In the air, he and his dragon were one. But one day, his dragon fell ill. The deep emerald scales gave in to a pale sickly orange. For years, the rider searched for an answer, but what could it have been? Then, whispers came. ""Look within."" Hoping to hone his skills in the molecular world, he decided to join iGEM to first master the techniques of synthetic biology. Interviewers tried to stump him, but unbeknownst to the community, riders grew up around the art. The yellow tint in his eyes glowed as his intent gaze pierced through the dense air. His replies were as accurate as poised. By the end, he was not just any other newcomer. He was Aaron Gittelman – his name said it all.
Sharlene Dong
N Vrou van die raaisel, 'n vrou van raaisel. Ek sien jy dit durf waag om hierdie bio te vertaal haar donkerste geheime te ontsluit. Jy is gewaarsku.
Haar status: dodelik. Die P100 is haar wapen van keuse. Op 'n skaal van 1-4, Sharlene is Biosafety Vlak 10 Sy kan etanol steriliseer jou tenderest druk punte voor spuit haar vrag van dodelike gifstowwe. Wat deur die manier, is gesintetiseer gebruik om kennis oorgedra van antieke 5000-jarige Chinese alchemicy. Sy vlieg, nooit loop, het sy horlosies, nooit slaap. Jou enigste hoop op oorlewing is om haar te lei met 'n boeiende episode van Game of Thrones. Dit of blink voorwerpe.
Jy het dit so ver, jy is dapper.
Afrikaans filler text (or is it...), because Latin is too mainstream. Sharlene’s a fan.
Neema Patel
Neema Patel...how do I begin to explain Neema Patel? Neema Patel is magical. It's said that her legs are insured for $10,000. People say that she does bubble tea commercials in Taiwan. Her favorite movie is Mean Girls. Once she met Chris Pratt at an all-you-can-eat buffet. He told her to stop hoarding all the cupcakes. One time during Ice Ball (many times actually), she threw ice at me...it was not awesome.
Olya Spassibojko
No person is ever what they appear to be, and Olya Spazzabyolkajdksajfiodas is certainly no exception. Look under those perfectly placed spectacles and you’ll find an avid Anberlin advocate fluent in Ubbi Dubbi and prone to turning anything and everything turquoise. No one really knows how to spell her name, and people have learned it is better not to try. The brave souls who did were stripped of their sanity, never to recover. She has made a home out of the grand trees of Ithaca, and if you are lucky you might catch a glimpse of her masterfully navigating them. It is rumoured that from her birth in the distant Russian mountains, she attained her nimble skills during her tutalage under the continent's most notorious ninja. She will purr if you pet her, but petters beware – stay too long and you too will find yourself infected with a deep love of domestic felines and working with yeast. She climbs, she meows, she takes her bunny out on walks. She is Olya Spazzabyolkajdksajfiodas: resident cat lover and professional monkey.
Sara Gregg
SaraGregg is Cornell iGEM’s resident celebrity power couple rivaling the firepower of Brangelina and the sheer intrigue of Kimye. When she’s not using her gazelle-like endurance prowess to ski across Ithaca or run to dry lab meetings on Sunday mornings (a little extra sleep never hurts, right?) she’s using it to put in late night hours at the machine shop or to swoon over Korean dramas until 4am. A master of the 3D printer, she’ll print a plastic cake and simply stare at it, willing the tasty morsel she’s been craving into existence. This girl from small-town Ohio is a true city girl at heart, and all you Gregory Sarah’s out there better watch out for her; Sara is ready to produce her very own SynBio drama and the first SaraGreggGregSarah power couple to rule them all.
Steven Li
Steven Li is a super hero. His power of course, is: ________. Despite being quite elusive to even his closest of team members, who haven't seen him in months, Super-Stealthy-Steven can be recognized by his iconic wooden cross necklace, from which he draws his power. Rumored to be a demigod born from the Western God Franisco-San Francisco to you- He has decided to leave his home, many leagues away, to solve the many crimes of current Eastern society the main one being: selfies. In a private interview, to which he never appeared, it is documented that Steven is diligently working on destroying the power of selfies by photo-bombing each and every one. Because of the plethera of selfies being taken in our day and age, Steven is rather busy and doesn't stay in one place for very long. So if you haven't seen Steven in awhile, don't worry he is off being the grand super hero that he is!
Joseph Fridman
The year was 1989. Even as the Cold War raged on, the USSR and the ideology it represented were in their death throes. In an act of desperation, the Politburo sought to develop a new propaganda apparatus, hoping that by effectively spreading pro-Soviet sentiment worldwide support for the enfeebled superpower would increase, and the tides would turn. To that end, Joseph Fridman was created. With a disarming kindness and an extraordinary intellect, he was capable of convincing anyone whom he spoke to that the path to prosperity was painted red. After a battery of evaluations, Fridman was sent to America with the goal of neutralizing it as an adversary to communism. However, upon arrival in the US, he was staggered by the wealth and majesty of the republic. After thinking it through, he decided to defect to the capitalist West. Without his assistance, the Soviet empire soon collapsed. Now an American citizen, the former sleeper agent has settled down, studying psychology at Cornell University (with the obvious purpose of honing his power of persuasion) and working to convince the population of Ithaca of the preeminence of CUGEM.
Ryan Ashley
There are rumors. People say things – see things – around our labs. Blonde-haired apparitions float in and out of the corners of our eyes. Visions of a gentle smile flash through team members’ minds. Perfect gels appear on the countertop, and despite the immaculate labeling, no one knows who ran them. One team member, who wishes to remain anonymous, says that on one quiet lonely afternoon as he walked by one of the sinks, he noticed it was dirty, caked with mud and beakers strewn about. Since he was the only one in the lab at the time, he decided to clean it up, but when he turned to look at the sink again, it was completely cleaned! There is agreement among the team that something … else lurks in our workspace. We’ve taken to calling our mysterious helper “Ryan” (the name just seemed to fit). We don’t know what it is or what it wants, but we do know our project wouldn’t be half as well done without it.
Rishabh Singh
They speak of a man learned beyond all others, unbound by mortal flesh.  For eons, he wandered this plane, seeking new pleasures to satisfy his ageless conscience.  Nothing was outside his grasp.  In his wake, nations fell, civilizations flourished, and as always, the women swooned.  Gradually, through the thousands of millennia, this man’s true name of power was lost to the shifting sands of time.  But, word among the people speak of a him currently residing in Cornell University, assuming the identity of “Rishabh”, though veterans of the field know this is simply one of the many guises he has chosen.  He currently dedicates himself to the Cornell iGEM team, lending an eternity of knowledge to this humble project team.    When he is not gracing his presence in the iGEM lab space, he prefers the quiet sanctity of the indoors, proving himself among the best in the FPS gaming, his years as a skilled military tactician rendering his enemies little more than a mob of confused toddlers.  Legend also speaks of his legendary pie making skills, though few live to tell the tale of a pie of such high caliber, as the sheer ecstasy of tasting one of these legendary morsels causes the human body to permanently cease function (in some parts of the world, death in such a way is considered an honorable one).   This biography serves as more than just a record, it is a herald, a warning for times to come.  The one named Rishabh is powerful beyond measure, though his current form may be unassuming.  Woe to those that stand in his way, as he is not known to be merciful.  The last recorded time his wrath was incurred, the Black Death occurred.  Not even the very best of heroes can even dream of facing his final form, which is also known to be incredible sassy.  So beware, beware to all those who hope to undermine his efforts.  In even the most secretive of moments, do not forget.   He won’t.
Ritvik Sarkar
What is the Ritvik? I'm glad you asked. Ritvik used to be our team's secret secret nonlethal weapon, until a series of not completely unrelated explosions and earthquakes alerted national media to its existence. Ritvik is the original prototype for our project, with its 20 micron filter hair outperforming all competition. We are still struggling to develop a successor that has even half the ability to make wet things into dry things. Capable of building models to ensure our team's success as well as other smaller ventures such as hostile takeover of midwestern states, Ritvik is an essential component of our team. Without its capabilities as a replacement pump system, we would be incapable of surmounting the one foot of head that stalls our team's inevitable victory.
Swati Sureka
You'd remember when you first met her, in lab. It's pretty striking at first: She [Swati] sits motionless, like a spider in the centre of its web, but that web has a thousand radiations, and she knows well every quiver of each of them. Beakers, notebooks, laptops, disembodied voices, bits and pieces of cardboard, flora and fauna of the like that have never been seen before on Planet Earth - all circle her in the air, flying around like so many transporters, enzymes, and cellular automata. She does little herself. She only plans. But her agents are numerous and splendidly organised. Is there research to be done, a paper to be abstracted, we will say, a block of DNA to be characterized, a project to be undertaken - the word is passed to the SWATi Team, the matter is organised and carried out. And if that all sounds a little intimidating, have no fear: Swati is sworn by oath to the Old Gods and the New to defend, advance, and justify through feats of meaningful scientific accomplishment the existence of human life. Just make sure you don't forget to pay your social dues...
George Danias
George Danias?
Many have dreamt and heard his name
Only to find themselves shocked and maimed
By his unputdownable creativity,
Ingenuity and alacrity,
His inventions rise from ground
Like his infinite wisdom that always astounds
His mechanical chess pieces guard his palace
Where he makes cells as radiant as the aurora borealis
Although only a part of the team since this year
Everyone seems to notice when he disappears
So treasure his presence, for he’s only nice
When you’re not one of his lab mice
Many wonder why he has chosen to impact our lives,
But to that question, he chooses to derive
A massive differential equation
Showcasing why it is the best and most valuable occasion
He often is staring at the sky
Not pondering when, where, or why,
But deciding the fate of planets and stars
Like a couple billion years ago, he decided on mars.
So in fact he didn’t apply to the team
But decided it would be good for our self-esteem
Tina Su
Date a girl who reads. Find her in a cozy coffee shop, Stella's, tucked behind the fall foliage in the bustle of Cornell Collegetown. Wherever you find her, she'll be smiling, making sure it lingers even when people talking to her look away. Kiss her in the rain under the glow of a streetlamp because you saw it in a film. Remark at its huge significance. Date a girl who reads because she is a storyteller. You with Hemingway, Nabokov and Austen, in the library, on the metro platform at nine and three-quarters, in the corner cafe, perched on the window of your room. You, who makes my life so difficult.
Neil Chitrao
Deep beneath the Alamogordo testing range, the United States planned their most ambitious project yet.  So shrouded in secrecy was this project, not even the President of the United States was aware of its undertaking.  It was to be a grand culmination of centuries of research, dwarfing even the scale of the Manhattan Project.  The premise was simple: to create a humanoid embodiment of the spirit of American patriotism.  Nicknamed the N.E.I.L., or Nationalistically Empowered Intelligent Lifeform, he was to be an exemplar of the American standard and ingenuity.  Unfortunately he was too modern for his time, and the team of scientists, fearing for another “Cold War” style confrontation, locked N.E.I.L. in stasis until the time was right to reintroduce him to American society.
That time is now.
Numerous field reports have triangulated his position at Cornell University, where he has subtly placed himself within Cornell’s iGEM team.  Though he tries to mask his identity, his designs are unmistakable.  He is fueled by twin-powered nuclear fission reactors, rendering sleep unnecessary, explaining the numerous hours he has been sighted in the lab working on inhuman hours of sleep.  It is also nigh impossible to be in his presence without the word “America” being uttered at least once, a remnant of his circuitry from the highly patriotic wartime years.  Delving further into conversation, you will find a vast database of knowledge of weaponry and military aircraft, an unsurprising find due to his production during the 1940s.  Despite his advanced systems, he bides his time, remaining in his low-profile state until the time arises to take up arms to defend the American ideal once more.
Michelle Zhang
Now for Michelle there’s little I can say:
Her skill is matched by none; her scheming eyes
Do always flit betwixt pipettes, with ne’er
A microliter out of place. Oh my!
Above the busy humming of our lair,
Amidst the bustling team, her focus grows;
Her data gathers, as if out of air.
Graphs pop on screen; a smile begins to show.
Fluorescent lights now flicker, silence falls
Upon the lab… we just make out the clicks
Of Eppendorf tubes popping. Softly call,
“Who’s there?” Ms. Zhang emerges, oh so slick.
What more can I say of this wondrous fiend?
Her mysteries abound; ‘tis all I’ve gleaned.
Jonlin Chen
The shining light of the grand Lighthouse of Alexandria pierced through the ebony Arabian night, guiding the royal ships of King Ptolemy II Philadelphus to the safety of the Pharos shore. After departing the Eastern Desert with crates of spices, linen, and gold, Egyptian sailors bowed to the mercy of the Great Sea and endured Her thrashing waves and whipping rain on their way home. The darkness often consumed faith in reaching Great Alexandria, that is until the fire-burning Lighthouse parted the night sky and illuminated the secure Nile Delta and familiar shores. Jonlin Chen, although human and not 120 meters tall, is Cornell iGEM's guiding light and source of all hope during times of darkness. While we, less-skilled iGEM members, are literally drowning in incomplete minipreps and restriction digests and utterly clueless on where to begin, Jonlin is the one person we can count on to show us the way. Whether it is a frantic phone call in the morning before class or a 2am Groupme message of desperation, Jonlin is always ready to help. Her fire-burning passion for bioengineering and iGEM fuels our team and shines through the often gloomy labspace during exam weeks and consecutive weeks of unsuccessful transformations, and is an inspiration to us all.
Grace Livermore
Beyond the isles of man, in the shaded grove where the heavens gently caress the Earth sits the very heart of nature itself.  It is here that the land retains its pristine landscape, unfettered and untainted by the influences of mankind’s expansion.  The very natural order was under siege, and Mother Nature required a vanguard to fight on her behalf.  Using primitive arcane energies that shaped the Earth itself, the very essence of nature was harnessed, coalescing into a single being.  Thus, Grace came into being, so aptly named to be the saving grace of nature’s purity.
But where to start?  The damage done is great, but like all great heroes, small steps come before giant bounds, and Grace knew the perfect place to start.  She now works tirelessly on Cornell’s iGEM team, conducting research that can rectify the contamination that grips this planet.  Despite all her continuing dedication to the team, she never fails to forget the roots from which she came.  An avid rock climber, she enjoys scaling the formidable walls to attune herself with the Earth.  She is also learned in song and dance, particularly the style of Bhangra, for which she has joined Cornell’s Bhangra team and has had much success.  But above all, she is a defender of nature; a hero to us all.
Jeffrey Ly
From the moment Jeffrey was born, he knew he was destined to join the Cornell iGEM team. Two years later, he was successfully recruited. His youth isn't all drawback: his energy rivals that of his best friend and mentor, the energizer bunny, and it allows him to be more on top of things than most people. It has also earned him a place on the team as director of all things requiring enthusiasm. His other responsibilities include optimizing his teammates' vacation schedules and cheering up cells recovering from transformation. You may say he's a dreamer, but he is the only one.  Isn't he cool?
Tim Abbott
Tim Abbott was the original cybernetic organism from which James Cameron based the terminator upon. He was sent back in time from a post-apocalyptic future in an effort to protect members of the Cornell iGEM team which would go on to design a novel metal sequestration fiber reactor. Once the war would break out between artificially intelligent machines and humans, humans would hold their own for a surprising amount of time. But their greatest downfall would come when the machines contaminated all the world’s water supplies with heavy metals. By successfully aiding the 2014 iGEM team in completing their metal sequestration fiber reactor, Tim effectively has ensured the future of all of mankind.
Prashant Sharma
In a spectacular laboratory experiment (similar to the one that created the Powerpuff girls), researchers managed to combine the wisdom of a great redwood tree with the humor and wit of Kanye West to produce the artist formerly known as Prince, currently known as Prashant “Shawn” Sharma.  As a senior member of Cornell iGEM, Shawn imparts his vast stores of worldly knowledge onto the ‘youngins, sometimes dropping some advice on a sick double clutch fadeaway he saw Kobe perform once, other times, schooling teammates on the intricacies of synthetic biology.  As a chemistry/biology double major, Shawn is clearly a mad-man and should not be approached under any circumstances, unless you come bearing naval oranges, his favorite fruit.  Perhaps one of the more intriguing facts about Shawn is that every car model with an “S” in the name is named in honor of Shawn, including the Toyota Corolla S, the Tesla Model S, and obviously the Mercedes S Class.
Rebecca Chew
She's no bird, not an airplane...she's Rebecca Chew, the super ChemE that dabbles in modeling, dry lab, and wet lab!  One day she's in goggles, another creating insane models, either way, nothing can move forward without her.  How does she do all this? Two words: BUBBLE TEA.  The consumption of glucose and caffeine molecules is her secret potion.  One sip of this delightful beverage is enough for her to become a machine.
Nupur Bhatt
Thousands of years ago, nature spirits and humans coexisted as one. They walked the ground we walked on. They lived in the valleys we lived in. Until humans began harming their homes, their families. That was when gods split their world with ours. The Night of Crystal Rift. We only know about Karuna from ancient scriptures, this alternate dimension on Earth. It is said the spirits still walk the ground we walk on, but we don't see them. We don't hear them. Then two decades ago, the gods decided to give humans a second chance. Scyllarus. That's what they call her. When she was born into Karuna, sages on Earth saw the dark night glow. An orange aurora streaked the sky. She is the daughter of the wild, destined to synthesize the bridge between the human world and the spiritual world. The day she stepped into the human world, she took the name of Nupur. Her spiritual powers took form in tangible human abilities. Her strong base notes. Her swift coding skills. Her quiet demeanor hides her true powers, but she is observing...finding ways to mend the past.
Mac Sennett
He doesn’t always operate heavy machinery, but when he does, the finger of God once again touches the earth through his work. He once purposefully maligned one of his creations, just to see what failure felt like. After he drove his car off the lot, the value increased. He once got a compliment on his appearance from his reflection. Raw materials he uses and BioBricks assemble themselves for him. Police frequently pull him over to ask for his autograph. He makes all cloning strategies succeed, even GoldenGate. The “College of Sennett” was founded at Cornell because he asked them to. He has taught old dogs every trick in the book, even the ones that aren’t written. Each night, the Sandman dreams of Mac.
Christine Soong
Having retired from saving the world as the country’s top CIA agent, Christine returned to scout for potential successors. While not training her prodigies, she casually works on the circuitry to control our top secret fiber reactor. Her ultimate goal in life is to adopt 101 Dalmatians to accompany her on her long runs and kayaking trips!
Rafael Martinez
Now this is a story all about how Rafa’s life got flipped – turned upside down And I’d like to take a minute just sit right there I’ll tell you how he became a prince and a billionaire A town called Ithaca’s where he stayed Inside Milstein is where he spent most of his days Drawin’ and plottin’ relaxin’ all cool And all Building some dragons outside of the school When a couple of guys, who were up to some good Started building towers in the neighborhood He got a great little job and a title with flair Now he’s master architect he makes his projects with care
Erica Alonzo
In a world oppressed by the bland and mundane, where creativity is stifled in the wink of an eye. Where uniqueness is punishable by death. Societies have all devolved into nothing but brainless servants of The Man, and there is only one person who can stop them. Join Erica, an unlikely heroine, as she utilizes her wit, charm and sass to bring an end to The Legion of Tropes and their dastardly (albeit trite) plans of enslaving the human race. One woman will help bring the light of excitement back into this dismal planet. This Fall, prepare to get your creative juices flowing in 'Dee Zine: And The Legion of Tropes.'

About Us
The 2014 UT Austin iGEM team featured a mix of new and returning team members. While we had two returning undergraduates, Kate and Jordan, the rest of the team was new. Two of our new students, Ella and Nathan, had never even worked in a lab before. The team used our caffeinated coli project in March 2014 to get everyone acquainted with the basic techniques the team would use throughout the coming year. New team members also took or sat in on Prof. Barrick's CH391L Synthetic Biology course for an introduction to different types of genetic parts, synbio methods, and ethical issues.
All five undergraduates worked steadily during the summer on our two main projects and the interlab study, learning a number of techniques and generating some very nice data.  During the fall, the team has been wrapping up experiments and finishing up the data assessment, while also making our presentation and team wiki.

Undergraduates
Alejandro ""Alex"" Gutierrez
I am a third-year undergraduate neurobiology major, and a new member of the iGEM team. Before joining iGEM, I did research in creating metal nanoparticles to use as catalysts. Besides doing research, I also enjoy cooking, reading, and sleeping.
Jordan Monk
I'm a senior cell & molecular biology major returning from last year's iGEM team. I plan to keep doing this molecular biology thing for a living because I haven't figured out yet how little money there is to be made. I'm probably in lab as you're reading this.
Catherine ""Kate"" Mortensen
A returning member from the 2013 iGEM team and biochemistry major. I believe synthetic biology is truly fascinating and has the potential to make positive impact on society. I'm extremely grateful for my team this year but especially for my advisors who have shown relentless patience, generosity, and guidance. I plan to continue my education in biochemistry and synthetic biology and hope to make a stamp in the world.
Nathan Shin
I'm a third year microbiology major at the greatest university in the entire world. Besides my immense love for all things iGEM, I also enjoy sleeping, playing tennis, and binge watching Netflix. And I also enjoy long walks on the beach.
Ella Watkins
I am third year at the University of Texas, and striving to earn my Bachelors of Science in Biology. This summer has been such a whirlwind of amazing learning and hands on experience. I am so grateful to have been given the opportunity to participate on the iGEM team. I remember my first successful PCR as if it was only 5 months ago… oh wait, it was.
A perfect view from our office this year. The eyes of Texas were upon us! Hook em!!

iGEM Team attributions page
Each team must clearly attribute work done by the student team members on this page.  The team must distinguish work done by the students from work done by others, including the host labs, advisors, instructors, and individuals not on the team roster.
Why do we have this requirement?
Attribution Template
We have this requirement to help the judges know what you did yourselves and what you had help with. We don't mind if you get help with difficult or complex techniques, just be sure to report the work your team did and the work that was done by others.
For example, you might choose to work with an animal model during your project. Working with animals requires getting a license and applying far in advance to conduct certain experiments in many countries. This is something that is difficult to achieve during the course of a summer, but much easier if you can work with a postdoc or PI who has the right licenses.
A great example of complete attribution comes from the Imperial College London 2011 team (scroll down to the bottom of their team page to see attributions).
Here are some of the fields we recommend you have on this page. If there are other areas not listed below, but applicable to your team/project, please feel free to also list them on your attributions page. Please feel free to remove any areas not applicable to your project.
General Support
Project support and advice
Fundraising help and advice
Lab support
Difficult technique support
Project advisor support
Wiki support
Presentation coaching
Policy & Practices support
Thanks and acknowledgements for all other people involved in helping make a successful iGEM team.

A core concept of iGEM is the collaboration in an interdisciplinary student team. Accordingly, students of different age, gender and field of study came together to found our team in Aachen, in order to realize our project with joint forces and enthusiasm for the overall goal. Working closely together, we therefore not only have the chance to learn from each other, but also to excel ourselves. Using our collective creativity and common responsibility, we will create something special in order to make our contribution to synthetic biology.

Dr.-Ing. Suresh Sudarsan
I'm working as a post-doc with Prof. Blank at RWTH Aachen University. In my Ph.D. I worked under the guidance of Prof. Andreas Schmid (2008-2012) at TU Dortmund, and Prof. Matthias Reuss (2009-2011) at the University of Stuttgart, with a focus on elucidating the link between the central and aromatic metabolism of P. putida using a systems biology approach.
I'm fascinated about understanding the collective behavior of microorganisms and their metabolic potential in different niches. In my research, I use tools in metabolic engineering & systems biology such as metabolomics, fast sampling, kinetic/dynamic modeling and metabolic flux analysis.
In iGEM, I enjoy working with a group of young scientists from Aachen to achieve our common goal of detecting Pseudomonas aeruginosa on hard surfaces. Besides science, I try to get myself involved in adventurous sports...but honestly... I just like to relax my day with a delicious meal and a good sci-fi movie!
Dr. rer. nat. Ljubica Vojcic
I am working as a Subgroup Leader in Prof. Schwaneberg research group at the Institute of Biotechnology, RWTH Aachen.  The research area of the Schwaneberg group focuses on directed protein evolution by developing novel methods for generating diversity at the gene level, analyzing consequences of mutational biases on the protein level and developing novel high-throughput screening systems that will lead to improved biocatalysts for prominent applications in industry. In particular, my core expertise is development of high throughput screening systems for different enzyme classes in order to redefine the screening step no longer as bottleneck in directed evolution.
In iGEM, I enjoyed very much to work with highly motivated and ambitious young scientists from RWTH Aachen University. I truly believe that our collaboration has just started and that we will enjoy jointly solving the scientific challenges in the near future.
Instructors
Prof. Dr.-Ing. Lars M. Blank
RWTH Institute for Applied Microbiology (iAMB)
Prof. Blank focuses his research on fundamental and applied aspects of microbial metabolism. Of specific interest is the interaction between the metabolic network and the introduced genetic and environmental perturbations. The research on in silico/in vivo metabolic network operations is aimed at a deeper understanding of cell function, with the ultimate goal of rational cell engineering.
In his teaching, Prof. Blank focuses on the integration of biological concepts with the tools from bioinformatics and engineering. He believes that a sound knowledge base in life sciences is the key for creative and thus successful work in the areas of Metabolic Engineering and Synthetic Biology. Read more about Prof. Blank's work on the iAMB's website .
Prof. Dr. Wolfgang Wiechert
Forschungszentrum Jülich, Institute of Bio- and Geosciences (IGB-1)
Prof. Wiechert's main area of work lies within the field of applied systems bio(techno)logy of microorganisms with a special focus on methodological developments for quantitative biology. Characteristics of his research work are a close integration of experimental and theoretical work within multi disciplinary projects. As the head of the Systems Biotechnology research division at Forschungszentrum Jülich, he is developing methods for quantitative metabolomics, fluxomics and proteomics including model based mathematical methods for experimental design, parameter estimation, and process optimization in biotechnological systems. Future work will also incorporate micro fluidic methods for single cell analysis. In general, all research results are used to drive forward the process of gaining knowledge in the course of an iterative improvement of industrial production systems. This proceeds in close cooperation of all working groups at the IBG-1. Together with industrial partners also diverse examples from industry are investigated and further developed. Read more about Prof. Wiechert's work on the IBG-1 website .
Prof. Dr. Ulrich Schwaneberg
RWTH Institute for Biotechnology, Leibniz Institute for Interactive Materials (DWI)
The Schwaneberg Group seeks to be at the research frontier in the interdisciplinary field of directed protein evolution by developing novel methods for generating diversity at the gene level, analyzing consequence of mutational biases on the protein level and developing novel high-throughput screening systems that will ultimately lead to tailored-biocatalysts for significant applications in industry. They train students in the cutting edge technologies of laboratory evolution, biocatalyst engineering and high throughput screening methodologies. The Schwaneberg Group believes in integrating fundamental principles of protein design with environmental awareness in their research and seeks to promote international scientific collaborations. Read more about Prof. Schwaneberg and his work on the Schwaneberg Group's website .

iGEM Team attributions page
Each team must clearly attribute work done by the student team members on this page.  The team must distinguish work done by the students from work done by others, including the host labs, advisors, instructors, and individuals not on the team roster.
Why do we have this requirement?
Attribution Template
We have this requirement to help the judges know what you did yourselves and what you had help with. We don't mind if you get help with difficult or complex techniques, just be sure to report the work your team did and the work that was done by others.
For example, you might choose to work with an animal model during your project. Working with animals requires getting a license and applying far in advance to conduct certain experiments in many countries. This is something that is difficult to achieve during the course of a summer, but much easier if you can work with a postdoc or PI who has the right licenses.
A great example of complete attribution comes from the Imperial College London 2011 team (scroll down to the bottom of their team page to see attributions).
Here are some of the fields we recommend you have on this page. If there are other areas not listed below, but applicable to your team/project, please feel free to also list them on your attributions page. Please feel free to remove any areas not applicable to your project.

She is also pursuing a minor in Microbiology.  iGEM is Emily's first research experience of her undergraduate career, but she hopes to continue working in a lab for her remaining two years.  Outside of class Emily is very involved in Penn State's Dance Marathon, known as THON.  She has been a part of a committee, helping to run security all of THON weekend, and is also an active member of a TETRA, a special interest THON organization.  Emily serves as a leader for the NEXUS club which mentors new and transfer students in the Eberly College of Science at Penn State.  When Emily isn't busy with classes or clubs, you can find her downtown at a local dance studio where she continues to pursue her favorite childhood hobby.  After graduation, Emily would like to further her education and work in a research lab.  She plans to remain in the State College or Greater Pittsburgh area as she considers both of these places home.
Sam is going into his senior year studying Chemical Engineering. Additionally, he is pursuing a minor in music performance and is an active member of the Penn State Clarinet Studio. He continues to develop his academic skills throughout the year by conducting research in the metabolic and genetic engineering lab under the direction of Dr. Howard Salis. He had his first exposure to research  last summer and was trained in one of the Four Diamonds Research Labs in Hershey headed by Dr. Sinisa Dovat. This summer, he is a curriculum mentor for Penn State’s Science U, which is a series of camps that members of all different departments of the university have an opportunity to design a weeklong curriculum for grades 2-12 to help inspire lifelong learning.  He is currently serving as the Pride Events Director for Penn State Homecoming 2014 and has recently been appointed as the Special Events –Event Management Director for the Special Interest Association for the 2014-2015 school year.

General Support
Dr. Howard Salis and Dr. Tom Richard were our iGEM coordinators and were instrumental in development of the big ideas for our projects as well as with troubleshooting specific experiments.
Project Support and Advice
Chiam Yu Ng (graduate student) was an outstanding mentor, helping us to learn design strategies and develop a cloning plan to set our project into motion. When we ran into problems with cloning, Chiam Yu was very patient and helped us to optimize our experimental processes.
Another great asset to our project was Tian Tian (graduate student). Because of her desk’s proximity to Clay’s, she skillfully answered an almost constant stream of questions - on everything from optimizing PCR protocols to tips for plasmid prep.
Manish Kushwaha (post-doc), Iman Farasat (graduate student), Long Chen (graduate student) and Amin Espah Borujeni (graduate student) all provided critical tips for improving our cloning strategy, as well as assistance developing our programs to optimize the GFPs.
Iman Farasat and Dr. Salis were a big help to the Biodetoxification project. Iman assisted us with forming an experimental plan and ordering primers for Gibson Chew-Back Annealing Assembly. They both taught us how to perform a CBA and homologous recombination and offered advice during our project troubleshooting. Tian Tian, Chiam Yu Ng, Long Chen, Manish Kushwaha and Amin Espah Borujeni answered our random questions.
Fundraising Help and Advice
Dr. Tom Richard and Dr. Howard Salis took on the burden of finding funding for the undergrads, and we are sincerely thankful for their work.
Lab Support
We are very appreciative of being able to use Dr. Salis’s Lab space and materials. Iman and Chiam Yu were crucial in the wet-lab success of both projects.
Difficult Technique Support
When we experienced problems with a tricky inverse PCR, Chiam Yu helped us to uncover a critical error in one of our primers. Designing an RBS library with the constraints that were present in our constructs was very difficult and Iman helped us to understand and solve this problem.  Iman taught the Biodetoxification group the protocol for Gibson CBA and homologous recombination. Dr. Salis provided modifications to the protocol using the Lambda Red Recombinase plasmid.
Wiki Support
Chiam Yu was helpful with advice. Ashlee spent a lot of time surfing the internet and found tutorials and resources for html and CSS. None of us have experience with creating a website prior to iGEM so it was quite a daunting task.
Presentation Coaching
Dr. Howard Salis and Dr. Tom Richard both improved our presentation skills.
Kay Dimarco (staff) helped us to find activity kits from the previous iGEM team, which we ended up reinventing but were a source of inspiration for our presentation to the science teachers and the ScienceU students. Matt Johnson (staff) and Leah Bug (staff) gave us advice on our NewBio Teachers presentation for the Center for Science and the Schools.
Policy and Practices Support
Dr. Tom Richard helped us to refine and implement our ideas for human practices topics.
Thanks and Acknowledgements
Thank you to everyone in the Salis lab, Dr. Salis, and Dr. Richard for supporting us along the way.

Talk and poster at the jamboree. And everything else that concerns the perception of our project. The presentation group work ceaselessly to show the world, in the best light, what we've done.
Slide and Device Producing
KUAN-CHUN LAN made the stylish slides. He always modified the slides after every presentation practice. GUANG-JYUN WANG designed and built the amazing capturing device.
Initially, our team was divided into three groups for paper discussion and experiments. We hoped we could use these simple group division to make our teammates learn how to complete our teamwork.
One thing special about our team is that over 90% of us is freshmen. This made our team more creative but also presented many difficulties due to our relative lack of professional knowledge and training. Fortunately, we have many advisers to help us conquer these difficulties. They not only teach us the basic concepts and knowledge of iGEM, but they also let us think and try instead of doing the work for us. Therefore, our entire project is completed by our team members themselves with our instructors and advisers providing their opinions.
After a few months, we divided our team into experiment group, wiki group, art group, and presentation group in hopes of making everyone do what they do best.

iGEM Team attributions page
Each team must clearly attribute work done by the student team members on this page.  The team must distinguish work done by the students from work done by others, including the host labs, advisors, instructors, and individuals not on the team roster.
Why do we have this requirement?
Attribution Template
We have this requirement to help the judges know what you did yourselves and what you had help with. We don't mind if you get help with difficult or complex techniques, just be sure to report the work your team did and the work that was done by others.
For example, you might choose to work with an animal model during your project. Working with animals requires getting a license and applying far in advance to conduct certain experiments in many countries. This is something that is difficult to achieve during the course of a summer, but much easier if you can work with a postdoc or PI who has the right licenses.
A great example of complete attribution comes from the Imperial College London 2011 team (scroll down to the bottom of their team page to see attributions).
Here are some of the fields we recommend you have on this page. If there are other areas not listed below, but applicable to your team/project, please feel free to also list them on your attributions page. Please feel free to remove any areas not applicable to your project.

iGEM Team attributions page
Each team must clearly attribute work done by the student team members on this page.  The team must distinguish work done by the students from work done by others, including the host labs, advisors, instructors, and individuals not on the team roster.
Why do we have this requirement?
Attribution Template
We have this requirement to help the judges know what you did yourselves and what you had help with. We don't mind if you get help with difficult or complex techniques, just be sure to report the work your team did and the work that was done by others.
For example, you might choose to work with an animal model during your project. Working with animals requires getting a license and applying far in advance to conduct certain experiments in many countries. This is something that is difficult to achieve during the course of a summer, but much easier if you can work with a postdoc or PI who has the right licenses.
A great example of complete attribution comes from the Imperial College London 2011 team (scroll down to the bottom of their team page to see attributions).
Here are some of the fields we recommend you have on this page. If there are other areas not listed below, but applicable to your team/project, please feel free to also list them on your attributions page. Please feel free to remove any areas not applicable to your project.

The Exclusive Interview of the Founding Captain of Jilin University’s iGEM Team
In our last interview, we have introduced the founding captain of iGEM SCUT team——Zhang  Junjie to you. This time, I’m going to introduce you the founding captain of Jilin University’s IGEM team, Han jia, a blossoming man of science who have always wanted to become a Public educator. In the following passage I will share you why he wants to become an educator, what he has done to contribute to the dynamic synthetic biology as well as his experience of importing IGEM to his university and how he forged his own team.
The meeting lasting 2 days was organized by HZAU, WHU and HUST iGEM teams. The contents consisted of three main parts: senior iGEMers’ reports, project presentation by each team, and the discussion of debugs in experiments. On the morning of 23th  August, Dr. Tang Jun, the professor of HZAU participated in the opening ceremony and gave a welcoming speech. Then we watched the video made by the chairman iGEM Head Quarters specially for the meeting. It was really helpful and wonderful. After the opening ceremony, the seniors Zhang Haoqian and Liu Yang coming from Peking University and Ocean University of China gave us two important speeches, sharing their abundant experience about iGEM. It really paid to learn.
1. The growth process of Han
HanJia began reading a lot of educational books, such as pedagogical psychology at a young age, and became interested in pedagogy. Afterwards he started to become an enthusiast on studying the educational joint projects，and he even involved in many fields of study including economics，ethnics ，psychology, philosophy, management, arts, and medicine, this reading process of absorbing various aspects of knowledge has greatly enriched his study of the life science. When Hanjia first went to the university, he started to be active in child education & community services together with his like-minded friends, and from then on, he had set his heart on a career in the cause of education. Although he gave up his dream career temporarily for many reasons afterwards, he learned great deal from this practices and he indeed made a lot of practical and useful proposals to his old school : Jilin University and Shenyang Pharmaceutical University. To conclude，he is a  man with kindness，conscience and public spirits，and he dares to face any challenge and tries his best to overcame them uitimately.
2. Academic career
The present goal of Han is to become a researcher of Beijing Life Science Research Center.And he had already done researches in the labs of Jilin University for 2 years and a half as an exchange student of Joint training of Life Science College of Jilin University. During that time, he not only achieved many challenging academic studies, but also joined substantial practical activities. In Dec. 2011, he became a researcher of the Key Laboratory of Ministry of education Jilin University molecular enzyme engineering, and joined the ""Jilin University undergraduate innovation experiment research"" as a project leader. Then he studied in Zhang Zuoming’ project called Molecular cloning and characterization of cellulose CpCel9 and its mutants in Enzyme engineering 204 which then enriched his knowledge about Enzyme engineering. He is also a cure researcher of the academic department of the College of life science as well as the school committee of science and technology association propaganda department director who helped to hold ""Jilin University"" Challenge Cup ""Gold Award"", ""team six campus cup"" Impulse Cup ""campus marketing competition"" and ""Jilin University"" top ten students selection”. What’s more he also managed to hold the “meeting of exchange of learning in School of Biology”, “meeting of exchange of learning between Research and Undergraduates” and many other academic activities.
After his exchange experience, he went back to Shenyang Pharmaceutical University to continue to do other science researches. And he joined in the Lab of Xi Huanzhang to study Joint related technology transfer gene transfer method and the research of gene function, which grew his interest in Aminoglycoside antibiotics combinatorial biosynthesis related with microbial agents and synthetic biology research.
3. Liking for iGEM
During the talk with team leader Mr.Han, we found that it is even more accidental comparing to Mr.Zhang who was introduced last time.
Mr Han told us that it is the movie"" there we were"" arouse his interest in Peking university and the school life there. Then he started going through lots of videos about there. By chance, he found the video about the iGEM team in Peking university. From then, the little seed was growing in his heart , which bring him the dream that one day he would has his own team taking this top competition in biology filed. During his year 2. He joined the lecture which was given by the researcher, Li Yan from the institute of microbiology as well as the summer camp in Shanghai Jiaotong university which are all quite relevant to iGEM. All of these brought him more and more close to synthetic biology ,and laying the foundation of establish the iGEM team here.
Through indefatigable effort of university, teachers and students, the IGEM team from the Jilin University is formally launched on 2014. The team is led by Wu Yongge subdecanal, Mr. Liu Chengbo, Mr. Gao Chaohui, Mr. Jiang Yiqun and Ms. Wu hui as the co - director of the team, Han Jia and Du Bochuan as the team leader, Song Guangyuan and other sophomores as principal members，and around other 20 students from the freshmen to seniors who are interested on the scientific research join the team. Then this team is named as Jilin-China as suggested by the organising committee; meanwhile, they jointly create the IGEM China Community and Synbiclub together with other colleges, to facilitate further scholarly communication exchanges.
（Pic 1 Han Jia and his instructor, Prof. Teng）
Finally, after October ,2013,  the iGEM team from Nanjing university who won the gold prize and entered the international competition came to Jilin university to introduce the iGEM.  At that time, Mr Han has already in his final year . When he hear this news, he decided to back Changchun right away , starting to form the first iGEM team for his mother school -- Jilin university .
When he came back to school,  he started pushing this issue with his schoolmates and friend  Du Bochuan. They introduced iGEM to junior students during the college welcome party and also brought this news to the deputy dean professor Teng Rongli.  Prof. Teng  gave great support and encouraged them to go further. Step by step, the dream of iGEM team has become more clear and workable. Meanwhile, Mr Han became more  confident to build iGEM team in Jilin university.
At the present time, they has entered a tense phase of experimental stages, everything are new, they come up against a great deal of resistance in dealing with many problems, but they always try their best to overcome all the difficulties. The main project for the IGEM team is regarding the degradation of algae toxins technology in water to reduce the pollution and purify the environment. Here, we would like to express our great gratitude to the team leader Mr. Hanjia for his help on the interview, and we wish that his team will perform well in the coming competition this year.

Introdution
This year our project is concerned with outer membrane and matrix of mitochondria and considering about the amount of work, we divided two groups in experiment. One group is responsible for CO2 fixation on outer membrane, and the other group takes charge in N-butanol production, so you may see different edition of our lab notes. However, everyone of us has maked great efforts to show you the best of us! Following the notebook we will show you what we have done and the most important things we have gone through.
Butanol lab notes
Construction of the n-butanol pathway
Members in charge of this part: Fan Chuyao, Hu Weipeng
Introduciton: To build up the n-butanol pathway, we have constructed the parts as follow:
Gal1+Hbd+GFP+ADH1
Gal1+Crt+GFP+ADH1
Gal1+Ccr+GFP+ADH1
Gal1+AdhE2+GFP+ADH1
Gal1+cox6+Erg10+GFP+ADH1
Gal1+cox6+Hbd+GFP+ADH1
Gal1+cox6+Crt+GFP+ADH1
Gal1+cox6+Ccr+GFP+ADH1
Gal1+cox6+AdhE2+GFP+ADH1
Gal1+Erg10+cyc1
Gal1+Hbd+ADH1
Gal1+Crt+cyc1
Gal1+Ccr+ADH1
Gal1+AdhE2+cyc1
Gal1+cox6+Erg10+cyc1
Gal1+cox6+Hbd+ADH1
Gal1+cox6+Crt+cyc1
Gal1+cox6+Ccr+ADH1
Gal1+cox6+AdhE2+cyc1
Promoter:GAL1. Terminater:Cyc1.ADH1
2014.5~2014.6
Contents: learning of molecular construction, PCR techniques, transformation of plasmid, several kinds of RFC and their theory and roles in molecular construction. A try to construct COXVI+GFP+ADH1 on pSB1C3.
5.20~5.31
Contents:Obtain COXVI from yeast genome by PCR
1.Digest Vector and COXVI
2.Assemble COXVI to the pSB1C3 with pSB1C3 on it.
3.Verification
Note:failed for the first time.
7.7~7.24
Note: We have a great touble in plasmid DNA extractiobn which makes a serious effect on our schedule. Finally we find that the cause of the problem is the invalid of ampicillin.
7.25~8.31
Contents: moloecular construction
Note:After we figured out the question we met before, we continued our schedule smoothly. Since our enzyme is assembled in plasmid pUC57,which is provided by Genwiz, and GFP+ADH1 is assembled in plasmid pSB1C3, we digestd GFP+ADH1 from pSB1C3 and assmbled it in pUC57 after the enzyme.We first used pUC57 as our vecto, and then we transported our parts to yeplac181(hbd,crt,erg10) and yeplac352(ccr,adhe2)
However, new obstables will always come unless we stop moving on.
Some parts length is very close to the vector, it’s very hard to verify whether we succeed or not. We overcome this problem by assemble the parts in other vector whose length is much longer.
We have touble in constructing the mitochondrial targeted n-butanol pathway.COXVI has failed to link with enzyme for so many times. We think the cause might be the short length of COXVI(120) and the much larger size of the vector.In the end ,we choose to obtain GAL1+COXVI from the molecule GAL1+COXVI+GFP+ADH1 that as been sequenced rightly by PCR. Then we assemble GAL1-COXVI in our vector and we do it. After that, we continued to assemble the enzymes after GAL1-COXVI.This time the thing become much more easier and we do have a great success.
Sometimes we would encounter some phenonmenon that although we had verified the sequence length by double enzyme digestion,the sequencing results did not match the reference sequence.
We find the sequence of Erg10 has more than one cleavages,which lead to a result that we can’t get the right sequence before gel extraction, so we have to mutate the cleavage so that it can’r be digested by fast digest enzyme.
We find a serious problem that our enzymes have termination codon TAA ,which means our enzymes cannot fuse with the GFP., so we have to knock down TAA by fusion PCR.
9.1~10.1
Contents：Knock down the termination codon by fusion PCR.
Notes: We have two round of PCR to get a whole mutated sequenceAt first, we use PrimerStar( TAKARA) because of running out of KOD FX,  it works in the first round, however, it fails in the second round. We have desperated for a time. The situation become optimistic when we buy new KOD FX and finally, we succeed to complete the mutation job.
Finish molecular construction.
Notes:After constructing the indivial parts,we need to assemble Gal1-erg10-cyc1,Gal1-hbd-ADH1,Gal1-crt-CYC1 in yeplac181, which is leucine auxotroph and Gal1-Ccr-ADH1,Gal1-Adhe2-Cyc1 in yeplac352,which is uracil auxotroph. Here we get stuck again. We have failed for many times but can’t figure out the problem. Futhermore, our competent cells are contaminated, ampicillin also has some problem. Even though we refresh the ampicillin and buy competent cells, we still can’t get the job done.
Construct biobricks.
Notes: Luckily, this part goes on smoothly.
Proceed inducible expression.
Notes:
The procedures of inducible expression.
1.transform plasmid into yeast by electrophoretic transfer
2.incubate at 30℃ for two days.
3.pick up a colony from the plate and transfer to YNB-glucose mixed growth medium, incubate in the shaker for 24 hours
4.Wash off the glucose by PBS and incubate with galactose for 12 hours.
5.Analyze by fluorescence microscopy.
To verify the COXVI, we also use Mito Tracker to stain mitochondria and do an overlap with the  green fluorescence.
Conclusion: No matter what we get at last, we improve ourselves a lot and gain the friendship. We share joy and pain , laughs and tears, we are SCUT-iGEMers.
CO2 fixed simulation lab
May
Week 1
We successfully prepared our TOP10 strain to be competent. We started to do the PCR in order to get our targeted gene such as GFP and leading peptide. And meanwhile, we had to practice our lab skill and improve our abilities.
Week 2
We developed the cooperative contract with the Genewiz that helped us synthesize the scaffold protein GBD, PDZ and SH3 with the ligand behind them. Also, this week we made our plan and time table.
Week 3
We successfully constructed the YFP, BFP, GFP and OFP with the RFC 23.At the same time , we waited for our gene from Genewiz.
Week 4
We got the leading peptide Tom22 by PCR and added it into the plasmid yeplac181. We decided to add it behind the GBD, SH3, PDZ fusion until they was finished synthesis.
June
Because of the final exam was coming. We must bury our heart in preparing the exam. So the experiment was stopped. Besides, we got the synthesis gene GBD, SH3, PDZ from Genewiz.
July
Week 1
We still reviewed our courses and hoped to get the good GPA. The last exam would be held in 7th, July. After that, we would concentrate on the experiment.
Week 2
This week we carried on our experiment. Unfortunately, we were puzzled by the contaminated strains but we could not find out why our strains contaminated. So first of all ,we cleaned our super clean bench but it didn't work. At the same time ,we continued our experiment, but we failed all the experiment and could not get any results. That's so crazy. So we continued checking all the factors which resulted in contamination. We remade our LB plates and check our competence cell. But there're still the contaminated phenomena. We still did some   microscopic examination for our strains. But it was normal. How should we do?
Week 3
We still could not construct anything. We asked our instructor to give us the new strain. But the contaminated phenomena was still here. We talked it with our advisor and they didn't know what on earth it's going on. So this week we also do nothing.
Week 4
This week our antibiotic Amp had been consumed. So we remade them and found out that the contaminated phenomena went to the end.  This week we sped up constructing our device. This week we built the parts including:
PRK
Rubisco
CA
BFP+GBD ligand
YFP+SH3 ligand
GFP+PDZ ligand in Yeplac 181
August
Week 1
Lucky, we did not face any problem so we added the promoter GAL1 in front of the parts mentioned  above. And then, the construction of scaffold protein started.
Week 2
The work we done to construct the device was:
1.PCR or cut it down from plasmid
2.Cut it with four restriction enzymes
3.Link them with ligase.
4.Transform
5.Pick up the E. coli and shake it with LB.
6.Obtain the plasmid and have a check.
So this week we almost constructed all the parts.

Week 4
Oh, this week we got the bad news as if we were struck by lightning. We forgot one thing, if we wanted to construct the fusion protein, we must delete the stop codon TAA. But we forgot this work. So we must design the new primers to do the fusion PCR to mutate the DNA, and added them to the plasmid.
September
Week 1
This week new term started. Because of the stop codon problem, we reconstructed the device. Some of them was finished. But the parts of PRK, CA, RuBiSco met some problems.
Week 2
Some of our parts started to be made the biobricks. Such as the GAL1+BFP+GBD ligand+ADH1, GAL1+GFP+PDZ ligand+ADH1, GAL1+YFP+SH3 ligand+ADH1, and GAL1+BFP+GBD ligand+ADH1+GAL1+GFP+PDZ ligand+ADH1+GAL1+YFP+SH3 ligand+ADH1, but in the scaffold protein respect, we couldn't combine the Tom22 + ADH1 with scaffold protein parts.
Week 3
This week we partly constructed the 1:1:1 scale and other scale scaffold protein plasmid in YEplac181. So there's no doubt that we should transmit it into yeast with the bind ligand added the fluorescent protein so that we could check whether the ligand worked. After the cultivation, we used Confocal Laser Scanning Microscope to get our results.
Week 4
We continued the work last week, and constructed the other scales between GBD,SH3 and PDZ protein. Also, we started to made the growth curve of our wild yeast as well as the one containing the plasmid. We spent all the night and some member got cold.
October
Week 1
We started to prepare our wiki, posters and the presentation. But our experiments still went on .We changed our thoughts about the design of wiki, poster and our uniforms.
Week 2
We sped up composing our wiki, and drew some figures to express our ideas. On the other side, we carried on the construction of the device and planed to checked the carbon capture pathway we built by GC-MS.

iGEM Team attributions page
Each team must clearly attribute work done by the student team members on this page.  The team must distinguish work done by the students from work done by others, including the host labs, advisors, instructors, and individuals not on the team roster.
Why do we have this requirement?
Attribution Template
We have this requirement to help the judges know what you did yourselves and what you had help with. We don't mind if you get help with difficult or complex techniques, just be sure to report the work your team did and the work that was done by others.
For example, you might choose to work with an animal model during your project. Working with animals requires getting a license and applying far in advance to conduct certain experiments in many countries. This is something that is difficult to achieve during the course of a summer, but much easier if you can work with a postdoc or PI who has the right licenses.
A great example of complete attribution comes from the Imperial College London 2011 team (scroll down to the bottom of their team page to see attributions).
Here are some of the fields we recommend you have on this page. If there are other areas not listed below, but applicable to your team/project, please feel free to also list them on your attributions page. Please feel free to remove any areas not applicable to your project.
General Support
Project support and advice
Fundraising help and advice
Lab support
Difficult technique support
Project advisor support
Wiki support
Presentation coaching
Policy & Practices support
Thanks and acknowledgements for all other people involved in helping make a successful iGEM team.

iGEM Team attributions page
Each team must clearly attribute work done by the student team members on this page.  The team must distinguish work done by the students from work done by others, including the host labs, advisors, instructors, and individuals not on the team roster.
Why do we have this requirement?
Attribution Template
We have this requirement to help the judges know what you did yourselves and what you had help with. We don't mind if you get help with difficult or complex techniques, just be sure to report the work your team did and the work that was done by others.
For example, you might choose to work with an animal model during your project. Working with animals requires getting a license and applying far in advance to conduct certain experiments in many countries. This is something that is difficult to achieve during the course of a summer, but much easier if you can work with a postdoc or PI who has the right licenses.
A great example of complete attribution comes from the Imperial College London 2011 team (scroll down to the bottom of their team page to see attributions).
Here are some of the fields we recommend you have on this page. If there are other areas not listed below, but applicable to your team/project, please feel free to also list them on your attributions page. Please feel free to remove any areas not applicable to your project.
General Support
Project support and advice
Fundraising help and advice
Lab support
Difficult technique support
Project advisor support
Wiki support
Presentation coaching
Policy & Practices support
Thanks and acknowledgements for all other people involved in helping make a successful iGEM team.

Meet The Team, Part 1: the Undergrads
Daniel El Primero de la Torre
BSc Biotechnology (1st Year); conceived the Azo Dye Project.
I am currently studying a BSc Biotechnology degree, having just completed my first year. I joined iGEM because I find genetic engineering extremely interesting and with a huge range of potential applications, especially with a synthetic biology approach. It is also a great opportunity for me to gain experience in the different elements that have to be brought forward in order to successfully carry out a project. As I have only just completed my first year, my roles within the team will be to support those who are more experienced in their duties, trying to learn as much as possible on the way. In the future, I would like to take further studies like an MSc or PhD, probably related to synthetic biology or genetic engineering. Outside science, my main interests are music, being able to play several instruments, and nature.
Maurice Bertrand
BEng Biochemical Engineering (2nd Year).
As a 2nd Year Biochemical Engineering student, my degree focuses mainly on bioprocess design and optimization, with an emphasis on high value therapeutic production and purification. I have a strong interest in the technical aspects of iGEM and am excited by Synthetic Biology’s vast breadth of theoretical applications. The areas of Public Engagement and Web Design also appeal to me. Within iGEM, I hope to develop strong interpersonal skills and to gain knowledge on effective team management. As a less experienced team member, I plan to contribute mainly by supporting my well-practiced teammates in their efforts to maximize our chances at succeeding in the competition and providing the best learning experience for everyone.
Georgia Bondy
BSc Natural Sciences (2nd Year).
At the moment I am studying BSc Natural Sciences and have just completed my second year; specialising in organic chemistry and neuroscience. Prior to this degree, I undertook a module in ‘Genetics and Health Issues’ at the Open University. In 2011, I achieved a regional finalist position for the UK in the Google International Science fair, and I currently work in the Neural Computation Lab in the Wolfson Institute for Biomedical Research as an Electron Micrograph analyst. In the future, I am interested in undertaking a PhD in biophysics or SynBio. In addition, I compose music, do some graphic design, and bake delicious things (or so I've been told).
Joy Faucher
MEng Biochemical Engineering with Chemical Engineering (2nd Year).
I am interested in applying and integrating my knowledge of bioprocessing to an epidemiological context and harnessing this opportunity with Synbio to open up an approach to potential future healthcare solutions. Previously, I have worked on reviewing novel biomarker strategies for the diagnosis of tuberculosis with the French Institute for Research and Development. Aside from my studies, I have a growing interest in cognitive science, enjoy playing music and sports, and have been part of creative/entrepreneurial challenges. Most of all, I enjoy making things!
Edoardo Gianni
BSc Biotechnology (1st Year).
As a first year biotechnology student, I wanted to jump into iGEM as soon as I got into university. In my last two years of high school, I grew fascinated by synthetic biology as a powerful tool to work on the inner code of living organisms. I became involved in the DIYbio community, where I found sources of knowledge otherwise inaccessible to me, which sparked my interest even more. I thus like to call myself a biohacker, although I have only been able to kill some bioluminescent algae so far. My role within the team will be the official jester, master of 3D printing, and best Italian scientist. I hope that by taking part in iGEM I will finally be able to do myself what I have been reading and reading about, building on what has been done so far, and learning the key skills to help found new teams in the future. When I am not in the lab you will probably find me on a fencing piste, jumping and smiling, or in the UCL Makespace, jumping and smiling.
Sanjay Joshi
BEng Biochemical Engineering (2nd Year).
I currently study Biochemical Engineering, having just completed my second year. The vast range of potential applications and recent developments in synthetic biology enthrals me. iGEM offers me the opportunity to further my interest and gain experience in the field of synthetic biology, as well as acquire the necessary skills to work in a successful and productive interdisciplinary environment throughout the project. Biochemical Engineering serves as an ideal platform to understand the science and function of our iGEM project, as well as scope its potential industrial applications. My future goals are to complete further education in Bioinformatics or Bioprocessing, along with expanding my expertise in business and economics.
Behzad Karkaria
BSc Biomedical Sciences (2nd Year).
I am currently studying BSc Biomedical Sciences at King's College London; my degree covers a wide range of topics with a focus on gene cloning and cell biology. UCL have been kind enough to offer me a position on their iGEM 2014 team, an experience which I will hopefully use to found a team at my own university. I am excited by the potential of synthetic biology with a specific interest in its application within the medical field, I am intent upon directing my career pathway towards this field. Outside my studies, I play guitar, write as well as watch comedy, and play Ultimate Frisbee.
Ning Lu
MEng Biochemical with Chemical Engineering (2nd year).
After I was first told the finer details of iGEM competition from a former team member, last year, I could not stop thinking about what a great idea it is to have students from multi-disciplinary backgrounds to complete a project that they have decided between themselves. Therefore, here I am in the UCL iGEM 2014 team, ready for any tough challenges. I have recently finished my second year in Biochemical Engineering. With a moderate amount of lab experience and my own fascination, I am looking forward to helping out in the lab, as well as with public engagement. Dancing and doodling has always had a part in my life and I rather enjoy performing on a stage after my first stage experience at 6. Beside all these, I still believe a game of DOTA never hurts!
Lewis Iain Moffat
MEng Biochemical Engineering and Bioprocess Management (1st Year).
I have just completed my first year of a combined Bachelors and Masters programme in Biochemical Engineering and Bioprocess Engineering (MEng). I am absolutely fascinated by synthetic biology and its infinite range of applications; as such, I am really looking forward to being a part of the UCL iGEM 2014 team. In the future, I hope to complete a further Masters or Doctorate in bioinformatics or biomedical engineering and go on to work in the venture capital industry. Aside from my degree, my academic passions also stretch to computer science, literature, and economics. All of which I have had the opportunity to study at a higher level. Combined with my love of sports, video games, science fiction and fantasy, I hope to bring all of my passion and energy to our iGEM team so that we have the best project possible.
Pamela Niem
BSc Biomedical Sciences (2nd Year).
I am currently studying for a Biomedical Sciences BSc and have just completed my second year, specialising in integrative physiology and anatomy. I became interested in synthetic biology due to its huge variety of applications, with my interest particularly focusing on the development of innovative methods for treating disease. In the UCL iGEM 2014 team, I am involved with human practice, public engagement, art/design, and assisting with wet lab. Other than science, I love playing the guitar and piano, singing my feelings, and eating brownies.

MEET THE TEAM
David Yao | Student Advisor | Neuroscience
[Why iGEM?] iGEM creates an opportunity to explore scientific frontiers and cross disciplinary boundaries with a team of passionate undergraduates. It's challenging, inspirational, and I learn something new from the students every day. What's there not to love about the program?
[Favorite Ice Cream?] Mint n' chip -- only the green kind though, if it's not the green mint kind it- it's just not the same.
Kayla White | Sophomore | Psychobiology
[Why iGEM?]Our potential for pushing the boundaries of synthetic biology is limited only by the extent of our creativity-it’s pretty amazing! It is important for our generation to overcome the negative stigma surrounding genetic engineering in our society and embrace this burgeoning field with a perspective anchored in scientific evidence. Working on a team of undergrads enthusiastic about synthetic biology excites me for the next-generation innovations this field has to offer!
[Favorite Joke?] How many tickles does it take to make an octopus laugh?
Ten tickles!
Hayden Speck | Junior | Biology & History
[Why iGEM?] I joined iGEM because I like searching for interdisciplinary solutions to problems.
[Favorite Television Series?] Monty Python's Flying Circus--a hilarious series written by some of the most over-educated comedians ever.
Michael Cheng | Sophomore | Bioengineering
[Why iGEM?] We get to choose our own synthetic biology project? We also get to execute it ourselves? Wait, and the stuff that we’re doing is awesome and is actually useful? Why isn’t everyone doing iGEM?.
[Favorite Drink?] Coffee. I dispute the claim that caffeine is not an essential nutrient.
Xingyi Shi | Sophomore | Statistics
[Why iGEM?] I enjoy being in a group of students from various backgrounds and yet share the same interest as them. iGEM has provided me with valuable opportunities and experiences for something new and unfamiliar to me.
[Favorite Doctor?] 11th Doctor Matt Smith. ""Bow ties are cool.""
Olivia Cheng | Junior | Microbiology, Immunology, and Molecular Genetics (MIMG)
[Why iGEM?] iGEM allows me to explore possibilities and potentials in science while gaining experience in research.
[Favorite Coffee?] Cafe Latte - Not too strong, yet nothing fancy.
Fasih Ahsan | Junior | MIMG & Bioinformatics
[Why iGEM?] I am truly fascinated by our ever-growing ability to harness the power of biology and shape it for our own uses and designs.  Being a part of iGEM opens the door to independently exploring and discovering new paradigms of synthetic biology.  I am thrilled to begin unearthing these hidden secrets with UCLA iGEM!
[Favorite Hot Sauce?] Sriracha mixed with Cholula and a couple drops of Tapatio!
Phillip Nguyen | Junior | Biochemistry
[Why iGEM?] iGEM is interesting to me since there is much room for creativity,diversity, and autonomy. Synthetic biology is a highly interdisciplinary field that allows individuals from a multitude of backgrounds to come together and produce novel systems, or reinvent preexisting ones. Being that it is primarily undergraduate, I have the impression that everyone has a bigger voice in project directions compared to a conventional university lab.
[Favorite Molecule?] Phosphatidyl Choline
Kane Nania | Junior | Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering
[Why iGEM?] The idea that we can engineer life to do practically anything, the idea that that we can abstract this engineering through iGEM and the standardization of genetic parts, is pretty awesome. The potential of synthetic biology is massive and I want to be a part of that.
[Favorite Hairstyle?] Bald with a mullet. Preferably if they have a beard which connects with the mullet. Preferably yet if the beard is of the chinstrap flavour.
Sam Michaels | Freshman | Bioengineering
[Why iGEM?] The environment of students exploring the workings of life is inspiring to witness and exposes me to a new world of possibilities.
[Favorite Aquatic Animal?]Octopus! Their tentacles are fascinating to watch roll around and suction to everything in sight.
Anuved Verma | Junior | Molecular, Cell, and Developmental Biology (MCDB)
[Why iGEM?] I like to make stuff, and iGEM is perfect for that. The opportunity to work on our own projects and build something new is an incredibly unique and rewarding one. Along with providing us with experience across several fields, iGEM is a great way to get to meet many fun, smart, and interesting people!
[Favorite Fast Food Chain?] Subway. Eat fresh.
Ethan Rao | Freshman | Biochemistry
[Why iGEM?] I believe genetic engineering will be one of the fastest growing fields in the next few decades. iGEM is laying the foundation for that.
[Favorite Current TV Show?] Game of Thrones. If you're not watching Game of Thrones, you seriously need to re-evaluate your television priorities. House of Cards is a close second.
Aalhad Patankar | Sophomore | Bioengineering
[Why iGEM?] I joined iGEM because the idea of genetic engineering, and creating such complexity from such a ground level still amazes me.
[Favorite Ninja Turtle?] Raphael.
Daniel Cancilla | Junior | Biochemistry
[Why iGEM?] This program is unique because it offers undergraduates like myself so many different opportunities.  We have the opportunity to learn about new ideas from a wide variety of disciplines.  We get to take these ideas and apply them in creative ways.  Most importantly though, the program offers us the opportunity to meet and hang out with other bright and enthusiastic students!
[Favorite Pastime?] Snowboarding. It's a lot of fun. You should try it!

iGEM Team attributions page
Each team must clearly attribute work done by the student team members on this page.  The team must distinguish work done by the students from work done by others, including the host labs, advisors, instructors, and individuals not on the team roster.
Why do we have this requirement?
Attribution Template
We have this requirement to help the judges know what you did yourselves and what you had help with. We don't mind if you get help with difficult or complex techniques, just be sure to report the work your team did and the work that was done by others.
For example, you might choose to work with an animal model during your project. Working with animals requires getting a license and applying far in advance to conduct certain experiments in many countries. This is something that is difficult to achieve during the course of a summer, but much easier if you can work with a postdoc or PI who has the right licenses.
A great example of complete attribution comes from the Imperial College London 2011 team (scroll down to the bottom of their team page to see attributions).
Here are some of the fields we recommend you have on this page. If there are other areas not listed below, but applicable to your team/project, please feel free to also list them on your attributions page. Please feel free to remove any areas not applicable to your project.
General Support
Project support and advice
Fundraising help and advice
Lab support
Difficult technique support

Team UNIK Copenhagen 2014
Our team consist of 4 people with different nationalities from the field of life science. We are all studying at University of Copenhagen and our home base is at UNIK Center for Synthetic Biology. You can click on the team photo to read more about each person or just scroll down on this page.
Cecilie
My name is Cecilie Cetti Hansen. I am studying for my B.Sc in Biotechnology at University of Copenhagen. I like to work in the lab and have found an interest in plant based synthetic biology and metabolic engineering. It motivates me to be a part of developing ideas and to obtain new knowledge in this field. I am inspired by the Icelandic singer Björk's Biophilia project. It is cool when science is combined with art - especially when it is used to educate people in science.
Henrik
My name is Henrik Munk Frisenvang. I have a bachelors degree in Biology-Biotechnology from  University of Copenhagen. In my bachelor year I primarily focused on plant pathway discovery for the purpose of heterologous production of high-value plant compounds.  I have currently completed the first year of my masters’ degree in Biology-Biotechnology at Copenhagen University. I have spent the first semester of my master’s degree in New Zealand where I did a research project on the Vitis vinifera transposonactivating properties of yeast. I joined iGEM because I think that multidisciplinary team of dedicated students sounds like a fun and interesting group to be part of and can achieve exciting results.
Morten
My name is Morten Hessellund Raadam, about to start on the third year of my B.Sc in Biochemistry. Ready for university but unsure which area in the chemical STEM fields I was interested in; I first got an AP degree in Chemical and Biotechnical Science. It was doing these two and a half years, working as a lab technician with everything from microbiology to analytical chemistry, I discovered my love and enthusiasm for molecular biology. Specifically the concept and engineering approach of synthetic biology appealed to my way of thinking, and to pursue this interest I started on a B.Sc in Biochemistry. The iGEM competition is close to the embodiment of my interest, and I learned about it 4 years ago, but it was not until this year I felt like my knowledge was at a point where I could make a real contribution to a team and benefit fully from the experience.
Owik
My name is Owik Herold-Majumdar and I am a Master student at the University of Copenhagen in the field of Biotechnology. I have Bachelors in Molecular Biotechnology form the Technical University of Munich. I also got in touch there with iGEM but had never the opportunity to participate in the competition. I think iGEM is a great chance to put theory in practice by performing an individual project. Moreover, I like the aspect of creating an own small researcher community within iGEM which creates a great network with valuable contacts. Last but not least, is iGEM a lot of fun especially with a nice team like we are!

ATTRIBUTIONS
Students
Hassan Chaudhry
Hassan is a Mathematician at Warwick and found himself leader of the team and inadvertently our resident travel agent. He also took a firm hand in organising and keeping on top of the team while developing models for many of the parts in the meantime. Unfortunately, developing an allergic reaction to a tree he had come ""very close to touching"" outside the lab, he refused to dine al fresco with the rest of the team on the (rare) hot summer days.
Leo Vong
Leo is a 2nd year student studying Biochemistry at Warwick, hailing from all over the midlands. He was key to sponsorship, obtaining free gloves, laboratory reagents and other samples needed for our work in the laboratory.
Chris Davis
Chris is studying Physics at Warwick and was our honorary computer scientist taking the wiki by storm. He was also a major part in our data analysis and was driven almost insane by biologists and their ""continuous lack of enough repeats and far too many abbreviations"".
Iva Burova
Iva has ventured furthest from home, coming from Bulgaria and is studying Engineering at Warwick, looking to specialise into biomedical engineering post uni. She took a shine to the lab work, deeming everything ""so adorable"", and kept a meticulous lab book where you could find anything and everything experiment related. She was infinitely helpful, coming in at weekends and staying late every evening in order to complete the tasks at hand and studying for her exams alongside.
Dan Goss
After briefly lapsing his strong vegan beliefs and accepting the use of fetal bovine serum and calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase in the lab, he took charge of the measurement study and put his controversial views to good use at the forefront of our human practice ventures. He spurned interesting and heated debates about the project and its applications as well as its environmental impacts.
Chelsey Tye
Chelsey is currently studying in Chemistry following a 3 year undergraduate course in Chemical Biology at Warwick. She helped Dan in the measurement study and human practices area.
Caroline de Cock
Carrie studies biomedical science at Warwick and played a major role in the experimental side of the project. She was particularly crucial to the testing in human cells which she particularly enjoyed and successfully tested the IRESs and the aptazyme following some set backs in transfection. Despite her tendency to fall asleep unannounced, she played a key role in the experimental planning and aquiring of results.
Becky Seeley
Becky studies biomedical sciences at Warwick university and is in her final year. Becky took on a major role in the experimetal work.
Ben Livingstone
Ben was king of the modelling, taking major steps forward in the development of both stochastic and deterministic models, as well as creating a programme to speed up the analysis of plates measured in the tecan, instructions for and details of which can be found in the modelling section of our wiki.
Supervisors/Advisors
Alfonso Jaramillo
Alfonso was our PI. With a PhD in theoretical Physics he moved over to Synthetic Biology, shortly after which he involved himself in iGEM in 2006 and has never looked back. His group is currently engineering a synthetic phage, developing directed evolution technologies and engineering novel RNA devices.
Sian Davies
Sian was our secondary supervisor with a PhD in plant biological clocks. She aided in experimental design and kept us on track, giving us our initial safety briefing and crash course in cloning.

Collaboration
We contacted iGEM teams based in the University of York and Edinburgh University and set up Skype interviews. During these interviews we were involved in discussions over Policy & Practices, paying particular attention to team structure. This was in order to help ourselves better understand the possible roles and responsibilities that different hierarchies would require. Furthermore, we questioned each of them on their approach to modelling their systems.
We also held discussions with the iGEM team from Universidad de los Andes in Columbia. This gave us an insight into how our fellow students from the Americas were proceeding and what obstacles were facing them. We covered topics such as sensitivity analysis, estimating parameters in modelling, and how best to maximise efficiency given various budgets. Further, we discussed ventures that would be mutually beneficial to our teams. Amongst the many suggestions the one that particularly stood out was for them to send their model to us and then we would then run it on a supercomputer on their behalf. In turn they would allow us the opportunity to look over their work and see whether we could glean any ideas which could lead to improvements regarding our project.
Surveys were created and sent out to universities around the world. We in turn completed the surveys of iGEM teams across Europe and both North and South America. Following this we were contacted by the team from MIT, with whom we discussed the possibility of using our system as a delivery mechanism for their creation.
We communicated with teams from Hokkaido University and The University of Manchester  providing assistance with modelling using MATLAB as well as gaining feedback on  a program to analyse data produced by our Tecan.
The iGEM team from The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill contacted us, and we realised they were planning a project similar to the one we had decided on. The potential of this was not lost on us, and we eagerly replied as communication between our teams seemed like a particularly beneficial recourse. The similarity of our projects allowed us to share a lot of information, the focus of which was on the modelling aspect.

Students
Hassan Chaudhry
Hassan is a Mathematician at Warwick and found himself leader of the team and inadvertently our resident travel agent. He also took a firm hand in organising and keeping on top of the team while developing models for many of the parts in the meantime. Unfortunately, developing an allergic reaction to a tree he had come ""very close to touching"" outside the lab, he refused to dine al fresco with the rest of the team on the (rare) hot summer days.
Leo Vong
Leo is a 2nd year student studying Biochemistry at Warwick, hailing from all over the midlands. He was key to sponsorship, obtaining free gloves, laboratory reagents and other samples needed for our work in the laboratory.
Chris Davis
Chris is studying Physics at Warwick and was our honorary computer scientist taking the wiki by storm. He was also a major part in our data analysis and was driven almost insane by biologists and their ""continuous lack of enough repeats and far too many abbreviations"".
Iva Burova
Iva has ventured furthest from home, coming from Bulgaria and is studying Engineering at Warwick, looking to specialise into biomedical engineering post uni. She took a shine to the lab work, deeming everything ""so adorable"", and kept a meticulous lab book where you could find anything and everything experiment related. She was infinitely helpful, coming in at weekends and staying late every evening in order to complete the tasks at hand and studying for her exams alongside.
Dan Goss
After briefly lapsing his strong vegan beliefs and accepting the use of fetal bovine serum and calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase in the lab, he took charge of the measurement study and put his controversial views to good use at the forefront of our human practice ventures. He spurned interesting and heated debates about the project and its applications as well as its environmental impacts.
Chelsey Tye
Chelsey is currently studying in Chemistry following a 3 year undergraduate course in Chemical Biology at Warwick. She helped Dan in the measurement study and human practices area.
Caroline de Cock
Carrie studies biomedical science at Warwick and played a major role in the experimental side of the project. She was particularly crucial to the testing in human cells which she particularly enjoyed and successfully tested the IRESs and the aptazyme following some set backs in transfection. Despite her tendency to fall asleep unannounced, she played a key role in the experimental planning and aquiring of results.
Becky Seeley
Becky studies biomedical sciences at Warwick university and is in her final year. Becky took on a major role in the experimetal work.
Ben Livingstone
Ben was king of the modelling, taking major steps forward in the development of both stochastic and deterministic models, as well as creating a programme to speed up the analysis of plates measured in the tecan, instructions for and details of which can be found in the modelling section of our wiki.

Goals
Since firstly taking part in iGEM in 2007, Peking iGEM has the tradition of communicating with other teams in China. This activity strengthens Peking iGEM Team’s understanding of synthetic biology as well as this competition, deepens the friendship with other teams, widens the views towards the advanced fields of modern biology.
During this summer, Peking iGEM 2014 kept this tradition for the following purposes:
a. Communicating experiments and modeling with other teams.
b. Investigating how synthetic biology as well as iGEM Competition spread in China.
c. Spreading the knowledge of algal bloom and promoting our project.
Team Visits
In late August, Peking iGEM 2014 visited several universities in China and participated in the First Central China iGEMers’ Meet Up (Fig. 1). And some universities went to us with their ideas and questions. During this trip, we visited SJTU, ZJU-China, and USTC. To these teams, we introduced our project “Ranger amongst Enemies”, especially the modeling part.
Figure 1. WANG Chenggong was explaining our project in the Central China iGEM Meet Up
Zhejiang University
On August 19th, we arrived at ZJU-China (Zhejiang University) and discussed the biosafety problem and the possibilities of cooperation (Fig. 2).
Figure 2. Group photo with iGEMers from ZJU-China
Shanghai Jiao Tong University
Next day, our team leaved for SJTU (Shanghai Jiao Tong University) in Shanghai. During this visit, the undergraduates and instructors from Bio-X Center, just like our iGEM Club, introduced their project and iGEM Club. We made the consensus that it is probably better treating biology subject as a whole rather than dividing it into many isolated topics. In return, a member from SJTU also joined our group discussion afterwards (Fig. 3).
Figure 3. LIU Jialing (the first person from right end in the first row), a iGEMer from SJTU (Shanghai Jiao Tong University), joined our group meeting.
University of Science and Technology of China
USTC (University of Science and Technology of China) was the next school we visited (Fig. 4). On August 21st, we arrived at USTC in Hefei, Anhui Province. USTC Software provided us with their experiences of building biology software. And the possibility of establishing Peking Software iGEM Team was also discussed.
Figure 4. LIU Shiyu was discussing with iGEMers in USTC about project design.
The First Central China iGEMers’ Meet Up
Later, we participated in the First Central China iGEMers’ Meet Up in Wuhan with other ten teams. ZHANG Haoqian, a former iGEMer of Peking iGEM, also showed up as a speaker and made a lecture. On this meet up, iGEMers summarized developing procedure of Chinese iGEM teams. More than the presentations of each team’s project, the future of synthetic biology in China was discussed actively.
Mutual Facilitation
Zhejiang University
visit more
ZJU-China was doing experiments on E.coli genome, so they were seeking for an effective plan to prevent the leakage of modified genes. And they helped us test the stability of our suicide genes by transferring them into E.coli genome. In return, we tested cell fluorescence behavior for them.
Beijing Institute of Technology
visit more
We provided BIT (Beijing Institute of Technology) some experiment equipments as assistance for their projects.
Beijing Normal University
visit more
Beijing Normal University firstly joined in iGEM competition, and they made a visit to us in late September. We held a discussion about killing improvements and modeling, catching much attention. Transmembrane protein INP was used as the scaffold of surface display system in two teams’ experiments. We compared displaying efficiency between INP and two of its variants, INPN and INPC. Peking iGEM 2014 helped them standardize a BioBrick BBa_K1405002. As for microbes motility was another shared point in our projects, how to establish a proper model became the same concern. WANG Chenggong introduced Peking’s models detailedly, including the insight, the methods, and analysis results. iGEMers from BNU-China offered us many decent suggestions. Later, they discussed Beijing Normal University’s project and WANG Chenggong gave some suggestions on constructing a dynamic model of E.coli and peanut root system, which can quantitatively simulate the process of engineered organism movement(Fig. 5 & 6).
Figure 5. Binding group and some members from Beijing Normal University iGEM Team.
Figure 6. WANG Chenggong was discussing model with some members from Beijing Normal University iGEM Team.
Ocean University of China
visit more
Peking iGEM and OUC-China had pleasant communication experience in the past years. This time, we both chose holin/endolysin lysis system to construct an inducible suicide switch and we discussed experiment protocols and results for weeks. Besides, Peking iGEM provided these two genes with their primers for OUC-China due to the difference between the genes we used. Also, OUC-China sent their gas vesicle plasmids to us and did a confirming test.
In short, team communication is an indispensable part of human practice. Tens of Meet Ups were held before the Giant Jamboree around the world. By communicating, teams exchange their ideas and discuss problems.
This year, some first-year iGEM teams received Peking’s assistance, including advice on modeling, experiments equipment supply and BioBrick (BBa_K1405002) standardization.
It is the 7th year since Chinese teams joined in iGEM competition for the first time and more and more universities even some high schools have established their iGEM teams. Synthetic biology as a novel tool has been improving our life and many ideas from iGEMers came into application. And it is undeniable that team communication did a lot for this. Chinese iGEM teams have been working together to promoting the development of synthetic biology and iGEM Competition. Education based on research impelled passion from young undergraduates, and some of them would surely become specialists in some areas. Peking iGEM believes that team communication is a key to promote synthetic biology development.

Binding: Zhang Zijian&Meng Liuyi
An important improvement was constructing by these two members. They tested binding efficiency between E.coli and cyanobacteria. Equipped with fluorescence microscope, they calculated binding efficiency of protein-algae and E.coli-algae interaction.
Killing: Yao Lanqiu&Lu Xiaoyu
Killing cyanobacteria is the core of our project, so YAO and LU spent a lot of time searching for a weapon. Finally, lysozyme was chosen from tens of candidates. They measured cyanobacteria growth curves under different conditions. Killing effects on different species of cyanobacteria were tested by them, which showed the wide applicability of our project.
Degradation: Jin Yuji&Zhang Fengyu
Algae toxins are serious threats from algal bloom. Degradation group found a enzyme MlrA that can degrade it. A sophisticated experiment assay was established to test degradation efficiency.  Several signals were tried for the sake of secreting MlrA outside cells.
Suicide: Wu Jie
Considering biosafety, a suicide system was introduced into our E.coli. Wu Jie made effort transferring induction suicide system into E.coli. He tested growth curves of E.coli under variant inducing conditions.
Gas vesicle: Sherry Teng
Sherry came to Peking iGEM during the summer and was taking the gas vesicle experiments. She used strains from OUC-China and did a lot to make them float. More than experiments, Sherry polished Peking‘s wiki drafts.
Protein purification: Mu Xuelang&Zhu Shiyu
To get quantitative data of binding and degradation, we planned to use purified proteins to do experiments. These two members spent the whole summer working with proteins. The purified proteins supported subsequent experiments and provided reliable data.
Model: Wang Chenggong&Ni Congjian
Using mathematic methods modelling biology phenomenon is what we used this year. We established 3 models, binding model, application model, and cellular burden, corresponding binding  experiments，killing experiments, and cell burden estimation respectively. Besides model, Wang as team leader, contributed much confirming our experimetns progress. And he build the framework of our wiki.
Art design: Huang Xiaoyu
Huang Xiaoyu designed logo, icons for each group, and wiki for Peking iGEM 2014. What’s more, ppt template, poster and banner were from her hands. And she beautify our photos.
Team leader: Yu Congyu
As team leader of Peking iGEM 2014, YU and vice team leader organized experiments and set timeline for each group. He finished the human practice part of our project and led a field investigation to Taihu lake to get firsthand material of algal bloom.

Goals
Since firstly taking part in iGEM in 2007, Peking iGEM has the tradition communicating with other teams in China. This activity strengthens Peking iGEM Team’ understanding of synthetic biology as well as this competition, deepens friendship with other teams, widens views towards the advanced fields of model biology.
During this summer, Peking iGEM 2014 kept this tradition for the following purposes:
a. communicating experiments and modelling with other teams.
b. Investigating how synthetic biology as well as iGEM Competition spread in China.
c. Spreading the knowledge of algal bloom and promoting our project.
Trip
In later August, Peking iGEM 2014 visited several universities in China and paricipated in the First Central China iGEMers’ Meet Up.(Figure 1) And some universities went to us with their ideas and questions. During the trip, we visited SJTU, ZJU, and USTC. To these teams, we introduced our project “Ranger amongst Enemies”, especially introduced the modelling part.
Figure 1： WANG Chenggong was explaining our project in the Central China iGEM Meet Up
Zhejiang University
19th, August, we arrived at ZJU (Zhejiang University). On the meeting, biosafety was the main topic. ZJU was doing experiments on E.coli genome, so they were seeking a comprehensive plan preventing leakage of modified gene. While we used an algae toxin Microcystin(MC) in our experiments, biosafety is a serious concern to us. Instrutor of ZJU iGEM was invited to join their discussion. (Figure 2)
Figure 2: Group photo with iGEMers from ZJU
Shanghai Jiao Tong University
Next day, our team leaved for SJTU(Shanghai Jiao Tong University) in Shanghai. During this visit, undergraduates and instructors from Bio-X Center, just like our iGEM Club, introduced their project and iGEM Club. We made the consensus that it is probably better treating biology subject as a whole rather than divided it into many isolated topics. In feedback, a member from SJTU also joined our group discussion afterwards.(Figure 3)
Figure 3: LIU Jialing(right end of the first row), iGEMer from SJTU (Shanghai Jiao Tong University), joined our group meeting.
University of Science and Technology of China
USTC(University of Science and Techology of China) was the next school we visited. (Figure 4) 21st, August, we arrived at USTC in Hefei, Anhui Province. USTC Software provided us with their experiences of building biology softwares. And the possibility of establishing Peking Software iGEM Team was discussed.
Figure 4: LIU Shiyu was discussing project design with iGEMers in USTC (University of Science and Technology of China)
The First Central China iGEMers’ Meet Up
Later, we participated in the First Central China iGEMers’ Meet Up in Wuhan with other ten teams. (Figure 4) Former iGEMer of Peking iGEM ZHANG Haoqian also showed up as a speaker and made a lecture. On this meet up, iGEMers summarized developing procedure of China iGEM teams. More than the presentations of each teams’ project, the future of synthetic biology in China was discussed actively.
Helping Others
What’s more, we provided BIT some experiment equipment in assistance of their projects and gave constructive suggestions on modeling to Beijing Normal University. Beijing Normal University firstly joined in iGEM competition, and they made a visit to us in later Sepetmber. We held a discussion and binding experiments, as an important improvement in our project, caught much attention. (Figure 5、6)
Figure 5: Binding group and some members from Beijing Normal University iGEM Team.
Figure 6: WANG Chenggong was discussing model with some members from Beijing Normal University iGEM.
Cross membrane protein INP was used as the scaffold of surface display system in two teams’ experiments. We compared displaying efficiency between INP and its variants including INPN, INPC. Peking iGEM 2014 helped them standardizing a BioBrick BBa_K1405002. As for microbes motility is another shared point in our projects, how to establish a proper model became the same concern.WANG Chenggong introduced Peking’s models, from the insight to the methods, and analysis results. Binding model was explained in detail. Later, they discussed Beijing Normal University’s project and WANG Chenggong gave some suggestions on constructing  a dynamic model of E.coli and peanut root system, which quantitatively simulates the process of engineered organism moving.
Team communication is an undeletable part of human practice. Tens of Meet Ups were held before the Giant Jamboree around the world. By communicating, teams exchange their ideas and problems.
For instance, Peking iGEM and OUC-China had pleasant communication experience in the past years. This time, we both used holin/endolysin system as an induction suicide system, we discussed experiment protocols and results for weeks. Peking iGEM later provided these two genes with their primers to OUC-China due to the difference between the genes we used. Also, OUC-China sent their gas vesicle plasmids to us and did a confirming test.
Some fresh iGEM teams received Peking’s assistance included advice on modeling, providing experiments equipment, and constructing a standardized BioBrick (BBa_K1405002).
It is 7 years after iGEM Competition was introduced to China. More and more universities even high schools established their iGEM teams. Synthetic biology as a novel tool has been improving our life, many ideas from iGEMers came into application. It is undeniable that team communication did a lot for this. China iGEM teams have been working together to promoting synthetic biology and iGEM Competition. Education based on research impelled passion from young undergraduates, some of them would surely become specialist in some areas. Peking iGEM believes that team communication is a key assay enhancing synthetic biology development.
