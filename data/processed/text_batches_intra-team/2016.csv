Hello, we are Xinhong Chen and Yu Feng, members of team Tongji 2015. One year ago, we brought gold medals to school, which was a treasured memory.
Today, it will be turns of my younger brothers and sisters, we believe that I should be responsible for helping them. In the early days of this team, we help them to build the team, and introduced the concept of genetically engineering. Not until they had set their own project and carried on did we set them free and let them to explore. Right now, we are in MIT for graduation design. It feels fascinating to return to MIT after a year, and we will meet team Tongji 2016 to witness their success!

Project Design
Team Kent along with our advisers decided on our project. After a series of brainstorming sessions, we decided on  a project aimed to synthesise magnetite nanoparticles in E. coli ‘Mag-nano-tite’ was chosen. We felt that this would be a relevant project based on current research, that explores the numerous applications for magnetic nanoparticles including waste or heavy metal removal and drug delivery (Kumari et al 2015) (Berry et al 2003) (Estelrich et al 2015). We saw that some bacteria synthesise magnetosomes which are organelles that contain and synthesis magnetite crystals. Through our research we discovered Mam genes, these are a group of genes which encode proteins that aid in magnetite crystal formation (Schüler 2007). The limited literature on these encoded proteins eventually became a focus in our project.
Modelling
We have introduced a new type of mathematical modelling; this novel Big Data topic modelling approach has been introduced to iGEM for the purpose of human practices. Kritam, a team member, used topic modelling to uncover thematic structure in document collections. This provided a simple way to analyse large volumes of unlabelled text.
Wet Lab
Eight of the ten Team Kent members for iGEM this year are bioscience or chemistry students. Rita, Braulio, Jasmine, Sam, Hanya, Andrew, Rachel and Daniie together underwent a learning experience in the wet-lab. Together they carried out a vast range of experiments which included Gibson Assembly, PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction), Ligation, TEM (Transmission Electron Microscopy) and AFM (Atomic Force Microscopy) imaging.
Protocols, experiments and results can be viewed here .
Integrated Human Practices
Human practices were explored by several members of Team Kent. Kritam, Braulio and Rita visited a secondary school to educate pupils about synthetic biology here, we gained perspective and external opinions  on Mag-nano-tite. This provided a wider picture on the synthesis of our magnetite nano-particles which we had  not previously considered synthesising chemically. Rachel, Braulio, Jasmine and Sam were ambassadors for iGEM  at open days for University ofKent. Here, the team interacted with the public, shared our project ideas as well  educating many on the iGEM competition. Daniie interviewed an expert in the magnetic nanoparticle area, who provided insight into the chemical synthesis of magnetite nanoparticles. Kritam, through topic modelling provided a novel means for quantify human practices in iGEM. More information on Human Practices can be found here .
Writing
Throughout the course of our iGEM project the Kent team have been carrying out research including reading related articles to our project. We have discovered that there is not a lot of background information on our chosen project, as well as lack of information on the proteins we have decided to engineer. We have had weekly meetings where we discuss, share thoughts and ideas, as well as make decisions for the benefit of this group. We have recorded the progress of this project in our notebook which can be found here. (hyperlink to notebook) We have designed posters, prepared presentations and written detailed explanations into our project that the whole team has contributed to. The wiki was organised by our team organiser Rachel, and coded by Aleksandra.
The Team
Kritam Thapa
Kritam’s main contributions was as a member of the Human Practice team. He was involved in the outreach aspect of the project. He gave an oral presentation at an outstanding school where he shared and received ideas from the students. Key information gathered from this event has proven central in some decisions we have made in the development of the project. Kritam developed the modelling for our project, he also wrote code for software to be used for the quantitative analysis for integrated human practice via LDA topic modelling.
Daniie Smith
Daniie’s main contributions to the team were as a wet lab member as well as her work for Human Practices. Her work provided a unique angle to this project which allowed us to investigate into alternate methods to chemically synthesise of magnetite nanoparticles. Daniie spoke to experts in the nanoparticle field which gave us crucial insight into the field, this made her a valuable member of the policy and practice team. As a wet lab team member her main contributions were in PCR and the EM imaging of nanoparticles.
Andrew Seaton
Andrew’s main contributions was as a member of the wet lab team and as a member of ‘The Protein Team’, carrying out the expressions of our proteins as well as the extraction and purification of our proteins. Andrew was involved in the validation of our proteins using SDS PAGE and photospectrometry.

Sam’s main contributions was as a member of the wet lab team. She was a member of ‘The Protein Team’, carrying out the expressions of our proteins as well as the extraction and purification of our proteins. Sam was also involved in the characterisation and validation of our proteins using SDS PAGE and photospectrometry.
Aleksandra Zawlocka
Aleksandra’s main contributions to our project were as the designer of our team identity, and she coded our wiki page. She expertly designed our logos, wrote code and prepared several visual assets for our page. Aleksandra also designed our posters and our team banner.
Jazzy Cornish
Jasmine’s main contributions to the team were as a wet lab member, in BioBrick construction and outreach. She used restriction enzyme cutting, Gibson assembly and ligation techniques to construct several of our BioBricks. Jasmine was part of the outreach team, where she attended speaking engagements at the University of Westminster and Kent, engaging with the public and fellow iGEM competitors. Jasmine also engaged in the improvement of previous project.
Braulio Carrillo
Braulio’s contributions to the team was as a wet lab member, he was involved in human practices and collaboration. Braulio was involved in the in vitro and in vivo protein expression, purification and imaging. Braulio was a key member of the human practices team, attending speaking engagements at Simon Langton Grammar School, University of Kent and the University of Westminster.  Braulio will also present at the iGEM jamboree and was involved in the Team Kent iGEM collaboration with UEA.
Rita Adriani
Rita was a key member of the wet lab team, using ligation, Gibson assembly to form viable BioBricks as Rita also contributed to the improvement of a previous iGEM project. Rita was a member of the human practices team, she attended speaking engagements at Simon Langton Grammar School, University of Kent and the University of Westminster where she also presented.
Hanya Benotmane
Hanya’s main contributions were as the social media secretary for Mag-nano-tite. She was in charge of all social media outlets where she continually interacted with other iGEM teams around the world. As a result, Hanya led the collaboration for our team. She organised the collaboration with UEA, where she analysed samples for their project using AFM. She also worked with UC Davis collaborating on ideas for their website iGEMMatch.org. Hanya was also a wet lab member, involved in the AFM imaging of our samples as well as that of a previous iGEM project, she was also involved in human practices.
Rachel Adeyemi
Rachel’s main contribution to this project was as the organiser/team secretary. Rachel contributed as the safety officer, completing the safety documentation required for our project as well as ensuring the lab environment remained conducive for safe work. Rachel contributed with her writing, she aided in the organisation of our wiki, notebook and documented our weekly meetings and brainstorming sessions. Rachel was also a wet lab member undergoing techniques such as Gibson assembly and protein validation. Rachel was involved in human practices where she attended speaking engagements at the University of Kent.

The team:
he student team of our project consists of 15 undergraduates from School of Bioscience and Bioengineering, School of Mathematics, School of Economy and Commerce, School of Design, School of Software Engineering and School of Materials Science and Engineering of SCUT and a high school student from The Affiliated High School of SCNU. We are in different characteristics and talented in different aspects. We gathered together for a project of Innovation Fund of SCUT and that was how team SCUT-WE established which finally became team SCUT-China-B for iGEM as you can see here.
The project:
In November 2015 we visited the tutor of one of our teammates, Professor Pan Li. During the visit we learnt about a frontier technology: CRISPR (Clustered Regularly Interspersed Short Palindromic Repeats)/ Cas9. It interested us a lot so we decided to study it deeper. A member of our team had a relative who had once suffered from lung cancer which made her want to do something for lung cancer treatment. As her wish we made adenocarcinoma of lung as the theme of our project at last. Under guidance of Associate Professor Ling Fei and Tutor Huang Lizhen we began to refer literature and attend seminars and this was the beginning of our journey of iGEM.

Our Team
In this page we introduce our team members, student leaders, and advisors.
We are the second iGEM team from the Leibniz University Hanover and got together in September 2015.  This year, we are 12 highly motivated undergraduate and graduate students from very different fields of study: Biology, Life Sciences, Plant Biotechnology and even Computer Science.  We all share a common interest in synthetic biology and passion for our project. This competition is the perfect opportunity to expand our horizons and use our theoretic knowledge in the lab. Since we have very different fields of study, we had a basic course about TALE proteins and biotechnology itself. Dr. Reinard provided the computer science students with some tutoring in biology.
But let us introduce ourselves:
Our TEAMMATES and ADVISORS

Pamela Himadewi
Role: Student Member
Favorite Band: Maroon 5
Greatest Accomplishment: Be part of MSU first ever iGEM team!
Dream Job: Pharmaceutical Scientist
Pamela is a junior studying in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology/Biotechnology at Michigan State University. She's so excited to be part of the first MSU iGEM team. She believes that synthetic biology is a field of the future that can enhance our life and environment, in a variety of different fields. Through this iGEM project, it also sparked her interests in developing new approaches to utilize cyanobacteria other than biofuel production, such as food industry, and medical applications. Outside of the lab, Pamela likes playing badminton, baking, listening to music, and hanging out with friends.
Lauren Tamm
Role: Student Member
Favorite Band: Bastille
Greatest Accomplishment: Sneaking into the general admission pit at a Bastille concert and crowd-surfing to their last song of the show, ""Pompeii""
Dream Job: Food Technologist for NASA...or a vagabond (Who needs a job?...Or a home?)
Lauren is currently in her third year of working towards a Bachelors of Science in Food Science with a Leadership in Integrated Learning minor. When she isn't studying, working one of her two jobs, meeting with the e-boards of various clubs, or in the lab with the team, you can find her listening to Bastille (a.k.a. literally the best band ever), watching musicals, or eating. Possibly all three at once, but most likely eating. Too many wants and too many dreams - challenge accepted to reach each and every one. Far too ambitious for her own good, but adventure is out there and she can't wait to see where life takes her.
Darwin Warga Kane
Role: Student Member
Favorite Band:
Greatest Accomplishment:
Dream Job: To own and cook at a Wrap Deli
Advisors
Adam Woodruff
Role: Instructor
Favorite Band: Kings of Convenience
Greatest Accomplishment: Patent WO2012109534. I also co-invented the internet with Al Gore. Global warming was a side project of mine and now Al and I don't talk anymore.
Adam Woodruff is a founder of BDW. As CEO, he is responsible for BDW’s day-to-day operations, as well as guiding product development. He earned a BS in physics at Notre Dame and an MS in chemical engineering from the University of Minnesota. He is passionate about translating basic science from the lab bench to the marketplace, where it can make the most difference in the lives of people and the animals they love and depend on.
Eric Young
Role: Greatest mentor/advisor ever
Favorite Band: Depends on my mood! Some notable ones are Third Eye Blind, Odesza, and Kanye West
Greatest Accomplishment: Mentoring the 2016 iGEM Team ;)
I am just entering my 4th year of graduate school and have been mentored by Dr. Danny Ducat on a really cool Synthetic Biology project over the last couple years! (I may be a little biased.) Since being apart of Danny's laboratory, I have really tried to immerse myself in the literature behind the movement of Synthetic Biology, so upon hearing that MSU was starting an iGEM team, I was super excited! These past few months have been whirlwind of experiments and highs/lows that I wouldn’t trade for the world, as it has been such a great experience working with the students and advisors. Outside of graduate school life and in my spare time, I am avid yoga practitioner, backpacking/camping enthusiast, and music aficionado.
Principal Investigators
Dr. Tim Whitehead
Role: Principal Investigator
Favorite Band: Radiohead
Greatest Accomplishment: World’s largest collection of bobbleheads.
Tim’s group develops general methods to engineer and design biological macromolecules for new and/or enhanced functions. These molecules can be useful as biocatalysts to deconstruct renewable biomass to jet fuel, as diagnostics or therapeutics for recognizing and destroying pandemic viruses, and comprise new metabolic pathways for the environmentally friendly production of medicines.
Dr. Michaela TerAvest
Role: Principal Investigator
Favorite Band: The Tallest Man on Earth
Greatest Accomplishment: Achieving her long-term goal of moving back to Michigan!
Michaela's lab works on understanding electron flows in bacterial metabolism with the ultimate goal of engineering bacteria to produce fuels directly from electricity and carbon dioxide. She's been involved with iGEM teams since 2012 when she advised the Cornell University team on creating a bioelectrochemical arsenic sensor using electricity-generating bacteria.
Dr. Bjoern Harmberger
Role: Principal Investigator
Favorite Band: Living Colour
Greatest Accomplishment: Move continents three times and remain sane.
As Chemist and Synthetic Biologist I am stoked about joining the first iGEM team at MSU, after just starting up my new group here in January. In the lab, we are cracking pathways to complex natural products and plant pharmaceuticals, which allows the biosynthetic production in biotech hosts. We hold a range of patents and have an industrial collaboration for the engineering of microbial production of drugs and precursors using glucose as starting material only.
Dr. Danny Ducat
Role: Principal Investigator
Favorite Band: Vampire Weekend
Greatest Accomplishment: In a reality TV show Triple Crown, I won Survivor, Dancing with the Stars, and Cupcake Wars – all in the same year!
Danny’s Plant Research Laboratory recently designed a strain of cyanobacteria that can export a significant fraction of the carbon it fixes (up to 85%) as sucrose. This approach is promising as a potential alternative to land-based crops for sugar production - this level of productivity could exceed sugar output from sugarcane or corn if it could be scaled. Ongoing projects in the lab aim to contribute broadly in the areas of alternative energy development, understanding mixed microbial communities, and photosynthetic metabolism.

A course in synthetic biology
The department of physics, chemistry and biology (IFM) at Linköping University teach a course in synthetic biology. By having the iGEM project partly as a course, the participating students can apply for financial support in order to manage to work with the project during the summer. Students that only participate in the project are welcome as well.
During the course, the iGEM team had access to the equipment and chemicals that were needed during the project. We were given a quick guide with equipment that we had not used before as well. We also had a run through of safety protocols as well as a walkthrough on a risk analysis system called KLARA.
Even though it is a course, the students have planned and organized the project and laboratory work all by themselves, which is some of the criteria for the course. The course is divided into two examination parts. The first part refers primarily to laboratory work and modeling, the second part relates mainly to the presentation and documentation.
The course and the brainstorming started in March 2016. We started to work on the  project at the same time. The laboratory part started in June 2016 It ended October 19th 2016.

This page is used by the judges to evaluate your team for the Attributions bronze criterion .
Delete this box in order to be evaluated for this medal. See more information at Instructions for Pages for awards .
Each team must clearly attribute work done by the student team members on this page. The team must distinguish work done by the students from work done by others, including the host labs, advisors, instructors, and individuals not on the team roster.
Why is this page needed?
The Attribution requirement helps the judges know what you did yourselves and what you had help with. We don't mind if you get help with difficult or complex techniques, but you must report what work your team did and what work was done by others.
For example, you might choose to work with an animal model during your project. Working with animals requires getting a license and applying far in advance to conduct certain experiments in many countries. This is difficult to achieve during the course of a summer, but much easier if you can work with a postdoc or PI who has the right licenses.
What should this page have?

INTERLAB STUDY
We are all students at UT Austin with a passion for biochemistry and kombucha. Because of these passions, we collectively strove to understand and recreate our favorite carbonated tea. We became the 'Bucha Bunch. Our team has been working tirelessly this year to bring our kombucha project together. We would not have been able to present our research without invaluable guidance from our advisors and principle investigators.

Rohan Bhardwaj
2nd Year Cognitive Science Major, Global Health Technologies Minor
Rohan is a kindhearted teammate who loves synthetic biology almost as much as he loves James Harden! He is a Pre-Med student majoring in Cognitive Science and is minoring in Global Health Technologies. When he is not doing human genetics research at the nearby Baylor College of Medicine, he is playing pickup soccer and basketball or hanging out with his friends. This rising sophomore is involved with the wet lab aspect of Rice-iGem and is helping with the mammalian cell culture and testing of the biosensors; he is also involved with human practices.
Kendall Burks
4th Year Biochemistry and Cell Biology Major
Hailing from the great city of Waxahachie (“THE WAX”), TX, Kendall is a true Texan and a rising senior studying Biochemistry and Cell Biology. As an avid plant biologist and geneticist, her love for plants goes far beyond their abilities to produce oxygen or provide us with lovely salads. Kendall and her lab work to understand the inner-workings of the elusive organelle, the peroxisome. Besides her experience in the Bartel Lab, Kendall is a second-year member of the Rice iGEM team and continues to head the Human Practices portion of the project. Since surviving iGEM and the MCAT last summer, Kendall has continued on her path to greatness by presenting at several conferences and applying to the MD/PhD programs of her dreams. The future Dr. Kendall Burks can also be seen working out in the gym, serving on tennis courts, or undertaking the Herculean task known as “the walk to/from West Lot.”
John Chen
1st Year Computer Science Major
John is a freshman from Duncan College majoring in Computer Science. He contributes as part of the wiki team. When he’s not playing basketball, watching basketball or talking about basketball, you’ll find him reading up about the latest technological or scientific breakthroughs.
Kevin Chen
2nd Year Biochemistry and Cell Biology Major
A wild Kevin appears! Kevin is a sophomore premed majoring in biochemistry and cell biology. He gets wet in the lab for iGEM and serves as the club treasurer. Recently coming out of retirement from playing instruments, Kevin can play a few songs on the piano and used to the play the cello; he plays music for patients at MD Anderson. When Kevin’s not busy, he’s probably attempting to work out with his suitemates, catching up on Russell Westbrook blowing up the NBA, or asserting his foosball dominance. Bonus fun fact: he will eat almost everything with chopsticks because he can.
John Luke
3rd Year Physics Major, Minor in Biochemistry
This guy's majoring in Biochemistry and Cell Biology, but his singing voice will make you wonder if he's a Vocal Performance major (totally check out The Rice Philharmonics on Youtube!). Even though a lot of his time this summer was spent cooking up gold nanorods for the Hafner Lab back at Rice, the behind-the-scenes work he's doing for the Rice iGEM team will get them to come to the next Jamboree bigger and louder (and maybe punnier)!
Sofia Gereta
Sofia is just a little hatchling of a Rice owl, but the members page couldn't have happened without her!
Jessica Lee
2nd Year Biochemistry and Cell Biology Major
The extraordinary graphic designer Jessica Lee has involved herself so much in the design of all graphics, for the Wiki and otherwise, that, although she asked all of us to send in short bios for the members’ page, she has been unable to write in her own! Without her initiative to pull together all the subgroups, this Wiki would be very barren.
Quentin Li
3rd Year Bioengineering Major
Quentin is a rising junior from McMurtry College majoring in Bioengineering. In the iGEM team, he will be primarily contributing to the mathematical modeling and wiki. Passionate about advancements in biotechnologies, he also devotes himself to the research at Qutub System Biology Lab. Besides biology, he loves reading, running, biking, and hanging out with friends. When he is not at lab or library, you will probably see him on the outer loop or on the bike track. As a runner, running in a full marathon before graduating from Rice is always one of his dreams!
Margaret Lie
4th Year Biochemistry and Cell Biology Major
The next time you're at the casinos in Lake Charles, Louisiana, there's no one more dependable you could bet on than Margaret Lie. Her organizational skills have yet to be matched by any human, and she always gets the job done. A Biochemistry and Cell Biology major, Margaret is poised to take her senior year at Rice by storm. As if a bachelor's degree weren't enough, Margaret is pursuing her master's degree AT THE SAME TIME. She's just that much cooler than you. Her independent research project focuses on the artisanal craft of creating near infrared fluorescent reporters. As she begins her second year in iGEM, she will continue her role leading the wet lab team on this year's project. In addition to her research and her work for iGEM, Margaret is currently working on approximately 356,234 applications to medical schools. She is appreciative of the opportunity to hone her essay writing skills to the extreme. When Margaret isn't working, you can find her scouring YouTube for the funniest of videos.
Jade Dever Matthews
2nd Year Computer Science
Jade is a sophomore pursuing a computer science degree. He enjoys watching hours of Youtube videos on random tutorials; he is a dabbler in various activities - photography, Super Smash Bros, etc. This is his first year on the Rice iGEM team - writing the code for this very same page!
Emma McCormick
2nd Year Biochemistry and Cell Biology Major
Emma is a rising sophomore studying biochemistry and cell biology. She definitely becomes invested in her research; for a time she enjoyed referring to herself as the Lord of the Drosophila in what she considered a charmingly dorky literary reference. A relic from this period, a framed picture of drosophila larvae a.k.a. maggots, is prominently displayed in her dorm room where it creeps out visitors (and possibly her roommate). Don't tell the flies, but she's moved on to spending long days in the lab with sarcomas. When she's not being science-y, you can probably find her hanging out in a residential college kitchen eating way too many cookies with her friends.
Peter Suzuki
2nd Year Bioengineering Major
Peter Suzuki is a sophomore Bioengineering student from Martel College. This is his first year with Rice iGEM after having participated in iGEM in high school, and he will be contributing primarily to wet lab research for the project. When he's not in the lab culturing bacteria and running PCRs, Peter enjoys playing guitar and violin for Rice Mariachi Luna Llena (which everyone in the Houston area should go see!!) and playing baseball with the Rice club team. Any remaining time that he does not spend sleeping he can be found at the OEDK--and I mean any time of day or night. Literally. He's logged every hour from 12 am to 11 pm at some point this past year. ""Engineering is fun,"" he says. ""Alright sure whatever,"" we reply.
Christine Tang
2nd Year Kinesiology Major
Christine is a rising sophomore at Lovett College who majors in Kinesiology/Pre-med. As someone who is both passionate and careful about research, she is the epitome of a team worker in any setting. Christine is always willing to help out and constantly striving to do her best in anything she does. She's the girl that brightens up the lab every day with a smile or two, even in the morning. If you don't see Christine crunching out results for the whole day in wet-lab, then you will probably catch her drinking coffee, working out or trying to study in the chaos of the lab. Or, if you're lucky, you might see her enjoying a game of Smash...
Peter Tang
3rd Year Bioengineering Major
Work hard, work out, homework; if you catch Peter Tang, you’ll probably find him working. As a junior bioengineer, he definitely has plenty to catch up on. On top of that, he’s got his hands full working at the Maitra Lab in MD Anderson. But, he definitely likes to play hard too and he documents his adventures on the iGem snapchat. As an international man of mystery, Peter has developed a very particular set of skills. He is Gordon Ramsey in the kitchen, Lebron James on the basketball court, and Adele on the karaoke machine. To accomplish all these activities, Peter consumes lots of coffee.
Shaurey Vetsa
1st Year Bioengineering Major
My name is Shaurey Vetsa and I will be a freshman studying bioengineering. I am part of the IGEM Wiki Editors and Software Teams. In my free time, I love playing basketball, drawing, hiking, and reading. A fun fact of mine is that my nickname from middle school has been the grand antelope."

Everything in our life has to do with science. Since my early education I have been fascinated by biological sciences and technology. And I used to believe that “Everything in our life has to do with science”; and that makes life more interesting. However, I was more into human biology than any other branch; that’s why I chose medicine as my favorite and future career to understand and deal with the health of the most complicated biological system on earth. Yet, I truly believe that no one can separate the lab from the hospital because what is discovered in the lab is the cornerstone for the progress made in medicine. I hope one day I will be able to participate in the development of both sciences.

★  ALERT!
This page is used by the judges to evaluate your team for the Attributions bronze criterion .
Each team must clearly attribute work done by the student team members on this page. The team must distinguish work done by the students from work done by others, including the host labs, advisors, instructors, and individuals not on the team roster.
Why is this page needed?
The Attribution requirement helps the judges know what you did yourselves and what you had help with. We don't mind if you get help with difficult or complex techniques, but you must report what work your team did and what work was done by others.
For example, you might choose to work with an animal model during your project. Working with animals requires getting a license and applying far in advance to conduct certain experiments in many countries. This is difficult to achieve during the course of a summer, but much easier if you can work with a postdoc or PI who has the right licenses.

I LOVE challenges and iGEM gives me the chance to experience the thrills of trying different ideas in the field of synthetic biology by means of molecular biology and microbiology. The most exciting thing to me , is when results are not what we thought to be, and the team brainstorms to come up with possible explanations and new experimental designs. Being in iGEM team is my first time to complete a project from scratch and it feels awesome. This is the third year my school takes part in iGEM and not long ago our team had our own lab. We have every reason to believe that with experience accumulated, our iGEM team will be better with our joint efforts.
Zhuoer Dong
Liangti Dai
This summer I mainly work on the conduction of the Measurement tract and the construction of standard parts.
Working on iGEM has allowed me to think of life science through a complete different way'to design a life purposely, to test the possibilities. The construction of standardizing parts is filled with weird and constant error results that had nearly driven me crazy, but they are the key moments for creativity and analysis. It's cool to cooperate with diverse people and have brain storms from time to time. It's a wonderful experience of my life.

I LOVE challenges and iGEM gives me the chance to experience the thrills of trying different ideas in the field of synthetic biology by means of molecular biology and microbiology. The most exciting thing to me , is when results are not what we thought to be, and the team brainstorms to come up with possible explanations and new experimental designs. Being in iGEM team is my first time to complete a project from scratch and it feels awesome. This is the third year my school takes part in iGEM and not long ago our team had our own lab. We have every reason to believe that with experience accumulated, our iGEM team will be better with our joint efforts.
Zhuoer Dong
Liangti Dai
This summer I mainly worked on the conduction of Measurement tract and the construction of standard parts.
Being an iGEMer has opened to me a brand new world of life science‒to design a life purposely, to test the possibilities. The process of parts construction was just like treasure hunting‒searching for possible solutions out of weird errors and abnormal results. A long-awaited positive result was one of the sweetest moments. It's fascinating to work with a group of people and brainstorm from time to time. I've experienced a wonderful summer.

This page is used by the judges to evaluate your team for the Attributions bronze criterion .
Delete this box in order to be evaluated for this medal. See more information at Instructions for Pages for awards .
Each team must clearly attribute work done by the student team members on this page. The team must distinguish work done by the students from work done by others, including the host labs, advisors, instructors, and individuals not on the team roster.
Why is this page needed?
The Attribution requirement helps the judges know what you did yourselves and what you had help with. We don't mind if you get help with difficult or complex techniques, but you must report what work your team did and what work was done by others.
For example, you might choose to work with an animal model during your project. Working with animals requires getting a license and applying far in advance to conduct certain experiments in many countries. This is difficult to achieve during the course of a summer, but much easier if you can work with a postdoc or PI who has the right licenses.
What should this page have?
General Support
Project support and advice
Fundraising help and advice
Lab support
Difficult technique support
Project advisor support
Wiki support
Presentation coaching
Human Practices support
Thanks and acknowledgements for all other people involved in helping make a successful iGEM team
Can we base our project on a previous one?
Yes! You can have a project based on a previous team, or based on someone else's idea, as long as you state this fact very clearly and give credit for the original project.

Work of the Supervisors
Prof. Dr. Rolf Daniel
The whole project is based on Rolf Daniel's idea to overcome the barrier of cell lysis for the expensive Vitamin B12 production. When he still was an associate professor in our department, he was a supervisor for a PhD thesis dealing with the same subject matter (see below). Being the scientific visionary of the project, he schematically planned the necessary experimental roadmap to achieve our goals. Furthermore, he has always been there for the students and other supervisors for general advise.
Furthermore, he was a great help for our fundraising. Also knowing the bureaucracy of our university very well, he encouraged several instances of the university to support our project financially.
Genis Andrés Castillo Villamizar
Genis Castillo has always been the first contact for us students, if we needed help. If technical help for devices or specific protocols we never used before, or instructions and recommendations for the next experimental steps - he was always there for us.
Furthermore, he listened to all test runs of all presentations we gave as the iGEM Team, and gave advise for improvements.
Dr. Anja Poehlein
Being an expert for genomics, Anja Poehlein provided us with the different bacterial strains we needed for our project. Furthermore, she also listened to all test runs of all presentations we gave as the iGEM Team, and gave advise for improvements.
Dr. Andrea Thürmer
Andrea Thürmer kindly offered her support with being in charge for our project, if our other supervisors were prevented.
Work of the Students
We can say  proudly that all laboratory work was indeed done by ourselves. Although in most cases checked by and discussed with our supervisors, we planned most of our experiments on our own, including procuring all necessary protocols.
Our Wiki was prepared only by ourselves. Being inspired by the Design of the iGEM Team Göttingen 2014 (made by Miguel Loera) initially, we developed our own style. Being unexperienced in website design in the beginning, we worked completely self-toughed and learning by doing.
Furthermore, all artwork (as for instance postcard design, stop-motion-video, social media images, style of wiki and website), including picture and video editing was done by ourselves.
Although reviewed by our supervisors, our presentations were all conceived and designed by ourselves. Also our human practice, engagement and social media campaigns were all conceived, designed and conducted by us.
Outside the Team Rooster
Dr. Caroline Toeche-Mittler
Under supervision of Rolf Daniel, she worked on her PhD thesis ""Construction of a bacterial System for the Export of Coenzyme B
"" (translated title). With her work, she laid the foundation for our project.
Avril von Hoyningen-Huene
Being a member for the iGEM Team Göttingen 2015, she prepared all sketches for a stop-motion movie, which strongly inspired our stop-motion movie.
Dr. Kristin Kaiser
Also Kristin Kaiser, member of our department and very passionated photographer, was shooting some awesome group pictures for our team.
Dr. Robert Hertel
Although not being a part of the team roster, Robert Hertel always offered an open ear and sometimes gave us suggestions how to continue our work, if did not work as planned. Furthermore, he provided us with a self made vector we used for some of our test experiments.
Katrina Funkner
Katrina Funkner kindly provided us with some of her electrocompetent strains for testing purpose in the beginning of our labwork, which was a good help for us.
Dr. Jennifer Gerke
We kindly want to thank Jennifer Gerke for supervising our fluorescence microscopy experiments in our institute.
Ute Ludwig
Ute Ludwig provided us with all laboratory equipment we needed for our work. We want to thank her sincerely for her patience and constant help if we were in need of something.
Prof. Dr. Jörg Stülke
Being very successful with the iGEM Teams from Göttingen in 2012 and 2013, Jörg Stülke was the initiator of the founding of the iGEM Team 2016. He invited us into his department in December 2015, where the last iGEM Team resumed their project. This was also our initial brainstorming of our project for iGEM 2016.

Here, you can see him in front of our Institue of Microbiology and Genetics , and the Gänseliesel, the symbol of Göttingen. Since every PhD student from our university has to kiss her after getting his degree, she is probably the most kissed girl in the world.
B12 - The Red Gold
Big and red,
Already startin’ to sweat?
Starter of riot,
Maybe you should try it.
It is essential,
Creator of a radical,
International,
But no need for a medical.
So the round starts,
At its heart
There is a cobalt ion,
Lying in state
If an enzyme attacks,
It fetches,
One of its electrons,
To go on
And there it starts,
Involved in tissue,
Blood and DNA parts,
An obvious import issue.
But don’t be shy,
It’s on your side,
That’s the reason
It will not commit treason.
Committing on B12 are
GlmS, MutB and BtuF,
But think not too far
For what they are
Natural occurring binding domains,
For the red gold,
Which remains,
Outside of the cells
As foretold.
With this small verse,
We come to an end,
Enough time spent,
THE END!

Meet the Team
Alex has been studying chemistry since 2012. He wrote his bachelor's thesis on the mechanism of aminoferrocene-based prodrugs and their synthesis. Currently, he is in the third semester of his master's degree. In his first participation in iGEM he is responsible for the chemical part of the project. He is also in charge of some organization tasks.
Why iGEM (three words)? Boston Boston Boston.
Ariane is studying Integrated Life Sciences in the fifth semester for her bachelor's degree. Now she is focused on the biochemical and bioinformatical path. She is part of the molecular biology section of the team, doing lab work as well as other things.
Why iGEM (three words)? Learning by doing.
Aylin has studied Chemistry and Biochemistry and is currently working on several projects and studying Medicine in Erlangen. She is part of the Human Practices team and also - together with her brother - responsible for the design of the Wiki.
Why iGEM (three words)? Just for fun.
Eva Maria has been studying Integrated Life Sciences since 2014. She is currently in her fifth semester of the bachelor's program. In her first participation in IGEM she is a member of the molecular biology team.
Why iGEM (three words)? To gain experience.
Filip is currently finishing his master’s program in Cell and Molecular Biology. As a remainder from the previous year’s iGEM team, he joined this year to
gain new minions to order around
share his experience with the new guys. He is responsible for coordinating the bio-themed part of the project and the biological lab work.
Why iGEM (three words)? For fun, duh.
Frederike has been studying in the master’s program Cell and Molecular Biology since 2014, which she has finished only a few weeks ago. She is participating in iGEM for the second time. Her role in this year's iGEM team is mainly helping with the lab work.
Why iGEM (three words)? Gain new experiences.
Hannah is currently in her bachelor's program studying Molecular Science. Her role in the iGEM team is working in the laboratory on cloning, building dye-sensitized solar cells and drawing the pictures for the video clip.
Why iGEM (three words)? Create something special!
Hedda is studying primary education after having spent some time in biochemistry and abroad. She is part of the Human Practices team and introduced iGEM to her old school.
Why iGEM (three words)? Teaching kids science.
Laura is currently in the third year of her bachelor’s program of Molecular Science. She is now focusing on the path of Live Science.
Her iGEM adventure began with that one e-mail. It was a crystal-clear attempt to simply recruit some people for some project. To willingly spend her spare time sounded compelling.  As a total newbie when it comes to bacteria, her role in the iGEM team is to be Filip’s apprentice (let’s say slave) in the lab. From cloning DNA to measuring the efficiency of the fabricated solar cells, she is part of most processes of the practical work.
Why iGEM (three words)? That one e-mail.
Max studied Molecular Science and received his master's degree in 2015. He is currently working on his Ph.D. at the Interdisciplinary Center of Molecular Materials.  His role in the iGEM team ranges from guiding and instructing the experimenters to the organization of the whole team.
Why iGEM (three words)? Do something different.
Ramona has been studying Integrated Life Sciences for her bachelor’s degree since 2013. Her role in the iGEM team is working in the lab and helping out wherever she can.
Why iGEM (three words)? Change the future.
Nadine studies Cell and Molecular Biology. She is currently finishing her master's thesis at the Institute of Human Genetics. She also participated at the iGEM competition 2015 with the iGEM Team Erlangen-Nuremberg.
Why iGEM (three words)? Learn something new.
Sabrina is finishing her master's program in Cell and Molecular Biology.  Together with Filip, Sabrina is co-founder of the iGEM Team Erlangen-Nuremberg, which had its debut at the iGEM competition 2015. She wanted to start this team to get insight into synthetic biology at the University of Erlangen-Nuremberg. At the beginning of this year’s project she was working on biofilms growing on FTO glasses. When the cloning started, she was forced to leave the lab for an internship in Berlin.
Why iGEM (three words)? Start something new.
Vladyslav, who was also part of the team last year, recently finished studying Cell and Molecular Biology and submitted his master's thesis this September. His tasks included labwork and proofreading his teammates' writing.
Why iGEM (three words)? Because peer pressure.
Wiebke has been studying chemistry since 2012. She wrote her bachelor thesis on photocatalytically active organic nanoparticles and is currently in the second year of her master’s degree. Next to chemistry lab work she is also in charge of some organization topics.
Why iGEM (three words)? Max asked me.
We want to say Thank You
We would like to express our deepest gratitude to:
Prof. Andreas Burkovski and Prof. Dirk Guldi, for supervising us;
Deniz Caliskan, for designing our Wiki page;
and Martina Lang, for providing the fluorescent protein mCherry.

Each team must clearly attribute work done by the student team members on this page. The team must distinguish work done by the students from work done by others, including the host labs, advisors, instructors, and individuals not on the team roster.
Why is this page needed?
The Attribution requirement helps the judges know what you did yourselves and what you had help with. We don't mind if you get help with difficult or complex techniques, but you must report what work your team did and what work was done by others.
For example, you might choose to work with an animal model during your project. Working with animals requires getting a license and applying far in advance to conduct certain experiments in many countries. This is difficult to achieve during the course of a summer, but much easier if you can work with a postdoc or PI who has the right licenses.
What should this page have?
General Support
Project support and advice
Fundraising help and advice
Lab support
Difficult technique support
Project advisor support
Wiki support
Presentation coaching
Human Practices support
Thanks and acknowledgements for all other people involved in helping make a successful iGEM team
Can we base our project on a previous one?
Yes! You can have a project based on a previous team, or based on someone else's idea, as long as you state this fact very clearly and give credit for the original project.
Inspiration
Take a look at what other teams have done:
2011 Imperial College London (scroll to the bottom)
2014 Exeter
2014 Melbourne
2014 Valencia Biocampus
Team training and Project start
Tell us if your institution teaches an iGEM or synthetic biology class and when you started your project:
Does your institution teach an iGEM or synthetic biology course?
When did you start this course?
Are the syllabus and course materials freely available online?
When did you start your brainstorming?
When did you start in the lab?
When did you start working on  your project?"

Julia Wisnia
I am a rising junior at Canyon Crest Academy.  My passion for biological sciences lead me to iGEM; I was excited to engage in the topics my advisors study.  This year I was introduced to computational methods for performing experiments that I had recently thought to be strictly wet lab.  Our mentors taught us to use programs such as VMD (Visual Molecular Dynamics) to model glucose and its sensor in a variety of environments.  I hope to continue on to the biomedical engineering field using both classical and computational approaches.  I would like to continue to pursue the construction of new biosensors in my future work.

Daria Niewiadomska
Area of expertise: biotechnology, molecular biology
About me: I have started working in a lab during my bachelor and then I thought that this is what I want to do in my life. I have started working in iGEM project by chance, last year, then our group won silver medal. This year we decided to continue and develop our project to get gold medal. What I love in synthetic biology is that, it is easy to see changes that we’re introducing into the system.
Attributions: I was involved in the multipromoter expression system project. I was in charge of assembling constructs and measuring the promoters’ strength (fluorescence measurements). I also contributed to Wiki content: methods, ethical issues and patenting. I described some biobricks, created a part of presentation and conducted classes during workshops. What is more I also prepared survey for human practices.
Julia Zielińska
Area of expertise: biotechnology, molecular biology
About me: When I first started working on iGEM project, it was mostly about gaining practical experience in the lab and learning to work by myself. Now it is so much more- this is my second iGEM edition and I developed as a person who aspires to be a scientist. I‘ve not only learnt lab etiquette, new techniques and widen my scientific horizons, but also figured a lot about myself.
Attributions: assembly of constructs with E1 enhancer & altered UTRs, promoters’ activity measurements, data analysis, preparation of poster, notebook, galleries and  illustrations for wiki, project and results description, project presentation, team’s logo and banner design, sfGFP and mRFP production and purification, biobricks description.
Maja Szymańska
Area of expertise: biotechnology, molecular biology
About me: Participating in iGEM project is a great opportunity to create something own what can be useful for the others. If the system works and we obtain what we expected it's unbelievable fantastic feeling. However, sometimes the results are surprisingly different and we have to face up to new challenges, what is equally exciting. I'm convinced that participating in iGEM will allow me to realize my dreams.
Attributions: I was involved in “open reading frame project”. To check the importance of codon optimization in protein production I designed different variants of fluorescent proteins and measured the fluorescence during 6h culture in three different media. I was also responsible for creating and organizing workshops for students. Thanks to those workshops we have spread synthetic biology among over 230 high school students!
Adrian Lejman
Area of expertise: biotechnology, molecular biology
About me: For me iGEM competition is a great chance to learn something new and meet fantastic people with passion. It gave me a great opportunity to develop and improve my skills. Synthetic biology is an excellent way to create something new which will be useful for other scientists. Achieving pre-peeled goals gives me a lot of satisfaction.
Attributions: My main tasks in our UAM_Poznan team were optimization of open reading frame project and creation of our wiki. I created different versions of two fluorescent proteins and after obtaining them, I was involved in 6 hours measurements to check how they are expressed in E. coli. Second most important challenge was to create our wiki – hope you enjoy it ;)
Marcin Osuch
Area of expertise: biotechnology, molecular biology
About me: It’s quite obvious why I participate in iGEM contest. I will fly over the ocean, I will see skyscrapers, MIT, the Big science, people that have lots of knowledge and plenty of ideas on how to repair this world. And I don’t like having too much of free time. I like the fact that I make something that lots of people don’t even understand, so I have the opportunity to explain it to them and exercise my teaching skills.
Attributions: I help everyone who needs help.
Max Olbrich
Area of expertise: biotechnology, molecular biology, microbiology, virology
About me: Since the beginning of my studies, I have been long waiting for an opportunity to work in the lab more or less on my own rather than just following supervisor’s instruction. iGEM project has given me not only a possibility of that but also provided me with a substantial deal of experience and knowledge that will for sure prove very valuable in the future. As in every job, there are some ups (when everything goes just as planned) and downs (when it just keeps getting worse) but at the end of the day I just can’t imagine myself doing anything else. Although synthetic biology wasn’t my primarily field of interest, it certainly got so during this worthwhile experience!
Attributions: As the newest member of the UAM_Poznań team and therefore the least experienced one, I was mostly involved in helping others with their tasks and experiments. Those included participating in comparison of activity of different modified promoters as well as examination of the influence of ORF optimization on fluorescent protein expression. Together with Marcin, I was responsible for validation of chosen existing BioBrick Parts in order to confirm if they really work as described. I have also been engaged in conducting successful trials of overexpression of different proteins (RNase I, miraculin) using our expression systems. As for our iGEM wiki page, my job was to create and describe the Medal Criteria section.
ADVISORS
Melania Nowicka
Area of expertise: bioinformatics
About me: As a member of another Poznan team I participated in iGEM competition twice in both wet and software tracks. Since that time synthetic biology have become “the core” of my scientific interests. I am really passionate about the “dry side” of synthetic biology, especially design of SynBio tools with medical applications. Now, I am looking for opportunities to combine my broad bioinformatic background and SynBio passion as a PhD student. Because I started my iGEM journey as a member of the first wet lab team in our city it is a real pleasure for me to help the next generation of Poznan iGEMers as the advisor.
Attributions: I was responsible for ORF design, especially for protein expression optimization which includes: different codon and codon pair frequency rankings preparation, codon context optimization (using the software which is the result of my Master's Thesis) taking A-homopolymers and restriction enzymes sites removal. The designed ORFs have also been checked for undesired mRNA secondary structure. As an advisor I helped describing the dry lab part of the project and with the wiki building.
Jakub Bartoszewicz
Area of expertise: bioinformatics
About me: Doing synthetic biology has been my dream from the beginning of my studies. I love designing things. This brought me to participating in two of the previous iGEM editions and pursuing my PhD in bioinformatics for synthetic biology. However, building a community is almost as important as doing science itself, and that’s why I wanted to advise the new generation of iGEMers in their latest project.
Attributions: I helped building the Wiki and crossing the language barrier by proofreading, suggesting refinements and commenting on the Wiki’s content so that nothing (hopefully) would get lost in translation. I have also teamed up with Melania to ensure optimal mRNA secondary structures of some of the designed ORFs.
INSTRUCTOR
Przemysław Nuc
For me iGEM competition is a training in convincing very good students to work as a team, when competitiveness to some extent has to be sacrificed for the cooperation, what in fact is obviously profitable for everyone in a team. Synthetic biology is the most logical way towards understanding  of self-replicating, mistake-making  and self-learning  systems as human beings and bacteria, or in other words: how the evolution does really work. When we collect biological data starting from simple observations of physiologists, molecular biologists’ exaggerated enthusiasm  about a single gene and/or a single protein,  through a global, more and more detailed view of changes in the universe of the cell where let say 30K gene products interact with each other, named ……omics, to the intelligent information selection, processing  and synthesis, finally we obtain the opportunity to formulate an intriguing hypothesis and hopefully a good way to test it."

Students
David Bauwens
David is a PhD student in metabolic engineering and synthetic biology using an array of hosts. When not busy working, David is also a musician, playing guitar, harmonica and doing vocals for his band “Big time Bossmen”. Furthermore he’s an outdoors guy, enjoying nature whilst rock-climbing, open sea kayak, hiking...
Maarten Van Brempt
Maarten is a PhD student, surrounded by synthetic biology every day. This awesome iGEM project offers an exciting opportunity to apply this field in a broader context to handle a global problem. When Maarten is not trying to make this world a better place using synthetic biology, he’s doing it by stopping a zombie apocalypse with nothing but a PS4 controller! While at home, being lazy is the way to enjoy the evening, but when traveling he’s always looking for another kick.
Bob Van Hove
Bob has been a PhD student for long enough for phdcomics.com to become ‘too real’. He’s no stranger to challenging molecular cloning strategies and enjoys messing around with electronics for fun. Outside the lab you’ll often find him in the midst of a thrilling D&D campaign.
Bram De Jaegher
Bram loves mathematical modeling, out of the box projects and computational fluid dynamics. He possesses no knowledge whatsoever about biotechnology, which is a great addition to the team. Bram is convinced that his windsurfing skills will be of great use during the iGEM jamboree. In his free time, Bram is trying to get a PhD scholarschip. Donations will be welcomed with open arms!
Sofie Lodens
Sofie can be described as a woman with a quite unusual hobby: women's rugby. She's playing this in competition for already 6 years, but nevertheless, she doesn't describe herself as an aggressive person ;-). Furthermore, she loves to spend the rest of her free time with her lovely border collie Ziva (picture). Next to this, her PhD is her passion and synthetic biology has always intrigued her, that's why the step into iGEM was not so illogical.
Michiel Stock
Michiel is a machine learning and computational biology PhD student. His research revolves around predicting interactions between molecules and species. Someday he hopes to use this to save the world or brew beer. Not being allowed in the lab, Michiel helps with designing, modeling and characterizing the water collector.
Griet De Clercq
Having difficulties to choose between her two passions, computer science and biology, Griet started her university journey in computer science. She however missed biology too much, and decided to switch over to bioscience engineering instead. Still yearning to work on both fields simultaneously, she joined the bioinformatics master program a few years later. iGEM offers a great opportunity to further explore these fields and learn new things about them, as she is in the biofunction and shape group. In her free time, she likes to swim, sew, or play computer games, depending on the weather.
Bram Danneels
Bram couldn't get enough of the student life, so after his master in biology, he started his current master in bioinformatics. The unique project, the new people to meet, and the new things to learn convinced him to join the iGEM team. That, and the trip to Boston of course. When he's not working on the iGEM PR or the biofunction part, Bram enjoys playing the piano, travelling, or just playing some games.
Wouter Steyaert
Wouter is a very decent guy. He works at the Center for Medical Genetics Ghent - where he mainly analyses exomes, genomes and transcriptomes of patients with a connective tissue disorder - and studies  bioinformatics at Ghent University. He loves quantum gravitation, modeling, cycling and most animals. Some team members asked him to join the project since his head could be of use for the prototype of the watercollector. He agreed.
Chari Vandenbussche
After three years of focussing on the theoretical side of science and gene technology, Chari decided to brush the dust off her love for computers and programming – that she discovered in high school, but neglected afterwards – and started a master in bioinformatics. She joined the iGEM team to experience playing with science and knowledge in an outside-the-box kind of way. When she is not busy studying or attempting to make Fusion 360 do as she likes, she can be found in the pasture with her horse or reading a book in any position that is comfortable for the next five minutes.
PI's
Wim Van Criekinge
Wim Van Criekinge graduated in 1994 as a Chemical Engineer from the University of Ghent, Belgium, where he also earned his Ph.D. degree in Molecular Biology in 1998. Today he is part-time Professor at the same university, where he is head of the laboratory for computational genomics and bioinformatics (Biobix) in the department of molecular biotechnology. In 1997, he was co-founder and director of Devgen, a successful public biotechnology company.
Marjan De Mey
Marjan De Mey is one of our PI’s. She totally agrees with this quote: 'Manipulating microorganisms makes great fun. Manufacturing with them is just rewarding. Making people to work on that is the aim.'
Yves Briers
Yves Briers is passionate about the potential of the synthetic biology of modular proteins. Contributing to the iGEM team UGent is therefore a great pleasure!
Advisors
Steven De Blieck
Steven likes fun things. He is driven by curiosity and combines this with his knowledge of technology in his work. He likes travelling, making silly jokes in improvisational comedy and doing adventure sports. He dislikes cooking and duck face selfies. He wants to do iGEM because it’s a great opportunity to learn new things in uncharted territories.

Christine Dah-In Chung
Christine is a second year undergraduate from South Korea, pursuing a major in Computer Science and minors in Economics and Political Science at NYUAD. She decided to participate in the iGEM competition because it provided the perfect opportunity for her to learn new concepts outside of her own academic field. Stepping outside of her comfort zone, Christine had to face some difficult challenges, but her overall experience has been extremely rewarding and enjoyable so far.
Sannia Farrukh
Sannia is a sophomore from Lahore, Pakistan, pursuing a major in Biology. Her interest in the iGEM competition arose from her interest in synthetic biology. She wanted to gain experience in the practical aspect of the subject outside of the classroom. Although it was hard and new in the beginning, she found the entire journey extremely enriching and enjoyable.
Muhammad Osama Khan
Osama is a sophomore from Pakistan, pursuing a major in Electrical Engineering. With interests in engineering and synthetic biology, iGEM provided the perfect platform for him to merge the two areas together. The competition also allowed him to apply his skills from the chemistry lab in the realm of synthetic biology. Overall, he found the experience to be extremely rewarding, allowing him to discover new fields where his engineering and chemistry skills can be applied outside their traditional domains.
Alejandra Trejo Rodriguez
Alejandra is a sophomore from Mexico pursuing a major in Computer Science and a minor in Interactive Media. This is not her first experience with iGEM. She participated in the competition in high school and loved it so much that she decided to continue in university. Ale, as her friends call her, is very passionate about science and art, so she never misses the opportunity to mix the two of them together.

Yuheng Li
Student
I first knew SMS iGEM team by reading their attractive poster. Ever since high school, I was fascinated by biology and have been looking forward to conducting research in a team, as I already have independent research experience in biomedical science. In our iGEM team, I not only participated in lab but also assisted with writing articles and designing prototypes. During the half-year experience, there are so many times when we had to deal with unexpected results and faced the consequences of carelessness.  That’s how I gained valuable insight on teamwork and experiments. In addition, although my friends called me a bio-nerve, I also have my own hobbies such as singing and playing guitars.
Yuzhi Lu
Student
I have a wide range of interests, including painting, cooking, tennis, and so on. Among all of my hobbies, I am most interested in biology, so I chose to join the IGEM team in my school for the opportunities to operate experiments. In the IGEM team, together with other teammates, I make a little contribution to the whole progress of our project. Although I once worked with some university students on the production of virus in the liver cells, I still think our IGEM team is a better group. We are not just simply operating the experiments for academy; instead, we are using biology to help other people. This makes me feel that we are transferring out knowledge into something useful for the world.
Ziyi Gong
Student
Fascinated by the delicate world of cells and molecules, I regarded all those tiny bacteria, as well as other eukaryotic cells, with love. Even few days after I had a surgery in my stomach, I devoted to experiments, trying to demonstrate their might with my lovely teammates.
Jiaming Cao
Student
This is Jiaming Cao, aka Maria. Initially when I still knew nothing about genes, I started to feel synthetic biology a really cool subject. And as I learn more and more related knowledge, I could confirm that playing with genes and working in labs are really of great fun. Genetics provide me with an entirely new territory of interests, which pumps me to a new world of exploration. Besides biology, I also like violin, magic, space and travelling. All kinds of things give me inspiration of life.
Ye Chen
Student
The first impression I had about iGEM is the closed door of its laboratory in our school and its colorful poster that presented what gene engineering could achieve. But when I finally enter into that “mysterious” room, I was at once fascinated by it. Besides the scientific research in iGEM, I also did research about environmental science this summer. I appreciate these experiences much since they enable me to comprehend science better.
Jin Huang
Student
I am a grade 11 student in Shenzhen Middle School and mainly do experiments in our team. I knew iGEM from the posters on the wall of school’s corridor. I found it is unbelievable that we can directly work on DNA. I have always been being always interested in tiny things, both atomic nucleus and nucleic acids. Furthermore, I am an environmentalist love life science; so I join the iGEM team of our school. During this yearlong preparation, I learnt a lot about molecular biology, met great difficulties, and conquered them together with my teammates. I am grateful that iGEM competition not only help me learn, but also help me grow. Besides what I mentioned above, I like travelling, meeting great scenery in wilderness and celebrated architecture in cities.
Ziya Wang
Student
I am interested in biology and I have a good time working in the lab. Besides, I enjoy jogging and reading very much.
Yuxuan Yao
Student
I can still remember the day I met genetics. I was totally shocked when I first heard that scientists had already built up synthetic lives (even they are pretty tiny). I imagined that I saw the first life was created in the ocean or whatever it was from. That day, I saw the beauty of genetics and that’s the beginning of the relationship between genetics and me. Besides, I like to read, ride bike, and collect postcards.
Yingqi Wang
Team Leader
iGEM brought me a lot of fun. I was fond of the competition since it was a project completely decided and done by students ourselves. I love the feeling when operating genes, like I can build creatures. I gained much experience in this year and grew a lot. This year is and will be one of the most treasured experience in my life.
Yufei Zhu
Student
She is a student form Shenzhen Middle School. The aim she came to the group is just for fun, and in fact, sometimes she doesn’t know what she will do in the future. Since the students don’t have much time to do modern biological experiments in school, most of her parts in team are in the laboratory.
Although there is not so much time besides study, she did as much as time permits.
Yuxin Wang
Student
My name is Wang yuxin (Doris) and I come from Shenzhen. I first got into science in my biology class when I was in Grade 5. Last semester, my friend recommended iGEM to me and I started my trip to the biological genetic study. For me, doing biological experiments is not only about discovering something new but also about spending time with my friends. Beside doing experiments, I enjoy playing musical instruments and reading.
Meiyi Long
Student
I first encountered the word “gene” is from an article about genetically modified food. After searching for information about genes, I was so shocked that human already have the power to change genes---a nature rule that has existed since the beginning of all organic life. I started to follow the steps of genetically modified food with interest, but then after I came to Shenzhen Middle school, I learned that we can not only change genes, but also create life by ourselves. I was amazed, and that was why I attend IGEM program----every time when I was doing the experiment, I felt like I was doing something meaningful and create miracle.
Yinjia Xuan
Student
This is the designer in SMS-iGEM. I like biology and art a lot, which is the reason why I chose to attend iGEM. In these several months, I learnt some knowledge of synthetic biology, and also practice my design skill. Furthermore, learning web design is also an amazing and new experience for me. I have some other hobbies like traveling, watching movies and animations.
Zixuan Xu
Student
My name is Zixuan Xu and I am mainly responsible for theoretical design and mathematical modeling in the team. I got into genetic engineering because I believe it is a technology that would be the focus of the 21st century. I am interested in exploring how physical and computational model can be used in other fields of disciplines, so I joined iGEM to gain experience in other fields of study. Other than that, I enjoying watching anime.
Yuxuan Li
Student
I enjoy doing experiment in the cool laboratory with my teammates. And I enjoy the moment when I know I finish my experiment successfully. After attending iGEM, my school life becomes much more interesting.
Chengjin Zhuang
Student
I am taking charge of the HP program of iGem nowadays and I really find the experience joyful with no regret. When I learnt from my friend, Laetitia, about iGem, I could not help becoming quite interested in such competition. It is the one that takes students as professionals while giving them serious challenges, and it does contribute to the society in some way. As I am always willing to explore and broadcast new discoveries to the world, iGem really meets my need and brings lots of fun. I have planned the construction of the group, sent our passages, and organized interviews outside during the last seven months. Though the work needs our effort for the whole year, none of our members get bored in the process. I am proud of our team and firmly believed that we will eventually bring some benefits to the society.
Siqi Yang
Student
Biology impressed me after doing an experiment about observing the mitosis of onions in a lab.On account of it，I am amazed at lives and I am strongly curious about living things’ working system. Due to an occasional chance，I got into iGEM competition which is different from others.It does emphasize innovation and creativity, so later I joined the team which I made many new friends and was exposed to some unknown theories. Gradually，I can do experiments by myself. Besides, I did human practice delightedly. Thanks to the team，I really gain a lot.
Yuqiao Li
Student
I’m Yuqiao Li, and I’m responsible for Wechat account in our team. It’s meaningful and delightful to work with other team members, because everyone is so friendly and adorable. By joining this team and working on material about iGEM, I learnt a lot about synthetic biology and gained a huge amount of interesting biological knowledge. Besides, in this team, I focus on human practice. Therefore, I got chance to know how synthetic biology can be used in people’s daily life, and finally I realized the significance of synthetic biology in development of many facet. iGEM is a really meaningful event for me, and I found it pretty exciting as well!
Jianyuan He
Primary PI
I am He Jiayuan，graduated from Beijing Normal University at 2013 and then started teaching biology at Shenzhen Middle School. Since then, teams from Shenzhen middle school have participated in IGEM for 3 years in a row. In 2015, former instructor was on maternity leave and I became their temporary instructor. For the past year, I am responsible for safety of the lab, purchasing necessary materials, applying for reimbursement and so on.

Meet the people who make awesome stuff
Fun, happy, likes parties, says random comments, bunny lover, drummer, sassy
Carmen is one of the most helpful and nicest persons you can meet. At first she can be a bit quiet, but once she gets comfortable, she can be the funniest party-goer. She has had an incredible growth during the project and when you get to know her, you discover a pretty amazing girl who loves concerts and rock bands and who will amuse you with her random questions. We have never seen her angry and she is always smiling, but be careful, her smile is contagious!
iGEM fact: She knows everything about other teams’ wikis.
Random fact: She loves bunnies and she also juggles in the lab.
Carmen Padilla
Bioengineering
Strong, gamer, sweet, love, hugs, IT/computer science, expressive.
Meli is the strongest member of the team and that’s what makes her a true Pokémon Master. She is sweet, loves hugs and she is always trying to make everyone happy. She dreams to be a computer scientist as well as a bioengineer and we are sure she will rule the world because she knows how to get what she wants when she wants it. Her ability to play video games is undoubtedly what makes her unique. If she is angry just get her a chocolate muffin, drop it slowly and run for your life. Her soul talks with the voice of Navi.
iGEM fact: She is our certified DNA purifier.
Random fact: She has Pokémon clothes and loves dying her hair.
Melissa González
Bioengineering
Dedication, passion, responsible, organized, belly dancer, runner, coffee lover, baker.
One thing that’s for sure is that without Caro, we wouldn’t be here. Our team leader is a proactive member who enjoys a good cup of coffee while getting everything done. Caro is like Wonder Woman, she can move her hips like Shakira while she is running marathons for homeless kids and baking cupcakes to build her future multinational bakery. Although she is a great leader, she has had to learn to delegate responsibilities because she is the definition of impossible multitask. Caro has a great sense of responsibility and one of the best attitudes of the team, as she is always willing to listen to everyone’s ideas (even if they are a little bit crazy). We all know that her dedication, hard work and passion will take her to unimaginable places, and once she gets there, we all want to be there to see the better world she created.
iGEM fact: It’s her third time participating in iGEM and she loves it like crazy.
Random fact: She is proud of showing an old picture of her when she was a chubby kid.
Carolina Elizondo
Bioengineering
Careful planner, intelligent, realistic, honest, dramatic, semi-god like explaining skills, map lover.
We can all affirm that iGEM wouldn’t have been the same without him, he’s the one who keeps us focused on the goal because he’s not afraid to take up more responsibilities to support the team. Chuy is a complete drama queen but he is also the smartest guy you can meet. If you want to ask him anything about cute little plants, rare diseases, exotic animals or anything about life and the universe, he is definitely your man. He is always deep, thoughtful, impatient and caring; he can be a little bit of a hater sometimes, but somehow he still manages to make us love him endlessly.
iGEM fact: He is our expert on iGEM history.
Random fact: He eats everything in front of him, if you leave a pen in front of him he will unconsciously chew it until it’s useless.
Jesús García Lima
Bioengineering
Committed, fun, smiley, optimistic, happy, dreamer,  christmas lover, great listener, nice, caring, leader, sweet.
Ale is the nicest human being you will meet in your life. She will always bring a smile to your face when you are feeling sad and she’s the best at listening to other people’s problems (specially if they are security guards). Don’t let her sweet looks and perfect outfit and makeup deceive you, because she is also a great leader since she is not afraid to tell everyone what to do when it is needed. She is the one who keep us organized and definitely the one you look for when you want to get anything done. Ale is also the most social person EVER, she knows everyone everywhere and she has the gypsy-like ability to know your Zodiac sign the instant she meets you. Ale also has the title of being the most huggable person ever, which is perfect because she loves hugs more than anyone, so whenever you see her, don’t be afraid to give her a big bear hug!
iGEM fact: Ale helped the 2015 Tec-Monterrey team during the summer, but she had to go Singapore to study abroad.
Random fact: She has this weird condition in which everyone looks just like an iPhone: TOUCH.
Alejandra Vela
Bioengineering
Creative, focused, intense, funny, reggaeton dancer, tequila lover.
Yili is the most hard working person ever, without her we don’t know what would have happened with the project. She is extremely efficient and knows how to get things done because she is very realistic and honest, and God knows that’s what we needed on the team. Her sense of humor is unique and it only compares with her love for dancing. Also, her playlist of old school mexican hits is one of the most requested ones at the lab! She is definitely the person you want by your side during a crisis, but she is also the one you invite to the best party of your life.
iGEM fact: She made an amazing drawing of a kid for our Human Practice.
Random fact: She is the best at creating science memes.
Yili Natalia Padilla
Bioengineering
Dreamer, independent, random, proactive, creative, funny, positive, crazy.
Carlos is the mind that gave birth to the idea of our project, without him we would be doing something to do with mangoes or moringa. He is a very unique person and his ideas are complex and difficult to describe, just like him. He’s willing to err in everything he does until he accomplishes what he wants to do. The definition of random is underestimated when you meet him because as one day he can ask you deep questions about life, the next day he could convince you of investing all of your savings in our project.
iGEM fact: Carlos has contacted several members from other teams just to get to know them, we don’t know if that’s creepy or cute, but well, it’s Carlos.
Random fact: He once tricked part of the team into thinking they were only going for food and instead he took them to a nearby town to look at the stars.
Carlos Vásquez
Bioengineering
Trustworthy, mysterious, religious, serious, inquisitive look, responsible, patient, resourceful, alpha male.
Raúl is the big brother of the team and that’s not a surprise because he has had time to train with his 10 siblings at home. He is a very kind person and when you need something you know you can trust him with your life. He is also the most photogenic member of the team, seriously, every move he makes is a profile picture. What makes him special is that he is the carrier of the good vibes of the team. We have reasons to think he was raised by ninjas because he has the supernatural ability to disappear without anyone noticing, however, he always chooses one lucky one to say goodbye to.
iGEM fact: For some reason, he has an unearthly disdain to make agar plates with antibiotics.
Random fact: The Ancient Prophecies state that, if Raúl chooses you in three days in a row to say goodbye before disappearing, you’ll have good luck for an entire month. (It has never happened so far).
Raúl Garza
Bioengineering
Innocent, nice, cute, smiley, loves dancing, heart breaker, creative, optimistic.
She is the heart of the team, lovely, cute and innocent. Her tenderness warms the entire team. She is always willing to help in everything she can. Sometimes her ideas are possible in an impossible universe, but we know these thoughts will turn her into the finder of the most amazing and unbelievable discovery we could ever imagine. We have seen how being in iGEM has helped her to open up with others, and we love that!
iGEM fact: She has an uncanny talent for making the world’s cutest Wall-Es, which she proved in our Human Practice.
Random fact: At 2 am, she starts to transform into this crazy little monster who screams at everyone and only wants to eat (beware: she bites :P).
Melissa Rios
Bioengineering
Loyal, handsome, fit, social, loves partying, sensitive, gentleman, funny.
Marcelo is our sweetest member. We can describe him from a cartoon lover, to a gentleman who will always open the door for you, and go to your rescue if you are in need of help. He will be in your worst moments because he is a great listener and he can really understand what you are feeling, almost like if he were feeling it too. He is a rebel without a cause, he is always complaining about the system and he hates routine with all of his heart. He can be a little bit insecure sometimes, but we know he is a great asset to this team and full of potential.
iGEM fact: His lab coat is the most comfortable one, so every team member loves to use it.
Random fact: One of his dreams is to get as fit as Tarzan so that he can take off his shirt to save a damsel in distress under the rain (don’t judge us, judge him).
Marcelo Álvarez
Bioengineering
Intelligent, hard-working, kind, efficient, organized, funny, happy, argumentative, perfectionist.
Suria is perhaps the nicest person you can meet. She is always smiling and willing to listen to others. Don't let this fool you, though: her intense dedication is what really defines her. We all know that she will go far, becoming a recognized scientist in the not-so-distant future. But that's not her goal. She wants to understand the world; her genuine curiosity is what all scientists should aspire to. She also has the talent of being completely honest while remaining constructive and polite, giving us enough confidence to trust her with more private things than we should. Vegetarian from birth and TED-connoisseur extraordinaire, Suria is more than her beautiful laughter, incredible advice, and brains of a goddess; she is also the greatest friend you can have.
iGEM fact: She has the almost magical ability to prepare perfect Petri dishes without even looking.
Random fact: A tip to conquer her love is to perform magic tricks in front of her.
Suria Itzel Morales
Bioengineering
Smart, creative, sweet, fun, gamer, food giver, optimistic, IT God.
If it wasn’t for him, you wouldn’t be reading this. He is the computer science mind of the team, always giving advice and being there when the team needs a hug or food. Carlos was the one who created the wiki and helped the whole team to go through the tough days with words of wisdom. He sings High School Musical songs and dances better than all the girls together in the team. You will definitely love his sweet attitude towards life and his rage quits when the code doesn’t work.
Igem fact:  He can make every code work in a matter of hours.
Random fact: He has a meme for everything and has the 721 Pokémon in existence registered in the Pokedex.
Carlos Frutos
Information Technology Engineering
Engineering Physics student, smart, curious, kind.
Javier is our youngest member. He’s only in his third semester but has been going to courses ahead of his study plan. He is very dedicated and passionate about math and learning. In fact, he got into the team in a very curious way: he was invited to one of the “training” sessions and got instantly interested into Systems Biology and modeling. He is the analytical part of the modeling team and without him the model wouldn’t be as good as it is. He is always a very nice and kind person. He was somewhat shy at the beginning but not so much right now. One thing he keeps doing is not knocking on the lab door, instead he places his head against the glass and waits for someone to see him (the door is magnetically locked and it is made of glass but it’s not fully transparent).
iGEM fact: Every time he receives a voice note, he panics thinking something could have gone wrong with the math model.
Random fact: His last name is almost the same as his home state (Nayarit).
Javier Naya
Engineering Physics
Physicist, smart, reliable, computer whiz, multi-task, wine taster, coffee addict.
A strange mixture of chemistry, math, and physics; he functions like a science utility knife. Since is studying both engineering physics and chemistry, he hasn’t only done the mathematical model but helped in the design of module III. He can always find a different way of tackling a problem, meaning he always manages to teach us something even when we’re all stumped. Above all, he is a rational thinker, yet his optimism in our project is only surpassed by his commitment to it. He is also very well versed in math or physics jokes, so don't be afraid to ask him one if you see him.
iGEM fact: All the girls are jealous of the curves of his math model.
Random fact: His biggest dream is building his own Iron Man suit.
Javier Montemayor

Luis Mario is a vocational teacher, he loves to learn everything he can about any topic from Pi digits to all the Pokemon in existence. He is the sarcasm king and even though he is serious he has a joke almost for every situation. He helped the team in almost every lab situation as well in giving advice in the construction of the biobricks.
Luis Mario Leal Garza
Miguel Ángel graduated from his Master in 2013 here at Tecnológico de Monterrey. He is currently working at CITES, the research unit of our Hospital’s University developing a Stem Cell therapy for Diabetes as well for other diseases. He has helped us in the lab with advices and transformation protocols. This is his first time at iGEM, he loves bread, pizza and coffee.

Lactococcus lactis, a generally recognised as safe (GRAS) bacterium commonly used in food production, is highly amenable to genetic manipulation. We aim to develop a synthetic L. lactis-based platform that can deliver proteins to immune cells to precisely influence the host immune response for use in the treatment of various diseases. Potential applications which we have investigated include vaccination strategies and macrophage modification. We have developed the platform as a vaccine against leishmaniasis, a neglected tropical disease increasing in geographical distribution. LJM11 is an immunogenic salivary protein of the sandfly vector, Lutzomyia longipalpis. Our inexpensive platform, through simple oral administration, has the capacity to deliver this protein to antigen-presenting cells, and potentially immunise against the life cycle of leishmaniasis. Besides vaccination strategies, this platform may be employed to modify the phenotype of other phagocytic cells associated with diseases such as cancer.

Seema Subedi 3rd Year Genetics Student
Like most of the team members, it was my first time taking part in iGEM. During the summer, I gained a vast amount of knowledge on lab research and what it entails. In fact, it has fueled my passion to do research work in future. It’s also a great platform that allows you to focus on activities where you can interact with the public. The outreach section was highly educative as it forced me to push my boundaries and do things I wouldn’t have thought of before like, animating and skydiving. When I am not in the lab or the library, I am often found editing videos or kickboxing.
Regina Walsh 3rd Year Biomedical Science Student
I have always had an avid interest in pursuing a career in research.  iGEM was the perfect opportunity to gain first hand experience of what such a career would entail. Working as part of a multidisciplinary team in a laboratory environment for three months was very enjoyable and I have learned so much. When I’m not pipetting I enjoy baking and spending time with my dog Molly.
Brandon Malone 3rd Year Pharmacy Student
This is my second time doing iGEM having also been on the team last year. I have always enjoyed science as it has given me the freedom to explore the wider world from a molecular level. Having being introduced to synthetic biology a year and a half ago, I was hooked. Not only could I explore life on the molecular level but also modify it from the genetic level with the ultimate goal of providing benefit to man. I enjoy iGEM because it is an all round experience, it is not just lab work for the summer, it is an amalgamation of lab work, public engagement and human practices and therefore unlike anything else! In my spare time, I often go the gym.
Amy Bergin 3rd Year Genetics Student
iGEM Was my first real taste of research work as it was my first time participating in a research project. iGEM was such a great opportunity and gave me such an insight into what life as a researcher would be like if I choose that as my career path. Apart from science, I have many other interests such as baking, playing piano and being with my friends.
Kevin Ryan 3rd Year Pharmacy Student
This is my first time participating in a research project. iGEM has given me a great insight into the trials and tribulations of the research world. Through my time in iGEM I got experience in the day to day running of a lab and the workflow of a research project. In my spare time I like to play the violin and piano.
Donnacha Fitzgerald 3rd Year Pharmacy Student
I entered iGEM to get a taste of synthetic biology and the research world. I believe that scientific research is one of the few careers in which you have the opportunity to achieve things society has never achieved before, and the ever-expanding field of synthetic biology is the perfect landscape to do so. What’s best about iGEM is that it gives the team the freedom to make the project decisions, and also the opportunity to seek advice from helpful expert advisors. This contributes greatly to the development of both the independent and interdependent skills necessary for modern research. Outside of college and research, I enjoy getting to the gym regularly and watching tv series.
James Christopher Meeke 3rd Year Medicine Student
I have always loved learning how the world works, and so iGEM sounded like the perfect way to fuel this passion for discovery. Like most of the others, it was my first research project, and it gave me a lot of insight into the world of biology which I had hitherto only ever read about in textbooks. Outside of science, I also love playing volleyball and guitar.
Aoife O’Brien-Horgan 3rd Year Medicine Student
This is my second year in iGEM and it is safe to say that I cannot get enough of synthetic biology! This competition has given me unparalleled access to an all round lab experience which has only encouraged my already huge interest in research. I have been extremely fortunate and I have met a lot of other students who share similar interests, many of whom I am friends with since the Giant Jamboree in 2015! It is incredible to see people coming together from various disciplines to work on a project; it highlights just how inclusive the synthetic biology community is. As a result of my iGEM experiences I am definitely considering a career in research. When I am not in the lab or hiding under a pile of books, you will most likely find me doing Taekwondo or kickboxing, which I have been doing since I was 3!
Amy Keane 4th Year Biomedical Science Student
I was first introduced to synthetic biology in lectures in second year, and I was completely captivated by the concept. iGEM has given me incredible opportunities to pursue this interest in synbio and develop my lab skills. This is my second year involved in iGEM as I had such an amazing summer last year I couldn’t resist the opportunity to take part again! When I’m not researching or studying for my final year exams, I am in the gym or with friends.
Leanne O’Sullivan Biomedical Science Graduate
I have been a member of Corks iGEM team in 2014 and 2015. This year I helped the team outside the lab, by teaching kids about synthetic biology with fun practical activities at a Summer Camp. I am graduating this year in Biomedical Science and am interning at a hospital laboratory aiding a Medical Scientists to carry out diagnostic tests on patient samples.
Paul Ryan Computer Science Graduate
This is my first time taking part in such a large-scale project and it has given me experience in collaboration which will help me greatly when I enter the workforce.
Supervisors
Yensi Flores Bueso PhD candidate, CCRC
Initially, my goal was to provide the team with a background in Neglected Tropical Diseases and supporting the team's research and human practices agenda. However, as for today, my role is to enjoy the amazing experience of interacting  with such an extraordinary and talented group, from whom I learn constantly!                   I want to be part of a generation of scientist that together, through an open innovation, create novel and sustainable solutions to current health, social and environmental problems. I believe that synthetic biology gives us the opportunity to do so.I like to be involved and an active participant of initiatives promoting social development, sustainability, education and social justice. I do so by engaging with several charities and societies, for which I am a member, or by raising independent projects,  such as the case of GlowDx, a startup aiming at developing diagnostics for neglected tropical diseases tailored to the needs of developing countries for which I am a co-founder.
Dr. Cormac Gahan Senior Lecturer, UCC
I have a keen interest in using synthetic biology approaches for the development of novel live bacterial vectors for vaccine delivery. In particular my lab has created Lactococcus lactis and Listeria monocytogenes (attenuated) strains with significant potential as vehicles for safe vaccine delivery. Properly designed bacterial vectors can have the ability to stimulate appropriate immune responses through engagement with toll like receptors and to drive antigen presentation via class I and/or class II pathways. Furthermore bacteria can replicate at mucosal sites driving local immunity. It is our goal to use rational synthetic biology approaches to optimise live bacteria as vaccine delivery systems.
Dr. Mark Tangney Principal Investigator, CCRC
Mark is a Principal Investigator within the CCRC where he heads a research team investigating various anticancer gene therapies. His interests include developing new, safer ways to treat cancer, using microbes (bacteria & viruses) that grow within tumours. His research in this area has attracted significant media attention, and he is a frequent guest speaker at international conferences. Mark has published extensively in the field of cancer gene therapy and microbiology, and serves on numerous national and international scientific committees and journal editorial boards. He has worked for a number of years at various international institutions (Copenhagen, Los Angeles, Boston), and has joined forces with a large network of like-minded laboratories around the world. As a result, this collaborative research is advancing rapidly towards patient treatment."

TEAM
Meet our (crazy) team!
Hey everyone! We are MIT's 2016 iGEM team consisting of 12 students studying anything from biology and chemical engineering to writing and math. We are a fun-loving, cell-growing, biology-doing group of students that've all worked very hard this year to help further research in the field of women's health. We are excited to show you what all we've done, but first meet the MIT iGEM family!
The Team
Kathleen Brandes
Kathleen is a sophomore majoring in both electrical engineering/computer science and math at MIT. She is excited for working with many field experts during this year’s iGEM project to understand endometriosis and hopefully provide a better treatment option. She is interested in synthetic biology’s circuit-like approach to understanding biological systems, and hopes to apply what she learns from this research experience towards robotics work in the future. Outside of iGEM, she pole vaults for the MIT varsity track and field team and holds a leadership position for the Microbiome Club. She also enjoys cooking delicious desserts, photographing wildlife, and reading science fiction novels.
Damon Berman
Damon is a sophomore from New York majoring in biological engineering. Always trying to make other people’s lives better, he is excited to use synthetic biology to more effectively diagnose and treat a disease, and he hopes that iGEM will be the first of many projects of this type that he works on. A former cross country and track runner, he still enjoys running as well as playing basketball, badminton, hockey, and ultimate frisbee. He is also a brother of Theta Chi, where he serves as rush chair and risk manager and enjoys hanging out, playing video games, and watching movies with friends.
Liz Strand
Liz is a junior at MIT majoring in Biological Engineering and minoring in Chemistry. She is enthusiastic about this year's project in endometriosis because she's always wanted an opportunity to improve the lives of people inflicted with a chronic disease. Through iGEM, Liz hopes to gain knowledge in the many applications synthetic biology has with diseases, and to learn the skills needed to begin a wet lab project and carry it out to completion. In the future, Liz wants to apply what she's learned from iGEM to an independent project or continue the team's work in Endometriosis. On the MIT campus, Liz also is a member of the student group, SaveTFP, and plans to increase her theatrical make-up skills through helping with the MIT Shakespeare Ensemble. She also enjoys baking, reading, and exploring both Cambridge and Boston.
Theresa Machemer
Theresa is a sophomore majoring in Biology and minoring in Writing. She first heard about iGEM through some guy who she hasn’t seen since, and only managed to apply because her friend in Electrical Engineering & Computer Science forwarded her the iGEM email that was sent to the EECS mailing list. She didn’t know anything about circuits or synthetic biology before iGEM, but this year’s project- improving the state of endometriosis diagnosis and treatment methods- is really exciting, and it’s a great opportunity to learn about synbio, lab work and the project design process. In her free time, Theresa crochets mini dolls for her Etsy store, plays violin, and writes for Odyssey.
Sarah Caso
Sarah is a sophomore majoring in Chemical-Biological Engineering. She’s always had a strong interest in chemistry and became particularly excited about biology during her first semester at MIT. She joined the iGEM team to learn about how engineering can be applied to solve biological problems and to gain wetlab experience. The project has sparked her interest in developing new approaches to cure diseases, as this year's iGEM team is striving to build a biological circuit to cure endometriosis, a disease formerly only cured through surgical procedures. Outside of iGEM, she enjoys sailing for the MIT Varsity Sailing Team, cooking, playing the clarinet, and exploring Boston.
Archis Bhandarkar
Archis is a junior studying Biological Engineering and Electrical Engineering at MIT. Systems and synthetic biology attract him as fields that can provide the tools to unravel the innerworkings of complex biological systems. In the future, he aspires to be part of the ranks of physicians and surgeons ushering in a new era of genomic medicine. His dream is that patients with currently intractable genetic disorders can someday walk into his care and receive the treatment they need.
Julia Goupil
Julia is a rising junior majoring in Biological Engineering at MIT. She’s excited about this year’s project, developing a genetic circuit to detect endometriosis, a complex disease that is poorly understood. She looks forward to carrying out the project from start to finish while gaining wet lab experience. Outside of iGEM, Julia plays for the MIT Varsity Women’s Soccer Team and enjoys reading, hanging out with friends, and eating lots of ice cream.
Maya Kaul
Maya is an MIT sophmore from Tetazoo.  She is (by current calculations) majoring in bioengineering and plans to minor in EECS, while maintaining a decent fangirl standing for mechanical engineering.  She is interested in gene editing and delivery systems to make applications of synthetic biology more viable.  Current topics that pique her interest involve an alternative to FBS, cultured animal products, and cell penetrating peptides for gene delivery.  In whatever time she steals violently from the work she should be doing, she appreciates janky carpentry, janky electronics, and very not janky ropework.  She likes exploring, writing, and finding fun people who will tell her stories.
Wangui Mbuguiro
Wangui is a rising senior from Maryland studying Biological Engineering at MIT. Wangui was drawn to iGEM by the prospect of being able to design a project from start to finish. In the past, Wangui has lived two separate research lives. In one life, she explored her curiosity through research in the fields of neuropathology and oncology. In another life, she created and repaired devices as a student in Health, Sciences, and Technology and later as a Biomedical Equipment Technician. She is excited to be fusing the curious and creative sides of her to create a genetic circuit to detect endometriosis, a condition that affects 1 in 10 women. In her spare time, Wangui loves reading, writing, and running. Her other passions include planning events for Black Women’s Alliance, a community that has always supported her, and fundraising for Expediting Access to Standard Education, a club that supports education projects in developing countries.
Gizem Gumuskaya
Gizem is an architect and a masters student in Computation at MIT’s Department of Architecture. She is interested in exploring Synthetic Biology in order to develop scalable living building materials for construction in extreme environments. She is very excited to be practicing SynBio in mammalian cells as there lays many opportunities for synthetic tissue engineering. She plays the cello, sails in the Charles River / Atlantic Ocean and swing dances in her ""free"" time that she manages to hijack from Architecture, Design and Biology!
Colleen Foley
Colleen is a rising sophomore in Biological Engineering at MIT. In the future, she wants to work on developing technology that will help people live better, healthier lives. While she is still not sure how she will accomplish this yet, she is excited about being introduced to the field of synthetic biology through iGEM. She enjoys working on such a high-impact project to develop a diagnostic for a disease that is highly misunderstood. Beyond academics, she enjoys seeing dogs, exploring Boston, and eating chocolate.
Trinh Nguyen
Trinh Nguyen is a rising senior at MIT majoring in Biological Engineering. She comes from Vietnam and is a transfer student from a community college. Currently, her areas of interest include synthetic biology, microfluidic technology, and organ-on-chip. Trinh is a member of the MIT 2016 iGEM team, whose research topic is developing genetic circuit for endometriosis detection. Her iGEM subgroup team focuses on characterizing recombinases which function as biological latches in the final project’s circuit. In addition to iGEM, she is also a co-founder of the non-profit Math & Science Summer Program (MaSSP) in Vietnam. This program aims to promote STEM education focusing on bringing more hands on experience to the high school students in Vietnam. MaSSP conducted a beta testing program in summer 2016 with computer science and math. In the next two years, Trinh hopes to bring the first biology summer program to Vietnam. Besides academia, her goal for this year is learning how to swim. Her favorite sports are badminton and squash.

Promoter Engineering Subgroup Attributions
All estrogen and progesterone sensing constructs were designed and created by the members of our subgroup. Entry vectors for constitutive promoters (hEF1a), repressors (TAL14, BM3R1,TAL21), fluorescent genes (eYFP, BFP, etc.), and activators were provided by the Weiss Lab. All experiments on our promoters were performed by members of our subgroup and conceived by us the students. The student on our team who proposed the  minCMV architecture with upstream binding sites for the ER and PR was inspired by a class he had taken with Prof. Ron Weiss, Biological Circuit Engineering Laboratory, where he had done some basic promoter engineering work in yeast. The cells we sought to test our promoters with (MCF7, ISH, tHESC) were not available in our host lab (the Weiss Lab), so we initiated a collaboration with the Grifith Lab at MIT, affiliated with the Center for Gynepathology Research. Christi Cook and Linda Stockdale of the Griffith Lab provided us with the cells, as well as best practices for culturing and stimulating them. Prof. Linda Griffith and Prof. Ron Weiss advised us during lab meetings where we would present our data. Postdoc Brian Teague of the Weiss Lab was our direct supervisor in case we ran into any difficulties with our labwork; he also helped us initially optimize the transfection of tHESC using electroporation when we ran into difficulties with cationic lipid transfection.
miRNA Sensing Subgroup Attributions
All experiments were performed by members of our subgroup and conceived by us the students. All cloning was performed by members of our subgroup. The design, creation, and testing of pDest_mCherry was spearheaded by us after initial inspiration from Weiss Lab postdoc Brian Teague. Entry vectors for constitutive promoters (hEF1a), repressors (TAL14, BM3R1,TAL21), fluorescent genes (eYFP, BFP, etc.), and activators were provided by the Weiss Lab. miRNA sensors were provided by graduate student Jeremy Gam. tHESC cells were provided by a new collaboration we initiated with Prof. Griffith in the Weiss Lab. Postdoc Brian Teague of the Weiss Lab was our direct supervisor in case we ran into any difficulties with our labwork; he also helped us initially optimize the transfection of tHESC using electroporation when we ran into difficulties with cationic lipid transfection.

All experiments were performed by members of our subgroup and conceived by us the students. All cloning was performed by members of our subgroup. Entry vectors for constitutive promoters (hEF1a), repressors (TAL14, BM3R1,TAL21), fluorescent genes (eYFP, BFP, etc.), and activators (VgEcr, rtTA) were provided by the Weiss Lab. Sequences for the recombinases with nuclear localization sequences were obtained through a collaboration with the Boston University Wet Lab iGEM team. Postdoc Brian Teague of the Weiss Lab was our direct supervisor in case we ran into any difficulties with our labwork.

What We Did In This Summer
In this summer, we aimed at degrading PET biologically with two kinds of newly-found enzymes PETase and MHETase.
We modified the enzyme PETase to improve its activity and used R-R (Reporting and Regulation) system to make the expression visible and regular.
We used microbial consortia to continue degrading the products TPA and EG to carbon dioxide.
We also introduced Cyanobacteria to the microbial consortia so that the system can work with only optical energy and carbon dioxide. We also use CFPS(cell-free protein synthesis) system to assay the enzyme activity.
In the Human Practice part, we spread out our project and the glamour of synthetic biology and receive financial help from some corporations.

Max van't Hof
Hi! After doing the bachelor Life Science & Technology and being board member of the study association for one year I'm currently doing the master Life Science & Technology. I'm the science manager of this year's team. For me iGEM is a nice practical application of my master and also a good way to learn more about other subjects like policy & practice, fundraising and design.
Stefan Marsden
After my Bachelor in Chemistry at the University of Basel (CH), I was looking for a new challenge which I found in the Life Science & Technology Master and the iGEM competition. Biotechnology is a powerful tool to drive innovation towards greater sustainability in the chemical industry. My role is the scientific specification of our construct and hardware requirements for it to be put into practice. During my free time I fence saber on national level and I recently participated as a dancer in a theater production.
Tudor Vlas
Hey! I enrolled into iGEM because I saw it as a really challenging project, especially with respect to my background. I finished Automation and Computer Science at UT Cluj-Napoca (Romania) and am currently doing a Management of Technology Master's at TU Delft. Within iGEM, I am responsible of the Wiki and help with Policy and Practice efforts. I like to play football, video games and meet people from all over the world.
Samantha Basalo Vazquez
After completing my Bachelor in Chemical Engineering, I switched to the Master Life Science and Technology as I became intrigued by the eco-friendly production of useful products made by bacteria. With a prior background in chemical modeling, the position of modeling manager was the best fit for me! Besides my studies, I enjoy painting, swimming and travelling.
Hector Sanguesa Ferrer
I am an enthusiastic student from Morella, Spain, who is working hard for the Master program in Life Sciences and Technology. After some years studying my Bachelor’s degree in Barcelona, I moved to Delft looking for new experiences in biotechnology. Here I had the great opportunity to join the iGem team, where I am responsible of safety issues and lab management. In my free time, I enjoy doing sport and reading;  I could say I enjoy playing football as much as I enjoy science.
Michelle Post
Ciao, I am an ambitious, motivated and open-minded student with interest in both the biotechnology and science communication. Being the policy and practice manager gave me the excellent opportunity to explore both sides; a perfect combination between science and communication. Besides iGEM I really enjoy singing in my jazz band ‘The Bowties’, cooking delicious dinners for my friends and drinking wine or Belgian beers.
Liana Uilecan
Hi! I am Liana, a Computer Science Engineer from Romania. I am currently doing my Master in Management of Technology. I joined iGEM because of its multidisciplinarity long term project. I am the team leader and part of the wiki and policy and practice teams. Along iGEM I enjoy travelling and cooking (eating :) ) delicious Italian and Japanese food.
Marit van der Does
Hi. I'm a third year bachelor Nanobiology student . The reason I joined iGEM was to get more practical experience. I learn a lot during my study programme, but I also wanted to learn how to use that knowledge. I am the Public Relations Manger of the team, but I also help a lot with the modelling and the lab work.
Anne Rodenburg
I'm a fourth year student, studying biological and medical laboratory studies. I joined the team to gain more practical experience, and insight in different subjects. Together with the entire team, I believe that we'll be able to set up a great project. I am the Fundraising and Budget Manager of the team.

Tianjin is a municipality directly under the central government of the Peoples Republic of China, national center city, super big city and economic center in the Bohai Rim, the first batch of coastal open cities, advanced manufacturing base of the national research and development, the northern international shipping core area and the precursor of the reform and opening. Tianjin is located in the north China plain and confluence of five tributaries of Haihe River, lying to the west of Bohai sea, in the north of Yanshan. Her mother river, Haihe River winds through the city. Tianjin rises up due to grain transportation since the ancient times. On November 21, Ming Yongle 2 (on December 23, 1404) it formally settled. This city was the only one which had the exact time record of the founding among the entire Chinese ancient cities. A long history of 600 years, makes Tianjin unique because it has both the characters of Chinese and the western countries, of the past and the modern times.
Tianjin University ( TJU ) is a national key university directly under the ministry of education, whose predecessor is the Peiyang University. It was founded in October 2, 1895 and it is China’s first modern university. TJU has a good reputation both at home and abroad for the school motto, ‘seek truth from facts’, the monument school spirit, ‘rigorously do scholarly research’ and the tradition of patriotic dedication. In terms of the academic achievement. TJU gives priority to engineering research and combines it with science research, making efforts on the multidisciplinary coordinated development of finance, management, literature, law, education and other subjects. The chemical engineering and technology disciplines ranked first in China’s universities. In recent years, TJU’s researchers have made great achievements in biotechnology and synthetic biology."

What We Did In This Summer
In this summer, we aimed at degrading PET biologically with two kinds of newly-found enzymes PETase and MHETase.
We modified the enzyme PETase to improve its activity and used R-R (Reporting and Regulation) system to make the expression visible and regular.
We used microbial consortia to continue degrading the products TPA and EG to carbon dioxide.
We also introduced Cyanobacteria to the microbial consortia so that the system can work with only optical energy and carbon dioxide. We also use CFPS(cell-free protein synthesis) system to assay the enzyme activity.
In the Human Practice part, we spread out our project and the glamour of synthetic biology and receive financial help from some corporations.

Press
What if we could spread our project idea in media and press?
That was one of the first questions that our team asked, and the   answer was: yes! The first report was launched by the brazilian website TechMundo   (World Technology) in May 2016 and named “Algaranha: Brazilian create webs   from algae to heal burns”. The report highlighted the project objectives and   explained the iGEM competition.
The paper “Chimeric spider silk production in microalgae: a   modular bionanomaterial” was released on June 23rd 2016 by the innovative,   open access journal RIO (Research Ideas and Outcomes). This paper explains the   project idea, emphasizing the possibility of exploring the modular characteristic of   spider silk proteins and describes the methods to achieve it.
The report entitled “Ready to Compete” was publicly   released in September 2016 by ‘Pesquisa FAPESP’, a magazine published by   São Paulo Research Foundation with a current circulation of 44,000. The   report describes the iGEM competition, our project and the lack of funds that was   faced by our team. It was also discussed the devices created and made by our team,   as the microcentrifuge, made from MDF panel, and a DNA electrophoresis buffer tank,   made of acrylic. This report was published in print edition and online, shared in   academia through a workshop, reaching brazilian researchers and students from the   Univesity.
All these press coverage have significantly contributed to the   crowdfunding (you can read more in the crowdfunding link) and increased group   visibility. The reports were also shared in our social media, and the received   positive comments encouraged us to keep our focus on the project and face the   obstacles.

Crowdfunding
During the project development our team launched two crowdfunding   campaigns to obtain financial support through the following platforms: Vakinha and   Dodo Funding. The first is a national platform and the aim of this campaign was to   receive financing by reaching out friends, family, companies, universities and   people interested in science in Brazil. In order to attract investors we provided   gifts according to the donated amount of money, which included stickers for credit   card, bags, shirts, glasses case, a kit to build a microscope and the game of genes   (developed by the team USP- Brazil in 2013). As a result, we have raised R$ 7,471.00   (U$S 2,134.00). The raised money was lower than expected, but it helped to finance   lab costs and some traveling expenses of some group members to the Giant Jamboree.!
The Dodo Funding campaign aimed the international community and   resulted in U$S 144.69.This money was very helpful for the registrationfand banner   payments, which allowed us to participate in Fablearn Brazil 2016, a brazilian   conference about digital manufacturing (you can read more about this project at   human practices Gold   Criteria ).
During the campaign, we faced some challenges, as difficulty to   promote the project and short deadline to raise funds. In order to overcome these   issues, we sent many e-mails to companies, science websites, journalists, brazilian   newspapers and tried to disseminate the campaign to the largest number of people as   possible. These tasks enabled us to create strategies to prepare campaign material,   and to understand the opportunities and responsibilities that are involved in the   project marketing. Even if we did not get the money to fund the trip for all group   members, we consider crowdfunding an excellent way to generate funds to iGEM   project.
As we countdown the days to the Giant Jamboree, we would like to   thank all the people that have contributed to the project, supported it and believed   in us. We are very grateful to everyone. In return, we expect to bring some   knowledge about synthetic biology with our project and also contribute to the   brazilian science. Here follows the name of the ones that supported us:

Team Training and Project Start
Stanford University is well equipped for synthetic biology work, as an undergraduate Bioengineering program with several lab courses exists in full force. Brown University offers a Synthetic Biology Course every other year taught by Gary Wessel. We alternated between using Dr. Lynn Rothschild's lab at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and the open-resource Uytengsu Teaching Center in Stanford's Shriram Center for Bioengineering and Chemical Engineering. Most of the members on the Stanford side of the team became acquainted with bioengineering lab work through BIOE44 (Fundamentals for Engineering Biology Lab). This course is generally taken as a sophomore, and some of our team members took it during the fall quarter of 2015-2016 (9/21/2015-12/11/2015). Materials for this course, such as the syllabus, are readily available online: here is an example from 2014.
Our team had brainstorming meetings and cross-continental team Skype sessions beginning in March 2016, where we stitched together rough subprojects and the overall theme of bioballoon. Our work in the lab did not start until the beginning of June 2016, when the Brown students ended their spring semester and travelled to California to work with the Stanford side in person. Stanford students got to lab after finishing their spring quarter in late June. All projects were begun by the Brown students, and ended by the Stanford students during the regular school year as the Jamboree approached."

PROJECT
The Last Colinator
The human microbiome – the totality of all on and in us living microorganisms represents about 2 kilos or     4 pounds of our body weight. The world of microorganisms has by now left specialized laboratories or ancient     textbooks and reached the minds of people every day. The awareness about bacteria-human interaction increases steadily.
The market for probiotics is booming, resistance against antibiotics causes losses in billions each year,     not to mention human health effects. At exactly this point our project sets in. Our goal is to develop new     metabolic pathways which allow our test bacteria to utilize nutrients more efficiently, to degrade toxins or     to produce new antibiotics. To come straight to the point our project, called „The Last Colinator“, is dealing     with selective pressure, spontaneous mutation, antibiotics resistance and the finding of new selection markers.
To reach this goal it is not enough to sit back and wait for the bacteria to do it on its own, the mills of     evolution grind slowly. The driving force of evolution is stress in form of changing environment conditions     as food shortage, changes in climate, natural enemies etc. Exactly those evolutionary conditions we are about to simulate.
On a culture dish – the arena – we spread out two different bacteria strains – the competitors. Each strain     is equipped with certain skills which are harmful or which give it a protective shield against the competitor.     That may be the ability to produce a toxin, to grow faster, to have better defense mechanisms etc.      Those abilities are genetically determined by genes and therefore can be modified by molecular biologic methods.     We are modifying our genes of interest in a way that they are more prone to mutagenesis by environmental stress      and are thereby more effective in adapting on changing conditions.
Altogether 4 different strains of Escherichia coli are used and created, different features each.     Strain 1 for example comprises ccdB/ccdA genes (toxin-antitoxin-system), a DAM methylase gene and a     chromoprotein gene for the visible tracking. Every strain receives its own characteristic chromoprotein genes,     as well as, toxin/antitoxin genes. Every stain gets the DAM-methylase gene, though. The DAM-methylase leads to      increased spontaneous mutation.
The environmental conditions like nutrient availability, temperature, pH etc. are chosen in a manner     to generate highest possible stress for the bacteria, this will push evolution additionally. At the end     one strain will be the sole survivor. The reason for its survival will be the fact that it developed a way     or an ability to adapt faster or more efficient to those harsh life conditions. That may now be a new antibiotic,     a new metabolic pathway for toxin degradation, better utilization of nutrients or many more. Furthermore, innumerable     selection markers are created. These markers can later be utilized in various projects, e.g. at the creation of recombinant proteins.

Project Design
The BeeT project consists of multiple parts, every student has their own part. We tried to integrate all the modelling with the wet lab. Therefore our project has three main categories, sensing the Varroa destructor, toxin production, and safety.
Wet lab
Lisa searched for the Bt toxin inside dead mites. Therefore we needed beehives from which to collect Varroa samples. Dead mites were collected from the beehives of the Duurzame Bij, a beekeeping organisation which tries to do beekeeping without pesticide use by breeding for Varroa-tolerant honeybees. They have some of the only beehives in the country with large populations of Varroa mites. Henk Kok, secretary from the Duurzame Bij, helped Lisa with the mite collection. We learned how to collect live Varroa mites and work with honeybees from Tjeerd Blacquière and Delphine Panziera. After the first few weeks, we were able to gather mites independently. It was a nice learning process and we learned how to avoid getting stung by bees. They also provided valuable input on honeybee research. Steven Aalvink gave a short instruction on the brightfield microscope. Sjef Boeren operated the Orbitrap for LC-MS/MS and provided instructions on how to prepare samples for proteomics. Kees van der Ark supervised Lisa's work.
Linea made a library of the toxin, she got some help in the lab from her supervisor Franklin, who explained how to work in the ML2 lab. Jaccoline made vesicles with advice from Vera Silva. Jaccoline also worked together with Linea. She learnt about DLS (dynamic light scattering) from RG. Fokkink who also explained how to analyse the data. With this information Jaccoline could analyse her results. Carina made the Varroa sensing system based on sensing mite poop and vitamin B12.
Thomas made a quorum sensing system and a subpopulation system. Thomas was supervised by Franklin during the building of this system and testing it in the lab. Daniel Gerngross made the RBS library with RedLibs algorithm for Thomas. Thomas tested this RBS library in the lab himself. Tjakko Abbee from the  Food Microbiology group at Wageningen UR gave him permission to use the FACS for free. Marcel Tempelaars from this department helped Thomas to do flow cytometry, he explained to Thomas how it worked and did the measurement together with him. Before that Thomas tried to do FACS in Leiden with help of Paul van Heusden but unfortunately this was unsuccessful.
Belwina used Cas9 to improve a biocontainment kill switch. To design the genetic circuit, she was helped by her supervisor and her second supervisor Franklin. Her supervisor Alex also helped out with lab work by handling the FPLC machine. Ioannis Mougiakos recommended the Expresso system for getting Cas9 expressed in the right amount for doing in vitro Cas9 assays. Prarthana Mohan Raju helped by advising on how to perform the assays and cloning and expressing the gRNAs.
Marijn made the light kill switch in the lab and he did also light measurements in the beehives. Marijn got some help from his supervisor Marta. Tianhe took care of making a toggle switch and combining the light kill switch and sensing system together. Tianhe got help from his supervisor Stamatios
Modelling
Mario modelled the light kill switch which, he got advice of how to do dynamic modeling by his supervisors Emma and Rob. Remco modelled the interaction between the BeeT, Varroa, and Bees to investigate how BeeT would spread through the hive and affect the mite and bee population. His teammate Ronald explained to Remco how to use R and also helped him with bash related problems he encountered in the process. His supervisors Rob and Emma gave him advice.
Angelina modelled the quorum sensing subpopulation system. Her teammates Remco and Ronald helped her with some of the problems. Her supervisor Rob gave her advice on how to make the model and Ronald worked on the metabolic modelling and an in vitro toxicity assay, he got help from his teammate Thomas when he went into the lab. He was supervised by Maarten Reijnders.
Human Practice
Carina is our Captain Human Practice, Carina forms the Human Practice team with Linea and Belwina. As one of the first things they did was get in contact with Beekeepers association in Wageningen (NBV). Together with them we tried to think of a solution for the dying bees. We have a collaboration with Synenergene where an application scenario was generated. A movie about synthetic biology has been made for the RIVM. We also had a collaboration with the Design Academy Eindhoven, where Thieu Custers made our product design.
Wiki Construction
Lisa is the Wiki Captain, together with Ronald, Remco and Tianhe the design of the wiki was made. We got advice from the Rik van Rosmalen on making the Wiki. Lisa made all the illustrations herself and together with the guys did most of the programming work. Every team member worked hard to get his/her personal pages on the wiki.
Finances
With Angelina as our Treasurer, the finances were managed together with Jaccoline for the crowdfunding. For the crowdfunding we got help from Arianne van Ballegooij, she told us how we could sell ourselves the best. Mario looked for the plane tickets and accommodation. As a team we searched for sponsors and got advice from our supervisors, specialists at the university and previous iGEM team members. We searched all together for sponsors, we asked the previous Wageningen UR team which companies they would recommend us to approach.
Other Team Roles
With Thomas as our Team Captain the whole team functioned well. Of course he had much help from his secretary Belwina. Linea is Captain Facebook, nothing is more important these days than presenting yourself on social media. Marijn is our lab safety manager who took care of keeping the lab safe and clean.
Presentation
During the iGEM project, we had multiple presentations. We organised a presentation open to all people, staff and students, at Wageningen UR. The help we got with the preparations was from the supervisors. They sat together with us and helped us with our presentation skills. They also commented on the presentation slides, told us what was clear and what was not. Impulse provided us with a venue and sponsored lunch during our public presentation.
Supervisors
Dr. Christian Fleck, prof.dr. John van der Oost,  dr. Robert Smith, Kees van der Ark, Maarten Reijnders, Stamatios Damalas, dr. Marta Vazquez Vilar,  Emma Keizer, Alex Kruis, and Franklin Luzia de Nobrega. Our supervisors!
Advisors

The Genspace team is made up of community members.
There are four adults on our team, all from various walks of life and none with advanced degrees in biological sciences. None of them had ever practiced synthetic biology prior to joining Genspace, and they have learned the science through our classes and through iGEM participation.
There are thirteen high school students from local schools on the team. They came to Genspace because their schools could not afford to support high school teams and they really wanted to learn synthetic biology and be part of iGEM. None of them had any prior independent hands-on research experience. Genspace has a mission to provide for students like this so participation was on a first-come first-serve basis.
The final three college students spending the summer in New York, all of whom are majoring in the sciences at universities. We consider all of these people part of the New York community we serve.

Members of the Genspace iGEM team did all the part design, wet lab work, wiki development, and will do the poster and presentation material generation. Mentors offered advice and training in both lab safety and lab techniques and proofed the final submissions (wiki, registry) but did not participate in lab work. DNA that our team modified to make into BioBrick parts and composite parts were synthesized for us by IDT. A member of Genspace (Ali Schachtschneider, a professional designer) who is not on the team helped us design the team logo.

TEAM
The 2016 Kingsborough team consisted of several students and faculty mentors. The work was truly done as a team, with a core of students having a helping hand in almost all aspects of the project, and gaining experience with a number of laboratory techniques.
The Kingsborough Core (Students)
The core of the team (in rough order of contributions) was comprised of Alex Dean, Jessica Zhao, Wendy Zhao, Jonathan Nedd, Julian Zhao.
This core team performed all different laboratory tasks: restriction digests, ligations, transformations, PCR reactions, ran gels, and prepared media. Jessica (along with Wendy) helped to keep things organized and employed a color-coded tube labelling scheme for most experiments. Brainstorming sessions and discussions between this core helped to develop the project idea, plan experiments, and troubleshoot problems.
In addition to lab activities, Julian Zhao and Alex Dean also wrote the abstract for the Kingsborough team and completed the safety form, and worked on the format of the Wiki. They both contributed to writing / designing the poster.
Jessica, Wendy, and Jonathan Nedd explored the context of the project's implementation by visiting a local wastewater treatment plant.
Helping Hands
Jonathan Pinkhasov helped in some of the early laboratory work, as well as provided input in the process for producing a poster. Anjelica Buchanan also contributed to some of the preliminary laboratory work.
In addition to some of the above, several students also helped with the initial design of the DNA sequences for the three new genes we hoped to introduce into E. coli; these students were Jeren You, Luana Johnston, Sandra Hardin, and Haitham Alnagar.
Faculty Mentors
Professors Devin Camenares, Grace Axler-Diperte, and Sarwar Jahangir all helped supervise the team's efforts in the laboratory. They all provided guidance regarding various protocols, as well as advice on how to troubleshoot experiments and organize notes.
In addition to the above, Prof. Camenares wrote the code for a short program that was used to optimize the DNA sequences.
College Suport
The Department of Biological Sciences has supported the iGEM since its inception, providing the lab space and access to common equipment which was useful in completing some of the experiments.
A special thanks to the Office of the President of Kingsborough College, who awarded a Faculty Innovation Award to Professor Camenares for the express purpose of aiding the development of the iGEM team. These funds were instrumental for registration of the team.
The Office of College Advancement worked with Professor Camenares to try and secure additional funding sources for the team, as well as promote the team through the college.
The Office of Student Life also worked with Professor Camenares and the iGEM students that doubled as Biotech club officers (in particular club president Jason Meyers) in trying to secure funding specifically for travel to Boston and Jamboree registration.
Vendors, Suppliers, and other Partners
A special thanks to Integrated DNA Technologies, which provided free of charge all the DNA synthesis we used in the project; this includes all three anammox genes used, spacer/accessory DNA for Gibson assembly, and various primers for PCR and sequencing.
NEB provided a discount on some useful enzymes for the project, and BioBasic also provided a discount on some lab supplies, kits and enzymes."

Meet The Team
We are six enthusiastic students, dedicated to exploring the potential of synthetic biology. Along with our mentors Daniel Winter and Dr Christopher Marquis, we have combined our skills from many different backgrounds to form the well-oiled machine that is the UNSW Australia iGEM team.
Team Members
Jessica
I'm a science student majoring in microbiology and pathology, and I'm very passionate about scientific research. My particular research interests include the gut microbiota, stem cells and synthetic biology. I was attracted to becoming involved in the iGEM competition because I saw it as a great opportunity to think creatively, and to learn and practice research independently.
Gavin
Over my years at Uni I've flitted between many different fields of science, though I finally settled on Genetics and Psychology as my majors. I've contributed to projects on hallucinatory stimuli, and regulatory genetic elements in the brain. Recently that interest extended to Synthetic Biology; I enjoy how it aims to make applying biological knowledge standardised, controlled, and logical, as well as the breadth of cool projects you can apply it to.
Charlotte
I am a keen, undergraduate student, and have thoroughly enjoyed exploring many different areas of biology (from working to conserve Flatback marine turtles to working with stromatolites) during my time at UNSW. Synthetic biology recently appealed to me as a novel way to make a real impact on conserving the environment through the development of new tools for researchers. When I'm not busy in the lab, you'll find me hunting down a new café or specialty coffee shop!
Maddie
I am a second year science and law student, majoring in molecular and cell biology with a particular interest in the emerging field of synthetic biology, and the novel applications this area of research could develop to solve world issues. I am also fascinated about the intersection between science innovation and law, and the policy implications of emerging technologies on society. I became involved in iGEM as a way to independently develop these interests in a creative and meaningful way.
Shivani
I am a second year pharmacology and microbiology student, passionate about making an impact on the world of science. I am interested in developing innovative solutions to improve human health and the quality of life, and I see synthetic biology as a way of achieving these important goals. iGEM allows me to look at global issues in a more creative way, by brainstorming and independently tackling problems that impact the world we live in.
Gordon
I am a 2nd year undergraduate science student, double majoring in molecular and cell biology and bioinformatics. My passion lies in both the fields of software engineering as well as biological research. This emerging discipline of synthetic biology has caught my interest particularly as it will allow me to apply computational science to biology. I find it fascinating how detailed yet simple the genetic code of life can be, and I would like to contribute to the expanding knowledge of it.
Our Mentors
Daniel
I am native of Rio de Janeiro and have travelled around the globe pursuing my studies. I completed my BSc and MSc at Université Paris Diderot in France and I am now a 3rd year PhD candidate at UNSW Australia. I'm passionate about teaching, systems biology and synthetic biology, which led to my involvement in UNSW iGEM - it's the second time around I'm advising an iGEM team at UNSW and we're getting better at this!
Chris
I did my PhD in biochemical engineering a long time ago, in the area of producing monoclonal antibodies in bioreactors. Since being an academic I have worked on many collaborations with industry and other academics in areas that include protein production and purification, nanobiotechnology and bioremediation. Through iGEM I have become a fan of synthetic biology and the potential for interdisciplinary collaboration to create amazing things."

Introduction
Our project was the product of a number of people’s contributions and hard work. On this page we would like to acknowledge the efforts of our team, advisors, supporters and the like. Each and everyone of these people and groups were integral additions to the Waterloo iGEM 2016 project.
2016 Team Members Idea and Project Development
This year we conducted our project brainstorming and development in 3 parts to incorporate the entire team. Since our team consisted of 34 students we decided to first narrow down our potential projects amongst the project director and 4 sub-team leads in February. Through internal brainstorming among our leads team, the first iteration of our “OFF to PriON” project was established.
The foundation of the project idea was then further developed in the second phase of our brainstorming with the rest of the students on our team in early March (click here to learn more about our team). Our team consists of students in programs ranging from biochemistry to nanotechnology who each brought a number of perspectives and knowledge bases.
The third phase of our development consisted of detailed design of the execution of our project which consisted of experimental design, modeling potential and human practices research. The bulk of the project design phase ended in May with ongoing modifications made throughout the season as necessary. Execution of these plans began in June and continued on until late September. The project itself was developed independently by the students on the Waterloo iGEM 2016 team and executed throughout the summer with support in the following areas.

Cameron Roots LinkedIn
Kevin Li
Cameron grew up in the North Kitsap area of Washington State, eventually making his way to the University of Washington. A rising senior, he served the main wet-lab portion of UW's iGEM team as the ultimate lab monkey—taking on tasks anybody else lacked the time or confidence to complete—before continuing on as BioBricking co-lead. Cameron joined iGEM seeking the in-lab versatility to complement his knowledge-versatile majors: Biochemistry and Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental Biology. While his educational inspiration stems from the self-coding language that is DNA, Cameron steps away from science for his leisure, enjoying Dungeon and Dragons, PC gaming, hiking, playing guitar, public speaking, and more.
Been with the UW iGEM team for around 4 years, which makes me an old man practically. Currently serving as an advisor and webmaster. I handle the wiki and parts of dry lab as well as administrative duties, which include recruiting and team member management. I presented in 2013 in Toronto at the North America Regional Jamboree. In my spare time, I am a complete nerd, which shouldn't surprise anyone. Cosplay, DnD, or video games. You can decide, which is worse. I do get out of the house for a run or to boulder. Jokes aside, I am currently going into my Masters in Bioinformatics and applying to Medical School. I hope to get into VR/AR with regards to cardiology.

Natalie Johnston
A Seattle native, Anne started school at the University of Washington in 2015 in pursuit of a Bioengineering degree. This is her first year on iGEM, and she is excited to run gels in the lab and educate youth on synthetic biology. In addition to running experiments, she highlights the global impact of genetic engineering through the human practices team. As a Washington State DECA finalist in six entrepreneurial events, Anne hopes to analyze business potentials in conjunction with human practices. You can often find her with a nose in a book, traversing Washington's trails on her mountain bike or watching nerdy science YouTube videos.
I was born and raised in New Mexico. I am currently in my senior year at the University of Washington completing my degree in Bioengineering. This was my first year with the iGEM team. I focused on the wet lab portion of the iGEM this year. In addition to working on the wet lab team this year, I am also a co-lead for the BioBricking team. In addition to lab work my main hobbies include cooking and exploring different neighborhoods and coffee shops in Seattle. After graduation, I hope to work in education where I can share the information I have learned and inspire the next generation of scientists.

Brandy Tang
A native of Seattle, I am in my senior year at the University of Washington, studying Bioengineering and Violin Performance. This year, I’ve mainly been involved in administrative work for the iGEM team, organizing and attending outreach events, coordinating fundraising efforts, and helping with team leadership. I have also pitched in on BioBricking and other labwork. Outside of iGEM, I am passionate about my research in biomaterials and my volunteer work in STEM outreach programs through the BioE department and her Tau Beta Pi chapter. I am also an avid performer in multiple local orchestras and chamber groups. After graduation this year, I plan to work in the biotech industry or at a research institute while working on medical school applications. In my limited spare time, I enjoy running my Etsy jewelry business and traveling with my family.
Native Bellinghamster pursuing a B.S. in Bioengineering at the University of Washington and seeking to go into the biomedical industry. This was her first year in iGEM and in a lab. Brandy works with the wet lab crew and couldn't be happier. She has mastered the delicate art of loading wells for gel electrophoresis (wow, no more punctures!), remembering to screw on the lid for the centrifuge, and disposing of biohazardous materials properly. In her spare time she can be found either reading, learning to play ukulele, or catching and releasing insects that have strayed into her dorm room. She is one of those people who enjoys splashing in puddles when it rains and going out of her way to step on dried leaves. Winter is her favorite season because she was born in the cold, unforgiving North and it’s where her favorite form of precipitation, her middle name’s sake, can be seen falling from the sky. A couple interesting things that bug her are decorative rugs and mismatched socks.

Sunny (Sun Jung) Park
I graduated from the university’s bioengineering program this June and stuck around to help advise the team and build the project up. I am currently in the Pharmaceutical Sciences Ph.D. program at UC San Francisco, hoping to eventually apply synthetic biology methods to either discover new drugs or elucidate drug-bacteria interactions. While in Seattle, my past times were food hunting, movie watching, and city exploring. Now in San Francisco, my hobbies are food hunting, movie watching, city exploring, and complaining about rent.
Originally from Korea, she moved to Raincouver (Vancouver), Canada when she was in middle school and eventually to the United States for college. She is a senior majoring in Biochemistry and will be finally graduating in 2017. As a wet lab member, Sunny has been struggling to be friends with ""the Violacein"" pathway! Sunny is happy that iGEM has introduced her to the field of synthetic biology. Outside of iGEM, Sunny enjoys watching movies, playing ukulele, and listening to K-pop.
Yoshitaka Goto LinkedIn
Texia Loh
A Japanese guy who grew up in Tokyo, then New York, now at the University of Washington. He is currently a junior pursuing a B.S. in Bioengineering and a minor in Applied Mathematics, seeking to go into the biomedical industry. He is one of the presenters for the iGEM - Washington team as well as drylab lead. Why both? Explanations range from peer pressure to sensory impairment.
Joining iGEM this year, he had no idea what kind of slavery adventure was in for. Delving down the world of chemostats and challenging himself in myriad ways such as asking a bewildered Art Department for dyes for ""some science experiment,"" there are a few things he learned. He has the magical ability to find doppelgangers of previous members of the team. He loves Moon Cakes, Mango Tea, and White Coffee. He can't whistle or snap, but can clap yay. He somehow keeps people off focus and stays helpful at the same time. He has an ongoing argument about Starbucks with the wetlab lead. Makes various sound effects at surprising times. If he had a superpower, it would be regenerating bananas. Always accidentally sounds sarcastic. Despite all, iGEM is love. iGEM is life. As in, iGEM is taking over his life. Send help. If you want to hear serious boring things about this human being, come talk to him at Jamboree! Don't worry—voted as ""A nice guy"" for 5 years running!
Texia hails from the (almost) unknown land of Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Looking towards earning a bioengineering degree, she joined iGEM in her Freshman year, and is one of the presenters for the team. Not only does conducting experiments in wet lab make her happy, she also enjoys the social aspect of the lab, like keeping others company. Interaction with the other members have given her great insights to the scientific world as well as social satisfaction. Part of that satisfaction comes from watching her other two presenter teammates squabble over Starbucks and everything in general.
Raised multilingually, she gets excited whenever she hears another person speaking a language she knows. Also raised as a true Asian, she constantly has packets of food on her at most times (unless it's been eaten) and thinks that it is unacceptable to work on an empty stomach. Therefore, if you’d ever like to have a cup of Chinese tea, let her know! She can and will bring the tea to you, as long as you desire it :)
Anita Elnathan
George Sun
Anita is a junior at the University of Washington and plans to major in Electrical Engineering with a synthetic biology focus. She one day plans to work in industry to combine her love of synthetic biology with her interests in finance and investments. This is Anita’s second year on the University of Washington iGEM team.
This year, Anita has taken on the responsibilities of wet lab lead, chief of finances, and lead presenter for the 2016 iGEM season. She has taken on many roles and is often sleep deprived but nevertheless thankful to be on a team with so many amazing individuals and to grow in her leadership skills. In her free time, she enjoys reading the FT, drinking coffee, and discovering new restaurants on Yelp that she can drag the other presenters, Yoshi and Texia, too.
George, who is participating in iGEM for his first year, is a sophomore studying bioengineering. He started his iGEM career as a contributor in wet lab; now, he works mainly on hardware and wiki design. Specifically, this season his contributions include creating the digital renderings of the team's autonomous control system, engineering and prototyping the many components involved in hardware, and designing the theme and creating content for the wiki. In his free time, he programs, works at the on-campus maker space, volunteers with several student organizations, and researches.

Yang Ping (YP) Kuo
Roya is a senior at International School in Bellevue, Washington. This year she’s been involved in administrative work for the team, ordering sequences, directing a crowdfunding campaign, helping with leadership,  designing biobricks, and helping with project design. She’s also passionate about her work on the UW iGEM website and launching the first high-school iGEM team in Washington with the rest of her team and Anna Vasyura, a student at the Tesla STEM High School. Other than being a member of iGEM, Roya's an avid science blogger, Netflix aficionado, and filmmaker.
YP is a senior at the University of Washington. He majors in Biochemistry and Biophysics. This is his first year at UW iGEM. He drops by once in a while or whenever he's needed. He has experience with a wide variety of fields so he provides ideas that seemed random but sort of useful. YP is from Shoreline, Washington and spent half of his lifetime in Washington.

The 2016 iGEM project was much more than just studying, wet lab work and building a robot. We had a lot of fun besides the work which contributed to a great year and made our team grow closer together. This makes lab work much more fun, appearing conflicts can be solved more easily and a lot of new friendships have been built. We all learned from each other: the physics students got an introduction to synthetic biology, the biology students got in touch with programming, new students learned from more experienced students and vice versa. But scroll down and see what we did during the 2016 iGEM year!
The Start: Kick-Off
In January 2016, the iGEM team started to meet every tuesday and brainstorming about the 2016 project slowly processed. We did some literature research, found a project, discussed it in our meetings and finally decided to carry this project out. The very first team event was the kickoff event. We got to know each other better, introduced ourselves to the team and talked about our ideas and visions for this iGEM year. The team structure was developed and discussed, some team rules were specified and we had a barbecue and a pub quiz.
Workshops
In order to teach everyone about cloning, the BioBrick system and other molecular biology, basics were taught to the new students in various workshops. Several computer programs were introduced, such as SnapGene or the SciFinder.
Hiking
On May 1st, which is a holiday in germany, we went to the Weinlagenwanderung in Zwingenberg. Our way lead us through the vineyards, offering breathtaking views and high-quality wine. We hiked through the Bergstraße mountains, had a picknick and spent a good day together.
Kleinwalsertal weekend
In June, we decided to have a seminar in the Kleinwalsertal (austrian mountains). We climbed a mountain, spent some nice evenings together and developed a first concept for the Human Practices work. This weekend improved our team spirit very much and was a good possibility to recharge our batteries from the lab work!
Guest from Milano
In July, Laura who is a student in Milano (Italy) visited us. She came to see how our iGEM team works and how we are structured. Maybe next year, there will be an iGEM team in Milano, too? We hope that we gave you a good impression and want to say thank you for staying with us!
German iGEM Meet-Up in Marburg
In August, the annual Marburg Meet-Up took place. A delegation from our team joined the german Meet-Up which was organized from the Marburg iGEM team. We got to know the other german iGEM teams, presented our project and talked about collaborations. There, we made some first agreements regarding our collaborations with Aachen and Göttingen and socialized with the other teams. We had a lot of fun playing bubble soccer and camping. Thank you, iGEM Marburg for organizing such a great event!
Team-Building Event
One weekend after the Marburg Meet-Up, we had another team-building event. Our project coordination and project management team organised a ""pokémon-style"" event. We had to catch ""pokéballs"", learn how to throw them and played some mini-games about ""super potion"", took a quiz and let our pokémon fight. Who is the next PokéMaster? iGEM Darmstadt! We finished the day with a nice barbecue and grew even closer together!
Trip to Evonik
In September, we had the opportunity to present our project to the innovation unit of Evonik. We had good discussions, got some feedback regarding our project and had a tour in the Marl Chemical Park. We learned a lot on this day!
Interdisciplinary exchange
What we did from August till October was to work together closely with our robotics team. We exchanged our ideas and visions about the project, especially the hardware part, and advised each other. We made it possible for our robotics team to be in the lab and try some cloning. Our Reporter team leader taught the robotics team how to clone mVenus behind a T7-promoter which was crowned with success! In return, the robotics team gave us some basic introduction to programming with a Raspberry Pi/Arduino. We learned a lot from each other and now, we can appreciate the work from the other teams even more: interdisciplinary work can be fun!
Taken together, we all learned a lot this year. Besides the work, we had a lot of fun, grew together as a team and also got to know many other iGEMers. We worked in the lab every day in the week, had some exhausting nights before wiki freeze and spent good times together. The iGEM year will be completed with our team visiting the Giant Jamboree, presenting our project and getting to know more young researchers-We are really looking forward to the Jamboree, see you there!

A Huge THANK YOU Goes to These iGEM Teams
We would like to thank iGEM Göttingen for helping us to test Minicolicin in other organisms than E. coli, as well as iGEM Aachen for trying to help us with the assembly and characterisation of the orthogonal pair. We had a lot of nice Skype sessions and it was great fun to work with you!
We would like to thank the iGEM team of Texas at Austin as well for constructing their ONBY (o‑nitrobenzyl‑O‑tyrosine) orthogonal pair. We used the open reading frame (ORF) as template and replaced the coding sequences with our own sequences. This helped us with constructing our plasmid, thank you for this work.
We want to thank the iGEM team of Munich for the good collaboration regarding the syringe pump. You sent us your pump so we could compare it to ours and get some more ideas!
We also want to thank the iGEM team from Düsseldorf for organising a collaboration of eight iGEM teams in Germany. All of us designed postcards with biotechnological topics to raise public awareness. We appreciate the effort and hope that this postcard distribution will make people more familiar to synthetic biology!
Finally a special tribute goes to iGEM Marburg for arranging the german iGEM meet‑up. We all had much fun there, got to know other iGEM team members and are looking forward to see everyone we met there on the Giant Jamboree!

Prof. Dr. Heribert Warzecha is a professor for Plant Biotechnology and Metabolic Engineering at the TU Darmstadt. He initiated the iGEM project at our university in 2012 and supported us in all our efforts since then. His research focuses on the production of lipoprotein vaccines in plant chloroplasts and metabolic engineering of plant secondary metabolism with human CYP450 enzymes that have an extraordinary broad substrate acceptance.
Thea Lotz
It’s a pleasure to see your local iGEM team grow over the years. As a former student member, I try to pass gathered experiences in the competition on to the next generations of iGEM’ers. This year’s project uses the best of this competition’s ideas: expanding and improving the toolbox of iGEM, using new ideas, based on well-characterized old parts. But not only the scientific processes of researching and creating are exciting for me, the challenge of forming a functioning team out of students who rarely know each other beforehand is one of my favourite parts of the iGEM project.

Semester: 4
So far I am studying biology in the fourth semster and still I am very satisfied with my decision. As I covered the basics now, I have the chance to follow my interests to gather experiences in the laboratory. This is what I expect from the iGEM-Project.  Working in a team as well as having the ability to develop my own ideas is what motivates me to enhance my knowledge in addition to my regular studies.
Thomas Dohmen
Studies: M.Sc. Biology
Semester: Let us not talk about this.
I will never ever stop participating.
Maximilian Dombrowsky
Studies: M.Sc. Biomolecular Engineering
Semester: 2
It is the second time I am taking part in the iGEM competition and I am looking forward to learn and work with a bunch of exciting people. Unlike last time, my main task will be the work in our modelling department and therefore I will unfortunately just have a small amount of time for laboratory work. I am also hoping to pass on the knowledge I gathered in 2014 to our new team members.

I’m partaking in iGEM this year because I want to expand my knowledge about gene editing and molecular biology as well as practical work in the lab. Independant working and sense of responsibility are my priorities fort he project. It is the first year of iGEM for me and I'm looking forward to learning from the old and new members.
Katharina Geißler
Studies: M.Sc. Biomolecular Engineering
Semester: 1
Hey, I study Biomolecular Engineering in my first Master semester. I am new to iGEM, but highly motivated to carry out our very own synthetic biology project with students from our and other disciplines. I am very happy that I joined this year’s team since we already had a great time together and probably will have during the rest of the iGEM year!
Alana Stephanie Gouveia
Studies: B.Sc. Biology
Semester: 4
When I first heard of iGEM I knew I had to be part of it, I've got flattered about the idea on learning and working with student colleagues in a whole independent way which students are used to in the college routine. I'm very optimistic and excited about our project, the whole team is in syntony and ready to help each other. So far I had only good experiences. I know how much knowledge this project will bring us all and this is for me the biggest reason to dedicate and push myself to the most professional I can get.
Franziska Hameister
Studies: B.Sc. Biomolecular Engineering
Semester: 6
I've heard a lot of positives about the project so this year I wanted to assure myself of these advices. I look forward to great experiences, new friends and an unforgettable time!
Marietheres Kleuter
Studies: B.Sc. Biomolecular Engineering
Semester: 4
This year I am joining the iGEM Team of the TU Darmstadt for the first time. I look forward to gain many new experiences and getting to know people from different places. The most interesting part about iGEM is the work in a team without anybody, who tells you what to do. Therefore we have to deal with upcoming problems and the right solutions on our own. By this way of “Learning by doing” I am convinced to remember the methods and processes easier. Moreover I am happy about the iGEM community, meetings with different iGEM team and some travels, because next to the working periods should always be some free time for socializing.
Claudia Kreher
Studies: M.Sc. Biology
Semester: 3
My motivation to join the iGEM team is to learn how to plan and perform a project by my own or in a group with other students. I also hope to learn how to analyse problems in the lab work and find alternative solution approaches. Furthermore I hope to find new friends and have a nice time with them besides the work in the lab.
Milana Kremenovic
Studies: B.Sc. Biology
Semester: 4
I´m fascinated by the iGem-Team`s performances of the last years and thus I´m glad to learn from the more experienced team-members.  The learning effect is my biggest motivation. It´s amazing how big the learning progress can be, when you have to make concepts, search for solutions and work in the lab on your own.

Working together in a group, having fun and achieving a mutual set goal is what fascinates me about the iGEM Project. And in addition to that, there are many new things to learn, especially laboratoric techniques which are another major point for joining the team. Overall I hope for much fun and new experiences during the project.

My participation at iGEM last year has been the most educational and enjoyable experience of my entire study years. That’s why, naturally, I would love to participate a second time. I’m looking forward to the lab work and a great time!
Tim Maier
Studies: B.Sc. Biomolecular Engineering
Semester: 4.
This is my first time, that I am in the iGEM-Team. Last year I was fascinated by the ideas and their realizations of the ‚iGEM-Students’. Already back then I was sure, I wanted to participate this year.  Within the iGEM-project everybody has the opportunity to develop not only in terms of scientific practice but also by realizing ones creativity.
Patrick Müller
Studies: B.Sc. Biomolecular Engineering
Semester: 4
This year I’m participating the iGEM competition for the first time. By working on a topic of my own interest and throughout various tasks which exceed my university’s curriculum, I’m expecting to improve my own abilities and hope to be able to broaden my horizon.

Semester: 6
After all the positive experiences i made last year and all the knowledge i was able to take from the project it was clear to me, that i wanted to be a part of the iGEM team in 2016. This year as a project coordinator i try to make sure that we run on schedule and reach our milestones in time.
Bianca Reisinger
Studies: B.Sc. Biology
Semester: 6
Last year, I participated in iGEM for the first time. I had a lot of fun and I was able to gather many experiences.  This time I am hoping to pass on the experiences to the new members so that they have a great time, too.  I am looking forward to this years' project and to the challenges waiting for us.
Sabine Schäfer
Studies: B.Sc. Biology
Semester: 4
I heard from iGEM by a chance, but it indeed impressed me so that I'm taking part of the project this year for the first time. I am always interested in new challenges and this project is in contrast to the university everyday life a possibility to work independently or in the group and to do research. I am glad to collect valuable experiences and I am curious about how our project develops during the next months.
Maik Schork
Studies: B.Sc. Biology
Semester: 4
This is the first time I participated in the iGem-Project, which I heard about by fluke and since the first open meeting, I could not get off. The concept of introducing my own ideas in an open project during my early studies fascinated me and I don't regret my participation. It's the first time I can be part of open research, which starts at the recrutation of financiers to the coordination of the project, ending in laboratory work and I'm really looking forward to the next steps of the project. I hope we can tie in with the achievements of the last years.
Inka Schröter
Studies: B.Sc. Biology
Semester: 4
I am studying biology in the 4th semester and am participating the first time in iGEM. I was so fascinated by the older projects that i wanted to take part in one too. Moreover i am enthusiastic about the idea to work independently in a lab and about what i am gonna learn.
Viktoria Schuster
Studies: B.Sc. Biomolecular Engineering
Semester: 4
In the course of this year's project I have developed new skills beyond my expectations concerning not only synthetic biology but also scientific presenting and webdesign. Developing a joint research project frow scratch and working independently to this extent is a special and scarce opportunity amongst students for which I am really grateful. Additionally I am very much looking forward to changing experiences with and getting to know iGEM members from all around the world at the Giant Jamboree in October.
Jannik Schwitte

I am glad to support our iGEM-team this year with my skills and to optimize my own efficiency. I want to gain new working experience and improve my competence in team working, problem solving and working in self responsibility.
Jonas Sindlinger
Studies: B.Sc. Biology
Semester: 6
Hi, my name is Jonas,  I'm 22 years old and this is my second time participating in iGEM. Why do I do this? I believe that iGEM represents the optimal platform to work freely and to learn at ones own pace. The amount of topics in the context of synthetic biology one can experiment here end at the borders of ones own fantasy... or at the boundaries of the labs funds. Although creativity seems to only be heightened if these are low.  In the course of last years project, I had lots of fun and gained a bit of experience. This year I hope to pass some of this experience down to our new generation.
Daniel Stumpf
Studies: M.Sc. Biology
Hey Hey, my name is Daniel, I am 22 years old and currently studying the master degree course ""Technical Biology"", here at TU Darmstadt. This year is my 2nd iGEM  year, but now I have a different requirement profile than in 2015. In 2015 the main focus for me as a rookie was on dealing with the lab work, but in 2016  I concentrate on the support and accompaniment of our (again) very big team. In conjunction with Max and Chris I am responsible for the concept and execution of trainings and seminars for our team members, as well as to support the project design of the project coordination. And of course we organize fun events  (brewery tour, hiking days, barbecuing), because our hard working and cool team deserves these events for being for so long in the labs.
Christian Sürder
Studies: M.Sc. Physics
Semester: 15
It's my third year that I participate in iGEM and it seems that I'm the old guy, literally. The challange for me over the last two years was to build up a team structure, develope concepts to save our knowledge and pass it to the next generation of students. This task is nearly completed and this year I like to focus on winning more students from other disciplines, besides biology. In 2014 we had a great project with a good balance of synthetic biology and mechanical engineering.  The challange for this year will be to get into touch with the other disciplines and show them the possibilities within iGEM and in the field of synthetic biology. Therefor we like to creat opportunities for students to get to know the project and the various challanges biology is faceing. For me iGEM is the most interdisciplinary project in the whole TU Darmstadt and the best chance to work in a motivated and colored project group.
Markus Susenburger
Studies: M.Sc. Physics
Semester: 8
It is easy to describe my motivation behind participating at iGEM. At first, it is quite a technical challenge, and secondly I can learn more about complex biological processes.  During my bachelor thesis, I was involved in automatisation, and I would like to share my experience with the team. As it is my first iGEM competition, I can only imagine, but I think it's also a lot of fun.
Thomas Georg Wagner
Studies: B.Sc. Biomolecular Engineering
Semester: 2
My attention for iGEM was called by a former member of the project and my interest was immediately woken. I´m looking forward to the chance to work practical in the early academic years. I want to work besides planned internships in a dedicated team which finds own ideas and solutions.
In addition it is exciting to handle other parts of the project like finances, PR and organisation in the team. Those softskills are essential for our career but not learned in the regular academic studies.
Maximilian Zander
Studies: B.Sc. Biomolecular Engineering
Semester: 6
Gude, My name is Maximilian Zander and I am studying Biomolecular Engineering at the TU Darmstadt in my 6th semester. I already participated on last years´s iGEM team and gathered a lot of positive experience (not only in the laboratory) as well as networking with a lot of young, motivated students. That’s why I want to be a part of iGEM TU Darmstadt 2016. I am very excited to work on this huge team on own ideas and generate an extraordinary project.
Stefan Zens
Studies: B.Sc. Biomolecular Engineering
Semester: 6
This year I am participating at the iGEM competition for the second time and I am looking forward to the challenges of the new project. Last year I had a great time conducting research on a concrete scientific issue together in a huge team which was an instructive relief from every day studies. This year I would like to share my experiences especially my acquired practical skills with the new team members. I am looking forward to an exciting and hopefully successful project!
Yannik Zobus
Studies: M.Sc. Physics
Semester: 8
Heyho, my name is Yannik Zobus and I am currently studying physics in the 8. semester at TU-Darmstadt. This year it is the first time, that I am taking part at the iGEM-project and I am pretty excited about the collaboration with other students coming from different departments. I am especially fond of the independence, that one has to display in this project  as well as of the interdisciplinarity of this project. Moreover, I am happy to be a part of iGEM-2016 at TU-Darmstadt and I hope to learn a lot of new things outside  the framework of my studies of physics.
Michelle Zöller
Studies: B.Sc. Biomolecular Engineering
Semester: 6
Last year, I participated in iGEM for the first time. During this time I learned a lot about lab work.  As a team leader of a small lab group I was also able to gather some first experiences in how to organize a project like iGEM.  This year I decided to participate once again. But this time I will part of the project coordination.  I am hoping to learn a lot about organizing and coordinating a project like this.
Fabian Drywa
Studies: B.A. Soziologie
When a member of this year’s iGEM Team TU Darmstadt told me about iGEM and asked me to help with their Human Practices project I wanted to be part of this right away. As I am a trained chemical technical assistant as well, I am very interested in biological projects like this one and was very happy to be part of this team. My main motivation was to generate a Human Practices project with the best possible scientific standards.

We attended the 88th Genetic Society of Japan and had a discussion with 5 Japanese iGEM teams (Gifu, HokkaidoU, Kyoto, Nagahama, and UT-tokyo). Our topics were how iGEM Japan would be in the future and reached a consensus of our apporopriate cooperation. We had a good oppotunity to exchange information and to deepen our friendship."

ABOUT THE TEAM
People in our school became aware of the iGEM competition after a school club                     was made under the name “iGEM”. After two years of its establishment and its                     success in the iGEM competition last year, students learned what this club was all                     about and they became interested in it. Hence lots of students gathered in this                     club.
Our team, METU HS iGEM consists of students from different age groups                     and with a variety of personalities. And our diversity is what makes this team so                     vibrant and full of color. But as well as our differences, we also have our                     similarities; we all like biology and creativity. Most of us wanted to join this team                     to obtain an experience in a worldwide famous competition like iGEM, because                     most of us are planning to study biology in the future.
Just like any other team in iGEM, we had our ups and downs during our times of                     work. But eventually we learned that nothing can be achieved without working                     hard and as the time passed we learned to work in union. We accepted our                     differences and became like brothers and sisters with each other. We had quite                     hard time determining our project idea but as we worked harder and researched                     more, we found our most suitable project idea. We love going to the lab and put                     some music on and sing and have fun as we work. We especially love treating                     bacteria that we’ve cloned as our sons and daughters. We had so much fun doing                     our human practices and helped the society to raise awareness about colon                     cancer.
As a team, we think that iGEM is surely more than a synthetic biology                     competition because it provided us to think creatively and improve our problem                     solving skills. We are all glad that we joined the iGEM family and grateful that we met                     each other within this team.

Hi there, I am Tugba Inanc Gok. I am a Biology teacher at  METU High School and primary instructor of METU HS iGEM team. As an educator I am volunteer to any kind of scientific project that gives my students the opportunity to be scientist of future. In that manner doing iGEM in high school is the best opportunity for me and for my students. All iGEM steps and processes require hard working but nothing makes me happier than seeing how fun synthetic biology is and makes students enthusiastic in the field of area. I was always interested in synthetic biology and genetic engineering, but the best part is to explore this world with my students. This is officially my second year at iGEM, me and my team put best effort for our project and are very excited to be part of iGEM family.

Heyy I am Burak, I am a master student at Biological Science Department in Middle East Technical University. After two years with iGEM as a team member, finally I can participate as an advisor and welcome new iGEMmers. Introducing people to science, directing their attention to synthetic biology and seeing their passions are the most attractive sides of iGEM. We got used to iGEM summer works, all its tiredness and distress. Then the project presentation comes closer and experiments are over, all effort is worth the distress. iGEM also becomes full of scientific pleasure. Enjoy doing science!

About Us
Team Queen's Canada 2016
The Queen’s iGEM team consists of fifteen undergraduate students from a variety of different disciplines. Common among all our team members is a passion for synthetic biology and an eagerness to learn more about it while contributing to advance the work done in this field. Having the advantage of being from diverse backgrounds, each of the members has uniquely contributed to our 2016 research project.
Dragos Chiriac
Dragos is in his fourth year of Life Sciences. He is proud to be this year’s official pancake chef and Co-Dictator. When he is not maintaining strict order within QGEM or flipping pancakes, he can be found trying to showcase a harmony between hip-hop and nature with his wardrobe. Viewing himself as the Drake of synthetic biology, this year Dragos hopes to drop the hottest drug of 2k16. In the future, Dragos plans to pursue a career in research.
Jia Tanwani
Jia will be starting her first year of Medicine in the fall at the University of Toronto. This is Jia’s second summer being involved with QGEM. She eagerly joined QGEM in 2015 to be part of a team that works to solve real-world problems and is currently one of the co-directors in addition to leading the Policy & Practices component of the 2016 project. When she’s not teaching synthetic biology courses or sending emails, Jia loves to go shopping and enjoys tagging her friends in Facebook memes. In the future, Jia plans to continue pursuing innovative research that fuses her interests in medicine and synthetic biology.
Danai Topouza
Danai is in her fourth year studying Biology and Computer Science. She saw QGEM as an opportunity to be an active part of an exciting research project, learn more about synthetic biology, and put her programming skills to work. Danai is planning to pursue graduate studies that combine her interests in genetics and computational biology. When not debugging, Danai enjoys spending time outdoors, trying out new restaurants, and watching horrible movies.
Yifei Wang
Currently in his third year of Life Sciences, Yifei learned about QGEM during his second year and quickly became drawn to the innovation, competitive spirit, and paisley shirt cult that is QGEM. He has learned to appreciate not only its lab and research opportunities, but also new skills he never dreamed of mastering, like web development and teaching. Apart from building the dankest QGEM website of all time, Yifei aspires to travel the world and one day sit courtside with Drake.
Kennedy Ayoo
Kennedy is in his fourth year of Biochemistry. Upon the completion of his undergraduate degree, he hopes to pursue a career in the NBA, using synthetic biology to help the Toronto Raptors win their first championship. (This may be the only way the Raptors can win). In the meanwhile, most of Kennedy’s days are spent shoulders deep inside a fume hood.
Matthew Bentley
Matthew is in his third year of Life Sciences. He was first introduced to QGEM through Queen’s most popular and well organized club, the synthetic biology club. He saw QGEM as an exciting opportunity to learn more about the real world applications of synthetic biology, and a good fit for his competitive nature. He hopes to pursue a career in medicine and through QGEM would be a good way to procrastinate studying for the MCAT.
Linor Berezin
Linor is in her fourth year studying Biochemistry. She joined QGEM this year in order to explore her interests in synthetic biology and to collaborate within a team that works towards finding innovative solutions to problems. When not in the lab attempting to isolate natural products from bacteria, Linor can be found sailing around Lake Ontario.
Hillary Chan
Hillary is in her fourth year of studying Biology and Health Studies. Her academic interests span from molecular biology to ethics and humanities. In the field of molecular biology, Hillary is particularly interested in learning how proteins involved in cell communication or signaling pathways can be engineered to produce antibacterial or antifungal drugs. As for ethics and humanities, she enjoys studying how policies or patent protection strategies are implemented for new medicinal drugs. Her diverse interests have led Hillary to volunteer with the 2016 QGEM team. Not only does Hillary find this year’s project to be novel and inspiring, she appreciates QGEM as a platform that combines both her academic interests while enabling her to gain experience in project design, data analysis and interpretation, scientific writing, and collaborating with other students who have similar interests.
Danielle Ciren
Danielle is in her third year of undergrad, studying Biology. She enjoys all things molecular biology, so QGEM was the perfect fit! Being her second year on the QGEM team, Danielle has gained more experience in research design as well as scientific writing and loves the idea of student-driven research. This summer Danielle is contributing to the Policy & Practices component of the project. In her spare time, Danielle enjoys solving puzzles, reading, and attempting to play the ukulele over the protests of her neighbors. In the future, Danielle hopes to pursue a Masters in Biology!
Julia Grein
Julia is in her third year of undergrad, studying Biochemistry with a Certificate in Business. Her decision to stay with QGEM for a second year was inspired by her love for iGEM and Dragos’ pancakes. Her enthusiasm for laboratory work and biotechnology makes QGEM the perfect fit to combine these interests while being involved in the Queen’s and synthetic biology communities. When she’s not managing the Twitter account or editing, Julia frequently saves QGEM from technological incompatibility issues with her Mac-VGA adapter.
Anna Ilina
Anna is currently in her third year of undergrad, studying Biomedical Computing. She loves studying genetics and hopes to learn more about bioinformatics tools by participating in the QGEM team this summer. Anna found out about QGEM from one of her professors and is looking forward to participating in the dry lab team this summer. She once set a beaker on fire and decided that joining the dry lab will be the safest option for everyone. In the future, she hopes to pursue medical research, continue working with technology, and create a recipe for the world's best chocolate cake.
Sabrina Quazi
Sabrina is in her fourth year of undergraduate studies, majoring in Biomedical Computing. Sabrina always has a smile to offer and can more often than not be found chatting up strangers. She is so excited to create a meaningful dent in synthetic biology alongside the very same team that introduced it to her in the first place! Outside of QGEM, Sabrina can be found figure skating, playing NBA 2k16 (very, very poorly), and working with the Queen’s Innovation Connector.
Simran Sharrma
Simran is a fourth year Biochemistry student who is terrible at writing biographies about herself. After realizing she loves research and lab work, she found QGEM to be the perfect environment to collaborate with colleagues on a project that spans every step of the research process. She has found that she thoroughly enjoys all the different components of QGEM and hopes to make an impact with all the work each member has put in. She has also found that, unlike many other team members, she doesn’t care much for Drake and sincerely hopes that this isn’t reason enough to get kicked off the team.
Vinith Suriyakumar
Vinith is in his third year of Biomedical Computing, which makes the QGEM Dry Lab team the perfect volunteer opportunity! He first learned about QGEM through BCHM 218 and was inspired to seek a way to get involved! Vinith is really excited to be a part of the team this year because he loves coding and developing algorithms. He wants to use his knowledge of computing to help combat real world problems armed with the principles of synthetic biology. Vinith is an avid superhero fan with Captain America being one of his favorite movies. A cool fact about Vinith is that he has a first degree black belt
Rajiv Tanwani
Rajiv is in his second year of Life Sciences. He was drawn to QGEM because he wanted to explore the avenues of research in a student-led environment. Rajiv is contributing to the dry lab as well as the Policy & Practices component of this year's project. In his spare time, he enjoys hiking and test-driving sports cars. His future aspirations include becoming an orthopedic surgeon and owning a collection of luxury sports cars.
Byron Hunter
Byron is in his fourth year of Biochemistry, and is also currently a lab member of our principal PI, Dr. John Allingham. When not saving the QGEM team with his expertise in protein purification, Byron enjoys venturing downtown for some late-night hotdogs, or as he likes to call them, ""Night 'Dogs""."

Xinyuan Qiu:
   Hello there, I'm Xinyuan Qiu, the originator of the team NUDT_CHINA. Actually this is my third year in iGEM, and frankly speaking, my college life has been changed a lot due to this amazing event. It's my great honor to have all my team members with me in iGEM 2016.
   iGEM, yours to enjoy.
   
Chushu Zhu:
    My name is Chushu Zhu. I come from a beautiful city named Lishui, located in Zhejiang China. I am an undergraduate at the National University of Defense Technology, major in chemistry. The undergraduate education gave me a wide range of vision and taught me how to cooperate with others. While learning biological knowledge and technique, I also get a sense of other field at the same time. That’s why I join the team of NUDT_CHINA. Synthetic biology is so magical, and my teammates’ brilliant ideas win my great admiration as well. This project offers me a good chance to give full play to my creativity, intelligence and diligence.
   
Jiaxin Ma:
    Hello everyone! My name is Jiaxin Ma, a chemistry bug in its third year of college. I’ve been dreaming of studying biology especially synbio and cytobiology since I was in high school, and thanks to iGEM, I realized this dream of sitting in the lab and working with microorganism. In our team, my job is to carry out experiments, design wiki and direct works as well as give presentation of Human Practice. These jobs were sometimes huge challenges for a greenhand of iGEM like me, but the experience of defeating them with our team and keeping learning new things in this field have given me great happiness.
   
Dongyu Fan:
    Hi, my name is Dongyu Fan. I'm from a historical city, Xi'an, which is a subtle blend of glorious history and modern civilization. Similarly, my character also has two sides, calm and delicate, also warm and lively. The same is true of my hobbies, I have great interest in both humanities and natural sciences, which makes my way of thinking both rational and emotional. This is my first time to participate in iGEM, and it's really a long and hard way from a non-professional person to a qualified experimenter. But to be honest, I firmly believe that the process is more important than the result. In this year, I deeply enjoy the time spending with the team members and also enjoy the fun of playing biology. that is my greatest achievement!
   
Xi Cheng:
    Hello,My name is Xi Cheng,you can call me Emily.Now I am a junior student of Chemistry.I came to NUDT_CHINA iGEM group just because I was deeply attracted by its harmonious experimental atmosphere.Thanks to these days,I could get some points about experiments arrangement as well as biology.Mainly,I have done some assistant experiments and project like cost estimation,interview with doctors,and etc. Now I am a junior student of chemistry, because I am longing for the harmonious atmosphere of the Igem group to come to this group. In the first half of the year, with the sense of laboratory safety awareness and the progress of the experiment, to learn a lot of. In the experiment, some assistant experiments were done, and the HP was responsible for the project cost estimation and the interview with the doctor.
   
Huifang Wang:
    Hi,everyone. My name is Huifang Wang,a member of NUDT_CHINA. In our project, I have a hand in experimental section and cost statistics. It’s an honor for me to cooperate with other members. Thank  iGEM for the platform they offer, which makes me get acquainted with the most impressive young men and give me more exposure to the international environment. Integral consciousness, time perspective and friendship is valuable spiritual wealth I gain among this project.
   
Yuanhao Mao:
    Hello, I am Yuanhao Mao, the chief member of modeling in this project. I am really crazy about mathematical modeling, theoretical analysis and, by the way, major in Optics and Photonics, which seems having nothing to do with biology. I turned a biological behavior into a simple math problem in our project and also designed a program to figure it out in a numerical solution. I am good at abstracting a practical problem in order to solve them into a calculative or mathematical way. I believe physical models and mathematical theories will make a profound influence in iGEM and, even in Biology, in the future!
   
Ruixuan Chen:
    Hi, friends! I’m Ruixuan Chen. In NUDT_China team, I was a member of the HP group. Thank goodness! I could be with you! You are my best partners in the world. I love my team, just as I like POI.
   
Qijie Xu:
    Hi, I’m Qijie Xu. As you see, I am a little plump, the fat on me makes me hate sport. Though I hate these fat, it seems that there is no use to hate them. But for The first time I know iGEM, I know I would be interested in it. As a new in iGEM, it is really a honor for me to join the team of NUDT_CHINA. In our team, I mainly work for Human Practice. By playing too many games, I have my special opinion in games. Because of this, I take part in designing the game. I always believe that the most important thing is not the result, but enjoying the process. Joining this team must be one of the best choices in my life.
   
Yishi Lu:
    Hi, my name is Yishi Lu, one of team members in NUDT_CHINA. As a biology hobbyist, I have been tired of Math, politics and physics. So, iGEM is a paradise for me. I can not only learn more about biology theoretically but also stay up late in lab with teammates. Though there are lots of mistakes, we will not give up, as failure is the mother of success. We have learnt a lot from our faults. That may foreshadow a bright future. Love life, love iGEM!
   
Yue Wang:
    My name is Yue Wang. I am a junior and my specialty is chemistry. My  hometown is a historical and humanistic city ,which lead me becoming a kind person caring people. Out of favor of biology ,I joined this team, after joining a few months ‘experiment and activity about human practice ,not only have I learned lots of knowledge ,but also build my ability .no matter what can we get ,I will always remember this unforgettable experience.
   
Yifan Zhang:
    Hello, I am Yifan Zhang, a member of the HP group. Though I am major in medine, I am really interested in computer science. Welcome to play our game, because I am one of the authors ^_^ Thanks to my partners, I finished it on time. Come on and enjoy it!
   
Yufei Xu:
    Hi, I'm Yufei Xu, a member of team NUDT_CHINA. My attention focused on the part of experiment. I had to say, the processes of biology experiment are so complex that several times I just wanted to give up. But I can't resist the temptation of biology and the felling of finally finishing the experiment.And more, I want to do something for human by myself. So, I'm here for iGEM. I know that we will meet with success.

Attributions
So to whom should the glory and the fame be ascribed to? Who but me? Consider the tireless hours, the blood and the sweat, the agony, the mountain dew, the pepsi cola, and how my tears sprite forth as the ginger ales within me! If not for my endless toiling, what would have been? What is this you say of errors, mistakes and such? Neigh! That is not my portion! Was it not him, she, it and they that were in charge of that? Neigh! All imperfections whether small or large or no fault of mine! They lie solely on the shoulders of others. Neigh to me, attribute only that which is good.

Hello everyone, I’m Tingo, a seventeen-year-old student. My interests include appreciating classical music, reading science fiction novels, and playing badminton. As a project manager, I have to absorb enough knowledge and turn it into numerous practical ideas. The reasons I wanted to participate in iGEM is that I am interested in biology, and I want to use what I’ve learnt to change the world; besides, the competition may add spice into my senior high school life, and even make my whole life different. In iGEM team not only can I meet people who like biology as well and arouse sparks within discussion, but I can also learn how to work with my teammates and finish experiments with cooperation. Since genetic engineering is a potential industry, which can improve the world in medical, agricultural, environmental domains, I want to learn more about the industry in advance so that I have more time exploring the world of genetic engineering. I hope that everyone can benefit from this magical technology.

My name is Chia-yun Yu, I am from Taiwan Mingdao High School. I am very shy to talk to strangers, but I also like to make friends and socialize with my team members a lot. I also like to help others. I have been to the north Thailand to do volunteering work during the summer vacation. My hobby is to play sports. I love to play table tennis and basketball the most in my free time. I decided to join Mingdao iGEM team because I am interested in biology. I can learn a lot of knowledge about biology while participating in the iGEM. Also, I really enjoy doing experiment. Although I had done many experiments before, I have never done the experiment of gene engineering. I think it will be a lot of fun. My job in the team is to record what we do every day. I think I am very suitable for this work because I am very good at it. I am very glad to be a part of the iGEM family.

I'm Mariss, a student in Mingdao High School, Taiwan. I like to listen to classical music, especially music from the late romantic era, like Mahler and Tchaikovsky. The reason that I joined iGEM is quite simple. I am a procrastinator, so here I am. I'm a person who would do nothing when there is no pressure on me; therefore I need some teammates to push me forward. Honestly, I'm not that kind of person who is crazy about molecular biology or even just biology, but in iGEM, I feel like being involved in these activities because it is so much fun!  In the team, my job is to take photos of our lab life, record those wonderful times since I've been interested in photography for quite a time and had taken some really great pictures. I will do my best! For more stories in my daily life, follow me on Instagram @jansons2016 ~~~

Mingdao iGEM 2016
There was a group of high school students in Taiwan, full of curiosity and passion and wanted to do something big. They learn a lot of knowledge from school, on books, from teachers, but instead of learning for tests they wanted to put what they learn into practice. That’s us iGEM Team Mingdao 2016 a year ago, we wanted to do something different and unique in our teenage years, and iGEM is our opportunity to do it. After a year of hard working, we learn skills of doing experiments and how to finish a project. Now, we’re well prepared and can’t wait to show the world our results.

Experiment
In school life I’m confused of the purpose of learning. Perhaps we can get good grades on tests, but we never know how to use them. However, when it comes to iGEM everything becomes different. We are using English instead of Chinese learning biology! Beyond this, we not only learn the knowledge from books, but also actually use the equipment to do experiments. For a student from Taiwan this is definitely a precious opportunity, this is why I joined iGEM. For the first time ever, as a sixteen year old teen I realized that I may got the ability to change the world by synthetic biology with my teammates in iGEM.

My name is CHEN, SHIH-CHEN. Or you can call my English name Erick. I am a senior student from Mingdao high school in Taiwan, hoping to travel all over the world and make friends with all of you. In my spare time, I like to listen to music, and sing songs. My favorite singer and band are Jay Chou and Nine one one. Jay Chou is so talented that he wrote a lot of wonderful songs. And Nine one one is a Taiwanese band whose songs are so close to the Taiwanese native culture. Another crazy hobby is playing basketball, I also like to watch NBA competition, and my favorite team is San Antonio Spurs. Their team work always looks so beautiful.  I am interested in biology and life science. That why I join in the iGEM team. I want to discover more beauty about living things and driven my curiosity on it. I think I am an outgoing man, so my work in our iGEM team is human practice. I’m glad to make friends with you who are interested in biology or have the same hobbies as mine.

My name is TZU-HSUAN LEE，I am a pleasant girl from Taiwan. Sometimes, people think I am weird because of my strange behavior. To put it briefly, I am a naughty and crazy girl to the marrow of my bones. I have intense enthusiasm on things that interested to me. Also, I am talented for drawing and designing because of my marvelous pair of hands. I won the third place in the designer competition last month. However, these are not the reasons that I decide to become one of the IGEM members. What is life? Life is to enjoy, do something you love and make it colorful. But, of course, we need to be conscientious doing everything. And it is why I am here, why I am willing to spend my precious time on IGEM. In IGEM, we can make good use of our imagination and create things that are individual, and of course, to improve the life of people and animal. In IGEM, I believe that everyone should know one thing, ''There is nothing impossible, but something unbelievable!!''

My name is Jeff, a fifteen-year-old high school student. I have a wild range of interests including biology, scout activities, playing the flute, playing sports and so on. Since I’ve been deeply interested in biology, I made up my mind to get involved in our school’s iGEM team immediately after the moment I encounter the iGEM. While participating in the team, I learnt not only specialized knowledge, but also leadership, organizational capabilities, presentation skills, etc, which is the main reason I participated in the team. My assignment in the team is the human practice, which means that I should promote our team and the iGEM to the public, letting more people comprehend what we, the iGEMers, are working on. Age is just a number. Members of our team all try their best in areas of our own specialties in order to reach the summit of the team, wishing to have a successful experiment as well as a best performance in the competition.

Hello, my name is Stephen Lin. I like playing sports, reading novels, and of course, synthetic biology. It's been a great honour to be in an iGem team. I think what iGem brings me is that I get to know both how synthetic biology works and how we solve tasks at the same time. As an iGemer, I fully recommend people all around the world to participate the activity.

Hey, this is Ryan Chiu from Mingdao High School. I have a lot of hobbies like playing basketball, reading novels, listening to music, and, sometimes, draw pictures. These are the things I enjoy doing in my spare time.  The reason why I joined iGEM is that I like to do scientific experiments especially those about biology, and it was not until I joined iGEM did I realize how beautiful and profound this world is, which made me deeply in love. What I do in this team is to work on the posters and other art works. Our logo was made by me, as well. Oh! And I also act as the mascot of our team at the Jamboree, so...can't wait to see you guys in Boston~

LIN,HSUAN-YI (Teddy)
Team Leader, Experiment
Hi guys. My name is Teddy. I’m a student from Mingdao high school and also a member in the Mingdao iGEM team of 2016. I consider myself an energetic person, who’s always full of energy and willing to do or try the things I’m interested in. Just take English pop songs for instance. Devoting a lot of time to listening to pop songs, my friends regard me as a big mad fan of those songs. Except for music, I’m also really into almost all kinds of sports, including basketball, soccer and swimming. I enjoy the feeling of playing sports and it also helps me relieve my stress.
Being good at science and math (and also interested in, of course), I decided to join in the iGEM team in Mingdao. I think it’s one of the places where I can bring my abilities to bear and show my talents. Also, in my opinion, it’s one of the methods to change the world, even just a little. In addition, I can share my ideas and meet people who have a lot of good ideas. That’s what aroused my passion toward iGEM and also the reason why I’m typing this now. I’m really looking forward to meeting you guys soon.Bye.

Experiment
I am currently studying at Mingdao High School. I like reading. In fact, reading is actually most of my life. Besides popular novels, I like to read books about the economic theories, Chinese medicine and Chinese history.
I joined the iGEM because I want to learn the technology in the field of molecular biology with great details. After joining iGEM, I found that the things I read from the text books are so shallow.
I believe that iGEM is a competition that requires many people’s effort to create new things that can improve our quality of life. This way, changing the world would not just be a slogan.

All this work would not have been possible without the help of all teams in Chile (Universidad Mayor), who have guided and taught our current knowledge. Without their knowledge we would not had been able to  work in laboratory. We want also thankful to Universidad Mayor because without their labs and material labs this never could be possible. Also we want to thank our friend and school partner Javiera Mosqueda, who helped us to translate this wiki and support us anytime."

Hello! we are the team Saint Rose B 2016, our team is made up of seven students of the high school “Saint Rose School”, of Santiago Centro, Chile. We are all partner and we are very proud to be part of this Team.
Members:
Valentina Ceballos Urrutia
Hello everybody! My name is Valentina and I’m 15 years old. I want to study biotechnology because I love the science, especially molecular biology, I love doing plasmid extraction but I hate doing electrophoresis, it’s so bored.
Natalia Montellano Hernández
Hi! I’m Nati I’d like you to know me better, in science area I love working in the lab, it’s so funny, what I like the most is purified plasmid extraction, I always do that with my friend Valentina Ceballos (read up). Another thing you can know about me is that I was born in USA, well that’s not entirely true, but I would that. what is certain is that I love Disney, and if you are going to IGEM 2016 and see a girl with Minnie ears, it’s me!. So see you there!
Macarena Ramos Briones
Hi, It’s Maca here, I’m in second senior grade and this is my first iGEM experience, I love my team and I really enjoy the work during our project, especially when we work with fire, because is nice and warm, besides we must not work with latex glove, I hate them, never fits me well, other thing that you can know about me is that I love see movies and series, so if you know about a good movie or serie, let me know about it. Good luck, see you on 30th October.
Maximiliano Rojas Álvarez
Hello! my name is Max, I’m in second senior grade and I joined the group because I like the science. I think it’s a great experience work in the lab with my partners. I learnt a lot of things about biotechnology and is something great especially when we do electrophoresis , I love it.

Hi everybody, I’m Karen!. I’m the leader of the group. I’m a dreamer, curious, creative and focused at the same time. I love art and science. It’s my first year in the IGEM experience. I took this opportunity because it mixes the two things that I love the most(art and science). I love working in the lab and discover everyday somethings more because of that. I love my group and faith that we will captivate you, yes,you, the one who is reading this, jahajajah! See you in IGEM superheros!.
Tutores:
Javier Villacreses
He’s a biotechnologist and our teacher, but if we’re honest he’s more than a teacher for us. He is like a our nerd friend, and we say “nerd” because he is  surprisingly intelligent and his jokes are too bad, but we love him. Javier has helped us a lot, he taught us all the process and explains more than once time if necessary and we are thankful for that. The best thing is that HE IS GOING TO TRAVEL WITH US!. We are so happy, not only because we know that he can help us there but that we know we are going to have a very good time if he’s there, if you want to know more of Javier you can meet him in IGEM 2016, so see you there.
Ismael Espinoza:
He is the coordinator of the academy in Universidad Mayor. In some way all this trip it could be not possible if him wouldn't be responsible for all the traveling´s things. He told us about the IGEM and his experience there, also he give us some advices for our hotels and the clothes we should carry. He is a lovely person and he always supports us.
Cristian Ramirez:
He’s our physics teacher, if we’re  honest we were not so close to him, but with time we have learned to know him better, while it’s true that physics is not similar to biotechnology our teacher always tries to help us, and he goes to the classes with us, you never know when you need some about biotechnology, that what we thought, he is going to travel too, so if you have any questions about physics he can answer them, so write your questions and see him there."

Cancer thrives by preventing the immune system from targeting tumor cells. While current immunotherapies use dendritic cells to activate T-cells towards specific tumor antigens, they remain expensive and of variable efficiency against tumor immunosuppressive environment. To develop personalized therapies, our team focused on engineering yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae for targeted immunotherapy. First, we developed a software to select the best tumor antigen from patient sequencing data. Second, we created a yeast chassis to prime the immune system with the targeted antigen. This chassis was tested in vitro on mouse splenocytes and in vivo on mice presenting melanoma with significant results. Three complementary strategies were combined to induce the immune system. First, in order to modulate the tumor environment, yeast secreting the specific immune modulator IFNgamma was encapsulated into alginate beads to be injected in tumors. Secondly, to break the immune tolerance against cancer cells, T4 and T8 lymphocytes were elicited by a yeast antigen display system that can be adapted to any tumor antigen for personalized therapy. Last, to deliver cytotoxic compounds solely in the tumor environment, a yeast hypoxia bio-sensor was designed. Our standardized and customizable chassis takes advantage of these approaches to make personalized medicine a reality, with a scalable cancer therapy.

The sponge can filtrate up to 20m3 of water/day/kg making it one of the most powerful filtrating system alive. Pseudovibrio denitrificans has been shown to be part of several sponges microbiome. Our project is based on the engineering of this bacterium in order to develop a filtrating system allowing to sense and even degrade pollutants in water when cooperating with sponges.
2013
Our project focuses on developing a novel treatment for hematological disorders caused by an iron overload, such as hemochromatosis and thalassemia. These autosomal recessive disorders have symptoms including cirrhosis, arthritis, and heart failure, which result from overabsorption of iron from the duodenum. Although these are among the most common heritable diseases, treatment options are limited. Even today patients are mostly treated by frequent bloodletting, which many people cannot support. The aim of our project is to combat these diseases at the source by developing a therapy that prevents the intestinal absorption of iron. We engineer the Escherichia coli Ferric Uptake Regulation (FUR) system using a genetic inverter so that they produce siderophores (iron chelators) in response of high concentrations of iron. These engineered bacteria are delivered to the patient's intestine by encapsulating them in an ingestible polymer (capsule) that specifically degrades in the duodenum. Once released into the intestine, the bacteria respond to ambient iron by secreting elevated levels of siderophores, thereby chelating the iron to prevent its absorption by the patient.
2012
For our first participation in iGEM, we have decided to introduce a new organism to the competition: Xenopus tropicalis. Its common name is the Western clawed frog, a diploid cousin of the model organism Xenopus laevis. Aside for the soft spot French have for frogs, we also believe Xenopus could be a great multicellular chassis for synthetic biology. We are therefore bringing this organism to iGEM for the first time, along with the tools we need to bring Synthetic biology to the multicellular era. The laboratory part of our work can be divided into two categories: the creation of synthetic biology tools for Xenopus and the creation of a synthetic hormonal system. We created a multi-level model of this inter-tissue communication system, concurrently laying the groundwork for modeling of synthetic genetic systems in multicellular organisms. Finally, using vertebrates in synthetic biology poses deep ethical problems, which come alongside those of animal experimentation. iGEM aims to be cool and fun, but can we or should we keep the same attitude when working with vertebrate embryos ? Should we reduce animals to objects or tools by using words such as chassis when working with these multicellular organisms? Our resident philosopher lead our team’s reflection on these issues, proposing a guide for future synthetic biologists who wish to work with Xenopus.

The Evry iGEM Team 2016 was created by students enrolled in the M2 Systems and Synthetic Biology (mSSB) , during the very first months of lessons. By getting motivation and advices from ex-iGEMers, the team quickly started doing weekly Journal Clubs - to speak about science and share synthetic biology knowledge. Later, it expanded to third-year students in Life Sciences and Bioinformatics, and a student in Law. On January, the Brainstorming session started, organized solely by the students. In late March, and after several project discussions, the ""Let's PLAy"" idea was presented to researchers on the Institute of Systems & Synthetic Biology (iSSB) in Evry, and was finally chosen. From that point on, we kept designing the project and the real wet-lab work started at the beginning of July.
Ideas development, lab work, modeling and human practices have all been conceived and done by the team members, with the help of two advisors.
Project task distribution

Social networks were coordinated by Toky, Yanis and Cécile.
Initial project idea was given by Alba. Further developments were done by all members of the team.
External help
During the development of the project, there were several people external to the team who gave advice or helped as indicated:
During the brainstorming, other students were part of the team. Along the project design, Mauro Moreno (M2 mSSB), Manu Gimenez (M2 mSSB), Rebecca Sciauvaud (L3 Life Sciences) and Sarah Piet (L3 Life Sciences) contributed with their ideas. Zaahith Abdoulatif (L3 Life Sciences) defended our project in front of the subvention CROUS commission.
In the procedure of choosing adequate plasmids for P. putida, we had the advice of Victor de Lorenzo (PI, CNB-CSIC).
For the collaboration with Bettencourt and MS and HPLC experiment, we counted with the supervision and help of Ioana Popescu (Associate professor, UEVE). Abolis biotech also contributed on supervision of MS experiment.
For modeling the Dynamic regulation with Kappa, we had the collaboration of Adrien Blasso-Blandin (Postdoc, ENS Lyon - HMS).
For filling the wiki, we received advice from François Bucchini (Research assistant, iSSB).
For press communication, we were helped by Dominique Zeliszewski (CR1, CNRS).
To initiate the team, we had the advice of Tristan Cerisy (PhD student, CEA).
For engagement, we were facilitated to do presentations to high school students by Laurent Martorell and Céline Barreto, teachers of Langevin-Wallon high school.
For human practices, we had several helpers, referred in the Integrated Practices page . On the survey, collaborators were: Marie Beigelman,Nicolas Mandroux and Amélie Touzeau Duquesne. For the MOOC, we went to record at the Maison des Initiatives étudiantes. We were helped by Professor Souleymane Bachir Diagne, JerryClan Sénégal and a former student in Senegal. For banning plastics report, information was provided from BioFutura, Olivier Kerfant from Artaxerkes Sarl and Ms Sandra Guillomot, Head of Cabinet of Célia Blauel, deputy Mayor for sustainable development at Paris City council.
Host institutions
iSSB: All the experiment performance was possible thanks to the space given in iSSB and Absynth lab, managed by François Képès (iSSB director) and Joan Hérisson. We received instructions for lab safety and security from Dominique Zeliszewski (CR1, CNRS) and Noemie Brisemeur (iSSB). All the iSSB researchers were prone to help: PhD students, research internals, employees and professors. Several of them were ex-iGEMers who helpfully shared their experiences with our team. None of the research lines of iSSB were dedicated to polymer bioproduction.
Génopole: The major part of financial support came from Génopole biocluster, with the approval of Emmanuel Dequier.
Université d'Évry-Val-d'Essonne: We were allowed to use facilities of the university campus, directed by Patrick Curmi, and its related associations coordinated by Sylvain Fisson.
Finally, we would like to thank our team supervisors, Andrew Tolonen and Bruno Colombo; our cheering committee, leaded by comandante Shawez; the Ulule contributors; our classmates and our families, for all the support they provided during these months.

Our team of students
Maria Bargués i Ribera
24 years old M2 mSSB
Coming from Barcelona, I finished this year the Master in Systems and Synthetic Biology (mSSB) in Évry. I started on the lab bench during my degree in Human Biology, but now computers have become my hands for doing science. In my near future, I plan to become a theoretical biologist working on dynamics of populations. Hobbies? Music as the key piece of the puzzle.
I barely knew about iGEM before coming to Évry, but motivation of ex-participants was contagious. Constructing an own project on Synthetic biology in an interdisciplinary context sounds too appealing for refusing the opportunity.  In the team, I have taken care of the modeling part and helped on the wet-lab, but my main role has been coordinating tasks and solving flux bottlenecks in team communication.
LinkedIn
Jean Debédat
24 years old M2 mSSB
Born and raised in Bordeaux, I moved to Paris when I joined the mSSB, as I’ve always been interested in new technologies and new approaches regarding Sciences. In parallel, I was finishing my industrial pharmacy curriculum.
I decided to join iGEM very early last year, as it seemed really fun and a great opportunity to come together as students to carry out till the end an interdisciplinary project. As part of the team, I was mainly in charge of taking care of the Wiki and most of the infographics.
After the Jamboree, I’ll head right back to the lab in Paris, as I am now doing a PhD on the implications of the human gut microbiota in cardiometabolic diseases!
LinkedIn
Delphine Dessaux
25 years old M2 mSSB
During iGEM, I was carrying out a master in Synthetic and Systems Biology in Evry, but I had a background mainly in biochemistry, more precisely in the proteins study. I learnt about iGEM during my Bachelor degree and I have always wanted to participate since then, but I couldn’t make it before this year.
My motivations? I wanted to discover lots of new interesting things in biology (wet lab as well as computer science) and share a great adventure with students from various fields. My hobbies? I enjoy reading novels and watching movies. A fun fact about me? I have no sense of direction, to the point that I lost my way in the lab several times during the first month of experiments.
My ideal synthetic biology project would have an environmental angle with, for example, bioremediation or pollutant detection involved. After the Jamboree, I will start a  PhD about DNA transport through nanopores.
LinkedIn
Vincent Gureghian
25 years oldL3 Life Sciences
Hey, I am Vincent and I just did a bachelor in Life sciences. I like to hike, to dive and to dance salsa, and I also love old hip-hop songs and funk music! Otherwise, I am making science animations for children! Fun fact: I have worked in an ice bar where even bacteria could not ^^
I truly believe in the synthetic biology idea of what you cannot construct/explain, you cannot understand! In the team, I am doing what nobody wants to do, or what I feel needed to be done... Mostly wetlab and side tasks! The best synthetic biology project is ours, for sure!
I only want my career to be interesting and I think orthogonal biology is an awesome topic!
LinkedIn
Jordan Hartunians
24 years old M2 mSSB
As everyone around (meeeeeh, except Taman, maybe), Science brought me here. I surely loved the concept of iGEM, of making some good and efficient fun from interesting ideas, and eventually spreading the whole story all around. And as the French philosopher Auguste Comte (almost) said, you can’t entirely know the science when you don’t know the story. So there, was the why.
The how, now. After a technical degree in industrial biology, a BSc in population biology and a MSc in microbiology, I signed to join the thrilling army of mSSBers, discovering, let’s say, the motivating, cosmopolitan, environment of Evry and the associated bunch of brilliant new friends.  As for my role in the team, I was mainly present at the beginning of the project to coordinate the mess, to launch the administrative part, and to trigger brainstorming sessions at the pub. Then most of my tasks consisted in investigating on how Maria felt on late Friday nights. I also, c’est vrai, enjoyed the organization of The European Experience, and I took part in our search for sponsors.
On a more personal point of view, talking about passions: I have been working in science mediation for more than three years now. Because, you know, you can’t entirely know the science when blablabla… And now I will be back to Brest and to my first love (the ocean), to try to get myself a PhD by applying metabolic engineering to a marine extremophilic microbe.

Taman Mhoumadi
21 years oldM1 Health Law
Hi, I am Taman ! I made an Erasmus before entering my Master and I wanted to taste international vibes once again. I am curious about everything so when I heard “international project” and “whatever your field of study, you can come”, I joined straight away.
I like to understand scientific concepts but I am more interested on how it interacts with society. And as synthetic biology is new to me, I have learnt a lot!
My role in the team is to develop the Human practices section and to coordinate the European Experience event.
LinkedIn
Charlotte Nayrac
22 years oldL3 Life Sciences
I am a student in 3rd year of License in Biology, option chemistry and physic. The reason I joined iGEM was to learn how to manage a project in its entirety. I gave the maximum of myself for our project, I participated in administrative tasks and laboratory experiments.
Creative, I helped to carry out the design of the poster, logo and t-shirt.
In my free time, I enjoy doing sport and eating delicious dinner with my friends.
LinkedIn
Amir Pandi
24 years old M2 mSSB
With a bachelor's degree in Cell and Molecular Biology from the University of Tehran, followed by a master in Systems and Synthetic Biology at the University of Paris-Saclay, I am starting my PhD on building genetic-metabolic circuits enabling complex computation using engineered bacteria.
During the Master I joined iGEM mostly leading the Modeling team on parts design, metabolic network optimization and designing the dynamic regulation circuit. Then joining to the wet lab, I built BioBricks of the team in one shot because I am super lucky!
Science and technology is my hobby! and love to think of how to develop sophisticated biological circuits doing applicable computations.
Robert Ramírez García
26 years old M2 mSSB
When I was born, my parents decided to call me Robert. After that, I tried to survive until today. I don't even know why I ended up being stuck with a group of French-Spanish-Iranian-Malagasy people that were doing a project in synthetic biology and I decided to give them a lift by looking for sponsors, project design, playing in the lab and presenting the project to the public.
I brought chaos and revolution to the team to wake up their most brilliant ideas. I am the bioreactor engineer, a gifted negotiator, and I know quite a lot of very romantic sentences in french.
LinkedIn
Toky Ratovomanana
20 years oldL3 Bioinformatics
Hello, my name is Toky. Coming from Madagascar, I did my bachelor degree in bioinformatics at the University of Evry. Passionate about technology, biohacking and neuro linguistic programming, I heard about iGEM and I knew that I wanted to participate.
As a computer geek, I was involved in most of task requiring a computer. Designing primer, analysing sequences, modeling and building things virtually before assembled them in the lab was main part of my tasks. Curious, I like to know what happen in the different part of the project and I love to bring my touch and help making things advance.
LinkedIn
Jonathan Tellechea
23 years old M2 mSSB
My name is Jonathan. I was born in Uruguay and I studied Biotechnology in Spain. During this year I have been coursing a Master in Systems and Synthetic Biology in Evry. I am quite shy but I try to give my opinion always I can help. I decided to participate in iGEM because I truly think SynBio is the answer for many mankind problems and I love doing science! I have mainly worked on the bench but I have tried to help drylab team as much as I could.
Mounia Saaidy
24 years oldL3 Life Sciences
I am Mounia, and I am very interested by the interface between biology and chemistry. It is an important aspect in the Master’s degree in pharmacology I want to pursue.
On the other side of my personality coin, I really enjoy going out and do sport. I love to go to the cinema, I have been practicing Crossfit for more than 2 years.
I have been given the chance to participate in the iGEM competition. I worked mainly in “wetlab”, I was involved in communication and sponsoring and I was helping in the design part (the wiki, the Tshirt,etc). For undergraduates (like me), it is an opportunity to get more experience in the setting up of a scientific project and in labwork.
I really enjoyed the team spirit and the funny moments spent with the other members of the team! Humanly it was a good experience of sharing and collaboration.
Our Advisors and PIs
Cécile Jacry
25 years old Instructor & Advisor
I am a research engineer in Dr. Faulon's Lab and the advisor of the Evry iGEM team 2016. The iGEM competition is for me a good opportunity to share my knowledge and my experience about this competition, as I did iGEM in 2014.
My main task is to take care about the administration part of the project and to be present when my team needs me for an advise or the wetlab.
I hope that in my future, after the PhD, I will become a great researcher and to be accepted in the Wyss Institute. It's my dream
Otherwise, I like to cook cupcakes!!! My funny fact is that when I have a lot of things to do at the same time and my brain freezes, like I don't remember me what I should do, I tap myself on the head to restart my system ^^.
LinkedIn
Alba Iglesias
23 years old Advisor
Hi! My name is Alba, I did mSSB this year and I will start my PhD in Synthetic Biology very soon. I did iGEM twice as student and it was the best experience I've ever had.
I love photography, reading and writing about science and watching movies. In conclusion, I'm still waiting for my Hogwarts letter.

Our team, including the PIs, are all volunteers and community members of Denver Biolabs.     All of the work presented at the Jamboree, on our wiki, and the work done in our lab was a     collaborative effort by all of our members. A special thanks to one of our team members,     Kerry Vasboe-Peach, for taking our team photos and many of the photos on our wiki.
The fluorimeter and optical density sensor we built was based on a design by the 2014 Aachen iGEM team .
We relied on the DIY receptor design instructions created by TU-Delft's 2012 iGEM team .
We were inspired by a previous oxytocin project by     the Lethbridge Canada 2013 iGEM team .     We received their submitted oxytocin-neurophysin part from iGEM HQ and are working on     improving and refining it.
We want to thank the University of Colorado Boulder and Colorado State University 2016     iGEM teams for helping us with our Jamboree presentation, providing us with a solid protocol     for CaCl2 competent cells, and sending us some DNA samples to experiment with producing     our own enzymes.
We also want to thank the Phiel Lab at the University of Colorado Denver for     supporting us with some consumables, the use of their nanodrop, and allowing us to     use their fluorimeter to calibrate our DIY version.
Finally, we owe a huge thanks to the generosity of our sponsors: IDT, New England Biolabs,     SnapGene, Dharmacon part of GE Healthcare, The ODIN, and Inworks. A special thanks goes to Inworks     in particular for housing the Denver Biolabs lab, providing the mentorship of     its staff and faculty, and use of their prototyping equipment to build our hardware. Thank you!

Adviser
Xiaopeng Gao
Hi, I am Xiaopeng Gao from Beijing Institute of Technology. As an advisor                                                 of BIT-China, I have given a lot of proposals to our program which is just                                                 like our baby. What’s more, I have devoted myself to this                                                 program and pinned great hope on it.
My major is biochemical engineering and the field of my research is                                                 metabolic engineering and synthetic biology,                                                 so iGEM is a rare chance for me to use my major strength to solve practical problems.
After year-long preparation, I have been head over                                                 heels in love with our program and harvested a lot. I really appreciate iGEM.

My name is Beijia Han, I’m a master student in School of Life Science,                                                 Beijing Institute of Technology. My major is Biology and my research is                                                 focus on enzyme modification. Luckily, I join in the 2016 iGEM competition as                                                 an adviser in BIT-China, and there is a four-year history of our                                                 team (BIT-China) representing our school to attend this prestigious                                                 competition to show our research projects. This year our team project                                                 is mainly about population quality control. As an adviser, my mission                                                 is to help the undergraduate students to solve the problems in this                                                 research and give proper suggestions. It is a challenging task,                                                 but I love this feeling that we fight together.

Hi. It's my first year to be an iGEMer. I am so honor to join this team and gain a lot of precious experience in this project. To be honest, this is the most amazing summer that I ever have.
I am that kind of people who adore drawing and handcraft, because it can make me like an awesome person. If you also a big fan of drawing and handcraft, we can talk more about it.
Let us enjoin this giant jamboree.
Hui Luo
Hi~ I’m Hui Luo. This is my second year to attend IGEM competition. A lot of challenges and funny things come together to my life. I’m fascinated about science and technology. IGEM gives me a great opportunity to touch my dream science and have a unique experience to intensively work on a project with my lovely teammates.
Actually, I’d love to become a well-rounded person, which means I can not only understand the scientific books but also know how to arrange my daily life. I’m not good at these kinds of things, but I’m trying to make efforts.
Lianjie Ma
Hi, dear. I’m Lianjie Ma. It’s my first year for iGEM. I do hope we can be good friends.
I belong to very typical slow person, but that won’t be the blocks between you and me. If you are interested in Korean teleplay or losing weight (smile bitterly), come to find me at BIT-China.
I can hardly wait to see you in Boston!
Kang Ma
Kang is named by my father, which in Chinese, means never give up and stay positive.
This is my first year to be an IGEMer. Changing the DNA of bacterial and making them work for us is the coolest thing I have ever done.
In my spare time, I play ping-pong and basketball, I like songs of Birdy and Ed sheeran. But now, more than anything, I want to go home and have dinner with my families.
Lirong Zhao
I major in chemical industry. Loving science, loving nature, loving biology, loving international technology, and loving iGEM, these features combine into me.
In our team, I am a new member and responsible for experiment and wiki, also learn a lot through the whole process.
People can only see the outward gorgeousness but the inward rough. Chasing dream is doomed to be a lonely journey, there will always be challenge and ridicule throughout the way. Even covered with wounds and cuts, we still should live beautiful for our own. Be chillax, and be graceful, remember we finally speak for ourselves.
Hongyu Yang
Major in biological. I feel honored to participate in the iGEM. I’m freshman for iGEM, I’m so happy to be an iGEMer. I love rising to the challenge, IGEM is a challenge for me.

Firstly, I so glad to get involved in the iGEM competition, this work gave me more deeply impression than itself, but in the communication with my team or the other team, which might have a big influence in my future. Besides, by this experience, I also made many new friends who were major on the different areas. They taught me a lot about my part, and I was so grateful of all the things.
Pengjing Hu
My grandmother has said: “You will change the world in the future, my dear grandson.” So today, I am here and join the iGEM 2016 in order to make my grandmother’s dream come true. Save the world and protect all the human beings!
My Chinese name is Hu Pengjing; also, you can call my English name Beaz. I come from China. I like biology and soccer. If you also have the same dream, I will be together with you!
Synthetic biology gives us a chance to create all kinds of fungus with different superpowers. I don’t have the superpowers but I can give it to bacteria. So I believe that my super bacteria will help the human being one day.
Pengcheng Zhang
Hello, everyone. I’m Pengcheng Zhang. It is my second year for IGEM. This year, as the leader of BIT-CHINA, I hope I can have a different experience. My major work are the wet and dry experiment.
IGEM is really a good chance to exercise ourselves, I do hope we could enjoy the special trip together. Also I want to do works more independently rather than just rely on team members like last year.
Jianfang Ren
Hello, everyone! I am Jianfang Ren, a junior student from Yan’an University and major in bioscience. I haven’t learned about iGEM at all. This is my first year for iGEM.

Hope be your friend in Boston.
Ziyin Zhang
Hey, buddies, look here, the story told by Ziyin Zhang is about begin, from the mysterious ancient oriental country, China. With biological engineering professional skills, I crossed thousands of miles to the iGEM in order to create new energy and protect the world. I carried what I have and what you want. What I wish to emphasize here is that my story has unique plots of ups and downs and the enthralling end. If we're lucky to meet each other, I think you'll like it.
Zeyan Li
你好, I am Zeyan Li, enchantée！Hablo chino, inglés, español y un poco de francés. Haha~ you can call me Hamster because friends said I am really a hamster when eating biscuits. Two years of involvement in BIT-China iGEM team makes me a “housekeeper”, not only developing the research project with experiments but also doing design work to show the public our team. In my free time, I enjoy seeking all kinds of new food experience, except drinks with sugar:( By the way, the protein my favorite is our Killer Group’s hokD!
Yiru Yang
I’m Yiru Yang. I’m an undergraduate student from Beijing Institute of Technology, and my major is biology engineering. In order to achieve some useful purposes, I think that designing and constructing biological machines with synthetic biology knowledge is really very important and amazing.

Overview
 
 
    We are very concerned about the public engagement in synthetic biology. We have to admit that transgene has been doubted since it came into being, and the idea of synthetic biology is heard much less, which make the public much easier to misunderstand it. Apparently, synthetic biology will not “save the world”, but it has a lot of potential to make it a better one. As iGEMers, we hope to contribute to expand the public understanding of synthetic biology, so that to save the potential from the public’s misunderstanding. From another aspect, burying ourselves in the lab is not a sensible idea, so we need the voices outside lab to help us to know what we have been engaged in better. So we organized some activities concerned public engagement to interact with people. To our satisfactory, we got positive feedbacks and were inspired in a way.
 
Team Members
Yang Ma
    I am doing wet experiments of iGEM student work, but I really really don't like doing that. The year of iGEM work has taught me how to love and how to communicate with different characters.
Lejian Jiang
Shisheng Li
    I'm a optic engineer major student from ZJU. I joined the iGEM competition because I think it's a great opportunity to work in a team and try different things. My role in the team is dry lab member, which means that I am in charge of everything about wiki and modeling. I enjoy novels and jogging while i'm free.
    I'm a second year bachelor student Life Science.Within the team, I'm responsible for light-dependent part of our experiment.During the past several months,I've gained a lot thanks to iGEM.It must be one of the best experience during my college life.
 
Xinyi Peng
    I'm a second year in Polymer Science and Engineering, and I constructed the light-controlled model and some sections of wiki for iGEM ZJU-China 2016. Arrested by the charming intersection of different subjects, I put my full heart into the competition and eventually gained a lot.Actually, I'm always optimistic to the life, and I believe that life contains sorrows that can never be assuaged, why not smile and keep stepping forward?
JR Lee
Feiyang Kang
    I am a third year student of Life science. I love the feeling of accomplishment after hard work, which might be the reason why I challenge myself to be an iGEMer. I am a human practice manger within the team, which means I am responsible for all the public engagement affairs. Sparking the public’s curiosity and hearing the voices outside the lab are really a special experience.

Jinshi Ran
    Hello, I am Jinshi Ran, a junior student who major in biotechnology. I have ever studied in a lab with immunology and translational medicine background. Modularizing and standardizing genes, and connecting them to construct an artificial biological systems are really attractive to me, since it calls into full play one's imagination and creativity. I love the idea of synthetic biology, and that’s the reason why I participate in iGEM. As a member who is responsible for wet experiment, I participate in the design of the project, and is in charge of the experiment of the oscillation system.
Zhanyu Wang
    Hello, iGEMers, I am Wang Zhanyu, a sophomore majoring in clinical medicine at ZheJiang University. In our project my main responsibility is lab work. I’m in charge of the logic gate and its characterization, and I take part in the design of microfluidic device, too. In the brainstorm, I have an idea called ""Bioelectrical Interface"", though it is dismissed at last, I still believe it to be a great project. When I participated in iGEM, I were just a freshman. During these eight months, I'm very glad to develop a deep friendship with other 11 people in ZJU-CHINA 2016 Team, and I have also learned a lot of knowledge about molecular biology. What ‘s more, I’ve been to many areas around China to meet people from all walks of life and introduce our project to them. In a word, I feel very honored to be a iGEMer.
Jingyu Zhao
    I’m Zhao Jingyu, a senior student major in Energy and Environment Systems Engineering. I feel lucky to be a member of ZJU-China. My encounter with iGEM will always be a romance in my memory. Although my major seems nothing to do with synthetic biology, I experience and learn a lot from my team members, and I really appreciate their amicability, endeavor and help.  My responsibility in the team is HP. At the beginning of our project, I have listed several aspects as our goals. And thanks to our whole team’s cooperation, we have participated and held several events. These events not only make our project more complete, but also let us know more about iGEM, synthetic biology and other teams related.  iGEM is more than a contest. It is an important journey. During this whole year, we learn cooperation, time management, communication, and the most important one, friendship, because we are a whole.
 
Hongya Zhu
    My name is Han Wan. I'm a third-year student majoring in Biology. I took part in experiments of the logic gate module, and also took on part of the art and design works. I really enjoyed this process. It was an unforgetable experience in my college life.
Han Wan
Zhiqiang Fu
    My name is Hongya Zhu. I'm a third-year student majoring in Applied Biology. I took part in experiments of the oscillation module. I've really learned a lot in this process and there has been lots of fun.
    My name is Zhiqiang Fu from ZJU-CHINA 2016, and I am majoring in mechatronic engineering. In our project this year, I am mainly responsible for designing our microfluidic device, building our biological models and editing our wiki.

Major: Plant Protection
I am a student leader of FAFU-CHINA team. After the last iGEM competition, I summarized the experience about how to build an integrated team, establish a reasonable project for such a short set-up time and so on. I am in charge of project, experiment, and human practice design. Meanwhile, I take charge about academic writing for content of wiki and poster. And I will give presentation at the Giant jamboree. Seeking cooperation during iGEM competition is also my task. Handing over my task to Hao Feng is a sensible choice for me because I would visit University of Alberta in Canada after summer. Attending iGEM firms my belief to purse scientific research as a life-long course.

Major: Bioscience
I am a member of Human Practice Group in my team FAFU-CHINA. What I mainly work for the team is writing, analyzing questionnaire, searching academic materials for handbook of mosquitoes prevention, compiling the handbook and so on. Since dengue fever, Zika virus, and malaria that transmitted by special mosquitoes have been epidemic in many areas and threatened human health dramatically, it is high time to let people around learn more about what kinds of mosquitoes are pathogenic and how to prevent from epidemic diseases. It is exactly our group's aim. It is grateful that iGEM gives us undergraduates a platform to display our enthusiasm on research and novel ideas.
 
Tong Tong

Hi! I'm Tong Tong, as you see, my first name and last name are spelled the same, so some of friends prefer to call me T Square. I'm a junior majoring in bioinformatics, and now an exchange student at UIUC. In this year's competition, I mainly focused on data analysis and academic writing. My recent research focuses on building gene regulatory network on Arabidopsis thaliana.
 
Yuepu Zhao
College of Plant Protection
Sophomore
Major: Plant Protection
In FAFU-CHINA, as a member of HP group and molecular clone group, I participated in the editing of mosquito handbook and did some experiments about transformation. The first time I heard about iGEM was on the welcome party when I just enrolled in my university. I was attracted to this synthetic biology competition after listening to the older students who shared their experience and feelings in iGEM. So I decided to join them although I am actually not good at biology. In this group, I learned plenty of biological knowledge and improved some basic research skills, such as searching scientific articles, self-learning and presentation. I appreciate it and wish FAFU-CHINA could do better in 2016.
 
Yiyuan Sang

I raise and do experiments on mosquitos in our team. In addition, l often write some academic material for our wiki and poster. iGEM is a giant organization in the world, it can encourage the growing of young adults and brings lots of useful tool or system about biology to human being.so l am glad to join in because it is a big challenge.
 
 
Hanfang Ni
College of Plant protection
Sophomore
Major : Plant Protection
It is the first time that I take part in this competition. At first I thought that the preparation program is a kind of easy thing, just including some experiments, some communication and another things. But when the program began, all those steps became harder then it seems to be.
Facing those challenges was not a very easy thing, and I even thought about giving up some times. Anger, depression, weariness…All the pressure leads to lack of sleeping and negative attitude. Then I told myself that I need to calm down.
Keeping calm to do the program better, I divided the large program into some small parts and gave those parts their own deadline. Just like organizing a story, the ways of beginning, transition, turning, climax and ending are all in need of thinking and preparing. To have the best organization, any error in logic is not allowed.
“Try the best to make it! ” I told myself. The difficulties in front of us are appearing to be solved. I still believe this method. Honestly speaking, this competition is not only a showing of ability but also a improvement of ability. And the most important thing that I learned from this competition is hard-working and self-confidence.   
 
Yi Cai
College of Agronomy
Sophomore
Major: Agronomy
I mainly focus on doing experiments on molecular cloning. I think the iGEM can build up my experimental skills and shape my knowledge hierarchy of science and synthetic biology. During the past few months, I have built deep friendships with my teammates and other participants of iGEM. I believe that I can open the door to a new world in the field of biology and meet excellent young people who are crazy about scientific research.
 
Liangdi Chen

Supervisors Students
Supervisors
Our team this year could not have achieved what we have without the help and support of the fantastic people around us. We would like to thank everybody for their patience and assistance with our project this year no matter how influential their contribution.
Supervisors:
Professor John Love: Associate Professor in Plant & Industrial Biotechnology and our lead iGEM coordinator. He provided us with some much needed advice throughout the project both within the lab and on many aspects of our Human Practices.
Dr Paul James: Research Fellow and our first point of call for anything iGEM related. From helping us in the initial planning of our project to aiding us with our module design, lab techniques and modelling, Dr James has been incredibly influential in all aspects of our project.
Dr Chloe Singleton: Research Fellow and main point of call within the lab. Dr Singleton was their to assist us on any and all lab techniques and protocols. She also provided further advice on various science outreach projects and other queries we had during the summer.
Jamie Gilman: PhD student and main supervisor for the first few weeks of the summer. We would like to thank Jamie for his patience with us in the lab and taking time out of his own research to help us understand and carry out the protocols as well as running the FACS for us in the Interlab study.
Ryan Edginton: PhD student and point of call for anything physics or modelling related. Ryan was particularly helpful for advice on biological modelling and with his experience of iGEM, he helped us with time management and wiki construction. Ryan was also instrumental in helping conduct the Newcastle collaboration and the intensity measurements of our apparatus.
Advisors:
Dagmara Kolak: Laboratory Manager. We would like to thank Dagmara for her guidance on good lab practice to ensure our experiments were designed and carried out in a safe way.
Dr Anya Nenniger: Research fellow. Anja was particularly helpful with primer design, guidance on genome integration and ensuring the lab work was done in an efficient manner.
Everyone else in the Mezzanine lab: Thank you very much for letting us take over your lab for the summer, we hope we didn’t cause you all too much stress!
We would also like to thank IDT for their support providing us with the free g-blocks of the parts we used in the lab work. Without the quick arrival of the DNA, we would have been unable to complete our lab work efficiently.
Human Practice Advisors:
Module-
There were various people who helped us and gave us advice on creating a synthetic biology module for second years. Thank you to Dr Mark Ramsdale, Dr Caitlin Kight and Dr Nicky King for advice in the initial planning stages of the module and further to Dr Paul James and Professor John Love for championing our module at later stages to ensure we have the best possible chance of getting it implemented. A special thanks to all the lecturers we met and frightened by proposing they become module coordinator for the module!
Board Game-
As the board game was the longest running project, there are many people we need to thank. First of all to Ms Hayley Andrews and those at The Judd School who allowed us to test the first prototype of our board game, and later for her advice about getting it distributed to schools across the UK. We also want to thank all those who helped us design and make the initial and later prototypes of the board game and to Damien Riddle of Edexcel, who gave us backing to create a Stretch and Challenge tool for students and teachers. Dr Mark Ramsdale deserves a big thank you as he provided us with the funds necessary to print off board games and cards for widening participation activities. Dr Alice Mills was essential, both in the early stages and the late in helping us find schools to test our board game in. Dr Caitlin Kight also provided some good advice on how best to distribute the board game and ways we could make it more accessible. On the same note, we would like to thank all those who came up with brilliant ideas on improving our board game design and implementation, like Dr Sara Burton. We are especially grateful of Colyton Grammar School for agreeing to have us for a less and testing the latest version of BioMech as well as Tyrone Middle School in Florida and Bishop Wand C of E sixth form.
Public Engagement-
We would like to thank all the people - academics, researchers and public figures - who were interviewed or recorded Desert Island Science podcasts with us; we wouldn’t have had a public engagement human practices without you. Dr Caitlin Kight, Ben May, Duncan Sandes, Grace Williams have all been influential at one point in improving our interaction with the public and students, especially Ben May in helping set up a separate web page for our project, specifically looking at the equality and diversity work. This allowed our message and work to be shared by the university and various social media accounts. Dr Sara Burton has also given us very useful advice on how to engage more with the public. We would like to thank Dr Nicky King for allowing us to attend the two science fairs. We would also like to thank the three work experience students who helped develop our project, both in Human Practices and in the Lab.
Equality and Diversity-
We are very grateful that Dr Andrew Griffiths, Dr Eduarda Santos, Dr Ceri Lewis, Dr Sharon Dixon, Dr Rob Wilson and Professor Michelle Ryan could take time for us to interview them on equality and diversity. Without these interviews and experiences shared, we wouldn’t have had most of our equality and diversity work and we wouldn’t have been able to develop our own views on equality and diversity. The Athena Swan Group and the Equality, Diversity and Inclusivity group at the university gave us the statistics necessary to back up the accounts given by the academics we interviewed. We would like to thank all those involved in helping us, especially those at XTV and Xpression FM for helping to host the equality and diversity in science panel discussion (Particularly James Woolcock and James Cunningham). Furthermore we would like to thank the panel: Dr Rob Wilson, Dr Alison Hill, Alec James and Laura Howard, for helping us inform the public on the issues of equality and diversity and provided well grounded opinion and understanding.
Integrated Human Practices: lab-
We are very grateful of the insight and feedback from Marcus Geshater, Dr Tom Ellis and Professor Richard Titball, allowing us to change and adapt our lab work according to its potential use in academic research or industry. We also wish to thank Prof. Robert Beardmore for his advice early on in the process about the prospect of kill switches being mutated against within a relatively short time-frame. Without his help, we would not have looked into using the ministat to create a continuous culture, testing the mutation rate of kill switches.
Students
Every student has had a big role in the project this year; all members of the team have made an appearance in the lab to help with the interlab or main lab project. Daniel Barber, Eloise Lloyd, Jack Fleet and Pablo Sharrock were most present in the lab, assisted by Emily Reeves and Joel Burton-Lowe were also commonly present in the lab this summer. In large part, the genome integration, cloning and characterisation analysis were performed by Dan Barber, Eloise Lloyd and Jack Fleet, as well as specifically the ministat was championed by Dan Barber.
Multiple members of the team were initially involved in research and facts finding for the modelling - Daniel Barber, Jack Fleet, Pablo Sharrock. However, the actual modelling work itself was mostly carried out by Joel Burton-Lowe, Andy Wild and help from Leanne Stanfield and Alan Williams.
We have collaborated with many teams and would like to thank them all for helping us, and we hope we helped them too. Alan Williams and Daniel Barber performed the Newcastle collaboration; Andy Wild performed the Edinburgh collaboration; Leanne Stanfield and Emily Reeves were most involved with the Purdue Collaboration; Alice Redgate and Pablo Sharrock performed the Stanford-Brown collaboration and despite the fact that we were unable to test with the Z1 strain from Glasgow, we would like to thank them very much for helping test the leakiness of our T7 promoter.
The wiki was designed and created by Alan Williams and Andy Wild, with help from Joel Burton-Lowe. Content for the wiki and wiki editing has been done by all members of the team, specific examples are: Daniel Barber writing much of the lab work and Jack Fleet writing and editing much of the Human Practices section, including all the equality and diversity content, with help from Emily Reeves and Andy Wild with the education sections. Joel Burton-Lowe has been the chief designer of the team - creating the posters, logo and other outreach materials.
In terms of public engagement and outreach Alice Redgate has been the most valuable member of the team: filming every vlog, every science fair/school visit, interviewing Professor Dawkins and recording and preparing all of the Desert Island Sciences. Various team members were responsible for communications with the academics, researchers and public figures for Desert Island Science, specifically Hannah Osborne, who arranged a meeting with Jim Al-Khalili. All members of the team have been involved in the scientific outreach at one stage, with Andy Wild, Eloise Lloyd, Joel Burton-Lowe, Alice Redgate and Pablo Sharrock having important roles in designing the board game. Presentations at the different schools were done by Jack Fleet, plus Jack Fleet and Eloise Lloyd prepared and performed the presentation at the Westminster meet-up. Leanne Stanfield was influential in the early stages of the module work, but this role was later taken up by Emily Reeves, who also presented the final product to the head of biosciences at the University of Exeter.
Jack Fleet and Alice Redgate are responsible for the equality and diversity work, interviewing academics and students about gender inequality and the activities of the university in this area. Jack Fleet hosted the panel discussion on diversity in science with a specific focus on gender inequality and Alice Redgate assisted with liaising with XTV and Xpression FM. Joel Burton-Lowe and Leanne Stanfield were very helpful in transcribing some of the interviews for recording on the wiki.
We would like to thank everyone that has helped us this year, we really could not have done it without you all!"

I am a third year PhD student, working in the Exeter Microbial Biofuels Group.          I am attempting to develop a set of thoroughly characterised, robust synthetic          promoters in a non-model organism using statistical models that link promoter           sequence and structure to function. This is my first year being involved with           iGEM, but I have enjoyed working with the team and am looking forward to being           a judge in Boston.

I am a Research Fellow in the Exeter Microbial Biofuels group under the direction of John Love. Within the group, my research uses a synthetic biology approach to develop a molecular toolkit that will allow us to engineer and control both synthetic and natural biological pathways within a non-model organism. Although this is my first year as an official member of the Exeter iGEM team, I have watched previous teams develop and test their ideas in our lab. Their enjoyment and enthusiasm for their projects has been an inspiration to all of us and I am proud to be an active adviser this year. Good luck Exeter iGEM 2016.

Hey there, I’m Ryan, a third year PhD candidate in Biomedical Physics studying under Dr. Francesca Palombo. I’m developing an understanding of the fundamental biomechanics and structure-function relationships that govern the physics and chemistry of the extracellular matrix. The iGEM experience persuaded me to crack on and do a PhD at the Physics-Biology interface; I was a student member of our very first iGEM team here at Exeter back in 2012, and am proud to have been an instructor to our guys ever since. I can’t wait to see what Exeter have in store for us this year! Exciting times!

The thermal conductivity of growth media.
Part of the Newcastle iGEM team's project this year involved an experiment centred around the creation of biological electronic components. Newcastle asked our team if we could help them out by finding the thermal conductivity of different growth media. With the help of our biophysicist supervisor Ryan Edgington , we came up with a plan to measure the conductivity.
To measure the thermal conductivity of our samples accurately using a temperature gradient, the effect of convection currents must be minimised. To do this we had to reduce the size of our samples (50mL falcon tube) and keep the temperature in a narrow range (roughly between 298K-303K).
To measure the temperature three thermocouples were used. The first one was attached to a 0.65m thin plastic coated copper wire (0.05m^2 in area) which ran through the flacon tube providing 5 amps to heat our sample providing the temperature gradient. The second thermocouple was attached to the inside of the falcon tube and the third was in the water to measure the external temperature.
Using this data a straight line of best fit was plotted using the least squares method. This was then used to calculate the average gradient of the graph. By using these value along with $$ \lambda = \frac{Q}{4\pi[T(t_{2})-T(t_{1})]}\ \log{\Big(\frac{t_{2}}{t_{1}}\Big)}$$ Where $Q$ is our power per unit length calculated by $Q = \frac{(I \times V)}{Length}$ , $T(t_\alpha)$ is the temperature at time $\alpha$ and $T(t_{2})-T(t_{1})$ is our gradient (Nagasaka and Nagashima, 1981).
As we used a plastic coated copper wire we had to apply a correction to the values to make them more accurate. This was done by calculating the conductivity of water using the insulated wire and comparing it to the given conductivities from here . We found that the conductivity value was roughly one fourth of the known value at any given temperature and the correction applied to the results of the lb and m9 media.Due to time constraints the lb experiment was repeated 6 times and 5 times for the m9 media with a water calibration being done each time and then the result averaged, errors were taken as the standard deviation of the measurements.Using the apparatus we had available we found the thermal conductivity of lb and M9 to be similar to that of water.The conductivity of water at room temperature is 598.4 $\frac{mW}{Km}\text{ }$(mili watt per metre kelvin). We found the conductivity to be (605 $\pm$ 20) $\frac{mW}{Km}\text{ }$ and (570 $\pm$ 30) $\frac{mW}{Km}\text{ }$ for LB and m9 respectively.
These values were fairly reliable to what we experienced during the test. The lb media took the same time to cool down to equilibrium as the water control test and thus the conductivities should be the same. The m9 sample took longer than water to cool down which correlated with the fact the conductivity was lower.

Attributions and Thanks From the RHIT 2016 iGEM Teams
The RHIT 2016 iGEM project is a continuation of the RHIT 2015 iGEM project.  We continued to use, build on, and verify the completed parts submitted to the database by last years team, as well as finish a few parts that were not completed but designed by members of last year's team, such as pSB416 GPD.  We are very thankful for the hard work last years team put into iGEM and glad to have had the opportunity to push their project forward and continue to engineer yeast mitochondria using synthetic biology.
Alexander Lacrampe and Xintong Xia worked on the mls-yeGFP for the duration of the project and  finished constructing pSB416 GPD with the help of Joe Lee as well as verifying its function.  Xintong and Xander also worked on testing mRPS12 TU in pSB416 and attempted to use it to restore mitochondrial function in mRPS12 TU knock out yeast
Holly Cox worked on and finished converting P413 GPD into pSB413 GPD.
Connor Holthouse, Justin Mader, and Joe Lee worked on the P416- CYC1 expression vectors and P426-GPD that did not get completed in the time period due to complications.  Justin managed both the team's collaboration with Purdue as well as our outreach a local high school and submitting the paperwork to start the Rose-Hulman Synthetic Biology Club.
Jake McClure and Holly Cox accomplished a majority of the work done on the team’s wiki page, with help from Connor Holthouse, Justin Mader.  Xander and Xintong wrote the project description, experiments, results, and basic parts pages.
All members of the iGEM received guidance and lab training from our PI, Dr. Anthony.  He also helped double check and order geneblocks from IDT and secured funding for the 2016 iGEM team.
We would like to acknowledge a few people for which the project would not be successful without. We would like thank Dr. Reizman for the help and use with the nanodrop, Shannon Tieken for the technical support with our equipment and providing us with the chemicals we needed when we didn’t have them. We would also like to thank Rose-Hulman for providing us with lab space, IDT for providing us with free DNA as well as our donor for the funding that we received. We would also like to thank Franklin Central for allowing us to come in and speak with their students about our project."

During one of the courses our team participated in during our second year of the bachelor, our current advisors introduced us to the iGEM competition. From this moment on they helped us with brainstorming about a suitable topic, advising us how to set up a research properly, and answering all our questions, sometimes with more questions. We are really grateful for all the time and faith they have put in our team! Please find a short profile for each of our advisors below .
prof.dr.ir. L. (Luc) Brunsveld
Prof. dr. ir. Luc Brunsveld is a professor at our university. During our bachelor, all our team members have attended his courses, mainly concerning chemical biology, like Biochemistry or Molecular Cell Biology. Now he also advises us during our iGEM project, which we are more than happy with! For a more extensive biography, click on the arrow:
Luc (Lucas) Brunsveld (1975) received his PhD degree in 2001 under supervision of prof. Bert Meijer at the Eindhoven University of Technology. Topic of the thesis was the self-assembly of designed molecules into helical architectures in water. Subsequently, he moved as a Humboldt fellow to the Max Planck Institute of Molecular Physiologie, Dortmund, to work on the protein semi-synthesis and evaluation of lipidated Ras GTPases in the group of prof. Herbert Waldmann. From 2003-2004 he worked as a group leader in the medicinal chemistry department of Organon (now Schering-Plough) in Oss, on nuclear receptor medicinal chemistry.
End of 2004 Luc Brunsveld received the Sofja Kovalevskaja Award from the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation, with which he established his own research group at the MPI of Molecular Physiologie, Dortmund, beginning 2005. He worked on the combination of supramolecular chemistry with protein biochemistry and cellular biology, generating new approaches to modulate biological processes. In 2006 he became group leader at the Chemical Genomics Centre of the Max Planck Society, Dortmund. Here he was working on the chemical biology of nuclear receptors to understand and modulate the nuclear receptor-cofactor interaction, in close collaboration with Bayer-Schering Pharma, Merck-Serono, and Schering-Plough.
In the middle of 2008 Luc Brunsveld received an ERC starting grant and became full professor in chemical biology in the Department of Biomedical Engineering at the Eindhoven University of Technology. In his research Luc Brunsveld uses chemical biology approaches to study protein-protein interactions. Two general themes are: 1) Supramolecular Architectures are being pursued as instruments to modulate protein-protein interactions and 2) the Nuclear Receptor – Cofactor interaction is being investigated as a specific protein-protein interaction with many unsolved questions, possibly amendable via chemical biology.
dr.ir. T.F.A. (Tom) de Greef
Dr. ir. Tom de Greef is an expert at modelling dynamic systems and synthetic circuits. He lectured two of our members in developing dynamic systems and their uses in synthetic biology. Tom is a big help when it comes to the computational and modelling part of our project, giving us feedback and helping us to find the information we need. This often results in enough reading material to fill your day. For a more extensive biography, click on the arrow:
Dr. Ir. Tom de Greef (1980) was born in Eindhoven, the Netherlands, and studied at the University of Eindhoven (TU/e), where he received his MSc degree in Biomedical Engineering cum laude in 2004. He completed his PhD at the Department of Chemistry at the same university in 2008 with professors E. W. Meijer and R. P. Sijbesma, working on novel polymeric materials based on quadruple hydrogen bonding motifs. Subsequently, he moved to the Biomodeling and Bioinformatics group headed by prof. P. A. J. Hilbers at the Department of Biomedical Engineering (TU/e), studying self-assembling systems from a computational perspective. He also became assistant professor at this department in 2010. In 2013, Tom de Greef was a visiting scholar in the group of Prof. D. Weitz (Harvard) working on protein affinity screening using droplet microfluidics.
Current research themes are centered on the engineering of artificial cellular systems (bottom-up synthetic biology) with the aim to rationalize physicochemical design principles of biological systems and to develop novel biotechnological applications. In this multidisciplinary work he combines his fascination for (bio)chemistry, mathematical modeling, microfluidics and complex systems. In 2012 and 2013 he was awarded a VENI and an ECHO-STIP grant respectively by the Netherlands Organization of Scientific Research (NWO). He is also core member of the Institute for Complex Molecular Systems (ICMS).
prof.dr. M. (Maarten) Merkx
Prof. dr. Maarten Merkx is a researcher at our university. Not only does he conduct an interesting research about protein sensors, he also takes the time to lecture students at our university, including our team members. This year he is giving our team critical advise on how to achieve the goals we strive for. For a more extensive biography, click the arrow:
Maarten Merkx (1970) studied Physical Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry at the Radboud University Nijmegen (cum laude). He did his PhD with Prof. Averill (University of Amsterdam) working on purple acid phosphatases, and subsequently was a Human Frontier of Science Program post-doctoral fellow with Prof. Lippard (MIT) studying methane monooxgenases. Currently he is professor in protein engineering at the Eindhoven University of Technology.
An important research theme is to develop generic engineering concepts for the development of protein-based switches, which include fluorescent sensors for intracellular imaging of metal ions, photo-switchable proteins, and protein-based sensors for antibody detection. He obtained young investigator grants from the HFSP and NWO (VIDI, 2006) and an ERC consolidator grant in 2011. In 2012 he received the award for the best TU/e teacher at the master level.

Team
Our team consists of 3 graduates and 8 undergraduates, as well as 1 instructor and 5 advisors. Our fields of study are microbiology, medical plant science, biotechnology, genetics, multimedia, electronic engineering, mechanical engineering and industrial engineering.
Vaughn Barendsen
BSc (Hons) Genetics
Currently doing my honours in genetics with a passion for the fields of human genetics and genetic engineering. I enjoy any physical activity that gets my heart pumping and the adrenalin flowing. I am also a huge Star wars fan, and could probably recite the entire Harry Potter series from memory if forced to do so. My motto: Remember to always be yourself! Unless you can be Batman then always be Batman!
Hobbies and interests: Science fiction novels, adventure sports, genetics, archery.
Thabang Msimango
BSc (Hons) Biotechnology
Biotechnology devotee! The prospect of doing pretty much anything you want to with DNA fascinates me. Plant Biotechnology honours. Well plants are awesome... sometimes. I am not lazy, NO! I just use my energy wisely. Laughter is my best medicine - that plus chocolate and coffee.
Hobbies and interests: Reading, watching tv and movies, playing games, braiding my hair.
Stephan Baggeröhr
BEng Mechanical Engineering
Prepare for stubble. My beard has double. To protect the world from damped vibration. To unite all people with ventilation. To denounce the evils of fatigue and failure. To extend the lives of assets under pressure. Bearings! Gears! Designing rockets at the speed of light. Simulate now before the flight. Aerodynamics! Thats right!
Hobbies and interests: Mathematics, thermodynamics, CrossFit, clarinet.
Simon Bezuidenhout
BEng Electronic Engineering
Final year Electronic Engineer designing elephant vocalization and tracking collars. Using electrons to dominate the world through automation. Envisages a smart home with Siri as my personal assistant, and a glass of wine awaiting me when I open the door. In every failure, a lesson was learned.
Hobbies and interests: Biomedical engineering, cycling, choir, animals.
Ricu Claassens
BSc Genetics
I am in the final year of studying towards a BSc degree in Genetics and Microbiology. I like to be “active” by playing (lazy) sports such as cricket and golf, but every now and then I would be more extreme and hike up a mountain. I am always interested by something scientific.
Hobbies and interests: Technology, science, sport, traveling.
Pieter Bredenkamp
BIS Multimedia
I am a final year Information Science student. When I’m not reading fiction or writing code, I can be found gardening, playing piano or cooking. I also get quite excited when people talk about computer games or espresso based drinks. Always on the lookout for a good pun.
Hobbies and interests: Game development, motion graphics, fine arts, reading, piano.
Nomakula Zim
BSc Microbiology and Genetics
If there was a career called “curiosity”, I’d definitely be a professional in it. A definite ambivert with a happy-place situated anywhere where there’s a good romantic fiction book and Rooibos tea. A die-hard rugby, tennis and anything-Marvel fan who absolutely adores stilettos.
Hobbies and interests: Reading, sport, astronomy.
Modjadji Makwela
BSc Microbiology
Microbes make up the most diverse life on earth and when looking really closely, a new world is revealed to you - more spectacular than you could ever have imagined. I’m intrigued by all organisms microscopic like fungi, viruses, bacteria and several other “germs’’. I am a final year microbiology student and when I’m not busy with all things in the microworld, I’m found spending time with friends and family.
Hobbies and interests: Reading, cooking, drawing, painting, family.
Maryn van der Laarse
BEng Industrial Engineering
Tracking elephants, drinking coffee. Hiking the mountains. Biking the African bushveld. Ecological industrial engineering the world’s problems. Creating GoPro videos of everything.
Hobbies and interests: Mountain biking, hiking, traveling, sport, reading non-fiction.
Brad Querl
BSc (Hons) Medicinal Plant Science
Doing my honours in Medicinal Plant Science, I seem to hear a lot of jokes about weed. Seems that it is the first thing on people’s mind oddly enough. I am passionate about plants - not too passionate about smoking them, but each to their own I guess. Long story short, I am a botanist that may enjoy lifting weights a little too much, and let’s not even get into the modelling story...
Hobbies and interests: Bodybuilding, fishing, skateboarding, reading, gardening.
Bernard Smit
BSc Microbiology
Ominous organisms, those that hide in plain sight but still have an unmissable affect, interests me. Especially those of who`s genetic code can be engineered to produce a profound and beneficial quality. I enjoy playing in our university`s orchestra and the engineering of robotics.
Hobbies and interests: Cycling, orchestra, Lego, science.

Just to give you a little background on what iGEM is all about: The International Genetically Engineered Machine (iGEM) competition is the premiere undergraduate Synthetic Biology competition. iGEM began in January of 2003 with a month-long course at MIT. This design course grew to a summer competition, which has evolved over the past ten years to include over 300 teams from all over the world. Student teams are given a kit of biological parts from the Registry of Standard Biological Parts at the beginning of summer. Working at their own schools over the summer, they design and build biological systems and operate them in living cells.
2006 marks the year that Purdue began its journey toward making a difference in the world of synthetic biology, entering the competition with seven undergraduate members and three advisors. Purdue continued to compete for the next four years, earning bronze medals almost every year but never anything more. Facing some trials and tribulations along this journey, Purdue did not field a team in the 2011 iGEM competition. Fortunately, the team was revived with enough interest and support to not only field a team in 2012 but to also receive a gold medal and advance to the international competition at MIT for the first time in the team’s history. Then in 2013 Purdue iGEM achieved an unprecedented success, ranking third in the undergraduate division of North America at the 2013 regional competition.
Now the Purdue Biomakers are back again, better than ever. With more members, increased funding, and a focus on upholding Purdue’s strong legacy in agriculture, conservation, engineering, and technology, you can expect the 2016 iGEM team to continue to redefine success, striving to reach even greater heights in this year’s iGEM competition!

Hana Kubo
President
Hana is a junior majoring in Genetics. She is so in love with DNA that she is convinced that she is going to marry it; she’s still waiting for the IDT proposal. Hana is the 2016 President of the Purdue Biomakers, but in reality she is just a figurehead and is actually held in captivity by Bo and the other executive board members. Hana is originally from Tokyo, but spent her elementary and middle school years in New York, and then high school years in Sydney, Australia. If this was the only thing you knew about Hana, you’d think she’s a pretty cool person. Hana hopes to become a research scientist and a university professor studying the genetics behind endometriosis, while working as a part-time K-Pop connoisseur. In her free time, Hana likes to dance in her seat while studying while listening to hard rock, as well as conduct excessively moderate online shopping. She often dreams of her cloning and transformations in her research lab working, or candles finally being permitted in residential halls. She then wakes up depressed because neither of those things will happen in real life.

Bowman Clark
Vice President of iGEM Team(VPiT)
Bowman is a junior majoring in Biology who is also pursuing minors in Biotech and Creative Writing. This year he aspires to victory at the 2016 Jamboree and has crafted a rigorous work schedule to accomplish this goal. He is excited to work on potentially groundbreaking research both in the characterization of proteins from Microlunatus phosphovorus and the integration of organic nanowires into E. coli. He loves to write all kinds of fiction (and some nonfiction) and plans to write a dystopian short story about phosphorous shortages for the SYNENERGENE grant application this year. When he is not engrossed in science or his writing, Bowman can be found making his guitar sing (when he can be bothered to practice), playing DOTA 2, or watching movies. Bowman styles himself a cinephile and scoffs at his interns for their poorly developed cinematic palette. He is devoted to improving both their synthetic biology skills and their taste in film. Bowman also enjoys hanging out with his friends and of course can’t wait to see Lexi every day.

Suraj Mohan
Treasurer
Suraj (sue-rudge) is a junior in Biological Engineering with a concentration in Cellular and Biomolecular Engineering. His love for synthetic biology first blossomed over in-depth conversations of gene therapy and viruses with his high school biology teacher. His legacy of being the “Virus Guy” still carries on with his high school friends to this day. He is also referred to as Sir-idge, Lieutenant Surge, and DJ Mohani: Mohani mo’ Problems. Suraj plans to pursue a M.S. in Biotechnology and work for an R&D department of a major biotechnology/pharmaceutical firm one day. His hobbies involve Netflix binges, obsessing over everything that is cooking, making good Arnold Schwarzenegger impersonations, and doing VERY on point Spongebob references in daily life. Someday, Suraj hopes to secure his dream career, live anywhere that is sunny (cough* California cough*), and own a pitbull named “Mr. Worldwide.""

Lexi Petrucciani
Director of Human Practices
Lexi is a junior in Biological Engineering with a focus in Cellular and Biomolecular systems and minors in Math and Dance. She loves synthetic biology and was ecstatic to have the opportunity to stay over the summer with iGEM in 2015. Now she is the Director of Human Practices and is just as excited. She plans to get a PhD in something... eventually... Other than that she spends way too much time dancing, like WAY TOO MUCH. She has danced in almost every style, but is currently into Hip hop (she cannot twerk), Modern, and Tap. She also enjoys watching shows by Joss Whedon, making obscure musical references, and looking at math proofs online (weirdo). She has no idea what she is doing with her life and is just trying to stop thinking about it and go with the flow as she learned in her Contact improv class.

Paige Rudin
Chief Liason
Paige is a current sophomore majoring in Biomedical Engineering with a minor in Global Engineering and concentrations in Neuroengineering and Pre-Veterinary studies. She thinks the brain is rad and would like to contribute to the growing body of research produced by brains learning about brains (it gets trippier the longer you think about it). As the 2016 Chief Liaison, Paige has earned the nickname “Tiny Rickus” by doing nothing other than resembling advisor Dr. Jenna Rickus. They both have curly hair—it must be the hair. A retired competitive soccer player due to 2 ACL reconstructions, Tiny Rickus has lived in the exotic locales of Illinois, Switzerland, Miami, and Indiana, once rode a dairy cow, and has a scar from an unfortunate incident with a pelican. In the time Paige decides to declare “free,” she enjoys reading, drinking coffee, petting cats, reading while drinking coffee and petting cats, drinking coffee while petting cats and reading, and petting cats while reading and drinking coffee. Someday, she hopes to cure ALS, or Lou Gehrig’s disease, while reading, drinking coffee, and petting cats.

Casey Martin
Casey is a senior in Agricultural Engineering with a focus on Environmental and Natural Resources Engineering (ie, she wants to be an environmental engineer while earning one of the longest-titled majors). This is her third year on iGEM. Currently hailing from Colorado (yes she knows what was recently made legal; no, you do not need to ask her about it or give a “knowing” look; yes, the mountains are very pretty you should visit), she has also lived in California (California girls come in beach tanned but also glow-in-the-dark pale with beautiful porcelain skin), Texas (stop making fun of it, it’s really not that bad y’all), and Georgia. She loves animals (see, above, environmental engineering), reading (see, above, engineering), swimming/scuba diving (see, in past and dive book, 10 years on swim team and multinational scuba dives), and eating fruit (see, in apartment, fridge half filled with watermelon, Fuij apples, Braeburn apples, red grapes, and bananas). She spends her time working, reading, practicing karate (it’s Key-Iy, not Hi-yah!), hanging out with her boyfriend, spending time in the cult-like environment of the iGEM team, and trying to complete all engineering homework and projects to a satisfactory degree (enjoying moderate success thus far). In the future, she plans to become an environmental engineer to fix environmental problems (possibly with techniques such as synthetic biology) and help the world get/stay clean “for [at least] ten minutes!” like Mr. Incredible.

Jill Osterhus
Jill is a junior in Biological Engineering, specifically Cellular and Biomolecular. She hopes to one day be in research at the forefront of synthetic biology and/or is considering becoming a professor. Future goals include saving the human race from inevitable self-destruction and finishing a shampoo and conditioner bottle at the same time. She enjoys making fun of reality television, reading in hammocks, and trying to not set smoke detectors off with her mad cooking skills. At Purdue, she is also passionate about Purdue Students Against Alzheimer’s (PSAA) and I2D2, a program teaching kids about engineering so that perhaps future generations can save us from being doomed for all eternity. And also because engineering is awesome.

Danish Ghazali
Mohammed will be a junior in biological engineering with a focus in cellular and biological engineering and a minor in management and certification in entrepreneurship. While he wants to one day be part of R&D in industry someday, for now he roams around in Dr. Philip Low's research mixing beakers and causing general mayhem. When not attending classes or in lab, Mohammed spends a majority of his time sleeping, playing basketball or tennis, or netflixing his life away. Oh and sometimes he and his roommate play music and bake M&M cookies. So yeah.

Archana Kikla
Archana is a sophomore majoring in Genetics and pursuing a minor in Biotechnology. She’s eager to learn about all aspects of the team and can’t wait to get in the lab. In her spare time, Archana loves to listen to indie bands ranging from the 60s to modern day, drinking coffee in hipster looking cafes, and spending quality time goofing off with her friends and family.
Back to Top
Barrett Davis
Barrett is currently a junior in Purdue's Weldon School of Biomedical Engineering looking to minor in computer science and perhaps pick up another language or two along the way. Although most of his friends couldn't name his hometown, neither could he, as his move to Purdue is only the latest in a long line worthy of its own Indiana Jones travel montage. If ever you were to catch Barrett when he is not hurriedly cycling from class-to-meeting, meeting-to-class, class-to-class, or meeting-to-meeting, you would probably see him playing his saxophone, learning guitar, mountain biking, listening to podcasts, or pondering about life around him (for instance why people do things ""on purpose"" rather than ""with purpose""). As a person made of stardust and recycled carbon, Barrett likes to believe in the non-zero chance that some of the atoms which now make up his knees and toes once resided in the rotator cuffs of scientific or humanitarian giants such as Alexander Fleming, Leonard Euler, and Mahatma Gandhi, but he tries not to actively let it go to his head. In the future Barrett hopes to work on improving medical infrastructure in the developing world, or (like Fleming) towards making leaps in the science of health and medicine in his respective century, be it through tissue, genetic, or pharmacological research (this time ""with purpose"", unlike Fleming).

Ethan Titus
Ethan Titus is junior in biological engineering with a focus on cellular and biomolecular engineering. He first found iGEM through a biotechnology class and has been hooked ever since. At the moment he hopes to one day work in research and development at a pharmaceutical or biotech company. In his free time he likes to read, play video games, and untangle those damn headphone cords for the third time today. He also enjoys solving Rubik’s Cubes and even made a club for them in high school. Ethan can solve one in under 30 seconds and is currently perfecting his technique for solving one behind his back and blindfolded while riding a unicycle and only interacting with the cube via telekinesis.

Our team made up of 17 middle school students from Nanjing Foreign Language School in Jiangsu, China. Though we may diverse in grades and classes, we are all fanatics about synthetic biology and its future application on environmental science.
We are a team of biology and chemistry lovers and a team of future researchers. We studied, discussed and worked together and are looking forward to show our projects on iGEM stages. Inside schools, we took elective classes in STEM subjects and attended Olympiad competitions together. As the only high school team in southeast China, we are determined to bring all our knowledge together and make our own “steps” in the realm of synthetic biology.

About USTC
University of Science and Technology of China, USTC
The University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) is a prominent university in China and enjoys an excellent reputation worldwide. It was established by the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) in 1958 in Beijing, as a strategic action by the Chinese government, to meet China’s science and technology needs and increases the country’s international competitiveness. CAS integrated its resources with USTC, with the aim of educating top talent in cutting-edge, interdisciplinary science and technology. The establishment of USTC was hailed as “a great event in the history of education and science of China”. In 1970, USTC moved to its current location in Hefei, the capital of Anhui Province.
From the start, USTC’s mission has been to “focus on frontier areas of science and technology and educate top leaders in science and technology for China and the world”. Central to its strategy has been the combination of education and research, as well as the emphasis on quality rather than quantity. Led by the most renowned Chinese scientists of the time, USTC set up a series of programs creatively encompassing frontier research and development of new technology. As a result, the university has taken the lead in higher education in China.
USTC is a world leader in fields like quantum manipulation, nanotechnology, high-temperature superconductivity, speech processing, fire science and life science. It is always ranked as one of the best universities in China. For example, USTC was ranked first among Chinese universities from 2008 to 2013 by Nature Publishing Index China. In addition, USTC attaches great importance to technology transfer and has incubated dozens of high-tech enterprises. Furthermore, it jointly built the Institute of Advanced Technology (IAT) with Hefei City in 2012, aiming to better promote the combination of education, research and industry. USTC-IAT focuses on fostering technological innovation and technology transfer in the IT industry, as well as microelectronics, health care, new energy, new materials and quantum information, etc.
USTC is regarded in China as the “Cradle of Scientific Elites”. Its educational principle emphasizes fundamental theories and provides students with a wide range of high-level training that incorporates newly emerging as well as interdisciplinary fields of study. The faculty-to-student ratio is one of the best among Chinese universities. Admission to USTC is extremely selective. Only the top 0.3-0.5 percent of high school graduates are admitted. Over 70 percent of undergraduate students are involved in the Research Program for Undergraduate Students in CAS research institutes or national labs on campus. USTC has the highest percentage of alumni, among Chinese universities, elected as members of CAS and the Chinese Academy of Engineering. Doctoral dissertations at USTC are frequently awarded the Hundred Annual Outstanding Dissertations Prize, which honors the top dissertations from Chinese universities.
USTC actively participates in international cooperation in various ways. It has engaged in joint research and educational activities with internationally acclaimed organizations such as the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER), the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN), the Max Planck Society, Oxford University, Heidelberg University, Stanford University, MIT, Princeton University, the University of California, Berkeley, and Yale University, etc. For example, it established a training program with ITER and initiated the SUM program, a summer camp for students and an academic forum for professors from Stanford University, USTC and MIT. USTC is also a member of several important international networks, including the Association of Pacific Rim Universities and the Association of East Asian Research Universities, etc. In 2013, USTC hosted the signing ceremony for the Hefei Statement, which USTC has actively promoted. The Hefei Statement is an agreement among the Association of American Universities (AAU), the C9 League (C9), a consortium of China’s top nine research universities, the Group of Eight (Go8), a coalition of Australia’s top universities, and the League of European Research Universities (LERU) to promote cooperation among world-class research universities.

School of Life Sciences, USTC
The School of Life Sciences was founded by Bei shizhang，a renowned scientist in Beijing in 1958 with emphasis on Biophysics at beginning and flourished to many branches of biological sciences in recent years. The new School of Life Sciences was established in Hefei, AnHui province in 1998 and the founding dean was Prof. Shi Yunyu, a member of Chinese Academy of Sciences. It consists of four departments: Molecular and Cell Biology, Neurobiology and Biophysics, Systems Biology and Biomedicine and Biotechnology. For scientific research, the School of Life Sciences has established a Center for Laboratory Techniques of Life Sciences and a division under National Laboratory for Physical Sciences at the Microscale. Moreover, there are two students practice bases which are located in Xishuangbanna, Yunnan province and Shengjing Lake, Anhui province.
At present, there are eighty-seven teachers in the School of Life Sciences, forty-two of them are professors (including two academicians of the Chinese Academy of Sciences) and fifteen of them are associate professors. All professors and associate professors are responsible for various aspects of teaching and research. They are providing various courses for undergraduates, graduates and PhD candidates. The teachers in the School Life Sciences are running many research projects, including general and key projects from National Science Foundation of China, key projects from the knowledge Innovation Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences, projects of the National Basic Research (973), projects of the National High Technology Research and Development Program of China (863), and the Major Program for the Fundamental Research of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. More than 70% of the professors are recruited from overseas in recent years. Twenty-two of them are honored as “One Hundred Talented People” of The Chinese Academy of Sciences, eight of them are honored as China National Funds for Distinguished Young Scientists, three of them are ChangJiang River scholar award scheme professors.
Presently, there are about 400 undergraduate students, 400 graduate students and 200 PhD candidates in our school. Because of the strong backgrounds in life sciences, our graduated students are playing more and more important roles in high education of scientific research both at homeland and abroad. Some of them have made prominent contributions to national sciences and were honored by various awards and medals from academic societies. Three doctoral dissertations were honored as the Awards for National 100 Excellent PHD Thesis. Four doctoral dissertations were honored as the Excellent PhD Thesis of the Chinese Academy of Sciences.

iGEM TU Delft
TU Delft iGEM team of 2016
Team Members
Our team consists of ten motivated students from Delft University of Technology, with interdisciplinary backgrounds. Hover on our faces to find out more about us or click on our names to go to our LinkedIn!
Liza de Wilde
MODELING MANAGER
I am a master student Nanobiology. This study program is both technical and biology orientated. Something I also find in the IGEM team. I think working together with people with diverse backgrounds in a team is a great opportunity that can extend my horizon.
Within the team I am the 'Modelling Manager'. This means that I am responsible for the modelling in the project to help the science department in the team. Furthermore I will play a role in the hardware development.
Outside the lab I enjoy cooking and making pies, dancing, and sailing.
Charlotte Koster
GRAPHICS, SAFETY AND HARDWARE MANAGER
Hi! I am a master student Life Science & Technology. During my studies I got fascinated by the concept of synthetic biology, so joining iGEM was an obvious choice for me! I am the multitasker of the team. First of all, I'm responsible for the safety, which is an important aspect, we don't want our laser bugs to escape! Furthermore I do all the graphics, so each logo, figure of picture you see is made by me! Lastly, I also take care of a part of the hardware, which is an exciting new field for me, there's a lot to learn! Furthermore, I'll do a lot of labwork and some modelling, a taste of everything!
Whenever I'm not building organisms or laser setups I enjoy playing field hockey at Scoop, making music, going to festivals and concerts and traveling. You can probably imagine that I can't wait to present our laser-shooting-lens-bacteria with our awesome team in Boston!
Lycka Kamoen
SCIENCE MANAGER
I am a master student Life Science & Technology. I enjoy learning new things, which is why I decided to join the iGEM competition. Whithin the team I am the science manager, meaning that I am in charge of the research related aspects of our project. I hope to learn a lot during this competition, including guiding our own research.
Outside the lab I enjoy singing, cooking and having a drink with friends.
Tessa Vergroesen
WIKI MANAGER
I am a Nanobiology bachelor student and a member of the Delft student rowing association Proteus-Eretes. I joined iGEM because I think it will teach me a lot about synthetic biology and teamwork at the same time. I am this years’ wiki manager, meaning that the layout, content and design of our website will be my responsibility.
When I’m not studying, rowing or working on iGEM, you can find me relaxing in the sun, possibly enjoying a book, movie or my iPod.
Giannis Papazoglou
TEAM LEADER
I am a Mechanical Engineering master student with track in Precision and Microsystems Engineering. I believe that the magic happens in multidisciplinary environments like the one we have in the iGEM team and when you leave your comfort zone to explore new ideas. That's why I decided to join a project so outside of my comfort zone and expertise.
In my free time I like to play and listen to music (if you need a drummer call me :) ), biking and traveling when I have the time.
María Vázquez Vitali
LAB MANAGER
I am a Life Science & Technology master student from Barcelona. I joined the iGEM competition because I think it's a great opportunity to work in a team doing something we all like. My role in the team is lab manager, which means that I am in charge of everything that happens in the lab, in strong collaboration with the science manager.
When I'm not working on iGEM I enjoy reading, going to the cinema and spending time with friends.
Carmen Berends
POLICY AND PRACTICE MANAGER
I am a master student Life Science & Technology. In this study disciplines of among other things chemistry, biology and physics are used to understand the cell and to create novel useful applications with these cell. This is also one of the most important goals of iGEM, which is why I decided to join the team.
Within the team I am the Policy & Practice manager. This means that I am responsible for all the social, ethical and legal aspects of our project. Furthermore, I am in charge of the business plan we are planning to make.
Outside the lab I am an international fencer and I am selected for the European championships in Poland in June. I also like cooking and to have fun with friends.
Iris de Vries
SAFETY TOOL MANAGER
I am an Aerospace engineering student. This obviously is an unconventional background for a member of the iGEM team, however, my interests lie more in the field of e.g. microbiology and not that much in the field of aerospace. Therefore, I am planning to (temporarily) leave engineering and continue my studies in Biomedicine next academic year.
The main reason I wanted to join the iGEM team is that I wanted to experience the actual work involved with synthetic biology and increase my knowledge. The focus of the iGEM competition on innovation and relevance appeals to me as well.
Lara van der Woude
FINANCE MANAGER
I am a master student in Life Science & Technology and Science Communication. During my studies I became interested in synthetic biology. Something I think is exciting is that iGEM enables our team to create a promising science project from scratch and decide all steps in this innovation trajectory. Another part of iGEM that attracted my attention was its aim to create more public awareness and opening a debate on synthetic biology.
Within the team, I am the Financial Manager and responsible for external collaborations. I have to collect money, enabling us to do our experiments and I keep track of all our expenses.
When I’m not doing iGEM or studying, I am rowing at the Delft student rowing association Proteus-Eretes, enjoying life and nature in the sun or sleeping!
Célina Reuvers
PUBLIC RELATIONS MANAGER
I’m Célina, a bachelor student Nanobiology. The idea to start a project from scratch is how iGEM attracted me. I also enjoy the challenge of bringing everything you learned into practice and experience the limits of your knowledge. Working in a team, with students from different backgrounds has already been really educational.
In the team I am the PR (Public Relations) manager. This means that I form the intercessor for the contact with the media. Besides that I update our social media with nice photos and our activities.
Outside of iGEM I play mandolin and guitar, ride on my horse or enjoy a good workout at the gym. If the weather allows it, I like skating and running. On top of that I love to bake a nice pie or cake, which is never a bad thing when you have a group of this many girls.

Fun Activities
Besides eating a lot of cake and pizza, we also organized some fun activities with the whole team this summer!
Weekend in Een, Drenthe | 15-17th July
It’s important to get to know each other when you spend such a great amount of time together working on iGEM. This why we organized a weekend away with the team. We went to a small village, Een, in Drenthe, a province in the Netherlands. It was a nice break from working in the office and lab. We took a relaxing walk, cooked together, had a barbecue, and spent the evenings by playing games, and drinking wine and cocktails. On the last day the weather was so nice, that we decided to take a swim in a lake nearby. This lake lies in a tiny place called Amerika, which we thought was quite funny.
Weekend in Paris, France | 1st-3rd July
The weekend of the European Experience also provided us with the opportunity to do fun activities together that are not related to iGEM. For some of us it was the first time in Paris so we wanted to do some touristic stuff. We all enjoyed getting lost walking around the city and visiting the Eiffel Tower, the Louvre, Notre Dame, Arc de Triomphe, etc.
BBQ at Lycka's | 23rd June
When the weather is nice in the Netherlands there are barbecues everywhere, so we also had a barbecue. We had a lot of food and a typical Dutch ending to out barbecue: eating inside, because of the rain.
Transfer Dinner | 23rd March
We organized a transfer dinner to get to know our predecessors and to learn more about the iGEM competition. Even our secondary PI showed up to the dinner. We ended the night with a party in one of the few discos in Delft.

We all worked really hard on our project and credits go to our entire team.
Carmen
Policy and Practice Manager
As Policy and Practice manger it was my task to “connect” our product to the real world. I was responsible for finding applications for our project. One of those applications, the micro lens arrays as encapsulation layer for solar panels, appeared to be commercially very interesting and I have written a business plan about this application therefore. Furthermore, I have been in contact with multiple researchers, managers and scientists to discuss and improve our project.  Together with Lara, I have worked on a report about iGEM and I think we found some interesting ways to improve iGEM even further. Furthermore, I really enjoyed working with Iris on the Safety tool we have developed in collaboration with the RIVM. Eventually, I have presented the tool during the RIVM and Rathneau event. Next to this event we contributed to multiple other events and it was my responsibility to organize this. Additionally, I have supported Liza with the modeling and I also made the final presentation together with Charlotte.
Célina
Public Relations Manager
As PR manager my function was managing contact with the community. Therefore I placed weekly updates on the Facebook and started a LinkedIn page for the team. I went a few times to our communication advisors of the TU Delft, Wendy Dallinga and Lenny Bakker. They helped me with creating a press release. I also managed to get articles on different websites, magazines and newspapers. For policy and practice I made a little start in looking into how to optimize teamwork within a team. For the wet lab, I helped a few times, such as doing colony PCR, ligation and transformation.
Charlotte
Hardware, Graphics and Safety Manager
My first task was being the hardware manager. For this task I have approached a great amount of optics and photonics companies and requested sponsoring, discounts or borrowing equipment that was required for building the optical setup. Once all equipment was collected I was responsible for building the optical setup and testing our cells in it. Furthermore, I was responsible for conducting all wide field and confocal microscopy experiments, together with Liza. My second responsibility was being graphics manager. Here my main task was designing and making the posters and presentations. Furthermore, this task included designing and making the logo, figures and all outreach materials for the team, as well as making sure that all data from our experiments is represented in a clear and professional way. Lastly, I was the safety manager of the team. This means I wrote the research proposal for our project including all safety considerations and handed in all the iGEM safety forms. It was my responsibility that all ML-1 safety measures were met. Besides my managing functions, I also made and did the final presentation, helped out in the lab, did a little modeling and arranged some conversations with experts for policy & practice.
Giannis
Team Leader
As a team leader I was responsible for the organizational aspects of the project. This means I had to find places for the team to stay and dine in Boston, arrange the registration of the team members and mentors for the Jamboree, communicate with headquarters with problems we had, but also more day-to-day chores such as chairing the weekly meetings and reminding the team about deadlines, and creating weekly updates for the advisors. Additionally, I was involved in the modeling part of the project with Liza. As a modeler I firstly created scattering models for thin films to define the reflectivity depending from the refractive indices, thickness, wavelength and angle, and later, models of electromagnetic waves interaction with the biological microlenses to determine the scattering pattern and any focusing and Eigenmodes model for the laser part of the project.
Iris
Safety Tool Manager
I contributed to various subtopics of the iGEM project. I have mainly been involved in the safety and risk management related topics, a part of policy and practice. I am largely responsible for the implementation of general safe-by-design strategies in the shape of a safety tool. Carmen, our policy and practice manager, and I designed and created the software for this tool. In addition, I have contributed to the lab work, especially in the first phases of the project.
Lara
Finance Manager
As the finance manager I was first of all responsible for the external collaborations and communications. Getting in touch with companies and other stakeholders to receive funds and enthuse them about our project. Besides taking care of all funding, I also was the treasurer of our team, tracking our budget closely. Furthermore, as part of the core labteam, I have spent a lot of time in the wetlab making our constructs and characterizing them. At last, I also made a significant contribution to the policy and practice by co-writing our strategy report and the organization of several outreach events.
Liza
Modeling Manager
As a modeling manager I was responsible for making models underlying the work of the lab team. In order to create these models a good understanding of the physics was required and therefore I also have studied a lot of physics concepts. Therefore I also talked with experts. With my knowledge of the underlying physics I also assisted and advised the lab team. Furthermore I have helped Charlotte with building the optical setup. I also was involved in characterizing the lasing in both the optical setup we build as the microscope of the university. Furthermore I made Transmission microscopy images of the vesicles of the Wageningen team and of our silica  covered cells.
Lycka
Science Manager
As science manager I closely collaborated with the lab manager, María. Our first task was to design all of the biobricks, which we did after a period of literature research. Subsequently, we were the ones spending most time in the lab, working on the cloning and helping out less experienced team members. It was my responsibility to troubleshoot together with María and the advisors, when experiments did not work out as expected. Furthermore, I designed experiments to characterize our biobricks according to literature. When I was not working in the lab, I helped Liza modelling the laser threshold.
María
Lab Manager
My role as a lab manager was to make sure that everything in the lab was ready (equipment, protocols...). Also, I have worked together with Lycka in the science and experimental design of the wet lab part of the project. At the beginning it would be us two in charge of figuring out everything we needed and how it worked and then passed it on to the rest of the core lab team members to be able to work as fast and efficiently as possible.
Tessa
Wiki Manager
As Wiki Manager my first and foremost responsibility was the design and content of the wiki. I designed our wiki according to our house style, created by Charlotte, and I uploaded most of the files. I also reminded others to write pieces for on the wiki, so I could create a page around it. What I really enjoined about being the Wiki Manger is the fact that it was my responsibility to make all the pages both clear and look nice. Therefore, I discussed with every Manger extensively how their page should look like and in that way I was always partly involved in all the parts of our project. Besides this I also spend a lot of time in the lab helping with the cloning of our biobricks and I worked on the InterLab study. I also went to modeling meetings and I helped Carmen with the policy & practice when I had the time.

The main ideas for our project were developed in numerous discussions involving all students and instructors. The supervisors gave us input about the feasibility of our ideas.   All lab work has been done by ourselves, we planned and executed all experiments ourselves. However, we checked in and discussed results and possible experimental setups with our supervisor and instructors. UPLC measurements were conducted by Dr. Nina Socorro Cortina. The design of the wiki page is our work, all artwork, figures, pictures from events and social media content were created by ourselves (unless otherwise stated). Graphics and figures utilized in the above mentioned parts are designed by team members.  We do not hold any rights on the logos of our sponsors, nor did we create or change any of them.   The structure and the content of our Human Practices Report were created by team members only.  Aside of this, intellectual property belonging to third parties is marked as citations and authors are given in the references section of the according report and throughout all our Wiki pages. The poster we use to present our results was designed and written exclusively by the 2016 Marburg iGEM team.

Acknowledgements
At first, we would like to thank our PIs, Dr. Tobias J. Erb and Dr. Gert Bange and especially their lab teams for the intellectual support, sharing their lab space and providing us with materials. Without their teams' expertise and advice for our experiments, results wouldn't have been possible.  Furthermore we would like to thank our advisors Dr. Georg Fritz, Tarryn Miller and Daniel Hürtgen for their time to support us on daily basis, which helped us to solve the problems we were facing during the project.
We are also thankful for the input that Max Mundt, Anne Löchner and Nicolas Krink were able to give us from former iGEM-competitions in the early stages of the lab work. Additional to that the Sourjik lab has supported us with helpful advice as well as several strains and plates.
The group of Prof. Dr. Kahmann, especially Dr. Stefanie Reißmann, who gave us access and supervision for using their microscopes and helped us with gifts regarding lab supply.  The E. coli AB330 strain, which is capable of recombination has been a gift by the group of Prof. Dr. Waldminghaus. pBbA5k-EPL95 was a gift from Aindrila Mukhopadhyay (Addgene plasmid # 45434) and pJBEI-6410 was a gift from Taek Soon Lee (Addgene plasmid # 47049).
We also would like to thank all our sponsors and partners for the tremendous support. The financial sponsoring, the backing with materials and knowledge in handling the given tools has been overwhelming.  Nothing of the work we have done, the lessons we’ve learned and the contacts we’ve made would have been possible without the extraordinary sponsoring from each and every one of our supporting partners.
We are very grateful for every gift and the positive feedback we got by our sponsors. Additionally, we hope that this partnership will keep growing for both sides.

This year, I did part of the laboratory works with upper-class students and managed the contents of our Wiki with other team members. This experience will definitely has a far-reaching influence on me and I’m ready to enjoy this giant event!

I'm so glad to be a member of our team.My main duties are conducting part of the experiments with other team members, participating in writing our web, and giving some ideas of the packing design. IGEM gives us the chance to make a connection between the theory and reality.Meanwhile,it reminds us to be more concerned about the environment and the earth. And most important, it is an excellent stage where we can try out our ideas.Hope that we could return in triumph！

Lucky to join our team! We tried a lot together in order to come up with some amazing ideas to apply for real practice via synthetic biology. By reading papers and books, browsing webs and thinking constantly,finally we’ve managed it! I have to say that good teamwork is much important.My main task is to feed the fishes and assist other teammates in conducting experiments.In the meantime,I also direct the designing work of our team uniform. Anyway, I believe that “Do what must and should do indeed, and we will carry out one day!” COME ON!

Paolo Marangio
Hi everyone! My name is Paolo and I come from Italy. I am currently enrolled in the MSc in Synthetic Biology and Biotechnology. I like electronic music, football and swimming. I have laboratory experience in microbiology and cell biology. I am very interested in algal biotechnology, so working on the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. 6803 as part of the Edinburgh OG iGEM research project is really exciting for me!
Yu Yan
Hi, I'm Yu Yan and I come from China. I like playing volleyball, cooking and shopping. My major is Biotechnology and I have done Bioengineering before come here. This is my first time to study abroad and also the first time to take part in an iGEM competition. In this team, I'm using the MoClo to prototype the plasmids for our non-model organisms.
Tom Laidler
Hey, I'm Tom and I'm from Newcastle. I spent my undergraduate degree in Manchester studying neuroscience and have since seen the light and switched to synthetic biology. Less than a year ago I hadn't heard of iGEM and I'd only seen Penicillium roqueforti on plate. Now I'm getting used to seeing it in a petri dish. I'm looking forward to travelling to Boston and making the case that useful chassis can be found everywhere, even in your cheese!
Ibrahim Al Masoud
Hey guys! I am Ibrahim from Kuwait.  Together with Adair and Matin, we have designed and optimised a modular genetic toolkit for Rhodococcus, in the hope that researchers find it easier to genetically manipulate this potentially model industrial organism.  I have done my undergraduate degree in Biochemistry and I am the only one here doing the MSc Biochemistry at Edinburgh!
Matin Nuhamunada
Hi people!I'm Matin and I'm from Indonesia. I study Synthetic Biology & Biotechnology in Edinburgh. I love sunshine and the warm tropical beach. Outside the lab, I am concerned with education of young scientist (age 12-18) in South East Asia by doing research and innovation. Anyway, this is my first time being an iGEM team! Very excited to play with Phytobricks & MoClo this year!
Anette Salaz Hernandez
Hey everyone! I’m Anette and I’m from Mexico. I’m currently studying an MSc in Biotechnology and, having studied Biotechnology Engineering previously, I’m excited to learn new programming skills and develop a new risk assessment tool for the community! More about me? I enjoy football, binge-watching online content and playing videogames.
Ricardo Camilo Chavez Martinez
Hi there, Camilo here! Also Mexican. I’m studying an MSc in Systems and Synthetic Biology at the University of Edinburgh. I consider myself an iGEM veteran, after participating four times as a student and twice as an instructor…and have been thought to be a masochist by previous Advisers. I enjoy learning new things and being up to date with synthetic biology, and I am currently applying for a position at my favorite company, Ginkgo Bioworks *wink*.
Adair Islas
Hi fellas, my name is Adair and I’m a sweets addict (from Mexico city). I am doing a MSc in Synthetic Biology and Biotech at the University of Edinburgh. I watch cartoons all the time and my favorite kind of music is? mmm I don’t have one but I like groups like Phoenix and Passion pit. I love molecular biology and microbiology and I have worked with opportunistic pathogens. However, my bachelors was in Biology so I know too some cool things about other type of organisms
Alejandra Schiavon Osorio
Hey! I'm Alex and I'm from Mexico! I did my undergrad and MSc in Biotechnology but now I'm taking new risks and doing my PhD in Synthetic Biology. This is the first time I participate in the iGEM competition and I'm very exited about it! Besides the scientific life I enjoy playing tenis, watching movies, videogames but my biggest passion is Scouting and outdoors.
Yaiza Velasquez
Hi, my name is Yaiza, I am studying the MSc in Biotechnology and I am from Colombia. I enjoy cooking, hiking and looking after pets. As part of the iGEM team, I am working on the Interlab study, which is a great oportunity to contribute to the development of more reliable and reproducible methods in synthetic biology.
Meet our Instructor and Advisor!
Thank you for all of the guidance and help during the summer!
Chris French
Chris French is interested in synthetic biology. With colleagues in the School of Engineering & Electronics, they are developing methods to engineer novel biological systems using modular 'parts' and standardized assembly methods. These can be applied to generate artificial genetic networks, in a process we call 'object-oriented genetics', and also to generate multiple variants of metabolic pathways, in a process they call 'combinatorial genetic engineering'.
Louise Horsfall
Louise Horsfall, a Lecturer in Biotechnology at the University of Edinburgh, is interested in multidisciplinary challenges involving Biotechnology and Synthetic Biology. She is the recipient of the University of Edinburgh’s 2015 Chancellor’s Rising Star Award, the elected co-chair of the Bioengineering and Bioprocessing Section of the European Federation of Biotechnology and a member of the EPSRC's Early Career Forum in Manufacturing Research.
Jon-Marles Wright
Jon-Marles uses structural biology, biochemistry and cell biology techniques underpinned by synthetic biology technologies to answer questions relating to the function of bacterial compartmentalization systems and their rational design as platforms for biotechnology and synthetic biology.
Heather Barker
Dr Heather Barker is the MSc Technical Support for the School of Biological Sciences, The University of Edinburgh. She has been with us the whole summer, teaching and sharing her experiences on lab skills and also guides us on our iGEM project. She is in charge of making sure no one burns the lab!
Matthew Edmundson
Matt gained his PhD in Biochemistry at the University of Leeds. He joined the Horsfall lab at the end of 2013 and is working on the CL4W project, engineering bacteria to convert heavy metal waste from contaminated land into industrially and medically useful nanoparticles. In his spare time he likes reading, hiking and kayaking.
Nikolaus Pantidos
Nick Pantidos graduated from Edinburgh Napier University in 2011 with a degree in Microbiology and Biotechnology. He completed an MSc in Biotechnology at the University of Edinburgh in 2012, before starting his PhD studies in the Horsfall lab.

General Support
The Baltimore Under Ground Science Space (BUGSS), a DIY community lab space, is where we spent most of our time working on this project. Dr. Tom Burkett, founder of BUGSS, provided us with the space and lab equipment, and many of the materials, reagents, and enzymes needed for our work in the lab were provided by BUGSS.
Project support and advice
Our project was designed by our team. We had a brainstorm session on August 6th with the help of Dr. Laun, Dr. Scheifele, Dr. Burkett, and Dr. Adil Zuber. During this time, we found a research paper by Yoshida et al., documenting the plastic eating I.sakaiensis bacteria. We found the genetic code for the plastic degrading genes that we utilized in this paper.
Fundraising help and advice
The VWR foundation and the Family League of Baltimore provided us with grants, and BUGSS covered the rest of the cost.
Lab support
Dr. Laun and Dr. Scheifele supervised our wetlab work, which we started on August 6th. They provided us with the procedures we needed, taught us basic lab skills, and answered any questions we had along the way. They were also the ones we went to when we needed advice on difficult techniques, and they helped us by taking pictures of gels and plating cells when our experiments ran really long. Ryan Hammond helped us by preparing plates and taking plates out of the incubator for us.
Project advisor support
A while before the Jamboree, we presented our work to all of the members at BUGSSat an open house event. They listened to what we had and gave us useful advice on how to make our presentation better.
Wiki support
While our team designed all of the content for the Wiki, Jason Coleman, the founder of Sparkypants Studios, helped us create the website structure and add everything that we had written into the website.
Presentation coaching
We put together our poster and oral presentation and had feedback from members of BUGSS and mentors in Johns Hopkins' Medical Education Resources Initiative for Teens program who advised us on public speaking.
Human Practices support
Port Discovery and Open Works invited us to participate in outreach programs to educate and interact with the public. We discussed ethical concerns with our advisors at BUGSS.
Thanks and acknowledgements for all other people involved in helping make a successful iGEM team
Dr.Tom Burkett, founder of BUGSS, provided us with the space and lab equipment, and many of the materials, reagents, and enzymes needed for our work in the lab. The expert advice and mentorship we received through BUGSS, along with the time given up by Dr.Laun and Dr.Scheifele on various days in the summer until the time of the jamboree, allowed us to focus on our goal and complete our iGEM research project. Their support was a catalyst for us to work harder within the lab.
Sponsors
The Baltimore BioCrew thanks our sponsors for their generous support of our team that made our project and travel to the Jamboree possible."

Hello! I'm currently a senior at Western High School and aspire to practice Pediatric Medicine. I am extremely passionate about biology and love appreciating all the things we customarily take for granted. I was born in the New York metropolitan region, but have Brazilian roots. I'm also a MERIT scholar and enjoy spending time with my pets, playing the piano, and eating Italian food.
Ella Coleman
I am homeschooled and currently a junior.  I am fascinated by biology and have loved working in the lab ever since I started in high school classes at CCBC. My favorite activities are knitting, practicing martial arts, and playing the guitar.
Oumaima Driwech
I am a junior currently attending Baltimore Polytechnic Institute who wishes to become a Bio-Chemist within the future. I am from Casablanca, Morocco. Although I am not from Baltimore, I grew up within that venue at the age of one on up. I would always travel to the harbor every Sunday, as if it were a ritual, along with my family. The harbor united my family as I am sure it did to others and seeing the harbor decay over time sparked a sense of sadness within me. Being apart of this program allows me to help discover a solution to this conflict and to, one day, rejoice at the harbor with purity and cleanliness.
Julius Gingles
Hi, my name is Julius Gingles and I am currently a senior at the Baltimore Polytechnic Institute who is a varsity soccer and chess player. Baltimore is my hometown and I consider it to be my safe haven. As someone who wants to make a difference in my community and is in love with the brain’s complexity, I aspire to be a pediatric surgeon.
Eseni Tafah
Hi! My name is Eseni Tafah and I am a Junior at Baltimore Polytechnic Institute. I really enjoy subjects like biology and chemistry with a deep aspiration of becoming a neurosurgeon. I also intend to study neuroscience in college. I was born in Cameroon but I've developed an interest in learning about Baltimore's Inner Harbor.
Mercedes Thompson
I'm Mercedes Thompson and I was born and raised in Baltimore. I have worked with the National Aquarium during the summer for over six years, so marine biology has always been a passion of mine, as is the Inner Harbor. I'm a junior at the Baltimore Polytechnic Institute, and I intend to study biology in college."

Dr Brown gave the initial lecture that acted as the seed for our idea, and was happy to meet with us and discuss his experience with Wilson’s Disease. This guided the initial development of our project.
Professor Kevin Foster
Professor Foster provided us with valuable advice on our chassis and chelator choices. He also advised us on how we might make the bacteria persist for as long as possible in the small intestine.
Professor Jane Kaye
Professor Kaye acted as a springboard for the ethics and public engagement sections of our human practices, highlighting that policy is often dependent on public perception.
Valerie Wheater and the Wilson’s Disease Support Group (WDSG)
Valerie Wheater and the WDSG have been incredibly useful to our project, guiding us from the beginning with their thoughts on various aspects of our project. They invited us to present our project at their AGM and talk to many patients and doctors, which keenly illustrated to us the limitations of current treatments and the lack of rare disease awareness.
Associate Professor Maike Bublitz
Dr Bublitz gave us lots of very helpful advice on protein purification and other techniques we were unfamiliar with.
Cardiff iGEM
Our most sincere gratitude to all those at Cardiff iGEM in particular Rob Newman for setting up the collaboration, Dr. Geraint Parry for setting up the experiment and Dr. Anthony Hayes at the bioimaging unit measuring the our parts using the FLIM microscope. This took considerable time and expense for which we are very grateful.
Crowd Funders and Sponsors
Thank you to our kind Crowdfunders and sponsors for enabling us to have such a great summer!

TEAM
We are a group of five high school students, which aim to promote science in a different, more entertaining and easier way to understand for others. All our performance has been achieved by our perseverance and the help of our tutors. In our team we all have different likes; however, we have joined for a reason: science, in which we have shared very good moments as well as moments of great stress, working late hours and many days in a row, reaching to the conclusion that the life of a scientist is not ""easy"". This experience has helped us to understand how we are going to develop in the future, realizing that all of us will study something that has to do with biology or health.
Members:
Ana Josefa Henríquez Loaiza (16)
“biological engineering”
I am 16 years old, I am a high school student with high skills in science; I have headed the project from the beginning until June 2016, where for group decision I was followed by a partner. In July this year I was invited to participate in the Summer School Global Imperial College London to gain more knowledge and allowed me to strengthen the team in science field. I like working in the laboratory but more in theoretical work, I am also part of the translation of written work. My goal is the study of biological engineering abroad, and working on stem cells and research in aging process.
Hobbies
I like to read (specifically about science), jogging, playing videogames and volunteerism. Also I study classical piano and enjoy outdoor activities.
Antonella Osses (15)
""Medicine""
I'm a high school student. My top priorities are the welfare of the team; encourage it to work and to be more responsible, because these attitudes I have been appointed as the group leader. I love the laboratory work, my performance is good and I enjoy it very much, however, I have worked more on developing presentations, and everything that has to do with computing. Later on, I hope to be an excellent biologist, so that in the future I would achieve my dream that is to study Medicine or something related to science, conducting research, and in parallel to be a professional volleyball player.
Hobbies
my passions are volleyball and science; I also like jogging, hanging out with friends and watch TV series.
Luis Retamal:
""Neurology""
I am a 15 years old high school student; I am in charge of caring of these girls as I am the only man in our group. What I like is working in the laboratory; pipetting, however I am a collaborator in the literature search work and the advertising design. Nevertheless, I am teased repeatedly because I'm the only man in the group and when they talk to the group they often use the term ""girls"". Later on I would like to work on something related to Medicine, without forgetting my passion for the outdoor life and my creative traits, but mostly what I want for my future is to be happy in whatever I do.
Hobbies
I'm a scout, I am passionate about outdoors, I consider myself creative and I like sports.
Valentina Villanueva (15)
“Nutrition”
I´m a high school student. In the project I’m the one who provides the direction of our research, organizing the information that my teammates develop, in this way, I help the advance of our research and also by correcting spelling mistakes. In addition, I try to help my teammates with their problems and thus trying to seek a solution to these. In the future, I still am not sure about what I want to study, it can be nutrition or medical technology, but I hope to fully enjoy what I do. Another goal of mine is to travel and see the world, so I can to have experiences to tell.
Hobbies
I like dancing, listening to music, going out with friends, and also training crossfit.
Antonia Vasquez  (15)
""Marine biology""
I'm a high school student. My contribution to the team is to be the harmony of the group up to being a clown, so that other people feel happy and can have a good time. I like working in a laboratory rather than doing the theoretical work, but I have actively participated in the writing tasks, the bibliographic work, and the presentations design and also in the science fairs. My main goal in life is to study marine biology at the Universidad Austral in Chile and to work in the Caribbean beaches and marine reserves, and in parallel with it, I would to take photography and rescue courses.
Hobbies
I like to share with friends, to practice crossfit training, outdoor activities, and animals, but above all things, science.

As a group we want to acknowledge the help of the people who were with us in the development of our project, because without them we would not be where we are now. Ismael Espinoza is the organizer of our process at the Academy of entrepreneurship, he has helped us in the legal and financial issues of the trip. He also gave us lessons of entrepreneurship.
Javier Villacreces was our professor of molecular biology and genetic engineering. He has been a major advance in our process in the laboratory, working on the wiki and presentations pillar has been our guardian and is responsible for motivating us to be more responsible and to continue working. We also had the help of Oyarce Sebastian and Ana Del Valle who were always there to help us with any questions or problems within the laboratory. Adding the group in 2014 IGEM that shared their experience, and it was important to learn more in depth about the competition. We also had help from the English teacher of our school Rocio Astudillo, who helped us both with presentations and exhibitions of the project and the translation of parts of our wiki, also had English lessons with her for about two months. On the other hand, the teacher of our school Cristian Ramirez has been the guardian of our project, he has supported us in the most intimate aspects of the group, being present to solve our problems, and he has also helped on the legal issues and those related to the travel.
Earlier in the Middle East Technical University, they were devoted to sequence the genes that are responsible for the detection of carbon monoxide in the R.Rubrum, this protobacteria is characterized by the color purple photosynthetic may behave in an aerobic or anaerobic manner, this group managed to identify two circuits designated as pCoof detecting low levels and high levels pCooM detecting promoters. From this first initiative to understand these sequences, and inserting chromoproteins our team used these sequences and Lux ​​system to generate a third intermediate level of detection."

I am 17 years old. I am mexican and I am studying in third semester of junior high at Tecnologico de Monterrey CCM. I am really passionate in science, and social impact action. I describe myself as a very creative, social and smart person. I am in Genetix because it is a group made for science and also have social activities to share and spread science. Its a place where I can be myself, and apport to share my knowledge to others. Also is a way to be in IGem, and develop my abilities to my future, due to the fact that I want to study biochemistry. This development is also useful to my school work. My future aspirations are to work on the scientific field and help the society by this way.

Alan Galeana
High School Student
Human Practices and wet lab member
I’m a Mexican senior IB high school student who appreciates beauty in all its ways, from mathematical theorems to art performances. I am interested in studying how the human brain works and Genetix gave me the opportunity to learn the practical laboratory and research skills that I did not get from my other classes. Most importantly I’ve experienced how dedication and persistence are the key to the solution of difficult problems, which wouldn't have been possible without a team who shared the best of themselves in the pursue of helping and improving people’s lives.
Neyci Gutiérrez
High School Student
Human Practices coordinator and lab member
I am a 16 year old high school student interested in science, music and literature. I joined GenetiX at the end of my first semester. At first, I joined the iGem competition because I wanted to help with the chemical part of the project, but came to like Human Practices and the biotechnological part quite a lot too. iGem has given me several important abilities, such as teamwork, leadership skills and valuing hard work, as well as broadening my interests and perception of the world around me. I am really excited about participating in iGem and learning from other teams as well as showing them that there are hard working people in Mexico looking for opportunities
Carlos Pichardo
High School Student
Wiki Coordinator
I am a 19 year old student that just finish high school and now is entering university to study engineering in computational software. I started to study programming at the start of high school, being now the coordinator of wiki in the group, and taking care of the software. Maybe some people call me crazy, but I think this is the reason I can continue to move forward to a maybe uncertainty future, but sure that I'm capable of doing all the things that I propose. Maybe I really don't know what to do in my future, but i know that it will be awesome because I want to go against the world at my own game. GenettiX for me is a place different to all the world, it will let you realize how awesome the people are.
Rafael Rojas
High School Student
President
I am a 18 year old student cursing my last year of high school at Tecnologico de Monterrey, Campus Ciudad de Mexico. For the first time this year I had the privilege to lead our school’s iGem team, and it’s been the most challenging, fun and engaging activity I’ve ever taken part of. I’ve always been interested in biology, chemistry and physics; but I like how iGem projects integrate what we do in the lab and take it even further, right into the real world. Overall, the iGem experience is without a doubt a fantastic opportunity to get more involved with science and actual research even before college: a life-changing experience I won’t hesitate to recommend to any student interested in the topic!
Triana Sánchez
High School Student
General Coordinator
Science, is something that have always deeply interest me, because it answers the most amazing and vital questions: from the tiniest subparticle, to the most titanic supernova. But what truly interest me within it, is the great potential that we have thrue science to change the world for better. The things that we have accomplished as a scientific community are just terrifically unbelievable and to think what we can accomplish in a few years, just thrills me. I think that both GenetiX and iGem are a great opportunity to start that change. Also, I participate in Models of United Nations (MUNs) . I was primary founder of the Debate Club in Tecnologico de Monterrey and we are going to participate next November on “Panamericanos”. Everything that I do is focused on achieving that change, because I want that every time someone mentions the word “future” they don’t think about a mass of gray polluted injustice, but as a bright community full of opportunities and hope.
Daniel Raisman
High School Student
Coordinator mathematical models
I am the mathematical models coordinator and lab member currently at my senior year of IB high school. I'm currently 18 years old and really interested in natural sciences, cooking, science fiction, videogames and travel. I joined GenetiX whilst on my third semester and decided to participate in the IGem project mostly because of chemistry but also to learn bio-engineering, which I ended up enjoying quite a lot, and I decided to take up the task of creating and coordinating the mathematical model. This project has given lots of abilities and knowledge, as not only have I learned the basics of bio-engineering and biology in general, but I have also become very adept at chemistry and lab practices , even taking a course on the subject. It helped a lot with teamwork, because it is taken to a whole new level when working on such a big, multidisciplinary project and it widened my perception of the world and the possible routes for my academic future.
I am very eager and excited to participate on a competition of such magnitude and international recognition. It is an amazing opportunity to learn more about the world and the different cultures by meeting people from around the world with a similar way of thinking. Such a multicultural event is one in a lifetime chance, and doing it together with a group that has become a second family to me is more than I could ask for.
Luis Rojas
High School Student
Finances coordinator
I am a 16 year old IB student studying at Tecnológico de Monterrey, Campus Ciudad de México. I’m interested in science (especially medicine, chemistry and biotechnology), music and sports. I joined GenetiX during my first semester because it fitted with my interests and I wanted to expand my knowledge outside of what I was given in class. iGEM has given me the opportunity to discover a whole new world and improve my scientific and research skills. However, the competition has not only given me knowledge but a group of friends how I consider like my family now. I’m interested in comprehending how the human body works, as well as what can I do to improve my world with the knowledge I have acquired so far.
Marcial Díaz
High School Student
Human Practices coordinator and lab member
I am a 17 years old student at Tecnologico de Monterrey, Campus Ciudad de México. I´m interested in chemistry and Biotechnology, music and sports. I joined Genetix during my third semester, this has given me the opportunity to develop my knowledge and to gain experience in laboratory, it has also helped me to improve my research skills and amplified my comprehension of why things happen. This team is like a new family for me, they have teached me, helped me and guide me through all this year and I am in debt with all of them.
Jorge Arias
High School Student
Human Practices and lab member
I am a 17 years old student at Tecnológico de Monterrey, Campus Ciudad de México. I am a highschool student that adore science. I prefer chemistry and physics, but I find biology interesting. I joined the team the last year so this is my first iGem competition. I joined because I wanted to improve on my searching skills and got more knowledge.
Danya Ortega
High School Student
Human Practices and lab member
I am 16 years old and I'm currently cursing my last year of high school at Tecnológico de Monterrey, Campus Ciudad de México. I'm really interested in math, literature, music and chemistry. This is my second time participating in an iGEM competition, and this is my fourth semester as a member of GenetiX. Both GenetiX and iGEM have given me an opportunity of improving my research and analysis skills, and showed me a new version of the world in which I can actually learn how and why things happen. As a part of GenetiX, being able to help the team with projects and ideas has been an amazing experience. In this team I have found friends rather than only work partners, and in the knowledge I've acquired while participating in iGEM and being part of the group I have found a new way of understanding everyday events.

This year our team consists of enough characters to fill a Dr. Seuss book and then some. We are a dynamic group of intelligent, fun, loving students dedicated to making a change. Like any great team we have really learnt and grown from one another this year, meaning we have all gotten a little smarter, a little more creative, and definitely a little crazier. All of this has contributed to making one fantastic year.   This year we really wanted to showcase our team. We gave our team members 150 words with absolutely no restrictions, here is what they wrote.
My name is Blaise. I enjoy long walks on the beach, sports, technology, and chilling in my DXRacer in my basement playing games. This is my first year in iGEM, it's a bit overwhelming, but I plan to get through it and look forward to going to Boston. My parents tell me I'm cool, so I am.
""Hi my name is Aerodactyl. I have a combat power of 1867 and 681 hit points. I also have a very strong attack. When I go into battle the first thing I usually do is use my Aurora Beam, this weakens the enemy so initiate my special attack. I do wiki btw..."" -Alex
Special Agent 009
Name: Alina Arvisais
Known Aliases: Aluna, Gregory, Momma Susan.
Last know location: the office, working.
Current mission: expressing bacterial keratinases to break down hair and feathers.
Trained in: shaky lab work, staring at a computer screen for hours, and never ending research. Also skilled in areas of rock climbing and running (be aware of if attempting a chase of special agent 009).
My name is Talia Dixon (also known as Queen B).  I am a grade 12 student who has been participating in iGEM since the 9th grade.  I help with every aspect of the project.  My other interests include debate, speech, social justice, volunteering, student council, handball, hockey, and doing Buzzfeed quizzes. Quick facts about me: I am constantly tired; I am a coffee, gum, and Coca Cola addict; I am always hungry; I am perpetually freezing cold; and my favourite colour is black, because it resembles my soul.  In the future I plan to attend university to pursue a double major in journalism and political science, as one day I would like to be a foreign correspondent.
Hi, I’m Jadon.  Why am I in iGEM?  Idk… science is pretty cool.  I play sports sometimes too.  This is my first year in iGem and I am really enjoying the field of work. I am the only grade 11 student not doing wiki so I have plenty of older knowledge helping me out.
Hi, I'm Maria! I am a grade 12 student and a second year participant in the iGEM program.  I like science and sports.  My hobbies include travelling and watching terrible reality TV.  I also enjoy spending time with my family and friends, a nice candlelit dinner, short walks on the beach (I get tired easily), and injuring my knee too often.  Does this stop me from having a good time?  No! I put all my effort into all my activities, such as iGEM, and loving those around me.  I, as a well-travelled microbiologist, like to say I’m pretty cultured.  With these many qualities I hope you consider me as a participant on the Bachelor (of Science).
Bonjour! My name is Chasey and I’m a graduating student at OLS. When I’m not at school or in the lab, I like purchasing more books than I know what to do with and reading almost all of them. I also surf the Internet (because living in the mountains actually makes the other surfing pretty difficult). I started ballet dancing as a toddler and though I like to tell myself I was a super talented 2-9 year old, I actually ended up switching styles, resulting in my current status as a certified Highland dance teacher. Kilts over tutus, am I right Freya? This is my first year in iGEM, but my 16th year as a papercut survivor. Oh, and I also like to believe I know a lot of French, which I think was demonstrated amazingly in my opener.
Hi! My name is Freya and I’m a grade 12 student at OLS.  This is my third year in iGEM.  I enjoy working hands on in iGEM because it is such an amazing opportunity to expand my understanding of science as a whole. I am definitely 100% related to Josh. I like to think that I am funny.  Right now I’m struggling with what to wear to iGEM.  Maybe designer genes?  When I’m not in the lab, I pretty much live at the dance studio, with multiple tap, ballet, and modern classes almost every day. I also teach tap classes (tap shoes over bagpipes Chasey) and work as a lifeguard at our local pool. Some of my talents include: being British, procrastinating, and getting sunburns way too easily.
Hello, I'm Naoto and this is my first year in iGEM. It's definitely awesome learning about synthetic biology and to work on our project. So far, I’ve done lab work for our team, some writing, as well as helping to present our project. When I'm not in iGEM, I'm either playing guitar, longboarding, or hugging trees. Other hobbies of mine include procrastination, running from my responsibilities, and binge watching Game of Thrones.
Hi, my name is Nick and I am a grade 12 student at Our Lady of the Snows. This is my first year in iGEM. When I am not doing iGEM, I am either eating my feelings or depriving myself of much needed sleep.
Hi! My name is Olivia and I'm a grade 12 student at Our Lady of the Snows. This is my first year in iGEM. My life isn't very exciting so (insert life story here ... ).
Hello my name is Josh! I am a third year Synthetic Biology student in Grade 12. This year I had the pleasure of creating our very first bioreactor! Me and my totally legitimate twin sister Freya love to be in the lab working on our construct and the bioreactor. In particular I love learning about science and contributing what I can to innovate and evolve the scientific community! When I’m not slaving over the bioreactor I like to spend my time biking, running and swimming so that I won’t drown in my responsibilities. I adore long calming walks on the beach with lots of dogs and hope one day I will live out my dreams of doing exactly that.
""First year iGEM member, 18th year capitalist survivor"" -Acacia
THANK YOU TO OUR TEACHERS AND MENTORS THIS YEAR! IGEM IS A BIG UNDERTAKING FOR HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS AND WE COULD NOT HAVE DONE IT WITHOUT YOUR HELP!
Mr. Arvisais: Congratulations for reading this far down the page.  It takes a special kind of person to read the Bio down near the end of the document.  Enough about you, I am a high school math/science teacher in my last trimester of a teaching career.  In this third year of iGem I almost know what is going on in Synthetic Biology and the tremendous strides that have been made in having synthesized parts delivered to our high school door for a modest cost - or - even free.  I continue to be thankful for the opportunity to ride this breaking wave of change along with a supportive OLS team and comprehensive Alberta mentorship to our small school.
Mrs. Puurunen: After considering life, I decided I have too much free time.  So when I’m not being a mom to my five-year-old, teaching biology, Special Education leading, Master’s degree finishing, mountain bike racing, camping/travelling or volunteering, I am Synthetic Biology-ing!  I finally feel like I’ve satisfied the E. coli needs in my life.  Working with this team is a highlight to my role as an educator - there is no other experience like it.  Special thanks to the students who work extremely hard at this project every day, to Luc for starting the program up in the first place, and to our Alberta partners who make this endeavor possible.  #SynBio4Life!

CryptoGErM was made by the following people. Our supervisors can    be found in Supervisors and we were also helped by the people and organisations mentioned    in Attributions .
Eike Mahlandt
I am Eike and I am the chairwoman of      this year’s iGEM team Groningen. My task is to keep the team happy      and make sure there are always cookies around. About me, I am from      the North of Germany and here in Groningen I am doing my Master in      Molecular Biology and Biotechnology. During the last weeks I      discovered that I enjoy running in the mud but I am also an      excellent popcorn cook and I knit my own socks.
Bente Hofstra
Hey there! I am Bente and I am in charge of our educational      work and coordinating public relations. I did my bachelors in      biomedical sciences and obtained my teaching degree during that      time. I am now doing a master in medical and pharmaceutical      drug innovation (MPDI). In my free time I like to chill inside      with a good book, some wine and my cat. To add some physical      activity I like to go skating and play volleyball.
Daniel Devlitsarov
I’m Daniel, lab manager for the iGEM      team of Groningen. My academic background is in biomedical lab      research and molecular biology, although now I am focused primarily      on synthetic biology. I am originally from Estonia, but I moved      around a lot. My main tasks for iGEM are      obtaining lab equipment and materials, helping plan the labwork and ensuring biological      safety. Besides that, I like to be involved in other aspects of      iGEM like proofreading emails and writing assignments,      contacting potential sponsors and helping with the artwork. When I am not in the lab, I’m out      taking photos (mostly landscapes and urban photography) or doing      stuff in my garden. I also like to go on hiking trips when I have      the time.
Sambit Das
I'm Sambit. I come from the city of      Pune in India (right next to Mumbai). My role in the team is mostly      centered around the wet lab. I like spicy food, and enjoy cooking      with friends. I am doing my masters in Behavioral & Cognitive      Neuroscience in Groningen. I am fascinated by the mechanisms      involved in making behavioral decisions, so apart from my mice in      the lab, I also like to observe animals in general.
Luis Suarez
My name is Luis Suarez - yes!!, like      the football player before somebody asks... I was born in Mexico      and I am a chemist. Since I like to plan almost everything, I am in      charge of the travel to Boston and am part of the Human Practices      of the team.
About me? Well, I am a simple Mexican...      Eurovision fan, cinephile (you can find me three or four times per      week at the local cinemas here in Groningen), failed writer and      party boy - BEST MEXICAN DANCER EVER!!!
Oh! I almost forgot      it, like a good Mexican I love Tequila, Fiesta and      Sombreros!
Matthia Sabatelli
I'm Matthia and I'm the Italian member      of the team (half Italian actually since my mother is Belgian).
If you search for me in the lab you won't find me, my role in      the project is in fact playing with numbers and computers. I'm an      Artificial Intelligence master student and I will try to compute      the mathematical models of what the guys will create in the      lab.
I like playing chess, make some noise with my electric      guitars and go out jogging when it rains.
My favorite color      is brown, not because I particularly like it, but since I'm      colorblind it's the color I see the most.
Mareike Schmidt
I am Mareike and I'm the sponsorship      manager of our team. My task is to convince companies and      institutes to support our project. I grew up in the north of      Germany and now I'm a master student in Molecular Biology and      Biotechnology, so during the summer you will mostly find me in the      lab.
If I'm not in the lab I like climbing rocks and cooking      dinner with my friends.
Bára Waclawiková
My name is Bára, I’m the lab manager of CryptoGE®M 2016. My      job is to make sure that everything in the lab is going      smoothly and according to the plan. I’m from Czech republic,      but not from Prague, more east, from Olomouc which is the      second most beautiful city of Czechia. I'm a master student in      Molecular Biology and       Biotechnology.
I really like      movies, sports, reading books and hanging out with friends.
Kathinka Frieswijk
My name is Kathinka and I'm the vice-chair of CryptoGErM (or      SpyGEM for close friends). Except for our logo, I made pretty      much all of the drawn images on the wiki. I'm also in charge of the design of the poster. I have bachelor      degrees in Medicine, Mathematics and Physics and am currently      following masters in Theoretical Physics and Operations      Research.
I absolutely love being outside, so I spend      most of my time studying on the grass in front of the faculty      building. When I'm forced to stay inside, you can always find      me near (or hanging out of) a window. Besides drawing, I like      playing beach volleyball and dancing. In my free time, I try to      trick random birds and forest animals into becoming my pets,      mostly without success.
Ilona Mager
My name is Ilona and I am the Secretary of this year’s iGEM      team. One of my duties as Secretary is to make notes during the      meetings. A little introduction about me: I am from ‘The Far      East of the Netherlands’ called Twente. Currently I am studying      Biology and Medical Research at the University of Applied      Sciences, Enschede.
One of my favorite things to do is watching cute animal      video's on the internet. In addition, I like reading very much.
Carlos Ramírez
My name is Carlos. I have a bachelor in      Pharmaceutical Engineering and I´m currently enrolled in the master      degree in Molecular Biology and Biotechnology. I am a lab rat in iGEM.      Also doing some molecular dynamics and computational analysis. As such,      I like molecules and play video-games.
Peter-Jan van het Hof
My name is Peter-Jan and I’m the      treasurer of our team. Besides that, I help obtaining sponsors for      our project. I grew up in a lovely small village in the middle of      Drenthe. I have a bachelor’s degree in Applied Physics and I'm      currently enrolled in the master Applied Physics. In my free time I      love to take my bike out for a spin. I also like a BBQ and hanging      out with friends.
Marco Gunnink
I'm Marco, resident code-monkey. My      major is in Computing Science, hence my tasks in the iGEM team are      data management and the Wiki. I'm also responsible for the software part of our project.      In my spare time I like to play video      games, programming and reading. Sometimes all at the same      time.

Each team must clearly attribute work done by the student team members on this page. The team must distinguish work done by the students from work done by others, including the host labs, advisors, instructors, and individuals not on the team roster.
Why is this page needed?
The Attribution requirement helps the judges know what you did yourselves and what you had help with. We don't mind if you get help with difficult or complex techniques, but you must report what work your team did and what work was done by others.
For example, you might choose to work with an animal model during your project. Working with animals requires getting a license and applying far in advance to conduct certain experiments in many countries. This is difficult to achieve during the course of a summer, but much easier if you can work with a postdoc or PI who has the right licenses.

Thanks and acknowledgements for all other people involved in helping make a successful iGEM team
Can we base our project on a previous one?
Yes! You can have a project based on a previous team, or based on someone else's idea, as long as you state this fact very clearly and give credit for the original project.

Tell us if your institution teaches an iGEM or synthetic biology class and when you started your project:
Does your institution teach an iGEM or synthetic biology course?
When did you start this course?
Are the syllabus and course materials freely available online?
When did you start your brainstorming?
When did you start in the lab?
When did you start working on  your project?"

Andrew Brimer
Second Year Biomedical Sciences
Worked in the lab
Only wears St Johns branded gear
Andrew is an aspiring medical student, with strong links in community volunteering. When he isn't busy leading St Johns Ambulance teams he works in the wet lab, sequencing every successful PCR, or setting them up. Alongside this he put his years of training cadets to use in presenting our project in Westminster and in Boston.
Rob Newman
Second Year Genetics
Worked in the lab
Shouldn't be left unsupervised with dry ice
In charge of the FUEL side project, Rob designed the primers and assisted in the biobrick design that he would be working with. He also planned FLIM experiments with Oxford for collab. When he wasn't working on these he was: procuring and experimenting with Vibrio harveyi for outreach, 3D designing/printing, helping out in the lab/outreach, and reaffirming his inability to web design.
Nik Demetriou
Second year Chemist
Worked in the lab
Slept in the lab
Nic the resident Cypriot was a core part of the wet lab team. Reliably set his hands to anything asked of him, Nick was a true workhorse.
David McMaster
Second Year Biomedical Science
Worked in the lab
Instagrammer
With the project he worked on the bigger picture, working in the wet lab and ensuring time efficient work schedules, as well as presenting our project in Paris and Boston. A proven leader and proven light weight.
Laura Bird
Second Year Biology
Worked in the lab and design
Resident artist
As the only core Biology student, Laura was involved in the wet lab practical work and our artistic efforts, designing our logo as well as our initial project posters.
Christian Donohoe
Second year Chemist
Worked in lab
Has physically carried team on his back
As a chemist on a GMO project, Chris developed himself outside his field, gaining skills in practical microbiology and computer science through his work in wet lab and leading the wiki content and design. He also ventured outside some days, presenting the project in Paris and Westminster, as well as designing and presenting our poster in Boston.
Asal Golshaie
Genetics Student
Human Practices guru
She likes poetry
Coordinated Human Practices. Organised all outreach events, consulted experts, and undertook the STI self testing kit investigation. In the lab, she was sometimes found cloning, and mostly lurking in dark rooms, testing her cultures for light. Initially organised collab with Oxford and WashU. Presented in Boston.

NOTEBOOK
Foreword
We were the first Cardiff University team to enter iGEM, and only 2 of our PIs had experience with synthetic biology, so there was a steep learning curve, hence we sought out assistance when required. From this project we will have gained valuable insight, and are well placed to mentor future Welsh teams.
As a smaller team than most, all members got dirty in the lab to some degree, as well as giving a hand in public engagement events. That said, there were still defined roles in the team.

We thank Xiaowo Wang and Zhen Xie, PIs in Department of Automation, Tsinghua University, for their tutoring and providing bench space for wet lab.
We thank Lei Wei and Weixi Liao, PHD students, for their support on experiment design and modeling.
Team training and Project start
The students in the Tsinghua-A team came up from different majors. We took courses together and had special training in synthetic biology and bioinformatics. All of the designs, constructs, models, human practices and experiments presented in Tsinghua-A’s Wiki were performed by students of the 2016 Tsinghua-A team. The instructors and teaching assistance were providing feedback and advice about the experiments and models. And they also give us lab support and help with the presentation coaching. We are proud of completing the project on ourselves.
Our instructors teach a synthetic biology course and we start the course in September, 2015. It is a pity that the syllabus and course materials are not freely available online but we are lucky to take the course since we have learned a lot of useful knowledge. We started our brainstorming in January, 2016 and we start our project and do our experiments in February, 2016. We are glad to have an opportunity to do a complete project by ourselves and we have fun doing it."

In biological world, when information flows through gene-regulatory networks, it may cause noise. Through the information theory, we use modeling computation and wet lab work to realize biological significance of recurring parallel designs in nature. Therefore, we combined the research theory of biology and automation. We are composed of 2 students from department of biology and 11 students from department of automation. Different from the other teams, because most of us are from department of automation, our project has a lot to do with information theory. We use the knowledge of probability theory, information theory, cybernetics, and so on to predict and verify the experiment. Not only most of our experiments verified the theory, but the predict is almost the same with our experiment result. Compared to other teams who use biological experiments to finish the actual operation and practical application, we focus on realizing the knowledge about life world, which is more like theory research. Both application and theory research are the two important keys in biological research. Our work is divided into experiment, modeling computation, human practice, web page, etc. Following is our members and works:
Inspiration
You can look at what other teams did to get some inspiration!
Here are a few examples:
METU Turkey
Colombia
Stony Brook
OUC-China
What should this page contain?
Include pictures of your teammates, don’t forget instructors and advisors!
You can add a small biography or a few words from each team member, to tell us what you like, and what motivated you to participate in iGEM.
Take team pictures! Show us your school, your lab and little bit of your city.
Remember that image galleries can help you showcase many pictures while saving space."

the team, leading the design of the project, fundraising for project expenditure, and coordinating
between instructors and team members. He will be presenting the project at the Giant Jamboree.
Huang Yiming is the vice leader of Team Tsinghua in 2016. He was in charge of establishing the
framework of our Wiki page, constructing a crucial dCas9 expression plasmid for the following targeting
test and building quantitative models to optimize wet works.
Wu Bohou is a molecular cloning master in the team, and the vice leader of Team Tsinghua
in 2016. He conceived the blueprint of gene surveillance system, initiated the in vivo proof-of-concept
experiment as well as the following yeast experiments and constructed a majority of BioBricks.
Zou Xinzhi contributed to the initial design of the suicide system. She is the master of yeast
in the group and conducted most of the yeast related experiments. She also delivered several
work update reports to our supervisors. She will be presenting the project at the Giant Jamboree.
Jin Qiao built quantitative models to achieve dose optimization and precise regulation of
dCas9 expression,constructed key plasmids for the proof-of-concept experiment, and presented our
project at the 4th iGEM conference at Taiwan.
Lu Yao is a supportive coordinator throughout the summer. She contributed to the suicidal
system and the dCas9 expression plasmid, engaged actively with the public including hosting a workshop
and interacting with the Tsinghua Xuetang Program, and will be presenting at the Giant Jamboree.
Ge Chenghao has been consistently contributing tremendously to in vitro experiments, including
sgRNA transcription and protein purification, participated in the proof-of-concept experiment and
presented our project at the 4th iGEM conference at Taiwan.
Yan Jun is a relatively independent member. He initiated dCas9 protein expression and purification,
as well as the following in vitro binding experiments, where he proposed and carried out a
fluorescence-labeling method as a practical alternative to isotope labeling of sgRNA.
Jia Zeran has been devoted to plasmid construction and in vivo imaging experiments in yeasts,
including yeast electroporation and generated an important figure for the final presentation. He
will also be presenting the poster at the Giant Jamboree this year.
Luo Mingjie was in charge of the Taiwan conference communication this summer and delivered a nice
presentation. He also contributed to the construction of the suicidal system, and helped with
documenting experimental notes onto our Wiki.
Yang Sichen is an excellent photographer and movie maker. He generated all profiles of the
team and helped produce the video which explains nicely the working mechanism of our project
and its potentially far-fetching implication.

General guidance
This year we would like to thank the general guidance we received from Prof. Dai Junbiao,
Prof. Chen Guoqiang and Prof Sun Zhirong. They have patiently supervised our project
throughout the entire year and provided insightful advices on how to design a novel yet feasible
project, how to troubleshoot experimental setbacks and circumvent technical difficulties, and how
to deliver a clear presentation, to name but a few. Without their help we could not have made
achievements to such degree.
Lab space
Prof. Dai’s laboratory provided a welcoming environment for our team to think creatively
and carry out experiments freely. We have essentially all the access to any lab equipment and
reagents that are indispensable for our project. We are also very grateful to all lab members from
Dai Lab, for helping us to troubleshoot the project and tolerate our constant occupancy of the lab
space. Dai lab provides experimental facilities that are essential for the molecular cloning and
general bacteria- and yeasts-related experiments, such as yeast transformation and culture.
Material and facility support
We would like to thank Prof. Gao for lending us the micropulser for yeast electroporation,
and an epifluorescence microscopy for yeast-related imaging experiments. We would like to thank
senior members from Prof. Chen’s lab for showing us how to perform yeast electroporation
and lending the micropulser for yeast electroporation.
sponsorship
Financial support
We would like to thank our department School of Life Sciences and the Tsinghua Xuetang Life
Sciences Program for their constant support, including providing funding necessitating wet
experiments and covering for flight tickets and costs for accommodation. Students from the Xuetang Program
proposed brilliant ideas that can help improve the feasibility of our project. We are also grateful to
Novozyme for generously providing us a grant worth approximately 30,000 RMB.
Wuxi Qinglan Biotech has also been enerously synthesizing several key constructs encoding thymine
kinase and C2c2.
We are also grateful to multiple plasmids synthesized by IDT Inc, a service provider that has greatly
helped us and proceeded our progress smoothly.

Medicine is my core passion, but I enjoy learning various fields of science, including bioengineering. I struggle to identify myself in terms of ""where I am from""; my DNA tells me I am Chinese, but my nationality is Malaysian. However, I was born and raised in Tokyo, Japan, and I go to an American school, but English is not my first language. Albeit my ambiguous origins, I can easily identify what I enjoy in life. I have played the violin for 14 years and piano for 3 years (I am 17 at the moment). I enjoy playing music as a way to escape from stresses (such as trying to explain people where I'm from). I enjoy being a part of this team's building project, contributing as a co-leader. I look forward to how this idea will expand as well as our maturation as people and as teammates.
Kien Malarney
I am 17, and I am from Tokyo, Japan. In the team, I work on research and experimental design. In addition to neuroscience, I hope to study biochemistry and molecular biophysics.

Students
We are...
Mathilde Gonthier
INSA
I am a fifth year student in Biochemistry and Biotechnologies at INSA Lyon. I discovered the iGEM competition in 2013 while I was providing support for the European Jamboree organization.
Instantaneously, I was attracted by the scientific aspects of the concept as well as the human ones. Thus, I joined the 2016 iGEM team in order to learn how to elaborate a project from the subject's definition to the experiences and the presentation of the results. During the summer, I specifically worked on fluorescence revelation, streptavidin part design and characterization, cloning experiments and final parts characterization tests. During my leisure time, I love traveling and practicing sports like dance.
Julien Orlans
INSA
I am a fifth year student in Biochemistry and Biotechnologies at INSA Lyon and in Bioinformatics at the University Claude Bernard Lyon 1. Since I heard about synthetic biology and all its possibilities, I wanted to take part in a project from scratch and build a complete system. That’s why I joined the iGEM team INSA Lyon 2016 in order to realize this ambition. During this summer, I worked on the molecular modelling of the 3D structures of our different aptamers and on the homology modelling of our protein of interest.
Louis Becquey

4th year student in biosciences, and now ported on bio-informatics and mathematical modelling, I have heard about the iGEM several times last years and always wanted to join a team. This year, I tried ! I am glad to help the team making real discoveries after a modelling work and numerical calculations. The tool we built to compute the most probable aptamer structures was one of the first great bio-informatics project I contributed to. This iGEM contest experience was therefore a good training exercise of teamwork and software development.
Gianina Ungurean
INSA
I am a fifth year student in the department of Biochemistry and Biotechnologies at INSA Lyon. I am a person who enjoys challenges and a place in my university iGEM team fits me. Having to build a project from scratch motivated me and indeed, in the end this project turned out to be a very enriching experience. Apart working on molecular cloning, I was also able to use my passion for visual arts in the benefit on the project. I worked on the molecular animation and I was also in charge with the Communication and Publicity.
Delphine Bourgeon
INSA
Student in fourth year in Biochemistry and Biotechnologies at INSA Lyon, I am very interested in working as a team and in carrying out a project from the beginning to the end. I especially appreciate the way we can mix both sciences and humanities in one project. Consequently, I worked on the Human practices and I took part in the achievement of the InterLab study.
Margaux Poulalier-Delavelle
INSA
I am a fourth year student in Biochemistry and Biotechnologies at INSA Lyon. Since I discovered it, I am a real synthetic biology enthusiast and naturally joined this year iGEM team. Working as a team, building and participating in this project was really fulfilling and enriching. Moreover I am really interested in the human aspect of our project and the improvement it can bring to our society, so I took part in the human practices in addition to the InterLab study.
Mathieu Borel
INSA
I am a fifth year student at the INSA Lyon and Lyon Science University where I am studying biochemistry. I have always been amazed by synthetic biology's possibilities and achievements. So two years ago I joined the IA2C, which is the student association taking care of the iGEM organization. Ever since I started to work on synthetic biology as a hobby. The iGEM 2016 is the pinnacle of this work. In the future I hope to get a science PhD, and may be work in the synthetic biology field !
Paul Zanoni
INSA
I am a fourth year student in Biochemistry and Biotechnologies at the INSA of Lyon. On the beginning of last year, I was very curious to explore the world of the synthetic biology and to take part in a team research project. Joining the INSA Lyon iGEM team was the good choice. I had the chance to follow the project from the early brainstorming to the wiki redaction,  in many domains ( interlab, human practice, parts characterization, revelation system, microfluidics assay) as an helper. I was really interested in studying the impacts of synthetic biology in the society and the human issues. Taking part in a such project was an exciting experience in the lab and was also a good occasion to work with people from other disciplines.
Thomas Sabate
ENS
I am a student in the first year of my master's degree in Biosciences at the École Normale Supérieure of Lyon. I decided to join the INSA's Lyon team to discover the engineering way of thinking in biology while my university has a much more fundamental approach. iGEM was a perfect manner to build collectively a whole project started from scratch in synthetic biology. I worked in the wet lab on the development and optimization of the device and helped to characterize Aptamer-proteins interaction. In the future, I would like to work on modeling quantitatively the stochasticity of gene regulation..

I am a mechanical design and production teacher at INSA Lyon. I am specially interested in 3D Printers, that is the reason why I was asked to participate to the iGEM project. I agreed with pleasure because I like working with students on such interdisciplinary projects. I think it is important that students know 3D printers technologies because 3D Printers will provide many opportunities in several domains in the next 10 or 20 years and the iGEM project is an example for this. Otherwise I like to play tennis, to ski and to walk in mountain, and also to cook french food with my family and my friends !

TITLE
Besides the fungal killing switch and the functional prototype that help reduce concerns over GMO
Background
Our project is comprised of four parts,  the introduction, part design, prototype, and human practice. Let me introduce some background information regarding our project. The Oriental fruit fly is a serious agricultural pest. It can consume more than 150 types of vegetables and fruits and primarily affects tropical areas. According to research, in 2004, Asia produced 178 million tons of tropical fruits, amounting to 66% of the global production worth US$2.5 billion. Because Asia is mainly a tropical environment, these fruit flies can decimate the agricultural industry. They can cause 90% to 100% yield loss depending on the fruit fly population, locality, variety and season. In other words, the oriental fruit fly poses a great threat to our global food supply as it can destroy most of the global produce.
Oriental fruit flies are wreaking havoc worldwide. It accounted for an annual loss of $176 million in California and billions worth of damage in Taiwan. Furthermore, it devastated fruit production in Africa, causing more than 80% of crop damage. As a result, various countries, out of fear, impose trade restrictions and refused imports of produce from Africa, leading to significant economic losses for Africa.
The ravages of oriental fruit flies are also not limited to tropical areas. This is a global issue. They have plagued approximately 60 countries worldwide and the issue is worsened by international transportation, which can spread the oriental fruit fly eggs. This is why the issue of oriental fruit flies needs to be solved and our project aims to solve this problem.
Here are a few traditional solutions to the oriental fruit fly, but each of them are far from perfect.
#1: One of the most effective approach is contraception or male annihilation, which uses high-energy radiation to sterilize the male and in turn prevent reproduction. This is ineffective, however, as wild female flies can differentiate between sterilized males and non-sterilized males.
#2: Another way is baiting, which uses pheromones like methyl eugenol to attract male oriental fruit flies into traps that kill them. This is still ineffective however, as the female fruit flies, being the one capable of reproducing, are the real problem but are unaffected by methyl eugenol. There are other more ways like bagging, spraying pesticides and early harvesting but none of these are perfect solutions.
Our project aims to solve the shortcomings of these previous solutions. Our fungi is a biological agent that takes biosafety and environmental conservation into consideration.
What is Metarhizium anisopliae?
Metarhizium Anisopliae is an entomogenous fungi, Or a fungi that can act as a parasite and seriously harm them.It can infect over 300 hosts but different strands have highly specific hosts. Because various strains of Metarhizium Anisopliae already exist in soil, it doesn’t alter the environment, making it eco-friendly.
M. Anisopliae however, is vulnerable to environmental stress like low humidity, temperature, UV exposure… Etc. Thus, scientists are currently genetically engineering M. Anisopliae to solve these shortcomings. But, because of certain laws and policies that bar GMO products from entering the market, biopesticides using M. Anisopliae is still uncommon.
Traditionally, biosafety is achieved by selecting strains with low UV tolerance or low heat tolerance to ensure that it dies under uncontrolled environments. This, however, compromises on its virulence and applicability. Thus, our project aims to mitigate these GMO concerns without compromising its virulence and vitality."

Professor Chang always gives ideas that only takes time and patients to understand. He likes to take picture whenever we stay up late, trying to capture each and everyone of us when we are working the hardest. We still do not understand why he acts like that. He gave us great encouragement and always back us up. The 2016 NYMU iGEM team is not complete without him.
Dr. Chang trained us to do iGEM experiments, and she always has immense patience to help us and teach us. Even though we were troublemakers sometimes, she was still willing to give us good advice and let us try out various experiments. During those experimental times, we are really grateful to her for all her great help and care. She takes care us like our mother but sometimes herself a cute little girl. She always encourages us to never give up and help us in any way she can. Without her we never could have gotten this far.
Professor Tsai is insightful and thoughtful. She is usually very busy, but always finds time for us to give critical and insightful comments. As the instructor of our human practice section, she always encourages us to try new things to human practice to a whole new level.
Words cannot describe how awesome Mr. Clapper is. He always comes to the meeting room with big smile. Though we usually speak Chinese in the meeting, he still pays attention to every last detail of our discussions and put our thoughtful ideas and words of encouragement when ever it is necessary. We owe him a great deal for his suggestions to our circuit design and many other aspects of our project. We cannot thank him enough for the contributions he had made to our team."

Saie Ganoo - Team Lead
Biological Engineering ('18)
Saie Ganoo? Don’t you mean Saie GaYES? You’ll never meet a more spirited, motivated, or hardworking individual than Saie. She puts the ‘gem’ in iGEM and the ‘tada’ in Team Lead. If you ever need to watch an uplifting Facebook video featuring cute animals or to call someone right away in excitement about a random idea, Saie is your girl. Saie spends 400 hours a week on iGEM, but in her spare time she is a full time biological engineering student, a proud member of Theta Tau, an RA, probably an astronaut???, and all around one of the best friends you could ever ask for!
Yifan Chen - Wet Lab Lead
Biological Sciences ('18)
With about a month left until competition, one truth has become abundantly clear to the team members toiling away in our wet lab space: everything that can go wrong, will go wrong.
For the lab is dark, and full of errors.
However, all is not lost. Cornell iGEM has a secret weapon: Yi Fan Chen, our glorious Wet Lab Lead. Yi Fan can defy all physical and chemical laws that govern the success of molecular biology techniques. When he touches a miniprep or protein purification, it magically works, better than it has ever before! He is the light that guards the realms of synthetic biology.
Outside of iGEM, Yi Fan works in a lab and spends the remaining three hours in his day regenerating his supernatural powers as he sleeps.
Grace Chuang - Policy & Practices Lead
Chemical Engineering ('18)
Grace Chuang.
How do I even BEGIN to describe Grace Chuang?
""Is her name Grace? Because she is amazing.”
“A fellow papercut survivor.”
“I had a wedding just so she would do a photoshoot for me.”
“I heard she opened a restaurant...”
“...but everything was plated on cutting boards.”
“One time she tripped...so I tripped too.”
“She rules Policy & Practices with an iron fist.”
Sachi Koide - CS/ECE Lead
Biological Engineering ('18)
Spunky and sweet and like a koi[de] fish swimming gracefully and nimbly amongst code and animation, Sachi is a talented junior Biological Engineer who has found her niche in the world of iGEM. This dedicated, wonderful human being started in Wet lab but worked her way up to take hold of the CS/ECE team by storm. On campus, she can be seen running through Ithaca chasing adventure and if you ever see a swish of color, it’s probably her blue/green/purple/ hair flying past. If you ever need someone to approve of your puns or somebody to help you with app design or somebody to run with you around campus, fish aren’t food but Sachi is the one for you!
Stephanie Yiu - Product Development Lead
Chemical Engineering ('18)
Shall I compare thee to a drylab wizard?
Thou art more lovely and more temperate:
Rough winds of CAD do shake the wizard’s drive,
And temperamental printers do test it:
But thy love of cows shall never fade,
Nor shall the obstacles thou hath,
Allow thy sass to be waylaid.

Rishabh Singh - Design & Marketing Chair
Biological Engineering ('17)
In the eons past, men have offered up their prayers. Men wished for reason, for they sought the meaning of existence. Men also wished for sentience, for they wished to make their souls known to others. In the present days, we know these prayers have been answered – the design of ancient languages convey to us the wisdom and memories of old. But evidence suggests that these creations did not arise independently. Whether it’s ancient Sumerian or Egyptian hieroglyphics, whether it’s ancient Chinese or the Mayan script, experts believe that these designs were all inspired by the same unknown power. Attempts to identify and harness this power of creation has been unsuccessful, for it has always so skillfully evaded the records of history, leaving just enough traces for all to marvel at its grace and crave for its strength. However, the latest evidence suggests that this power, which came to be known as “Rishabh”, has recently taken residence in Ithaca, NY, inspiring novelties in synthetic biology through its peerless designs and sassiness, while stimulating the economy by circulating currency into Taco Bell and Chipotle. Everyone waits patiently, observing with anticipation, for they know that Rishabh is about to compose the next turning point in history.
Greg Albano
Biological Engineering ('19)
I am a sophomore, majoring in Biological Engineering in CALS, but I am more well known for being obnoxiously tall, prone to blocking the sun from the shorter members. My accomplishments include being making burnt burgers for the iGEM BBQ, which they were forced to scarf down, playing chess in CS 1110, and admiring my multiple failed gel electrophoresis attempts. I also made it my desktop background because I believe failure is the road to success. During the summer, I was awarded with the position of the iGEM social chair because I talk more than I’m supposed to and I often carry a stress ball because you can always be making #gains for the fingers. Although my accomplishments and experiences are by far large and impactful, I consider myself statistically insignificant compared to the rest of my stellar teammates. I will be often found in my suite in Keeton, living the life of a lucky West campus bastard, so hmu if you actually get a good time slot.
I can be described by the 3 following emoijs: 💩🤓¯\_(ツ)_/¯

Swathi Chakrapani
Biological Engineering ('19)
With a personality as big as the city she hails from (NYC), Swathi always has something sarcastic to say. Swathi is a big proponent of eating good food, especially super spicy food. Her bag of Indian spices is the secret ingredient when making homemade Chipotle burrito bowls. On iGEM, Swathi is a master pipetter and also a great companion for watching Netflix on the nice Mac in the lab. In the other hours of the day, Swathi guards swimming pools with her life, and enjoys yelling at children to stop running on the pool deck. Swathi also has a knack for spraining her ankle whenever she goes outside. And a final word of caution, don’t mention Stuy to Swathi – as an alum of Hunter, Stuy will forever hold a place in her heart as her fiercest rival.
Jonlin Chen
Biological Engineering ('17)
Jonlin Chen is a life traveler -- from Ithaca to Peru, Singapore. She got to hone her sandboarding skills at Peru then went on a quest in NYC to find the best donuts in the city. So if you are craving for some good donuts, ask Jonlin for her spreadsheets of rigorous donut ranking system. She's not only a foodie and a traveler but a past president who has continued to provide invaluable feedback and advice for the project this year. She is also our dedicated alumni relations chair connecting our team to our numerous successful alumni. Jonlin will forever be with us and her legendary contribution will forever be glorified.
Tara Chari
Biological Engineering ('18)
Tara is a Junior studying Biological Engineering at Cornell.  When she's not busy accidentally spilling drinks everywhere or getting lost in the woods with her dog, you can find her working hard sequencing genes in Weill.  Sometimes you will find Tara volunteering as various events such as busting science myths with children.  Running on a healthy diet of bubble tea, Tara strives for nothing but the best and provides support to many people in the community.
Fion Chu
Human Biology, Health, and Society ('19)
Fion Chu may be small. She may be cute. She may love pandas. But watch out: she's also a football and hockey watcher. She's a powerhouse and she WILL call you every day to ask if we can visit your farm, leave 10 voicemails, and stalk you on White Pages. And then struck by her persistence, you will find yourself agreeing. Ready to conquer the world as a future anesthesiologist, she's a wet lab and policy & practices dedicated member by day (and let's be real by night because #lablife) but a pie and cobbler baker...by later night? Don't pronounce her name wrong or mess with her. You'll regret it.

Jeremy Fidock
Biomechanical Engineering ('17)
A senior in Mechanical Engineering, Jeremy loves working on creating new medical devices, a passion that he puts to good use on our Product Development subteam. If you ever need to find Jeremy for some advice on the next cutting edge medical device, or just a good chat, know that Jeremy is a man of many probable locations. At any one time, he can be found doing problem sets in Duffield, studying outside Weill Hall, or fiddling around with MakerBot in Phillips 105. A self-proclaimed “nerd”, Jeremy loves to work on CAD projects or tinker with Arduino in his free time. If you are having a hard time finding Jeremy on campus, try looking at one of the many bodies of water surrounding Ithaca, where you may find him spending a lazy hour or two fishing. If you still can’t find him... then you’re a bit out of luck because he’s probably traipsing around Europe with his family, or as he hopes, backpacking in Asia with his friends. Who knows where Jeremy will go next???
Carol Hung
Biomedical Engineering ('19)
Carol Hung.
How do I even BEGIN to describe Carol Hung?
""Carol Hung is flawless.""
""I hear her minipreps are insured for $10,000.""
""I hear she models...for iGEM.""
""Her favorite ingredient in cooking is salt.""
""I hear she has a pet elephant in her dorm room.""
""One time she met Bill Nye the Science Guy on a plane...""
""And he told her she was cool.""
""One time she punched me in the face...it was awesome.""
Sneha Kabaria
Chemical Engineering ('19)
It’s 12am. An angelic voice emanates through Weill Hall, masking the sound of ungreased wheels on chemical carts.  Unclear if Taylor Swift has appeared in the flesh in the iGEM lab, or if it’s Sneha Kabaria.  Suddenly, a wild Sneha appears from behind the leaning tower of pipet tip boxes.  She claims she’s been completing transformations, but we all know she’s been debating politics with Greg for the past 7 hours.  Beware of her skills, in the lab or on the debate team, because she is passionate about pretty much any topic you can think of, and can present her opinions as cleanly as sterile technique and as sharply as a gel knife.  Although she loses her bracelet at least 3 times a day and breaks her phone every other day, people need protective goggles when they look at Sneha because she is as bright as UV light.  Her dedication to the team models her dedication to vegetarianism and to Eggplant Parmegianna, and we are excited for her to present at competition – maybe she’ll figure out her major by then!
Emily Lang
Biological Engineering ('18)
You have had a rough day and need to go into lab. As you walk through the halls you realize how the basement of Weill Hall is seems so so sterile and emotionally cold, with it being windowless and having an all-white decor and all. You start to wish you could be out in the sun or even anywhere where you could know what time it was by looking out a window.  However, when you enter the iGEM lab all feelings of confinement fly away and your spirits lift as you are greeted with a sunny, bubbly personality pipetting a batch of thirty PCR tubes at a time, (yes… thirty). Hailing from the Jersey Shore, Emily is a junior studying biological engineering with flowing strawberry blonde locks, striking blue eyes, and a wonderful smile. She is amongst the most caring people you will meet, always considering others in the manner of a true “green” personality, doing such extraordinary gestures as driving fellow team members all the way back home to NJ. Her caringness extends beyond to the just the human race, having decided as a rather precocious child that eating animals is inherently wrong. She has embraced vegetarianism ever since. Emily is also quite athletic, playing field hockey and going on runs at dusk in the glowing sunset despite the problems with her hip. She also possesses the truly amazing ability to fall up stairs. (She may be a bit clumsy, but we love her anyway!) When Emily is not working hard for the iGEM team, she can be found working hard in the recesses of Kroch library or in the home of all engineers, Duffield, or alternatively going on adventures the great outdoors (to counteract the coldness that is Weill Hall of course.) Wherever she is, be sure to note that Ms. Lang will always put a smile on your face.
Connie Li
Chemical Engineering ('19)
Connie is a sophomore Chemical Engineering major who works on iGEM's wetlab subteam. Originally from Hong Kong, China, she now lives in Corning, New York. Corning? Like the glass? Yeah like the glass. Ask Connie anything glass-related, and she will be happy to fill you in on facts she learned while working for the Corning Museum of Glass. Since joining iGEM, she spent this last summer kindly but firmly convincing Enterocin to express a peptide that will combat bovine mastitis. She now continues to work with this bacteriocin in an effort to treat mastitis in cows.
Maia Mirchandani

When she isn’t working with her project teams or doing her homework, she enjoys watching Game of Thrones and Gotham and occasionally playing casual sports. She also enjoys listening to “generic pop” on the radio. In order to get through her busy schedule she relies on Sour Patch Kids, Indian food, and creative croissant recipes as fuel. On CUGEM’s business sub team she secures sponsorship opportunities for the team and also works to advance our entrepreneurial prospects.
Amanda Ong
Computer Science ('19)
Amanda Ong is known by many names: “Conquistador of C;” “Jabberwocky of Java;” “Prognosticator of Python;” “Monica Ong.” She is skilled: quick as a sparrow, sharp as a tack, and a prolific midrange scorer.  Her hobbies are eclectic: she collects antique taxidermied moose heads, is the 2016 Tompkins County Log Rolling Contest champion, and still manages to volunteer for PETA in her spare time.  Storied as her past may be, the most intriguing aspect of Amanda’s character is her future.  She intends to start her own technology company, Oongle after college, and top the Fortune 500 by the tender age of 25.  If three words were to describe Amanda Ong, they would be: the better twin.
Monica Ong
Computer Science ('19)
Monica is a sophomore majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Business. In addition to iGEM, she does research with Professor Anderson in technological advancements in education. She is also a member of CUAppDev, but she agrees that iGEM is phenomenally better. When she emerges from her CS 3110 cave, she can be found window shopping for cute things, making videos, or attempting to curb her obsession with double chocolate chip muffins by grabbing another one. When she is not trying to multitask five things at once, she can be seen hanging out with her wonderful, amazing sister Amanda (#bowdown) as well as her comrade Conrad (aka Connie) and her suitemates.
Taylor Song

As a girl, Taylor lived in the US, Korea, and New Zealand before finally deciding to settle in Ithaca, New York after hearing about Cornell iGEM. Outside of iGEM, Taylor enjoys listening to music and playing tennis. She’s got a long list of ex-lovers, who will tell you she’s insane. But no fear - she has a blank space for you. As a dry lab connoisseur, Taylor works at the intersection of biology and engineering by helping to design the milk module system. She is currently pursuing a co-op in Connecticut. Come back soon Taylor, we miss you! She’s got our team singing -  “Is it going to be forever? Or will it go down in flames?
Casey Zhang
Biological Sciences ('17)
Casey Zhang is a senior biology major who is definitely NOT premed. If you're lucky enough to catch Casey awake on campus, you'll probably find her catching Pokemon or dancing with Cornell E-Motion. You might able to find her playing trumpet for the Big Red Marching Band in an alternate universe, but not this one. The next time something breaks in Casey's Wines lecture, it won't be a wine glass--it'll be Casey breaking the heart of the guest lecturer that day.

TEAM IIT KHARAGPUR
DOING HARD WORK JUST LIKE AS MA & PA TAUGHT US
Team Profile
Let’s meet the team of IGEM 2016 from IIT Kharagpur.        We are a group of 24 people of the department of Biotechnology pushing each other towards a common goal of making lives of people better by our contribution through synthetic biology.        It’s our sophomore year in IGEM. We are new to the game but we make up for it with our passion and enthusiasm..        We believe on a famous quote by Colin Powell, “A dream doesn’t become reality through magic, it takes sweat, determination and hard work.” And well, we try to put it in action as much as possible. Our group is dedicated and we don't mind burning the midnight oil or sidelining our vacations if that's what it takes.        Someday, this team of youngsters will have  a visible impact on the world. But for now, our goal is iGEM!        We have been very fortunate with our guides who have been very patient and extremely during our whole venture. It was quite interesting and a learning experience with many ups and downs which we all faced as a team and become only stronger by them.
Our Team
Starting from ideation till experiments, Rhushikesh has been the front force in the team. He believes that synthetic biology holds the key to numerous scientific discoveries. Being the team leader, he spends most of his time in Lab, exploring the plethoral world of science. Besides his scientific endeavour, he loves photography, badminton and is a great guitarist.
Rhushikesh Mr. Front charge
Having spent most of his time in the field of molecular biology, ramesh always comes to the team’s rescue. Let it be protocol optimisation or brainstorming, he always takes the call. Besides science, he loves to play hockey and believes in hard work.
Ramesh Mr. Dependable
Adarsh is someone who won’t let you down. He can handle any type of work, be it setting up a digestion, or conducting a workshop! Enthralled by the world of Neuroscience, he is someone to watch out for in the near future!
Adarsh Mr. All Rounder
Ranging from CIA agents to us lab workers, every team needs a handler. Someone who knows how to get the work done from each person. That’s where Dipasha comes in. But do not let that fool you! When it comes to biotech, she can give the most experienced of our members a run for their money.
Dipasha Miss. Handler
The most silent member of the team. Pruthvi always works in secrecy, and paradoxically, his work has major impact on our team. Being a part of all kinds of things apart from iGEM, he somehow finds a way to do it all.
Pruthvi Mr. Foo-Bar
Well now this guy can manage like nobody’s business. Having joined this year, he bought to the team what we lacked the most, a sense of business skills. Primarily focusing on the sponsorship part of work, eventually he was also enticed on the dark side of the force, that’s to say lab work!
Nishant Mr. Manager
Shaurya is that guy on the team, who will do all possible things at the last minute, but still manage to surprise you with the level of detail in it. Apart from being a part of the team, he is a hockey player to be reckoned with, famous in the campus for his skills with a hockey stick.
Shaurya Mr. Last Minute
The pillar of our foundation, Chetan knows how to stay calm in any situation. He will assess everything at the start and end of the day and come up with a plan for the next day. He keeps us grounded whenever we get our heads in the clouds.
Chetan Mr. Pillar
If anyone is responsible for handling most of the non wet lab work, the designing and the web site areas, it is Sanjay. He can handle an immense amount of responsibility without much complaint. He makes sure we all meet our deadlines each and every time, to ensure that we stay in the run for iGEM.
Sanjay Mr. Rear Guard
Jugal is our substitute for Google! We can ask him any doubts that we have, and he will always have an answer. Extremely well versed in the area of biology, he periodically keeps astounding us with the reach of his knowledge.
Jugal Mr. Knowledge Hub
There will be nothing wrong in saying her as perfectionist. She does each and every task so perfectly and nicely. Whether it’s about presenting the ppt to various institutes or doing biobricks.  She is amazed by the fact how engineering can be used to understand biology and how it can lead to new inventions. She loves to play keyboard .
Payel Miss Perfectionist
It is perfect to describe him as a monk with inner peace. He is curious and try to explore secrets of this mysterious world. He is the most balanced person in the team who remains calm in very serious situation and handles them calmly. He is always a call away whenever he is needed.
Lovish Mr. Peace
The spirited person defined himself as wacky ,tireless and a powerful ball of fire. Aman is the most energetic person who is always ready for the challenges. He can make you believe about the thing which even he is not sure about. He  has managed everything for making our presentations possible for IGEM.
Aman Mr. Spirited
She is ready to do the work ranging from wet lab ,notebook to human practices.   She is very optimistic person,who always looks on the positive side of everything.   Always cheerful and ready for her contribution in any aspect.The charm of life sciences always fascinates her,especially genes and its applications.
Pravina Miss Diversified
The Wiki Stud!!!      This years IGEM website of IIT Kharagpur goes to her. She has handled all the web stuff.She believes that she always look towards destination, and strives to do things beyond expectations. Always motivated, she works with a fighting spirit. If she asks you something,you just can’t give any random funda to her, she wants logic behind each and every thing in this universe. Besides this, she loves to listen music
Manvi Miss Logical
Vaishali is the most peaceful person in the team. She does not come under pressure in  any situation. She used to procastinate the work but manage to finish just before the deadlines. She loves tennis and cricket.
Vaishali Miss. Procastinator
He is the design master of our team.A very creative and dedicated person and a simple learner believe in the roots. He is very humble and down to earth person , ready to help       Everyone. If some work is given to him, he never let you wait for that and make sure that he has done nicely.
Amit Mr. Creative
He is the wikipedia of biology. If you have any doubt about anything,there is no need to google ,he will always be there with a answer. Always done and dusted for the IGEM.  Although he is a member of wet -lab team but also contribute significantly to the non-wet works also.
Akhil Mr. Stud
Being a collected person, there aren’t many things that faze Bhumika, and this is the attitude that she brings to the team. This quality of hers has led to all the seniors relying on her to get something done. A believer in core biology, she likes to diversify by playing Tennis.
Bhumika Miss Steady
PROJECT INSTRUCTOR
Being courageous enough to believe in a team of inexperienced amateurs, right from our initiation, Prof. Ganguly has been the driving force of the team.  He has filled in the gaps in our knowledge and has taught us anything that we didn't know. He has been a reassuring presence to the team, and we can always rely on him to show us the correct path.
Professor Agneyo Ganguly
Although he may be the secondary PI, Prof. Maiti’s devotion to the team is no less. We have looked upto him to help us smoothen out the wrinkles in our plans
Professor Mirnal Kumar Maiti
PROJECT ADVISOR
Bharath is a 5th year student in the department.  He was a part of last years team and has been gracious enough to help out this year too. Just like a parent guides a newborn child in the world, Bharath has guided us in wet lab work. He has seen all our blunders and has taught us how to be better versions of ourselves. He has forged us into able weapons of mol bio!
SRIRAM BHARAT
The man of action, Yogesh is also a 5th year, and a part of last years team. He has been our guide, making sure that his experiences of the last year make us a better team this year.
YOGESH
An endless source of coffee and advice, Harsheel continues to be a part of managing the team. Having experienced the rigours last year, he knows the pressure points and how to deal with them.
HARSHEEL
Just like his batchmates, Varshit, a 5th year and part of the last years team, guides us in the art of collaborations and surveys, apart from inspiring us to give back to the world.
VARSHIT
One of our two strongest supporters, Swagata Ma,am is a PHd student. She is always willing to stay late in the lab whenever we need assistance. Without these two people, it would be fair enough to say we would have gotten nowhere.
SAWAGATA
Shikha Ma’am is a PHd student, and our second supporter. She has taught us all the lab protocols, lab etiquettes, handling the equipments and much more. Along with her colleague, she has been our advisor since the initiation.

About the team
Are you searching for the dream team of your life? Search no longer!
Our team is composed of 20 skillful and brilliant students from several fields. In Paris Saclay's team you can find biologist students from Paris-Sud University, AgroParisTech, ENS (Ecole Normale Supérieur) and the Institut Villebon. We also have computer scientists, bioinformatitians, physicians and for the very first time we have a couple of lovely law students!
The team would never have seen the light of the day without the help of our talented advisors, PhD students and researchers from the Institute for Integrative Biology of the Cell (I2BC).
Like the beginning of every love story we didn’t really knew each other that well, but we spend the best year and summer of our lives together. Our expertise in many fields and cohesion are our strength and it helped us built the I’JAIME project. We all had the chance to experience and learn something new and rewarding. Being part of this team asked commitment, organization and every problem had a solution because we never stop believing in our project.
Our mascot
Crispy is an E. coli matchmaker. He will not rest until he has ""matched"" every lonely DNA molecule to another.

CRISPR Cas-9 Conference
Video summary of the Conference about The Societal Issues of CRISPR/Cas9
We organized a conference in Paris-Sud University about the societal issues of CRISPR-Cas9. Claire, Marin and Laetitia contacted the lecturers. Caroline introduced the CRISPR-Cas9 technology and its origins. Laetitia introduced the iGEM competition and the Paris Saclay's team. The lecturers were Pierre Walrafen, an European Patent Attorney, and Jean Denis Faure, a researcher and professor at AgroParisTech school.
Exhibition at Nanterre University
Paris Saclay's stand at Nanterre University
With the help of Stella Pacheco from the CROUS of Versailles, the TEAM held an exhibition at Nanterre University called ""This is not a Lemon"". Our goal was to raise awareness about Synthetic Biology, collect opinions about it and talk about the iGEM competition with a non scientific audience. Some of us, Caroline, Marion, Alice and Claire were present at the site to meet people and answer their questions. Great learning moment!
Festival Vivant 2016
Coline and Carla
We had the opportunity to promote our project and the iGEM competition during 3 days at the Festival Vivant 2016, held at the Paris Diderot University. Marin, Naiane, Coline, Caroline, Maxence, Carla, Laetitia and Mathilde took turns presenting the project to a broad audience with the help of posters and some cool ludic tools.
Fête de la science
Caroline, Yacine and Naiane
The ""Fête de la science"" is a national event organized by several universities, such as Paris-Saclay university. The aim is to promote science in general and it was another opportunity to talk about our project to a non scientific public. We received mostly families and we explained the synthetic biology to children with ludic tools. Caroline, Naiane, Yacine and Carla were there to represent the iGEM Paris-Saclay team 2016.
Meet-up Ile de France
The Meet-up Ile de France was co-organized with iGEM team Paris Pasteur. It took place on the 6th of August in Pasteur Paris Institute. It was a meeting of several iGEM teams of Paris Region: Paris Bettencourt, Evry, Ionis Paris, Pasteur Paris, and ourselves, Paris Saclay.
Naiane was the one who took care of the organization and communication along with Pasteur Paris teams members. Coline and Léa presented the project during a 20 minutes presentation. A great way to spend a summer day under the parisian sun. A moment which allowed great interaction with other parisian teams and their projects, specially during the ""ice breakers"" picnics.
Vox Pop
Marin and Carla at the Luxembourg's garden
Marin and Carla went with their camera to the Luxembourg's garden in Paris to interview parisians and know more their opinion about synthetic biology. A very unique and sometimes funny experience to get in touch with the public this way. A great way to spend a sunny saturday in a very parisian style: in the gardens. Marin was in charge of editing the video.
Communication
Naiane was in charge of the social networks such Facebook and Instagram. Marin was in charge of Twitter. Naiane was as well in charge of the photography. She also contacted the Paris-Saclay Media in order to promote the iGEM Competition and our team's project inside the Paris Saclay Complex.
Carla designed the team's logo and the marketing strategy with the romantic thematic ""Get DNA Closer"".
Project and Biobrick design
In order to build our project we had to do a lot of bibliographic work and meet researchers who helped us to develop the project.
Dr. Olivier Espéli, a reseacher and an expert in Genome Dynamics studies at the Collège-de-France, accepted to receive Victor, Manhaz, Marion and Philippe. The main purpose of this meeting was several to exchange informations concerning the guideline of the project, more precisely: to discuss about a reporter system (visualisation tool) and which area we should target (for instance: ter site or replichores right).
Dr. David Bikard, a reseacher at the Institut Pasteur in Paris and an expert on CRISPR/Cas9, received Victor, Caroline and Léa. He helped our team by choosing which orthologous dCas9s to use in our project, in order to maintain the sgRNA/dCas9 recognition specificity.
Caroline, Léa, David Bikard and Victor
Our project was split in two parts: Visualisation and Linking Two DNA Strands. For the visualization part, Caroline, Charlène and Léa made all the bibliographic research and designed the biobricks.  Maxence, Victor, Coline and Manhaz were in charge of the linking tool part of the project.
Financial support
Yacine and Carla were in charge of contacting different companies which could potentially support the Paris Saclay's project and the trip to Boston. Alice, Marion and Fabio met a scientist from Mondelez Company who asked a presentation of our project ""Get DNA closer"".   Claire was the mediator who got us the financial support from the Office for Science & Technology at the Embassy of France in the United States. Also, as a financial strategy our team also got involved into a crowdfunding campaign. To explain our project to a wider public, we made a video which was released together with the campaign. Carla did the drawings shown on the video and the voice-over. The video equipment was provided by Martin and filmed by him.
Laboratory
Without our sharp lab team, our project would have never seen the light of the day. The teammates working during the months of June, July and August were: Laetitia, Naiane, Mathilde, Caroline, Marion, Léa, Charlène, Terrence and Alice. During the months of September and October Maxence and Mahnaz continued the experiments and they were the ones who assembled the final biobricks. Furthermore, the instructors (Claire, Marie and Olivier) and the PIs (Philippe and Sylvie) have guided the team during all the lab work.
During the lab work, we've met several people who willingly helped us:
Emmanuel Dassa for providing the lab itself
Isabelle Hatin and Olivier Bugaud for the cytometry
Dr Annick Jack for the Western-Blot
Sylvain Pendino and Myriam Swist for helping us with the medium preparations and sterilizations
Chantal Bohn for help us with the many sequencings
Model
This part of the project was almost entirely done by Marion, our bioinformatician. During the summer she worked hard to build our models. Fabrice Leclerc, Claire Toffano-Nioche, Emily Drouineau and Matthieu Sarazin helped a lot and gave very important feedback for this aspect of the project.
Wiki Design
The Design of our Wiki was done by Gaetan and Carla with the help of Maxime Schaffhauser, a web writer student and it has been programmed by Fabio. Furthermore, Marion and Terrence, who have the best skills in IT, gave a strong support on the Wiki design development. The Wiki construction was supervised by Maxence.
To sum up
To sum up the attributions part, we've set up a table to show what each team member did, with all the informations previously presented.

One of Justinas’ aspirations is to create an automated house which attunes itself to the tenants needs based upon their behaviour.
Katie Stevens
MSc Natural Sciences
Katie is doing a MSc in Natural Sciences because she couldn’t narrow down her choices in the field of science. Natural sciences has given her flexibility to choose from all the nearly science modules at UEA making it the perfect compromise. Katie’s friends consider her a music snob, but she likes to contradict that statement as she just has amazing taste in music.
Nancy Teng
BSc Biomedical Science
Nancy is currently studying Biomedical Sciences at UEA. Originally, her plan was to study medicine but realised she is more interested in the why as opposed to what. The immune system is a particular interest and what Nancy hopes to focus on in the future. Outside of the lab she enjoys a game of volleyball and snapping some photos while out and about travelling.
Peter Frazer
MSc Chemistry
Peter is a student at the University of Leicester, however he lives in Norwich and kindly volunteered his summer to come help the NRP-UEA team. Peter studies chemistry, and expresses a particular interest in synthetic chemistry which includes organic and inorganic chemistry. When not in a lab coat, Peter enjoys playing volleyball and various other games.

This page is used by the judges to evaluate your team for the Attributions bronze criterion .
Delete this box in order to be evaluated for this medal. See more information at Instructions for Pages for awards .
Each team must clearly attribute work done by the student team members on this page. The team must distinguish work done by the students from work done by others, including the host labs, advisors, instructors, and individuals not on the team roster.
Why is this page needed?
The Attribution requirement helps the judges know what you did yourselves and what you had help with. We don't mind if you get help with difficult or complex techniques, but you must report what work your team did and what work was done by others.
For example, you might choose to work with an animal model during your project. Working with animals requires getting a license and applying far in advance to conduct certain experiments in many countries. This is difficult to achieve during the course of a summer, but much easier if you can work with a postdoc or PI who has the right licenses.

Our Team
Attributions
Dr. Amber Willems-Jones
Was the principal advisor to the team, she has been a continual source of guidance in our project and the running of the lab. Dr. Willems-Jones was instrumental in the creation, development and support of our lab and project, without her help the 2016 Melbourne iGEM team would have been impossible.
Dr. Leon Helfenbaum
Dr. Helfenbaum helped supervise and guide us in our biochemical techniques including the use of the more advanced equipment in the lab. Additionally he often helped troubleshoot when we ran into difficulties and provided sage advice when it was needed.
Associate Professor Paul Gooley
A/Prof Paul Gooley helped oversee the planning and design of the StarScaffold project. In particular he helped to guide the structure of the molecule and assisted in the planning of expression experiments.
Associate Professor Heung-Chin Cheng
A/Prof Cheng was instrumental in the creation of the team as a continuation of the 2014 Melbourne Team and advised us since the team's inception on design and planning issues. A/Prof Cheng has also generously allowed us use of critical equipment in his lab, without which our lab could not operate.
Dr. Heather Verkade, Dr. Alana Mitchell, and Dr. Terry Mulhern
Drs. Verkade, Mitchell, and Mulhern helped supervise our lab work. They were all incredibly generous with their time and saved us at the 12th hour more times than one can count. Without them we would not have been able to maintain regular laboratory hours and critical project momentum.
Brent Smith, Lynn Tran, and Maz Corrales
The biochemistry teaching lab technical staff were always there to help us when we (often) needed them. Without their incredible generosity and wealth of biochemical expertise we would have been completely lost this year.
Sean Lowe
In particular we'd like to thank Sean Lowe from the 2014 iGEM team for his advice and guidance in setting up the team and for his efforts in helping establish a Melbourne University iGEM community.
Peter Collins
We would like to thank Peter for his advice during the formation of the team.
The 2016 Melbourne iGEM Team was founded as an extracurricular group in a disused biochemistry laboratory across from the biochemistry staff offices. We began brainstorming and setting us the lab in February 2016. After much deliberation we decided on the StarScaffold and we began to flesh it out. After several months we ordered our DNA and began Lab work in early July. Training occurred throughout as we learnt new techniques and new people joined the team. Hopefully our hard work will come to benefit later years.

Come And Meet Our University
Ben Gurion University of the Negev
Ben-Gurion University was established in 1969 as the University of the Negev with the aim of promoting the development of the Negev desert that comprises more than sixty percent of Israel. The University was later renamed after Israel's founder and first prime minister David Ben-Gurion, who believed that the future of the country lay in this region.
Be'er-Sheva
The largest city in the Negev desert of southern Israel. Often referred to as the ""Capital of the Negev"", it is the center of the fourth most populous metropolitan area in Israel. Beersheba is located on the northern edge of the Negev desert 115 kilometres (71 mi) south-east of Tel Aviv and 120 kilometres (75 mi) south-west of Jerusalem. The city is located on the main route from the center and north of the country to Eilat in the far south. The Beersheba Valley has been populated for thousands of years, as it has available water, which flows from the Hebron hills in the winter and is stored underground in vast quantities

Collaborate with us
Collaborations
Collaboration between scientists is essential in order to excel and to achieve fast progress. In our day and age people from other countries, and even continents, can communicate easily and exchange information in various ways. We feel privileged to have met and communicated with people from so many different countries and cultures. We got help from teams who assisted us in improving our system offering to incorporate their own projects and previous knowledge. In exchange we ventured to help them, using our own experience and resources available to us.

Mentors
Neel Joshi
Neel is an Associate Professor of Chemical and Biological Engineering at John A. Paulson Harvard School of Engineering and Applied Sciences. He is developing new biomaterials constructed from engineered proteins and peptides. The overarching goal of his research is to extract innovative design principles from materials and systems that are the product of natural evolution and recapitulate them in synthetic systems where their physical properties can be precisely tuned to suit biomedical and biotechnological needs. Current projects employ a range of approaches, including synthetic chemistry, protein engineering, directed evolution, and molecular biology.

What we did:
The iGEM team was responsible for:
Conducting all wet lab experiments
Wiki adaptation and content
Graphic Design, photography, and figures
Contacting experts and conducting interviews
Special thanks to our advisor Neel Joshi, Ph.D., as well as to our host lab-- the Joshi lab-- at the Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering and to our mentors, who guided us through the experimental design of our project and dedicated their time to helping us analyze and interpret our results and data. We would also like to thank the John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, which generously supported our summer research.
Mentorship and Support:
We would like to thank:
Pichet (Bom) Praveschotinunt
David Lips
Kevin Hof
Ethan Alley
Harvard iGEM Club for their administrative and logistical support
NEGEM for valuable feedback on our ideas and presentations
Our Inspiration:
We would like to acknowledge previous researchers both within and outside iGEM, whose work informed our design and experiments:
Yoshida et. al. Their 2016 Science paper A bacterium that degrades and assimilates poly(ethylene terephthalate) discovered and characterized the enzyme that forms the basis of our project design. The paper also documents the catalytic activity of PETase expressed in an E. Coli chassis.
UC Davis iGEM 2012 We adapted their pnpb assay protocol for our own experiments to determine the catalytic activity of PETase. They showed that pelB worked as a signal sequence for sending LC Cutinase (which is similar in size to PETase) to the extracellular medium, which gave us evidence that it might work for PETase. Read more on their work here.
Oxford iGEM 2015 They showed that YebF, a protein naturally secreted to the extracellular medium in E. Coli lab strains, when fused to their protein, successfully secreted the protein to the outer membrane.
Bielefeld iGEM 2013 Their work on blueprints for a 3D-printed microbial fuel cell and with exogenous mediators provided a useful foundation on which we built our project.
Northeastern iGEM 2016 Their rigorous collaboration assays helped inform our holistic view of our project design.
Shigematsu, Department of Materials and Life Science, Graduate School of Science and Technology, Kumamoto University, 2-39-1 Kurokami, Kumamoto-City, Kumamoto This is the lab that discovered the D. tsuruhatensis bacteria from a domestic wastewater treatment plant and published Delftia tsuruhatensis sp. nov., a terephthalate-assimilating bacterium isolated from activated sludge.
Human Practices Support:
We would like to thank:
The Seabin Project for taking the time to speak with us and for discussing potential collaborations between our projects.
Parley for the Oceans for sending us samples of ocean plastic to use in our research.
BosLab for inviting Harvard BioDesign to volunteer at a public outreach event, 'Building with Biology.'
Prof. Peter R. Girguis: Professor Joshi suggested reaching out to Professor Girguis, a member of Harvard's faculty who has previously led an iGEM team. His work was of particular interest to our team because it entails, among other things, developing microbial fuel cells for marine environments. The professor provided a number of technical suggestions: he advised the use of titanium wires instead of copper as they release ions and disturb the potential results we will get. He also suggested using a Standalone voltage data logger for voltage and current measurements and data computing. Girguis also encouraged us to consider the economic viability of our fuel cell project. To help illustrate his point, he discussed his own research and explained that in the case of electronic devices in remote locations at the bottom of the ocean, microbial fuel cells can be more cost-effective than alternatives such as batteries that need to be constantly replaced.
Erika Parra, Ph.D. Parra is an associate of Harvard's Department of Organismic and Evolutionary Biology. She has extensive experience working with fuel cells and was kind enough to visit our lab space at the Wyss to help us assemble our cell.
Dr. James Weaver: We initially visited the machine shop and they directed us to Dr. Weaver to help us optimize Bielefeld’s MFC design. He noted some design problems in the blueprints for the microbial fuel cell parts. He therefore suggested three changes: extension of the “ear-like” structure, where the bolts go, in the frames as well, besides the shells, so that the frames are better centered; remodeling of the channel that the fluid flows through so that better mixing is induced; and elimination of the “lips” in both the frames and the shells so that the silicone sealing works better and fluid leakage is prevented. Dr. Weaver also helped with the 3D printer that works with UV light, located in 60 Oxford Street, part of Harvard's School John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences (SEAS).
Prof. Derek Lovley: Prof. Derek Lovely is one of the leading experts of microbial fuel cell (MFC) technology and has conducted numerous lectures on the economic viability of MFCs. We had a conversation over the phone with Prof. Lovley. on June 21. He suggested looking at specific literature for the building of a microbial fuel cell. SInce platinum is expensive, he thought that the use of ferricyanide as a catalyzer would work as well. He advised to make the chamber anaerobic, because the organisms would otherwise transfer electrons to oxygen instead of the anode itself. He suggested to start off with finding an existing anaerobic digester, such that engineering one might not be necessary. Prof. Lovley noted that Geobacter and Shewanella are usually used in microbial fuel cells but that we may need to use another species if we want our bacteria to metabolize terephthalic acid.”
Buz Barstow, Ph.D.: Professor Joshi also directed us towards Dr. Barstow because he has worked closely with MFCs and could help us with the technical aspects of assembling a cell. We consulted Dr. Barstow regarding the use Bacillus and Arthrobacter in a microbial fuel cell, the efficiency of a MFC, and its potential uses. He also provided us with some insightful questions, ranging from fields as diverse as economics to safety. What follows is a message Barstow addressed to our team:
“That’s a really good question. I’m not too sure about Arthrobacter or Bacillus sp. Protocatechuate, and my guess is as good as yours on whether or not they can be used in a microbial fuel cell.
Also, my guess is as good as yours on whether E. coli can degrade (or be engineered to degrade) terephthalic acid. I would do some google scholaring and see what you can find. How many genes are involved in terephthalic acid degradation?
You might want to ask yourselves the following questions: how much do you care about degrading terephthalic acid and how much do you care about making electricity? Also, does the ability to degrade terephthalic acid translate into an ability to degrade PET.
Typically, the yield of electricity from a fuel cell is fairly small, so even a mountain of PET bottles is not going to be a solution to the world’s energy problems. However, degrading a stack of bottles is a solution the plastic pollution problem. My feeling is that a microbial fuel cell is only useful here if it allows you to get rid of reducing equivalents from the cell that you wouldn’t be able to get rid of otherwise (say if you can’t access oxygen due to the need for oxygen sensitive enzymes in terephthalic acid degradation).
Ask yourself the following question: given that Arthrobacter can already degrade terephthalic acid, what bottleneck is preventing widespread deployment of this microbe in the real world? Then try to come up with a solution to that problem.
Also: be aware that Arthrobacter and Bacillus sp. Protocatechuate could also be BSL2.
All the best, and good luck!”
Prof. Eiji Masai: He is the corresponding author of papers where researchers attempt to sequence the TPA degradation and uptake genes of the Comamonas sp. Strain E6. He directed us to some bacteria that potentially degrade TPA on ATCC (bacillus species) and informed us how to obtain the Comamonas species that his lab deposited.
Sara Hamel Ph.D.: We obtained her contact information through one of our mentors, Bom Pichet Praveschotinunt, who said that she could help us with the printing and building of the MFC. Sara assisted in 3D printing the shells and the frames for our initial microbial fuel cell based on the design we provided from the Bielefeld iGem Team 2013. The printer used was MakerBot, located in Pierce Hall, part of Harvard's School John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences. She was also responsible for coordinating access to lab space on campus during the school year.

POSTCARDS
Raising synthetic biology awareness on 150 cm².
Distributing knowledge
When it comes to synthetic biology the public may be prejudiced. This is most presumably caused due to misconceptions. This year's iGEM team Düsseldorf from the HHU Düsseldorf felt called upon tackling this issue and motivate the people to overcome their skepticism. Thus the idea to create and distribute educational postcards in the context of synthetic biology emerged.
Gathering the creativity of all other German iGEM teams, topics ranging from the production of insulin to gene editing were covered. We exchanged packs of about 100 postcards with some of the other teams to be able to have a broader area to spread them . This led to receiving postcards from the teams from Aachen, Darmstadt, Duesseldorf, Hannover, Goettingen and Tuebingen. Our postcard was designed after the motto 'Tolerance for Transgenes'. By that we demanded for a higher level of tolerance for GMO's which in general are negatively connoted in Germany and pointed towards their advantages.
We would like to thank team Düsseldorf for letting us join their campaign. Hopefully, many will follow their example and engage in public communication!"

Welcome to the Team
Team Mom
Name: Astrid Honoré
Study: Biomedicine
Mail: ashon14@student.sdu.dk
Astrid enjoys an active lifestyle and loves to travel. However, this is a problem because as she puts it: “I have the time, but not the money to travel as much as I want”.  She likes iGEM for the experiments and the ping-pong discussions within the team. Lastly she is fond of baking but thinks that the best part of baking is when others enjoy it.
The Wiki Witch
Name: Birka Jensen
Study: Applied mathematics
Mail: bjens14@student.sdu.dk
Birka is a fire breathing, number crunching, keyboard typing, soccer playing, Wiki-coding mathematician. She lives with her dog, cat and her lovely wife to whom she got married this summer - The iGEM team was there! Birka's number one favorite activity is performing fireshows with Cirkus Sort .
The Clone Commander
Name: Brian Baltzar
Study: Biomedicine
Mail: brbal14@student.sdu.dk
Brian lives with his girlfriend and their three year old son. Brian hopes that he can someday make a significant contribution on the road to new treatments against antimicrobial resistance. He joined iGEM because he wanted to experience doing ‘real’ research - both the ups and the downs.
The Planner
Name: Cathrine Christensen
Study: Biomedicine
Mail: catch14@student.sdu.dk
Cathrine is a real planner and to challenge the unknown she chose to join the iGEM team this year. With her drive and ambition to gain new knowledge, she hopes to get a glimpse of what her future might bring.
Mr. Goldilocks
Name: Jakob Rønning
Study: Biology
Mail: jroen14@student.sdu.dk
Jakob has long hair and he likes to brush his hair whenever it is possible. The huge potential in gene manipulation inspired Jakob and gave him a desire to know more about synthetic biology through iGEM. After all, he loves to be in a field of science that has such a big potential to remodel our way of life.
Super Mario
Name: Joel Mario Vej-Nielsen
Study: Biomedicine
Mail: jovej14@student.sdu.dk
Joel is the man in colorful clothes and with a big grin on his face. He has a strong intuitive grasp of natural science, which made iGEM a good opportunity for him to gain practical lab experience and to test his abilities. As a kid he nicknamed himself “Super Joel”. However, as his middle name is Mario, soon his class would chant “Super Mario” whenever Joel was at the blackboard.
The Movie Star
Name: Mathilde Nygaard
Study: Medicine
Mail: manyg14@student.sdu.dk
Mathilde has lived most of her life in France and moved back to Denmark only three years ago. iGEM was the opportunity to try out the world of research. Her most fun experience in iGEM has been the many roadtrips. The group has always been cheering, joyful, and ready to sing along in the car.
The ICA Master
Name: Nete Bækgaard
Study: Chemical Engineering
Mail: nebae12@student.sdu.dk
Nete is the team's engineer and she therefore knows a thing or two about taking a project from the research state to the industrial scale. iGEM has taught Nete to be more patient because it can take a long time before you succeed with experiments. But when you do, it is the best feeling!
The Klutz
Name: Pernille Rasmussen
Study: Biomedicine
Mail: prasm14@student.sdu.dk
Pernille does her part in the laboratory by ensuring everybody gets a whole lot of experience, mostly because of Pernilles clumsiness, since things might have to be done twice. She chose to join iGEM for the great laboratory experience and to get a glimpse of how life might be after graduation.
Thinker Bell
Name: Rikke Bentzon
Study: Philosophy & Biology
Mail: rbent14@student.sdu.dk
Rikke is interested in bioethics, the epistemology of knowledge and philosophy of science. She joined iGEM so she could get the opportunity to work in a labcoat instead of sitting with her reading glasses. Rikke loves to read - at the moment she has more than 400 books in her apartment. Apart from that, she drinks more coffee than the rest of the iGEM team combined.
Twisty Professor
Name: Rune Øbo
Study: Biomedicine
Mail: ruubo14@student.sdu.dk
Rune is our second redhaired team member. He can always twist a scientific explanation so the receiver understands it. Rune is always full of energy when he's not hungry; if so, feed him a Snickers. He learned through iGEM that communication is an important skill. Also, he once biked 1 km to catch a Bulbasaur in Pokémon GO while a PCR was running.
PCR-King Of The World
Name: Viktor Mebus
Study: Biology
Mail: vimeb13@student.sdu.dk
Meet Viktor, a biologist who would seem to only know the nature of bird calls, so it was a great surprise when he showed his true value. For Viktor iGEM was a way to finally harvest the glory that he so truly deserved. “Heavy lies the crown” they say and Viktor has learned that being the king of PCR means that he is now obligated to do every last bit of every PCR reaction to the end of time.

Sponsors
We would like to give a special thanks to our sponsors, who financially supported throughout the project.
University of Southern Denmark has given us the funds for the project, which has made it possible for us to participate in iGEM. Here also a special thanks to the faculties at SDU for supporting our project and letting us use their different equipments in the laboratories.
Integrated DNA Technologies has provided us with 20 kbp worth of gBlock gene fragments.
Eurofins Genomics has provided us with half a mix2seq kit and 75 % discount on our sequencing.
LGC Biosearch Technologies has giving us a 30 % discount on their oligos.
Pentabase has giving us a sponsorship for purchase of oligos and a further 10 % discount.
SnapGene has provided us with free use of their program during the iGEM period.
Albani has provided us with t-shirts.
Merck has provided us with us with LB broth, taq polymerase and deoxynucleotides.
ZIGNS has helped design the wikipage layout and provided graphics.
The whole idea of our product Bacto-Aid as a bandage, was an idea we all contributed to. The lab work diverged into three groups: Plastic, Silk, and Bacteriocins. We wanted to take advantages of the many Biomedicines in our group and therefore each group had a biomedicin as squad leader.
The Plastic group was Birka Jensen, Jakob Rønning and squad leader Joel Vej-Nielsen. Birka helped in the lab until July where her focus switched to programming our wiki-site. Birka literally wrote everything from the bottom.
The Silk group consisted of Mathilde Nygaard, Nete Bækgaard, Viktor Mebus, Rikke Bentzon and squad leader Rune Øbo. We all tried really hard with the lab work, but we did not manage to produce silk fibers, unfortunately. Rikke switched her focus to the philosophic part of our project in august. Rikke is head writer on the  Studies on the Precautionary Principle ,  Theory and Bioethics  and Philosophy of science . 
The Bacteriocin group was Brian Baltzar, Astrid Honoré, Pernille Rasmussen and squad leader Cathrine Christensen. They all went crazy in the laboratory and got awesome results!
Beside the three main groups our project diverged into more branches including Funding, Clothes, Graphical design, Integrated human practice, Presentation etc. It was therefore necessary to assign people to different tasks. To sum-up, we all contributed to the project with our individual forces and thus made it a fantastic experience.

Adviser
Xiaopeng Gao
Hi, I am Xiaopeng Gao from Beijing Institute of Technology. As an advisor                                                 of BIT-China, I have given a lot of proposals to our program which is just                                                 like our baby. What’s more, I have devoted myself to this                                                 program and pinned great hope on it.
My major is biochemical engineering and the field of my research is                                                 metabolic engineering and synthetic biology,                                                 so iGEM is a rare chance for me to use my major strength to solve practical problems.
After year-long preparation, I have been head over                                                 heels in love with our program and harvested a lot. I really appreciate iGEM.
Beijia Han
My name is Beijia Han, I’m a master student in School of Life Science,                                                 Beijing Institute of Technology. My major is Biology and my research is                                                 focus on enzyme modification. Luckily, I join in the 2016 iGEM competition as                                                 an adviser in BIT-China, and there is a four-year history of our                                                 team (BIT-China) representing our school to attend this prestigious                                                 competition to show our research projects. This year our team project                                                 is mainly about population quality control. As an adviser, my mission                                                 is to help the undergraduate students to solve the problems in this                                                 research and give proper suggestions. It is a challenging task,                                                 but I love this feeling that we fight together.
Anqi Zhou
Hi. I’m Ariel, an enthusiastic and motivated student with great interest                                         in synthetic biology. I’m currently doing my master in Biochemical                                         Engineering. iGEM offers me an excellent opportunity to explore                                         mystery and fun of biology, and I really enjoy the process of                                         scientific research .The most amazing part of iGEM which attracts                                         me is to use knowledge and experience I have by doing the things                                         I love to create things that can make the world a better place.                                         Besides experiments, I have a real passion for traveling around the world and                                         tasting delicious food, because i believe either your body or soul must be on the way.
Liang Zhang
Hi, I am Liang Zhang and from Beijing Institute of Technology.                                                 As an advisor of BIT-China, I gave a lot of proposals to our program and our program is just                                                 like our baby.

After a yearlong preparation,                                                 I am head over heels in love with it and I harvested a lot. Thanks to iGEM.
Members
Qi Liu
I am Qi Liu majoring in bioengineering. This is my first time taking part in iGEM, and I gain a lot from the process of doing experiment, solving some problems, and I also learn a lot from my classmates. We work as team, helping each other not only doing experiments, But also giving some suggestions, for example, we have a regular meeting each week, we put forward our questions, and then professors and team members will give us some solutions. I am so happy to be a member of such team whenever you meet problems, there are also somebody willing to help you.
Jinpeng Wu
Hello.I’m Jinpeng Wu，a student of Yan’an University.I participated in the iGEM competition to get new experiences in the field of sythetic biology.because it is a very fascinating and exciting topic in my studies for me. During the iGEM project I have learned to designed several experiments and strengthened the skills of experiment. If there is a  chance , I will take part in iGEM again.
Zhuoxin Wang
Hi. It's my first year to be an iGEMer. I am so honor to join this team and gain a lot of precious experience in this project. To be honest, this is the most amazing summer that I ever have.
I am that kind of people who adore drawing and handcraft, because it can make me like an awesome person. If you also a big fan of drawing and handcraft, we can talk more about it.
Let us enjoin this giant jamboree.
Hui Luo
Hi~ I’m Hui Luo. This is my second year to attend IGEM competition. A lot of challenges and funny things come together to my life. I’m fascinated about science and technology. IGEM gives me a great opportunity to touch my dream science and have a unique experience to intensively work on a project with my lovely teammates.
Actually, I’d love to become a well-rounded person, which means I can not only understand the scientific books but also know how to arrange my daily life. I’m not good at these kinds of things, but I’m trying to make efforts.
Lianjie Ma
Hi, dear. I’m Lianjie Ma. It’s my first year for iGEM. I do hope we can be good friends.
I belong to very typical slow person, but that won’t be the blocks between you and me. If you are interested in Korean teleplay or losing weight (smile bitterly), come to find me at BIT-China.
I can hardly wait to see you in Boston!
Kang Ma
Kang is named by my father, which in Chinese, means never give up and stay positive.
This is my first year to be an IGEMer. Changing the DNA of bacterial and making them work for us is the coolest thing I have ever done.
In my spare time, I play ping-pong and basketball, I like songs of Birdy and Ed sheeran. But now, more than anything, I want to go home and have dinner with my families.
Lirong Zhao
I major in chemical industry. Loving science, loving nature, loving biology, loving international technology, and loving iGEM, these features combine into me.
In our team, I am a new member and responsible for experiment and wiki, also learn a lot through the whole process.
People can only see the outward gorgeousness but the inward rough. Chasing dream is doomed to be a lonely journey, there will always be challenge and ridicule throughout the way. Even covered with wounds and cuts, we still should live beautiful for our own. Be chillax, and be graceful, remember we finally speak for ourselves.
Hongyu Yang
Major in biological. I feel honored to participate in the iGEM. I’m freshman for iGEM, I’m so happy to be an iGEMer. I love rising to the challenge, IGEM is a challenge for me. But I believe I can do it very well. Success calls for hard work and perseverance. I believe I can grow up and become a strong person in the future.
Yan Tai
Hello everyone, my name is Yan Tai, who is the member of BIT-china. I come from Information and Electronic college and take charge of the management of alliance this year. Firstly, I so glad to get involved in the iGEM competition, this work gave me more deeply impression than itself, but in the communication with my team or the other team, which might have a big influence in my future. Besides, by this experience, I also made many new friends who were major on the different areas. They taught me a lot about my part, and I was so grateful of all the things.
Pengjing Hu
My grandmother has said: “You will change the world in the future, my dear grandson.” So today, I am here and join the iGEM 2016 in order to make my grandmother’s dream come true. Save the world and protect all the human beings!
My Chinese name is Hu Pengjing; also, you can call my English name Beaz. I come from China. I like biology and soccer. If you also have the same dream, I will be together with you!
Synthetic biology gives us a chance to create all kinds of fungus with different superpowers. I don’t have the superpowers but I can give it to bacteria. So I believe that my super bacteria will help the human being one day.
Pengcheng Zhang
Hello, everyone. I’m Pengcheng Zhang. It is my second year for IGEM. This year, as the leader of BIT-CHINA, I hope I can have a different experience. My major work are the wet and dry experiment.
IGEM is really a good chance to exercise ourselves, I do hope we could enjoy the special trip together. Also I want to do works more independently rather than just rely on team members like last year.
Jianfang Ren
Hello, everyone! I am Jianfang Ren, a junior student from Yan’an University and major in bioscience. I haven’t learned about iGEM at all. This is my first year for iGEM. I am not the origin member and I join this big family in July. I have learned a lot from this project, and spent a good time in Beijing this summer vacation. I’m an active and friendly girl. Hope be your friend in Boston.
Ziyin Zhang
Hey, buddies, look here, the story told by Ziyin Zhang is about begin, from the mysterious ancient oriental country, China. With biological engineering professional skills, I crossed thousands of miles to the iGEM in order to create new energy and protect the world. I carried what I have and what you want. What I wish to emphasize here is that my story has unique plots of ups and downs and the enthralling end. If we're lucky to meet each other, I think you'll like it.
Zeyan Li
你好, I am Zeyan Li, enchantée！Hablo chino, inglés, español y un poco de francés. Haha~ you can call me Hamster because friends said I am really a hamster when eating biscuits. Two years of involvement in BIT-China iGEM team makes me a “housekeeper”, not only developing the research project with experiments but also doing design work to show the public our team. In my free time, I enjoy seeking all kinds of new food experience, except drinks with sugar:( By the way, the protein my favorite is our Killer Group’s hokD!
Yiru Yang
I’m Yiru Yang. I’m an undergraduate student from Beijing Institute of Technology, and my major is biology engineering. In order to achieve some useful purposes, I think that designing and constructing biological machines with synthetic biology knowledge is really very important and amazing. So this year I take part in iGEM to realize this idea, as a team member of BIT-China. I gain a lot in this process, for example, I learned how to design and how to do experiment well.
In a word, I’m so happy and grateful to be an iGEMer!

Students from diverse backgrounds at the University of Alberta have come together to form the Ingenuity Lab Future Innovators iGEM team. We come from a broad range of scientific disciplines, such as biology, biochemistry, microbiology and chemical engineering. With a macroscopic view overlooking the picturesque River Valley in Edmonton AB, we are a team of scientists that is passionate about discovering the intricate folds and details that are found in the microscopic world.
The main focus of our project is on designing 3D DNA origami structures, which at the nanoscale, self assembles in a hierarchical order to form a scaffold for complex gold nanowire circuits. We plan on developing a new assembly standard that will allow nanocircuit construction. One of the applications we are exploring is attaching photosystem II protein purified from Synechocystis 6803 to the nanowire to generate a usable current and form a nanoscale battery.  Our DNA Origami nanocircuitry design can be adapted to more complex circuits for potential applications in various fields like health sciences. In other words, the DNA moulds gold nanoparticles to grow into the desired shape, pattern and complex components needed for programmable circuits.
Introducing the Ingenuity Team:
Dawson Zeng
Dawson Zeng recently graduated from University of Alberta with a double major in Biology and Chemistry. This is his second year competing in iGEM (Alberta 2013). He is strong believer in using multidisciplinary approaches to understand and standardize biology. His journey began from a Biohack guest lecture by Andrew Hessel on campus. Since then his fascination and curiosity spiralled out of control. He is always inspired by the calibre of projects iGEM teams produce each year. More importantly, he loves the spirit of the iGEM competition, as it is a unique opportunity to put everything into practice in an environment that promotes open science and collaborative effort. This time around, iGEM gives him the opportunity to experience and conquer the challenges of planning such a big project and the organization of a team. Best of luck to all of them this year!
 
Mirat Sojitra
Mirat Sojitra is from a small town Fort McMurray in northern Alberta and moved to Edmonton to attend the prestigious University of Alberta – to take up biochemistry. He became interested in synthetic biology after discovering it in his undergraduate studies. While exploring this area, he teamed up with students with similar interests to compete in the iGEM annual competition. During the research portion of the iGEM he learned that there are many obstacles to overcome but circumnavigating them and thinking about critical failure points is what was required for most efficient use of time. After iGEM he would like to explore and understand synthetic biology further in depth and hopefully create products that any person with minimal experience can use as part of a toolkit to create innovate. He is passionate about spending time in the Edmonton River Valley and hiking in the trails.
 
Patricia Yan
Patricia Yan is currently an undergraduate student pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Chemical Engineering at the University of Alberta. Stemming from her curiosity in science and research, she got involved in research in high school through volunteering with the Derda lab and entering the Sanofi Biogenius Competition. She enjoys the entire research process from brainstorming ideas to designing and carrying out protocols to problem solving at all stages of a project. iGEM is a project that she got involved in since it combines both engineering and science students into a well-rounded and hardworking team to tackle a large scale project. Working on the iGEM project has taught her the lesson of keeping your chin up but your head level; in essence, there is no point in being overly pessimistic or optimistic about if experiments work, but rather what is most important is to do your best throughout and learning from mistakes but having the motivation to keep on at it. During her spare time, Patricia loves to hike and bake. She hopes to be part of the development of greener energy solutions in the future.
 
Reshma Sirajee
Reshma Sirajee is a second year undergraduate student at the University of Alberta majoring in Biological Sciences. She found a love for research early in her high school years while working on her Edmonton Regional Science Fair Project at the robust UofA research facilities. During her time at the lab, Reshma enjoyed all aspects of the iGEM project from utilising creative approaches to conducting experiments to troubleshooting, and – finally - producing promising results after endless modifications. iGEM’s essence of combining leadership, collaborative problem solving and research together left a rewarding imprint on Reshma. In the future, Reshma looks forward to exploring ways to improve healthcare accessibility and drug delivery, as she is passionate about medical research and interdisciplinary education in STEM. During her spare time, Reshma enjoys playing soccer, exploring the seasonal festivals of the city and navigating through the trails of River Valley.
 
Nafaa Haddou
Nafaa Haddou is a recent undergraduate in Molecular Biology. Originally from Calgary AB, he moved up to Edmonton about 5 years ago to pursue his studies. All in all, he has found being in this city quite a change from southern Alberta, but has definitely made a home here. Joining the IGEM team was an exciting step that came about after a hearty discussion and brainstorm with his friend and colleague Dawson. The main aspect that drew Nafaa in was the potential to address real world issues and do something novel that normally be attempted easily. So far, Nafaa has found IGEM intriguing and definitely a fun mental challenge when it comes to finding solutions using an interdisciplinary approach. One thing that he has learned and continued to apply is the need to critically analyze and meticulously approach problems while thinking through the effects down the experimental line. This is one of the skills Nafaa hopes to cultivate as he continues his education in materials engineering. Outside the lab Nafaa loves to take it easy and relax around good people. A perfect evening for him is hitting the outdoors, having a BBQ, and enjoying the company of friends! Nafaa tries to enjoy these moments whenever the chance is presented between commitments to local youth development groups and entrepreneurship programs.
 
Matthew Fung
Matthew Fung is a fourth year student majoring in biochemistry at the University of Alberta. Hailing from the city of Edmonton, he was introduced to IGEM in his high school career and it followed closely in his undergraduate education. Following Richard Feynman’s famous quote, “What I cannot create, I do not understand”, he and a handful of his peers eventually cofounded the University of Alberta iGEM team. After graduating, he plans on pursuing his passion in biotechnology or medical school. Working in IGEM has taught him valuable project management skills as well as reaffirming his love for research. In his spare time, Matthew enjoys jamming out on his sax and taking long walks on the beach. Barefoot."

Megan Satyadi | Junior | Microbiology, Immunology, and Molecular Genetics
I am a junior in MIMG and am returning for a third year as a research advisor and Director of Training. Additionally, I am also an undergraduate research associate in the Kosuri Lab at UCLA studying GPCR-ligand interactions and developing a multiplex assay to deorphanize the entirety of the human and mouse olfactory receptor repertoire. I believe synthetic biology holds infinite power and potential to revolutionize science, and is the perfect outlet for innovative scientific minds. Long term, I plan on pursuing a MD and entering the field of gastroenterological surgery. When I'm not stuck working in a TC hood, I'm an avid reader and enjoy working with animals.
Alan Chen | Junior | Neuroscience
​I am a junior undergraduate just joining iGEM this year and am currently majoring in Neuroscience at UCLA. I have always been interested in synthetic biology and find it fascinating to reprogram existing biological systems. Currently I am working with a group to create a bacterial toxin delivery system.
Amy Guo | Sophomore | Bioengineering
I am currently a sophomore bioengineering student. My interests include botany, particularly plant-herbivore interactions and plant-to-plant communication pathways, and diatoms. Synthetic biology I feel is best described as a pair of much-needed, high-prescription glasses-- your perception of the world around you becomes wonderfully magnified and crisp, and suddenly you are able to view the mechanics of living organisms as an infinite library of blueprints at your disposal.
Omar Ebrahim | Sophomore | Biochemistry
Innovation has never been the product of book smarts alone. For an idea to bear fruit, I believe one has to tinker with it. Unfortunately, much of a biologist's education consists of almost exclusively memorization and recitation of facts. However, synthetic biology is somewhat of an anomaly because it embodies the practice of picking something apart and manipulating it's core components as its standard methodology. I guess that's why I am here.
Andrew Liu | Junior | Biochemistry
I am a 3rd year biochemistry major here at UCLA, and it is my first year on the iGEM team. I love everything science and so the interdisciplinary and undergraduate guided research in iGEM is an incredibly enjoyable experience for me!
Scott Taylor | Junior | Microbiology, Immunology, and Molecular Genetics
As a junior in the MIMG Department (for now), I’m am a new addition to the iGEM team. My previous lab experience has been working on data analysis and correlation of production of certain yeast metabolites. In the coming year, I am eager to explore synthetic biology, which I sees as a very open frontier for interesting, novel ideas to be explored. As for my long term goals, it’s all up in the air.
Amy Pai | Sophomore | Neuroscience
Initially, I was pleasantly surprised that there would be a research team genuinely valuing input from first-years like me. UCLA iGEM not only offers the platform for individual voice in developing a project, but also opens the door to many aspects of research dynamics. Syn bio wields massive potentials for creative minds, and it’s remarkable that we get to explore the field this way.
Nithin Dharmaraj | Junior | Bioengineering
I am a junior study bioengineering. I enjoy the creativity and autonomy that iGEM provides and also cherish the opportunity to work with some of the brightest minds at my university. Though most of my transformations rarely work, I still marvel at the power of synthetic biology when in the off chance I do see colonies on my plate. With this same excitement, I hope to pursue a profession in advancing the field of healthcare in the future.
Yashes Srinivasan | Sophomore | Bioengineering
Passionate about science and innovation, I am excited to be part of UCLA iGEM. The program offers more than just a research experience. It encourages independence and creativity and allows students to explore unique interests alongside a dynamic and driven group of individuals. The interdisciplinary nature of synthetic biology provides several opportunities as well as exposure to many different fields of science.
Jared Lamar | Junior | Physics
​I am a junior undergraduate majoring in Physics at UCLA. This is my second year on the team. What I'm most drawn to about iGEM and synthetic biology is the sheer number of possibilities there are in terms of the directions our research can take. It really feels like the sky is the limit as to what we can make these little microbes do."

Rachel
Will
Marisa
Jeffrey is a rising junior studying biomedical engineering. He was first turned on to the idea of participating with the iGEM team when he started working in Wilson Wong’s lab under Ben Weinberg this past January. He has nothing but extreme thanks for the opportunity they have given him to grow as a scientist. Jeffrey intends to go on to graduate school doing a PhD in epidemiology and infectious disease. His dream is to work with the CDC or WHO doing work in the field of tropical diseases, and ultimately take his experiences and teach a new generation of scientists. In his spare time, Jeffrey is an avid musician performing at bars and restaurants in both Boston as well as back in Westchester, NY. A fun fact about Jeffrey is that he has a twin brother, Jason, and he is an avid collector of art.
Kami is a senior studying biomedical engineering. She has worked in the Tissue Microfabrication Laboratory under Prof. Chris Chen since her sophomore year and decided to join the iGEM team to gain some insight into how synthetic biology could play an important role in the field of tissue engineering. She aspires to a career in medicine and hopes to contribute to the fight against cancer. In her spare time, Kami enjoys chasing after balls on the volleyball and tennis courts and painting masterpieces on canvas. When the sun is out, you’ll find her hiking or quadding through the trails of Vermont, and overall just enjoying the tranquility of nature. A fun fact about Kami is that she does not have an appendix.
Rachel Petherbridge is a sophomore studying biomedical engineering. She became interested in iGEM after spending a summer working with the CRISPR/dCas9 system in the Khalil Lab in high school. This interest grew when she took a position as an undergraduate research assistant in the same lab this past January Rachel plans to pursue a PhD/MD to become a medical researcher and practitioner, and eventually, a teacher. In her spare time, you can find Rachel in the FitRec center either taking a dance class or working out to stay in shape, involved with the BU Model United Nation events, or hanging out with Arrows-U, the undergraduate WISE club on campus, where she is Vice President. A fun fact about Rachel is that she is a dual citizen of both the US and UK, which explains her penchant for tea and Marmite on toast for breakfast each morning.
Will is a rising junior studying biomedical engineering. He participated in iGEM in order to learn how research is conducted and gain the ability to perform useful lab techniques. Will hopes to continue on to grad school, pursue a PhD, and someday work in the field of DNA technology. He is highly interested in the field of synthetic biology both for its potential to solve real world problems and for its ""design and build"" nature. Outside of the lab, Will also has a strong interest creative writing, and he enjoys writing stories as a hobby. Fun fact: Will plays the electric violin.
Marisa Mendes is a junior studying biomedical engineering. She joined iGEM because she wanted to gain experience working in a lab to help her decide if she wants to pursue a research-oriented career path. As a child, she remembers looking at her hands and wondering what hands were made of and what allowed them to perform simple day-to-day tasks. She knew biomedical engineering was a subject she needed to pursue when she saw a brief news report that cardiac tissue had been synthesized in a lab and was able to pulse like a human heart. Now, she wants to mass-produce synthetic tissues to replace malfunctioning ones. When she is not playing the role of a student researcher, you can find Marisa in a theatre designing lights for her next theatre production. Fun fact: The first time Marisa traveled away from her home in Southern California was for her freshman orientation at BU.

The NEPTUNE Flow
Neptune abstracts a very intricate workflow to provide an intuitive experience for its user. Below is a detailed depiction of all of the components that are under Neptune's hood.
Each of BostonU Hardware Team's members played an integral part in the success of Neptune's development.
Liquid Flow Relations & User Constraints File | Shane McCormack
In order to increase accessibility of our tool (and microfluidics in general), a method for describing microfluidics in a few simple lines was formed! This standard consists of Liquid Flow Relations (or LFR), and the User Constraints File (or UCF). The LFR file is where the user describes the inputs, outputs, and tells of any operations which occur on those inputs and outputs. These operations are described as symbols on the LFR, but are informed by the UCF. The few lines of LFR are the only things needed to run a chip through Neptune; a sample UCF is provided with Neptune that can be fine-tuned, but will not need to be written in its entirety.
The UCF can be thought of as a library of microfluidic components where, once a component is defined, it will never have to be written again! In more detail, once a component is defined inside the UCF, all subsequent LFR files can utilize the symbol the component is linked to without redefining the details of the component. The UCF leverages the MINT standard of describing parametric microfluidics. This parametrization unlocks great potential in the rapid prototyping of designs, where one number can be changed in the UCF, and all subsequent designs will have the updated component! For example, if our fictional synthetic biologist Dr. Ali found that his mixer's bends were too short in length, with one number edit in the UCF he could fix every bend of every mixer in all of his designs thereafter! This is far more accessible than redrawing every bend by hand on AutoCAD.
μShroom Mapper | Shane McCormack
With the new facilitated design method of Liquid Flow Relations, a behind-the-scenes software tool was needed to interpret and translate the LFR and UCF into a functional MINT file. This task is fulfilled with muShroomMapper; muShroomMapper takes LFR and UCF as inputs, maps the LFR into a graph with the support of NetSynth, then informs that graph with the UCF. The informed graph is then translated into a MINT file, to be placed and routed to a blueprint for fabrication.
μShroom Mapper-Neptune Integration | Kestas Subacius & Shane McCormack
Liquid Flow Relation files and User Constraint Files greatly simplify the microfluidic design process. With the implementation of the LFR and UCF file types also came the development of uShroom Mapper, an algorithm that takes LFR and UCF file inputs and converts them into MINT file types. These file types and tools by themselves are incredibly useful, enabling researchers to specify more complex designs with greater ease. Unfortunately, alone these tools would be cumbersome and difficult to use for an inexperienced programmer.
Therefore we integrated the LFR and UCF file types into Neptune, and we integrated the uShroom Mapper algorithm into Neptune's backend libraries. To make these tools easy to use, we developed a sleek, simple and appealing user interface where LFR and UCF files can be edited and then sent to uShroom mapper for conversion to MINT. We also integrated a front end terminal that provides compilation feedback and throws errors when design rules are violated. All this to speak, we integrated uShroom Mapper with Neptune by sculpting a clean user interface that makes the design simple and efficient.
Fluigi-Neptune Integration | Kestas Subacius & Shane McCormack
After uShroom Mapper outputs a MINT specification of a microfluidic chip, designers can modify this file type to do fine-tuning and optimization of their design. A microfluidic designer can also opt to skip specification at the LFR level, and they can go right into designing a MINT file. This being said, MINT files are not the end of the pipeline, and this filetype must be converted to a microfluidic design schematic that can be used for fabrication.
Fluigi is a powerful algorithm that takes a MINT description of a microfluidic chip, and from this description it outputs a microfluidic chip design. This tool is analogous to a place and route tool for a circuit schematic, allowing for complicated designs to be specified and then realized. Fluigi takes in a MINT specification, and outputs design schematics in the form of SVG’s for CNC mill fabrication, and EPS files for photolithography.
We integrated the MINT file type, along with the Fluigi compiler into Neptune. As a standalone tool Fluigi can be pretty daunting to navigate, requiring shell scripting experience and a solid software background. We eliminated all difficulty from Fluigi by integrating Neptune as a user interface for Fluigi. Users can compile their MINT files through Neptune, and Fluigi will in turn provide the designer feedback in a console. Design errors and design status is all fed back to Neptune. All in all, we integrated Fluigi with Neptune, providing a robust and easy to use UI for editing and compiling MINT files.
Choosing Mechanical System | Zach Lasiuk
Analyzed the pitfalls and advantages of both the rack and pinion system as well as the piston rod system. In order to properly choose a system for Neptune, the overall goals of Neptune were called to mind: Low cost, easy to use, and modular. With these design goals in mind, the piston rod system was ultimately chosen to ensure accuracy, modularity, and the ability to dispense very small to very large amounts of liquid with a feedback control active.
Designing Electrical System | Zach Lasiuk
Focusing in on the overall goals of Neptune’s hardware (low cost, easy to use, and modular), the Arduino Mega was chosen to control Neptune’s hardware. Because Neptune is inherently modular to change with synthetic biologists needs, Neptune’s electronic control circuitry must be equally as modular and scalable. The electronic system is comprised of power inputs, stackable Arduino motor controller shields, an Arduino Mega, and various headers and capacitors to make the system respond appropriately.
Mapping Mechanical Motion & Constant Flow Rate Equation | Zach Lasiuk
In order to accurately control Neptune’s hardware, the mechanical motion of the servo and syringe paring must be completely defined. Therefore, the equation for off-center piston-rod motion was derived. An inherent characteristic of the piston rod mechanical system is a non-linear response from the syringe pump being controlled. Based on where the servo arm is in its circular path of motion, the syringe pump will move different amounts with the same change in theta of the servo arm. This problem was overcome by developing an algorithm to ensure a constant flow rate is always achieved with Neptune given the specific values of the active servo and syringe, involving two lookup tables and linear extrapolation.
Modular Baseboard Implementation | Zach Lasiuk
The challenge of Neptune’s baseboard is to utilize a desktop CNC mill to achieve the functionality of a full machine shop. More specifically, Neptune’s baseboard must retain system expandability to arbitrary dimensions and maintain ease of use by providing places to auto-align components. This is done using an emerging standard in microfluidic hardware, the MEC board, developed by the GroverLab at University of California, Riverside. By creating these modular MEC squares that can be milled out one at a time and connected together. Neptune’s board can use a multitude of materials and even a combination of materials, currently tested with HDPE plastic, ABS plastic, and wood.
Created Parametric 3D Parts | Zach Lasiuk & Priya Kapadia
To ensure Neptune meets the requirements of any microfluidic experiment with different requirements for flow-rate and max volume to be dispensed, Neptune has completely parametric 3D parts. These parts hold and align the servo and syringe combination and enable the fluid motion of both. From 100mL to 10uL, Neptune’s 3D printed hardware will adjust in shape to accommodate different size syringes and servos to meet synthetic biologist’s experimental needs. While Neptune has tested servos and syringes on file to choose from by default, should a biologist need more volume to dispense or more precision in flow-rates they can input their own servo or syringe to obtain the exact response they desire. The final result is completely parametric 3D parts that adapt to a specific servo or syringe’s dimensions, enabling a massive amount of freedom for synthetic biologists in using Neptune.
Developed System Firmware | Zach Lasiuk
Reliability and repeatability of experiments are essential for Neptune to deliver results. The firmware developed for the Arduino Mega ensures these standards are met and maintained. Currently implemented, this firmware has the capability to work with both digital and analog servos, up to 13 servo shields stacked on top of the Arduino Mega (enabling the control of over 200 servos at once), control valves with instant motion, and control dispensers with variable flow-rates. In addition to working seamlessly with Neptune’s control page, there is another option to use the Arduino IDE should the need arise, retaining the ability to control both valves and dispensers.
Neptune's Specify Page | Kestas Subacius
Neptune’s “Specify” page is an integrated development environment for microfluidic chips designed through LFR. The “Specify” page was designed to encompass all parts of microfluidic design specification using LFR and UCF files, and this page is integrated with the uShroom mapper tool to convert designs to a MINT elaboration. In this IDE, users can define a microfluidic chip with specific inputs, outputs, and functionality. Designers can also define microfluidic chip parameters such as gradient generators, serpentine mixers and cell traps here. The Specify IDE provides a terminal for interfacing with uShroom mapper, and an editor for writing and editing files. This editor also provides syntax highlighting for LFR and UCF files, and error checking for improperly created files. Also, the Specify IDE has a user interface element for creating new microfluidic operators, making it very easy for designers to add new parts to their chip.
Neptune's Design Page | Kestas Subacius
Neptunes “Design” page is an integrated development environment for microfluidic chips designed through MINT. The “Design” page was created to encompass all the subtleties of elaborating a microfluidic chip using MINT files and configuration files. In this IDE, users can edit the fine aspects of their chip. A developer in this IDE has control over the sizing of each channel, port, valve and primitive in their design. Here users can also modify parameters related to how Fluigi compiles and outputs a design schematic. Parameters like chip dimensions are also defined in this section. The “Design” page also provides a visual preview the microfluidic design generated, allowing designers to see their chip layout as they modify their device. Design schematics generated on the “Design” page are immediately integrated with the build, assembly, and control sections of Neptune, allowing for clean navigation through the workflow.
Neptune's Workspaces | Kestas Subacius
Neptune was designed to be a easy-to-use desktop application. To this end, a file system had to be developed for Neptune that would allow for designers to store their designs locally on their computer, and to modify these designs through Neptune. Neptune was implemented like many other IDE’s, where designers can select workspaces on their computer, and any modifications they make to their designs happen locally. More importantly, these workspaces and this filesystem was implemented such that it will be expanded for cloud services in the future.
Neptune's Build & Assembly Pages | Priya Kapadia
After the user has designed the microfluidic chip, they can then move on to select hardware components to match their needs. They would need to first input the volume of liquid they would like to dispense, and the precision they require. Neptune would then search through its database of servos and syringes to recommend hardware combinations to the user based on complex calculations involving torque, the range of pulse-width modulations, the bandwidth-delay product, and so on. Consequently, users are provided with a large personalized list of items that they can choose from. The user can then map the hardware to the dispensers on the chip that they just designed. The mapping allows Neptune to calibrate the dispensers for the experiment. The user is then provided with an ordering list consisting of all the parts that they need for the experiment. The ordering list would include the new hardware that the user has just selected, some predetermined items such as a roll of 3D printing support, and also some variable items like the number of 6-32 screws for instance. These would be calculated using the user's choices and the chip at hand.
To ease the usage and to help the user put all the pieces together, Neptune's Assembly Page takes the user through a step by step process where they can make and connect all the pieces required to control the microfluidic device. Currently, the users can download all the file required to 3D print the infrastructure of the hardware we suggest to them in the Build page. However, moving forward, both the Build and Assembly page would allow for the user to input their own servo and syringe combination into Neptune. The ability for the user to create custom 3D printing files are currently in development. Aside from that, the Assembly page includes descriptions on how to create the infrastructure, mill out the microfluidic chip, connect the Arduino to the hardware, and set up the system for control.
Neptune's Control Page | Becca Wolf
Once users have milled out their microfluidic chip and assembled the supporting control infrastructure, he or she can control the valves and dispensers of their device through Neptune’s Control user interface. This interface displays a visual of their chip with controls to open or close valves, set a dispense rate for any given dispenser, or increment the dispensed liquid volume one unit of resolution at a time with only the click of a button. Through this page, a user may change the preset specs of each servo-syringe combination if he or she decides to change their setup. The control feature may be used to control any device using hardware formatted for use in Neptune regardless of the current project being designed to enable quick control adaption to different project environments. It is also through the control page that the user will establish connection to the arduino so that commands may be sent to pumps to operate valves and dispensers.
3DuF Integration | Becca Wolf
3DuF is a microfluidic design CAD tool which is part of a project led by Josh Lippai (see mentor section below for further details). We decided to leverage the JSON visualization features which 3DuF has to offer in Neptune to display a visual of the user’s chip for intuitive interaction with valves and dispensers on their microfluidic device in Neptune’s Control user interface. 3DuF is integrated into Neptune’s front end operation to this end. 3DuF’s version upkeep within Neptune is designed to handle the primitive features which are used in chip design bu Fluigi (see mentor section below) outputs.
Neptune-Arduino Integration | Johan Ospina & Becca Wolf
Neptune can be used to operate the valves and dispensers of a microfluidic chip through an Arduino Mega. In order to be able to send commands to the arduino to be interpreted and acted upon by firmware, Neptune opens a serial communication connection with the port the arduino is connected to. This is done quite simply by the user through the Control page and is as simple as selecting the port and pushing the “Connect” button. Neptune will then send commands specified by the user in the Control page to the arduino through UART.
Firmware-Neptune Integration | Zach Lasiuk & Becca Wolf
The way in which Neptune communicates to the Arduino Mega which powers the control of the microfluidic chip is standardized throughout the Neptune UI-firmware interaction. Commands are sent to the arduino through the Neptune Control page in the form of an 8-digit code where the first 4 digits indicate the index of the pin on the arduino which the servo-syringe combination is connected to, and the last 4 digits indicate a PWM value which indicates the position which the servo should rotate to.
Even Fluid Dispension-Neptune Integration | Zach Lasiuk & Becca Wolf
Integrated conversion of a set volume to dispense over time for dispensers in Neptune’s microfluidic devices are integrated into Neptune’s Software. A table of PWM and uL values at even intervals of fluid dispensing are generated and stored for each servo-syringe combination within Neptune to be used by the front end of the system to send dispense commands to the arduino. This can be done by the user through the Control page in an intuitive, pictorial way.
Neptune Packaging | Priya Kapadia
After creating Neptune as a web-application, the hardware team thought of packaging the entire application into a desktop application that the biologist could download onto his local computer. This would enable the user to use Neptune offline, making it more convenient. To do so, a packaging tool called Electron was introduced to host Neptune. This is under development, and moving forward, Neptune may become a desktop application that biologists can use anywhere and anytime.
Microfluidic Chip Prototyping | Shane McCormack
In order to ensure our design, build, and control workflow was functioning properly, we took designs through the Neptune workflow and tested them with mock experiments using colored water, or by collaborating with other iGEM teams to test biology inside our accessible microfluidic platform (checkout our collaborations page for more details on biology inside our systems!)
We stand on the shoulders of giants.
Our work would not have been possible without the foundations laid by our mentors. Neptune’s microfluidic design and fabrication tool leverages projects such as Fluigi Place and Route, Mint description language, MakerFluidics, and 3DuF in order to provide the most intuitive and cohesive experience for users. These projects have been built and expanded on by our graduate student mentors. We would like to thank our mentors for all of the work they have done to allow us to bring Neptune to life.
Fluigi | Radhakrishna Sanka
A place and route tool for microfluidic devices. Fluigi takes a MINT file as input and strategically routes the features specified in the MINT into an optimized microfluidic design. Fluigi outputs the design in a series of visual formats: SVG files (which can be used to mill out the different layers of the microfluidic chip using a CNC mill), a JSON file (which can be used to visualize the microfluidic design with 3DuF), and EPS files (which can be used to build the chip using photolithography if the user so chooses).
MINT | Radhakrishna Sanka
A microfluidic description language generated as an output of MuShroom mapper and used as an input to Fluigi. This language is used to describe the features of the specified microfluidic device in great detail including specification of feature shape, size and spacing.
Netsynth | Prashant Vaidyanathan
Netsynth is a software tool that was originally built by Prashant Vaidyanathan to translate Verilog logic descriptions into wire and gate lists. Netsynth has been modified for use in Neptune through a collaboration between Shane McCormack (BostonU_HW Team member) and Vaidyanathan to produce output formatted for interpretation in the context of microfluidic design. MuShroom mapper (a tool build by McCormack) uses this output alongside a variety of other inputs to produce a MINT file output in the Specify stage of Neptune.
3DuF | Joshua Lippai
A CAD-like drawing web application. 3DuF can be used to manually draw a microfluidic design if the user wishes to bypass high-level specifications. 3DuF will then output SVG files (for CNC milling layers of the microfluidic chip) and a JSON file for later visualization and editing purposes. When used in the context of Neptune, 3DuF is leveraged to visualize the JSON output of Fluigi so that the user may control his or her microfluidic device intuitively through the Neptune interface.
MakerFluidics | Ryan Silva
MakerFluidics is an accessible, inexpensive microfluidic fabrication technique used to manufacture microfluidic chips. A user will use an SVG file to mill out both the control and flow layers of a microfluidic chip. Then he or she will use these 2 layers to sandwich a piece of PDMS and vacuum the chip to create a seal. Through Neptune, the user is encouraged to use this fabrication infrastructure to make their chip so that they may rapidly prototype many chips inexpensively for any iterations of their experiment and easily control their microfluidic system through the Neptune interface.
Microfluidic Application | Ali Lashkaripour
Explorations into the biological applications for Neptune’s workflow are spearheaded by Ali Lashkaripour. He designs and tests features to be added to our UCF repo as relevant primitives to chip designs for synthetic biological application. Design constraints of microfluidic design through Neptune’s toolchain are also investigated by Lashkaripour.

Jeffrey is a junior studying biomedical engineering. He was first turned on to the idea of participating with the iGEM team when he started working in Wilson Wong’s lab under the mentorship of Ben Weinberg in January 2016. He has nothing but extreme gratitude for the opportunity they have given him to grow as a scientist. Jeffrey intends to go on to graduate school doing a PhD in epidemiology and infectious diseases. His dream is to work with the CDC or WHO doing work in the field of tropical diseases, and ultimately take his experiences and teach a new generation of scientists. In his spare time, Jeffrey is an avid musician performing at bars and restaurants in both Boston as well as back in Westchester, NY. A fun fact about Jeffrey is that he has a twin brother, Jason, and he is an avid collector of art. Jeffrey's work with the iGEM team focused on the development of the genetic logic circuit used in our work as well as the writing you see on this wiki and co-authoring the bioethics forums.  In addition, he, along with the rest of the team, worked on the cloning that built the Gemini Library.
Kami is a senior studying biomedical engineering. She has worked in the Tissue Microfabrication Laboratory under Prof. Chris Chen since her sophomore year and decided to join the iGEM team to gain some insight into how synthetic biology could play an important role in the field of tissue engineering. She aspires to a career in medicine. In her spare time, Kami enjoys chasing after balls on the volleyball and tennis courts and painting masterpieces on canvas. When the sun is out, you’ll find her hiking or quadding through the trails of Vermont, and overall just enjoying the tranquility of nature. A fun fact about Kami is that she does not have an appendix. Kami's work with the iGEM team focused on mammalian cell culture for transfections, data analysis, and the design of the images and figures used by BostonU. In addition, she, along with the rest of the team, worked on the cloning that built the Gemini Library.
Rachel Petherbridge is a sophomore studying biomedical engineering. She became interested in iGEM after spending a summer working with the CRISPR/dCas9 system in the Khalil Lab in high school. This interest grew when she took a position as an undergraduate research assistant in the same lab this past January Rachel plans to pursue a PhD/MD to become a medical researcher and practitioner, and eventually, a teacher. In her spare time, you can find Rachel in the FitRec center either taking a dance class or working out to stay in shape, involved with the BU Model United Nation events, or hanging out with Arrows-U, the undergraduate WISE club on campus, where she is Vice President. A fun fact about Rachel is that she is a dual citizen of both the US and UK, which explains her penchant for tea and Marmite on toast for breakfast each morning. Rachel's work with the iGEM team focused on the plasmid designs of the Gemini Library and data analysis. She is the co-author of our blog, ""Who Owns What,"" and our bioethics forums. In addition, she, along with the rest of the team, worked on the cloning that built the Gemini Library.
Will is a junior studying biomedical engineering. He participated in iGEM in order to learn how research is conducted and gain the ability to perform useful lab techniques. Will hopes to continue on to grad school, pursue a PhD, and someday work in the field of DNA technology. He is highly interested in the field of synthetic biology both for its potential to solve real world problems and for its ""design and build"" nature. Outside of the lab, Will also has a strong interest in creative writing, and he enjoys writing stories as a hobby. Fun fact: Will plays the electric violin. Will's work with the iGEM team focused on the development of the wiki. In addition, he, along with the rest of the team, worked on the cloning that built the Gemini Library.
Marisa Mendes is a junior studying biomedical engineering. She joined iGEM because she wanted to gain experience working in a lab to help her decide if she wants to pursue a research-oriented career path. As a child, she remembers looking at her hands and wondering what hands were made of and what allowed them to perform simple day-to-day tasks. She knew biomedical engineering was a subject she needed to pursue when she saw a brief news report that cardiac tissue had been synthesized in a lab and was able to pulse like a human heart. Now, she wants to mass-produce synthetic tissues to replace malfunctioning ones. When she is not playing the role of a student researcher, you can find Marisa in a theatre designing lights for her next production. Fun fact: the first time Marisa traveled away from her home in Southern California was for her freshman orientation at BU. Marisa's work with the iGEM team focused on our outreach projects, including coordinating with the Living Computing Project, and editing all written work, scientific or otherwise. In addition, she, along with the rest of the team, worked on the cloning that built the Gemini Library.

He is Huang Po Ying and he is from Taipei. He is majoring in the department of Molecular Biology and Human Genetics at Tzu Chi University. Biology has always been his favourite subject. After attending university, he got to know more friends with the same common interest through this iGem competition. An in conjunction with this team competition, he also improved on his teamwork and leadership abilities. He also loves to make friends and to explore the world. He is looking forward to the jamboree later this month in Boston , hoping to meet and to exchange knowledge regarding their products.
He is Chou Yu-Chen, was born in Taipei, Taiwan. Now he is studying in Tzu Chi University and majoring in molecular biology and human genetics. He also was the founder of the team 2016 TCU_Taiwan. Although he knows it was difficult to finish their team project, but he still believes unity is strength and TCU_Taiwan will break through any predicament to achieve their goal.
She is Wei-Yun Huang, and is studying in Tzu Chi University and majoring in Molecular Biology and Human Genetics as a sophomore this semester. She loves to do the experiments, whether the results are good or not, the process of the experiments can always let her enjoying in. So as a fellow of our team, TCU_Taiwan, to participate in IGEM 2016, it's so wonderful for her to design all the experimentds with her teammates and make our idea comes true.
He is Anthony Avellino.Was born in Jakarta, Indonesia. 27 October 1997. Molecular Biology and Human Genetic is what I'm studying now as undergraduate student. my dream is to get the Nobel prize, although it's require Big sacrifices, but I believe if we believe in our self then everything is possible. having known iGEM is a big  competition for the young scientist, I challenged myself grab this chance as the first step into my Nobel prize.
He is Chung Han-Ju, also called Hank, studying in Tzu Chi University and majoring in molecular biology and human genetics. His favorite motto is “Life is a great big canvas, and you should throw all the paint on it you can.” Thus, he joined the iGEM2016 to make his life more colorful.
Administrate Team
She is Matsunaga Yoi , studying in Tzu Chi University and majoring in molecular biology and human genetics. She thinks that learning from foreign culture can widen her views so she is in Taiwanese college now. Through this opportunity to participate in iGem2016 , she firmly believes that this experience can inspire her a lot.
Human Practice
Simon is just a crazy kid. However he can easily get emotional, a minute he can be very happy and the complete opposite the next. He loves to talk a lot and that’s why he is always taking on the role of the emcee for various activities. He loves sports a lot but he also loves eating. Despite exercising a lot, he’s still a chubby little fat kid. He claims that he will make the transformation by 2017. Just have to wait and see.
WIKI & MODEL Team
She is Chen I yu ,also called Eileen.She was born in Tainan,Taiwan.She is studying in Tzu Chi University and majoring in medical informatic. Her dream is to be a great engineer in the future.Her dream is to try anything she never do. She hope she can learn more in igem2016.
She is Vivian, she major in medical Informatics. Designing our wiki page with teammates is my part. Listening to music and drawing brings me lots of joy. It is really appreciated that she has got a chance to join a team for IGEM. It gave her an opportunity to learn more things about coding, and how to communicate with my teammates and leader.
He is Hsu Chih-Kai,He is responsible for wiki page in the IGEM team. In this team, He also learned that communication is the most important things for a team, Because when he write Wiki’s code, he can not write for himself without communicate for all the team members.

We've come a long way and it's time to give credit where it's due.
Establishing Our Team And Providing General Support
Emory Biotech, as both a club and an iGEM team, was pioneered by Rohita, Jasmine, and Josh. Without their perseverance and interest, we would not have the pleasure of being here today. Dr. Matsumura helped us brainstorm ideas, develop an experimental design and protocol for our project, and generously provided us with his lab space and guidance with challenging lab techniques. Maruf helped us satisfy all iGEM deadlines and requirements, and also helped mediate a collaboration between Emory Biotech and GSU's iGEM Team.
Fundraising Support And Advice
Sujith garnered the support of Emory's biology and chemistry departments to help found our research and travel for the iGEM competition.
Lab Support & Instruction
Cyrillus,Jasmine, and Sujith were hard at work gathering the data for our project. Cyrillus created two clones and Jasmine created one clone. This was all done with the guidance and supervision of Dr. Matsumura.
Human Practices and Outreach Support
Mone and Kathy interviewed several professors throughout the Emory community to explore the bioethics surrounding our research. We would like to thank the following individuals for contributing to our discussion: Professor Nicole Morris from the Emory School of Law.

TOULOUSE TEAM
The 2016 Toulouse team is composed of students from INSA Toulouse and Paul Sabatier University, as well as several teachers from these two institutions. This diversity        allows us to widen the set of skills and to bring a strong dynamic to complete the project.
The iGEM 2016 team is constituted of:
4 students from INSA Toulouse in fourth year of Biochemical Engineering: Anissa Dieudonné, Marine Dubois, Oumnia Karim and Fanny Leclerc.
4 students from Paul Sabatier University in first year of MABS Master: Manon Barthe         and Camille Roux (specialized in Genetics / Microbiology), Eve Coutant (specialized in         AgroBioSciences) and Soukaïna Timouma (specialized in Bioinformatics and Systems         Biology).
3 teachers: Kaymeuang Cam (IPBS), Brice Enjalbert (LISBP) and Gilles Truan (LISBP).         Kaymeuang Cam, researcher at the Institute of Pharmacology and Structural Biology (IPBS) is         the Primary PI.
Students
LET THE SHOW BEGIN !!!
Eve Coutant
Eve has a Masters degree in Agrosciences. She is the quiet yet powerful strength of the team and exudes zen vibes. Never too short, her hair keeps disappearing as the weeks go by. Our only fear: she may end up bald by the time we land in Boston!        In the lab, she started with cloning, followed with fungi, and is now in charge of ethics… Where will her next adventure take her?
Soukaïna Timouma
Soukaïna is the savior of the team. She is the only one with a master in Bioinformatics, so she is in charge of the wiki, modeling and the device! In spite of it all, she still comes up with brilliant ideas like pipetting ice cubes, something we would never have thought of. Mom of the team, she also keeps or blood sugar high thanks to her weekly supply of candy!
Fanny Leclerc
Fanny studies Biochemistry engineering and is in charge of public relations. She is super connected: Facebook and Twitter are her best friends! She takes care of the team’s image et is our very personal paparazzi: she is always ready to take pictures of us in every situation possible. Fanny is resourceful and has made it her life mission to take us to Boston the cheapest way possible and on time for the Giant Jamboree!
Marine Dubois
If tidying up was a subject at university, Marine would be head of her class: she is a bit of a clean freak! (but we love her nevertheless). In reality though, Marine studies Biochemistry engineering.        Without her, we would be beggars in the street, drowning in our despair. Treasurer and therefore pillar of the team, she has the difficult task of finding funds for our project. Think of her as a modern Scrooge!
Anissa Dieudonné
Anissa studies Biochemistry engineering and soon will be specialized in aquatic biology. She will be reunited with water, her favorite element! Rowing, the deep Corsican sea, and sushi are a few of her passions.         She is also the athlete of the team, and her bicycle is her best friend: she takes it everywhere! Her intense work outs keep her active until dawn.         In the lab she is the queen of gene design and knows all the sequences by heart!
Camille Roux
With a Masters in microbiology and genetics, Camille also applies for the title of queen of fungi, since she knows them best in the team. She is very known for her punctuality (we are still not sure if her watch is on time). You want to cook poached eggs in a mug? Ask Camille AKA the Mac Gyver of cooking: she has not stopped impressing us during lunch hours with her special tricks!
Manon Barthe
Manon studies Genetics and Microbiology. She is a good advice giver, and takes care of all the clonings. She is also a prankster: water battles, ice throws and upside down gel migrations are her specialty, and she never ceases to impress us. Her fuel: coffee. She has not quite found the perfect recipe yet and we bet that by the end of the summer it will not taste like gas anymore.
Oumnia Karim
With a master in biochemical engineering, Oumnia brings Morocco to us everyday! Little piece of sunshine, she dances, sings and lights us up with her smile! She will not get the ""Queen of the lab"" price but not doubt she will be rewarded for all her little mistakes (RIP the smelly medium)! ;)
Advisors and Instructors
Kaymeuang Cam
M. Kaymeuang Cam, university teacher in microbiology led this project wonderfully well. His advice and his availability were welcome for the team all over the year. Moreover, thanks to his quasi-weekly complement in sugar (donuts and doughnuts), we could be getting ready for Boston three months before leaving!
Brice Enjalbert
M. Brice Enjalbert, researcher in Biosystem and Process Engineering devoted a lot of his personal time helping and advising us in the project. We can remember every of his numerous schemas explaining some experiments and scientific aspects that helped us a lot.
Gilles Truan
M. Gilles Truan, researcher in molecular and metabolic engineering was indispensable during the brainstorming steps of the project. He helped us a lot thank to his incredible knowledge about the iGEM competition and synthetic biology.
Stéphanie Heux
Mrs. Stéphanie Heux, researcher in Biotechnology, helped us a lot during meetings thanks to her creativity and her good mood. She was also very invested at the event ""the European Night of Researchers"" for our stand and created a wonderful 3D cell in polystyrene.

The iGEM competition is rich in acquiring knowledge as well as in emotions. The emotional part can be correlated with the success of the lab experimentation, as it soars when cloning are successful, and declines when they fails. It is a real roller coaster!
More seriously, we have acquired many skills throughout this competition. In addition of the scientific knowledge, we improved our communication skills. The dialog to the general public, about our project and synthetic biology, is an important part of this competition. Moreover, as media were interested in our project, we made several interviews and thus we trained to vulgarize scientifics subjects. As we needed to find sponsors we also became experts in phone harassment.
This project about the Lascaux cave was borned in April 2016, when we chose our subject for the iGEM competition. All the members of our team have assumed every aspect of the project, from the beginning to the end of it. The main phases of this project are quoted below, but more details about the task repartition are given in the last part of the page:
The bibliographic phase, to get more information about the Lascaux cave ecosystem
The design of our constructions, and the experiments in the lab
The wiki construction and the modelling
The fundraising and the sponsors seeking
The communication with the media
This amazing experience could not be possible without the help we received, and thus we would like to thank all the persons who contributed in the Paleotilis project, by sharing their experience, their knowledge, and their interest.
General support
Our thanks to:
M. Kaymeuang Cam for leading this project, for his advice and his availability.
M. Brice Enjalbert and Gilles Truan, who devoted so much time helping and advising us in the project.
All our advisors who helped us develop our ideas during the brainstorming, and volunteered their knowledge of synthetic biology, microbiology…
The LISBP that, as a financial and technical support, gave us a full access to the lab and the material we needed, allowing us to work under very good conditions all through the summer.
The INSA that let us work all the summer in the well equipped labs.
Our sponsors, for the financial support that enabled us to give reality to our project.
We also would like to thank the people who helped us during our brainstorming sessions to find the most appropriate subject for our project: Stéphane Génin, Nemo Peters, Christophe Roux, Matthieu Arlat, Alice Boulanger, Bernard Martin, Marie Renault, Valérie Réat, Georges Czaplicki, Marc Prudhomme, and Marie Poueymiro
Project support
The Lascaux cave is a world heritage that is accessible to a few number of people, and reviews about it are quite rare. We could not lead our project without the help of persons working on this cave. First of all we would like to thank Muriel Mauriac, who, as a Lascaux cave conservator, guided us at the beginning of our project about the Lascaux historic. Special thanks to Yvan Moënne-Loccose, microbiologist of the Lascaux cave, who helped us analyzing the state of the cave and gave us precious scientific remarks concerning our project. Jean-Jacques Cleyet-Merle, as director of the national prehistory museum, encouraged us in our activity.
Predation support
The aim of the predation module was to improve the efficiency of Bacillus subtilis to target bacteria and to use them as carbon sources. Getting Pseudomonas fluorescens strains was essential, as it is one of the microorganisms present in the Lascaux cave. Marie-Line Daveran-Mingot and Marie-Pierre Castanié provided us several strains of this bacteria.     The construction of this part was realized by Gibson cloning. We are grateful to Yvan Cam, who took time to work with us on this cloning and helped us with the problems met.
Antifungal support
Working on fungi was a necessity to test the module associated. Christophe Roux helped us by providing fungi strains, and advising us about protocols and the best ways to use them.
The 2014 iGEM Toulouse team worked on antifungals and thus made construction allowing the secretion of several molecules. Their advice and their experience were useful and helped us being more efficient on the experiments of the antifungals module. Special thanks to Mathieu Fournié and Pierre Reitzer.
Fundraising help
Our thanks to M. Claude Maranges, who helped us by giving us new lines of search for sponsoring. We also thank David Cribbs and Marie-Line Daveran-Mingot who helped us fundraising.
Lab support
We would like to thank Jara Radeck, from the iGEM Munich 2012 team, for providing us shuttle plasmids between Bacillus subtilis and Escherichia coli bacteria, from their own project. The plasmids are the following: pSBBS0K-P, pSBBS1C, pSBBS2E and pSBBS4S. Our thanks to Jean-Philippe Castex (LIPM/CNRS-INRA Toulouse) for advicing us about B. subtilis protocols.
The iGEM Munich 2014 team worked with the sdp operon. For our predation module, Philipp Popp accepted to provide us with strains containing constructions with sdpI.
We also would like to address our special thanks to all the researchers who gave us crucial strains and plasmids for our Paleotilis project.

Wiki support
Our friend and teammate Soukaïna Timouma is studying bioinformatics at the University Paul Sabatier of Toulouse, and she was able to create on her own and to upload all the wiki. We thank her for their heavy and time-consuming work. The team presentation page contains drawings of the team members made by Esther Coutant, and we are grateful to her.
Presentation coaching
Having a good presentation at the Giant Jamboree is important as it represents the purpose of the project. Brice Enjalbert, throughout its three-year experience in this competition, was a source of valuable tips. Special thanks to Kaymeuang Cam for his precious advice and his constructive feedback.
Modelling support
The creation of the predator-prey model took time, and Soukaïna Timouma, member of the iGEM Toulouse team and student in bioinformatics, could not face with both the modelisation and the wiki designing without help. We would like to address a special thank to Serge Mazeres and to Arnaud Volle, from the IPBS laboratory, for their help on the use of the Blender software.      Your help was precious for us.
Human Practices support
In the frame of the human practices part, we developed a theatre play about GMOs, which can conduct to a debate. Alexia Dumas (PhD student) was really involved in this project, and it was successful only thanks to her as she led it entirely. Our script evolved under the supervision of Matthieu Pouget, artistic director and teacher at the University of Toulouse 2.     It was important for our team to explain to the general public what the synthetic biology is.
We also wanted to meet pupils in order to initiate them to the biology. As a result, we developed an educational kit that explains what DNA is and why it is important. This project was led by Arthur Sarrade-Loucheur (PhD student), who was rich in ideas and creativity.
During the iGEM adventure, we participated to several events in Toulouse, in particular one renowned event called La Nuit des chercheurs that gathers scientists from all fields. Thomas Lautier organized our participation at this event, and we are grateful for the time he invested in it.
Ethics support
We thank Vincent Grégoire-Delory, responsible of the ethics platform at Toulouse White Biotechnology, for advising us and discussing with us about the ethical reflections of our project.

Dinula De Silva
I am a grade 12 student at Winston Churchill High School. I enjoy programming, playing the guitar, and watching movies. When I’m not stuck indoors, I like going running and biking. I joined iGEM because the feats of synthetic biology fascinated me and I wanted to learn more about the processes involved. I additionally wanted to develop my computer programming skills by working on the wiki and software aspect of the competition.
Nimaya De Silva
Hello! My name is Nimaya De Silva, and I go to Winston Churchill High School. I am 16 years old and this is my first year of iGEM. I joined iGEM to gain more experience in the lab, and to venture more into the world of biology. But I have also found myself working on human practices as well and have been thoroughly enjoying it!  Besides iGEM, I love to read anything and everything to do with dystopia and Harry Potter! I also take piano lessons, and love to recreate pop songs on the piano!
Anileen Pageni
Hey everyone! My name is Anileen and I am going to be graduating this year from Winston Churchill High School. I will be joining the Physiology program in the University of Alberta this fall! I enjoy every aspect of iGem, but especially love getting involved in the lab and human practices. I joined iGem to further my interest in science and be around like-minded people, which is why this is my second year in iGem. Other than iGem, I enjoy making people laugh, traveling, watching movies and trying out new recipes!
Marissa King
Hello, my name is Marissa King. I am 17 years old and am a grade 12 student at Winston Churchill High School. In the fall I will begin university here in Lethbridge where I will be studying biological sciences. This is my second year being involved in iGEM and i love every aspect of it but my favourite part would have to be working in the lab. I initially joined iGEM to because of my interest in synthetic biology and to gain more experience. Other than iGEM i enjoy travelling, reading, taking photos and spending time with my friends and family.
Ross Oliver
Hello I'm Ross and I am a grade 11 student at Winston Churchill High School. I was interested in re-joining iGEM because of the opportunities and knowledge that it has provide me. Prior to joining iGEM I had no lab experience, and had very limited knowledge about synthetic biology. In my free time I enjoy learning new things,cooking and traveling.
Ronja Kothe
Hello! My name is Ronja. I am 18 years old and in my final year at Winston Churchill High School. In the  fall I will be attending the University of Alberta in the Immunology & Infection program. This is my third  year in iGEM and I have really enjoyed my experience both in the lab and outside of it. In addition to  iGEM, I enjoy playing the clarinet and I’m also a proud Girl Guide. One of my favourite foods are granola  bars, partly because they’re great for camping, which, as a Girl Guide, I also love to do.
Mason Mierzewski
Hi, my name is Mason Mierzewski, and I am a 16 year old student that will be going into grade twelve at Catholic Central High School ensuing the summer. This is my first year participating in iGem, and I have found it to be a very enlightening experience. In my free time, I enjoy playing sports casually or competitively as well as just hanging out with my friends. I am also a fervent fan of music, as I listen to it daily and use it to help me with many tasks. So far, my iGem experience has been congenial and I am very excited to see our project come to its completion.
Advisors
Chris Issac
Hi there. I’m Chris. This year the title of codemeister has been thrust upon me and I hope that by the time the website is done, you’ll be able to be here reading this. For now, I’m working on finishing up my B.Sc. and splitting my time between work, iGEM, and pursing a career as a purveyor of terrible jokes.
Sydnee
Hello, I’m Sydnee! Once upon a time I thought I was going to be a psychologist, but then I decided science was a lot more fun. This is my second year being involved with iGEM and I am enjoying my time working on human practices.
Kieran
Hello, my name is Kieran McCormack. I am currently finished my second year of Biochemistry at the University of Lethbridge, which allows for a nice contrast between the normal science world and the more defined synthetic biology world. I enjoy doing new activities and have found great joy from being an adviser on the team; whether that be through new friendships, communications or spread of knowledge. I have enjoyed learning about myself throughout this year, and hopefully I can continue to do so into the future.
Brian
I am a Structural Biochemist and new to Synthetic Biology and iGEM. I love the idea of being able to make whatever I want in the lab. Previously I have used NMR and X-ray crystallography to look at protein-protein interactions. My wife is a Biochemist also, which makes dinner conversation interesting (for us anyways).
HJ
Originally from Germany I moved to Canada in 2005 to start a research group on the structure and function of the bacterial protein synthesis machinery, a cellular process targeted by over 50% of the known antibiotics. I am intrigued by the molecular design and function of this essential bio-nanomachine. I try to unravel the underlying design principles in order to enable the rational design and engineering of novel bio-nanomachines. I am essentially asking the question if such novel bio-machines can be constructed from simple and fundamental principles or are these assemblies just to complex. Well and that’s why it was extremely easy to rope me into doing iGEM.

Kalen Clifton
✻
Kalen is a junior studying biology and applied mathematics. The interdisciplinary nature of our project appeals to her desire to blend her interests. Kalen believes the intersection of disciplines is a great source for innovation.         She became interested in science and research at a young age.  One of her childhood memories is of constructing a zoo         for her dolls to attend, even doing the research to write placards for each animal exhibit. Her continued interest         in constructing and designing things has driven her to pursue a career in bioengineering. Eventually she sees herself         researching evolutionarily optimized biological structures so that their design can be replicated when engineering         biological and non-biological structures. Outside of the lab, Kalen spends her time tutoring elementary students,         watching movies, and playing volleyball.
Ethan Jones
✻
Ethan is a sophomore pursuing a B.S. in Biology and Computational & Applied Mathematics & Statistics. For as         long as he can remember he’s always wanted to be a scientist both because of his love of learning and because         of his desire to change the world. Ethan was especially excited to work on iGEM this summer because synthetic         biology is a relatively young field and there is a lot that we don't know yet. Additionally, synthetic biology         is a field that has a lot of potential to change the future of medicine and the world at large. In his spare         time Ethan enjoys perusing local culture forums to consume and create various image and text based communications,         as well as learning highly specific useless facts and playing tennis.

Lab members lent us cell lines of Hela, A549, MCF-7, 293T, parts of mCherry and CYAN, and all the vectors we needed for experiments. They also generously gave us advice on many experimental details.
Supports from other teams
    iGEM is a big family!
Exchange ideas with SZU, FAFU and XMU
     After Synbiobeta Activate-Shenzhen, team SZU founded a meet up to exchange ideas. During the meet up, we help SZU to debug the construction of their circuits and the project design.
Exchange parts with SYSU-Software and FAFU-China
     We shared iGEM interlab kits and iGEM plate kits with SYSU-Software. During our experiments, we found out that one of our Interlab plasmids (Device I) could not be transformed well in bacterial culture medium. So we borrowed some plasmids from SYSU-Software. Furthermore, SYSU-Software had used up one of their plate kits (B0015 terminator) and we gave them ours.
     We received several parts (CFP, YFP) from team FAFU-China when the shipment of Biobrick to China is still confusing. Sincerely thanks to FAFU-China!

TEAM
Our team was founded in the middle of 2015 and it is made up of 10 students of the Biomedical Engineering degree of the Universitat Pompeu Fabra who are really fond of science. As the interests of each member of our group vary from Engineering to Biology and Medicine, we form a highly interdisciplinary team capable of facing all the challenges of this project. We have acquired all the technologic and biologic knowledge and tools necessary with the practices developed during the degree and in the internships that each of us has done in important institutions such as: the Department of Experimental and Health Sciences (DCEXS) of the UPF, the Vall d’Hebron Research Institute (VHIR) or the Bellvitge Biomedical Research Institute (IDIBELL).
We are not only fond of science but also willing to help society. We strongly believe we can really make a change. Our attitude and permanent insistence were the key elements which made our university teachers allow us to start this project.
As the majority of her comrades, she picked up the project without much actual knowledge about working in the lab. However, that did not prevent her from acquiring very fast the skills and actually became one of the people that spent more time surrounded by pipettes, jars of LB and lots of (really, lots of) Eppendorf’s and plates. She also has been very successful at directing and managing the team, as she was in charge of doing all the crazy paperwork that funding a company requires. Her joyful spirit also has created a perfect environment for teamwork, and her house has recently become the unofficial headquarters of our team where, as I write this, the wiki is being typed at unbelievable speeds.
If we are to thank anyone for having achieved all this, he should be the first one. Back in 2014, he proposed the idea of starting the first iGEM team of our university and the second in our city since the first edition of the competition. He tricked the minds of some of his classroom mates and gathered a raid of 10 people (more than 25% of the class) to carry it out. Besides his obvious entrepreneurship skills, he has actively participated in the funding of our company, the development of our website and wiki, and, of course, invested a lot of hours in the lab going through quite a lot of coli hardships. Some say that, during his spare time, he has been developing a plan for world domination involving an army of highly trained monkeys.
She joined iGEM because she was willing to start her own project with her classmates. She thought iGEM could be a great way to learn more about the scientific world and at the same time spend the summer with good company. She is particularly interested in medicine and she was the one who pushed their colleagues to undertake a project related to this field. She truly believes that with effort one can always make a difference, and she works hard to achieve it.
Born in Barcelona (1995), at age 18 he decided to enter at the degreee of biomedical engineering, from which he found iGEM. It was a difficult time for the commitment implied decision but the experience and scope of the project led him to embark on this adventure.He expects the Giant Jamboree to be an unforgettable experience, the best is yet to come. He always says that the best things in life are those that are not planned but just happen, that's why he has not thought about his future yet, but in any case he believes that you have to like what you do for it to be worth it
Tricked into iGEM, he ended up enjoying the experience quite a bit, even though he seldom stepped in the lab, preferring instead to lurk in the shadows programing models in python. He may still not know how to set up a miniprep, but at least his programs don’t crash on startup anymore. Not as often anyways.
A true genius at math, medical imaging, physiology and pathology, programming, project management… what is she doing in the iGEM team? Well, thanks god that we have her because she is one of the people that worked hardest in the project. Her unique skills at organization and her rigorous and constant work even during the hardest moments have made these last 12 months infinitely easier. Between clonings and minipreps, we have spent really enjoyable moments with her commenting on movies, animes and mangas, or even drawing our favorite characters in the whiteboard of the lab. Also a very kakkoii person too.
Willy joined iGEM eager of facing new challenges. As he once said: “He is of the ones that enjoys looking for solutions to apparently really difficult questions”. Since he was one of the team members with more lab experience, he worked a lot in writing the protocols and designing some of the experiments in the lab. He has also been the soul of the lab making jokes and lifting people’s spirit untiringly. He loves going to a sushi buffet in Barcelona which is right now our sacred temple.
Elected spokeswoman of the team for her leadership skills, she has been a key member all the way to the very end of the journey. Her determination to get as far as possible and interest for the project have inspired us all to keep working restlessly even during the hardest times. Her vast theoretical research, mathematical models, presentation skills and ability to spam the inbox of hundreds of researchers simultaneously have demonstrated to be unmatched, and have been a key factor for the success of the project. Next January, she will be travelling to Cambridge University to end her career, and then she already has an appointment in the United States to fulfill her ambition of working with the top stem cell research laboratories worldwide
Núria joined iGEM driven by her passion for science and maths.                             Although she spent all summer in the lab, she enjoyed learning new laboratory stuff, modeling polyamine pathways, and in particular, finding solutions for every problem she had to face during this challenging experience. Being social and loving to speak in front of people, she is one of the team members involved in making our project known to social media. You could say she is our community manager.
Advisors
We also have two advisors, Carlos Toscano and Salva Duran, who have kindly supervised and helped us all along the project and to whom we are sincerely grateful.
Joan is the oldest from our group, which is why he appears as an advisor, however he has been one of us since the first moment. He already obtained a degree in psychology, but no, he has not psychoanalyzed us all (yet)! He has managed to create all the mathematical models and simulations using Python, he has saved us all from the hard job of building a model by using kinematics. He is very into modeling and has a very good vision for informatics and mathematics (smart guy), which is one of the many reasons he will finish his degree at Cambridge University working with the brain, the thing he likes the most to model.
Multicellularity has been invented more than twenty-five times independently over the course of the evolution of our biosphere despite being plagued with numerous challenges: cheaters, cancer and the efficient construction of form. Using wet-lab and dry-lab approximations, Salva tries to reconstruct general features of multicellular systems: from the rules necessary to build structures and patterns in the developing embryo to the selective pressures that can drive this major transition in evolution. He is also a founding member and VP of Moirai Biodesign, a company developing new technologies for leukemia diagnostics and therapeutics using RNA synthetic biology tools.
Born in Sevilla in 1985, he started his studies at Universidad de Sevilla in Mathematics and then switched to Biology. Meanwhile he joined Dr. Enrique Cerdá-Olmedo's lab focused in Phycomices genetics and participated in iGEM 2011. After that, he did his master in biomedical research at Universitat Pompeu Fabra (UPF) in Barcelona, where he is doing now his PhD in systems biology with Dr. Jordi Garcia-Ojalvo. Now he is investigating E. coli stationary phase and advising UPF's iGEM team. He still likes maths and enjoys playing piano.

External Advisors
We are very thankful with the help via email from all the people that we bothered and decided to give us their opinion about our project. Dr. Eugene W. Gerner gave us at the beginnings of our project greate advice about how we could focus our ideas. He is a Chief Scientific Officer, Board Member, Co-Founder at Cancer Prevention Pharmaceuticals and one of the biggest help we had to better understand the world of polyamines. We would also like to say thank Dr. Masao Kawakita, from the Stem Cell Project, Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Medical Scienceo, who gave us great advice about polyamine-like molecules. Finally, we would like to thank Dr. David Christianson and Dr. Nicolas Porter from the University of Pennsylvania, Department of Chemistry for sending us a plasmid with polyamine deacetylase.
Collaborations
iGEM UPO Sevilla Collaboration
From our modelling and computational work came the wonderful opportunity to colaborate with another iGem team, UPOSevilla.  Both teams were working on metabolic analysis, and had developed a tool to facilitate analysis of complex enzymatic pathways. However, our two aproaches were quite diferent. Sevilla’s team focused on velocity and straight-forwardness with a C script that took the input as text files and displayed the output as another text file, a log of the different concentrations of the different compounds over time. Visualitzation or post-processing of the data was left to the user, which made the program more modular, albeit less user friendly. Our approach, Polyenzime, was a bit widder in scope, incorporating inhibition reactions and source/sink nodes, and consisted on a GUI where the user could intuitively create and run the pathways, obtaining the evolution of the system in handy graphics without further ado.
Comparing the two prespectives on the same problem gave us the opportunity to further develop our approach, strengthing its downsides (implementation of a runge-kuta algorithm to make the integration more robust), and reinforcing the advantages (improving the user experience in a variety of ways). We could also interchange valuable feedback that lead to some bug-fixes and improvements. This would not have been possible without intensive comunication between the teams, and we thank the collegues at Sevilla for the patience and support trough our programming endavours.
With the wide array of topics iGEM comprises, finding another team with a common front to collaborate with may be difficult. We were lucky to have that opportunity, and we belive that the project has improved and gained context as a consequence.
In the image we can see a model of UPO-Sevilla’s team represented in our software.
iGEM Paris Bettencourt
As iGEM competition promotes collaboration, we are helping this team by providing them products related to our vineyards, so that they can find microorganisms that can naturally digest wine and try to enhance their ability so as to make a potent, biological wine stain removing device. We wish them a lot of luck!
Sponsors
Our team also received help from many institutions. It is because of them that we could live this adventure and we could not be more thankful to them. These are all our sponsors:

The University of Georgia’s iGEM team has worked very hard over the course of the past summer. We have learned much about the field of synthetic biology and have grown significantly as scientists in our attempt to expand the use of Archaea in the field of Synthetic Biology. This would not have been possible without the contributions of the many people and organizations listed below.
A very special thanks to:
The first group that we must thank is the University of Georgia Microbiology Department. They have allowed us to use their equipment and provided us with the lab space needed to conduct our experiments. The Microbiology department has also provided us with essential funding to reach our experimental goals, as well as travel to the Jamboree to present our research. In particular, thank you to all graduate students in Dr. William Whitman’s Lab for equipment handling instruction.
The College of Engineering also played an instrumental role in our success. The graduates students provided us with much needed guidance that to ensure the success of the modeling project. Moreover, Dr. Yan’s lab was useful because of the state of the art equipment, which we were allowed to use. Finally, we are especially grateful for their financial support, which was used to defray the cost of attending the Jamboree.
We would also like to express our gratitude to the University of Tennessee, Columbia University, University of Nebraska, GENSPACE, Georgia State University, and University of Pittsburg iGEM teams for their participation in our Archeal Interlab Study.
Finally we would like to make to again thank our instructors and advisers for the time and energy they put into the project. We are extremely grateful and feel fortunate to have such dedicated and knowledgeable aid help us complete our project.

Dr.  Zhe  Lyu
I have been working on many aspects of methanogenic archaea, including their physiology and ecology, since my doctoral studies. Working with a group of talented and passionate iGEM students, I am currently focused on developing tools for genetic engineering of Methanococcus maripaludis, an excellent model organism for methanogenic archaea. Because of its uniquely autotrophic and methanogenic metabolism, we are constructing M. maripaludis as a platform species for making high value biochemicals with an ultra-small carbon footprint. As a proof of concept, we have recently demonstrated that a recombinant M. maripaludis strain could produce geraniol using H2 and CO2 or formate when a synthetic geraniol synthase gene was heterologously expressed (Lyu., et al., 2016, ACS Syn Biol). In parallel, the same set of genetic tools has also enabled us to explore some fundamental molecular mechanisms for methanogenesis (In progress). Another unique feature of M. maripaludis is that it shares many genes with human in the information processing system (Lyu and Whitman, 2016, CMLS). Therefore, our platform could also promote development of an archaeal model for certain human diseases (In progress).
Dr. Narendran Sekar
Narendran Sekar is one of the instructors of UGA-Georgia iGEM team since 2013. He holds a Ph.D. in Biological and Agricultural Engineering from UGA.

Acknolwedgements
Drew Endy, PhD. The original motivation for this project came from Dr. Drew Endy's vision to propagate synthetic biology worldwide.  We believe the reason that this is not reality is that individual researchers do not have the common language and tools to effectively collaborate with one another to achieve the most ambitious projects.  Thus, Dr. Endy provided us with guidance in moving forward to further develop the tools and the functional standards required to propel bioengineering into the future.
Endy Lab We would also like to specially thank the Endy Lab for helping us to establish protocols and troubleshoot when problems arose.
BioBricks Foundation We would like to thank the BioBricks Foundation for funding this project and giving us this opportunity to participate in the 2016 iGEM Jamboree"

SCAU China iGEM–wiki support
This summer, we contacted with iGEM team SCAU-China and had a meeting with them. In the meeting, the members of SCAU-China shared us some experience about team building, doing experiments, building models and making wiki.
And we learnt about that in their project, rice was used as the material to produce astaxanthin, which was supposed to be an economic way to produce astaxanthin. They wanted to know what will be the cost of the astaxanthin and we also had an interest on this, so we proposed to make a comparison of the costs for astaxanthin productions in different method. Finally, we could find that rice could be a great kind of material to produce astaxanthin because it could lower the price of astaxanthin greatly and made astaxanthin more accessible to the public.

From the team
We are a group of undergraduate students from different fields with a common interest in biology.
×
Arunavo Chakraborty
Year: 3rd,  Major: Chemistry; Minor: Biology
""I am a chemistry enthusiast with a recent inclination toward biology. What excites me the most about field is the incredible plethora of chemical reactions in biological systems that would (and do) give any chemist a run for their money. Currently, the topics that interest me are enzyme mechanics, peptide design and biomimetic chemistry. My (only) other companions are select manga and MMO (note, not RP) games.""
×
Abhijeet Krishna
Year: 3rd,  Major:Physics
""Hello! I have always believed that simple scientific ideas can influence society greatly and that is exactly what I am trying to show in iGEM. I am married to Physics and have an affair with Biology. I am a Calvin and Hobbes fan and can’t resist kebabs.""
×
Prabaha Gangopadhyay
Year: 3rd,  Major: Biology
""I like learning about mechanisms underlying the existence of life. I find myself comfortable in the overlap of theoretical and experimental biology, because of the extreme interdisciplinary nature of the area, and being at IISc has allowed me to explore it. I am interested in doing my final year project, and eventually my PhD, in Neuroscience. Other than science, I love literature, classical music, and, like any other undergrad, food!""
×
Shreyas Gopalakrishnan
Year: 3rd,  Major: Biology; Minor: Physics
""I am interested in the problems in biology, but using a variety of physical and other methods/approaches to show consistent, robust and reproducible results. Recently, I also became interested in designing experiments, especially in stem cell biology and cell imaging. I'd like to learn general principles from diverse areas of science so that I can apply them in biology. In my free time, I listen to generic pop music.""
×
Aiswarya Prasad
Year: 2nd,  Major:Undecided (Biology, eventually)
""I have always been most fascinated by how life works, by virtue of nothing more than 'molecules'. I enjoy learning and thinking about most things that even remotely belong in the realm of science. I wish to pursue whatever it is that intrigues me most, wherever that takes me. I also enjoy reading, classical music and occasionally gaming.""
×
Ayan Das
Year: 2nd,  Major: Unassigned. (Most likely Biology)
""I am mostly interested in biology but with a strong inclination towards maths and computation. Papers that don't have equations bore the life out of me! I easily get interested in just about anything. I have no concrete plans for the future. At the moment, I'm just enjoying everything that I am getting to learn. Apart from science, I like writing and playing the keyboard (which I have just started learning). Hopefully, I'll contribute something significant to the scientific community some day.""
×
Aneesh Baburaj
Year: 2nd,  Major:Unassigned.
""I believe that every living being is a complex machine which needs to be understood and synthetic biology permits that by mimicing events and organisms. And that's why I find biology very intriguing.""
×
Jessica

He and his group are researching signaling and regulation in bacterial cells, focusing in particular on regulatory phenomena based on protein phosphorylation. He made a big difference to us, both in terms of funding and expertise.
Instructors
Gustaf Edman, MSc student, Raphael Ferreira, David Bergenholm, PhD students, are all former iGEM participants. Their experiences with practical and theoretical systems biology as well as being familiar with the competition was a great help to us. They were always ready to discuss and help us with our choice of primers, PCR conditions, provide us with protocols, preparing us for our presentation and many other things. The list is very long and their efforts have truly been appreciated. We also got chocolate cake once.
Other teams
The 2015 Amsterdam iGEM team
Our project starts roughly where the 2015 Amsterdam iGEM team left off, they were undoubtedly our biggest inspiration. We strived to expand on their idea through creating a modular library of symbiotic organisms to suit the needs of chemical synthesis demands. The possible implications of a successful development of this idea is what sparked our interest.

ATTRIBUTIONS
We wholeheartedly thank all of the following individuals and institutions for their interest, enthusiasm, and gracious contributions to the development of the CRISPR Capsules project. Their contributions to the project are commendable, and the extent to which their expertise enriched our understanding of synthetic biology is more greatly treasured.
All lab work was completed on the Northwestern University Evanston campus by the members of Northwestern iGEM 2016 unless otherwise noted.
General Support
Our faculty advisers Drs. Mike Jewett, Joshua Leonard, and Keith Tyo talked us through our arduous brainstorming process and guided us as we worked towards our project vision. They also helped the iGEM members in Northwestern’s McCormick School of Engineering and Applied Science obtain grants for living in Evanston over the summer.
Our outstanding graduate student advisors Bradley Biggs, Will Bothfeld, Benjamin Des Soye, Taylor Dolberg, Patrick Donahue, Quentin Dudley, Joseph Muldoon, Kelly Schwarz, Sara Stainbrook, and Peter Su donated time out of their busy lives to discuss our project with us and guide us through our lab experience.
Dr. John Mordacq, lab director and professor of Northwestern University’s Program in Biological Sciences, obligingly accommodated us with a lab space and necessary equipment for our summer experience. He also helped the iGEM members in Northwestern’s Weinberg College of Arts and Sciences obtain grants for traveling and living in Evanston over the summer.
Starting NU iGEM 2016
In February 2016, Northwestern iGEM 2016 was born in a library study room in the presence of chocolate chip cookies and the enthusiastic faces of members of the Northwestern iGEM 2014 team. Thank you for recruiting us and kickstarting an accomplished team dynamic that evolved into staunch friendship.
We would like to thank our phenomenal graduate student TAs for their guidance and dedication to our “bootcamps,” our beginning lab protocol tutorial workshops. Special thanks to Kelly Schwarz, Patrick Donahue, Peter Su, Bradley Biggs, Will Bothfeld, Sara Stainbrook, and Quentin Dudley for walking us through basic lab procedures throughout the spring term before we officially began independent work.
We met with our faculty advisers on a weekly basis during the spring term to zone in on a project direction. Thank you, Drs. Mike Jewett, Joshua Leonard, and Keith Tyo for your mentorship and willingness to discuss project ideas throughout our long brainstorming process.
Lab Support
Technique and Troubleshooting
Thank you to all of the graduate students of the Leonard, Tyo, Jewett, and Bagheri labs who jumped on board to talk to us about our project and help us over the summer!
Kelly Schwarz met with us almost every day to talk to us about our project progress, troubleshooting, and handling the MTAs between our university and Cornell and MIT. She made sure we were caught up on deadlines and gave us our first lesson on how to pour culture plates during the iGEM “bootcamps.” She was unbelievably prompt when we asked her questions through email and kindly provided us with encouraging words whenever we found ourselves in a rut. To the best TA we could have asked for, thank you for your infinite knowledge and patience throughout the summer. We couldn’t have done it without you.
Patrick Donahue walked us through running golden gate assemblies, sending DNA off for sequencing, and helped us troubleshoot our transformations by letting us run streak plate tests with him in Dr. Leonard’s lab. During one of our Bootcamp sessions, he taught us how to run a gel and how to run a restriction digest protocol.
Bradley Biggs taught us how to use Genome Compiler to design our constructs and advised us through the weeks-long process of our first designs. He also helped us troubleshoot our Gibson assembly reactions. During our Bootcamps, he walked us through running our first transformation protocol.
Peter Su helped us make calculations for our first Gibson assembly. He, along with Patrick, taught us how to run gels and restriction digest procedures.
Sara Stainbrook ran our first Bootcamp. She walked us through our first PCR reaction and cleanup, gel imaging, and mixing buffers/reagents.
Will Bothfeld helped us run our first transformation protocol during a Bootcamp session. He also developed a cloning log that helped us determine insert-to-backbone ratios for our Gibson assemblies.
Joseph Muldoon sat in on our weekly meetings and discussed troubleshooting and project progress with us.
Quentin Dudley walked us through our first plasmid miniprep procedure and making glycerol stocks during one of our Bootcamps. During this Bootcamp session he showed us the basics of optical density spectrophotometry.
Benjamin Des Soye graciously ran our western blots with supplies from Dr. Jewett’s lab. He walked us through each step and explained how each part of the procedure worked. He also demonstrated the use of an electroporator when it was needed for transformations.
Taylor Dolberg helped us make stocks of chemically competent cells.
Materials
Thank you to the labs of Drs. Jewett, Leonard, and Tyo for providing us with some reagents to start off our research and to keep us going through late-night experiments, and to Drs. Mordacq and Huaru Yan, who provided us with lab equipment and troubleshooting advice.
Dr. Matthew DeLisa from Cornell University provided us with a hypervesicular strain of E. coli (JC8031) and a His-ClyA-GFP plasmid. The hypervesicular strain is sourced (with permission) from the lab of Dr. Roland Lloubes from the Institute of Microbiology of the Mediterranean.
The lab of Dr. Feng Zhang from the Broad Institute provided us with a plasmid for S. pyogenes Cas9.
Additional Support
Thank you to Dr. Danielle Tullman-Ercek, who advised us on effective periplasm-directing translocation pathways to utilize in our device construction, and to Dr. Michelle Hung, who advised us on working with and purifying vesicles and helped us brainstorm characterization experiments for our project.
Drs. Michael Postelnick, Stephen Persell (MD/MPH), and Marc Sheetz (PharmD) donated their time to answer our questions about the ethical administration of antibiotics despite high public demand for these drugs for our human practices research. Thank you for taking the time to speak with us.
Building with Biology provided us with a means of educating Evanston youth about biotechnology and its applications. They provided us with a kit of activities and exciting discussions we could share with students participating in summer camps at Northwestern. Using our kit from Building with Biology, we were able to partner up with Northwestern University’s Center for Talent Development (CTD) to have an engaging conversation about gene drives. We also gave them a tour of Dr. Jewett’s lab space, where the students made fluorescent bacteria art on culture plates. Northwestern University’s Society of Women Engineers (SWE) hosted its annual Summer Technology and Engineering Program . We talked about biotechnology to the group of girls participating in the event, and facilitated an activity involving isolating DNA from wheat germ using dish soap and rubbing alcohol. The activity was also inspired part of the kit provided by Building with Biology.
Emma Nechamkin from Teach for America allowed us to teach her high school biotechnology class at Perspectives Middle Academy in Auburn Gresham, a neighborhood in the south side of Chicago. Her students had never been exposed to research science, so we were allowed to give them a one-day lecture on CRISPR and antibiotic resistance. Thank you so much for giving us the chance to visit your classroom!
Jessica Yu and Joseph Muldoon helped us troubleshoot our wiki styling problems.
Thank you Drs. Leonard, Tyo and all of our graduate students for helping us with our presentating skills.
Team Roles
Our team emphasizes the integration of skills in all aspect of the CRISPR Capsules project. From wet lab work to speaking at public events, each team member has experience in all fields. Though some of us certainly deem ourselves “specialized” in some tasks, we find that the overall contribution from the high-level development of the project to the technical details of lab troubleshooting constitutes efforts from each member of the team.

Sara Boyle
SENIOR
Neuroscience
Sara Boyle
From early childhood, I’ve always loved knowing exactly how everything works. Around the age of five, I realized that the questions that were the most interesting were the ones my parents didn’t know the answer to, so I gave up on my dream of being an artist-veterinarian-doctor and decided to become a mad scientist.
Now I am a senior studying neuroscience and cognitive science with a minor in computer science and am quite content. My interests include playing violin and reading books, but mostly brains.
Jordan Harrison
SENIOR
Biology
Jordan Harrison
I hail from eastern North Carolina but called my residential STEM high school in Durham, NC home and ignited my interest in life sciences there. My family and friends have done a fun DIY science experiment on every Labor Day since I was born.
I am a fourth year biology major with a plant biology concentration. I first spent a year and a half in the Medill School of Journalism and predictably have a passion for science communication. My personal research interests are in sustainability and plant circadian rhythms. My dream is to write for National Geographic.
Paul Perkovich
SENIOR
Chemical Engineering
Paul Perkovich
I am a senior chemical engineer pursuing a minor in biotechnology. I have previously been involved in research developing a surface-based microfluidic bioreactor.
I love learning new things and frolicking in the cold snow while my friends complain about it. My interests include applying synthetic biology to sustainability, telling bad science jokes, and playing in the marching band.
Tasfia Azim
JUNIOR
Chemical Engineering
Tasfia Azim
I didn’t learn how to properly pronounce my name (Thushfia) until I was in third grade. But that was a dark time in the past. Today, I am a junior studying chemical engineering and pursuing minors in biotechnology and creative writing. You can say that I’m indecisive about my interests.
When I am not in the lab, I’m probably [crying in my apartment while] writing stories about mutant flying squirrels and consuming large volumes of apples and hazelnut coffee.
Michelle Cai
JUNIOR
Biomedical Engineering
Michelle Cai
I’m a junior pre-medical and Biomedical Engineering student, so I’m both bossy and boring, which I’ve found tends to work out really well in social settings. I’ve been interested in playing with biology ever since I learned as a child that jellyfish could use their bodies to produce light and poison people, neither of which I could do at 5.
At 19 I still can’t produce light or poison people, but my interests are a bit more benign now, so it isn’t such a disappointment. I am particularly interested in gerontology, end of life care, and psychopathology, and on the lighter spectrum of things I enjoy rainy days, soft cookies, and ballet.
Sam Davidson
JUNIOR
Chemical Engineering
Sam Davidson
I have been interested in genetic engineering since I was 8, when I read a relevant article in a copy of TIME for Kids in the back of my grandma’s car on the way to go see a movie.
Since I never shut up about space and AI technology, my friends often wonder why I’m not pursuing one of those fields instead. If I were pursuing one of those fields, I’d probably never shut up about genetic engineering.
Shu Huang
JUNIOR
Chemical Engineering
Shu Huang
I am a junior majoring in chemical engineering, but I’m not fond of thermo. After learning about genetics and doing cloning experiments, I fell in love with synthetic biology and decided to pursue a biotechnology minor. (I’m always excited about running gels.)
When not in the lab, I’m probably playing with cats or watching Japanese anime.
Tyler Lazar
JUNIOR
Chemical Engineering
Tyler Lazar
My first name is actually John. The other John Tyler (the tenth president of the United States) died on January 18, which is coincidentally my birthday. A chemical engineer minoring in biotechnology and sociology, my research interests include antibiotic discovery, medicinal plant biology, and sustainability.
Outside of laboratory, I am a plant enthusiast who enjoys running in the mountains, sipping tea in San Francisco, and grappling with life’s mysteries.

MLP Team Building Day
Welcome to OPTOPTOSIS
Our group consists of 19 motivated undergraduate students, that came together in late 2015 to found the first iGEM Team of the Heinrich Heine University in Duesseldorf.  In 2015 we made it our goal, to create a new and innovative application for synthetic biology and become a part of the renowned iGEM competition.
Already in the early stage of the project it was definite that we would emphasize on creating a mechanism to fight one of the deadliest diseases in the world: cancer. On this page we will tell you how we approach this big goal.

MLP Team Building Day
After asking them for help with our project, we were kindly invited to attend a Career-Day as a team by MLP Düsseldorf. They wanted to help improve our skills in presenting ourselves, achieving results as a group, make decisions in a group in a fast and effective manner and generally help getting to know each other better and learn about the strengths of the other team members.
First, we invited them to come to one of our weekly meetings to learn about MLP and what they wanted to do for us. Two employees came to the meeting: Kenan Hadzihamzic and Dimitri Tzourmbakis. It was a very entertaining encounter and we immediately were very enthusiastic about their offer: To come visit them at the MLP-Branch in Düsseldorf to help us improve our soft skills.
Then, on a Saturday morning, we all arrived at our destination and were welcomed hearty at their office building by Kenan, Dimitri and an additional employee that we met: Branko Beljak.      At first, they helped us improve our ways of presenting ourselves, then we carried out an exercise to find an outcome as a short group in a short time efficiently: A situation, where we should choose the ideal candidate for a certain business was simulated. After that, a similar exercise was carried out but with a bigger group.
Finally, we took our lunch break: They bought pizza for the whole team! We had a very relaxing and nice time chatting and playing table football against the employees.
After the break, we simulated a situation of a casino-trip, where we got to choose between an own big benefit or for the good of all: It was an exercise to test and improve our team spirit. We scored brilliant results, it was an important moment for all team members.
At the end, we evaluated the day and the benefit it has brought to us and our project; The feedback by us and the employees was highly positive and everyone profited from it.
Everyone that attended this Career-Day was given the chance to get some evaluation about their individual strengths and weaknesses and how to improve oneself based on that in a personal meeting with one of the three involved employees.
We are glad that they gave us the opportunity to attend to this highly effective career day and help us to improve our project!"

Attributions Our team consisted of 17 undergraduate students with 4 advisors and a PI. Our PI was fundamental in developing the idea for the project in conjunction with the rest of the team. The advisors were there in a truly advisory capacity; they did not perform any experiments. Instead, they guided us to the best way to carry out the work and taught us good engineering practices. They brought a wealth of knowledge and experience to aid us in our journey of conducting this project ourselves.
Advisors
Logan Mulroney offered protocol advice and taught us how to run different experiments. He has also worked with UCSC iGEM teams in previous years and helped us avoid pitfalls and ensured we were on track.
Brandy Baird helped train us on different experiments and organized people doing lab work. She and her mother were also responsible for getting us amazing embroidered jackets.
Roger Volden participated in iGEM the previous year and came on as an advisor to help this year’s’ team. He helped teach us how to conduct different experiments and emphasized good engineering practices.
Wade ""Simba"" Khadder helped teach people how to build a website and made sure we were constructing it in an efficient way.
Artwork
We would especially like to thank two team members, Sarah and Jasmine, for designing and digitizing our banana slug and gear logo. We would also like to thank Ian Santos Photography for filming and editing our beautiful crowdfunding videos that enable us to raise enough money to send the entire team to Boston. We would like to thank Tanvir Saini for help with learning wiki formatting.
Team Training and Preparation
Our institution teaches a 2 unit iGEM course in Spring Quarter. A majority of the team members participated in this course prior to starting work in the summer. The purpose of this course is primarily team building exercises. We started brainstorming for the lab in this class through journal clubs and discussions. The course description is:
“This is a seminar course where students develop a research proposal and the collaborative skills needed for independent research projects. The course will include professional practice development in collaboration skills, project management, proposal development, and funding. The course provides skills in project management and teamwork for small (4) to mid-size (12) engineering teams, focusing on BioEngineering. Skills and plans developed in this course are intended to improve the success and experience gained in subsequent Bioengineering capstone projects (prerequisite for BME 188 and recommended for BME 123A). Students will work in small teams with the goal of producing a project plan that includes both a fundable project and a capable team for their Engineering capstone.”
The physical research started in the middle of June and was conducted in the teaching lab, provided by the Department of Bioengineering at UCSC.
We are also very grateful to the following sponsors who donated money, supplies, or both."

Captains 
Hannah Meyers
Co-Captain (Bioinformatics and Software)
Secretly she is at least half banana and three-quarters Santa Cruz native. While iGEM is          happening, Hannah participates in extreme sports and weightlifting. Her          max squat is rumored to be 600 pounds. It is hard not to like Hannah.          She may not know Monty Python, but she knows python programming,          which involves subduing code, trapping it, and slowly crushing it as          her instincts kick in. Hannah does not need to eat for weeks after a          successful coding but still may become highly aggressive if she senses          code nearby. Thing #1 of the blonde triplets.
Spirit Animal: Banana Python.
Pavle Jeremić
Co-Captain (Genetic and Metabolic Engineering)
Pavle [Pahv - lay]: man, machine,    alien, spiritual enigma; we   do not know the true origin of this    being. What we do know is that much like aquaman, he has the ability to    summon Serbian sea creatures (even though Serbia is landlocked). Is    known to incorporate Serbian into his every day speech when he gets too    excited. Doing research since high school, Pavle has an instinct for    engineering that is a sight to behold. Known to work long into the    night, he often forgets sleep is necessary, even though it may not be    for this Serbian wonder child. Thing #2 of the blonde triplets.
Spirit Animal: Elon Musk.
Bioelectronics Team 
Henry Hinton
Bioelectronics Team Lead
Commander in chief of electronics. Henry Hinton, talks very smoothly and eloquently, especially    when he puts his teaching voice on. We must assume that he was bestowed    with magical German powers as a young child. Henry’s power is the     ability to hear with superhuman accuracy, allowing him deep insights     into the musical realm (as well as a weakness to    dog whistles). Often found working hard into the night as a DJ, Henry     is also fond of da bass, even if he often drops it. Henry’s true talents    lie in electronics, and the complex network of design involved in their    creation. An inductive lad, Henry has a large capacitance for helping     others, and a strong resistance to passing out so long as his electric     passion is well grounded to the rails of an unsolved problem. Thing #3     of the blonde triplets.
Spirit animal: Oscilloscope.
Lon Blauvelt
Normal Person
Bio: N/A
Metabolics & Wet Lab Team
Giordan Kitts
Metabolics Team Lead
Born and raised in Kailua, Hawaii, “Guy-ordan” has      yet to be convinced that he doesn’t know how to spell his own name.      Whether he’s getting ambitious on a skateboard or with his thoughts      towards microbes, he always is making big breakthroughs in the project      or in his arm. While pursuing his interests in science, Giordan enjoys      hikes, bike rides, and extreme skating. Armed with his thoughts, and one     broken arm, Giordan is a highly motivated member of iGEM.
Spirit animal: B. subtilis.
Christian Snyder
When asked what the most important thing he       could bring to the team was, he said his love of learning--and learn he       does. When not furiously researching bacterial chassis and metabolic       pathways, Christian can be seen playing a wholesome game of Tetris, with      skills unparalleled by anything we have ever seen. Christian describes       his happy place as working in lab, and has ridiculous hobbies like       rocket engineering. Always a team player, he has been known to run miles      beside his friends without a word of complaint, while they cheerfully       biked along.
Spirit animal: Eagle Owl.
Riley Mahn
He is the Mahn. A person of many facets, while his        clothes say he knows how to have a good time, his eyes say he loves math       (even has a minor in it) and a good chess game. A third generation        pluot farmer, Riley has never tasted another fruit, because he does not        know they exist. Riley’s parents always wanted him to sell pluots, and        tiny Riley did as he was told... until he discovered math. Addiction to        math is harmless some argue, but it is a gateway to engineering, in        which Riley partakes every day. Riley goes out each morning, telling his       parents he is selling pluots, but he is secretly in school and taking        engineering classes and the farm is in danger.
Spirit Animal: Skateboard.
Jasmine Dioguardi
A cheerful         Earth girl, Jasmine loves to draw, bringing out the slow spiral of         inevitable secrets we each sought to conceal. Chortman’s inner desire         for villainy. Henry’s fear of glass. Pavle’s spaceship. Lon’s tie dye         pants. One can only imagine her gifts for guitar, photography, listening        to music, and adventuring are equally dangerous. Our resident artist,         her and Sarah are the wonderful creators of all things logo and design,         and without them we would certainly be lost in a world of boring stick         figures and uninspired emblems. Jasmine’s constant adventuring has led         to her entrapment in the belly of iGEM, and her only escape is to         engineer her way out.
Spirit animal: Sea Otter.
Sarah Cligher
Sarah is secretly an electronics enthusiast. She may seem quiet, but Sarah is secretly looking for talent to help her complete her iron man suit, which currently can only travel far enough to get away from the team, no matter how much we want to see it or ride in it. Our resident photoshop guru, we have her to thank for rendering our wonderful banners and logos. Her amicability is unsurpassed, in that she had to put up with Hannah making her change every color a hundred times, but her bright smile and present demeanor never left.
Spirit animal: Rubik's Cube.
Miles Hobby
A Gentle Giant whose veins we suspect might pop at any moment. A follower of CruzFit and BodyBuilding.com, Miles has a muscle game that is on point. Soft-spoken and cheerful, we know Miles would run miles for the rest of his team. Does not ever sass his captains, even when Hannah tells him to learn how to build a wiki in a week. We are not certain if he ever sleeps, because the amount of time he dedicates to his team does not seem to allow for working out, yet his constant state of swole begs to differ.
Spirit animal: Wolverine.
Software Team
Austin York
Software Team Lead
Loves to laugh. Secretly may or may not be a 50 year old man. Hailing north county San Diego, his wetsuit tan is a force to be reckoned with. Always cheerful and with a smile on his face, Austin enjoys surfing, coding, and everything in the middle. Austin’s food choices are efficient above and beyond typical human food, consuming entire bricks of carbohydrates to fuel his empowering presence. His boyish energy is felt every morning as his grin lights us all with the magic of science. A cunning programmer, Austin makes HTML look easy (even though it’s not a real language). He built and resides in the dark corner of Jack’s Lounge that he has dubbed his 'office'.
Spirit animal: 50 year old man.
Colin Hortman
Colin is a senior bioengineer at UCSC.  He was set on bioengineering after taking an ethics class that opened his eyes to the research that was happening at UC Santa Cruz and around the country.  He enjoys programming on teams and mixing chemicals in the lab.  He is currently involved with the bioinformatics and operation teams; he hopes to work in the wet lab to gain more experience with biochem techniques.  In his free time he likes to bike with his friends and girlfriend.  Mountain biking is somewhat new to him but he is enjoying the world class trails found right at the top of campus.
Spirit animal: Mountain Bike.
Andrew Blair
Running through his native habitat, the forest, this modern day Pocahontas has taught us all about the colors of the wind. Pharmacy tech by night and aspiring engineer by day, Andrew provides a place of calm in the center of the storm that is the software team. His devilish tendencies emerge when people don’t let him go to bed at a reasonable hour, and has been known to cut router connections to his roommates/resident hooligans (don’t let them know though). The stars have aligned on our beautiful campus, as Andrew was born in the same hospital as another member of our software team, Austin. We’re still not convinced they aren’t related.
Spirit animal: Fawn.
Purification Team
Hailey Loehde-Woolard
Purification Team Lead
Hailey is our second resident Santa Cruz native. What she loves most (other than iGEM) is being surrounded by good company. She loves a good joke and will laugh at anything. Matter of fact, if she’s not laughing, check her vital signs to see if something is wrong… or look around for spiders. Hailey is a master swing dancer who also has started a weekly dessert adventure, Made With Erythritol. Rising sophomore at Georgia Tech, the banana slugs stole her for the summer and it is becoming increasingly less likely that we will let her go. Studying to be a Chemical Engineer so that she can leave the world in better shape than she found it. We know she will too.
Spirit animal: Georgia Tech.
Misa Macliesh
Hailing from mild, pleasant Sunnyvale, this free spirited human known as Misa to her friends likes puppies. She spends her time exploring and stargazing, occasionally retreating to her place of rest for video games and thai food. If she doesn't pick up your phone call, she's either adding more languages to her collection (English, Spanish, Japanese), or off riding her very red, dreamy motorcycle. This natural explorer is always seeking adventure, whether its climbing mountains or joining iGEM, she leaves no stone unturned.
Spirit animal: Taro Milk Tea (with strawberry stars).
Jon Aguinaga
Jon found his passion for environment science growing up in Riverside, CA: the Emerald Green City. Jon enjoys spending time in the forest where he can be alone with his thoughts. Jon is writing a book about what the world will turn into if we continue to degrade our resources and overpopulate as a society. He also likes to strum the banjo; iTunes songs pending. Jon’s addiction to music began when he first shaved his head and began to hear new and addictive sounds that only chosen beings can hear or withstand. Constantly attempting to engage us in the river of melodies continually flowing across his brain, his silence is only broken by profound thoughts that shake the foundation of the team when heard. When Jon speaks you better listen.
Spirit animal: Banjo.
Operations Team
Chase Armer
Human Practices Team Lead
His enchanting Irish accent woos any passerby caught in his wake… If you’re a Slackbot, Chase would love to have you in his group. Chase has a strong and large love for many hobbies, including organization, loving animals (he’ll babysit your cat if you ask nicely), and long talks at the beach. Chase’s soothing voice is like the ocean, drawing you in until you realize you’ve joined operations and there is no way out. Chase’s fresh boyish face is a constant boon to lift the spirits of the team like a beam of sunshine across your entire body. Make sure to make fun of him for not knowing the difference between jalapeños and pepperoncinis.
Spirit animal: Tiger.
Principal Investigator
Dr. David Bernick
Words cannot express his dedication to our team. Like a Kung Fu master, his collection of people grows by the year to include various rare forms which he induces (with an endogenous promoter) to join him in his holy fight for humanity. Defeating evil itself in battle is his one passion, and the fire that lights his eyes as throws us forward into the fray of iGEM. He abandoned the tech industry in order to teach, and we are forever grateful for his commitment to his students.
Spirit animal: Halophile.
Advisors
Brandy Baird
A bit of a world traveller and rambling spirit, Brandy returned to school after already finding great success in the world of business. She brings wisdom to the team that we only hope will rub off on us by the end of the summer. With a fondness for adventure and risk taking, she projects a bright and cheery façade but has a passion that continues to drive her success in the scientific community.
Spirit animal: Good food.
Roger Volden
Our resident advisor from last year’s team, Roger is a force of nature when it comes to wet lab. One of the only people to complete the Bioengineering curriculum in three years, he is on his way to a Ph.D. while the rest of us are standing around wondering why we’re still working on our undergraduate degrees and being advised by someone that can’t even legally drink.
Spirit animal: Velociroger.
Logan Mulroney
Is fond of tearing people’s ideas apart and then putting them back together, as only the best advisors do. Has graciously donated his time and materials in our pursuit of figuring out this crazy thing called iGEM.
Spirit animal: Monarch Butterfly.
Wade 'Simba' Khadder
If you remember little Simba from The Lion King, he grew up to be a bigger human. He has a better understanding of technology and our coding world - they both have bushy beards though. He enjoys longboarding and raspberry pi, at the same time. He is a pro lion wrestler, almost went hardcore. But be careful, he is part hyena and will laugh at you if you trip in front of him. Sometimes when Simba is bored, he will put oranges on his face. Don’t ask, just accept. When Simba sees you lagging, he’ll ask you to Mufasa. Hakuna Matata.
Spirit animal: Delicious zebras."

I. Starting the team:
The 2016 iGEM team BNDS_China was established first by Yunpeng Li and Zhongxiu Hu. Then the two of them send the information of this competition available to students in the International Department of Beijing National Day School. After several meetings, the final twelve members of the team (see the team information page) has confirmed.
The registration fee was first paid by Jiangyun Hu (Zhongxiu Hu’s father) and collected as twelve subunits from all members.
II. Finding the Principle Investigators and advisor:
The information of the iGEM competition was also distributed to all the faculties in Beijing National Day School. The Biology teacher, Xiaoling Yao, who has majored in Molecular biology for more than ten years, was very interested in guiding a high school team of iGEM 2016.
Our secondary Principal Investigator is David Brackett, who teaches Chemistry at Beijing National Day School. He used to be the instructor at Portland Community University with condensed researching experience.
Xiangmei Dou is our team advisor who lent us her own lab. She is the teacher who in charges of researching projects at the national department of the school.
III. Deciding the project:
The team was formed around April. Started from April to June, team BNDS_China holds a meeting session every week. Their Principal Investigator Xiaoling Yao and David Brackett has given all team members about the basic information of molecular biology. After acquiring a reasonable amount of knowledge, the team started their process of choosing the topic. Every member of the team has taken part in the discussions and all decided to choose the bacterial hard water softener as the project of BNDS_China.
IV. Conducting the experiment
Stucking from getting the kit and the gene, the team officially started their experiments in late August, where many other teams have already finished their project or at least half of them. At first, coming to the lab is not arranged in a formal schedule and people come to the lab whenever they wanted. However, the consequence of this policy creates an issue of really low efficiency. Then the team leader assigned tasks for different students for the time left (October 10-22). Zhongxiu Hu, Yuanyi Xu, Longyin Wang, Ziqi Wang, Yunpeng li, Hao Yu, Xin Luo, Tianlin Zhao are put into groups and work for two days each. The whole project was connected by Zhongxiu Hu who sent lab notes to team members.
V. Wiki design
Hongliang Xiong and Yifei Yao contributed to the team by writing the style of the team wiki. They had studied html, css, and java script by themselves in their spire time. The first draft of the wiki was written by Yuanyi Xu, Longyin Wang, Yunpeng Li, Yifei Yao, Hongliang Xiong, Zhongxiu Hu. Hongliang Xiong, Yifei Yao, Zhongxiu Hu, and our Principal Investigator, Xiaoling Yao, edited the final version of the wiki.
VI. Teachers' helps
Xiaoling Yao is the person who always took the same challenges with us. Not only instructing about molecular biology experiments, she acts as our model of a responsible researching conductor. When we have failed and depressed, we saw hopes from her encouragements and kept working on the project.
David Brackett is the person who always has solutions to the problems we met in the competition. He has lots of valuable suggestions that we can apply.
As for our advisor Xiangmei Dou, she guided us in a more general way. She kept reminding us of the importance of maintaining a clean and comfortable lab.
Acknowledgements: people to remember
I. Collaborations
Collaborating with other teams has made the whole iGEM experience more intriguing. Team UCAS and team SDSZ_China have enlightened us experimenting and attending the Giant Jamboree,while team CIEI-BJ gives us an opportunity of having a better experimenting environment.<.p>
II. Contacting with iGEM Head Quarter (iGEM HQ)
Contacting with iGEM HQ has solved our problem of kit distribution and changing members. Every email sent by the iGEM HQ has given us hints to what should we do. Without their helps, we will miss uncountable deadlines and innumerable connections with the iGEM society, which are so important for new teams such as us.
III. Families and friends
Helps from relatives and friends play another important role in our project.
Professor Yeguang Chen and his post-graduated student Xuanhao Xu (Zhongxiu Hu’s tutors during her 2015 Science Talent Project) have given valuable advices due to the experiment results as well as inspiring the team with fantastic ideas for free.
The post-graduated student Tianyue An at the Institute of Botany, the Chinese Academy of Sciences has also given generous helps with improved protocols.
Haohuan Wang (a relative of Yuanyi Xu) who is specialized in computer science had given valuable suggestions and directions of javascripts designs.
IV. Financial support
In order to keep our research project going on, Ms. Natalie Jonk from Walacea (a crowdfunding website) has helped us to achieve the funding goal and given us useful information of how to make people attention to your work. (See more information on the page of Human Pratice)
The application Qing Song Chou (A Chinese crowd funding platform) also helped us to get financial supports not only from parents and friends, but also supports from warm-hearted strangers.
Without any of the people above, we are not able to make our project."

Hello, my name is David Brackett, and I’m the Advanced Placement chemistry teacher at Beijing National Day School, as well as the secondary PI for the BNDS-China iGEM group.  I received my doctorate degree in chemistry from the University of California, Davis, where I studied the physical characteristics and spectroscopic properties of an RNA aptamer interacting with small molecules.
After my doctorate degree, I was a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Washington in the department of Biochemistry.  I investigated the alternative splicing of the Fmr1 gene in mouse brain, a gene that causes moderate to severe mental retardation in humans.
Prior to joining Beijing National Day School, I was a professor of chemistry at Portland Community College in Portland, Oregon.
Xiangmei Dou is our advisor and also a biology teach at Beijing National Day School. She got her PhD at Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Science. In recent years, Doctor Dou has published several articles on Biology Teaching and Bulletin of Biology.
I am Xiaoling Yao, the primary PI of BNDS_China. I have been teaching in the international department of Beijing National Day School for more than two years. My background is molecular biology focusing on metabolism pathways. The kids in BNDS are smart and creative. I really like working with and teaching them. They have great ideas in igem project and they worked extremely hard to make it become true. And the problem we are going to solve is so important and practical.
Hi, I am Zhongxiu Hu. I am an eleventh grader from Beijing National Day School. This year, I am the Team Leader of BNDS_China. Being a synthetic biologist is always my dream. (Sometimes I just want to sleep in the lab.) Art is also another giant part of my life. More than dancing and music, I love every form of it.
I’m Yingwen Guo, a senior student from Beijing National Day School. I plan to study environmental science in the future and put effort in environment protection, so it’s a great pleasure for me to participate in the iGEM competition with a team aiming on produce soft water more efficiently. I enjoy the time either doing the lab or having team discussion, when we donate our effort in solving environment problems. Moreover, this competition provides me the opportunity to study the knowledge out of the book and it gives me the chance to meet a group of excellent scientists. It is so lucky for me to be part of the iGEM, and I hope what we do can really help the world.
Hi! I am Alban (Li Yunpeng). I should say I am a researcher of this team. Basically, I enjoyed the time in lab, because I like to be involved in a research program. Though this is not the first time, it is the most meaningful experience to me because we are doing a lot of things on our own for our own topic. Things really get different when we are doing things for ourselves. While doing all the experiments, I like the sense of expectation, waiting for the results, and hoping everything had and would go well.
I’m Andy (Luo Xin) from BNDS A-level program. I’m in my third year of high school. My job in our team is to suggest a topic and engage in lab activities. By joining this team, I aim to learn some basic lab skills and understand how a synthetic biology experiment is done. The time I got to know synthetic biology was in my second year in high school. At that time, I heard a Canadian high school student had synthesized a special type of bacteria, enabling it to clean up plastics waste in a river. I was amazed by how conveniently the problem was addressed and that using synthetic biology to solve problems is not too complicated, for a high school student at least. I soon realized that synthetic biology was a great tool to solve problems in environment, energy and healthcare. I believe it still has many untapped potential and my goal in the future is to develop it and makes it a common tool to solve not only big problems but our daily problems as well.
Greetings, everybody! I’m Michael Wang from Beijing National Day School Grade 11, international program. I feel grateful to be a member of our school’s IGEM team and to discover a brand new method correlates to water purification. As a passionate worker I am in charge of going through the actual experiment and practical methods. I have learnt a lot from my teammates, our team mentor as well as some other students who shared the same interest of the topic as I do. I am pretty confident that our team can accomplished our task through our hardworks!
Hello, my name is Wang Ziqi. I am a 12 graders in Beijing National Day School. I have studied biology for over three years, and I really love this subject. The intention of my doing iGEM competition was to brainstorm as much as possible and to learn more technologies which I didn’t get chance to study on. There are many talent students in my team, so I have learned a lot from them as well. After doing iGEM for few months, I think I am more erudite. I gain lots of knowledges about lab, for example, I know how to make LB medium, how to do the electrophoresis, etc.. As far as I am concerned, studying in a lab can nurture not only our scientific knowledge, but also our manual dexterity and ability. Therefore, I really encourage others to come and attend this competition if they want. I think iGEM helps me a lot.
Hi, I’m Ellen Yuanyi Xu from Beijing National Day School Grade 12. I’ve taken Biology for 2 years and it’s so glad for me to participate iGEM competition with my wonderful teammates. I enjoy the moment of staying in the lab for hours and come up with a successful result! Doing the project teaches many new things outside textbook, and I can demonstrate Biological concepts that used be vague and far away from me. Working with my brilliant teammates offer me a chance to learn more and I really appreciate the moment we spend together. I’m pretty sure we will achieve our goals in iGEM!
Hi! I am Daniel (Xiong Hongliang). I am a 11th grade student from Beijing National Day School. My responsibility in the team is to set up the team wiki page and construct the model of the protein ORAI1 V102A. This competition provided me a great opportunity to extend my ability and expand my view. During the competition, I learned more webpage editing techniques. Also, I met more outstanding people while learning from them, making my interpersonal communication skill improved a lot. Besides my competition, I enjoy playing the piano in my spare time. I also play few kinds of sports as of interests. But mostly I am interested to study in biology or computer science.
Hey guys, this is Yao Yifei (or call me Jason if you wish so), the so called “tech guy” in the team. I’m in charge of building and styling the wiki site that you are looking at right now, and……that’s all. I’m really glad to be a part of this IGEM team because I hold a strong interest in biology. I mean, although I don’t want to major in it in the future, but isn’t it interesting to develop a new kind of bacteria that has special effects like softening water? It’s like playing the role of God. Of course I learned a lot from my teammates as well, like a lot of fundamental knowledge about DNA replication and PCR and things like those. This is a beneficial experience for me, and I really enjoy the time I spent with my teammates.
Hi! This is Eva, Yu Hao, from Beijing National Day School Grade 11. I believe that we should continue learning throughout our lives, and this IGEM experience has brought me into a really exciting world of biology. I saw for real how lives, from bacterias to human, can be so different, and learned lots of things from my teammates, who taught me how to collaborate with others and face both the success and the failures.
Hello there, this is Isaac (Zhang Yuxuan) from Beijing National Day School. As a senior, I have decided what to do when I am in college, I want to be an engineer and the experience in IGEM has helped me a lot. I appreciate all of the teachers and co-workers not only for their effort on this project but also for leading me to a whole new world of genetic engineering. Hopefully, I will take advantage of the knowledge I have got and help the project to move forward. By the way, people appraise me because I did some fine artwork for the project. The prototype of the team logo was made by me, and I am proud of it too.
Zhao Tianlin is an eminent student outstanding for his ability of recognizing details. He is one of the members of the experimenters for his cautiousness and has a strong eagerness to understand every processes of the experiment so that the team can stick to its goals without being influenced by unrelated evidences. During the experiment, he can always provide his teammates a suitable condition for experiments and verifies the result by checking if there is malfunctioning of the machines. Without him, this team is definitely incomplete for the lack of a supporting character."

Everyone brings what he or she has learned into full play. After interdisciplinary brainstorming for several months, we hope to contribute to the society and world by providing another possibility of adjuvant during the iGEM project.
Instructor
Sponsors
iGEM is a highly-cost competition, so that we have no choice but to go around canvassing and collect requisite capital for iGEM. There are four parts in our total budgetary, including registration fees, experimental costs, transportation & living expenses, and others. Our project will require extensive DNA work and large-scale antibody test. The required reagents count significant cost to our budget; the actual cost varies depending on the results and progress. Any remaining funds will go towards being used in personal registration fees to MIT (USA) Jamboree where we present our project, and living expenses later.
At first, we think how we could get subsidized by others? Then we wrote request letters for small donations and emailed them to the faculty of Chang Gung University and thousands and hundreds of biotech-associated or –unassociated companies. In the letter, we described, “your small donation will do help us achieve our goals and support the CGU iGEM team in the years to come. The desire to win glory for Taiwan impels our team to work more diligently. Finally, we are going to contribute to the world by our ultimate outcome.”
Additionally, we participated in the plenitude of seminars, lectures, and exhibitions, like Joint Annual Conference of Biomedical Science in Taiwan and numerous academic seminars held in the CGU, so that we could have a direct contact with managers or agents of the companies to ask them for assistance.

(Calcitonin Hyper Expression using E.Coli in Space Exploration)
What is Osteoporosis?
How does loss of bone density occur?
How does this occur in astronauts
Current Treatments
Our Project
Long term space flight is quickly becoming technologically possible, however the limiting factor will soon be the human body’s ability to survive the flight.l. Space exploration takes a toll on the human body and comes with many risks. A major health issue that arises with space exploration is Osteoporosis.
What is Osteoporosis?
Osteoporosis, more commonly known as brittle bone disease, is a condition that causes the bone to become more porous due to a decrease in bone density. This results in the bone becoming more fragile, which can increase the risk of bone fracturing [1]. Studies have shown that the human body not being under the influence of gravity causes the bones to lose density at a rate of over 1% per month.  The elderly on Earth lose bone density at a rate of 1-1.5% per year, so a new and more efficient treatment is sorely needed in both circumstances [2].
How does loss of bone density occur?
Calcitonin is a hormone that strongly inhibits Osteoclast function. Osteoclasts are involved in the breakdown of bone into calcium, whereas Osteoblasts increase bone density [3]. The parathyroid hormone inhibits Osteoblast function and stimulates the activation of Osteoclasts. Calcitonin opposes the effects of this by lowering calcium levels via suppression of Osteoclast function and stimulating Osteoblasts [3].   After the age of 35 years, the ageing process occurs which results in difference in levels of Osteoclasts and Osteoblasts. This results in loss of bone density. This change in the bones results in the bones becoming more fragile in old age and the risk of fractures becoming more common, additional effects occur, such as the increased risk of kidney stones, due to the elevated levels of calcium in the bloodstream.
How does this occur in astronauts?
The answer is simple: lowered gravity. A typical space mission forces astronauts to endure three fields of gravity, all with different strengths: the travel to the destination is where astronauts are weightless. On the surface of their destination, the gravity acting upon the body is far less than as if you were on Earth, and finally when you return to Earth, the body has to readapt to the gravity here [4]. The body is constantly adjusting to suit its environment, this means that when in an environment where there is a reduced gravitational field, it adjusts, in this case the stress that bones normally go through every day supporting our bodies is reduced/ removed. This means the body does not need the bones to be as strong, and so reduces the bone density. This becomes a problem when transitioning to an environment that has a stronger gravitational field than your body has adapted to, say when astronauts return to Earth after a long time in space. The changes that the body has to go through in order to adjust itself to each situation causes bones to lose density at over 1% per month[4]. Even though when astronauts return to Earth they go through rehabilitation, there is a risk that bone loss may not be fully corrected, therefore astronauts are at greater risk of Osteoporosis-related fractures in the future.
Current Treatments
The most common treatment for Osteoporosis is calcitonin, however it is not very efficient for space travel due to weight.
Calcitonin is usually administered in 2 ways: orally or via a nasal spray. The calcitonin used in both methods are from salmon. Although it can be effective, there is a 50% difference in the protein sequence between human and salmon calcitonin, this could mean that the salmon analogue is not as effective, also, salmon calcitonin is known to cause nausea and vomiting [5]. Furthermore, calcitonin nasal sprays are ineffective and slow acting while oral administration does not work effectively as the peptide needs to be absorbed into the bloodstream in order to work properly [5].
Our Project
We planned to use the CRISPR associated protein 9 (Cas9) protein, however it is a mutant, and is known as dCas9 targeted to the human Calcitonin promoter region in order to increase and decrease the expression of downstream elements. The dCas9 has a mutation in amino acid 840 causing the substitution of an alanine, this mutation cause the Cas9 to be unable to cleave DNA, instead the dCas9 will bind to the DNA and remain there until it is removed. To target the dCas9 to the promoter region we are using synthetic gRNAs, these are short scaffolds of RNA that have the complementary sequence to your target site. We designed 2 gRNAs targeted to a similar region of the calcitonin promoter,with complementary sequences 20 base pairs long, as this was the recommended length.
It would be technically very complex to assay the production of calcitonin in the E.coli, so therefore we decided to insert the calcitonin promoter into a GFP reporter setup, this comprised of the same elements in each track, but in different orders

The 2016 UCLouvain iGEM Team is composed of twelve students from our bioengineering, engineering and biology schools and two biology professors. Come and meet the team ...
Adrien Gauchet :
Adrien is a master student in bioengineering in chemical and bio-industry. In his field, he loves everything about catalysis systems and chemical reactions. Then, he’s certainly our chemist (our own Heisenberg) and our glucose syrup master (show him some respect). Thanks to him we have had the opportunity to grow our bacteria on a homemade media. Adrien will also be our GO (literally “Gentil Organisateur” = Nice Organizer) for our trip to Boston. By the way, he’s the french one of the team but certainly the most belgian of all the french expatriates. He would certainly be the one to come at our team’s meeting a bit tipsy.
Adrien in one song ? Surely, “Quand l’appétit va, tout va !” (Astérix et Obélix, Mission Cléopâtre)
Alexandre Mattenet :
Alexandre is a master student in civil engineering in computer science. His task in the Team is the wiki support! He has an incredible sense of design. Listening and playing some music with nothing else than a GameBoy and drawing at any time, this guy does real ART. For him the answer will always be 42.
Alex in one song ? Surely, ‘Nyan Cat’ (Tosh 8.0)
Antoine Godeaux :
Aaaah, the God!! Antoine is a master student in biology, but he’s our god. When he speaks everyone listens. For every situation he will give you some wonderful punchlines such as “We all make mistakes” or “Trust no one”. He likes when everything is straight and right. The God has a lot of experience in biology and he has huge ambitions for his future. He’s the one that makes a Skype for an internship on the other side of the globe while making some experiments in the lab at the same time.
Antoine in one song? Surely, “Downtown” (Mackelmore and Ryan Lewis).
Benjamin Devreux :
Benjamin is a master student in bioengineering in chemical and bio-industry. To put it simply, Benjamin will always disagree with you. Why ? Just to bother you, of course. He loves to grumble on everyone and about everything. But in reality when he makes something, he makes it right. For iGEM, he’s ready to make more than 150 petri dishes to make you happy. And thanks to him, we can explain our project to everyone with a simple but efficient video.
Benjamin in one song ? Surely, “Beat it” (Michael Jackson).
Damien Fivet :
Damien is a master student in bioengineering. Damien is clearly the father of the team. During hard moment, he’s the one that you send to negotiate with your opponent. He’s always calm and peaceful. Furthermore, Damien is the one who has a calendar in his hands, reminding you all the things to do and when. Without him, we would never have done anything in a timely manner.
Damien in one song ? Surely, “Hold that tiger” (The swing ninjas).
François Tyckaert :
François is a master student in biology. He is our DNA sequencing expert. He is also the redhead of the team (well, one of them). He has plenty of explanations for your lab’s problems… Maybe too much but never mind that, it’s often quite useful for the rest of the team.
François in one song? Surely, “Bare necessities” (The Jungle Book)
Grégory Godefroi :
Grégory is a master student in bioengineering. To describe him in few words, he is a hard worker. Ready to work a lot, at all time of the day or night. He’s also a true master in chemical physics field, or maybe not. Ask him, you’ll see. Grégory was also the guy who forced us to go outside (not for pleasure or to enjoy the sun, just to catch some pokemons ;) ).
Grégory in one song ? Surely, “Gotta catch em all” (Pokémon)
Joaquin Guzman :
Joaquin is a master student in biology. For us it’s Armando. He is the master of the lab… Well mostly during the afternoon, he is not a morning person ;). However, Joaquin will always be the guy with an answer to your question. He loves to explain everything, even the things that you already know. In a way, he’s the memory of the team.
Joaquin in one song? Surely, “Livin la Vida Loca” (Ricky Martin)
Kilian Dekoninck :
Kilian (or Kiki or Ki²) is a master student in bioengineering in chemical and bio-industry. He may be our team leader but for everyone he is the Texan guy of the team. You’ll better not expect to see Kiki outside of the lab even if he says he will come to have a drink. He is rarely in a bad mood, but when he is, you better not bother him. He made a wonderful job managing the team. He has impressive communication skills and brought us a lot of sponsorship with his huge address book.
Kiki in one song? “Like A Boss” (The Lonely Island)
Maxime Velings :
Maxime is a master student in bioengineering. Learning and gaining some experience in all the fields of the project, he found his way both in lab work and in social media. Always listening to some advices, he does his best to make sure that all things are all right … except at catching pokemon (need some iOS system upgrade ! :( )
One song for Max? Surely, “Viva la vida” (Coldplay)
Meredith Wouters :
Meredith is a master student in biology. Meredith makes her master thesis in the lab where we work. First, she was just curious about our project but finally she decided to join the team. She brings a lot of her molecular biologist’s formation to the project. Many times, she gave us some clues to move forward in our project. She’s essential to the team. Furthermore, she became the mother of the team...Well it’s simple, she’s the only “she” of the team, she had no choice.
Meredith in one song? Surely, “This girl is on fire” (Alicia Keys)
Pierre-Antoine Masscheleyn :
Pierre-Antoine or just PA (it’s easier) is a master student in bioengineering. He joined the project while he was in exchange program in Helsinki. What he likes to do in the lab is to remind you of all the basic biosafety procedures. His favorite game is telling you when your hands are no more sterile. PA is the kind of person who can participate in multiple projects (like iGEM) at the same time, he just likes to have a lot on his plate.
PA in one song? Surely, “I will wait” (Mumford and sons)
Prof. Bernard Hallet :
Bernard is one of the PI of the BBGM lab in Louvain-La-Neuve (Biochemistry, Biophysics and Genetics of Microorganisms). His work focusses on molecular mechanisms of DNA transposition and site-specific recombination.
Formation:
Master degree in Biology at UCL and PhD in bacterial genetics at UCL (Biology Dpt, Prof. J. Delcour). Postdoctoral training at the University of Oxford, UK (Biochemistry Dpt, Prof. D.J. Sherratt). Research associate at the FNRS, Lecturer at UCL since 2001.

Yubei Sun member of experimental group
Hello everyone, I’m Yubei Sun. Glad to meet you here. I joined HUST-China on December 2015 as a reserve member for experiment team, and now I’m a regular team member. During this time, I’ve learnt a lot about synthetic biology, iGEM, the efficient way of searching for information I need and the most important thing--teamwork. I really enjoy brainstorming when I participated in 2016 project conceiving process. Because on one hand, we were required to consult numerous articles, on the other hand, it gave us the chance to compose our ideas freely and logically. So what appeals to you to keep passion for iGEM for almost one year?

Our Team
Students | Advisors
Emma Finlayson-Trick
Microbiology and Immunology
My name is Emma Finlayson-Trick and I am a fourth year student at Dalhousie University majoring in microbiology and immunology and minoring in history. Last year was my first time on the Dalhousie iGEM team as ethics consultant and this year I am the president. I originally began university thinking that eukaryotic cells were the most fascinating things out there, and not to anger anyone who agrees with that statement, but I am now a prokaryote fan after learning about the many marvelous abilities and complexities of these curious cells. I hope to pursue a career as a clinical microbiologist and I am particularly fascinated in exploring antibiotic resistance.
Landon Getz
Microbiology and Immunology
My name is Landon Getz. I am an aspiring researcher and microbiology student at Dalhousie University. Having watched the iGEM team last year, and taking a few classes in synthetic biology, I decided I wanted to try my own hand at it. So here I am. My task with our iGEM team this year, with the help of Mackenzie Thornbury, is to sequence some 16S rRNA genes and discover what microbes are found in the gut of the porcupine. I am also the main web designer for this years team. I am looking forward to continuing our porcupine research and hopefully finding some interesting microorganisms in the process!
Mackenzie Thornbury
Microbiology and Immunology
My name is Mackenzie Thornbury and I am a fourth year Microbiology and Immunology student at Dalhousie University. I first heard about iGEM last year and was really interested in their project and also synthetic biology as a whole. We have very little classes that focus on synthetic biology so I joined the team in order to learn new techniques and see what synthetic biology was all about.
Shayne Gracious
Chemistry and Mathematics
My name is Shayne Gracious and I am entering my third year at Dalhousie completing my undergraduate degree in chemistry with a minor in mathematics. I was first exposed to the concept of genetic engineering in my first year of undergraduate studies through the Dalhousie Integrated Science Program. Since then the topic has continuously peaked my interest particularly through recent progressive studies in CRISPR. As a chemist my main interests lies around the applications of synthetic biology in the field of chemistry, such as the use of enzymes to overcome challenging metabolic pathways or introducing new reaction mechanisms to produce complex molecules. I am excited to be part of the iGEM team this year!
Mostafa Hagar
Chemistry and Neuroscience
My name is Mostafa Hagar and I'm finishing up fourth year at Dalhousie University, double majoring in chemistry and neuroscience. A really good friend of mine (Paul) participated in iGEM last year and recommended I look into it. I first got interested in synthetic biology after reading a few chemistry papers where organic chemists used enzymes to synthesize their targets. I think it's really cool that we can use enzymes to do the same transformations that chemists go through a lot of effort to achieve, and I'm really excited to get more exposure to that kind of biology and understand how people work with these enzymes.
Nicholas Boudreau
Microbiology and Immunology
My name is Nicholas Boudreau. As of this coming fall I will be a second year microbiology student at Dalhousie university. I am studying to become a researcher in the field of viral gene-therapy. As one of the most novice members of this team, my primary role is to help other team members where needed as well as use my proficiency in JavaScript to design some aspects of the website. I will be contributing heavily to the Shubenacadie Microbiome Map. I also used my proficiency in JavaScript to help create the team’s webpage.
Maxine Kirschenbaum
Chemistry
My name is Maxine Kirshenbaum and I’m in my final year of undergrad at Dalhousie university, majoring in chemistry and minoring in biology. Genetic engineering is a controversial topic and iGEM provided the perfect opportunity to learn more about it. My scant biology background helped feed my interest, as did the actual iGEM project itself. While I did not get to play with porcupines, just their poop, the unique learning opportunity and amazing team made for a great experience.
Angela Tsai
Medical Sciences
My name is Angela Tsai. I am a second year Medical Sciences student. I first heard about iGEM from my biology TA who had introduced genetic engineering to me. I believe synthetic biology would be a major part of medical development in the future, and that is why I want to explore more in this area. This year I will be helping out with graphic design and community projects.
Advisors
Dr. Zhenyu Cheng
Primary PI
My name is Dr. Zhenyu Cheng and I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Microbiology and Immunology at Faculty of Medicine, Dalhousie University. My lab has been focusing on the study of host-bacterial interactions. I completed my undergraduate study in 2002 at Wuhan University in China and then went to University of Waterloo in Ontario, Canada to pursue my graduate studies, under the supervision of Drs. Bernard Glick and Brendan McConkey. After obtaining my PhD degree in 2010, Zhenyu joined Dr. Frederick Ausubel’s lab in Boston for his postdoctoral position that is jointly appointed in the Department of Molecular Biology at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) and the Department of Genetics at Harvard Medical School. During my postdoctoral training, I received a Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) Postdoctoral Fellowship and a Banting Postdoctoral Fellowship from the Government of Canada, followed by a Tosteson Award from MGH. I started my own independent research lab at Dalhousie University, Nova Scotia in 2016 and I iam a Cystic Fibrosis Canada Marsha Morton Early Career Investigator.
Dr. John Rohde
Secondary PI
Hello my name is Dr. John Rohde and I am the founder of the Dalhousie iGEM team and one of the faculty advisors for 2016. With a diverse background in microbial genetics, I became interested in synthetic biology during discussions with undergraduates in the courses that I teach at Dalhousie. I received my training at University of British Columbia, Institut Pasteur, Duke Medical Center and The Samuel Lunnenfeld Research Institute in Toronto. I am currently on sabbatical leave at Institut Pasteur.
Dr. Lois Murray
Faculty Advisor
My name is Lois Murray. I earned my PhD in Microbiology at Dalhousie University and post-doc'd at the University of New South Wales in Sydney, Australia. In both of these positions I learned cell and molecular biology techniques that I use to further my research on regulation of development in yeast. Synthetic biology is fascinating to me in that it has led researchers to discover systems that we didn't know existed in bacterial cells and use them in interesting ways to ask important questions in other cell types. Working with the iGEM team is of interest to me because I like to be involved in guiding students as they pursue their research into areas of gene regulation. I am so amazed and impressed by our iGEM group members as each student brings an interesting set of skills and perspectives to thinking about this project. Team work and communication are the core to generating new ideas!
Jamie Cook
Graduate Advisor
My name is Jamie Cook and I am one of Dalhousie’s iGEM team mentors. I am a new master’s student at Dalhousie University, and I am interested in bacterial-host interactions. I just recently graduated from the University of New Brunswick in Fredericton with an honours degree in biology, concentrations in microbiology and molecular biology, and a minor Psychology. I am very interested in synthetic biology because I believe it is a greener method to produce chemicals compared to previous methods, which generated harmful by-products. I also find it fascinating how we can use bacteria such as E. coli, and use them as mini factories to generate desired chemicals.
Emily Lamoureux
Graduate Advisor
My name is Emily Lamoureux and I am finishing up the first year of my Masters in Pharmacology. I’m super pumped to part of the Dalhousie iGEM team as an advisor. My undergrad was in Microbiology and Immunology and I’m so happy to see a self-directed opportunity for undergrads in research! It’s a lot of fun to be involved with such a brilliant and motivated group of people, and I can’t wait to see what other teams bring to the Jamboree
Patrick Slaine
Graduate Advisor
My name is Patrick Slaine and I am in my second year now of my masters in microbiology and immunology. My undergrad was at the university of Guelph studying molecular biology and genetics (MBG) and I am very grateful to be apart of the team. This program gives an amazing opportunity for undergrads to create amazing techniques, which can result in impactful findings."

Here we are !
Here we are, we are OUC-iGEM. It has been 6 years since we first took part in iGEM in 2011. This time the team which is made up of 12 members pursues a more particular and creative aim. All the members met in May 2015 when we were unfamiliar with each other and knew nothing about synthetic biology. We struck to intergrate the related disciplines and during this time we became not only teammates but also good friends. We come from different colleges and have diverse specialties which ensure that we join our abilities and insights to make our goal clearer as efficiently as possible. All of us share one belief that our persistence and professional quality will guarantee the beauty of cistrons concerto.

The NEPTUNE Flow
Neptune abstracts a very intricate workflow to provide an intuitive experience for its user. Below is a detailed depiction of all of the components that are under Neptune's hood.
Each of BostonU Hardware Team's members played an integral part in the success of Neptune's development.
Liquid Flow Relations & User Constraints File | Shane McCormack
In order to increase accessibility of our tool (and microfluidics in general), a method for describing microfluidics in a few simple lines was formed! This standard consists of Liquid Flow Relations (or LFR), and the User Constraints File (or UCF). The LFR file is where the user describes the inputs, outputs, and tells of any operations which occur on those inputs and outputs. These operations are described as symbols on the LFR, but are informed by the UCF. The few lines of LFR are the only things needed to run a chip through Neptune; a sample UCF is provided with Neptune that can be fine-tuned, but will not need to be written in its entirety.
The UCF can be thought of as a library of microfluidic components where, once a component is defined, it will never have to be written again! In more detail, once a component is defined inside the UCF, all subsequent LFR files can utilize the symbol the component is linked to without redefining the details of the component. The UCF leverages the MINT standard of describing parametric microfluidics. This parametrization unlocks great potential in the rapid prototyping of designs, where one number can be changed in the UCF, and all subsequent designs will have the updated component! For example, if our fictional synthetic biologist Dr. Ali found that his mixer's bends were too short in length, with one number edit in the UCF he could fix every bend of every mixer in all of his designs thereafter! This is far more accessible than redrawing every bend by hand on AutoCAD.
μShroom Mapper | Shane McCormack
With the new facilitated design method of Liquid Flow Relations, a behind-the-scenes software tool was needed to interpret and translate the LFR and UCF into a functional MINT file. This task is fulfilled with muShroomMapper; muShroomMapper takes LFR and UCF as inputs, maps the LFR into a graph with the support of NetSynth, then informs that graph with the UCF. The informed graph is then translated into a MINT file, to be placed and routed to a blueprint for fabrication.
μShroom Mapper-Neptune Integration | Kestas Subacius & Shane McCormack
Liquid Flow Relation files and User Constraint Files greatly simplify the microfluidic design process. With the implementation of the LFR and UCF file types also came the development of uShroom Mapper, an algorithm that takes LFR and UCF file inputs and converts them into MINT file types. These file types and tools by themselves are incredibly useful, enabling researchers to specify more complex designs with greater ease. Unfortunately, alone these tools would be cumbersome and difficult to use for an inexperienced programmer.
Therefore we integrated the LFR and UCF file types into Neptune, and we integrated the uShroom Mapper algorithm into Neptune's backend libraries. To make these tools easy to use, we developed a sleek, simple and appealing user interface where LFR and UCF files can be edited and then sent to uShroom mapper for conversion to MINT. We also integrated a front end terminal that provides compilation feedback and throws errors when design rules are violated. All this to speak, we integrated uShroom Mapper with Neptune by sculpting a clean user interface that makes the design simple and efficient.
Fluigi-Neptune Integration | Kestas Subacius & Shane McCormack
After uShroom Mapper outputs a MINT specification of a microfluidic chip, designers can modify this file type to do fine-tuning and optimization of their design. A microfluidic designer can also opt to skip specification at the LFR level, and they can go right into designing a MINT file. This being said, MINT files are not the end of the pipeline, and this filetype must be converted to a microfluidic design schematic that can be used for fabrication.
Fluigi is a powerful algorithm that takes a MINT description of a microfluidic chip, and from this description it outputs a microfluidic chip design. This tool is analogous to a place and route tool for a circuit schematic, allowing for complicated designs to be specified and then realized. Fluigi takes in a MINT specification, and outputs design schematics in the form of SVG’s for CNC mill fabrication, and EPS files for photolithography.
We integrated the MINT file type, along with the Fluigi compiler into Neptune. As a standalone tool Fluigi can be pretty daunting to navigate, requiring shell scripting experience and a solid software background. We eliminated all difficulty from Fluigi by integrating Neptune as a user interface for Fluigi. Users can compile their MINT files through Neptune, and Fluigi will in turn provide the designer feedback in a console. Design errors and design status is all fed back to Neptune. All in all, we integrated Fluigi with Neptune, providing a robust and easy to use UI for editing and compiling MINT files.
Choosing Mechanical System | Zach Lasiuk
Analyzed the pitfalls and advantages of both the rack and pinion system as well as the piston rod system. In order to properly choose a system for Neptune, the overall goals of Neptune were called to mind: Low cost, easy to use, and modular. With these design goals in mind, the piston rod system was ultimately chosen to ensure accuracy, modularity, and the ability to dispense very small to very large amounts of liquid with a feedback control active.
Designing Electrical System | Zach Lasiuk
Focusing in on the overall goals of Neptune’s hardware (low cost, easy to use, and modular), the Arduino Mega was chosen to control Neptune’s hardware. Because Neptune is inherently modular to change with synthetic biologists needs, Neptune’s electronic control circuitry must be equally as modular and scalable. The electronic system is comprised of power inputs, stackable Arduino motor controller shields, an Arduino Mega, and various headers and capacitors to make the system respond appropriately.
Mapping Mechanical Motion & Constant Flow Rate Equation | Zach Lasiuk
In order to accurately control Neptune’s hardware, the mechanical motion of the servo and syringe paring must be completely defined. Therefore, the equation for off-center piston-rod motion was derived. An inherent characteristic of the piston rod mechanical system is a non-linear response from the syringe pump being controlled. Based on where the servo arm is in its circular path of motion, the syringe pump will move different amounts with the same change in theta of the servo arm. This problem was overcome by developing an algorithm to ensure a constant flow rate is always achieved with Neptune given the specific values of the active servo and syringe, involving two lookup tables and linear extrapolation.
Modular Baseboard Implementation | Zach Lasiuk
The challenge of Neptune’s baseboard is to utilize a desktop CNC mill to achieve the functionality of a full machine shop. More specifically, Neptune’s baseboard must retain system expandability to arbitrary dimensions and maintain ease of use by providing places to auto-align components. This is done using an emerging standard in microfluidic hardware, the MEC board, developed by the GroverLab at University of California, Riverside. By creating these modular MEC squares that can be milled out one at a time and connected together. Neptune’s board can use a multitude of materials and even a combination of materials, currently tested with HDPE plastic, ABS plastic, and wood.
Created Parametric 3D Parts | Zach Lasiuk & Priya Kapadia
To ensure Neptune meets the requirements of any microfluidic experiment with different requirements for flow-rate and max volume to be dispensed, Neptune has completely parametric 3D parts. These parts hold and align the servo and syringe combination and enable the fluid motion of both. From 100mL to 10uL, Neptune’s 3D printed hardware will adjust in shape to accommodate different size syringes and servos to meet synthetic biologist’s experimental needs. While Neptune has tested servos and syringes on file to choose from by default, should a biologist need more volume to dispense or more precision in flow-rates they can input their own servo or syringe to obtain the exact response they desire. The final result is completely parametric 3D parts that adapt to a specific servo or syringe’s dimensions, enabling a massive amount of freedom for synthetic biologists in using Neptune.
Developed System Firmware | Zach Lasiuk
Reliability and repeatability of experiments are essential for Neptune to deliver results. The firmware developed for the Arduino Mega ensures these standards are met and maintained. Currently implemented, this firmware has the capability to work with both digital and analog servos, up to 13 servo shields stacked on top of the Arduino Mega (enabling the control of over 200 servos at once), control valves with instant motion, and control dispensers with variable flow-rates. In addition to working seamlessly with Neptune’s control page, there is another option to use the Arduino IDE should the need arise, retaining the ability to control both valves and dispensers.
Neptune's Specify Page | Kestas Subacius
Neptune’s “Specify” page is an integrated development environment for microfluidic chips designed through LFR. The “Specify” page was designed to encompass all parts of microfluidic design specification using LFR and UCF files, and this page is integrated with the uShroom mapper tool to convert designs to a MINT elaboration. In this IDE, users can define a microfluidic chip with specific inputs, outputs, and functionality. Designers can also define microfluidic chip parameters such as gradient generators, serpentine mixers and cell traps here. The Specify IDE provides a terminal for interfacing with uShroom mapper, and an editor for writing and editing files. This editor also provides syntax highlighting for LFR and UCF files, and error checking for improperly created files. Also, the Specify IDE has a user interface element for creating new microfluidic operators, making it very easy for designers to add new parts to their chip.
Neptune's Design Page | Kestas Subacius
Neptunes “Design” page is an integrated development environment for microfluidic chips designed through MINT. The “Design” page was created to encompass all the subtleties of elaborating a microfluidic chip using MINT files and configuration files. In this IDE, users can edit the fine aspects of their chip. A developer in this IDE has control over the sizing of each channel, port, valve and primitive in their design. Here users can also modify parameters related to how Fluigi compiles and outputs a design schematic. Parameters like chip dimensions are also defined in this section. The “Design” page also provides a visual preview the microfluidic design generated, allowing designers to see their chip layout as they modify their device. Design schematics generated on the “Design” page are immediately integrated with the build, assembly, and control sections of Neptune, allowing for clean navigation through the workflow.
Neptune's Workspaces | Kestas Subacius
Neptune was designed to be a easy-to-use desktop application. To this end, a file system had to be developed for Neptune that would allow for designers to store their designs locally on their computer, and to modify these designs through Neptune. Neptune was implemented like many other IDE’s, where designers can select workspaces on their computer, and any modifications they make to their designs happen locally. More importantly, these workspaces and this filesystem was implemented such that it will be expanded for cloud services in the future.
Neptune's Build & Assembly Pages | Priya Kapadia
After the user has designed the microfluidic chip, they can then move on to select hardware components to match their needs. They would need to first input the volume of liquid they would like to dispense, and the precision they require. Neptune would then search through its database of servos and syringes to recommend hardware combinations to the user based on complex calculations involving torque, the range of pulse-width modulations, the bandwidth-delay product, and so on. Consequently, users are provided with a large personalized list of items that they can choose from. The user can then map the hardware to the dispensers on the chip that they just designed. The mapping allows Neptune to calibrate the dispensers for the experiment. The user is then provided with an ordering list consisting of all the parts that they need for the experiment. The ordering list would include the new hardware that the user has just selected, some predetermined items such as a roll of 3D printing support, and also some variable items like the number of 6-32 screws for instance. These would be calculated using the user's choices and the chip at hand.
To ease the usage and to help the user put all the pieces together, Neptune's Assembly Page takes the user through a step by step process where they can make and connect all the pieces required to control the microfluidic device. Currently, the users can download all the file required to 3D print the infrastructure of the hardware we suggest to them in the Build page. However, moving forward, both the Build and Assembly page would allow for the user to input their own servo and syringe combination into Neptune. The ability for the user to create custom 3D printing files are currently in development. Aside from that, the Assembly page includes descriptions on how to create the infrastructure, mill out the microfluidic chip, connect the Arduino to the hardware, and set up the system for control.
Neptune's Control Page | Becca Wolf
Once users have milled out their microfluidic chip and assembled the supporting control infrastructure, he or she can control the valves and dispensers of their device through Neptune’s Control user interface. This interface displays a visual of their chip with controls to open or close valves, set a dispense rate for any given dispenser, or increment the dispensed liquid volume one unit of resolution at a time with only the click of a button. Through this page, a user may change the preset specs of each servo-syringe combination if he or she decides to change their setup. The control feature may be used to control any device using hardware formatted for use in Neptune regardless of the current project being designed to enable quick control adaption to different project environments. It is also through the control page that the user will establish connection to the arduino so that commands may be sent to pumps to operate valves and dispensers.
3DuF Integration | Becca Wolf
3DuF is a microfluidic design CAD tool which is part of a project led by Josh Lippai (see mentor section below for further details). We decided to leverage the JSON visualization features which 3DuF has to offer in Neptune to display a visual of the user’s chip for intuitive interaction with valves and dispensers on their microfluidic device in Neptune’s Control user interface. 3DuF is integrated into Neptune’s front end operation to this end. 3DuF’s version upkeep within Neptune is designed to handle the primitive features which are used in chip design bu Fluigi (see mentor section below) outputs.
Neptune-Arduino Integration | Johan Ospina & Becca Wolf
Neptune can be used to operate the valves and dispensers of a microfluidic chip through an Arduino Mega. In order to be able to send commands to the arduino to be interpreted and acted upon by firmware, Neptune opens a serial communication connection with the port the arduino is connected to. This is done quite simply by the user through the Control page and is as simple as selecting the port and pushing the “Connect” button. Neptune will then send commands specified by the user in the Control page to the arduino through UART.
Firmware-Neptune Integration | Zach Lasiuk & Becca Wolf
The way in which Neptune communicates to the Arduino Mega which powers the control of the microfluidic chip is standardized throughout the Neptune UI-firmware interaction. Commands are sent to the arduino through the Neptune Control page in the form of an 8-digit code where the first 4 digits indicate the index of the pin on the arduino which the servo-syringe combination is connected to, and the last 4 digits indicate a PWM value which indicates the position which the servo should rotate to.
Even Fluid Dispension-Neptune Integration | Zach Lasiuk & Becca Wolf
Integrated conversion of a set volume to dispense over time for dispensers in Neptune’s microfluidic devices are integrated into Neptune’s Software. A table of PWM and uL values at even intervals of fluid dispensing are generated and stored for each servo-syringe combination within Neptune to be used by the front end of the system to send dispense commands to the arduino. This can be done by the user through the Control page in an intuitive, pictorial way.
Neptune Packaging | Priya Kapadia
After creating Neptune as a web-application, the hardware team thought of packaging the entire application into a desktop application that the biologist could download onto his local computer. This would enable the user to use Neptune offline, making it more convenient. To do so, a packaging tool called Electron was introduced to host Neptune. This is under development, and moving forward, Neptune may become a desktop application that biologists can use anywhere and anytime.
Microfluidic Chip Prototyping | Shane McCormack
In order to ensure our design, build, and control workflow was functioning properly, we took designs through the Neptune workflow and tested them with mock experiments using colored water, or by collaborating with other iGEM teams to test biology inside our accessible microfluidic platform (checkout our collaborations page for more details on biology inside our systems!)
We stand on the shoulders of giants.
Our work would not have been possible without the foundations laid by our mentors. Neptune’s microfluidic design and fabrication tool leverages projects such as Fluigi Place and Route, Mint description language, MakerFluidics, and 3DuF in order to provide the most intuitive and cohesive experience for users. These projects have been built and expanded on by our graduate student mentors. We would like to thank our mentors for all of the work they have done to allow us to bring Neptune to life.
Fluigi | Radhakrishna Sanka
A place and route tool for microfluidic devices. Fluigi takes a MINT file as input and strategically routes the features specified in the MINT into an optimized microfluidic design. Fluigi outputs the design in a series of visual formats: SVG files (which can be used to mill out the different layers of the microfluidic chip using a CNC mill), a JSON file (which can be used to visualize the microfluidic design with 3DuF), and EPS files (which can be used to build the chip using photolithography if the user so chooses).
MINT | Radhakrishna Sanka
A microfluidic description language generated as an output of MuShroom mapper and used as an input to Fluigi. This language is used to describe the features of the specified microfluidic device in great detail including specification of feature shape, size and spacing.
Netsynth | Prashant Vaidyanathan
Netsynth is a software tool that was originally built by Prashant Vaidyanathan to translate Verilog logic descriptions into wire and gate lists. Netsynth has been modified for use in Neptune through a collaboration between Shane McCormack (BostonU_HW Team member) and Vaidyanathan to produce output formatted for interpretation in the context of microfluidic design. MuShroom mapper (a tool build by McCormack) uses this output alongside a variety of other inputs to produce a MINT file output in the Specify stage of Neptune.
3DuF | Joshua Lippai
A CAD-like drawing web application. 3DuF can be used to manually draw a microfluidic design if the user wishes to bypass high-level specifications. 3DuF will then output SVG files (for CNC milling layers of the microfluidic chip) and a JSON file for later visualization and editing purposes. When used in the context of Neptune, 3DuF is leveraged to visualize the JSON output of Fluigi so that the user may control his or her microfluidic device intuitively through the Neptune interface.
MakerFluidics | Ryan Silva
MakerFluidics is an accessible, inexpensive microfluidic fabrication technique used to manufacture microfluidic chips. A user will use an SVG file to mill out both the control and flow layers of a microfluidic chip. Then he or she will use these 2 layers to sandwich a piece of PDMS and vacuum the chip to create a seal. Through Neptune, the user is encouraged to use this fabrication infrastructure to make their chip so that they may rapidly prototype many chips inexpensively for any iterations of their experiment and easily control their microfluidic system through the Neptune interface.
Microfluidic Application | Ali Lashkaripour
Explorations into the biological applications for Neptune’s workflow are spearheaded by Ali Lashkaripour. He designs and tests features to be added to our UCF repo as relevant primitives to chip designs for synthetic biological application. Design constraints of microfluidic design through Neptune’s toolchain are also investigated by Lashkaripour.

The Team
The iGEM Team Hamburg consists of 16 students from the University of Hamburg. Studying Biology, Nanotechnology, or Molecular Life Sciences,                         there is a great interdisciplinary exchange resulting in a project taking into account all fields of study represented by the students.
Daniel Cortés
Field of Study:
Molecular Life Sciences,
2nd Semester M.Sc.
Role:
Student Leader
About him:
Van Gogh once said: Great things are done by a series of small things brought together. And what goes for a painting, also goes for every great piece of work –                              scientific or otherwise. Every project started as a small idea (probably born in a shower, statistically speaking), every sponsor is acquired by an e-mail,                              every scientific design is carried out by single experiment and this simulation of a multiverse is generated one planck-time at a time. Therefore I, and you,                              and everyone can only try to make this world a better place by small incremental steps and random acts of kindness.
Daniel Wedemeyer
Field of Study:
Molecular Life Sciences,
4th Semester B.Sc.
Role:
Student Leader
About him:
I happen to be interested in everything, tending to dive headfirst into every bit of work I find along the way.                              That's how the leading role acquired me. To me, iGEM is a great opportunity to learn important things about working in science.                             Team organisation, Experimental Design and how to invent and set up an own project are skills you don't pick up by studying - that's why I'm at iGEM.
Steffen Tietjen
Field of Study:
Nanotechnology,
4th Semester M.Sc.
Role:
Student Leader
About him:
Since I started studying Nanoscience my interest and faith in medicine grew. I recognized that science gives us little bricks which can be put together to big solutions in medicine. Research is the foundation of all medical questions, so when I first heard of iGEM I wanted to become a competitor in this big game. iGEM is a strong community of researching students in different fields of science. I love the interdisciplinary exchange with people from other countries all over the world. The cite that describes me the most is from Isaac Newton: What we know is a drop, what we don't know is an ocean.
Cari Lehmann
Field of Study:
Molecular Life Sciences,
6th Semester B.Sc.
Role:
Student Member
About her:
The reason why I decided to take part at iGEM is probably why I do most of the things in my life, because of my curiosity. I am always looking forward to learn new things and to understand the world better one step at a time and iGEM is a perfect opportunity to not only learn and practice my skills in the laboratory. What I mostly enjoy about iGEM is that it also promotes our creativity, organisation skills and is a great platform to meet people, who share the same passion as I do.
Paula Weidemüller
Field of Study:
Molecular Life Sciences,
6th Semester B.Sc.
Role:
Student Member
About her:
I'm at iGEM because I'm always eager to learn and get to know new things. Besides improving and practicing my lab skills, I really enjoyed to explore different techniques and disciplines of the life sciences besides what I already knew from my own field of studies. Furthermore, iGEM is a great opportunity to get a real insight into how working as a scientist will be like and from what I experienced so far it makes me want to pursue this career even more.
Alina Nicolai
Field of Study:
Biology,
2nd Semester B.Sc.
Role:
Student Member
About her:
iGEM is a great experience: you go into the laboratory and build your own construct out of parts like with lego bricks, but it’s more like a shaky house of cards, that you try to build with no glue left. Some part falls apart and you build it back up again, with the hope it sticks this time. But the good thing is that you have a great team around you that supports you. You learn a lot of fascinating things, gather a lot of experience – that’s why I’m at iGEM.
Dominika Wawrzyniak
Field of Study:
Molecular Life Sciences,
4th Semester B.Sc.
Role:
Student Member
About her:
Giving organisms a new purpose for the greater good simply by programming them through clever assembly of biobricks is an aspect which fascinates me about synthetic biology and the curiosity about it initially got me into iGEM. Working on our project, I learned the steps it takes to develop an idea into an real life application and to never shy away from thinking on a big scale even if you have just the least amount of resources. It is a great opportunity, to work together with people equally interested and motivated and getting valuable insights into their disciplines with their individual potentials and possibilities.
Samira Huss
Field of Study:
Molecular Life Sciences,
6th Semester B.Sc.
Role:
Student Member
About her:
When I decided to study Molecular Life Sciences it was mainly because I did not know what I am most interested in: biology, chemistry or medicine. Luckily I realised during my studies that I do not have to choose. To understand the mechanisms of life you need the achievements of every scientific subject anyway and for me the challenge is to discover the connections between the fields. In iGEM we even go one step further: working together with people of different subjects, we establish a biochemical reporter system in microorganisms (biology) which we immobilise on a lab-on-a-chip device (nanotechnology) to tackle a global medical problem - that's why I'm at iGEM.
Kai Pohl
Field of Study:
Molecular Life Sciences,
2nd Semester M.Sc.
Role:
Student Member
About him:
I joined the iGEM team Hamburg to learn. Consequently, I learned about synthetic biology and how it can be an impressive tool to takle real problems. I learned about all the small but crucial aspects of developing our ideas to concepts and solutions. I learned to be passionate and perservering when confronted with setbacks (and to work at night). But most importantly, I learnt what it means to be part of a team of likeminded people who are giving their all to try to change the world for the better.
Dana Winter
Field of Study:
Molecular Life Sciences,
2nd Semester M.Sc.
Role:
Student Member
About her:
My enthusiasm for iGEM is based on the diversity and many faces a project within iGEM offers. I think it is very exciting to have an own research project, which one builds up together with fellow students. It offers us the opportunity to apply our own ideas and gain practical experiences. That is what motivated me to take part in this interdisciplinary competition, far from everyday life at University hoping to gather more knowledge and experiences.
Andreas Schlegel
Field of Study:
Nanotechnology,
2nd Semester M.Sc.
Role:
Student Member
About him:
Getting a glimpse of the big picture is what we aspire. As researchers-to-be iGEM gives us a unique opportunity to experience a peerless view into the excitement of a research project in all its facets. It is an honour and pleasure to design and develop an idea into a palette of challenges which are to be overcome to bring a product of impact to the world. Thanks to every detail that demands thoughtful attention, our project continues to let me grow as a professional every day.
Ekaterina Borissova
Field of Study:
Molecular Life Sciences,
4th Semester B.Sc.
Role:
Student Member
About her:
I joined iGEM because I wanted to experience the development of a project from the very beginning. I wanted to see which difficulties could arise, and how a team of students would deal with them. I am lucky to be part of such a nice team, with them the time in the lab is much more fun! In my free time I enjoy travelling, singing in a choir and fencing.
Alp Mirdoğan
Field of Study:
Molecular Life Sciences,
4th Semester B.Sc.
Role:
Student Member
About him:
From time to time I like to think that we consist of a red fluid that's flowing really fast through our veins, which are embedded in tissues made out of very small molecules, which are programmed in the language of nature, with its tiny alphabet of ATGC, so that we can do math, science, art, music, or run around in the laboratory trying to figure out what went wrong with the last batch of ligation preparations. This is enough for me to get goosebumps, this makes me feel alive. That's why I'm at iGEM.
Leon Schmidt
Field of Study:
Molecular Life Sciences,
8th Semester B.Sc.
Role:
Student Member
About him:
Why am I here? Well actually ..
Since I was able to contribute to last years “Flu Fighters” project due to my work in human genetics I catched up with the idea of iGEM. The whole concept of building up a very own project from scratch completely planned and realized by students really got me so therefore this year I wanted to be all into it! As for me iGEM is a great chance to already get a feeling of how real scientific project working is being done. There’s plenty of time to explore your own strengths and skills but also to cope with the own weaknesses. For me one of the most notable things that I took with me from my time within our iGEM-project is the following quote:
Anything that can go wrong will go wrong

Zoya Ignatova
Zoya Ignatova was our primary Principal Investigator. She is professor for biochemistry at the University of Hamburg and specified in RNA biochemistry,                                         in particular on tRNAs. She not only provided us the laboratories and equipment, but also helped with troubleshooting and through teaching us about translation profiled optimization, which we greatly needed for our experiments. While she advised us on all levels of the project, she also gave us a free hand in developing and executing our ideas. Without Professor Ignatovas great engagement for building up an iGEM team at our university we would never had the chance to realize such an extensive and ambitious project already in the second year of participation.
Frauke Adamla
Frauke was our secondary Principal Investigator. She was always helpful and supported us with her lab experience every time we were confronted with problems and uncertainties. Thanks to her dedicated way to advise us, even members without any laboratory experience were able to adapt quickly.                                         She furthermore supported us with organizing our experiments and our laboratory equipment. After one year of minor and major experimental and personal dramas Frauke is not only our secondary PI, she is a part of our team.
Henning Jacobsen
Henning ist the Advisor of our Team. He was the team leader of the first iGEM Team of the University of Hamburg (Flu Fighters in 2015). He advised us how to plan a project, helped to find our sponsors and provided us with his wide network. All team members profited a lot by his lab knowledge and for our team leaders he was an enormous help in terms of staff management. Day and night he was available for questions and problems. Although he is not a regular team member and did not work in the lab physically: he is our lab hero!

We would like to thank all of our advisors Fatima, Alex, John and Lucas for helping us through the summer by giving us important feedback on how our project was developing and giving us the push and motivation that we sometimes needed. A special thanks for all your help when writing the content for the wiki.
Our wet lab advisors Fatima, Alex and John trained us in the lab giving us the vital skills we needed in order to complete our iGEM project. They advised us from the very beginning, on how to design primers, clone our device, run DNA gels, carry out bacterial transformations, analyse our DNA sequencing data all the way to characterising our biobrick devices by western blotting. Lucas was responsible for helping us to produce detailed mathematical models as well as providing much guidance throughout the whole project.
We would like to thank the Molecular Microbiology department, in particular, Michele Liney and Jackie Heilbronn, for making us feel so welcome over the summer and providing us with the lab, office and computer space.
Thank you to Dr Grant Buchanan and Alex Finney for providing us with Serratia marcescens Db11 gDNA.
Thank you to Dr Grant Buchanan for advice and tips when cloning wasn’t working.
Thank you to the IT department for getting our accounts up and running.
Thank you to the Central Technical services for giving media. They provided a fast and reliable service throughout the entire project and were always friendly and helpful whenever we needed help filling out the order forms.
Thank you to the MRC PPU DNA sequencing and services for giving us some free sequencing runs.
Thank you to Zach Holmes for freelance engineering the ACME Stomach Masher.
Thank you to Kate Harper, Jackie Heilbronn and Jackie Glenn for assisting in the printing for the various merchandise required for the Dundee iGEM team.
A special thank you to Erin Stanbridge for being highly organised and arranging all our travel and visa paperwork for the events that we’ve attended throughout the course of iGEM. We don’t think we’d make it to Boston without you.
Thank you to Dr Jacqui McElhiney and her team at Food Standard Scotland for guiding our project into what it has become today.  We'd also like to thank Katherine Allan at the Veterinary Medicines Directorate in the Department for Food, the Environment and Rural Affairs for guiding our project into a real-world application.
PiCLS Symposium for giving us the platform to practice our iGEM presentation. We really appreciate the opportunity to do so and received valuable feedback with regards to the presentation, allowing us to improve upon it for the Boston jamboree.
We would like to thank IDT for giving us 10,000 free bases for synthesising gBlock Gene fragments. This made our summer so much easier, one less PCR makes all the difference.

Kieron Lucas
I spent this summer working in the wet lab and I received help from all other wet lab members in order to finish experiments and to plan our constructs. When I was attempting to produce the full length colicin control constructs, Rachel and Chris helped me with cloning and to verify the constructs through gel analysis.  I received a lot of help from the advisors Fatima, Alex and John when completing a new procedure or when I had any questions.  I was involved in creating the Bactifeed and received a lot of help from John as he had experience in this area allowing me to carry out these experiments well and receive good data.
Fatima Rehman
Whilst working in the dry lab, I got a lot of help from Lucas for the mathematical modelling. He would give me different tasks to focus on, to help me build my knowledge within MATLAB – we then went on to carry out mathematical modelling. Professor Davidson also assisted and guided me throughout the modelling stages. He pushed us to improve ourselves with our presentation, with his vast knowledge and experience of iGEM. Fatima helped me in the lab when I was carrying out my plate reader experiments, helped edit the presentation and also helped me improve my presenting skills.
Holly Parker
During the summer I was working on the characterisation of the promoter parts which we were using, I received help from Fatima Ulhuq, Alex Finney and John Allan. These people helped me familiarise myself with the protocols and towards the end of the project they all helped with last minute Western blotting. I also worked on designing the Hardware, for which I received a helping hand from a volunteering freelance engineer (Zachary Holmes) who was not part of our team. He used the Dundee's Makers Space to put the hardware together. The hardware was then used for our proof of concept experiments which were carried out by Kieron, Darren and John. Outside of the wet lab I was part of the presentation team and together with Rachel and Fatima Rehman we received a lot of helpful feedback from John, Alex and Fatima Ulhuq as well as our Supervisors, Frank Sargent, Fordyce Davidson and Tracy Palmer. Many thanks to everyone who helped.
Darren Scrimgeour
I worked in the Dry Lab, focusing on Human Practices and how it affects our project. Throughout the summer, we spoke to several government bodies including Food Standards Scotland and the Department for the Environment for Food and Rural Affairs regarding our project and how we could improve.  I also organised a day at the Glasgow Science Centre displaying interactive experiments, with help from Professor Nicola Stanley-Wall and Erin Hardee, and co-organised a debate with the University of Edinburgh Undergraduate iGEM team, and the debating unions of the Universities of Dundee and Edinburgh.
Rachel Elliott
In the wet lab, I had a lot of help from our advisors Fatima Ulhuq, Alex Finney, John Allan. They taught me the basic skills needed to begin the project and helped me to work through lab problems as they arose throughout the summer. Fatima and Alex helped to design the lysis experiment we used to test our modified toxins. The other members of the Wet Lab, Holly, Chris and Kieron were also always there to lend a hand when needed. I was also part of the presentation team with Holly Parker and Fatima Rehman, we received extensive advice from the three aforementioned advisors as well as Lucas Morales and Professors Frank Sargent, Tracy Palmer and Fordyce Davidson, and the rest of team.
Chris Nelis
For the first half of the project I was involved in the web labs work helping to produce the first constructs that were produced. I received help from Kieron in the lab when carrying out the early stages of the cloning. A lot of my time has been spent working on the wiki and I would like to say thanks to everyone for working on the content for the site and thanks to our advisor Fatima for helping with the content and uploads for the wiki. I got help from all of the advisors when starting the lab work to make sure I knew how to properly carry out all lab work to a high standard.
Ummi Jameel
I spent my summer doing the graphic design for the team as well as the merchandise for Boston. I received help from the team in many ways in helping to understand the science behind the project."

Hello, we are the 2016 Dundee Schools team from (you guessed it) Dundee, a small city on the East coast of Scotland. Pictured above is where the magic happened, a.k.a. our project; it is the College of Life Sciences, a building owned by Dundee University (who also so very kindly funded us, hint hint here's our Attributions page, which also tells you a bit more about what we all did to contribute to our project).
Below you will find everything you need to know about who we are. Most of it, anyway.

Throughout our project we have received support and help from a whole variety of people, and we would like to extend our gratitude to everyone involved.
We would like to thank Prof. Frank Sargent, Prof. Tracy Palmer and Prof. Fordyce Davidson, who made this amazing opportunity became a reality by putting our team together and securing both that oh-so-crucial funding and a place in which to work that allowed us to take part in iGEM. They have also aided greatly by guiding us through various aspects of our project, ranging from the biology behind it to maths modelling.
A big thank you to our amazing advisors Fatima Ulhuq, Alex Finney and John Allan, who all helped us tremendously with teaching us how to work in a lab, as well as guiding us through our project. Big thanks also to our other advisor Lucas J. Morales Moya, who taught us maths modelling from scratch and could always find time in which to help us with it.
The same to the Dundee University collegiate team for working alongside us and always being on hand to help out, as well as for being fun to spend breaks with.
We would also like to give a big thank you to:
Erin Stanbridge, Division Secretary - for always helping to organise everything and anything, including train journeys and flights. Oh, and that beautifully stocked stationary cupboard *wipes tear*.
Dr Jackie Heilbronn, Lab Manager - for teaching us all of the lab safety protocols and making sure we stayed safe.
Dr Grant Buchanan for teaching us a lot about microbiology, providing help, giving us samples of Serratia marcescens and E. coli gDna, and for making us laugh with his jokes.
We would also like to thank the Sarah Coulthurst lab for providing us with Serratia Db10 gDNA.
IT Department of Dundee University for providing us with access to the Uni network, which allowed us to do a lot of work (and access to free wifi, for super important researching and Pokémon hunting reasons).
Central Technical Services of Dundee University for providing us with clean and sterilised equipment, as well as various media used in our project.
MRC PPU DNA Sequencing and Services, for giving us free sequence runs.
The Garland Café in the Life Sciences building, for making dem gewd bacon rolls and for keeping Darryl alive on Monday mornings with coffee.
Olawale Raimi for providing us with Rhamnose in a crucial moment where we ran out.
Brian Walshe from the charity Mercy Ships, for not ignoring us and for referring us to Rob Porter.
Rob Porter, Consultant of Microbiology and Infection - for giving us a lot of detailed feedback on our initial ideas/plans, as well as raising excellent questions that helped shape our project.

Albert Brown
Throughout my summer, I mostly worked in the lab. With the guidance of the advisors Fatima, John and Alex, I was able to learn a lot about working there, and have been able to carry things out independently when required (such as cloning or further producing our final constructs). The Dundee collegiate wet team members aided greatly in learning the initial ways of how I should go about doing my work; I was also particularly helped by John when performing experiments with the constructs to see if our osmY-hfq fusion was being secreted.
Bartosz Witkowski
Throughout our 8 weeks of iGEM, I worked mainly in the labs to do cloning and experiments. With the help of our lab advisors, John, Fatima and Alex, I was involved in the cloning of our BioBricks and further characterisation by doing experiments such as western blots. I also helped with successfully cloning the spiRNA and working on the motility assays. During the early stages of our lab work I was also helped a lot by the Dundee collegiate team as they showed me how to carry out basic procedures and the art of using a pipette. When I wasn’t in the lab I was working on the wiki content, the presentation or learning some of the concepts behind maths modelling.
Matthew Simmons
I worked mostly in the lab; with the help of the lab advisors, I put most of my time into producing our secretion system, which secreted the fusion construct cloned with help from Bartosz, Albert and Mia. Thanks to them, I was able to learn a lot on how to do the various procedures required to produce our construct. In the beginning of the summer the Dundee collegiate team greatly helped me develop the skills needed, and from their experience I have learned not to repeat their mistakes - such as not labelling test tubes.
Individual Attributions: Dry Team
Mia Wood
So that we could get everything done, my time was split 50/50 between the dry and wet teams (wiki coder note: we include her as an honorary dry team member anyway for a satisfyingly even split. Also since it's the better team). In the lab I did a lot of work in making the initial construct and performing the tests on it with the help of John, Fatima and Alex. Working together with the rest of my team in the lab made it very enjoyable, and allowed us to help each other and share our knowledge. When I wasn’t in the lab I would be working with Beth and Darryl on human practices/outreach, contacting various specialists to get their insight into our project. I also worked on the maths modelling with Beth, Bartosz, and Darryl, with the help of Lucas and Prof. Fordyce Davidson. Special shout-out to Fatima for driving me home in time for the Great British Bake Off after being in the lab until late.
Beth Rear
Throughout our project I was mostly part of the dry team, involving myself in maths modelling with help from Lucas and Prof. Fordyce Davidson. I was also focused on the human practices aspect of our project, working together with Mia and Darryl to develop this. Once that was done, I started working on our presentation and poster together with the rest of the team. (She may be a technophobe, but most of the lovely diagrams you see throughout our wiki and on presentation slides were by her and her unexpected Powerpoint prowess). However, I would occasionally be found in the lab helping out with any work to be done, particularly towards the final stages of the project.
Darryl Sime
During our project, I took on the job of coding/bringing together the team’s wiki. With limited prior knowledge of HTML and CSS, I decided to teach myself them using Codecademy, W3Schools, and the wonders of Google. When I hit a snag, I'd also seek guidance when needed from John, or Chris Nelis from the Dundee collegiate team. I also worked on human practices with Mia and Beth, plus a bit of maths modelling with them and Bartosz, guided by Lucas and Dyce. Big big thank you also to Ummi Jameel from the Dundee team, who provided some of the graphics you see on our wiki (team and F.B.I. logos, orange bacteria mascots), and was always there to advise with making
. Also for attempting to get good team photos of us (it didn't really work out).
Lastly we, the 2016 Dundee Schools Team, would like to give a big thank you to everyone in the Life Sciences' Molecular Microbiology Department, who were always very kind and helpful in all situations."

Our Members
Claire RAYNAUD
My staff nicknames are Clairounette or the lab machine depending of the day mood. Perhaps their inspiration came from a remnant of my youth in the Medoc countryside (may it reminds you some wines and red noses...) what has shaped me tough and an occasionally cheeky girl. If I am not on the lab, you can find me in the Calanques enjoying the roof of Marseille or travelling somewhere around the world. Though nature is my big hang-up, heaps of bacterial issues have pushed me to make a Microbiology master degree... However, my best friend is definitely my badminton racquet. I walk it everywhere around Marseille thus I don't forget that I am going to empty my iGEM pressure soon!
Louis GIVELET
Hi! I’m Louis, nicknamed Loulou among the team. I’m fond of molecular biology, biochemistry, microbiology, cellular biology, genetics…uh…well all biology stuff in fact.  I was always convinced that the living is the best source of inspiration we could ever find to solve our current issues. So when I heard about the iGEM competition during my first year of master’s degree I just couldn’t wait to go for it! Among team I’m described as the severe one even if during summer I overwhelmed all my teammates with my specialty, silly jokes…
Yoann SANTIN
Despite the fact I am from Corsica, I do not sleep a lot… Why? Because I am too busy to sharpen my knives in order to eat saucisson ! I recently started my second year of Master degree in Microbiology at Aix-Marseille Université and I hope to begin my PhD at the end of the year. My interest in synthetic biology arises from  its vast range of applications to solve real world problems and it was an amazing opportunity to be involved in iGEM within the Aix-Marseille team as I worked with people from different backgrounds. Outside the laboratory, I maintain my military past (you now understand my haircut…) making hiking and bushcraft with my best friends. Even I am sure it is wrong… people in the lab say I speak a lot, so hang on!
Tangui MESSINA
Hi there! I am Tangui. I was in my 1st year of master degree in Plant biology, Microbiology and Biotechnology at the beginning of this adventure. After a long hesitation last year, I decided to throw myself into the competition. All experiences acquired during this intership in the lab to defend our own project were one of the best experiences in my student life. It allows me to improve my skills and gave birth to a great friendship with the laboratory team. So I just have to say: Do not hesitate and just do it.
CEM KARAKUS
Hi I'm Cem, I'm currently perform a biology bachelor that is called ""physiology and neurosiences"". I've been an EEDF member for 6 years now (a french secular scouting movement). I'm 1m93 tall when I stand and the same when I lay I believe. Why am I participating to IGEM 2016? Because I'm fond of science. My participation as a AMU member hasn't been huge actually, I was mostly taking care of the human practices and of video footage, I would have loved participate to the lab manipulation too.
Marie-Alice MINASSIAN
Hey, I’m Marie-Alice Minassian a second year cell biology student at Aix-Marseille University. As I am the youngest in the team, I'm afraid I'll remain a 17 year old first year student to my friends for the rest of my life...
When I'm not in class annoying my professors I also enjoy annoying my friends, watching anime, heavy metal music and fighting for student rights as a member of UNEF (National Union of Students of France).
This year I decided to participate in iGEM to expand my knowledge of the scientific world. During our project my main responsibilities were at the lab and engaging with the public at large in the scope of our Human Practices program, writing sponsoring documents and texts for the wiki.
Overall iGEM was one of the most enriching experiences of my life and I am thankful that I had the chance to be a part of this amazing project.
Ndour Mame Gor
Hello, I'm NDOUR Mame Gor,I come from Spain (origin Senegalese-Algerian). I was a second year biochemistry student at Aix-Marseille-University. I made a gateway to continue in medicine in STRASBOURG. Why? Because I want to be a doctor specialized in oncology. I can't go to the end of our project (Highway to Platinium) because I have to revise the first year medical course in more than the second year.
François Morlet
Hello! I'm François, I'm a first year master's student in Computer Science (digital imaging) in Luminy in Marseille. Even if it is not my field of study, I love biology ... so it was a great joy to can participate in the Aix-Marseille team, and discover what we could do with synthetic biology! I helped for the wiki, collaborations, and human practices.  I also enjoy living in Marseille, both the city and its beautiful surroundings :)
Our Advisors
Nin Sebastien
Hi, I'm Sébastien. I'm currently in first year of master of bioinformatics, structural biochemistry and genomic. I did iGEM last year and it was a very rewarding experience. This year, I had sadly not enough time to participate in the lab, but I helped with the wiki design and the collaborations.
Marion Aruanno and Yoann Chabert
Hi ! We are Marion and Yoann, the advisor's couple. We were in the team last year and we really enjoyed this first experience! So this year we recruit the new team and we tried to help them by giving them some advices or take care of things like sponsors or other  small problems.
Valérie Prima
Hi, my name is Valérie Prima, I've been working as an engineer in James Sturgis Laboratory « Laboratoire des Systèmes macromoléculaires » in Marseille (France) since 16 years. I'm studying the photosystem of purple bacteria, using molecular biology, biochemistry and biophysic technics. I'm very proud to participate to the IGEM contest as an instructor. First because I love teaching my knowledge and second because I think it's a unique human adventure. This year the team of Marseille was very motivated, they worked very hard during all the summer to achieve the experiments. I think they gave the best and I hope they will win the gold medal.
Our Supervisors
Sandra Michel
Hi everyone ! I'm in the last year of my thesis in Microbiology in Aix-Marseille University. I participated at iGEM with the first team of AMU and I loved the experience. I like the concept of synthetic biology, the standardisation, the outstanding quality and diversity of the projects, the human experience, that's why I wanted to start again this year with the new project on the platinum !
Laureen Logger
Hi all! I'm Laureen and I'm starting the fourth year of my PhD on the type VI secretion system. It is the second time I am a supervisor of the Igem Aix-Marseille team and still an exciting adventure! I can't wait to see the other projects and discuss with you guys! See you!
Gaël Chambonnier
Hi everyone, I'm a PhD Candidate in Marseille at the LISM. When I first took part in the iGEM competition 6 years ago as a student, I didn't know that it would hooked me up that much. But it's always a great pleasure to be part of this incredible adventure where you meet great people and find great science. Now that I'm finishing my PhD, I'm looking for a postdoc position where I will continue to deal with Synbio and hopefully with iGEM!! Relax and have FUN!! #SynBio #iGEM
James Sturgis
Hi everyone, I am a Professor of Biochemistry and laboratory director in Marseille. I recently created a synthetic biology course at the university and so was very keen to help our team turn theory into practice by participating in the iGEM, and to find out how synthetic biology can change the way we use biology. When I am not teaching student or doing research, I enjoy hiking and music.
Romain Clement
Hi, my name is Romain Clément, I’m third year PhD student in Marseille (France) and I work on micro-algae. I participate to the iGEM competition to discover the biosynthetic biology world. I give my help in my competence domains to this student team that have an interesting subject on platinum recycling.
Christophe Bordi
Hi, I'm an Associate Professor of Genomics and Molecular Microbiology in Marseille. I was delighted to join the team this year. I was very happy to discover Synbio and to share my bench experience. It was great to see how students can be motivated by science.

Team
Our team has 17 members in total, 12 of them junior, and other 5 are sophomores.                         Having 9 female team members, our team is really gender-balanced.                         Members also come from many varies majors including Chemistry, Biology, Computer Science and Materials Science and Engineering.                         Now, let’s meet the excellent team members.
Student
Hey, guys! I am Mu Zepeng.                                     As a biology major, I was instantly hooked to synthetic biology when I first heard about such concepts as genetic circuits.                                     In the past year, I have been one of the student leaders of our team.                                     I am also in charge of the screening of toxin-antitoxin pairs of for our kill-switch.                                     I am also interested in Computer Programing.
I AM Zhuoning Zou, a junior majoring in Biology Science. I have been fascinated by natural and artificial design of life since learning synthetic biology. I dreamt about unlocking more mysteries of life at molecular level, like decoding genetic information or exploring the rule of genetic regulation. In our project, I am in charge of finding the most effective antibiotic degrading enzymes. Besides academics, I am a music lover who enjoy singing and playing the clarinet, also active in Students' Union and Model UN.
I am a current junior seeking to understand life as chemistry.                                     Experiences at labs focused on waste water treatment, nano materials, electrochemistry and synthetic biology give me a special vision and broad interest.                                     I am also a campus journalist, having interviewed university president, academicians as well as ordinary students with unique stories.                                     I take the part of modeling and hardware designing and some lab work in our team, as a social role who push the teammates together and forward and prepare the laboratory consumables.
My major is biology, which, I think, has the closest relationship to the human being among all subjects.                                     Biologists aim to learn as much as possible about the secrets of life, and apply the knowledge to cure diseases, control pollution, develop new energy, etc.                                     Among all the sub-disciplines of biology, I find molecular biology to be the most attractive one.                                     It is the reactions between different biological molecular in cells that determine what we are.                                     With the development of molecular biology, now we can partly regulate those reactions to achieve certain purposes using synthetic biology.                                     The iGEM is a pioneer of this field.                                     I hope I can create my own genetically engineered machines and have a good time here.
My name is HUANG Jianyi and I’m a sophomore at UCAS.                                     As a biology major, I’m curious about the structure of various proteins and the corresponding properties.                                     I’m obsessed with the precision and efficiency with which thousands of reactions perform in a cell.                                     The secrets of life appeal great to me, life in labs also seems attractive and interesting and I’m hoping to one day discover what I’m curious about.                                     Out of biology, I’m a helpless sports fanatic and a music lover.
Hi there.                                     I am Ruiling Cai , a biology major student in my second year at University of Chinese Academy of Sciences.                                     iGEM is interesting to me since there is much room for creativity and diversity.                                     Synthetic biology is a highly interdisciplinary field that allows individuals from a multitude of backgrounds to come together and produce novel systems, or reinvent preexisting ones, trying to make more or less contributions to the world.
I am Walter, modeler and programmer in our team.                                     Majoring in chemistry, I am interested in interdisciplinary studies, therefore I participate in projects of many fields, including optics, applied mathematics, machine learning beside iGEM.                                     I was fascinated by the concept of synthetic biology and genetic circuit, it is like doing something as God does.
I am a sophomore at UCAS, majoring in Biology.                                     I have gotten into synthetic biology since a period of lab life in a molecular biology lab whose research projects are related to virus.                                     I hope to make the best of synthetic biology to create something crazy but can make a difference to people’s life, and I think iGEM seems like a perfect beginning.                                     In my free time, I like to make acquaintance with peers.                                     I am the president of the Undergraduate Student Union of UCAS.                                     Besides, I really enjoy breaking--- a kind of street dancing.
I am Xu Yue, junior student at UCAS.                                     I am majoring at Materials Science and Engineering and I am the only engineering student at team.                                     I love to read the blueprint and realize it.                                     What IGEM attracts me most is to collaborate with peer students.                                     No matter how crazy your idea might be, we can sit around the table, think it over and discuss thoroughly.                                     Aside from lab work, I try to cook.                                     After all, reading a recipe is not much different from reading an experiment protocol.

I am Liu Ye and I am a junior student in the school of life science.                                     I focused on the experiment to select the best degrading enzyme.                                     I also gained more confidence of myself while doing human practice.                                     It's wonderful to work with group of students sharing the same interests.                                     Thanks for all the team members working together.                                     In my spare time, I like reading literature and writing poems or novels.
My name is Yushan Liu, I am a sophomore in UCAS, who is responsible for helping with the selection of TA system.                                     iGEM has provided me with work portion and taught me to keep an open mind to different aspects of science and medicine, besides, it creates opportunities for me to meet other teams’ members, so I can learn to see issues from many new perspectives.                                     I am very interested in health care fields in biology filed, I hope to major in biology in the future and learn further on this aspect .                                     In my free time, I love playing piano and watching TV plays.
I’m Yueren Jiang, a sophomore major in Chemistry in UCAS.                                     I was drawn to iGEM because of the opportunity for allowing young students to work on synthetic biology experiments.                                     In some way, I’m bored with empty theories without experimental evidence, so I hope I can learn some real skills to broaden my vision and knowledge and make more friends.                                     This summer, I fully immersed myself in the TA module experiments, one of the most important parts of our project.                                     Through the process, I have learned a lot.                                     Instead of feeling content, I’m worried, because I know time is really limited and there are still some highlights need to be added to our project.                                     Anyway, I hope we get good achievements in this game.
My name is Li Yongming.                                     I am a junior student major in Chemistry in UCAS.                                     I am interested in Biology and have learned some biological courses.                                     Doing experiments and research is a good opportunity to make me have a better understanding of synthetic biology.                                     In the summer, I have been in charge of some experiments of selecting several potential enzymes which can degrade antibiotic.                                     I also did some human practice to make the public know more about antibiotic and its possible harm of misuse and overuse.                                     I have learned much since we began our project.                                     It is a great and unforgettable experience to work with my teammates.
Loving life science, loving challenge, and don’t love restrictions and fetters.                                     Loving football, loving traveling, and don’t love immutable and frozen.                                     Loving reading, loving movie, and loving the wonderful life.                                     I am Dang Yiqun, and I represent myself.

Project Timeline
The team met for the first time at the beginning of April. For the next month-and-a-half, we brainstormed ideas for our project. By our first day in lab at the end of May, we knew we wanted to design a thallium sensor. Our circuit design solidified over the next week or so as we started to familiarize ourselves with the lab space. By the next week, we were learning lab techniques and applying them to our project.
As we became more comfortable in the lab, we started thinking about human practices. We reached out to summer programs and science museums in the area to see if we could share our iGEM experience with their kids. From July through August, we were busy teaching others about synthetic biology as we continued to develop our idea in the lab.
Work on the Wiki started early in the summer, mainly developing the overall design and adding as much information as we had. Modeling started near the end of the summer as our project became finalized and we had better ideas for what to model.
See our lab notebook for more details on what we worked on each week. It's been a great summer, and we can't wait to meet everyone at the Jamboree!"

Who are we?
This year’s iGEM team consists of 14 students from many different scientific fields including biology, chemistry, medicine, biochemistry/biophysics and computer science. Our team is supervised by Jun. Prof. Maximilian Ulbrich and Dr. Nicole Gensch, both being part of the scientific staff of the BIOSS Centre for Biological Signalling Studies. We also get advice and support from Luisa Keilholz and Adrian Fischer, former iGEM participants who are sharing their experiences and knowledge with us.
Niklas Vesper - Brain of the team and the one you will find in lab at every time of the day (or rather “night”) doing his job as head of cloning group. Also he is responsible for modeling, internal wiki and registry pages. Most impressive thing about this guy is the sparkles in his eyes when telling someone about all the crazy and cool stuff he is learning and when his brain gets filled with new facts and pictures of glowing gels. When it gets late at night you can clearly see the mischief in his eyes and know he is up to something! Always tries to lighten the mood with his (most of the time pretty dumb and silly) jokes:D
Nathalie Wagner - One of the hardest working team members we got! You could consider her the head of the dry lab since she is responsible for all the organisational stuff, human practice and most importantly our finances. Without her, the team would probably have been all over the place. Her part as a team leader is not always the easiest since she had to remind us to do certain things at least once a day. She also makes sure we don’t miss any deadlines and lives out her creativity with the styling of our poster, presentation, external wiki and all the graphics.
Katharina Ostmann - But first, coffee! Katha is one of our most precious team members. She may not always be the most approachable person in the morning without coffee, but if you have a lot of stuff on your mind or to do in the lab, she is always the first to offer you her help.   Even though she herself is a group leader for protein purification and the 3rd chairman of our nonprofit association. Her other tasks mainly include checking the requirements for medals and prizes and the sponsoring, but honestly, she helps out wherever she can and is needed.
Danja Steinberg - Our mother of dragons .. ehm .. I mean .. producer of Spores! Danja is doing all the work the other teams rely on as the head of the bacillus basic group. It is hard work, we know, but she makes it all happen and we could not think about iGEM without her! Besides being awesome in the lab for most of the day, she always has an open ear to all your problems.   Apart from being responsible for sponsoring and taking care that we don’t miss to fullfil all iGEM requirements, she helps writing the texts for this Wiki.
Wladislaw Stroukov - Our sub-galactic hyper emperor. Wlad is our trump card when it comes to labwork. He has a lot of experience and is keen to share it with you if you are interested. Do you have a problem or a question about a method or the project in general? Just go and ask him, I assure you he will give you more than enough information. Wlad is also head of the wet lab and one of the most dedicated team members, who you will always find in the lab at night.
Mario Ramos Garcia - Fountain of caffeine and energy!! You will always find Mario sitting in the corner of our seminar room, tapping away on his computer (most likely doing some exhausting stuff like the statistics ) and in front of him either coffee or a big can of monster energy… and that at all times! As the head of the group 5 he is practically glued to our amazing plate reader from BMG labtech and you can watch him pipetting like a thousand dilutions. Always with a nice scent of shampoo surrounding him, since he is also responsible for our fun application the dandruff shampoo.
Vivien Jesenofsky - Our happy person. Always being around to cheer you up if you had a bad day. She is also part of our adhesion group where she is helping Kevin and Chris wherever she can. Together with Tina, Vivi is mainly responsible for our collaboration with other teams, so you might have already gotten in contact with her via skype or mail. Vivi is well know in the team for leaving little funny and weird notes all over the lab, which makes everyone happy.
Christina Imkea Saw Zoina Soon - But don’t call her that. We don’t know why but she prefers to be simply called Tina. Together with Mario, she is responsible for the activation assay - the second part of our proof of concept and our other good smelling application, the shampoo. As part of the collaboration team Tina helps us to get in touch with other teams and plans tons of stuff we could do together.
Syed Mohsin Ali - You always need a computer guy on your side… at least if you don’t want to lose your head while staring at endless computer codes. Together with Nathalie he is responsible for our external Wiki and introduced our minds to the magical and very confusing world of HTML.
Kevin Kieselmann - Still waters run deep. He sure isn’t a man of many words, but he is head of adhesion group where he and Chris work on the adhesion of our little dragons .. ehm .. spores. Most of his time he spends looking through the microscope, making sure the spores do what he wants them to do. Apart from this, he is helping with the sponsoring and our facebook page.
Christian Massute - Our granddad and model. Chris is our representative when it comes to the public affairs of our project.
Apart from his appearance he is also doing a great job in our laboratory work. Together with Kevin and Vivi he is responsible for the Adhesion part of our Project.   Beside being the head of sponsoring, he does the traveling organisation, so that no other member has to loose their mind worrying about it.
Lucy Wong - Our medical treasure chest. Do you have questions about anything medicine-related while working? Just write our medicine student Lucy and get the answer straight away! This is the benefit of working in an interdisciplinary team like this. Getting her priorities straight, she always gets her stuff done in a very little amount of time.
Yannic Schäfer - Source of creativity and funny lab photos! Yannic’s main tasks are human practice, sponsoring and documentation of our summer. So all of the pictures you find in this wiki are “made by Yannic”. He is always interested in different parts of our project and goes to each lab group from time to time to ask questions and learns exciting things. In his free time, which right now - let’s be honest here - is none, he usually is all about movies and is always ready to give you his opinion on them.
Zaid Ur rehman - Our cooking-tec guy. Zaid is always there to help out with technological questions concerning the external wiki or even with smaller problems like fixing the internet on your laptop. Together with Mohsin and Nathalie, he takes on the enormous task of designing the external wiki and makes sure our project is well presented online and for the judges."

A project like this is not feasible without the kind support of a lot of different people and companies. This page is only for all of those who helped us with all kinds of advice, material and financial support, and of course also mental support in the phase of teambuilding. ;) The first members started meeting at the end of march, kindly supported by Jun. Prof. Maximilian Ulbrich and Dr. Nicole Gensch who have been working with the last two iGEM-team as well. As the project had settled and the first experiments were done we were really glad to welcome Prof. Wolfgang Schamel in the instructor team.
Wolfgang
Immunologist and Protein Biochemist - Professor at BIOSS
Max
Doctoral degree in Biophysics - Research Group Leader at BIOSS
Nicole
Doctoral degree in biology - Head of Toolbox at BIOSS
The process of finding a suitable project can be really time consuming and frustrating since every project has their limiting aspect and the overall bounding time factor. After countless discarded ideas we started discussing the work of previous iGEM teams.
“Beadzillus” by LMU Munich from 2012 caught our attention and interest. To get some inside into working with Bacillus subtilis, we were in contact with Julia Bartels from Munich who was part of said team from 2012. She has contributed a lot of material and gave us valuable advice to get started. She has helped us immensely which we are very grateful for.
Once we had agreed on a project we could finally start working in our lab at BIOSS. The BIOSS institute is the reason we were able to take part at this year’s iGEM competition. Without its generous funding and access to its conference rooms, labs and hardware, we couldn’t have done it. A big thank you to the BIOSS.
To cope with the work we separated the team in 5 “special forces” groups. Cloning - Spore production - Protein cleaning - Adhesion - Enzyme activity. You can see more about this on the Team page.
On all parts of lab and experiments we get help from Adrian and Luisa. Not sure how to plan your controls? Ask Adrian and Luisa! They both participated in iGEM before and help us with protocols from their teams and general lab challanges.
Adrian
Beside working on his doctor thesis, Adrian was always there to support us. He gave important input on the experimental design and helped keeping the team spirit up.
Luisa
Luisa was a member of Team Freiburg 2015. She always provided us with iGEM specific tips and told us about important things we need to keep an eye on. Besides helping out with first steps in the lab, she also supported us out to get through finances forms.
Our project consumed a lot of material - to make sure we never stand there empty-handed we had the support from following sponsors:

Biocompass 2.0
Abstract of bio-compass
The aim of our project is to build a brand new bio-navigational system that can be used by the ordinary people. The map information will be coded in DNA strand and do corresponding biochemical operations. The bio-navigational database will establish the relationship between biochemical operation instructions and traditional navigation instructions. In order to reduce workload in advance， BIO-COMPASS can also screen reaction conditions according to the road conditions. Furthermore, we try to update the system to adapt to the more complex path plans. For this, we design some special enzyme sites which differ from standard bio-bricks’ as the function interfaces. For example, “Logic Gate” genetic device can be inserted in our system to help us solve the path plan which include a transfer station between the start and the destination. BIO-COMPASS will find the best solution by using a variety of detection methods such as electrophoresis and reporter gene.

The “FLAVOFF"" team
Danciger Darca Comprehensive High School is situated in the northernmost city in Israel -  Kiryat Shmona. The city is at a crossroad between Lebanon and Syria, the city has been bombed  numerous times over the years from Lebanon due to the tense situation in the region.
Kiryat Shmona has one central comprehensive high school with 1400  students from seventh through twelfth grade. Darca Danciger is a public  school.
The school is a public school housing 1400 students. There are a variety of students starting  with students of excellence who are aimed at dealing with engineering fields in the future,  medicine and trade in Israel. The school has 8 classes for students with special needs including  regular students and youth at risk. The school students are Israeli citizens, former Lebanese  citizens and residents from the Golan Heights (former Syrian citizens). The school practices and  educates tolerance and love towards the other.
With a goal to pass on the knowledge in Synthetic Biology all around the country to the  different religions, the city’s residents, the Kibbutz and village, to senior students and young  children as well as the blind and elderly, all of these audiences met our Biotechnology major  students in order to get introduced to another field of knowledge – Synthetic Biology.
Since Israel is an immigrants' country, we tried to determine if origin changes the phenotype  and genotype of the sense of taste.
You are invited to dive into the MAGIC of TASTE…

Thanks to:
Distribution of the work was done democratically within the team; each of us chose the field that  interests him more:
The laboratory team work under the guidance of Professor Berkovich who served as the scientific  advisor of the group. We implemented this in practice the experiment and of course planned the next  step into the night. Professor Berkovich helped us to examine the results and move on to the next stage  of the experiment. Completion of the scientific knowledge was done with our staff of teachers; we  studied the methods together from the Internet. The data processing was done by the team, primarily  by the members who are strong in mathematics.
The Community Working Group worked completely independently. The teachers assisted us technically  to make the events that occurred at school come real, all the initiatives were ours, the students. This  group was also used for documenting the entire process, Writing surveys and their implementation.
Our English teacher Dave helped us with the rhetoric of the presentation in a professional manner, with  emphasis on fluent English.
The site was the most complex, but for that there are friends who helped. 2 members of the group  (computer geeks) built the site together; whenever they had a problem our math teacher gave them a  solution – Ofir and classmates who are also addicted to computers.
After a long and extremely busy summer we would like to say:

Istanbul Technical University – Department of Molecular Biology and Genetics
Dr. Bülent Balta: Assistant professor at Istanbul Technical University-Department of Molecular Biology and
Genetics, assisted us in primary investigations on methamphetamine sensor domain and introduced us the field of Molecular Dynamics
Dr. Fatma Neşe Kök: Associate professor at Istanbul Technical University-Department of Molecular Biology and Genetics, assisted as the primary PI of this project, helped us to overcome all the bureaucracy work. Without her trust to us, this project would never have an end.
Dr. Nevin Gül Karagüler: Associate professor at Istanbul Technical University-Department of Molecular Biology and Genetics, Vice-dean of Istanbul Technical University-Faculty of Science and Literature, assisted us as the secondary PI of the project.
Dr. Sefer Baday: Assistant professor at Istanbul Technical University-Institute of Informatics, assisted us for the design and operation of MD simulations, shared necessary codes with us that are necessary for an easy MD simulation.
Dr. Alper Tunga Akarsubaşı: Associate professor, assisted us by sharing his lab equipments including the agarose gel casting system that we used in all of our cloning experiments.
Sponsorship/Financial Support
We would like to thank Governor of Istanbul, VasipŞahin, and Dr. Burhan Metin for their moral and financial support that they provided us. These two person gave us hope about our future and promoted our willing to serve our country with science.
We also would like to thank Prof. Dr. ErtuğrulKaraçuha for his assistance on providing us simulation time sponsorship from the UHeM Supercomputer at Istanbul Technical University, and we are grateful to Dr. KadirDiri for introducing supercomputers to us.
Literature:
In this project, sensor parts for our biosensor derived from 2 main work;
Firstly, binding of methamphetamine to the alpha synuclein protein reported by the Dr. Omid Tavassoly and Dr. Jeremy S. Lee in their study titled as “Methamphetamine binds to alpha synuclein and causes conformational change”. Secondly, anti-METH antibody that we use as the base of our second plan of the project developed by Peterson et al. and reports about design and affinity improvement of that single chain antibody reported in different journals. We use the idea that single chain antibodies can be used for FRET (Fluorescence resonance energy transfer) studies and tried to apply this method for the methamphetamine detection. We are grateful for the contributors of these two projects for providing such a chance for the synthetic biology developers by their research.
Artists/Designers:
Our lovely Meth Busters cartoon drawn by a talented artist from Calluna Design Studio, also a molecular biologist,FundaBüyükbaş, and our team logo designed and drawn by SerdarErbay. We are very grateful for these two artists for their work and the design that they add to our project.
Last but not least, we are very thankful to the web designer and our “çavo” Musa KorayAkpınar for his work to build our website.

Each team must clearly attribute work done by the student team members on this page. The team must distinguish work done by the students from work done by others, including the host labs, advisors, instructors, and individuals not on the team roster.
Why is this page needed?
The Attribution requirement helps the judges know what you did yourselves and what you had help with. We don't mind if you get help with difficult or complex techniques, but you must report what work your team did and what work was done by others.
For example, you might choose to work with an animal model during your project. Working with animals requires getting a license and applying far in advance to conduct certain experiments in many countries. This is difficult to achieve during the course of a summer, but much easier if you can work with a postdoc or PI who has the right licenses.
What should this page have?
General Support
Project support and advice
Fundraising help and advice
Lab support
Difficult technique support
Project advisor support
Wiki support
Presentation coaching
Human Practices support
Thanks and acknowledgements for all other people involved in helping make a successful iGEM team
Can we base our project on a previous one?
Yes! You can have a project based on a previous team, or based on someone else's idea, as long as you state this fact very clearly and give credit for the original project.

Students
Dinula De Silva
I am a grade 12 student at Winston Churchill High School. I enjoy programming, playing the guitar, and watching movies. When I’m not stuck indoors, I like going running and biking. I joined iGEM because the feats of synthetic biology fascinated me and I wanted to learn more about the processes involved. I additionally wanted to develop my computer programming skills by working on the wiki and software aspect of the competition.
Nimaya De Silva
Hello! My name is Nimaya De Silva, and I go to Winston Churchill High School. I am 16 years old and this is my first year of iGEM. I joined iGEM to gain more experience in the lab, and to venture more into the world of biology. But I have also found myself working on human practices as well and have been thoroughly enjoying it!  Besides iGEM, I love to read anything and everything to do with dystopia and Harry Potter! I also take piano lessons, and love to recreate pop songs on the piano!
Anileen Pageni
Hey everyone! My name is Anileen and I am going to be graduating this year from Winston Churchill High School. I will be joining the Physiology program in the University of Alberta this fall! I enjoy every aspect of iGem, but especially love getting involved in the lab and human practices. I joined iGem to further my interest in science and be around like-minded people, which is why this is my second year in iGem. Other than iGem, I enjoy making people laugh, traveling, watching movies and trying out new recipes!
Marissa King
Hello, my name is Marissa King. I am 17 years old and am a grade 12 student at Winston Churchill High School. In the fall I will begin university here in Lethbridge where I will be studying biological sciences. This is my second year being involved in iGEM and i love every aspect of it but my favourite part would have to be working in the lab. I initially joined iGEM to because of my interest in synthetic biology and to gain more experience. Other than iGEM i enjoy travelling, reading, taking photos and spending time with my friends and family.
Ross Oliver
Hello I'm Ross and I am a grade 11 student at Winston Churchill High School. I was interested in re-joining iGEM because of the opportunities and knowledge that it has provide me. Prior to joining iGEM I had no lab experience, and had very limited knowledge about synthetic biology. In my free time I enjoy learning new things,cooking and traveling.
Ronja Kothe
Hello! My name is Ronja. I am 18 years old and in my final year at Winston Churchill High School. In the  fall I will be attending the University of Alberta in the Immunology & Infection program. This is my third  year in iGEM and I have really enjoyed my experience both in the lab and outside of it. In addition to  iGEM, I enjoy playing the clarinet and I’m also a proud Girl Guide. One of my favourite foods are granola  bars, partly because they’re great for camping, which, as a Girl Guide, I also love to do.
Mason Mierzewski
Hi, my name is Mason Mierzewski, and I am a 16 year old student that will be going into grade twelve at Catholic Central High School ensuing the summer. This is my first year participating in iGem, and I have found it to be a very enlightening experience. In my free time, I enjoy playing sports casually or competitively as well as just hanging out with my friends. I am also a fervent fan of music, as I listen to it daily and use it to help me with many tasks. So far, my iGem experience has been congenial and I am very excited to see our project come to its completion.
Advisors
Chris Issac
Hi there. I’m Chris. This year the title of codemeister has been thrust upon me and I hope that by the time the website is done, you’ll be able to be here reading this. For now, I’m working on finishing up my B.Sc. and splitting my time between work, iGEM, and pursing a career as a purveyor of terrible jokes.
Sydnee
Hello, I’m Sydnee! Once upon a time I thought I was going to be a psychologist, but then I decided science was a lot more fun. This is my second year being involved with iGEM and I am enjoying my time working on human practices.
Kieran
Hello, my name is Kieran McCormack. I am currently finished my second year of Biochemistry at the University of Lethbridge, which allows for a nice contrast between the normal science world and the more defined synthetic biology world. I enjoy doing new activities and have found great joy from being an adviser on the team; whether that be through new friendships, communications or spread of knowledge. I have enjoyed learning about myself throughout this year, and hopefully I can continue to do so into the future.
Brian
I am a Structural Biochemist and new to Synthetic Biology and iGEM. I love the idea of being able to make whatever I want in the lab. Previously I have used NMR and X-ray crystallography to look at protein-protein interactions. My wife is a Biochemist also, which makes dinner conversation interesting (for us anyways).
HJ
Originally from Germany I moved to Canada in 2005 to start a research group on the structure and function of the bacterial protein synthesis machinery, a cellular process targeted by over 50% of the known antibiotics. I am intrigued by the molecular design and function of this essential bio-nanomachine. I try to unravel the underlying design principles in order to enable the rational design and engineering of novel bio-nanomachines. I am essentially asking the question if such novel bio-machines can be constructed from simple and fundamental principles or are these assemblies just to complex. Well and that’s why it was extremely easy to rope me into doing iGEM.

I love science, so naturally iGem is a program I seem to keep returning to. My role has been mostly that of a writer and a researcher. I am currently working on the team literature review. Since I’m busy juggling school and extracurricular work, I don’t really have much spare time for fun. However, when I do get a few minutes to myself, I enjoy lattes, jogging, and Canadian bacon. Sometimes I even read for fun. I aspire to go on from my bachelor’s degree to become either an environmental or human rights lawyer.

Besides my interest in RNA and synthetic biology, I enjoy playing music, reading, golfing and spending time with family.

5th Year, Neuroscience
I enjoy studying protein biosynthesis and my favorite biomolecule is RNA. As with every year in iGEM I look forward to the Jamboree, as it is an opportunity to meet people from around the world and learn about their unique projects. I am also the vice president of the Synthetic Biology club and enjoy playing Starcraft in my spare time (Masters League). I am an expert at creating ""Rhys"" puns and think of them whenever I can find time (Rhycently, Rhyspect, Rhysist, Rhysese pieces, Rhysults, Rhysearch station).

Post Doctoral Fellow
I'm a Postdoctoral Fellow  at Alberta RNA Research and Training Institute, University of Lethbridge.  I combine my medical background (Clinical Biochemist and  Medical Lab Tech) and my computation biology skills to study biomolecules with a special focus on structured RNAs.
I got my PhD degree in Molecular Biophysics from Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru, India where I used computational approaches to understand the  structure of RNA duplexes at base pair level. As an outcome of the project, I developed a program (Molbridge) and also two web servers. My Master thesis was on the effect of preprocessing on blood serum and plasma Clinical analytes. I am  interested in Science policy and advocacy. I like to dance and enjoy hiking in my free time."

UPMC-Paris Team Attributions :
Team members :
Brainstorming :
In short everyone
Fund raising :
HelloAsso page designed by Wilhelm and share on social networks by all members. Emails sent to tons of companies by all members with Florent leading us at first. Meetings with companies and “Interviews” for various public funding decisions with who was available (especially Florent, Wilhelm, Nassim, Benjamin and Kévin)
Recrutement :
Perwin and Djamila
Interviews :
Pretty much the ones available
Experiments :
Everyone helped on the Concept and Protocols before June. June-August was the preparation and the start of the manipulations. It was mostly done by Nassim, Wilhelm, Sofiane, Djamila, Kévin and Benjamin. September-October manipulations were mainly done by Nassim and Wilhelm. Our favorite undergrad, Zinebe, was mostly initiated by us to most techniques, but she also did the survey creation along with Sofiane.
Our logo, T shirts and banner :
Design was done mostly by Wilhelm helped by Nassim, Kevin did the project logo.
Our Wiki :
Design was done mostly by Benjamin with some tweaks from Kévin, Wilhelm, Nassim, Sofiane and Guillaume, an outsider of the team.
Translations (French to/from English) :
It was done by everyone, but Djamila, Benjamin, Wilhelm and Sofiane did most
Supervisors :
We are extremely grateful for our AMAZING supervisors without whom we wouldn’t have gotten so far! They not only helps us for the fundraising in term of sharing our HelloAsso page (a crowdfunding platform) among their colleagues and social networks, but also helped us get funds from one of our school department. They were readily available for any advice on our projects, and constantly reminded us of deadlines. They also reached among their network and beyond whenever there was a scientific question that was not in their expertise area, or for bacteria we needed.
On top of all of this they provided us with any material they could for our labs (cones, reagents, restrictions enzymes, buffers, medium prep necessary, gloves, wipes…). Dr. Peronnet even allowed us to use the nanodrop in her lab and to performed transformation with their competent DH5α for ligated DNA samples.
They were there from the beginning and have been extremely resourceful and helpful and for that we would like to thank them again and again.
General Support :
We obtained our Bacillus subtilis strains from Dr. John Helmann from the US, Dr. Mohamed Marahiel from Germany and Dr. Hugonnet Jean Emmanuel from France. The IONIS team gave us some competent E. coli DH5α , for whom we are all grateful. We want to thank all of our sponsors, especially the FSDIE and BMC department from UPMC and its director, Mrs. Louvet-Vallée, but also the FSIE from UPEC and Servier for their significant financial support.
We also want to thank everyone who accepted to be interviewed by us, and/or who took part in our surveys, to those who supported us on the HelloAsso page and to everyone else who helped us with our problems, especially Pr. Delmas for attending our group meetings and giving us feedback concerning our project."

University of Oslo
We are all studying at the University of Oslo, which is the leading university in Norway and includes 8 different faculties. It was funded in 1811 and has more than 27 000 students and 6000 employees. The University lies in the capital of Norway, Oslo, and the buildings are spread all over the city. But the largest part is located in a ""Blindern"". We have our lab located at Blindern, Kristine Bonnevies house, Department of Biosciences.
Oslo is the capital of Norway, but also Norway's largest city. It has more than 650 000 inhabitants; this include many students that move to Oslo to get an education. Students in Norway are very fortunate; We study for free! Everyone can get a scholarship or a student loan.
Collaborations
Collaboration with K-Res in Tromsø
We were so fortunate to collaborate with scientists at the Center of National Expertise Service for the Detection of Antibiotic Resistance (K- res). We received clinical isolates of different ESBL-strains, accompanied with their ESBL-genes sequence information. These strains were used to test our detection method described in the “lab-section” of the wiki.
Nordic iGEM Conference
We joined the NiC which took part in the end of June 2016 in Stockholm. The conference was hosted by the winning team of last year NiC mini jamboree - iGEM Stockholm. Not only was this a great platform to exchange ideas between teams, but also a valuable social event where the Nordic teams also get to become friends. We attended workshop regarding ethics and speculative design where we at the latter got to think outside the box about synthetic biology. During the mini-jamboree we got valuable feedback from the judges, interesting question from the audience, and important experience by presenting our project. Good luck this year winner, iGEM Leiden, with hosting NiC next year!
Norway iGEM Conference
We initiated a mini-conference with the second Norwegian team, iGEM NTNU, 23-24th September. The conference was held at the Science Library at University of Oslo. We presented our projects in front of three judges that provided us with valuable feedback before the giant jamboree in Boston.
The Norwegian Biotechnology Advisory Board attended our conference and we are scheduled to appear on their GENialt magazine website. We hope this is a beginning of a new tradition that the Norwegian teams of next year will honor and bring to the next level.
Collaboration with team iGEM NTNU
After learning more about each other project we were interested in figuring out how we could help each other out. We discussed at the Norway iGEM Conference about how we further could collaborate and both teams were interested to see if the results could be generated in another lab.
We transformed TOP10 competent cells with plasmids (1-4) provided by the NTNU team. Preferably we should have transformed DH5α cells to meet NTNUs wishes, but we did not have these available in the lab at this point. We got instruction to plate the transformed cells on LB agar plates with ampicillin added. Unfortunately, not all transformations grew and we ended up with bacteria transformed with plasmid “1” and “4”.
Experimental setup:
The NTNU team gave us guidelines of how to conduct the experiment.  Grow overnight cultures with LB medium, ampicillin and one bacteria colony at 37°C. Transfer the overnight culture to different incubation temperatures (30,37 and 41°C) and 200 rpm. This correlates to the experiment start point at 0 hours.
Check if there is any color change in the different temperature settings
Results:
We did not observe any visible color change in any of the different setups with either plasmid “1” or “4”.
Team iGEM NTNU also helped us out by performing an experiment with our protocol regarding use of Nitrocefin to test ampicillin-resistant E. coli and regular E. coli without any antibiotic resistance. During our experiments, these bacteria have been our positive and negative control, respectively. By following our protocol and filling in a provided excel-sheet they provided us with data that resulted to this graph. Although operating with different scales, the data provided by the NTNU team shows the same trends as our data indicate. The values in this provided dataset is significantly higher, and this could for example be due to the sensitivity of the instruments(spectrophotometer) used.
We want to thank team NTNU for the collaboration and a wonderful time at the first Norway iGEM Conference.

We are only 7 members on the team. Even so, we did most of the work ourselves. Torleif, Marthe and Ragnhild spent hours after hours in the lab. And after a lot of frustration, sweat and even some tears they managed to finish the project on time right before the due date. We have two informatics students on the team, Roza and Paul. Roza designed her first webpage (our wiki) almost alone and she did a really good job. Camilla helped her a lot on the wiki and she edited the images for the wiki. Hans made a supercool 3D-printed model on his own and he even did the electrics by himself.
Despite this, we did got some help and this page is dedicated to you. Thank you all for helping us, in one way or another. This project wouldn’t have happened without you!

(not pictured) We would also like to thank Anthony ""TJ"" Ciesla, a graduate of the Duke Biomedical Engineering Department and former iGEM president, for laying out the design groundwork and preliminary research for creating the necessary sequences for the taxol enzyme pathway.
Our entire project’s conceptualization and realization was completed entirely by our undergrad team. Our graduate student and faculty mentors helped us by teaching how to use advanced lab equipment and perform advanced techniques. When our undergrad team ran into problems, mentors were available to help guide us through troubleshooting but any new direction taken was entirely of the students’ creation."

Each team must clearly attribute work done by the student team members on this page. The team must distinguish work done by the students from work done by others, including the host labs, advisors, instructors, and individuals not on the team roster.
Why is this page needed?
The Attribution requirement helps the judges know what you did yourselves and what you had help with. We don't mind if you get help with difficult or complex techniques, but you must report what work your team did and what work was done by others.
For example, you might choose to work with an animal model during your project. Working with animals requires getting a license and applying far in advance to conduct certain experiments in many countries. This is difficult to achieve during the course of a summer, but much easier if you can work with a postdoc or PI who has the right licenses.
What should this page have?
General Support
Project support and advice
Fundraising help and advice
Lab support
Difficult technique support

About us
Our goal for project φῶς is to create a cheap and easy to use book light that uses bioluminescent bacteria as a light source. When we started brainstorming for a project, we knew that we wanted to do something with bioluminescent bacteria, since we had previously used fluorescent bacteria we felt inclined to try something that glows on it’s own. We started to think about what kind of applications bioluminescent bacteria could have in Peru. Meanwhile, a member told us a shocking statistic: There are 2.7 million people in Peru that do not have an access to electricity and have no way to light their homes. We realized that if we could create a bioluminescent bacteria that could bright enough, it could be used to light a home! However, we knew that being able to light an entire home using only bacteria was a significant challenge. Eventually, we decided to that make a reading lamp which was a more realistic goal.
David Lin
My name is David Lin and I’m a 16 year old student at Colegio FDR. I was born in Jinanxi, China and have lived in Lima, Peru for more than 8 years. As a science enthusiast, I find the topic of genetic engineering and synthetic biology fascinating. I believe that through this area of science, mankind will undergo great progress and create countless innovative solutions. My passion for science has always been a defining feature of my academic career and personal philosophy. It has influenced my future career choices and helped me learn more about this amazing world. This is why I have joined iGEM, my goal is to learn more about these areas of science through experimentation and creation.
​A fun fact about me is that I share a common interest in mechanical engineering, for I have constructed a functional motorcycle for the MYP Personal Project.
Fernando Zavala
Hello, my name is Fernando Zavala, I am 16 years old, and I am a student here at FDR, American school of Lima.  I was born in Lima, Peru in the year 1999, but I moved to New York at the age of 5, and I lived there for 8 years. Recently, I moved back to Lima about 3 years ago, and I am so grateful to have become a part of this new FDR school community. In terms of science, I have always had a passion for it ever since we did physics and biology in the 5th grade and it has been growing and accumulating ever since. I found it so fascinating how anyone could practice it, and, with a little critical thinking and dedication, could bring something new to the table, making us more knowledgeable about the world around us, and advance our society. However, personally I have always been at a crossroads between physics and biology. I love the perspective of physics and how it breaks everything down fundamentally to understand the world and its processes, and that’s what I chose as an IB subject. But I also love how biology deals with the details and blueprints of real, living things, and how it impacts me on a much more personal level (since it makes me more intellectual about my own body), and I didn’t want to miss out on not knowing what the biology road would have been like. So that’s why I joined iGEM. To help me make the decision about which career path I want to take by enriching me in some of the best genetic engineering work done at this school.
Fun Facts: I play basketball, soccer and football extensively, I play the trumpet for the school’s jazz band, and in my free time I like to skateboard outside and DJ in my room.
Sofia Gonzalez
My name is Sofia Gonzalez, I’m 16 years old and currently a junior at Colegio Franklin Delano Roosevelt in Lima, Peru. I was born in Lima, but lived in Chile for 6 years before coming back to Peru. Ever since I took an Anatomy & Physiology course in the summer of 8th grade I’ve had a very strong interest in science– specifically biology and chemistry. Last year for science class we had to conduct our own original lab, and I chose to research the effect of UVA exposure on planaria (flatworms). This project sparked my interest in scientific research, and in the future I hope to pursue this passion by studying biology in college. I joined iGEM because I find synthetic biology fascinating and with the hope of being able to make a difference in the world through science.
Jae Hee Kim
Hi, I’m Jae Hee Kim and I’m a 9th grade Korean student that goes to Colegio Franklin Delano Roosevelt in Lima, Peru. My interest in genetic engineering comes from when I read a book about genetic modification a few years ago. I was fascinated once again when I learnt about biology in school in 7th grade. I joined iGEM in hope to find out more about synthetic biology. I tried, in vain, to come up with a fun fact about myself, only to find out that I might be one of the most boring people you might come across in your life.
Luis Matteo De Bernardis
Hi! My name is Luis Matteo De Bernardis. I am a 16-year-old junior in Colegio Roosevelt who has lived here for all my life. Living in Peru has been the land of opportunities: there is always room to help or do a certain project that will cause a good to the society, one way or the other. Through my constant endeavors, I have managed to acquire the strong interest for sciences in general, focusing my aim on my future as a doctor. By going to hospitals to help and understand the children who sometimes even live there I try to understand my passion for being to not only help others, but understand myself; how different am I from those kids who have to live with a disease such as cancer? I believe that iGEM will be able to be a practical opportunity to submerge myself into the scientific world and have even a small glimpse as to how the human life which we learn about all the time is able to function.
Daniel Sanchez
My name is Daniel Sanchez and I am 16 years old. I am Peruvian and American. I am a student Colegio Franklin Delano Roosevelt the American school of Lima. Biology has always interested me and I think that synthetic biology is an area where many breakthroughs are occurring. iGem seemed like a great way to explore my interests.
Fun Facts: I have played different sports throughout my life including lacrosse, soccer, and football. I have also been playing the trumpet for many years.
Riah Kim
Hi! I am Riah Kim from South Korea and I’m currently a freshman. This is my first year at FDR, but I came to Peru last year, 2014. Before I came here, I have lived my entire life in South Korea. I am interested in all sciences, but especially in genetic and computer engineering. The main reason why I joined iGEM is because I want to learn more about synthetic biology and genetic engineering. In addition, I hope to study engineering in university and become an engineer in the future. I think iGEM is going to be one of my best experiences during my high school years. I’m looking forward to experience many things and learn by doing various experiments.Fun Facts:Traveling other countries and playing violin, piano are one of my favorite things to do. I also enjoy solving the Rubik’s cube, especially 3*3*3 and 4*4*4 cube.
Ayoon Kim
My name is Ayoon Kim and I am a freshman at Colegio Franklin Delano Roosevelt. I was born in Arizona, United States. However, I mostly lived in South Korea and Canada my entire life.I have recently gained an interest in science and biology; the more I learned about science and biology, the more fascinating it became. At first, I had no idea what iGEM and genetic engineering was, but when I found out, I thought it would be really cool and interesting to try out something new, so I decided to join in. I am looking forward to learn a lot in iGEM. Fun Facts:I like baking chocolate chip cookies and red velvet cakes."

Thus, we will attempt to candidly describe how our project evolved, which student was responsible for which sub-project, and who supported our project with scientific or non-scientific contributions.
Finding the biotINK project
For the story of finding our project, it is essential to know that there was no iGEM team from either TUM or LMU in 2015 and no team at TUM in 2014. Thus, each of these years saw students wanting to participate in the iGEM competition but facing the bleak perspective that there was no hosting lab that offered the support necessary to make the ""iGEM experience"". For this long a time, students have brainstormed in order to find interesting ideas that they could convert into an iGEM project. Likewise, the idea for our bioprinting project is far older than just this year – at least in theory. The life science students finally assembled around last February, eagerly suggesting various ideas for several promising potential iGEM projects that they had in mind. The project ideas that were developed most involved i) transforming the planet Mars with bacteria, ii) creating a vegan substitution product for milk, and iii) bioprinting. While we considered the bioprinting project to be the most intriguing idea, last year's TU Delft iGEM team had unfortunately already developed an excellent project on bioprinting. Thus began a long discussion of whether it would be in our team's best interests to participate with another bioprinting project. In the end, however, we agreed that the next years of iGEM will most likely witness the establishment of a separate bioprinting track and that this topic has extraordinary potential. By the way, it was much encouraging to listen to Randy in Paris when he described the potential of SynBio and chose bioprinting of organs for an example! At this point, our last doubts melted, and we were wholly confident that our project choice was just right.
Our principal investigators (PIs)
As implied above, it was very difficult to convince a professor at TUM of an iGEM participation, and at LMU as well it was cumbersome to find a PI enthusiastic about iGEM now that Prof. Mascher has left Munich. The initial motivation to found this year's iGEM team was sparked by the Graduate Center GRK 2062: Molecular principles of synthetic biology, which desired to re-establish the iGEM competition in Munich.
Prof. Dr. Jung (one of our secondary PIs, LMU) is the head of this graduate center and thus impulsed the creation of a team by recruiting students. Wanting to share the project she (and the GRK) looked for a lab participating in the graduate center that could host the iGEM team as main lab. During the summer we had access to lab space in her department, where we could perform cloning  steps and other work. This was of great help, as the distance between LMU and TUM at Weihenstephan Campus is more than 2 h with public transportation. We are grateful for Prof. Jung's support even though towards the end we decided to rejoin into our main lab.
Prof. Dr. Skerra (our main PI, TUM) already filled the role of the main PI of TUM's 2012 and 2013 iGEM teams and thus had the first-hand experience of what it means to host an iGEM team. Initially, he was disinclined to host yet another iGEM team at his lab, but finally we could convince him of this. He is a renowned expert in the field of protein design, especially for therapeutic proteins, and has also founded two successful companies. For this reason, he is quite busy and unable invest great amounts of time in the iGEM competition. He joined our weekly team meeting once after we had decided on our project, giving us several invaluable tips concerning what components to integrate and what aspects to focus on in order to arrive at a proof of principle in the end. Apart from this session with him, it is his philosophy that iGEM is a student's  competition and that the students themselves should design and create the project. He generously offered all of the resources available at his chair together with the excellent analytical equipment, while letting us free rein to plan and execute the project on our own – and we are very grateful that he provided us with this opportunity!
Prof. Dr. Westmeyer (secondary PI, TUM, Helmholtz center) was asked to join the team halfway through the project when we realized that we required his expertise in the field of fluorescence microscopic imaging. He supported us, especially in the final weeks, with cell-biological reagents for staining and transfection as well as with the analytical instrumentation of his lab. As he spent the last years in Boston at the MIT and at Harvard, he is very open-minded concerning the potential and possible applications of SynBio in the future.
Our Journey Through Munich
In the course of our project, we have met many nice people willing to help and support us with lab space, knowledge, or materials. Below you can find all the stations we stopped by throughout our journey up to the outcome of our project.

Attributions sorted by methods
All work associated with planning, conducting, and evaluating experiments was performed by student members of our team. Instructors assisted the students in planning their experiments, introducing relevant molecular-biological and chemical techniques to the students when they performed a specific experiment for the first time. Moreover, the students evaluated the experiments themselves after an introduction to the theory and advice on what to do and what to avoid. After this preliminary evaluation, all data were accumulated and discussed in the weekly team meeting, at which our two instructors Andreas and Volker (both PhD students at the lab of Prof. Skerra) were present to reflect on our project. Here we enumerate the specific tasks as well as the student(s) who performed them in order to allow the judges to directly contact the student responsible for a topic of interest.
Protein Production and Purification
As we produced, purified, conjugated, and analyzed many different protein samples, several team members were involved, including Niklas, Jan and Julian. Shaker flask productions were conducted independently of other lab members; for fermentation (which turned out to be a somewhat more difficult than explained in lectures), one of our instuctors had an eye on the whole production. Purification with normal columns was performed independently; for those involving the Äkta purifier, a lab member supervised our handling for the first 3 to 5 chromatographies.
Molecular Cloning
In the first week, we received an introduction to molecular cloning. Afterwards, we worked independently of our instructors and only asked them from time to time whenever a problem occurred. The gene design for all BioBricks was conceptualized by a student member (often Clemens or Christoph) and then reviewed by our instructor Volker.
Western Blot
All Western Blots were done by Luisa, and she received an introduction to blotting and staining from Fabian Rodewald and Christian Deuschle.
Mass spectrometric measurements
The correctness of recombinant proteins before and after conjugation was analyzed by ESI-TOF mass spectrometry. Samples were prepared by student members of the team, the actual measurement was performed by a technical assistant (which is also true for PhD students).
Determination of mRNA levels with RT-q-PCR
To further characterize the expression of the different receptor constructs our team wanted to take a closer look at the respective mRNA levels. In order to do so we asked Professor Dr. Pfaffl for help, since he is one of the leading experts for quantitative PCR. Together with him we were able to find the right approach to solving our problem. We want to thank Professor Dr. Pfaffl for his advice and for supplying the lab space for conducting our experiments. We also want to thank one of his PhD students, Dominik Buschmann, for helping us with the experiments and the analysis of the gathered data.
Incubation facility
The hypoxia experiments could only be performed thanks to the support of the Schwille Group at the Max-Planck Institute of Biochemistry in Martinsried, which kindly provided the required incubation facility. In this context, we are indebted to Tobias Härtel and Bea, who always offered their invaluable advice and help. The hypoxia experiments were performed by Jan and Elena, who were ready to take samples every 12 hours.
Flow Cytometry
The flow cytometry experiments were all performed by Luisa as she spent 18 months in a research group in Hamburg before she started her studies in Munich, thus already versed in all skills necessary to measure our cells in FACS.
Fluorescence Microscopy
Fluorescence microscopy at the lab of Prof. Skerra was performed by different people as it was necessary for many different sub-projects. High-resolution confocal fluorescence microscopy was conducted at the Helmholtz Center in Munich in the lab of Prof. Westmeyer by Christoph as he will also do his master's thesis in this lab. He received the introduction into staining cells and performing confocal imaging experiments from our external Instructor Jeff.
Scanning Electron Microscopy
Our colorful Scanning Electron Microscopy images were shot by Prof. Dr. Wanner from the Plant Science Department of the Ludwig-Maximilians University. Elena approached him to support our project in terms of a collaboration to provide us impressive electron microscopy images of cells. Prof. Wanner supplied all reagents required for sample preparation, such as microscopic slides, glutaraldehyde, transport boxes and many more! Clemens was in charge of preparing the samples late in the evening, which were thus slightly improvised. The samples were then picked up and transported by Jan and Elena to the SEM facility.  Afterwards, the remaining sample preparation steps after the fixation were carried out by Prof. Wanner and his coworkers. We are sincerely grateful for his support!
Blood samples
For our ""linker chemistry"" subproject, we needed fresh blood samples as a readily available source of human biotinidase in the form of plasma. For this purpose, Vivien, the student who performed the chemical experiments, utilized her own blood graciously drawn by PD Dr. med. Thomas Skurk, a medical doctor at the Institute for Food & Health.
Chemical synthesis of Biotin-NHS active esters
Chemical synthesis was performed by Vivien, as she wrote her bachelor's thesis at the Chair of Organic Chemistry at TUM. The initial synthesis plan was discussed with Dr. Martin Dauner, who is the chemist in the lab of Prof. Skerra. Vivien worked alone afterwards in synthesizing the target compounds and subsequently analyzing their properties. The NMR experiments were then measured at the Faculty of Chemistry in Garching. Vivien evaluated all results (including NMR).
Maya Video
To be honest, we are very proud that the Maya Video Vivien built looks so great in the end. Initial renderings that she showed to the team were far more simple than the final product. She had already gathered some experience in 3D animating, having regularly worked with Blender as a hobby before; this helped her very much in understanding the Maya software faster (which is really not that intuitive). She also compiled a How-To Video in which she explains the creation of the video in just short of one hour. If you are interested in the video, please ask her, as she really did it on her own ;)
As there was no PDB file available from the PAS-polypeptide we asked the Junior-PI Dr. Andre Schiefner at the Chair of Biological Chemistry (TUM) for help. As an experienced christallographer he was able to create a PAS(200) sequence with lysines that could be used later on for the creation of the PAS animation.
Micromanipulator experiments
Figure 1: Javier operating the micromanipulator
We thank Professor Dr. Schnieke and her of Livestock Biotechnology at the WZW (TUM School of Life Sciences Weihenstephan) for so generously providing us with the opportunity to use the micromanipulator at the chair's laboratory and allowing us to conduct several highly specific experiments with our bioink. With the extensive help and instructions of Dr. Nicolas Ortega,  a researcher at the lab having much experience with the device, we were able to plan experiments and test our bioprinting technique on a minuscule scale. In the process, our team members Julian and Javier were able to observe the ejection process under controlled conditions in great detail and document the behavior of our modified HEK cells containing ink. Thanks to this opportunity we could obtain useful and valuable visual material as well as a better understanding of our biotINK concept.
Business plan
The business plan was written by Christoph as he also studies TUM Economics besides his studies in Molecular Biotechnology.
Survey: ""Supporting Entrepreneurship""
For the creation of this survey, we had a special Instructor, Philipp. He is a PhD student an the Chair of Technology and  Innovations Management. He supervised Hallie, an exchange student from the USA who joined our team to create this survey and elucidate how we can make iGEM more productive concerning its output in successful start-up companies.
The Wiki
The Wiki was programmed by Peter, a student in Media Informatics (LMU). As we encountered some problems finding someone to program the Wiki, he joined the team 4 weeks before wiki freeze. As he also works in web design and completed his bachelor's thesis in parallel, he was quite busy and did not have overly much time (which is why we finalized our CSS on the last evening). In the end, though, he successfully completed the work.
Video cutting
All work associated with recording as well as processing auto and video files was done by Julian.

TEAM
For better environment
Overview
We are a group of enthusiastic and persistent Chinese students from Nanjing University. We started our iGEM tour as sophomores and seniors in 2015. At first, most of us were unfamiliar with synthetic biology and relevant experimental skills in molecular biology. However, we made the resolution to face this challenging but rewarding course.
 
Our team consists of students from Life Science Department and College of Engineering and Applied Sciences. The interdisciplinary team has made it possible to fully realize our vision due to a variety of special skills we harbor. We have tried to make the most of everyone’s strengths when assigning tasks, yet each team member still have the chance to keep learning something new.
 
The iGEM competition is truly an once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for us to get fully involved in scientific research, from coming up with a new idea, operating experiments to carrying out human practices, designing wiki and posters. During the past year, it has become our daily routine to meet up with each other, brainstorming to polish our project. What we have gained during this period of time is not only professional knowledge, but also enthusiasm for science and how to work as a team.
 
Other than every incredible team member, we have also received amazing support from our advisors, instructors and sponsors.
 
Here comes our team profile.

As a team of high school students, we are sincerely grateful for all the help we’ve received from our PI, Mr. Zhao Huan, who taught us through the basics of molecular biology, lectured to us about lab safety, and have always been there for us to provide guidance on all problems we encountered.
Our school doesn't have a fund for iGEM teams, so we raised money to pay for registration through Crowdfunding, an online platform, and received a generous sponsorship from Due West Education.
Inevitably there are some parts of the experiment that can’t be done in our school’s molecular lab, and we are thankful for Dr. Wang Miao from the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Science and his lab for letting us purify proteins and do measurement, and complete our InterLab Study there.
As we sought to connect our project with the real world, Dr. Meng Lu and Dr. Wang Jiaqi from the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Science strengthened our Human Practice section by accepting our interview and helping us schedule a visit to Sanyuan Milk Group, with a guide explaining every step of the process in the plant.
Also, we want to give special thanks to everyone that pitched in our crowdfunding, and all teachers in SDSZ international education department and biology faculty for supporting us throughout the year!

Synthetic Biology Course
In 2015 and 2016 EMW Street Bio has been a site and home for the international course, ""How To Grow                     (Almost) Anything"" , a synthetic biology course directed by Professor George Church of                     Harvard                     University, with our PI serving as faculty and program manager. Many of the students in the team                     took the course last year and two are taking it this year. The 2016 syllabus can be found here: http://bio.academany.org/doc/classes .
We started brainstorming for our iGEM project idea in May 2016 based on what we learned in this                     course, but focusing on hardware components. In September, we decided to build Biota Beats.

EMW Street Bio
Biology is humanity’s next technology revolution. The ability to re-engineer life on our                             planet                             has profound implications, from reshaping how we produce the medicine, materials, and energy                             we                             depend on, to augmenting humankind itself. Yet, the infrastructure for biological                             engineering,                             from organism design tools to DNA assembly to organism implementation, is nascent and                             largely                             confined to the laboratories of academia and corporations. Thus, we have an incredible                             opportunity, as the infrastructure for our bio-economy is being constructed, to move                             biological                             technologies from ivory towers and corporations to the street—to the youth, to the misfits                             at the edges of culture, to the communities that never dreamed of biology as a medium for                             creative                             expression.
Although Cambridge is an international hub for biotech, there is a disconnect between the                             science                             and the public. With Street Bio at EMW (East Meets West - a hub for technology, arts, and                             activism), we explore the interface between engineered biology and the street—the people,                             culture, and products that will shape how biology leaves the lab and enters our everyday                             lives.                             The concept was conceived in Summer 2015 by Dr. David Kong, a graduate of the MIT Media Lab                             who                             currently conducts synthetic biology, microfluidics, and digital fabrication research at                             MIT’s                             Lincoln Laboratory. Over the year students and professionals have joined the movement to                             create                             a biohacking space that was much needed in Cambridge.

Project Start & Team Training
The Lubbock_TTU Team is part of a student organization at Texas Tech University known as iGEM Raiders. We are a first year iGEM team composed of 14 dedicated undergraduate and graduate students with backgrounds in microbiology, animal science, cell and molecular biology, biochemistry, mathematics, physics, and chemical, mechanical, and electrical engineering. To help ease the learning curve we developed and participated in an iGEM Bootcamp to cover the basics of molecular biology, the principles of synthetic biology, iGEM specific criteria, essential lab techniques, and safety training. The schedule for the iGEM Bootcamp can be viewed here .
Team Contributions
Brandon Palomo started the first year TTU iGEM team and acted as the team leader for the group. He played a critical role in team management, establishing connections, and developing outreach activities. He also developed the collagen scaffold for the wound dressing to be tested on chronic wound mouse models.
Cody Fell has served as the Vice President of the TTU iGEM team. As a wet lab member, he has designed expression vectors as well as our PDGF and Aprotinin Biobricks.

The UMass Dartmouth iGEM team was formed in May of 2016. It began with the creation of the Synthetic Biology club, lead by undergraduate bioengineering students Austin Nykiel, Alexander Halliwell, Kevin Beshara-Flynn, and biology student Shao-Chieh Chen. Under the guidance of Dr. Christopher Brigham and Jacob Palmer, M.S., the group decided to dive into the scarcely studied waters of RNA thermometers. As the group pursued its research, it was met with the addition of several more undergraduate students looking to contribute to the project.

Emilia Broman
Bioinformation Technology at Aalto University
In the beginning of the project I did a lot of fundraising and budgeting to make sure that the financial side of the project was taken care of. That followed by many hours spent on coding the CollabSeeker. I have also taken care of the visual part of our project, designing our wiki, posters etc. And finally, thanks to the InterLab study I did not have to spend the whole summer staring at my laptop!
I joined iGEM because I enjoy learning new things, and that's what iGEM is all about!
Hele Haapaniemi
Biosystems and Biomaterials Engineering at Aalto University
I have been doing mostly research and lab work related to the detection part of our project. Especially yeast transformations and catalase assays have become familiar during the summer. Besides this I have been presenting our project to many companies and tried to learn to code our wiki page.
I wanted to experience something new and learn more about synthetic biology. Work in a research project that is planned and realized by only ourselves sounded cool. And it was!
Saara Hiltunen
Bioinformation Technology at Aalto University
I was kind of a jack of all trades in the team. The beginning of the summer I mostly concentrated on funding and organizing our trips to Stockholm and Paris. Since then my responsibilities have also included coding wiki and Collabseeker, designing and some lab stuff.
I joined iGEM because it is a great opportunity to apply my interdisciplinary studies in the field of synthetic biology and learn loads of new things.
Rashad Ismayilzada
Bioinformatics at Aalto University
I joined iGEM to learn more about biology and lab work. I also wanted to participate in a project that incorporated in itself multifarious activities, such as fundraising, business development, research, lab work, modeling and programming.
My main contribution was helping to gather funds for the team and I can proudly say that we managed to do it well. Simultaneously, I was involved in human practices and public outreach. I also got to do some lab work and was in charge of the Interlab study. I would say in iGEM I learned to be more patient and rediscovered the meaning of perseverance.
Antti Koistinen
Biotechnology at Aalto University
I have mostly been working in lab with many projects including fluorescent protein testing in yeast and constructing our biobricks. I also did some modelling since somebody needs to teach biology to the mathematicians.
When I heard that you could be a part of research project where designing and execution is done by students I knew this is something I want to participate in. A little bit more researching about previous year's iGEM projects, and the opportunities of synthetic biology got me completely hooked.
Laura Laiho
Molecular Biosciences at the University of Helsinki
In the background research and lab I constituted one half of the degradation team. Outside the lab I, as our team captain, tried to keep everything on track and make sure that we were getting stuff done. I also held presentations to companies and drew the pictures for our introduction video.
I joined iGEM because I wanted to do something awesome, learn new stuff and see what a team full of students can achieve - a lot apparently! I came to iGEM knowing quite little about synthetic biology, but now I am confident that my future career will be in this field of science.
Nidia Obscura
Mathematics at the University of Helsinki
I worked on the modelling of the detecting mechanism of our project. I modelled mathematically the potential activity of our promoters and their mechanisms through a theoretical model and some simulations.
I joined IGEM to learn more about the state of the art in synthetic biology and how mathematics could be of help in a task -I thought- so distant. I was pretty excited of applying my knowledge in a very interdisciplinary team.
Pihla Savola
Biotechnology and Chemical Technology at Aalto University
My main responsibility has been to make sure everything is moving forward in the lab. This has meant lots of lab planning, background research and experiment design, as well as making sure lab work is distributed and everyone knows what to do. And of course, plenty of the actual lab work too!
I wanted to work on an independent, challenging research project where I could apply what I know and do lots of problem-solving, so a student-driven team project seemed like a good fit. And I wanted to learn more about synthetic biology, which made iGEM an even better match!
Snehadri Sinha
Molecular Biosciences at the University of Helsinki
I have been doing background research and working in the lab, focusing on the degradation part of the project. It has been a summer of growth media and Western blots for me. Other than that, I worked on presentations and the introduction video.
I joined iGEM because the opportunity to work in a trendy field like synthetic biology and that too in a student-led team seemed too good to miss! It’s one of the best decisions I have taken this year. During the hours spent in the lab I learnt much about time management and planning. After iGEM I have a newfound enthusiasm for facing challenges.
Jami Valorinta
Mathematics at the University of Helsinki
Spring 2016. I saw a poster in the hallways of Kumpula, advertising a synthetic biology competition I had never heard of. I was     a mathematician with only a vague idea of what synthetic biology even meant, so of course I immediately applied... and got chosen!
In the team I've mostly been doing everything related to computers. I'm the guy responsible for our website, the backend of the CollabSeeker,     and the WikiFire+ tool used by our wiki group. I also did modelling and helped with the numerical simulations, and the others even let me into     the lab a couple of times. It's really been a great summer!

Our instructor, Heli Viskari, is a university lectuer in Aalto University. She has been helping us with various everyday problems throughout the summer. She was the instructor also for the previous Aalto-Helsinki team.
Acknowledgements
We would like to start with thanking Markus Linder , the primary PI of our project. He has been there for us right from the start, introducing us to the ways of iGEM and guiding us through the brainstorming and initial research stages. He helped us get in touch with experts and also arranged for some of our funding. We held weekly meetings with him almost during the whole project and got valuable advice on many matters. During different stages of the project we had several ideas on which direction to proceed in - he helped us recognize the more important things to focus on. He has also encouraged independent thinking amongst ourselves to maintain the student-driven aspect of the project. Lately, he has helped us a lot in preparing for the Giant Jamboree. His support has been invaluable in our iGEM journey.
Heli Viskari was our instructor and also there for us from the beginning. She answered all questions related to the lab and also arranged the lab space for us - important for carrying out for our experiments! She helped with the flow cytometer instrument and setup. She also regularly gave her input on our results and the progress of our project.
Merja Penttilä (VTT) encouraged us to think outside the box in our brainstorming sessions. As the secondary PI of our project, she gave us advice and direction when designing our project idea.
We had the opportunity to talk to Kaarina Sivonen and her cyanobacteria research group at the University of Helsinki. They really helped us by answering our questions, providing us with the cyanobacteria we used in our experiments and by analysing our enzyme activity samples. We were in contact especially with David Fewer , who is a researcher at the group. He helped us in planning the project and provided useful research articles. With his input we were able to design and carry out various laboratory experiments. Also, the group’s laboratory technician, Matti Wahlsten , helped us tremendously and we are very grateful to him for analysing all of our enzyme activity samples (there was a lot of them). He also gave us the safety training concerning working with the toxins and the cyanobacteria and how to handle and dispose of them. Without Matti’s help, we would have had to come up with some different way of analysing the enzyme activity in our samples, which most likely would have given us less time to spend on doing other things in the lab. As a gesture of thanks we decided to name the main character in our introduction video as Matti.
In addition to our official advisors and the cyanobacteria research group, we would like to acknowledge the following people for their contribution to our project:
Jussi Jäntti (VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland) attended many of our brainstorming sessions and advised us, especially on the use yeast as a chassis. He also gave advice on designing transporters and the choice of fluorescent protein for the detection.
Alexander Frey (Aalto University) helped solve many of our problems related to yeast. He advised on signal sequences for our construct design. He also helped us with the choice of yeast strain and provided us with protocols for some of the yeast lab work.
Jorg de Ruijter (Aalto University) helped us tremendously with various everyday problems, especially with yeast-related work. He gave us yeast protocols and answered our questions about them, and advised on things to take into account in designing several of our yeast experiments. He also gave advice on yeast strains, plasmids, and designing the genome integration of the transporters.
Pezhman Mohammadi (Aalto University) was the go-to person whenever we faced problems with protein work, be it in the practical work or designing the experiment. He gave us useful advice on protein purification and helped choose parameters for FPLC. He advised us on homology modeling, codon optimization for the enzyme production, and also helped order the enzyme constructs.
Georg Schmidt (Aalto University) has answered questions we had relating to DNA constructs design, and was the go-to person for any questions on cloning. He also helped us with PCR troubleshooting and advised on things to take into account with our microplate reader assay.
Dominik Mojzita (VTT) gave us advice related to stress reactions and yeast strain choices. He provided valuable input on yeast stress response, choice of linkers, enzyme activity controls, and also suggested the use of flow cytometry.
Mari Piirainen (Aalto University) helped us with practical problems related to yeast, and also taught us how to use a flow cytometer.
Anssi Rantasalo (VTT) helped us with designing our transporter constructs and gave general advice on flow cytometry and analyzing the results.
Merja Oja (VTT) introduced us to the field of modelling and helped give direction to our modellers.
Ion Petre (Åbo Akademi) oriented us further into modelling and provided us with helpful example programs and models for our project.
Sami Havukainen (Aalto University) gave valuable advice us on choice of yeast strain and cloning, especially with Gibson assembly.
Filip Mollerup (Aalto University) gave input on ideas for scaling up enzyme production when we were developing our project idea, and later on in the project suggested ways to improve enzyme purification.
Salla Virtanen (Aalto University) showed how to use the microplate reader and gave advice on setting up our microplate reader fluorescence assay.
Martina Ikonen (Aalto University) also advised us on the setting up the microplate reader assay and  helped to develop and improve it.
Ekaterina Osmekhina (Aalto University) gave additional advice on parameters for the microplate reader, and informative ways to plot fluorescence measurement data.
Bart Rooijakkers (Aalto University) advised us on the choice of linkers and plasmids to use.
Sesilja Aranko (Aalto University) gave some general advice about designing and ordering DNA constructs.
Christopher Jonkergouw (Aalto University) helped us with sequencing.
The Aalto-Helsinki 2014 and 2015 teams gave us advice on how to start the project planning, how to acquire funding and on iGEM in general. Their help was really important, and we were able to turn to them when in doubt.
Our heartfelt thanks go to the aforementioned people and everyone else who supported us throughout our project. Whether you helped shape our project by sharing your thoughts with us, assisted with the everyday practicalities of our project, or gave moral support - we are immensely grateful to you all!

There had been lots of challenges during the project, but for me, getting to tackle those challenges has been the best part of iGEM by far. This experience has made me certain that in the future, I definitely want to keep pushing myself and not settle for the easiest route if there’s another option that allows me to keep learning new, interesting things!
Snehadri Sinha

I have been doing research and working in the lab, producing the degradation enzyme - it has been a summer of making growth media and gels and much more. Other than that, I worked on our presentations and the project video.
I heard about iGEM at a time when I was looking for innovative research projects. Moreover, the opportunity to work in a trendy field like synthetic biology and that too in a student-led team seemed too good to miss so I went ahead and applied! Easily the best decision I have taken this year.
During the long hours spent in the lab I have learnt much about time management and planning. I am more confident in my practical skills now and I acquired a newfound enthusiasm for facing challenges. The meetups during the summer have shown me first-hand the importance of networking and collaborations.
Jami Valorinta
Mathematics at the University of Helsinki
In the team I’ve mostly been doing everything related to computers. In the beginning of the summer, I updated our website at aaltohelsinki.com. Then a lot of time went into the server-side programming of the CollabSeeker. After that, I was responsible for coding WikiFire+ for the wiki team, while also helping out with the front-end development. As a math major, I was also pretty deeply involved with the modelling and computer simulations. And I was even let into the lab a few times! It was nice to try my hand at plating and other common lab procedures.
Spring 2016. I saw a poster in the hallway of Kumpula, the natural sciences campus of the University of Helsinki. It was advertising a synthetic biology competition I had never heard about. At the time I didn’t have a very clear idea what synthetic biology even was, but the poster was calling for mathematicians with programming experience, and I was looking for something challenging to do during the summer, so I decided to apply to this “iGEM”.
During the summer, I’ve solidified my programming skills, learned the process of mathematical modelling from the ground up, tried my hand at lab work, and gotten a little taste of real research work. That’s not to even mention the indoor surfing, wall climbing, room escaping and other fun stuff we did during the summer. This has definitely been a formative experience.

Other people
We would like to start with thanking Markus Linder, the primary PI of our project. He has been there for us right from the start, introducing us to the ways of iGEM and guiding us through the brainstorming and initial research stages. He helped us get in touch with experts and also arranged for some of our funding. We held weekly meetings with him almost during the whole project and got valuable advice on many matters. During different stages of the project we had several ideas on which direction to proceed in - he helped us recognize the more important things to focus on. He has also encouraged independent thinking amongst ourselves to maintain the student-driven aspect of the project. Lately, he has helped us a lot in preparing for the Giant Jamboree. His support has been invaluable in our iGEM journey.
Heli Viskari was our instructor and also there for us from the beginning. She answered all questions related to the lab and also arranged the lab space for us - so important for carrying out for our experiments! She helped with the FACS instrument and setup. She also regularly gave her input on our results and the progress of our project.
Merja Penttilä (VTT) encouraged us to think outside the box in our brainstorming sessions. As the secondary PI of our project, she gave us advice and direction when designing our project idea.
We had the opportunity to talk to Kaarina Sivonen and her cyanobacteria research group at the University of Helsinki. They really helped us by answering our questions, providing us with the cyanobacteria we used in our experiments and by analysing our enzyme activity samples. We were in contact especially with David Fewer, who is a researcher at the group. He helped us in planning the project and provided useful research articles. With his input we were able to design and carry out various laboratory experiments. Also, the group’s laboratory technician, Matti Wahlsten, helped us tremendously and we are very grateful to him for analysing all of our enzyme activity samples (there was a lot of them). He also gave us the safety training concerning working with the toxins and the cyanobacteria and how to handle and dispose of them. Without Matti’s help, we would have had to come up with some different way of analysing the enzyme activity in our samples, which most likely would have given us less time to spend on doing other things in the lab. As a gesture of thanks we decided to name the main character in our introduction video as Matti.
Jussi Jäntti (VTT) attended many of our brainstorming sessions and advised us, especially on the use yeast as a chassis. He also gave advice on designing transporters and the choice of fluorescent protein for the detection.
Alexander Frey (Aalto University) helped solve many of our problems related to yeast. He advised on signal sequences for our construct design. He also helped us with the choice of yeast strain and provided us with protocols for some of the yeast lab work.
Jorg de Ruijter (Aalto University, formerly) helped us tremendously with various everyday problems, especially with yeast-related work. He gave us yeast protocols and answered our questions about them, and advised on things to take into account in designing several of our yeast experiments. He also gave advice on yeast strains, plasmids, and designing the genome integration of the transporters.
Pezhman Mohammadi (Aalto University) was the go-to person whenever we faced problems with protein work, be it in the practical work or designing the experiment. He gave us useful advice on protein purification and helped choose parameters for FPLC. He advised us on homology modeling, codon optimization for the enzyme production, and also helped order the enzyme constructs.
Georg Schmidt (Aalto University) has answered our questions relating to DNA constructs design, and was the go-to person for any questions on cloning. He also helped us with PCR troubleshooting and advised on things to take into account with our microplate reader assay.
Dominik Mojzita (VTT) gave us advice related to stress reactions and yeast strain choices. He provided valuable input on yeast stress response, choice of linkers, enzyme activity controls, and also suggested the use of FACS.
Mari Piirainen (Aalto University) helped us with practical problems related to yeast, and also taught us how to use FACS.
Anssi Rantasalo (VTT) helped us with designing our transporter constructs and gave general advice on FACS and analyzing the results.
Anssi Rantasalo (VTT) helped us with designing our transporter constructs and gave general advice on FACS and analyzing the results.
Merja Oja (VTT) introduced us to the field of modelling and helped give direction to our modellers.
Ion Petre (Åbo Akademi) oriented us further into modelling and provided us with helpful example programs and models for our project.
Sami Havukainen (Aalto University) gave valuable advice us on choice of yeast strain and cloning, especially with Gibson assembly.
Filip Mollerup (Aalto University) gave input on ideas for scaling up enzyme production when we were developing our project idea, and later on in the project suggested ways to improve enzyme purification.
Salla Virtanen (Aalto University) showed how to use the microplate reader and gave advice on setting up our microplate reader fluorescence assay.
Martina Ikonen (Aalto University) also advised us on the setting up the microplate reader assay and  helped to develop and improve it.

Synthetic biologists are the next rockstars! Not just me who’s saying that, according to wired.com : ""biologists are the next rock star designers""
Theater or cinema?
Cinema, because it’s for young people. I will engineer my own genes to stay forever young.
What did you work on during the project?
I worked very hard in the lab during the summer, designing and executing the CRISPR strategy for the insertion of the URA3 gene. I helped plan and host a lecture during our BioBrick tutorial, and helped supervising the high-school students in the lab.
Stefani Pjaca
MSc. Biotechnology, 3rd semester.
What is your motivation for joining the iGEM team?
iGEM is an once-in-a-lifetime learning opportunity to be a part of an ambitious team and to develop a project from scratch to the final jamboree in Boston and hopefully contribute to the synthetic biology community.
If you had 50.000 DKK to spend in two hours, what would you spend them on?
I really enjoy traveling the world, so I would definitely use the money to go traveling somewhere! I would probably book a trip to Australia since I have never been there before.
What did you work on during the project?
I was involved in planning and executing our BioBrick tutorial, and was in contact with Novozymes. I worked during the summer in the lab on knocking out PEX10 using the CRISPR-Cas9 system in Y. lipolytica
Mohamad Ali Khalil El Lakany
MSc. Bioinformatics and Systems Biology, 2nd semester.
What is your motivation for joining the iGEM team?
I like the entrepreneurial aspect to the whole project. Having and idea and making that idea happen. To watch it expand into something useful, beautiful, practical and lastly, presentable. To handle and overcome the obstacles you meet on that road. Yes, it really thrills me. iGEM is exactly that and more.
What cheers you up?
Oh, that’s a long list. I would mention, children and dogs. Children because of their innate, almost unquenchable curiosity, in addition to their appreciation for the even the smallest things. They make us rethink- and re-evaluate our habituated views on things and actions. Dogs are very loyal and excited to see you - specially the dogs serving in law-enforcement. They chase you down as if they are huge fans and I, Justin Bieber - yes, they have us confused a lot
What did you work on during the project?
I helped the team by spending the majority of my time in the lab, planning, troubleshooting and excecuting the substrate screening experiments. I networked and facilitated contact with key university faculty and members of industry, condusive for the aim of our project. I applied- and procured samples of waste- and byproducts from several industrial processes in addition to acquiring sponsorships for branded clothing, bags and accessories for our team.

If you can’t have fun with what you are going to work with the rest of your life - what’s the point of it all?
What would you rather? Always dance instead of walking, or always sing instead of talking.
I would die from pure happiness if my life was a musical, and every conversation was just a build-up to a song about my life! Alas, people who have ever run into me on a long day in the lab will know, that I have an awful singing voice.
What did you work on during the project?
I helped fundraising and securing financial back-up for the project. I was involved in the contact with suppliers in retrieving sponsership deals. In the lab I worked the entire summer on designing and executing the strategy for CRISPR-Cas9 implemented knock-out of PEX10 in Y. lipolytica. I also assisted Kristoffer in laboratory work on the assembly of pSB1A8YL, and helped clone our BioBricks.
Baosheng James Hou

How do you want your remains dealt with when you die?
Forget about burial or burning. I want to have my name (or possibly nickname) engraved in the forehead of my skull, and then have it preserved in a glass case. That way I will still be among my descendants, so they always can consult me.
What did you work on during the project?
I programmed the microfermentation platform, helped with exploring codon optimization theory. I helped the other members establish a mathematical understanding and interpretation of genome-scale modeling and phenotype phase planes. I wrote the code for extending the genome-scale model of Y. lipolytica with the beta-carotene pathway.
Line Andresen
BSc. Biotechnology. 5th semester.
What is your motivation for joining the iGEM team?
Synthetic biology is the coolest! I talked to one of last years team members, and I knew I had to be a part of this years iGEM team. I want to use biology to solve some of the problems we are facing and will face in the future.
Would you rather fight one horse-sized duck, or a hundred duck-sized horses?
I would definitely choose a hundred duck-sized horses. Ducks can be aggressive and I wouldn’t want to meet one that is bigger than I am! On the other side, if I could tame the duck, then I would have a pet that might be big enough to fly with me on its back? In that case I would choose the duck!
What did you work on during the project?
I was a big part of the Interlab project, and did most of the cloning required. I provided feedback for the design for the wiki, and was involved with testing and developing of the biosensor project. I was the teams travel agent, and booked tickets for our trips to Stockholm, Paris and most importantly Boston.
Kristoffer Bach Falkenberg
MSc. Biotechnology. 3rd semester.
What is your motivation for joining the iGEM team?
I’m deeply fascinated with synthetic biology, and the problems the technology can solve today and will be able to solve in the future. The fact that we have come to a point in time where programming life is a relatively trivial task is fantastic, and I want to be a part of the development of this field. Also I like the smell of yeast!
What art would you like to master?
The art of watching Titanic without falling asleep. People tell me it’s a classic and I need to watch it to the end, although I’ve had three attempts so far but have fallen asleep every time (Leo could definitely have fitted on the door by the way).
What did you work on during the project?
Besides being the student leader and a part the administrative group, I designed, cloned and tested our pSB1A8YL plasmid. Furthermore, I did a fair amount of cloning and characterization of the hrGFP and proinsulin constructs, and helped supervise the high schoolers in the lab.

""Coming together is a beginning. Keeping together is progress. Working together is success.""
Henry Ford
Being part of an iGEM team is a lot of fun, because you get to be part of a worldwide community, and you get to spend your summer with a group of likeminded people all working towards the same goal. The DTU BioBuilders is a team gathered from different faculties across year groups and nationalities. So to get to know each other and promote the team spirit, we arranged a handful of different social activities outside the office and the lab.
Having Fun with the Group
The whole team gathered one afternoon for a game of the Danish version of softball called ""Rundbold.""

Gijs Verkleij
MSc. in Biotechnology, 2nd semester.
What is your motivation for joining the iGEM team?
Synthetic biologists are the next rockstars! Not just me who’s saying that: wired.com: ""biologists are the next rock star designers""
Theater or cinema?
Cinema, because it’s for young people. I will engineer my own genes to stay forever young.
Stefani Pjaca
MSc. in Biotechnology, 2nd semester.
What is your motivation for joining the iGEM team?
iGEM is an once-in-a-lifetime learning opportunity to be a part of an ambitious team and to develop a project from scratch to the final jamboree in Boston and hopefully contribute to the synthetic biology community.
If you had 50.000 DKK to spend in two hours, what would you spend them on?
I really enjoy traveling the world, so I would definitely use the money to go traveling somewhere! I would probably book a trip to Australia since I have never been there before.
Mohamad Ali Khalil El Lakany
MSc. Bioinformatics and Systems Biology, 1st semester.
What is your motivation for joining the iGEM team?
I like the entrepreneurial aspect to the whole project. Having and idea and making that idea happen. To watch it grow to something useful, beautiful, practical and presentable. To handle and overcome the obstacles you meet on that road. It really thrills me. Igem is exactly that and more.
What cheers you up?
Oh, that’s a long list. I would say, children and dogs. Children because of their innate, almost unquenchable curiosity, in addition to their appreciation for the even the smallest things. They make us rethink things and reevaluate our habituated views on things and the actions we do. Dogs are just great, and always happy to see  you...loyal too.
Isabella Loft
MSc. Bioinformatics and Systems Biology, 1st semester.
What is your motivation for joining the iGEM team?
Utilising my skills in concert with other smart people to create something that may some day change or better the life of even a few are always a great way to learn even more.
Which destination would you love to recommend other people visiting?
Marrakech in Morocco is one of my favorite destinations, the food culture is rich with a wealth of spices. Taking a walk in the old city gives both joy for the eyes that can’t rest on a single thing and a quest to not get stuck under a scooter or other vehicle before you can find your way out of the labyrinthine like small streets when you have become lost.
Mikkel Storm
BSc. Biotechnology. 4th semester.
What is your motivation for joining the iGEM team?
I want to further my horizon with a special course in synthetic biology. It is a great motivation to participate in a competition and i look forward meeting other participants and see their projects.
Dogs or cats? Why?
I like dogs, my small puppets to take over the world.
Klaudia Ciurkot
MSc. in Biotechnology, 1st semester
What is your motivation for joining the iGEM team?
The list of reasons is quite long, in fact I cannot find a reason to not join! iGEM is the great opportunity to work on a scientific project with a group of amazing people, dedicated to science while having fun as well.
S. cerevisiae or E. coli - why?
Saccharomyces cerevisiae since I love a freshly baked yeast cake with plums, yummy!
Trine Sofie Bladt
MSc. in Biotechnology. 2nd semester.
What is your motivation for joining the iGEM team?
If you can’t have fun with what you are going to work with the rest of your life - what’s the point of it all?
What would you rather? Always dance instead of walking, or always sing instead of talking.
I would die from pure happiness if my life was a musical, and every conversation was just a build-up to a song about my life! Alas, people who have ever run into me on a long day in the lab will know, that I have an awful singing voice.
Baosheng James Hou
MSc. Biomedical Engineering. 2nd semester.
What is your motivation for joining the iGEM team?
Over a lifetime there are only so many moments where you can join a force of good and become a part of something greater than ourselves. There is a divine message in the code of life - Mankind will be united, we will see past our differences, diseases shall be cured, species shall be saved, Mother Nature shall be defended. In the name of synthetic biology shall we march bravely down not the easiest path, but one that’s true.
Which historical figure would you prefer to be haunted by?
My past self. So I can be constantly reminded of my mistakes, as well as the times I’ve bathed in glory.
Mathias Blicher Bjerregård
MSc. Mathematical Modelling. 8th semester.
What is your motivation for joining the iGEM team?
Improve my experience on applied data analysis and modeling
How do you want your remains dealt with when you die?
Forget about burial or burning. I want to have my name (or possibly nickname) engraved in the forehead of my skull, and then have it preserved in a glass case. That way I will still be among my descendants, so they always can consult me.
Line Andresen
BSc. Biotechnology. 4th semester.
What is your motivation for joining the iGEM team?
Synthetic biology is the coolest! I talked to one of last years team members, and I knew I had to be a part of this years iGEM team. I want to use biology to solve some of the problems we are facing and will face in the future.
Would you rather fight one horse-sized duck, or a hundred duck-sized horses?
I would definitely choose a hundred duck-sized horses. Ducks can be aggressive and I wouldn’t want to meet one that is bigger than I am! On the other side, if I could tame the duck, then I would have a pet that might be big enough to fly with me on its back? In that case I would choose the duck!
Kristoffer Bach Falkenberg
MSc. in Biotechnology. 2nd semester.
What is your motivation for joining the iGEM team?
I’m deeply fascinated with synthetic biology, and the problems the technology can solve today and will be able to solve in the future. The fact that we have come to a point in time where programming life is a relatively trivial task is fantastic, and I want to be a part of the development of this field. Also I like the smell of yeast!
What art would you like to master?
The art of watching Titanic without falling asleep. People tell me it’s a classic and I need to watch it to the end, although I’ve had three attempts so far but have fallen asleep every time (Leo could definitely have fitted on the door by the way).
Vasileios Rantos
M.Sc in Bioinformatics and Systems Biology. 2nd semester.
What is your motivation for joining the iGEM team?
A preview of future biological applications is an offer that I can not refuse, this is how I see iGEM. So, having the opportunity to be part of a proof-of-concept procedure will help to achieve my long-term goals for a major contribution in the Biological discipline and the solutions it can provide in our everyday lives.
If you had a warning label, what would yours say?
BEWARE: High concentration of humour Description: Usage recommended for people with bad mood. Extremely addictive, use under your own risk.
Benjamin Schwetz
M.Sc. Biotechnology. 2nd semester.
What is your motivation for joining the iGEM team?
To promote and develop concepts of open technology within synthetic biology and to win a gold medal, of course.
What music do you listen to when cleaning?
I usually crawl out of my bed to The worst hangover ever by The Offspring, make some coffee, and then I put on Curtis Mayfield (Curtis) to get it done.
Camilla Krogsgaard
Msc. in Biotechnology. 2nd semester.
What is your motivation for joining the iGEM team?
iGEM is awesome and such a great learning opportunity - and hey, who wouldn’t want to go on a trip to Boston?!
What would you want to be in your next life?
A microorganism that can produce an enzyme which prevents people from getting fat when eating chocolate. Wow, I’d be precious!
Sidsel Ettrup Clemmensen
MSc. in Biotechnology.  2nd semester.
What is your motivation for joining the iGEM team?
To save the planet and mankind! Or at least to become a part of the synthetic biology community and help develop technologies to solve some of the problems that our and the generations to come are facing.
If you joined a circus, what would you perform?
I actually did perform in a circus as a juggler - which definitely shines through in my laboratory skills!
Nicolai Kofod-Jensen
BSc. Environmental engineering. 2nd semester.
What is your motivation for joining the iGEM team?
It is my dream to combine Biotechnological and Environmental Engineering disciplines to combat pollution in water and soil, potentially using synthetic biology to create cells capable of biodegradation of persistent organic pollutants (POPs). As such, this feels like a logical start.
How would you prank someone on April fool's day?
I'm not quite sure... Not so much into pranking. I suppose that's why I never see it coming when people try to prank me..."

Undergraduates
All of the undergraduates executed all of the experiments. Each individual partook in creating the three plasmids necessary for the successful incorporation of the non-canonical amino acid. For the initial experiment, everyone helped demonstrate the localization of eGFP within the EutS compartments in various expression levels through molecular cloning. This was done in order to help improve the success rate of EutS compartmentalization. After this was proven, subteams were formed.
Jonah, Brandon, Maxwell, and Jessica:
Their primary tasks were to create the desired tri-plasmid system; this included the EutS shell protein, EutC tagged with eGFP, and the pEVOL plasmid.
Elizabeth and Will:
In order to successfully incorporate the non-canonical amino acid into this tri-plasmid system, genomic edits on the EutS genome must be made. Positions for mutagenesis was done in various spots on the genome in order to test whether or not the incorporation facilitated with the formation of the shell protein.Their primary tasks were to create a library of mutants with MUSE using CRISPR-Cas9. By making genomic edits, the native EutS shell protein was activated; also, variants created by these edits were used to test against the native EUTS compartment.
Michael Donovan:
Used PyRosetta position scoring to find possible binding sites of assembled hexamers. Looked at locations at the edge of EutS hexamer when aligned to E.coli EutM.
Co-Advisers
Brian DeDecker & Robin Dowell:
Handled the finances and written documents for the iGem team at CU Boulder.
Mentors
Michael Brasino:
Oversaw the project on a week-to-week basis, provided insight on how to approach mishaps and guided us in the right direction for the experiments. He also helped create the azobenzene.
Marcelo Bassalo:
Helped design the genomic Eut operon constructs to test the native system and generate the library variants. He provided the muse CREATE system using CRISPR-Cas9 to conduct the experiments.

The Northeastern iGEM Team is grateful to the following people and organizations who have supported and assisted us with our research project throughout the course of this summer.
Professor Carolyn Lee-Parsons
Carolyn W.T. Lee-Parsons is an Associate Professor at Northeastern University, jointly appointed between the departments of Chemical Engineering and Chemistry / Chemical Biology. Her research interests involve engineering the metabolism and regulation of natural products from cultures of medicinal plants and biofuels from microalgae to improve the supply of critical pharmaceutical compounds and the productivity of biofuels.
Professor Veronica Godoy-Carter
Veronica Godoy-Carter is an Associate Professor at Northeastern University. Her research group is interested in studying a multiple protein complex formed by components involved in important DNA transactions when cells are exposed to DNA damage. This is a condition that induces the expression of error-prone DNA polymerases, the activity of which might lead to mutations. Their long-term goal is to learn about the mechanisms that regulate the activity of error-prone Y family DNA polymerases. They use bacteria as a model system and especially Escherichia coli. Due to its relative simplicity, studying basic processes in bacteria will render mechanistic insights that would be difficult to attain directly in more complex systems.
Integrated DNA Technologies (IDT)
The Northeastern iGEM Team would like to thank IDT for the free synthesis of 20kB of gBlocks® Gene Fragments. Without this generous gift much of our work would not have been possible.
Aaron Moskoff at Northeastern 3D Print Studio
Thank you to Aaron Moskoff for laser cutting parts used in our MEC and for providing technical advice for the building of our MEC chamber.
Northeastern University Department of Biology
Thank you to the Northeastern Department of Biology, in particular Adrian Gilbert, Frauke Argyros, and Corissa Mantooth for helping to provide a lab space to work in and materials to work with. This project couldn’t have moved forward without the patience and effort that was put in to make this happen.

Riza Unabia
4th Year
Riza is a fourth year Biomedical Sciences student at Ryerson University. She was part of the winning team of Ryerson’s annual Chemistry and Biology (CaB) Challenge, which gave them the opportunity to join the iGem competition. She was motivated to win upon learning that iGem focuses on the expansion and innovation of synthetic biology. She always found synthetic biology fascinating with the various creations of parts that can be assembled together to create novel and efficient systems applicable to various sectors (medicine, energy, etc.).
     She is a Policies and Practices member of the Ryerson team focusing on public outreach and engagement, as well as a member of the Wiki page development. She is ecstatic to work alongside driven peers and will always keep an open and inquisitive mind to learn more from others. In her spare time, she loves to hike, explore nature, and go on road trips. She’s a major lover of ice cream and would like to try all the flavours in the world. Aside from a successful healthcare career, her other ultimate goals are to visit at least 10 countries in her lifetime as well as go on a week-long roadtrip.
Nathan Battersby
4th Year
Nathan is a fourth year Biology student at Ryerson University. He is the Policies and Practices lead of Ryerson’s iGem team. He is interested in research and would like to start with synthetic biology. Given that, he would like to develop his understanding around the potentials of the subject and how it can change the game for production and resource extraction. He believes that most of the world’s problems can be solved using synthetic biology and that humanity just needs to apply the existing tools.
     He is highly interested in science communication and would like to see the Toronto community become more scientifically literate about synthetic biology. He has worked on a previous 2015 cyanobacteria grant application, which has also formed the basis for the current iGem project. In his own personal time, Nathan loves to watch and play hockey while also thinking of ways to make biological wings for humans as his next cool science development.
Tanya Aziz
4th Year
Tanya is currently completing her fourth year Biomedical Science program at Ryerson University. She was a member of the winning CaB challenge team in Ryerson and wants to try her hand in research through iGem. She is interested in the fact that organisms that aren’t visible to the human eye are able to produce useful commercial products. She hopes to gain valuable research experience and improve her presentation skills by participating in the iGem jamboree.
     She is a member of the Policies and Practices team and the lead for the team’s public outreach and workshops. Her creativity is valued in organizing interactive activities in order to increase public awareness regarding synthetic biology. Her creativity also interests her in creating a fashion-fornward and stylish vegan clothing from waste products. Tanya is a self-proclaimed treehugger and would love to use synthetic biology to do something good for the environment. In her spare time, she loves to watch tearjerker movies while eating pickles with Nutella.
Donnie Stangroom
4th Year
Donald Stangroom is a chemistry major at Ryerson University. His hobbies include reading, skateboarding and an amateur chemistry YouTube channel. Donald was motivated to join the igem team because an opportunity to work with synthetic biology, which has so many potential applications, seemed like a good one. His previous research experience includes working in an organic synthesis lab and helping to create a synthetic biology proposal for Ontario Genomics. He would eventually like Science to to fully understand the mechanism behind driver-less cars to hep cut down on accidents. He is highly interests in synthetic biology and its many applications from manufacturing to energy, all while maintaining “green” products. In the end, he hopes to gain experience using synthetic biology to synthesize novel and interesting organic molecules from this project.
Reeda Mahmood
4th Year
Reeda is in her fourth year completing her Biomedical Sciences program at Ryerson University. She learned of the iGem competition last summer and thought it was an awesome opportunity to incorporate to the existing CaB challenge in Ryerson. Synthetic biology is an exciting field and she hopes for Ryerson Science undergraduates to play a part in its growth. By participating she hopes to learn more about research and gain a better understanding of the wonders of directing genetic machinery in a bacterial cell.
     Reeda is Ryerson’s iGem team lead and a member of the wet lab team. She has a great interest in science outreach highlighted through previous events she has helped organized. One of which aimed to break the record for the longest DNA model in the world, which was a success! She likes to learn calligraphy on her spare time and would like someone to invent a teleportation machine that can help her commute to school.
Aesha Patel
4th Year
Aesha is a fourth year Biology Student at Ryerson University. She is highly interested in synthetic biology for its infinite applications and the way it can be used as solutions to a wide range of problems. For her, synthetic biology is essentially a lego factory for scientists. If you can dream it, it can (most likely) be engineered. She hopes to get Ryerson’s name into the scientific community and raise the interest for the field of synthetic biology. This way, the public can gain a better appreciation for this emerging field.
     Aesha is the team’s all-rounder from managing lab work, organizing outreach activities and developing the Wiki page. It gets pretty hectic but it is a way for her to learn a bit of everything. Her skills are a result of her previous volunteering experiences at a Botany and Molecular Biology Lab at Ryerson and her current co-op term at the Princess Margaret Cancer Research Tower. In the future, she hopes to establish a way to grow all plants in harsh conditions (maybe even Mars?) to address the problem on world hunger. She loves reading, biking, and (now) watching Star Trek. She is also a fan of FRIENDS, so ask her a trivia and she got the answer.

Sharing and  collaboration are core values of iGEM, and our team also devote ourselves to  expanding the influence of synthetic biology with others. In this part, we have been help Guangdong Experimental High  School’ students to build a team (GDGDSYZX-United ) to participate in the iGEM  competition.
1.We helped them distribute of tasks to  everyone  according to their intention and talent,  such as experimenters, art designers,  editors and speakers.
2.We introduced  the purpose and overview of iGEM competition and explained  the rules to the them in detail.  Also, we showed some excellent wiki to let them know how to start their work and how to achieve their goal.
3.We showed  them how to use equipment to do experiment.  Since their chassis is plant cell, which is similar with us, so we could give  some guidance to their project. We also provide some plasmids  to them.
We lead them to  design their own logo and  team uniform. And we also send two teammates  (Wang Rong and Lin Yunping) to Guangdong Experimental High School for several months to be their art and modeling advisor to help them build web page and design poster .
We hold a meeting to communicate about project progress and team construction,  sharing experience and learn from each other.
Since the iGEMers  from team GDSYZX-United are all high school students, most of them know little  about mathematical tool which can help optimize biological experiments.So we  talk to them and try to make them to comprehen the usage of mathematical tool  in biological experiments by giving some examples of mathematical modeling in  iGEM projects. What’s more, we give them some advice when they are analyzing  the experiment results."

OUR TEAM
Welcome to our little family
Our team is divided into three parts: dry lab, wet lab and communication. We are a multidisciplinary group from two universities that are willing to do its best to produce an amazing project. Do you want to meet us?
DRY LAB
Alejandro Cuetos
Hi, I'm Alejandro Cuetos, lecturer on Chemical  Physics Area. I am not sure why I am working  with Bacteria, but I am finding  it very funny. I am the supervisor of the modeling part  of the project, where we are learning very interesting things  about how to predict the biofilm behavior.
Francisco Javier Lobo
Hi, there!!  I'm Francisco Javier Lobo, one of the members of the dry lab. I love Microbiology and Programming, so when they asked me to join I jumped in with both feet (and  a computer). I think  the iGEM competition is an opportunity to interact with people from all over the world. See you all!
Norberto Díaz
I'm Norberto Díaz, Dean of the School of Engenieering at Pablo de Olavide University. I'm member of this excelent group as a tutor of dry lab - communication.
Israel León
Hi! I am Israel  León, a student of the Information Systems  Engineer Degree in University Pablo de Olavide. I don’t quite understand what biotechnlogy is, but I love this project and its complexity. I hope you find it as funny as I do!
WET LAB
José Martín
Hello everyone! I'm José, a recent biotech graduate, and I'm really amazed by the potential of synthetic biology. I'm a member of the wetlab group  and responsible for the propionate module. Let's make iGEM 2016 an unforgettable experience together!
Laura Claret
Hi! I'm Laura Claret, a graduate student of the Biotechnology Degree in our University. I'd never thought I would be selected for such a cool thing as iGEM, but here I am, in charge  of half the workload of the Micro Wet Lab. Hope you find our project as bewildering as I do!
Álvaro Escobar
Hi iGEMers and current people!  I'm Alvaro and I'm a biotechnologist. I think  I'm a funny and peaceful  guy, and I love making jokes. I can not yet believe that  I was chosen  to have the opportunity of being part  of the iGEM contest. I'm excited for being in touch with teams of the whole world, and I’m looking forward to explaining our fantastic project to everyone. See you at Boston!
Rafa R. Daga
Rafael R. Daga was born  in Malaga (Spain). He studied Biology in the Faculty of Science, University of Malaga and graduated on 1991. He received  his Ph.D. in 1999 in Genetics in the same University. He did his postdoctoral works in the CSIC/University of Salamanca (Spain), Columbia University and Rockefeller University (New York, EEUU). In 2006 he joined  the University Pablo de Olavide in Seville (Spain) where,  since 2009, he is full professor. Since 2008 he has his own laboratory in the Andalusian Centre  for Developmental Biology (CABD) in Seville. In 2010 he participated as instructor in iGEM with the UPO-Sevilla  team  and presented the project entitled Bacterial Crowding.
Gabriel Ruiz
Hi! I am Gabriel Ruiz. I am a 21 years old student of Biotechnology at Pablo de Olavide University. When our teacher told us about  making an iGEM team,  I would have never thought I would be selected to be part  of it! I’m so grateful and excited, as synthetic biology is one of my two passions, apart from cinema. I would love to direct  a movie about  iGEM!
Fernando Govantes
And this would be me… Over the years evolved to be called Fernan and then  Fer... I may end up losing my name  altogether. I am the grandfather of the team  and I run the Biofilms subteam. Best known  for my secular knowledge on bacterial strain genotypes, transposons and other  genetic  gimmicks, and for being the keeper of legendary protocols and media  recipes.
COMMUNICATION
Maite González
My name  is Maite but everyone calls me May. I am studying Journalism at the Sevilla university since 2013. I just finished my third year of my career  and I am very passionate about  it. My hobbies are the photografy and audiovisual creations like short-films and spot. I really love the literature, the videogames and the Science fiction too. I am interested in the popularizing of science so I think  it is something very important in the last years to communicate new scientific  advances. I consider myself a creative, fun and very sociable person so I am always delighted to participate in new projects. Nice to meet you."

Advisors
Kateryna Ievdokymenko
2nd Year PhD Microbiology
This is my second year returning to advise the UBC iGEM team, and I am very exited to participate again. I'm particularly interested in two fields in science right now - environmental genomics and synthetic biology. Also, I love traveling and my vacation destinations are usually determined by wind or surf seasons.
Raphael Roccor
3rd Year PhD Microbiology
I did my Masters in Biochemistry in Germany before coming to Vancouver for my PhD. I also studied and worked in Australia and Brazil for a total of 13 months and gained experience in molecular parasitology. Now, I'm very interested in engineering bacteria for the valorization of biomass and am working on commercializing a microbial technology to produce high-value lipids from agriculture and forestry residues.
Joe Ho
Msc Microbiology
All great things are built in a team. I had the privilege to be part of this iGEM experience since an undergraduate. For the second time this year, I took on an advising role on the team, helping out with Policy and Practices and the wet lab work.
Elesha Hoffarth
3rd Year PhD Chemistry
I completed my undergraduate degree in Biochemistry at the University of Calgary, and moved to Vancouver in 2014 to start my PhD. My research focuses on natural product biosynthesis of antibiotics and mechanisms of biosynthetic enzymes during catalysis. In my free time, I enjoy exploring Vancouver, watching Netflix, and playing music. My biggest lab blunder is that I forgot to check that the tap was closed while I was filling a distilled water container. 10 minutes later, I came back to an empty container and 15 L of water on the floor.
Meghan Verstraete
5th Year PhD Microbiology
I like microbiology and synthetic biology, so I have found helping out as an iGEM graduate advisor to be really fun! Outside of science, I like to ski and do ballet. I also like cats (meow!).
James Round
5th Year PhD Microbiology
I'm a veteran of the UBC iGEM team, having been a member for as long as I can remember. I am an avid outdoors person, and live in the most beautiful place in the world that allows me to get out and explore.
Team
Tamar Av-Shalom
3rd Year Combined Major in Microbiology/Immunology and Computer Science
I'm keen on combining computer science with biology and bridging the gap between wet lab work and dry lab. In my spare time, I am an avid baker and pinterest enthusiast,       if all my education endeavors fail, I will end up running a gluten free bakery.
David Goertsen
4th year Chemical and Biological Engineering
I have always enjoyed the opportunity for problem solving available in chemical and biological engineering, and the field of synthetic biology has presented a great deal of opportunity to create new solutions for conventional problems. I am excited to be a part of such a rapidly developing field and am excited to see what opportunities await. I really enjoy playing electric guitar. Learning guitar solos from classic songs is something that I have spent a lot of time on since High School The bands whose songs I most like to play are Pink Floyd, Led Zeppelin, and Radiohead.
Jewel Ocampo
4th Year Honors Microbiology and Immunology
I'm infamous for wrong lyrics. My greatest lab blunder is that I contaminated a batch of competent cells, realizing this only after the painful process of troubleshooting why my cells were showing resistance to antibiotics they were supposed to be susceptible to (two weeks of work down the drain).
Anson Yam
3rd year Chemical Engineering
I work really slowly. Currently learning html, css, and javascript to make the wiki. Definitely not addicted to coffee, or the internet. Working out, but somehow making no gains.
Darren Christy
4th Year Honors Biochemistry
Typical Canadian guy...would rather be in the lab 4 degree room than outside in 30 degree sun-shine. I have 2 seasons - Hockey season and the short period of time between July and August for mountain biking. In my off time I'm billionaire Bruce Wayne.
Azadvir Bal
3rd Year Chemistry
I am good at hiding things in my beard. I spend more hours each week washing my car than I do showering myself.
Bahar Moussavi
2nd Year Combined Major in Microbiology/Immunology and Computer Science
I am passionate about research. I am mostly interested in stem cell research and cancer cell research. I love to read and draw! My biggest lab blunder is that I once       stabbed myself with a needle contaminated by E-coli. I couldn't sleep for days thinking I would suddenly show signs of a disease and die in the name of science!!
Connor Ulvestad
4th year Biology
Edmonton born and raised!!!!
Vaastav Anand
3rd Year Computer Science Honors
Soccer fanatic (It's football!) and loves the rain! My biggest lab blunder is that in High School Biology, I could not obtain cheek cells for my Biology final practical...

WE ARE BACK！！！ This time, 13 students with different specialities join in the team LN-Shiyan-China to achieve the same goal----- eliminating the pesticides residues in crops. Under the help of our 3 teachers, we successfully improve the result in the field of biology and know better about the concept of teamwork. We will be fearless to explore to make sure the results won’t be reckless. We believe in what we believe will make the world a better place, just by changing from the most fundamental thing in our lives--- the food we eat.

This page is used by the judges to evaluate your team for the Attributions bronze criterion .
Delete this box in order to be evaluated for this medal. See more information at Instructions for Pages for awards .
Each team must clearly attribute work done by the student team members on this page. The team must distinguish work done by the students from work done by others, including the host labs, advisors, instructors, and individuals not on the team roster.
Why is this page needed?
The Attribution requirement helps the judges know what you did yourselves and what you had help with. We don't mind if you get help with difficult or complex techniques, but you must report what work your team did and what work was done by others.
For example, you might choose to work with an animal model during your project. Working with animals requires getting a license and applying far in advance to conduct certain experiments in many countries. This is difficult to achieve during the course of a summer, but much easier if you can work with a postdoc or PI who has the right licenses.
What should this page have?
General Support
Project support and advice
Fundraising help and advice
Lab support
Difficult technique support
Project advisor support
Wiki support
Presentation coaching
Human Practices support
Thanks and acknowledgements for all other people involved in helping make a successful iGEM team
Can we base our project on a previous one?
Yes! You can have a project based on a previous team, or based on someone else's idea, as long as you state this fact very clearly and give credit for the original project.

Two PIs
Dr. Keli Tian
Being the first PI, I spent this whole summer vacation with these high school students who are interested deeply in Synthetic Biology and iGEM. I enjoyed meeting and working alongside so many driven young individuals, who worked tirelessly to bring their ideas to life. I’m so proud of these young girls and boys. I am a quiet person, but I love to stay with these young people, because they can influence me with their energy and vitality. Besides the work, I love to travel, do yoga and spend time with my friends and family!
Na Su
I am a Biology teacher in Jinan Foreign Language School. In the spring 2016, I was invited to be the second PI for the iGEM team JNFLS_China. And I found I was interested in Synthetic Biology and iGEM gradually. I really enjoyed seeing that my students were doing experiments in the lab. iGEM offers them an amazing opportunity to make their idea to reality. This is the first iGEM team in Shandong province. I hope these students can continue this activity, which let more and more students to participate in iGEM
Two Instructors
Wei Tian
I am the instructor of iGEM team JNFLS_China, as well as the homeroom teacher of some team members in Jinan Foreign Language School. Passion and enthusiasm are the two most important things accompanying my teaching work, so I spare no effort in helping my brilliant students to go forward. I pay hard effort, but meanwhile, I gain much more than that. It is their bright future that lights my teaching career. Besides those mentioned above, I am also a big fan of sports after work.
Dr. Xia Xu
It is my honor to be an instructor of JNFLS_China. I am responsible for the safety of whole team members in the lab. They were trained before the experiment starting. In the whole processes, I sensed the passion of these high school students in this summer. All of them are very interested in Synthetic Biology and iGEM competition. They worked hard and sometimes they worked till the midnight in the lab. However they learned a lot and they are growing researchers. They had lot of fun in this summer!

I am a character，cheerful boy，I like playing football and table tennis in my spare time. Because my parients are doctors, they always talk about biology science, and our bookshelf is packed with all kinds of medical books. So I read a lot of biology books in my spare time. Also I got some knowledge from internet. Sometimes, when I find some interesting experiments, I will try to do them by myself. I really got interested in synthetic biology and iGEM.
Zeyang Li
I'm Zeyang Li, a senior high school student. As the founder of BC (biochemistry club) in our school, a club holding seminars and working on biochemistry projects, I have deep understandings of chemistry on a molecular level. I built a chemistry lab in my garage by myself and investigated simple reactions. I'm also a lab assistant in Shandong Agricultural University, molecular biology department. Besides, I am keen to Chinese calligraphy and playing the piano. Participating iGEM is an awesome thing in this summer! It’s like to be an gene player.

Brandon Ford
Molecular Biologist of House Glow-in-the-Dank
Brandon is a Molecular Biologist and our team’s very own Pun Generator. He is sometimes known as the Brandopedia for his approximate knowledge of many things. When asked about his “inner funk”, his answer was “I would say that my skin is very good at keeping my inner funk inside where it belongs, but when that fails, I use a plaster or bandage.”         Brandon is a dispenser of accurate and valuable information and in general, a complete know-it-all cool dude. Hey can we have this list in surname alphabetical order? I don't want to be first -BF
Wesley Ho
Economist and P+P Co-ordinator of House Dorito-Dog
Wesley is an Economist and describes himself as a noisy character that likes to make sure that we’re all awake at every point of team time. He is passionate about Economics and enjoys teaching everyone and anyone who shows interest (this includes times when we’re all tired at the end of the meetings). He is often overwhelmed by the level of science but always does his best to understand and has become our ‘simplicity seal of approval’ for the scientists. He forms one half of Hansley #WeShipHansley
Hannah Macfarlane
Biomedical Scientist and P+P Co-ordinator of House Hannzilla
Hannah is a part-time Biomedical Scientist, part-time Policy and Practices enthusiast. She is always full of ideas for how we can interview and talk to more patients or people and is also the other half of Hansley (see Wesley above for first half). #WeShipHansley
Wai Ching Lin
Bioengineer and Modelling Expert of House Wai-Ching-For-Love
Wai Ching is a Bioengineering student that loves to model systems and do basically anything and everything computer-related. She is of House Wai-Ching-For-Love because if you replace “Waiting” with “Wai Ching” in Avicii’s song “Waiting For Love”, it actually sounds better. Go on. Try it.
Oana Pelea
Geneticist and Microbiologist of House Flower Fairy
Miss Pelea of House Flower Fairy is our team hipster. She always has a smile on her face and is consistently enthusiastic even when everyone else gets down. Almost devout to the ways of veganism with an exception from our trips to Paris, London and that takeaway…           Being of House Flower Fairy, she loves all life and treats her experiments like her babies.         She can be very nice but has a fierce streak to be blunt and ask people to get straight to the point. Beating around the bush is NOT an option.
James “you-havin’-a-giggle-mate” Gratton
Control Systems and Robotics Engineer of House Lubricator
James is our Chief Graphics Designer, Wiki Builder and All-Round-Tech-Monkey. He’s the genius behind our logo and our-all-time-provider of British slang...that’s where his middle name comes from. “U wot mate?” He’ would like to think he artistic visionary and is never satisfied with anything artistic.         Of House Lubricator (don’t ask), James is one of the three engineers from our team who has also quite recently been known for his obsession with carrots. #JamesAndHisCarrot
Magdelana Dabrowska
Biochemist and Head Microbiologist of House Vodka
Magda is the mama of the Microbiology. Yes, you heard us.          She always seems to know exactly what she’s doing and can be seen dashing around the lab working on the team’s next bacterial monstrosity.           Due to her Polish heritage and her belonging to House Vodka, she has acquired a high tolerance of alcohol, in particular vodka. Magda is always keen on sharing this talent with the rest of the teams on socials, even if they cannot possibly take another shot! Note to self: Do NOT enter a drinking contest with her.
Jamie ""Jaimito"" Grimshaw
Molecular Biologist and Modeller of House Sly Fox
Jamie is the calm and collected kid of the group. Of House Sly Fox, Jamie likes to play the Devil's Advocate in team discussions. In the man’s own words, “I am innately boring, but not to the point where that is particularly interesting.”
Jake Edmans
Chemist of House Troll
Jake, of House Troll, is the chemistry expert of the group.  But, he'll frequently don a disguise and work alongside the biologists, ""Day 33, and they still suspect nothing."" Jake will happily eat his whole meal and then take ALL leftover food donations from everyone else in the group.
Saylee Jangam
Bioengineer and Device Expert of House Jennifer
The Social Media Queen of the group, Saylee, has an endless list of contacts that she can talk to about the project. She is always pushing the team to be lively and even more social (even if most of them want a quiet night in to themselves). In Paris, Saylee found her belonging to her long-lost House, House Jennifer. For those who don’t already know, Jen is her not-so-annoying alter ego. Don’t worry, you’ll come across her in Boston.

Dimitrios Michailidis
House of Broccoli
Dimitrios is a microbiologist, with a obsession to find out what inspires people. When asked how he got involved with iGEM, he said, ""I was presented in front of a panel of 3 agents, they might have just been professors. Frank Sinatra – I mean Frank Sargent of the United Nations, I mean University of Dundee, was staring at me through his dark sunglasses. Cigar in mouth. Next to him, his wife Tracy aka Scarlet, fresh from a saloon performance, and Tywin Lannister. I mean Tywin (Dyce Davidson) is a really nice guy after getting past his scary-looking face. Give him a beer, and he will go crazy at an iGEM party from starting a conga line to throwing an inflatable donkey to the DJ (who was also an iGEM judge)."" He got so addicted to iGEM after being in a team in 2014, that he helped out the next team in 2015 in Dundee. Even when he came down to Sheffield for his PhD, there was no stopping him! Since there was no ongoing iGEM team at Sheffield, he just made his own!
Guilherme Kundlatsch
House of Brazil
A 19-year-old Brazilian Biotechnology student on a year-long exchange programme studying Molecular Biology at the University of Sheffield, Guilherme is a former handball player, former chess player, former writer, former iGEMmer and a dreamer, still searching for his place on this pale blue dot. Guilherme is always looking for his next, big adventure. “Let’s climb that sea-cliff? I’m in! Let’s dive in that waterfall in the middle of a mountain lost in the jungle? Count me in! Let’s do some sea kayaking during a crazy storm? I’ll be there!”. He has traveled to around 19 countries in 4 different continents doing crazy stuff – and he’s still working on this list. In his free time, he likes to write and his first book (a science fiction adventure) was published last year. He is also the only adviser not currently doing his PhD at the University of Sheffield – impressive stuff at just 20!
Kyle Buchan
House of Freedom
Kyle is a Microbiologist, professional science enthusiast, and a general all-round nerd. He got into this line of work when he sat down one day (around the same time he was told that the mitochondria were the powerhouse of cells) and realised that wee stuff was cool, partly because it could kill you, partly because it’s invisible and partly because there’s more of it inside you than there have ever been humans! His iGEM story started three years ago, when he was a ne’er do well Microbiology undergrad in his third year at the University of Dundee. They designed and developed a project called ‘Toximop!’ which involved E. coli engineered to soak up a common toxin in water bodies – microcystin. “Since then I have helped to start the Sheffield iGEM team, who are going to blow your minds with Iron and Blood!” he adds.
Felix Weihs
House of Thesis Panic
Felix is a 3rd year PhD student in Sheffield working on round bacteria around their roundness (actually true). To be able to cover his travel plans (he has one continent left!), he needs money and time. He thinks there is no worse plan than doing science research and if he thinks about it, he is doing something wrong. “Time to get a real job…” When asked how he got involved with iGEM, his answer was “Every team needs a German. It just works better this way.”
John Howard
House of Jukebox
John is a 1st year PhD student in the Department of Biomedical Science and the Department of Chemical & Biological Engineering who works on chemically improving RNA interference in insects. John originally did his undergrad in Chemical Engineering with Biotechnology, but decided hi-vis vests and hard hats didn’t really suit him, so traded in his distillation column for a pipette. John was roped into iGEM by Kyle’s “please help out with iGEM” presentation, where he’s pretty sure that Kyle used Jedi mind tricks to convince him….John is a musical nutter who plays the piano, saxophone, organ, mouth organ, oboe, spoons, paper and comb, empty beer bottles and pretty much any other musical instrument that happens to be passing, and has a some say lovable (some say annoying) tendency to break into song at the slightest provocation.
Nicholas R Moody
House of literally anything else
Nick is the advisor chemist. He is fascinated by the interface between biology and chemistry; life evolved using a minute amount of specific chemicals in specific conditions. Living organisms built instructions in DNA and molecular machines to control its environment and keep the essentials processes working. Multicellular system can sometimes seem almost mind boggling.  Understanding how fundamental chemistry interacts with the madness of life is what drives his personal fascination with science.He got involved with iGEM through Kyle, one of the other advisers. “Kyle and I both play in the university brass band,” he says, “We were both in the pub after a concert when he ambushed me, the idea of looking at an interdisciplinary project seemed fascinating, I could hardly say no!”
Jonny Coates
House of Shark
“I love what I do. Being on the very edge of what is known and unknown and bring the first person to discover something that no previous person has ever known is amazing,” says Jonny, “the child-like curiosity with the world never went away, it just matured into asking more questions.”  He believes he is lucky enough to do a job where not only does he get to continue asking questions about the world but also gets to go out and find the answers. When asked about how he got involved with iGEM, he said, “Kyle. It was all his fault…”.  Jonny isn’t your stereotypical scientist. When he’s not in the lab, he can be found doing a range of somewhat dangerous activities (motorcycles, skydiving, climbing…anything at the more extreme end of things).
Carlos Luna
House of Salsa
Carlos shared with us that when he’s not eating tacos (not from Tacobell at least), he’s engineering super intelligent systems for automatic control. His high tech robots will one day rule the world – save – I mean save the world. It’s not like the ‘Grey Hats’ are using his surreal programming skills for their own gains. When asked how he got involved, Carlos shared with us “That guy called Leon – I mean Dimitrios – Leon is his shadow – friend! – I meant friend, got me all fired up about iGEM”. Carlos disclosed a few words about Dimitrios’ approach of recruiting him. “There was a lot of pestering, nagging, stalking, and whispering”. Many people try to scout him to recruit his inquisitive – if he says so himself – mind.
Dr. Dorian Florescu
House of Florescu
Dorian is a fresh postdoctoral researcher at the University of Sheffield in the department of Automatic Control and Systems Engineering. He supports the team by giving advice on mathematical modelling. When asked about how he got involved with iGEM, he said “I heard about the competition from Dimitrios and it instantly caught my attention!""

Device
James Gratton designed and built the electronic device. Saylee and Wai Ching designed, built and tested the microfluidics chips. The Insigneo Institute for in silico medicine allowed us access to the Cellular Mechanics and Microfluidics Lab and provided us with materials and equipment for making the microfluidics chips. Dr. Cecile Perrault gave us permission to use her lab and advised us on the initial ideas for the microfluidics design. Luke Boldock taught us how to manufacture microfluidics chips. Both he and Claudia Wittkowske advised us on the design of the microfluidics chips. Dr Sean R Anderson advised us on the design of the fluorometer and a larger mixing device. Dr. David Chau advised us on the freeze-drying of our bacterial cells. Martyn Aspinall helped with laser cutting a prototype of the device.

To accomplish this project, we are proud to say that our team work together:
* initiate the idea of biosensors for detecting toxins in Chinese herb medicine
* explore the issues of toxins in Chinese herb medicine
* identify the goal of our project
* layout the project framwork and plan
* complete experiments, human practice, wiki, film and all work.
But this project wouldn’t be complete without the help of many dedicated people. Everyone in the team is in charge of different tasks such as the synthetic biology part, the experiments, the wiki, the product design, the short film etc. We were fortunate enough to have advisors, experts and senior undergraduate students who participated in the making of this project. We especially appreciated the collaboration with NYMU-Taipei on the media analysis of our human practice (refer to their web on https://2016.igem.org/Team:NYMU-Taipei/Collaborations ). We can’t thank them enough for helping us with the idea discussions, guiding us through the experiments, and providing us with necessary advice at crucial times. Thank you!
Collaboration
1. Collaboration on Media Analysis of gene technology related information  with NYMU-Taipei
Motivation with passion: Our team believe that media is the most efficient way to promote the knowledge and popularity of gene technology /synthetic biology(GTSB), not through sporadically independent advocate or educational activities .  Thus, we are curious and concerned about what gene technology related information in the media that the Taiwanese people are exposed to and whether the Taiwanese people can understand the information.  Thus, we told the NYMU-Taipei team about our idea to consult them.  NYMU-Taipei revealed their passion to iGEM and ambitiously suggested that we should do something for iGEM to support its influence on synthetic biology worldwide.
Goal: Thus, we decided to work together to conduct a large-scaled media analysis on the gene technology related information to make it as a significant project for GTSB.  In this way, using social study methods, we can provide solid and essential academic evidences that can be used in future design, plan, and implement science education in GTSB.  Thus, our goal is to investigate the media context on gene technology related information, and identify issues of the context.
Work on media analysis project: We analyzed the sufficiency and readability of media context on gene technology related information from magazines, newspapers and iGEM wiki.  We worked on defining the goal and scope of this project together.  NYMU-Taipei was in charge of establishing conceptual framework of our media analysis, designing survey sheets (codebook) based on the framework, and retrieving iGEM wiki; HSiTAIWAN is in charge of designing survey sheets(codebook), accomplishing data collection.  We analyze the data together and the results can be retrieved from the section of the Human Practice section on two teams.
2. Academic conference, meetings, lab work
We are fortunate to have opportunities to work with two iGEM teams of NTHU_Taiwan and NYMU-Taipei. We worked together for discussing problems we faced and together figured out solutions for improving the protein performance in experiments.  In addition to attending the 4th iGEM Asia-Pacific Conference 2016 Taiwan, we have many chances to discuss our iGEM project with these two universities.   Particularly, NYMU-Taipei team gave us lectures that we need to proceed our project, and also technical supports when we had problems
Professional Support
We received full professional supports from the best universities in Taiwan.  Professors and graduate students also fully sponsored and supported our experiments in their laboratories.
Technical Support
To accomplish this project, students of high school indeed need tremendous technical supports including wiki, film, field experience, and so on.  All experts that we interviewed in our human practice also spent a lot of time in discussing the experiment and science related to our project.  We appreciated their kind technical supports to our project.
Practical Support
We received a lot of help and advice from universities, industry, NGO and government departments. They gave us not only advice but also linkage to other resources that we needed for our project.   With their important help, we can improve the quality of our project and make our project closer to the social need."

Hello, we are the 2016 Dundee Schools team from (you guessed it) Dundee, a small city on the East coast of Scotland. Pictured above is where the magic happened, a.k.a. our project; it is the College of Life Sciences, a building owned by Dundee University (who also so very kindly funded us, hint hint here's our Attributions page, which also tells you a bit more about what we all did to contribute to our project).
Below you will find everything you need to know about who we are. Most of it, anyway.

Throughout our project we have received support and help from a whole variety of people, and we would like to extend our gratitude to everyone involved.
We would like to thank Prof. Frank Sargent, Prof. Tracy Palmer and Prof. Fordyce Davidson, who made this amazing opportunity became a reality by putting our team together and securing both that oh-so-crucial funding and a place in which to work that allowed us to take part in iGEM. They have also aided greatly by guiding us through various aspects of our project, ranging from the biology behind it to maths modelling.
A big thank you to our amazing advisors Fatima Ulhuq, Alex Finney and John Allan, who all helped us tremendously with teaching us how to work in a lab, as well as guiding us through our project. Big thanks also to our other advisor Lucas J. Morales Moya, who taught us maths modelling from scratch and could always find time in which to help us with it.
The same to the Dundee University collegiate team for working alongside us and always being on hand to help out, as well as for being fun to spend breaks with.
We would also like to give a big thank you to:
Erin Stanbridge, Division Secretary - for always helping to organise everything and anything, including train journeys and flights. Oh, and that beautifully stocked stationary cupboard *wipes tear*.
Dr Jackie Heilbronn, Lab Manager - for teaching us all of the lab safety protocols and making sure we stayed safe.
Dr Grant Buchanan for teaching us a lot about microbiology, providing help, giving us samples of Serratia marcescens and E. coli gDna, and for making us laugh with his jokes.
We would also like to thank the Sarah Coulthurst lab for providing us with Serratia Db10 gDNA.
IT Department of Dundee University for providing us with access to the Uni network, which allowed us to do a lot of work (and access to free wifi, for super important researching and Pokémon hunting reasons).
Central Technical Services of Dundee University for providing us with clean and sterilised equipment, as well as various media used in our project.
MRC PPU DNA Sequencing and Services, for giving us free sequence runs.
The Garland Café in the Life Sciences building, for making dem gewd bacon rolls and for keeping Darryl alive on Monday mornings with coffee.
Olawale Raimi for providing us with Rhamnose in a crucial moment where we ran out.
Brian Walshe from the charity Mercy Ships, for not ignoring us and for referring us to Rob Porter.
Rob Porter, Consultant of Microbiology and Infection - for giving us a lot of detailed feedback on our initial ideas/plans, as well as raising excellent questions that helped shape our project.

Albert Brown
Throughout my summer, I mostly worked in the lab. With the guidance of the advisors Fatima, John and Alex, I was able to learn a lot about working there, and have been able to carry things out independently when required (such as cloning or further producing our final constructs). The Dundee collegiate wet team members aided greatly in learning the initial ways of how I should go about doing my work; I was also particularly helped by John when performing experiments with the constructs to see if our osmY-hfq fusion was being secreted.
Bartosz Witkowski
Throughout our 8 weeks of iGEM, I worked mainly in the labs to do cloning and experiments. With the help of our lab advisors, John, Fatima and Alex, I was involved in the cloning of our BioBricks and further characterisation by doing experiments such as western blots. I also helped with successfully cloning the spiRNA and working on the motility assays. During the early stages of our lab work I was also helped a lot by the Dundee collegiate team as they showed me how to carry out basic procedures and the art of using a pipette. When I wasn’t in the lab I was working on the wiki content, the presentation or learning some of the concepts behind maths modelling.
Matthew Simmons
I worked mostly in the lab; with the help of the lab advisors, I put most of my time into producing our secretion system, which secreted the fusion construct cloned with help from Bartosz, Albert and Mia. Thanks to them, I was able to learn a lot on how to do the various procedures required to produce our construct. In the beginning of the summer the Dundee collegiate team greatly helped me develop the skills needed, and from their experience I have learned not to repeat their mistakes - such as not labelling test tubes.
Individual Attributions: Dry Team
Mia Wood
So that we could get everything done, my time was split 50/50 between the dry and wet teams (wiki coder note: we include her as an honorary dry team member anyway for a satisfyingly even split. Also since it's the better team). In the lab I did a lot of work in making the initial construct and performing the tests on it with the help of John, Fatima and Alex. Working together with the rest of my team in the lab made it very enjoyable, and allowed us to help each other and share our knowledge. When I wasn’t in the lab I would be working with Beth and Darryl on human practices/outreach, contacting various specialists to get their insight into our project. I also worked on the maths modelling with Beth, Bartosz, and Darryl, with the help of Lucas and Prof. Fordyce Davidson. Special shout-out to Fatima for driving me home in time for the Great British Bake Off after being in the lab until late.
Beth Rear
Throughout our project I was mostly part of the dry team, involving myself in maths modelling with help from Lucas and Prof. Fordyce Davidson. I was also focused on the human practices aspect of our project, working together with Mia and Darryl to develop this. Once that was done, I started working on our presentation and poster together with the rest of the team. (She may be a technophobe, but most of the lovely diagrams you see throughout our wiki and on presentation slides were by her and her unexpected Powerpoint prowess). However, I would occasionally be found in the lab helping out with any work to be done, particularly towards the final stages of the project.
Darryl Sime
During our project, I took on the job of coding/bringing together the team’s wiki. With limited prior knowledge of HTML and CSS, I decided to teach myself them using Codecademy, W3Schools, and the wonders of Google. When I hit a snag, I'd also seek guidance when needed from John, or Chris Nelis from the Dundee collegiate team. I also worked on human practices with Mia and Beth, plus a bit of maths modelling with them and Bartosz, guided by Lucas and Dyce. Big big thank you also to Ummi Jameel from the Dundee team, who provided some of the graphics you see on our wiki (team and F.B.I. logos, orange bacteria mascots), and was always there to advise with making
. Also for attempting to get good team photos of us (it didn't really work out).
Lastly we, the 2016 Dundee Schools Team, would like to give a big thank you to everyone in the Life Sciences' Molecular Microbiology Department, who were always very kind and helpful in all situations."

About Taipei American School
Taipei American School is a private independent school with an American-based curriculum located in Tianmu (T'ien-mu), Shilin District (Shih-lin), Taipei City. Most graduates of TAS go on to attend colleges and universities in United States, although some choose to attend schools in other countries. TAS strives to stay ahead of the curve in STEAM education. An important aspect of STEAM education is the 'E': Engineering. Our iGEM team represents the application of engineering beyond robotics.
About The Lab
We work in the Sandy R. Puckett Memorial Research Lab, which was completely renovated in 2013 to provide a research laboratory for on-campus student research in synthetic biology and nanotechnology. It is fully equipped with lab tools for research for the iGEM competition. The students have the opportunity to be creative and exploratory in many areas of scientific research at TAS.
Synthetic Biology
The fusion between biological research and engineering has culminated in the creation of synthetic biology. This interdisciplinary area was facilitated by the recent advances in technology, allowing humans to actually design and construct biological devices as if they were machinery. However, the advent of synthetic biology has raised concerns with biosafety and biosecurity, which is why iGEM places such importance on ""safety"".

The members were asked to describe their individual contributions to create this team project. This included how they contributed to the research, experimentation, and presentation of our project, as well as how they contributed to make this year's journey an unforgettable one.
Below are the responses. Unfortunately, not all members were able to respond, though we still thank everyone involved in our project for their contributions.
Name
Description
Huiru H.
I am the co-project head with Fiona, and I focused mainly on building BioBrick constructs, testing proof of concept, and making contact lens prototypes. I’m also in charge of eating most of the failed cupcakes and dancing with a helmet on in the lab because biosafety.
Changsun L.
I am one of the experiment heads and I worked on building Biobrick constructs, finalizing the chitosan nanoparticle procedures and devising protein release experiment. I also worked on miniprep purifying the proteins produced from our BioBrick constructs. I wanted to find a treatment for cataracts because it is the leading cause of blindness according to WH2O2.
Fiona T.
I had a ton of fun (and stress) building and documenting DNA parts, adding compounds into cataracts model, and purifying proteins that didn’t get eluted!
Avery W.
I was in charge of modeling and wiki. People who visited our poster should recognize me by the sign I held: “Ask me about my modeling! ☺ For modeling, I researched, coded, analyzed, and typed all five mathematical models on prototype design, and built the nanoparticle calculator (software). For wiki, I coded the wiki HTML/CSS/JS pages, including the cataracts animation in the background that sadly no one noticed. I was also in charge of setting and enforcing deadlines for wiki pages, which as expected did not work out.
When my eyes started to hurt after staring at a laptop screen, I played a crucial role in experiments serving as a secondary eppendorf holder, during which I patiently listened to Changsun or Huiru’s complaints about their experiments (and usually making them even more frustrated). I also documented the entire Boston trip through my selfies ( see example ).
Dennis J.
I am the safety head. I contributed other members in their experiments, research, and modeling. You have to remember, looks are deceiving, so do not forget to check your lab benches twice!
Austin L.
I free-rided on all the hard work of the seniors and used this purely as a way to build my resume.   The resume-building part didn’t really work.
I contributed mainly to literature research, and helped with the initial spring-boarding of the counteracts idea. In addition to literature research, I helped with policies and practice by bringing a few individuals for interviews. I also worked part-time on experiments, as I am otherwise known as the ""miniprep-machine""
Alvin W.
I came into the lab everyday to warm up for a tennis game with exp_mas. Occasionally I read my summer reading. Otherwise, I blended ice cream with apple juice, froze Huiru’s hair with liquid nitrogen, gauged fish eyes without cleaning up, and ordered Pizzahut. In total, I had spent 10 hours of work to make a 2-minute video on how to make nanoparticles.
Angela L.
I am in charge of Human Practice. Throughout the year, I’ve worked on building programs to educate middle school students about synthetic biology, reaching out to eye doctors and veterinarians, interviewing cataracts patients, planning the bioethics panel, drafting the marketing plan, as well as holding fundraiser events. Other fun stuff I do include being forced by Changsub to clean up the lab for him, accidently leaving my milk from lunch in the minifridge several times, experimental baking with Hellen, failing frosting cupcakes with Huiru, and constantly stealing Dr. Chiang’s candies!
Moksha S.
Other than providing sarcastic banter, Indian food, and healthy ego bashing- I focused on making and imaging nanoparticles (our delivery prototype), contacting experts, and organizing fundraisers and public awareness events.
Justin Y.
I am the official pipette tip filler, trash dumper and autoclave master (aka “the lab slave”) -- just kidding -- I am in charge of the majority of graphic design, namely the team banner, poster and diagrams on the wiki. If anybody needed a graphic for their section, they came for me. Underneath all the colorful diagrams and cute infographics however, was a whole ton of stress and hard work, but I enjoyed it nonetheless!
Megan Y.
Aside from creating the marketing plan and taking over HP after the seniors left, during the jamboree, I shared my yummy peanut butter cups with everyone when they were hungry, and I (& Justin) caused the flight delay from JP to Boston:D (if that counts as a contribution) Anyways, I’m glad that I got to go to the jamboree, and I had a great time!!!
Leon Y.
I worked over the summer on cloning and sequencing the parts with extremely large bandwidth. It was a lot of fun and work to get through all the cloning cycles with the team. I also acted as a moral supporter before the final presentation!

ATTRIBUTIONS
Our iGEM journey started at the end of 2015 when EPFL students were invited to join in the 2016 iGEM team. After the selection, we started brainstorming in February 2016 where after a few months of literature research we came up with this project of combining CRISPR-dCas9 and the Cello software. Between the beginning of June and July, we designed and ordered all the parts we needed. And then finally, in July, we were able to start our exciting work in the lab! And we have been working hard ever since then to present our end results to all the other teams and jury members end of October in Boston, MA.
Our project is partially based on the project of the 2015 EPFL iGEM team. The general design of the gates comes from their BioLogic project.

Our Team
Our team is composed of 9 motivated students currently in 3rd year of Bachelor in Life Science at EPFL. Accompanied by 2 PhD Students and 2 professors we started our iGEM experience in February 2016. After 9 month of hard work, laughs and cries we are very proud of what we achieved during this summer. The motivation and knowledge of every person in the team helped each other to move forward. We knew each other before iGEM but now we are like a big family, knowing fun facts and small defaults of each other.
Members
Remy
Great friend, very energetic and has no problem to talk to anyone whether he knows the person or not. He's the kind of guy that when he drinks a coffee, goes 15 min into the highway and then realizes that he forgot the car at home, also the kind of guy who kicks a piece of ice and breaks a toe. Fun fact: he can jump as high as his height with both legs. Fun fact 2: He can (probably) drink a beer column taller than him without much trouble.
Camilla
Camilla loves basically two things in the everyday lab: Gibson and partying hard. Who said that going out and having some fun wasn’t on the weekly TO DO lab list ? When you are dead tired after many hours spent in the lab, and Camilla asks you to have party you just can’t say no. The Kraken rum and the Gibson Master mix are her favourites. She wrote a new protocol for the transformation in bacteria after Gibson Assembly that is more efficient than the NEB’s one. So, whoever said you can’t combine hard work and partying clearly hasn’t met the skillful Camilla.
Alix
If you don’t know where the ampicillin 100X is, or where to find the buffer P1, the salmon sperm or simply the parafilm, don’t worry! Alix will always tell you how to find them! And if you forget how much SD you need for a bacterial inoculation, or how much adenine sulfate you need for a yeast medium, or just when the meeting with TAs is, Alix luckily always knows. But at the same time, if you find a phone, a Mac charger, a sweatshirt, or a student card, or again a wallet, sadly neglected in the heart of the LAB, it is definitely propriety of Alix!
Dimitri
He’s the American guy of our team! Always there when we have to put on a show, he spent the whole summer commentating the American election and he’s the best for imitating Trump.
During the summer, when he was not watching Ted Talk about the life changing questions, the universe and everything, Dimitri was on his computer, coding for the software part of our project and also on the wiki.
Always in a good mood, Dimitri was a really funny teammate always available for our English-writing questions. If you would like to meet him you could probably find him competing in the next Crossfit Games.
As he hasn’t been in USA for years, he told us that he might cry when landing in Boston… To be seen!
Francesco
Francesco seems calm, collected, and level-headed but that’s only because people don’t know that he’s constantly repeating Kanye West lyrics in his head. Apart from repeating the bass line to “Jesus Walks” and “I Need a Dollar”, Francesco also enjoys long walks on the beach, and eating Dimitri’s EPFL-famous cookies. When asked what he would like to do when he’s grown up, he’s most likely to just reply “swag” while casually flipping through the latest edition of Nature. At the end of the day, he “keeps it 300, like the Romans”.
If you need to analyze the results of the FACS or import Russia's finest vodka he's your man!
Samuele
You cannot say Samuele without saying Barbeque genius. There is simply no other person who knows how to combine meat, beer and spices like Samuele.
It might be that Samuele has a direct connection to God, and we credit his prayers for the Biobricks finally assembling. Furthermore if you need to target a specific region of a genome just ask him, he knows what to do.
Samuele likes all things “original”, and will always seek out the most authentic versions or experiences in life, whether it be coffee, rap, or Swedish massages. When meeting someone for the first time, behind his beaming smile, he is probably thinking, “do you even TRX bro?”
Yassine
Yassine is kind of a modern time knight: always on his trusty steed (his bike), always ready to draw a pipette tip to inoculate any strain of bacteria or yeast and glycerol-stocking everything that stands in his path. He stops at nothing, even redoing a figure for the wiki a hundred times! But, like everyone, he has his darker side… He knows by heart the CRISPR-Cas9 song and always gets it into our heads. We discovered some of his hidden skills during the summer. For example, he can eat 4 « éclairs au chocolat » in a row and still feeling fresh and relaxed right after! In short, he is truly unique.
Marie
She is our smiling tornado - she comes early to the lab, gets things done, put the yeast in the oven, and leaves the aftermath for all to see.
Marie has been a fundamental component of our lab team during the whole summer, but we should not overlook her trusty lighter, without whom we could not have lit our burners for our sterile techniques.
During this experience she has surely earned the title of integration queen, but keep her away from the minipreps!
At the end of the day, when all experiments went as planned with Marie it is going to be ""Apéro"" time!
Pietro
He is our personal “Neo”, our friendly hacker who reveals to us every day the most hidden tricks of coding.
Circadians cycles simply don’t apply to Pietro; he will be working every hour of the day… and every hour of the night too! Always exploring new techniques like “If I sleep thirty minutes after every three hours for five days straight I won’t need any more sleep for the rest of the month”.
Pietro is a guy full of resources and qualities, maybe inline skating at night is not one of them..but you can always count on his good mood!
He stays prepared for a potential zombie apocalypse by trying open doors by throwing his pass-card at them.
Team Instructors and Advisors
Bart Deplancke
He’s our “Groovescience”! Always very busy, he took the time between saving the world and improving science to solve all our big issues in less than 1 hour. If you have any questions about yeast integration, ask him before the 2016 iGEM EPFL team. Cheers from Vienna.
Barbara Grisoni
She is our expert eye! She passed by every day in the lab in a flash. With all the rigor of a scientist, she asked us about every step of the protocols and to explain every single band of all the agarose gels we made… We cannot hide anything from her!
Roel Bevers
Roel is dutch and very funny. He likes beer, good jokes, politically incorrect jokes and spaghetti. He certainly chose the wrong job, not because he is not good at research, which he is, but because he was simply born to be a comedian. He is going to realise soon…
Riccardo Dainese
Riccardo is Italian and laughs at jokes. Since he started his PhD he likes beer. He also likes banana’s and loves pasta (prepared by his mom!). He truly loves his job – full of passion and working hard so he can visit Roel’s evening comedy shows. Riccardo is Roel’s best audience…"

Jacky Cheung
Jacky Cheung is a 3rd year CC student at Columbia   University, and he is currently a pre-medical student   majoring in Computer Science and Biology. Apparently,   according to the Meyer-Briggs personality test, his   personality type is ENFP (A.K.A The Campaigner). He is   not quite sure how he feels about this. He has been   involved in Synthetic Biology research since high   school and this year is his third year participating   in iGEM. His emoji of choice is :p because he enjoys   teasing his friends, but ^.^ and XD are a close second   and third. To relax, he enjoys taking long walks along   the pier and messing with his friends (especially   Hudson). Something he is known for is asking to get   cheesecake or pie at 2 A.M after finishing long coding   assignments because he is dopamine-deprived. He is   named after Hong-Kong pop sensation Jacky Cheung; and   one of his aspirations in life is to top the   aforementioned celebrity on Google after doing a   search of his name.
Ross is a PhD student in the Biological Sciences   Program. He received his B.S. from University of   Texas, Austin.
Carlotta is a postdoctoral fellow in the lab. She   received his PhD in Metabolic And Genetic Engineering   from Denmark Technical University.
Sonja Billerbeck is a postdoctoral fellow in the   Cornish Laboratory. She received her PhD in 2013 at   the Swiss Institute of Technology (ETH Zürich) in the   interdisciplinary Department for Biosystems Science   and Engineering (D-BSSE). Prior to coming to the ETH   Zürich, she was awarded a master's in biology from the   University of Tübingen, Germany for a master's thesis   performed at the Max Planck Institute for   Developmental Biology in the Department of Protein   Evolution studying the function of archeal chaperones.
During her doctoral studies, Dr. Billerbeck developed   a novel strategy for the rational design of switchable   proteins for application in cell-free   biotechnology. Her current research interest revolves   around the field of synthetic biology, with special   emphasis on protein engineering strategies applied to   understand and functionalize bacterial   microcompartments. She was awarded a fellowship from   the Swiss National Science Foundation, and in 2014 was   named a Junior Fellow of the Simons Foundation.
Harris Wang has joined Columbia University Medical   Center as an Assistant Professor in the Columbia   Initiative in Systems Biology and the Department of   Pathology and Cell Biology. His research focuses on   understanding the evolution of the ecosystems that   develop within heterogeneous microbial   communities. Using approaches from genome engineering,   DNA synthesis, and next-generation sequencing, he   studies how genomes in microbial populations form,   maintain themselves, and change over time, both within   and across microbial communities. His goal is to use   synthetic biology approaches to engineer ecologies of   microbial populations, such as those found in the gut   and elsewhere in the human body, in ways that could   improve human health.
Virginia joined the faculty of the Chemistry   Department at Columbia in 1999, where she carries out   research at the interface of chemistry and biology,   and was promoted to Associate Professor with tenure in   2004 and then Professor in 2007. Her laboratory brings   together modern methods in synthetic chemistry and DNA   technology to expand the synthetic capabilities of   living cells.
Ken joined Columbia University in 1997, where he is   now Professor of Electrical Engineering. At the same   time, he co-founded CadMOS Design Technology, an EDA   start-up which pioneered PacifIC and CeltIC, the first   tools for large-scale signal integrity analysis of   digital integrated circuits. The success of these   tools led Cadence to acquire CadMOS in 2001.Current   research interests interests focus on circuits for   VLSI integrated circuits in deeply-scaled CMOS   technologies, new technologies for electronics   applications, and the application of integrated   circuits for biology-related applications.
Prof. Tal Danino's research explores the emerging   intersection of systems biology, synthetic biology,   and engineering, focusing on building a quantitative   understanding of gene circuits and designing   biological behaviors that have technological   applications.  The interaction of microbes and tumors   is a major target of his work, where DNA sequences and   synthetic biology are used to program–microbes as   diagnostics and therapeutics in cancer.  Dr. Danino   also brings this science outside the laboratory as a   TED Fellow and through science-art projects.
Ambitious. Genius. Handsome. These adjectives only   begin to illustrate the man that is James Gornet. Born   from the fires of Hades and raised by wolves, he is   the living embodiment of freedom. Men fear   him. Children want to be him. In high school, James   Gornet researched molecular computing—a branch   of computing that utilizes DNA, biochemistry, and   molecular biology instead of silicon-based   transistors. Currently, he doing research in   developmental neurobiology and axon   pathfinding. Majoring in biomedical engineering with a   minor in neuroscience, James Gornet hopes to pursue a   PhD in computational and molecular neuroscience. His   Myers-Briggs personality is ENTJ—known for the   commander disposition. His emoji of choice is 濾 because he was pressured by Rachel Mintz to put one in   his biography. In his spare time, James Gornet enjoys   exploring New York City and frequenting concerts.
Kirsten Jung is originally from Seoul, Korea, but   moved to the U.S. 8 years ago because her 15-year-old   self mistakenly thought she could survive in a foreign   country on her own and somehow managed to successfully   convince her parents to leave her behind.  She is a   rising senior at Columbia University, majoring in   chemical engineering and music.  She works at a   protein engineering laboratory on campus, specifically   studying the metabolon structure of TCA cycle enzymes   and their enzymatic activities.  Once graduating, she   plans to attend a graduate school and to pursue her   Ph.D. in chemical engineering, but ultimately she   hopes to work in a R&D department of a   pharmaceutical company.  Her Myers Briggs personality   is ESFJ, ""the consuls,"" and she doesn't have an emoji   of choice because her cynical self thinks she is too   cool to use an emoji.  In her spare time, she enjoys   running, exploring the city, and cooking.
Hudson Lee is a New York City native currently on the   Pre-med track in his third year at Columbia College as   a Biology major with a Psychology concentration.  He   was a member of the 2015 Columbia NYC iGEM team and   hopes to attend medical school upon graduation.  His   Myers Briggs personality result is INFP and emoji of   choice is :trollface: as he enjoys messing with his   friends in his spare time.  Other pastimes include   several styles of dance including hip-hop, multiple   styles of ballroom, and long walks on the beach.
Vincent “Venti” Liu is originally from Beijing, China   and moved to Walnut, California five years ago. He is   a sophomore at Columbia Engineering majoring in   Computer Science and also pursuing a minor in   Statistics. Previously, he had worked in two molecular   biology laboratories while in high school and spent a   year in a biomaterials laboratory at Columbia. He   boasts a Meyers-Briggs personality of ESTJ “The   Executive”, which he thinks is the best of all. As a   consequence of his altruistic personality and   muscular, 6’3 physique, lab members respectfully refer   to him as The Spotter, and not surprisingly his emoji   of choice is, which really isn’t even a choice of   his; it just makes sense. In his pastime, Vincent   enjoys photography, bartending (exclusively for his   friends, sorry), practicing Krav Maga, and getting   swole. Though very cool, Vincent is actually chill and   friendly, unlike the ostentatious and self-obsessed   James.
Theresa Mensah is a rising junior from Accra,   Ghana. She is a Biochemistry major with research   experience working with the Immunology Department of   the Noguchi Memorial Institute for Medical   Research. Upon graduation, she plans to either   immediately pursue a PhD in either Pharmacology or   Immunology, or take a year off to intern with WHO or   L’Oreal. Her Myers Briggs personality is INTJ, The   Architect.  and her fave emoji is ^0^, because it can   portray amusement, alarm, gloating, excitement and   shock all at the same time; an amalgam of emotions,   that is of course, necessary to portray at   times. Theresa's leisure activities include learning   languages (speak 5 fluently, and 3 like a   kindergartener, hey, I'm trying!), volunteering to   teach high schoolers about science in the Double   Discovery Center, and climbing things: hills, trees...   tall friends... all climbable surfaces welcome.
Rachel Mintz is from Long Island, New York. She is a   second year student majoring in biomedical   engineering. In high school, she worked in a medicinal   biochemistry laboratory for three summers. At   Columbia, she works in a nanotherapeutics and stem   cell engineering laboratory. Upon graduation she plans   to pursue an MD-PhD. Her Myers Briggs personality is   INTJ, and her emoji of choice is the alien () because   some (most) people think she is out of this world. In   her spare time, she enjoys seeing Broadway shows and   attending concerts. She enjoys taking long,   contemplative walks (but not on the beach).
Kaitlin Pet is a senior in Columbia College majoring   in Biology and minoring in computer science. She has   previously worked on stem cell galvanotaxis with the   Bulinski Lab through the Columbia SURF program and   worked on protein informatics and structural assays   through volunteering at the Fernandez Lab. Her   favorite -.- because people are too sassy in this   world.

Personal Acknowledgements
We would like to acknowledge the work done by our      team. James Gornet cloned the BioBricks,      transformed P. putida, quantified the promoter      library strength, and designed the wiki. Rachel Mintz orchestrated the human practices      survey, implemented the keratinocyte experiments, planned      the community outreach events, and designed moderately      snazzy t-shirts. Jacky Cheung planned the      collaborations with several other iGEM teams. Theresa      Mensah designed the mice experiments and      cloned RhlAB in to S. epidermidis. Vincent Liu designed the logo and implemented the freeze-dry      experiments. Hudson Lee transformed P. putida and helped run the mosquito      experiments. Kirsten Jung quantified the      rhamnolipid output using several methods including SFC-MS, cloned RhlAB into P. putida, and run the mosquito experiments. Kaitlin Pet implemented both the mosquito and keratinocyte experiments.
Support from Principal Investigators and Mentors
We would like to thank the Principal      Investigator Harris Wang for meeting with      us on a weekly basis to discuss experimental findings,      provide advice, and track our progress as well as offering      his lab space for us to conduct experiments. We would like      to thank Virginia Cornish for allowing us      to utilize her lab space, equipment, and reagents to      conduct purification and quantification      experiments. Finally, we would like to thank Tal      Danino for helping us hone our presentation.
We would like to thank our junior and senior mentors— Carlotta Ronda, Miguel      Jimenez, Sonja Billerbeck, and Ross McBee—for continuously      providing project feedback, finding helpful articles to      hone our protocols, and helping us make connections with      other scientists.
Prince Lab at Columbia University Medical Center
Dr. Prince kindly provided keratinocytes,      human skin cells, for our experiments. She also supplied      us with the proper cell media, antibiotics, cell culture      plates, and flasks. Matthew Wickersham demonstrated proper cell culture techniques and answered      any questions that arose during our experiments. He also      provided us with a virulent strain      of P. aeruginosa.
Marraffini Lab at Rockefeller University
Thank you to Wenyan Jian who provided us with strains of Staphylococcus epidermidis. He also sent us the      protocol he uses for his experiments for Staphylococcus      epidermidis.

Advisors
This section we want to dedicate to our advisors. As most of our team members are still bachelor students and had no or only minor knowledge about actually working in a lab before getting in touch with iGEM, our advisors played an important role in starting our project. They guided us in the long process of shaping our abstract ideas into real, scientific strategies and are the reason why we can now proudly announce that we are able to organize and execute our own experiments. Here, we want to present how each of them supported our project.

Supervisor
Alongside with our advisors we also owe special thanks to our supervisors. In 2016, RWTH Aachen University has had its third iGEM team and this would have never been possible without reliable faculty members who promote the iGEM spirit. They enabled us to work on our idea by providing us with their expertise as well as resources and lab-space. We are very grateful for their support and look forward to another successful synergy between our experienced supervisors and a new iGEM team that is bubbling over with ideas in 2017.

Advisors
This section we want to dedicate to our advisors. As most of our team members are still bachelor students and had no or only minor knowledge about actually working in a lab before getting in touch with iGEM, our advisors played an important role in starting our project. They guided us in the long process of shaping our abstract ideas into real, scientific strategies and are the reason why we can now proudly announce that we are able to organize and execute our own experiments. Here, we want to present how each of them supported our project.

Supervisors
Alongside with our advisors we also owe special thanks to our supervisors. In 2016, RWTH Aachen University has had its third iGEM team and this would have never been possible without reliable faculty members who promote the iGEM spirit. They enabled us to work on our idea by providing us with their expertise as well as resources and lab-space. We are very grateful for their support and look forward to another successful synergy between our experienced supervisors and a new iGEM team that is bubbling over with ideas in 2017.

Our training and experience
Those studying science alone are all in their final semester of a three-year degree, and have taken various courses in microbiology, molecular biology and genetics, and similar fields at the University of Sydney. The two of us studying both science and engineering degrees simultaneously are also in our third year of study, but have completed less units of study in the same subject areas listed above. Sholto’s training lay in mathematics and engineering, and he’s also studying subjects in finance and business.
At the start of the iGEM season, the wet lab team were given a workshop in common laboratory techniques by Nick Coleman (see below), to ensure that there would be consistency in our practices throughout this project. A lot of learning was also done on the go as the project progressed! All website coding was done by Sholto, a self-taught skill he accumulated over the iGEM season. He had no previous experience in website front end devlepment before, though he has worked on iOS and Android apps.  The dry lab team had weekly tutorials with Ed to learn how to apply familiar engineering concepts of modelling to biological systems.
Supervision and guidance
Dr Nicholas Coleman
Dr Nick Coleman was appointed Lecturer in the School of Molecular Bioscience (SMB) in 2006, with teaching and research responsibilities in environmental and medical microbiology.
Nick has lectured to 2nd and 3rd year students across many degree programs including B.Sc., B.Med.Sci, B.Pharm., B.VetSci. and B Ag.Sci, and he has been a course coordinator and prac class coordinator for MICR2022, MICR3022, and MICR3042. Nick did his PhD in Trevor Duxbury's lab at the University of Sydney, studying explosives-biodegrading bacteria. This was the first work to investigate the aerobic biodegradation of the energetic compound RDX, and  he discovered that a cytochrome p450 enzyme was responsible for this activity. After graduating in 2001, Nick worked as a postdoc for 3 years at Tyndall Air Force Base in Florida, USA. The highlight of this work was the isolation of the first and thus-far only known bacterium able to grow on dichloroethene as a carbon source (Polaromonas strain JS666) - this bacterium has now been genome-sequenced.
Nick returned to Sydney and worked for 3 years as a postdoc in Andy Holmes' lab in SMB, studying mobile genetic elements in Pseudomonas stutzeri. This led to a new method for quantifying integron activities that could be applied in environmental bacteria. Nick's research has been supported by ARC Discovery grants, by a NSW Environmental Trust grant, and by collaborations with industry partners (eg. Orica). Nick was our hero throughout the iGEM season, and the amount of support and guidance he provided couldn’t be quantified. From teaching us new concepts (and clarifying old ones), to letting us loose in his lab, and helping us with the constant troubleshooting of protocols, we couldn’t have done this project without him. The amount of faith he had in us, even after the multitude of wonky SDS PAGE gels we presented to him asking for explanations, is what kept us going.
Brian Jones
Brian Jones is a molecular biologist with an interest in the developmental biology of food plants and wood production. He has a B.Sc in Horticulture from the UWSH, Sydney, and a PhD from ENSAT, Toulouse, France. He has spent much of his career working in Europe on various projects related to developmental biology. He has active collaborations with groups in France, Portugal, Sweden and China and has published extensively on the role of hormones in plant development.
Brian’s knowledge in horticulture was highly valued by the team, and his insights into the plant ripening process and the produce industry helped us to understand the significance and mechanism of our project. We also owe Brian a huge amount of thanks in letting us use (abuse) his large contact network to reach out to Zespri, Avocados Australia, and the Fresh Produce Group. Without him, we would not have been fortunate enough to have these interactions that proved to be critical in the development of our project.
Edward Hancock
Dr Edward Hancock is a mathematician and engineer with research interests in systems and synthetic biology. He completed a BE (Elec) and BSc (Maths) at the University of Sydney, and a DPhil (PhD) in dynamical systems and control theory at the University of Oxford. He was subsequently a post-doc in synthetic biology at the University of Oxford. He has spent time as a visiting researcher at Imperial College London and Caltech.
Lab companions
The following people are members of the Coleman lab who provided invaluable advice on-the-fly regarding everything, from making media to running gels

The Attribution requirement helps the judges know what you did yourselves and what you had help with. We don't mind if you get help with difficult or complex techniques, but you must report what work your team did and what work was done by others.
For example, you might choose to work with an animal model during your project. Working with animals requires getting a license and applying far in advance to conduct certain experiments in many countries. This is difficult to achieve during the course of a summer, but much easier if you can work with a postdoc or PI who has the right licenses.

Hello. I am Jiseng Lee. I have been a vice-president and head of human practice team. Also, I am responsible for fundraising in Korea U Seoul. The project that we are undertaking would have significant impact not only on synthetic biology field but also on our daily life.  As result, empowering the knowledge of potential risk to the public is crucial. I have been conducted several works related to informing critical impact of greenhouse and our project as alternation of energy crisis solution.

I've been working on overall works such as HP, wiki, ethics and so on. Preparing this big competition for a long time, i have learned a lot of things from all KUAS teammates.  I really appreciate them and thank to get an opportunity to participate in iGEM. Whether the result will be good or not, there will be no regret because we did all our best for this competition.  I'll never forget this precious experiences for life.

EunSan
Ko
Division of Life Science
Hello, my name is Eun San Ko. Last year, I began prepping for iGEM international competition in hopes of broadening my scope and perspectives on Biology. During the first journey, I participated in various experiments and assisted in producing a software. Now on my second year, I am in charge of advertising and fundraising for the competition. Although I started out barely knowing anything about Synthetic Biology and Biofuel Battery, I was able to grow my expertise on those fields through my experience with IGEM. Not only was I able to gain academic knowledge from the experience, but also, I was able to build bonds with numbers of people who have helped me through the competition. I would forever cherish my relationships with KUAS teammates, guidance professors, and other supporters. I truly believe it was for their support and care that I was able to overcome all the hardships that I encountered during the competition. All in all, IGEM gifted me with both the chances to broaden my knowledge in Biology and build invaluable bonds with some of the greatest people I have met in my life. Surely, participating in IGEM has marked a whole new chapter in my life as a college student.
SoHyun
Jang
Division of Life Science
I’ve been mainly working on public engagement and outreach. I think these are very meaningful activity that let the public to know about synthetic biology, because I was one of the people who don’t even heard of synthetic biology. As one of the member of iGEM team, Korea_U_Seoul, it is great experience for me to open the new world-synthetic biology- and meet good members of our team.

Team
The team consists of students from different grades of bachelor’s degree, armed with varied but complementary expertise. It was founded in winter of year 2015, 3 months after which the general topic of this project (a new treatment for cancer) was determined through the process of brainstorming, article reading and debating. Then questionnaires had been sent out to get public expectation for cancer treatment. Under the guidance of Prof. Xi Chen and Prof. Chenyu Zhang, and based on survey results and deeper understanding of related research articles, the ultimate idea was established on March of 2016.
person_pinChenhui Deng
Chenhui Deng is one of the two who in charge of all the qPCR experiments in both in vivo and in vitro validation of iRGD-siRNA-exosome function. It was him who pointed out that we should referred to the view from public (both general one and patients) to value if our idea did have its practical significance. He will represent the whole team to present our project at the final Jamboree.
person_pinJingyi Chen
Jingyi Chen learned cell proliferation assay and endotoxin detecting assay from our advisors, two graduate students in Prof. Xi Chen’s lab, to ascertain iRGD-siRNA-exosome can suppress cancer cells’ proliferation and to prove our drug system is nontoxic for normal cells, respectively. In human practice, she accompany with Jiaxin Cai to deeply interview the doctor from a local hospital. Also, she will present our project at the final Jamboree together with Chenhui Deng.
person_pinXiaoyang Gu
Xiaoyang Gu is the master of western blot, conducting all the experiments that proved significant decrease of our target gene (KRAS) in the protein level after treated with iRGD-siRNA-exosomes. During this process, she learned transmission electron microscope assay (TEM) from a graduate student in Prof. Xi Chen’s lab, to ensure we get exosomes after collection assay according to the morphology of the harvest, and also determine exosomes’ density.
person_pinYingzi Chai
Yingzi Chai is responsible for our BioBricks construction and has persistently performed cloning for genes of shRNA and iRGD-Lamp2b fusion protein. She did qPCR experiments for siRNA’s silencing validation in vivo and in vitro together with Chenhui Deng. Besides, she is the third person who will present our work at the Giant Jamboree.
person_pinYue Peng
Yue Peng learned animal model and cell culture from graduate students and designed our non-small cell lung cancer mouse models. In addition, she was the babysitter of both our chassis cells and cancer cells, setting the basis of all the in vivo and in vitro experiments. And after we got our questionnaires back from both general public and cancer patients, she did the analysis and made conclusion from the survey.
person_pinZining Yang
Zining Yang learned animal surgery from graduate students, conducting both intravenous exosome injection and lung tumor harvest and measurement. Her work proved our drug system could truly have effects on tumor cells in vivo. Moreover, she designed our questionnaires for general public, to get their cognition of cancer and its related treatment.

iGEM Crowd Funding, August 2016
In an attempt to improve the status of our cash flow, a crowdfunding program was put into action in August 2016, lasting a one-week period. The program was issued on an online platform in Beijing. In informative overview of the project and an introduction of the competition were produced. Well- organised repaying scheme was drawn whereas gifts represented by team postcards, T-shirts and sequencing service were emailed to donors in a gesture of gratitude. Just on the second day, a surprising amount of finance, 19,000 RMB were collected, an equivalence of $2,819, meeting the goal. The support from the wide range of individuals represented by friends, families teachers and schoolmates of the team members reflected, to an extent of significance, the public awareness built up by our endeavours of human practice over the months.

Hi, I am Xiong Yinyu. You can also call me Flame, which is my English name. I must note that it is my first time to take part in iGem. Even though I am good in my biology studying, it quite surprisesme by this competition. After then, I know more about the real scientific research.
In our team, I usually work for designing primer and plasmids as well as making these plasmids. I don't think I did it well this time. However, next year will be better!
The optimistic and hard work character pump me to continue to work in the iGem competition after facing much more faults.
Absolutely, I love it and will join iGem again in the future.

The CLS iGEM team started this year on an uphill struggle. To enter a competition of this magnitude is an impressive feat for any high school, let alone one that is entering for the first time and with minimal help from any Universities. We were told countless times to wait till we go to University to enter, or to spend this year raising funds and to enter next year. However, thanks to the generosity of the School and in particularly to Sarah Fletcher the Head, we raised enough money to enter 4 boys and the PI to Jamboree although every boy has done enough to merit a place. We have completed the vast majority of our lab work without any outside help, and we are thankful to Imperial for lending a helping hand when, and only when, required. We are in the unusual position of being in a boys only team, simply because CLS is a Boy’s School. However the fact that our team is comprised from only one school, unlike many of our competitors, has proved advantageous. We are able to meet up at incredibly short notice and we have gone through the inevitable ups and downs of microbiology as a coherent unit. The smaller number of people in the pool to choose from forced us to look beyond Biology as the primary skillset of useful Team members, and the resulting montage of skillsets in our team has allowed us to reach such heights.

Team
Clemens von Stengel
Clemens is the team’s creative dynamo and leader. It was his idea to enter iGEM in the first place and his interest in synthetic biology runs deepest – he has attended numerous conferences and interned at CyBio and LabGenius over the summer. He is involved in most of the team’s activities to some degree or another and has contributed to everything from research to experimental design. Our beautiful wiki is largely his work. Outside of biology, his scientific interests range from logic gates, carbon nanotubes and artificial intelligence to the more esoteric corners of mathematics.
Jake Mendel
Jake is a jack-of-all-trades (and master of most). He is a physicist, biologist, chemist and mathematician who provides much of the team’s intellectual heft. Research is his natural forte but he is also surprisingly good at badgering potential sponsors and collaborators. He particularly enjoys arguing with Clemens over fairly minor points of detail, usually at length and always at the top of his voice.
James Ng
James is the team’s head of human practices, a position to which he is ideally suited as a prospective lawyer. He is a fine writer and has written several articles and pamphlets for the team. Sadly, he is not continuing with biology beyond this year – iGEM is something of a swan-song for him.
Cameron Anderson
Cameron has his fingers in many pies. Over the past few months, he has contributed to the team’s research, carried out numerous experiments and searched high and low for potential sponsors. Moreover, he has written a couple of articles explaining the principles of synthetic biology in layman’s terms – something that, as many will appreciate, is easier said than done. He will be an attaché to the team’s iGEM delegation in October.
Frederick-Tyler MacBruce
Freddie is one of the team’s pipette-wielding experimentalists. He is usually one of the people who carries out mini-prep isolation, restriction digests, ligation and purification. Outside of iGEM, he sings, acts and plays about twenty different sports. Nobody quite knows how he manages to find the time to help out with iGEM given this dizzying array of other interests.
Elias Manuelides
Elias is both an artist and a scientist. He’s responsible for most of the arty stuff – most of the works of art on this wiki are his. However, he has also been involved in many of the team’s experiments and his skill with a pipette is equal to his skill with a pencil or paintbrush.
Jake Hung
Jake is the sort of person that every team needs. He is always on hand and always on time, ready to help whenever necessary. He’s been involved in most of our experiments and has devoted numerous early mornings to iGEM. Above and beyond biology, he plays chess rather well and is a fine footballer (if somewhat over-aggressive at times).
Naail Kashif-Khan
Naail has been one of the team’s most active members. He has diligently researched a broad variety of topics ranging from plasmids to natural transformation but has also found the time to help out in the lab. He can also speak decent Russian.
Gulzar Uddin
Gulzar is one of the team’s quieter, calmer, saner members. A would-be medic, he is a capable scientist and a diligent researcher. When doing experiments, he can often be found tucked away in the corner of the lab, quietly carrying out whatever needs doing whilst everybody else discusses how to do it.
Michael O'Connor
Michael wrote these brief biographies. Any views expressed on this page are solely his own. Amusingly, he will (probably) be studying history this time next year and will likely have completely forgotten the difference between a centrosome and a centromere. Editor's Note: Michael is a humble man, and this entry far understates the work he has done for the team. Many thanks for the countless times he has stayed up late to work out the folding of primers or to write an article.
Adam Zivanic
Mr Zivanic is the team’s eminence grise. Backstage, he has been the driving force behind our project – organizing, questioning, chastising, coordinating and explaining. As our PI, he has taught us almost everything that we know about synthetic biology. His meticulous attention to detail – which at times borders on pedantry – has been a real asset. He is not the sort of person who mislabels Eppendorf tubes or leaves species names uncapitalized. Without his help, the project would not have made it off the ground.
Many thanks to Charlie Stuart from our school for taking these photos!"

As a High School team, the only elements of Synthetic Biology we studied before starting iGEM were the basics of protein synthesis as part of our Biology Course. So, in order to prepare for the work ahead of us we had to spend a few weeks of intensive studying and learning the basics of the molecular techniques we were going to use. One of our aims this year has been to set up a model that would allow the future teams from our school to take part in iGEM without needing significant help from any other institution, which is why we aimed to work as independently as possible using our own labs.
Textbooks we used at the earliest stage to research gene expression and basic techniques of Synthetic Biology:
Lewin, B. (2014). Genes XI. Burlington: Jones & Bartlett Learning
Freemont, P.S. et al (2012). Synthetic Biology - A Primer. London: Imperial College Press
Anthony, C. et al (2014). Synthetic Biology: A Lab Manual. Lndon: World Scientific
As a result of this we spent the first month brainstorming ideas and learning the theory behind what we were about to do. Our PI taught us the basic techniques involved and discussed cloning strategies with us. Our initial lab work consisted of learning the techniques that we were going to apply to our project.
General Support
Sara White, Senior Biology Technician at our school taught us necessary microbiological techniques and the ways of working in sterile environment - everything from autoclaving media and waste to different plating techniques. She contributed greatly to the success of the project. Our PI taught us molecular biology techniques  - anything from using Gilson pipettes to making and running the gels and programming PCR thermocycler.
Project support and advice
We discussed all aspects of our project with out PI. Methods specific to working with Synechocystis PCC6803 were discussed with Paulina Bartasun and John Rowland of Imperial College, who also gave us the E. coli glycerol stock from which we miniprepped the pDF-lac plasmid to use in our transformations. Imperial iGEM team checked through our cloning strategies and advised us early on to try and go standard assembly rather than 3A assembly.
Fundraising help and advice
We did all the fundraising on our own, although we are extremely grateful to Mrs S. Fletcher, the Head of our school for helping fund our project when we fell short of our target.
Lab support
All the work we carried out in our school lab. In order to do this we needed to notify the Health and Safety Executive of the Contained Use of Premises for GMO work, for which we needed expert consultants. We are thankful to Kirsten Jensen and Karen Polizzi of the Imperial College for reading through our risk assessments and safety policy and acting as the points of contact for HSE.   We are also grateful to the Senior Management Team of our school for allowing us to do some lab work over the summer while the refurbishment of the building was taking place. At times, working with the construction crew around us was interesting, not the least when the fire alarm was set of in the middle of our minipreps.
Difficult technique support
Our main references for all the techniques were the instructions from the kits suppliers and OpenWetWare.org. When facing a problem in our work we turned to OpenWetWare and users' comments on there and tried to solve everything by trying out different things. This was best exemplified when we spent three weeks working out why our minipreps weren't working. When everything else failed, we turned to Imperial College Team for their help and advice. In this particular instance they tested our samples and worked out that our gel stain was not sensitive enough and pointed us in the direction of the one they were using.
Project advisor support
We discussed all our cloning strategies with our PI and he advised us on the changes we needed to make. Much of our work was informed from Anthony, C. et al. Our PI also taught us all the experimental techniques we used and safety procedures.
Wiki support
This was solely the domain of our Student Leader, Clemens, who did most of the work and guided us through the rest. Thanks to Elias for his amazing charcoal drawings, which Clemens then digitised and implemented on to the wiki. Clemens even managed to get Mr Zivanic (our PI) to do lots of copying and pasting of code throughout different parts of our Wiki. He reliably informs us that his favourite task was italicising Latin names.
Presentation coaching
We are grateful to Imperial College for allowing us to practice our presentation with them. We are also grateful to Tom Kelly from our school for helping us print our poster.
Human Practices support
James was completely responsible for researching human practices aspects of the projects. We are thankful for the members of the public who were willing to talk to us during our open event and who agreed to pose for some photos with us, as well as the younger pupils who helped to test our board game. We also give our thanks to the City of London School Citizen Team for editing our articles for their newspaper.
Thanks and acknowledgements for all other people involved in helping make a successful iGEM team
Our sincere thanks go to the Biology Department at our school who sustained our hectic working schedules. As most of our work had to be done from September onwards due to summer works in the building, we had to fit all the lab work around our free time during school day, which meant random access to labs and the prep room."

Macquarie University
The 2016 Macquarie University iGEM would like to thank Macquarie University as a whole, as well as all of our advisors and supporters from the Department of Chemistry and Biomolecular Sciences (CBMS) who have provided us with laboratory space, materials and our amazing technician. We would also like to thank the Macquarie University iGEM teams from 2013 through to 2015 for all that they have contributed to this project;
2013 Macquarie Australia:
Designed and built single gene parts of the Chlorophyll biosynthesis pathway
Characterized ChlD and Plastocyanin
2014 Macquarie Australia:
Built composite parts for the Chlorophyll biosynthesis pathway
Repaired the ChlD (missing 50bp, but still functional)
Characterized ChlI1 and ChlD (new) with purified ChlH from Prof. Willow’s group
Characterized GUN4 binding of PPIX
2015 Macquarie Australia:
Designed and built single gene parts (small composite parts) of Photosystem II
Built ChlH biobrick
Characterized ChlM
Improved the characterization of ChlD
Modelled the PPIX production from ALA
Modelled the production of hydrogen gas by photosystem II/hydrogenase combination
We have expanded on that work this year by furthering the chlorophyll biosynthesis pathway and photosystem II assembly as well as adding the hydrogenase pathway.
Students
We had a large cohort this year who were divided between eight main teams. These teams included; The Chlorophyll Biosynthesis Team, who worked on constructing the ‘super operon’ and ‘mega operon’ and succeeded with proving function of the super operon; The Photosystem II Team, who worked tirelessly in the lab, ligating together parts to make up the five operons of photosystem II and then operons; The Hydrogenase Team, who have been working on designing and constructing biobrick parts for the hydrogenase pathway in our system; The Modelling Team, who modelled the chlorophyll production from ALA as well as building on last year’s model of protoporphyrin IX in a hemH mutant of E. coli; The Interlab Team, who worked with remarkable efficiency to provide results to iGEM to contribute to the international lab study (only 5 weeks after our team formed!); The Human Practices team, who organised not only our public outreach activities, but also all communications with Australian farmers and our integration practices; The lab support team, who provided the 4 lab teams with endless supplies of agar plates, gels, LB media, buffers and enthusiasm; and finally, the Wiki Team, without whom we would have no documentation of our results. We would like to give a special thanks to Aashray, Manruka and Prabhjot who have devoted countless hours to editing, coding and photo shopping the various write ups and diagrams for our wiki.
Instructors and Advisors
Our team would like to say a special thanks to our instructors and advisors:
Dr. Louise Brown for her constant guidance in the laboratory and her input towards all areas of our project.

Biosafety :
Damien took care to complete the Safety Forms.
Informatics and wiki support:
Alexandre Mattenet who built our wiki from a to z.
Lab Work:
Due to the hard work required to take care of several mutants libraries and to go through our diverse selection methods, most of the team took part in the lab work. But beyond the daily work we can highlight the work of Adrien Gauchet who designed a protocol to extract maltodextrins from glycose syrup; Antoine Godeaux, Joaquin Guzman and Meredith Wouters who, relying on their lab’s experience, trained the rest of the team; François Tyckaert and Maxime Velings who realized most of the sequencings.
Maltodextrin production:
Purified maltodextrins, is a substrate needed in large quantities during our selection process. It is a key component for our project, difficult to obtain and which prices can rise to 1500 €/gr. Thanks to Cargill who delivered free corn glucose syrup, we were able to extract from it the wanted maltodextrins fractions following a protocol adapted from an article and designed by Adrien Gauchet.

Introduction of our team members, instructors and advisors
Michelle Ammann
Just finished my second year of a BSc in Biochemical Engineering and Business Management                                 and am enjoying life in London. Really into entrepreneurship and everything creative but                                 also enjoy the occasional visit to the lab. I have a talent of pushing people's buttons                                 and using that to my own entertainment. Love yoga, pilates, matcha lattes and GMO                                 cheeseballs. Master of iGEM rules and Deadlines and life in general. #hashtag
Amandeep Varia
Being one of the youngest members of the iGEM team, I’m the perfect guinea pig for our healthy ageing project! Currently in my second year of a Biochemical engineering MEng                                 degree and I love looking for new challenges, being inspired by synthetic biology and                                 popcorn filled movie nights. I wanted a summer packed full of fun, blood, sweat and                                 tears and and iGEM fits the job perfectly!
Abbie Rogan
I am a 4th year Biochemistry (MSci) student obsessed with antibodies, ageing and                                 antibiotic resistance. Synthetic biology for me is a creative science and can be most                                 powerful when combined with other fields like architecture, art or computer science. In                                 iGEM I experiment in the lab and tell the world about it whether that is documenting our                                 progress on social media or giving talks to students and the public. Aside from this I                                 enjoy meeting and interacting with new people - whether that’s other iGEM teams or the                                 public. Thus I hope to be able to bring the two together through organising events to                                 engage everyone with synthetic biology! I am the early riser of the team and love waking                                 up to sunrises. When not iGEM-ing you will see me dancing (or trying to), exploring new                                 places and working as a student ambassador at UCL or shamelessly selling subscriptions                                 to The Economist.
Dale Stibbs
I’m a second year Biochemical Engineering student. My interest in synthetic biology stems from is it’s vast range of applications to solve real world problems. Hoping to spend the summer experimenting in the lab and striving towards HTML competency.
Jakub Domaradski
Third year Biochemical Engineering student. My interest in synthetic biology stems from its unlimited potential for improvement.  I hope to bring my lab experience into our iGEM team, along with some modelling and automation knowledge. Since I am keen on industrial bioprocessing, I am also going to work on the industrial aspects of our project, such as scale-up.
As for my non-biotech related interest, they range, among others, from economics to jazz music and cooking.
Neythen Treolar
Just finished second year Natural Sciences, studying Physics and Molecular and Cell Biology. Synthetic biology appeals to me as a way to build complex systems from the bottom up and extend the function of natural organisms for our benefit. I have an interest in technology and hope to bring my self taught programming skills into our project.
Yuqiao Liu
I come from Beijing. I love Science but my passion in science is presented in terms of philosophy. It is an amazing opportunity to be involved in iGEM within the UCL team as I'm working with people from different backgrounds. Orchestra, Opera, ballet and photography are my non-academic life and I enjoy cooking as well. Things change fast at my age.
Hana Janebdar
Finishing up my Masters in Biochemical Engineering, I’m keen to delve into the synbio startup world! I love all things ageing and will be working on the entrepreneurial aspects of our project this year. My biggest weakness is keeping a straight face with this crazy team! When I’m not busy with iGEM, I like to spend my time thinking up reasons for not going to the gym.
Kamil Zmijewski
I just finished my second year of the cell and molecular biology stream within the Biomedical Sciences BSc degree program at UCL. I am intrigued by the multilevel complexity of living systems and how the understanding of their characteristics translates to the possibility to prolong human life and improve its quality. Consequently, my primary interest lies in the scientific basis of our project. I plan to pursue a science-based career and I hope that it will be, taking into account challenges associated with this type of work, a rewarding path with hopefully relevant consequences.
Chinyere Ihuegbu
Aging is an inevitable part of life, ask Dorian Gray…. My name is Chinyere Ihuegbu (Chichi). I am finishing up my Masters in Biosciences. I enjoy research in life sciences,and interesting and engaging activities. In my spare time, I could be found learning the violin. I addition to science, I also enjoy working with kids and promoting education.
Student Consultants
Jesus Miguens Blanco
I am an MRes Synthetic Biology student, so joining the UCL iGEM team made sense, do not worry, there is not much sense left in my life.  Among my uncountable passions are colourful socks, good spoons and maps.  iGEM is one of them too, as it is the best chance to show, beyond a bunch of proud freaks, what Synthetic Biology is about, and at the same time participate in an ambitious and responsible project. Our amazing project is about aging and wellbeing, or how to stop the first and extend the later. Aging is a fascinating topic for me since my younger years; I used to punch the wall of my bedroom as a kid because I did not tolerate death as an unavoidable thing.  Maybe my approach has changed but not the energy. As a kid and even today I would never give a glance to a map of the world that does not include Utopia.
Enrique de Zamacona Meza
Full time MRes Synthetic Biology student and entrepreneur. Science and Technology are part of my life passions, alongside arts, films, martial arts, learning languages and travelling (There are too many, I know). Also, I truly believe that synthetic biology is dramatically changing how people will live their lives, and this particular project is proof of that. By tackling the downwards of senescence at molecular level, this team is setting the pace for new thing to come in iGEM, just as biosensors did in the early competitions. I never heard about iGEM until my final year of undergrad, and by that time I couldn’t join my school’s team. Now, I am proud of being part of the UCL iGEM team as an advisor and help this team in this project and I have to say that this team are amazing.

Doctoral Advisors
Kasia Kozdon
I am currently undertaking the second year of my PhD in Interdisciplinary Biosciences. As a member of The Intelligent Systems Group at the UCL Department of Computer Science, I am working at the intersection of neuroscience and artificial intelligence. I am also a doctoral advisor to the UCL iGEM 2016 team.
Luba Prout
I am in my second year of the BBSRC London Interdisciplinary Doctoral programme at the Department of Biochemical Engineering, UCL, working on the characterisation of a natural enzyme fusion as well as novel enzyme engineering. I am a bit of an iGEM veteran, having competed in the competition as a Birkbeck team leader in 2015, and now acting as a doctoral adviser to the UCL iGEM 2016 team. Synthetic Biology is an exciting field to be in.

This page is used by the judges to evaluate your team for the Attributions bronze criterion .
Delete this box in order to be evaluated for this medal. See more information at Instructions for Pages for awards .
Each team must clearly attribute work done by the student team members on this page. The team must distinguish work done by the students from work done by others, including the host labs, advisors, instructors, and individuals not on the team roster.
Why is this page needed?
The Attribution requirement helps the judges know what you did yourselves and what you had help with. We don't mind if you get help with difficult or complex techniques, but you must report what work your team did and what work was done by others.
For example, you might choose to work with an animal model during your project. Working with animals requires getting a license and applying far in advance to conduct certain experiments in many countries. This is difficult to achieve during the course of a summer, but much easier if you can work with a postdoc or PI who has the right licenses.
What should this page have?

Thanks and acknowledgements for all other people involved in helping make a successful iGEM team
Can we base our project on a previous one?
Yes! You can have a project based on a previous team, or based on someone else's idea, as long as you state this fact very clearly and give credit for the original project.

Kamil
I just finished my second year of the cell and molecular biology stream within the Biomedical Sciences BSc degree program at UCL. I am intrigued by the multilevel complexity of living systems and how the understanding of their characteristics translates to the possibility to prolong human life and improve its quality. Consequently, my primary interest lies in the scientific basis of our project. I plan to pursue a science-based career and I hope that it will be, taking into account challenges associated with this type of work, a rewarding path with hopefully relevant consequences.
Michal
Contrary to popular belief, studying Arts and Sciences does not mean that I’m drawing human bodies. Focusing mainly on science communication, my role in the team is to primarily put our topic into a wider context of the society. Having just finished my second year, I am keen on putting into practice what I have learned over the past few months. Besides studying, I am an avid reader of anything that was words, but most of the time I emerge myself in sci-fi or fantasy genre, which explains my addiction to manga. I also really enjoy playing sports, having run Floorball Club at UCL throughout the year.
Chineyere
Aging is an inevitable part of life, ask Dorian Gray…. My name is Chinyere Ihuegbu (Chichi). I am finishing up my Masters in Biosciences. I enjoy life sciences, smiles and all things fun. When not in a lab coat, I try to learn the violin. I addition to science, I enjoy working with kids.

I am an MRes Synthetic Biology student, so joining the UCL iGEM team made sense, do not worry, there is not much sense left in my life.  Among my uncountable passions are colourful socks, good spoons and maps.  iGEM is one of them too, as it is the best chance to show, beyond a bunch of proud freaks, what Synthetic Biology is about, and at the same time participate in an ambitious and responsible project. Our amazing project is about aging and wellbeing, or how to stop the first and extend the later. Aging is a fascinating topic for me since my younger years; I used to punch the wall of my bedroom as a kid because I did not tolerate death as an unavoidable thing.  Maybe my approach has changed but not the energy. As a kid and even today I would never give a glance to a map of the world that does not include Utopia.
Enrique
Full time MRes Synthetic Biology student and entrepreneur. Science and Technology are part of my life passions, alongside arts, films, martial arts, learning languages and travelling (There are too many, I know). Also, I truly believe that synthetic biology is dramatically changing how people will live their lives, and this particular project is proof of that. By tackling the downwards of senescence at molecular level, this team is setting the pace for new thing to come in iGEM, just as biosensors did in the early competitions. I never heard about iGEM until my final year of undergrad, and by that time I couldn’t join my school’s team. Now, I am proud of being part of the UCL iGEM team as an advisor and help this team in this project and I have to say that this team are amazing.

The 2016 UCLouvain iGEM Team is composed of twelve students from our bioengineering, engineering and biology schools and two biology professors. Come and meet the team ...
Adrien Gauchet :
Adrien is a master student in bioengineering in chemical and bio-industry. In his field, he loves everything about catalysis systems and chemical reactions. Then, he’s certainly our chemist (our own Heisenberg) and our glucose syrup master (show him some respect). Thanks to him we have had the opportunity to grow our bacteria on a homemade media. Adrien will also be our GO (literally “Gentil Organisateur” = Nice Organizer) for our trip to Boston. By the way, he’s the french one of the team but certainly the most belgian of all the french expatriates. He would certainly be the one to come at our team’s meeting a bit tipsy.
Adrien in one song ? Surely, “Quand l’appétit va, tout va !” (Astérix et Obélix, Mission Cléopâtre)
Alexandre Mattenet :
Alexandre is a master student in civil engineering in computer science. His task in the Team is the wiki support! He has an incredible sense of design. Listening and playing some music with nothing else than a GameBoy and drawing at any time, this guy does real ART. For him the answer will always be 42.
Alex in one song ? Surely, ‘Nyan Cat’ (Tosh 8.0)
Antoine Godeaux :
Aaaah, the God!! Antoine is a master student in biology, but he’s our god. When he speaks everyone listens. For every situation he will give you some wonderful punchlines such as “We all make mistakes” or “Trust no one”. He likes when everything is straight and right. The God has a lot of experience in biology and he has huge ambitions for his future. He’s the one that makes a Skype for an internship on the other side of the globe while making some experiments in the lab at the same time.
Antoine in one song? Surely, “Downtown” (Mackelmore and Ryan Lewis).
Benjamin Devreux :
Benjamin is a master student in bioengineering in chemical and bio-industry. To put it simply, Benjamin will always disagree with you. Why ? Just to bother you, of course. He loves to grumble on everyone and about everything. But in reality when he makes something, he makes it right. For iGEM, he’s ready to make more than 150 petri dishes to make you happy. And thanks to him, we can explain our project to everyone with a simple but efficient video.
Benjamin in one song ? Surely, “Beat it” (Michael Jackson).
Damien Fivet :
Damien is a master student in bioengineering. Damien is clearly the father of the team. During hard moment, he’s the one that you send to negotiate with your opponent. He’s always calm and peaceful. Furthermore, Damien is the one who has a calendar in his hands, reminding you all the things to do and when. Without him, we would never have done anything in a timely manner.
Damien in one song ? Surely, “Hold that tiger” (The swing ninjas).
François Tyckaert :
François is a master student in biology. He is our DNA sequencing expert. He is also the redhead of the team (well, one of them). He has plenty of explanations for your lab’s problems… Maybe too much but never mind that, it’s often quite useful for the rest of the team.
François in one song? Surely, “Bare necessities” (The Jungle Book)
Grégory Godefroi :
Grégory is a master student in bioengineering. To describe him in few words, he is a hard worker. Ready to work a lot, at all time of the day or night. He’s also a true master in chemical physics field, or maybe not. Ask him, you’ll see. Grégory was also the guy who forced us to go outside (not for pleasure or to enjoy the sun, just to catch some pokemons ;) ).
Grégory in one song ? Surely, “Gotta catch em all” (Pokémon)
Joaquin Guzman :
Joaquin is a master student in biology. For us it’s Armando. He is the master of the lab… Well mostly during the afternoon, he is not a morning person ;). However, Joaquin will always be the guy with an answer to your question. He loves to explain everything, even the things that you already know. In a way, he’s the memory of the team.
Joaquin in one song? Surely, “Livin la Vida Loca” (Ricky Martin)
Kilian Dekoninck :
Kilian (or Kiki or Ki²) is a master student in bioengineering in chemical and bio-industry. He may be our team leader but for everyone he is the Texan guy of the team. You’ll better not expect to see Kiki outside of the lab even if he says he will come to have a drink. He is rarely in a bad mood, but when he is, you better not bother him. He made a wonderful job managing the team. He has impressive communication skills and brought us a lot of sponsorship with his huge address book.
Kiki in one song? “Like A Boss” (The Lonely Island)
Maxime Velings :
Maxime is a master student in bioengineering. Learning and gaining some experience in all the fields of the project, he found his way both in lab work and in social media. Always listening to some advices, he does his best to make sure that all things are all right … except at catching pokemon (need some iOS system upgrade ! :( )
One song for Max? Surely, “Viva la vida” (Coldplay)
Meredith Wouters :
Meredith is a master student in biology. Meredith makes her master thesis in the lab where we work. First, she was just curious about our project but finally she decided to join the team. She brings a lot of her molecular biologist’s formation to the project. Many times, she gave us some clues to move forward in our project. She’s essential to the team. Furthermore, she became the mother of the team...Well it’s simple, she’s the only “she” of the team, she had no choice.
Meredith in one song? Surely, “This girl is on fire” (Alicia Keys)
Pierre-Antoine Masscheleyn :
Pierre-Antoine or just PA (it’s easier) is a master student in bioengineering. He joined the project while he was in exchange program in Helsinki. What he likes to do in the lab is to remind you of all the basic biosafety procedures. His favorite game is telling you when your hands are no more sterile. PA is the kind of person who can participate in multiple projects (like iGEM) at the same time, he just likes to have a lot on his plate.
PA in one song? Surely, “I will wait” (Mumford and sons)
Prof. Bernard Hallet :
Bernard is one of the PI of the BBGM lab in Louvain-La-Neuve (Biochemistry, Biophysics and Genetics of Microorganisms). His work focusses on molecular mechanisms of DNA transposition and site-specific recombination.
Formation:
Master degree in Biology at UCL and PhD in bacterial genetics at UCL (Biology Dpt, Prof. J. Delcour). Postdoctoral training at the University of Oxford, UK (Biochemistry Dpt, Prof. D.J. Sherratt). Research associate at the FNRS, Lecturer at UCL since 2001.
Fields of expertise:

Megan Satyadi | Junior | Microbiology, Immunology, and Molecular Genetics
I am a junior in MIMG and am returning for a third year as a research advisor and Director of Training. Additionally, I am also an undergraduate research associate in the Kosuri Lab at UCLA studying GPCR-ligand interactions and developing a multiplex assay to deorphanize the entirety of the human and mouse olfactory receptor repertoire. I believe synthetic biology holds infinite power and potential to revolutionize science, and is the perfect outlet for innovative scientific minds. Long term, I plan on pursuing a MD and entering the field of gastroenterological surgery. When I'm not stuck working in a TC hood, I'm an avid reader and enjoy working with animals.
Alan Chen | Junior | Neuroscience
​I am a junior undergraduate just joining iGEM this year and am currently majoring in Neuroscience at UCLA. I have always been interested in synthetic biology and find it fascinating to reprogram existing biological systems. Currently I am working with a group to create a bacterial toxin delivery system.
Amy Guo | Sophomore | Bioengineering
I am currently a sophomore bioengineering student. My interests include botany, particularly plant-herbivore interactions and plant-to-plant communication pathways, and diatoms. Synthetic biology I feel is best described as a pair of much-needed, high-prescription glasses-- your perception of the world around you becomes wonderfully magnified and crisp, and suddenly you are able to view the mechanics of living organisms as an infinite library of blueprints at your disposal.
Omar Ebrahim | Sophomore | Biochemistry
Innovation has never been the product of book smarts alone. For an idea to bear fruit, I believe one has to tinker with it. Unfortunately, much of a biologist's education consists of almost exclusively memorization and recitation of facts. However, synthetic biology is somewhat of an anomaly because it embodies the practice of picking something apart and manipulating it's core components as its standard methodology. I guess that's why I am here.
Andrew Liu | Junior | Biochemistry
I am a 3rd year biochemistry major here at UCLA, and it is my first year on the iGEM team. I love everything science and so the interdisciplinary and undergraduate guided research in iGEM is an incredibly enjoyable experience for me!
Scott Taylor | Junior | Microbiology, Immunology, and Molecular Genetics
As a junior in the MIMG Department (for now), I’m am a new addition to the iGEM team. My previous lab experience has been working on data analysis and correlation of production of certain yeast metabolites. In the coming year, I am eager to explore synthetic biology, which I sees as a very open frontier for interesting, novel ideas to be explored. As for my long term goals, it’s all up in the air.
Amy Pai | Sophomore | Neuroscience
Initially, I was pleasantly surprised that there would be a research team genuinely valuing input from first-years like me. UCLA iGEM not only offers the platform for individual voice in developing a project, but also opens the door to many aspects of research dynamics. Syn bio wields massive potentials for creative minds, and it’s remarkable that we get to explore the field this way.
Nithin Dharmaraj | Junior | Bioengineering
I am a junior study bioengineering. I enjoy the creativity and autonomy that iGEM provides and also cherish the opportunity to work with some of the brightest minds at my university. Though most of my transformations rarely work, I still marvel at the power of synthetic biology when in the off chance I do see colonies on my plate. With this same excitement, I hope to pursue a profession in advancing the field of healthcare in the future.
Yashes Srinivasan | Sophomore | Bioengineering
Passionate about science and innovation, I am excited to be part of UCLA iGEM. The program offers more than just a research experience. It encourages independence and creativity and allows students to explore unique interests alongside a dynamic and driven group of individuals. The interdisciplinary nature of synthetic biology provides several opportunities as well as exposure to many different fields of science.
Jared Lamar | Junior | Physics
​I am a junior undergraduate majoring in Physics at UCLA. This is my second year on the team. What I'm most drawn to about iGEM and synthetic biology is the sheer number of possibilities there are in terms of the directions our research can take. It really feels like the sky is the limit as to what we can make these little microbes do."

Our Team
SCU-China is founded in 2012,with the support of the College of Life Science of Sichuan University.The team exists as a scholar club in the university and it really provides a platform for all students to show their passions and potentials.Some guys have been working in the team for a few years,making the whole team really a big family.
This year,we get students from ten different colleges and it gives us the chances to know different majors and work together.We really enjoy the time and it leaves such a deep impression on everyone who contributes here.We design all our projects independently by ourselves.
Though we haven't got any gold medal as far,we gained a lot from the process.We really enjoy the iGEM competition.
This year, we shot a video in our campus called “Ordinary E. coli” to show our team spirit and attract others’ attention to our project. And we got the copyrights from the original song writer “iLem” on Sina Weibo to cover the original song “Ordinary Disco”, which is quite famous in China. Check this out!

This is the third year for me to be an iGEMer. Honestly, iGEM plays a critical role during my college years. From a team member for last two years, to the team leader (the group leader of CecropinXJ expression group as well) for this year, I have learnt too much from iGEM. Personally speaking, iGEM is a fantastic platform for college students to learn what is real research, and how to collaborate with others in lab environment. My passion towards research will be continued even after I've become a former iGEMer.

It's the second year for me to join the iGEM competition. It's surprised that I became the co-leader of the team as a Grade 2 student then and the project designer this year. I'm responsible for the VHb gene in experiment part. I really appreciate the recognization of me. I want to thank all the team members. It's you guys who company me through the whole year. The experience of working together for one goal will become an important part of my student life forever. And I've decided to enter a synthetic biology lab to study further in this field.

This is the second year for me to participate in the iGEM. In retrospect of last year, I have learned rudimentary molecular experiment skills from our precedents. During this year, I get myself familiar with other advanced skills such as Gibson Assembly, OE OCR and qPCR. I believe that the headquarter of iGEM gives us a scope to image our own biology machine freedomly although for a short while.  At last, I would like to appreciate Miss. LUO as a crucial precedent to guide me into this interesting molecular biology realm.

I may have passed one thousand days with iGEM. At the beginning, I learned basic knowledge of biology and tried to do some easy experiment. After one year, reading paper and knowing the principle of experiment became important. Now I'm helping freshmen, designing the experiment of expressing AarC and let it come true. There are so much reminiscence and  growth during the time in iGEM, which are the most precious wealth.

This is the second year for me to be an iGEMer in SCU-China. This year I do much hard work on the expression of CecropinXJ and practice a lot not only the experimental skills but also  the logical and critical thinking. To be honest, it is iGEM that makes me determined to devote myself to biological research. And fortunately, I have met the most important friends in my life in the course of the two years in our team. We are all fond of iGEM and we are going to continue working for it.

This  is the first year for me to be an iGEMer. I joined it as soon as I came to my college because I really like it where I can have a good method and skill in the experiment. What's more, I enjoy the atmosphere when we cooperate with each other by means of group discussion, seminars and doing experiment together. Honestly speaking, I  learned a lot in this year and am planning to go further and deeper in this interesting area.

It's my first time to take part in the iGEM. In summer, I stay in the lab for a month. I have never worked for a long time in the lab before and this is really a valuable experience in my life. I have learned how to keep everything ready so our work won't be delayed frequently. Also, I gained many interesting friends and found many delicious foods around my collage : ). To me, iGEM is an excellent chance to do our own experiments but never worry about the funds and results. Thanks to iGEM. Thanks to SCU. Thanks to the Lifescience school.

Undeniably, when it comes to the most unique experience I have gained as a freshman, the time I spend on iGEM should be mentioned. Worked in acetate metabolism and human practice groups, I'm glad to acquire so much synthetic biology knowledge, experiment skills from responsible seniors, and get used to teamwork. iGEM provides us with an excellent stage to design, demonstrate, and present the project, which deeply attracts me. When we design the project with inspirations and creativity, the synthetic biology is definitely brought to life.

It's my honour to become an iGEMer as a freshman in SCU. Not only do I improve my experimental skills,but also make new friends and really get fun. The comprehensive help given by senior, the cheer with partners in human practice and the felling of designing something now--these are what I love that attract me. And I wish I will always keep my passion going along this road.

Iris M Madsen
Iris is the project-manager behind this operation, as she is the one keeping the over-all perspective, ties up loose ends and tries to make sure everything fits together.
She is taking a bachelor in mathematics and travels the world in her spare time (and sometimes her ""not-so-much"" spare time). Somehow she still manages to be the one who's keeping track of the money and is supposebly best friends with all the university secretaries by now. Beside that, she is also the creative part of outreach, a green-lab-minion, HTML-rookie, co-writer of the upcoming article in ROOM, the meeting coordinater and possibly the most important thing - she tries to keep everyone happy and somewhat sane.
Member of the organisation team and the outreach team.
Andrea Charlie Stender Cordes
Charlie is the other half of the organization duo. She has organized two of the 3 extraordinary trips abroad, made the budget and she is responsible for this webpage, having written all code, and organised all pages. She is the one who has kept track of deadlines and requirements. She is studying for a Computer Science bachelor, and when she is not studying or working, she is playing Dungeons and Dragons with her friends.
Member of the organisation team and the funding team.
Giulia Perotti
Giulia is helping in the Red Lab, playing with the Mars Chamber when exposing the bacteria to low pressure and UV radiation. When she is not testing the behaviors of the organisms under these harsh conditions, she is writing her master thesis in astrochemistry, trying to understand the chemical evolution of star-forming regions. In her ""spare time"" she enjoys traveling the world or making the best tiramisu for the CosmoCroppers.
Member of the green lab team and the red lab team.
Nikolaj Pagh Kristensen
Nikolaj loves biomedical research of all kind, but if you show him a paper full of blots, you’re guaranteed to make him fall asleep. Comes from a background in biomedicine with a huge interest in immunology and inflammatory diseases which he hopes to cure within the next century (Yep, he’s an optimist). He primarily worked with funding, where he was the primary writer on the founding applications, which brought in about half of the founds, and working in green-lab where he has been setting up growth measurement assays, trouble-shooting and validating the results
Member of the green lab team and the funding team.
Joachim Steen Larsen
Joachim is studying for a MSc. in Biology-Biotechnology, having the BSc. in the same. He has just started his master thesis about plant-glycosylation of proteins in mammalian cells.  At CosmoCrops, Joachim is mostly involved in Green lab and Outreach. In Green lab he is doing mostly the molecular biology part, making sure that our Bacillus subtilis will be able to produce P(LA-co-3HB). This includes designing the cloning strategy, growth experiment, execution of the experiments and troubleshooting when this did not work. In Red Lab he was one of the persons designing how to measure the viability after the exposure experiment. For outreach, he has been in contact with the media and setting up events at museums and the University of Copenhagen.
Member of the green lab team and the outreach team.
Joseph Parker
Joseph Parker is studying for an MSC in Biochemistry, specialising in Molecular Genetics.  He earned a BSc in Biochemistry from the University of York in the UK.  He is mostly involved with the Green Lab, specifically assisting with several sub-groups including cloning work, growth assays, media preparation and co-culture containment, and has participated in several outreach events.
Other than iGEM and his Master thesis (elucidating lncRNA function), Joseph spends his time learning Danish, reading about alternate areas of science he can never hope to understand and watching the GBP/DKK exchange rate. He has become famous in the group, for his brilliant mix of cynicism and dry British humor.
Member of the green lab team and the outreach team.
Estahel Naseri
Stael (Estahel), the idea generator and interdisciplinary mediator within the group has stood behind the conceptual and experimental set-up within the Red Lab on acclimating bacteria to Martian conditions. In the Green Lab, she has designed the analysis processes for bacteria providen from Red Lab, followed by optimization solutions as the obstacles occurred. With this interdisciplinary mindset incorporating theoretical and practical scientific problem-solving, the Martian “super strains” have been demonstrated. Furthermore, as the primer consultant for iGEM Leiden Team on experiments at JMMC for the E. Coli strains, she has made a journal upon the results exclusive to their application. Stael has additionally helped Outreach by presenting at conferences eg. EANA, elucidating the project for media eg. MARS ONE, lastly co-authoring an article in ROOM. Personally she seeks inspiration to boost her creativity and innovation within art, natural science and especially in combined manner in order to provide scientific articles, co-working with artists to create and innovate novel products for novel application.
Member of the red lab team and the outreach team.
Thue Christian Thann Nikolajsen
Thue is studying for a B.Sc in Physics, and within the confines of this project he has made himself an expert on the Mars Chamber, carrying out modifications and repairs as well as teaching its operation procedures to others. He has also developed quite affectionate bonds with the sterile bench in the Green Lab. Outside of lab work he participated in Outreach, spreading the word to media and facilitating the cooperation with the Danish candidate in Mars One. In his free time he usually doesn't have any, and whatever is left goes towards maintaining his dry humor and exquisite sarcasm. Oh, and he usually goes by Christian in English.
Member of the red lab team and the outreach team.
Fouzia Hamid
Also called Fuzz never really understood why she chose biology field in the first place but loves every single tiny bit of a scientific conversation. She is acquiring a master degree in Biology-Biotechnology choosing cell physiology as her specialization and believes in one day the world will find cure for neurodegenerative diseases. Her innovative, intuitive and solution-oriented mind is her driving force for persistency and believe in that a problem always come along with their solution and it’s our job to pinch them out. She has been a co-presenter in 3 of 4 international conferences regarding iGEM and a co-author of an article in Room. She has been the brain behind the green lab and a left helping hand when it comes to minor details, troubleshooting and finding a bridge between the green lab and the red lab. She strongly believes in the existence of mermaids and Harry Potter world, but that’s another part of the story.
Member of the green team, the funding team AND the outreach team.
Bastian Bakkensen
Bastian is studying his B.Sc. in Physics. His primary focuses as part of CosmoCrops have been working with the Mars Chamber at the HCØ Institute and searching for funding for the project through obscure physics grants. When not working on the project, he is likely to be found at the library of the Niels Bohr Institute or walking around in Copenhagen without any particular aim.

CREATION
Thanks to the team iGEM IONIS 2015, all students from our school were aware of the iGEM competition. This year iGEM IONIS team was created as the instigation of student from Sup’Biotech.  During our first brainstorming,  we had the idea of using bioluminescence as a reporter for pollutant detection and quantification. We wanted to take advantage of the multiple schools and activity fields given by the IONIS education group. Thus, we came with the idea of realizing a new engineering systems for pollutants quantification by enclosing engineered bacteria into a drone.   The project set up, it was time for us to make the recruitment  according to the different aspects of our project. Therefore we recruited student specialized in Aeronautics for the drone conception, Computer Science for the drone control systems, the realization of our wiki and our app , in Marketing to organized the European experience and lastly in Design to realize the project's graphic design. For the first time in the history of the competition, 6 different schools  from the IONIS Education Group  met to create one team:

THE TEAM
Team creation
Thanks to the team iGEM IONIS 2015, all students from our school were aware of the iGEM competition. This year iGEM IONIS team was created as the instigation of student from Sup’Biotech.  During our first brainstorming,  we had the idea of using bioluminescence as the reporter for pollutant detection and quantification. We wanted to take advantages of the multiple schools and activity field given by the IONIS education group. Thus, we came with the idea of realizing a new engineering systems for pollutants quantification by enclosing engineered bacteria into a drone.   The project set up, it was time for us to make the recruitment  according to the different aspects of our project. Therefore we recruited student specialized in Aeronautic for the drone conception, Computer Science for the drone control sytems, the realization of our wiki and our app ,  in Marketing to organized the European experience and lastly in Design to realize the project's graphic design.
For the first time in the history of the competition, 6 different schools from the IONIS Education Group met to create one team: iGEM IONIS.

MEMBERS
Our team is made up of 9, below is a brief description of their roles, contributions to the project
Liam Carroll  
I'm a second year Bio-Med student at Warwick University and my interest in natural sciences and genomics, the mechanisms of the human body led me to believe thatthis would be the most dynamic and exciting project for me! I spend my spare time being constantly animated by pokemon, eating rice and abusing my team members.
Konstantina Koteva
I'm a fourth year Maths and Physics Student whose focus is on genetic alogorothmsfor modelling and optimisation, but my enjoyment of these fields in no way limits my passion for areas such as dancing and spending as much time as possible with my friends and family.
Hayden Tobin
As a 1st year Chemistry student Hayden is learning new and enhancing old skills byhelping in multiple aspects of the project. This ranges from working in the lab, advancing the content of the wiki and deriving some of the mathematics required for computational modelling.  He enjoys making puns and 'dad' jokes in the labs but in his spare time Hayden has a keen interest in shooting, flying and has the aim of travelling the world to see every country he can.
Chinwe Odili
I'm a second year Engineering student at Warwick Univerisity , 'to Engineer isHuman' and I thought why not delve into a field that I am completely new in and apply my technical skills , exploring modelling or even building a website in greater depth! My passions include listening to my vinyls, sketching , painting and writing.
Egheosa Ogbomo
I'm a second year Engineering student at Warwick University, I love Physics so nosurprises my role has been somewhat invested in solving equations based on the Physics of Biological Materials and looking at Modelling to some degree. Outside of the labs, I find myself fascinated in culture and exploration of archeological findings while travelling!
 Anjana Supamaniam
I'm a second year Biomed student, I thought why not be part of something thatrevolutionizes the way we think in a subject area that is a burning passion of mine functional genomics! I love to keep active whether its travelling , playing volleyball or aiming a petri dish at a team member.
Robert Richardson
I'm a third year Chemistry student , I found myself fully engaged in nearly allBiology modules on  my course by implication this seemed like a not only logical but exciting way to spend my Summer!Alongside eating salt.
 Isobel Holden
I'm a 3rd year Chemical biologist who is looking to improve my skills in wet anddry biology labs whilst gaining more experience on the human aspects of the applications of science. I am also very interested in History, Art and architecture  and I can't bear to be without Music so no silent labs when I'm around!"

Advisors
Benedikt Hölbling
It should come to no surprise that Benedikt's calm presence is but a mask for a highly reliable and motivated member of our team. With his international experience, not a single task has been unfulfilled as the boundaries of his abilities have still not been met.
 
Bùi Hoàng Duy
Duy, our member from Vietnam, is the kind of person that makes every team‘s cloning job at least a bit easier. He appears quiet and reserved, yet his wit is sharp and every time when needed he manages to point out the most important points and goals, thus making him a stabilising force in our team.
 
Niklas Arndt Schmacke
Niklas fulfills a mentor role in our team bringing people to develop their full potential. His extensive lab experience made him an ideal candidate for lab introductions for new team members and his calm presence will aid him in overcoming future problems and bringing labwork onto the right track.
Student Leaders
Sophia Mädler
Closely connected to almost every aspect of our project, Sophia is the motherboard of our team with an expertise that is applicable to the whole spectrum. Whether it comes down to the representation of our project or to conquering hunger with her baked goods, the result is always appealing. Her flexible attitude towards every task and her professional skills make her a vital building block of our team.
Team Members
Alina Siebenmorgen
Helped by her previous training experience. Beneath the cool demeanor hides her enthusiasm: Alina might not smile or talk a lot, but she's the person organising team-building activities.
 
Ariana Natalie Klappert
Ariana is our ray of sunshine. Her presence is always welcome in our laboratories and meetings. Her positive attitude makes it a pleasure to work with her and it is hard to stay in a bad mood when she is nearby. She is also very bright, quick to learn and always happy to help. Ariana has a lot of good ideas which make a valuable contribution in our discussions.
 
Balthasar Schlotmann
Balthasar is a limitless source of bizarre facts, including things that you always wanted to know, things you wish you could forget and many things essential to our project. His thirst for knowledge, interest in all things scientific and his willingness to try even daring things out are essential qualities that he brings to our team.
 
Caroline Fandrey
Caro is our sporty team member. Often in sporty attire she reminds us all of our New Year’s resolutions. Fitting to her style she is upbeat and energetic. Although sometimes hidden behind a very serious face, Caro can always bring laughter to the lab with her “crazy voice.”  Eager to learn more, she takes her tasks very seriously and will do all that is necessary.
 
Gintare Malininaite
Despite being a newcomer, Gintare has been taking charge of the deinking aspect of our project largely on her own - which fits in perfectly with her disposition, as she has confidence in spades and has admitted she's much more interested in the chemistry part of her study than the biology one. Gintare is forever amused by the fact that virtually every German person she has met is stumped by the name of her native country in English: Lithuania (luckily they always let out an understanding ""achso"" when she follows up with ""Litauen."")
 
Jan Niklas Hansen
Jan played an essential role in organizing our Science Slam and enriched the project with his creativity and technical skills.
 
Jonas Gockel
Highly motivated and energetic Jonas takes on any and every task you throw at him. With his ability to learn quickly, he doesn’t just master his tasks, but is also able to pass his new found knowledge on to other team members, making life in the lab just a bit easier.
 
Laura López Navarrete
Our newest exchange student. Laura's warm and supportive Spanish personality helps her get along with virtually everyone she meets. Active team member in cloning, she is always willing to lend a hand and collaborate with their colleagues, inside and outside the lab.
 
Michael Teske
Despite being a late addition to the team, level-headed Mikey is a very valuable member as he is our wiki specialist. Additionally he also gives a helping hand in cloning. The way he speaks makes one want to listen to every word he says and his input is always on point. Furthermore he rarely fails to make the team laugh.
 
Stefan Kotte
Hidden under an enjoyably calm temperament our only chemist in the team is always ready to provide us with crazy chemistry-facts, which he can explain in a refreshingly easy and understandable way. His ideas are a real addition to our project and he is a fun addition to any free time activities.
 
Triinu Linkgreim
Triinu: The ""i"" in Triinu's name is doubled, and she seems to work and talk double speed too. Quick-thinking and quick on her feet,  Triinu is a great member to have around when the need to spot problems arises. That humorous stereotype of Estonians being slow can't be more wrong in this case!

I am am a recent graduate from UC Davis with a B.A. in Science and Technology Studies and a first year law student at UC Berkeley's Boalt Hall. I completed my thesis for highest honors on interactions between speculative fiction and national security, and presented it at the ICFA conference in Florida last Spring. I was inducted into Phi Beta Kappa, and I served as the Chief Justice for the ASUCD Court in 2015. When I'm not critically investigating the relationships between science and society, I enjoy exploring cheeses from around the world, hula hooping, and watching (and rewatching) Star Trek.
Brent Weyers
I am a 5th year undergraduate student in Biomedical Engineering, graduating with my Bachelor of Science degree at the end of Fall Quarter 2016. I currently perform UG research with Dr. Tingrui Pan's Lab Group on microfluidics and quantitative biological assessments, I am on the UC Davis iGEM team, and I am working on a start-up company attempting to carry my senior capstone project forward beyond academia. I thoroughly enjoy research and I am applying for Ph.D. programs this Fall in Biomedical Engineering.

As a small team of five students we each filled a critical role in the project, and worked together with our advisors and sponsers to bring about Cyantific.
Primary Contributions:
Samir Akre: iGEM team-member Samir took on a highly interdisciplinary role within our project; Samir took a lead on our iGEM Match website and on our Wiki page, also frequently providing assistance to members working on E. coli and B. subtilis. From a website standpoint, Samir developed the entire Wiki site, populated this site with team developed content, and debugged any issues that arouse. In terms of iGEM Match, Samir contacted numerous participating iGEM institutions to invite them to the platform and facilitate collaborative efforts across iGEM teams. In wet-lab, Samir assisted with E. coli and B. subtilis experimentation through regular assistance with PCR’s, gel electrophoresis trials, cloning, bacterial cell culture, and others.
Jonathan Chen: iGEM team-member Jon took the lead on E. coli work. Jon was involved in the entire E. coli experimentation process through primer designs, genetic circuit construction, E. coli strain identification, mini-prep, PCR’s, gel-electrophoresis, cloning, bacterial cell culture, and others. Jon provided some assistance for B. subtilis experimentation, working to develop compatible parts across E. coli and B. subtilis, namely HO, PcyA, and B0015, where both genetic segments could be used within both expression chassis under appropriate Golden Gate primer design.
Brent Weyers: iGEM team-member Brent took the lead on B. subtilis work. Brent worked closely with the Bacillus Genetic Stock Center to identify optimal strains for high CBCR expression and minimal chances of protease-related protein degradation; such strains were chosen to maximize opportunity for successful NPF expression in B. subtilis . Brent was involved in the entire B. subtilis experimentation process through primer designs, RBS special considerations, genetic circuit construction, PCR’s, gel-electrophoresis, bacterial cell culture, transformation protocol identification, and promoted science collaboration with the UC Santa Cruz iGEM team. Brent also prepared content for the iGEM presentation, Wiki content and editing, and developed the team poster for presentation at the Jamboree.
Amanda Everitt: iGEM team-member Amanda took on a highly versatile role for the team’s project. Amanda developed our GAF protein characterization model, which uses protein sequence alignments and profile Hidden Markov Models, to predict what color GAF domains are likely to reflect. Amanda took a lead on identifying isolation and purification methods for the GAF protein domains as well as CBCR-GAF domain spectral analysis. Amanda additionally took the primary role on developing the iGEM team’s presentation for the Jamboree and contributed extensively to the Wiki content.
Alexis Caligiuri: iGEM team-member Alexis took a full lead on our human-practices considerations for our project. Alexis meticulously considered the relation between society and our science, and the synergistic interplay between these two domains. Alexis performed Institutional Review Board (IRB) approved surveys, identified company practices and regulations, and delved into congressional legislation, in order to thoroughly assess policies and consumer viewpoints. Through this research, Alexis identified essential aspects, upon the juxtaposition of our science and society, which merit careful consideration.
Project support and advice:
Colin Milburn: Served as an advisor for our team, meeting with us weekly for progress check-in’s.
