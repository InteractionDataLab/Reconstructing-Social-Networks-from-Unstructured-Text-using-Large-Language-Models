Dr. John Parkinson
Dr. John Parkinson aka The Dragon in the Dragon's Den
Graduated from the University of Bath with a bachelor of science in Applied Biology in 1990. After receiving a PhD in Biochemistry from the University of Manchester in 1995, I completed a NATO fellowship at the University of Manitoba. From 1997 to 2000, I was awarded a fellowship at the Edinburgh Centre for Protein Technology, University of Edinburgh and from 2000 to 2003 completed another fellowship at the University of Edinburgh on Nematode genomics. I am currently a scientist at The Hospital for Sick Children Research Institute.  The research in our laboratory is aimed at understanding how molecular information can give rise to complex biological behaviour. Using computational methods, we study the organization and dynamics of cellular components within the context of integrated biological systems. Comparative genomics methods are also being applied to provide insights into how these systems may have evolved from the remote origins of life.
Graham Cromar
Graham Cromar aka The Wizard of Id
I am a 4th year Ph.D. student in the Department of Molecular Structure and Function at the Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto.  At various times in the past I have studied cell and molecular biology (B.Sc. Toronto), molecular biology and genetics (M.Sc. Guelph), computer programming and systems analysis (dip. Inst. Computer Studies, Toronto), bioinformatics (cert. Canadian Genetic Disease Network) and, systems and matrix biology (present).  I have worked as a lab technician, teaching assistant, computer programmer/systems analyst and IS manager.  But, what I would most like to do is what I wrote in my high school yearbook about 20 years ago... Design organisms for export to far away galaxies.  Thanks to iGEM I'm 1/4 of the way there...
Stacy Hung
Stacy Hung aka Mini Wheats
With a B.Sc. Honours Biology and Bioinformatics from the University of Waterloo, Stacy is currently a 3rd year Ph.D. student at the University of Toronto.  Her main focus is to identify novel enzyme drug targets against malaria by studying the metabolic networks of these parasites.  She is inspired by anything that is new, exciting, and can have a long-term impact for making the world a better place -- besides her research, iGEM is certainly one of these things!
Daniel Wong
Daniel Wong aka The Architect
Daniel Wong received his BASc in Engineering Science biomedical option at the University of Toronto.  He is currently with the Institute of Biomaterials and Biomedical Engineering, working toward his PhD.  He works in the Cochlear Implant Laboratory at the Hospital for Sick Children, developing neuroimaging algorithms for the analysis of multichannel EEG data.  As design team lead for this year's iGEM team, he guided the design team in developing the protocols for creating the team's biobrick parts.  His academic interests include neuroimaging and systems modelling.  To relax, he enjoys a good round of golf or social salsa dancing.
Natalie Yeung
Natalie Yeung aka The Strategist
I'm a graduate student at the University of Toronto's iSchool (sometimes known as the Faculty of Information). Having been involved in iGEM previously, it's been my privilege to see other people catch the synthetic biology bug each year. This team is a great example of the creativity of multidisciplinary groups, as well as iGEM's potential to be a catalyst for innovation (and some great stories!).
Conrad Lochovsky
Conrad Lochovsky aka The Invisible Man
Conrad Lochovsky completed his BASc in Biomedical Engineering in Toronto and is currently pursuing his MASc in the exciting area of microfluidics.  With a minor in Economics, Conrad played a very important role as our treasurer.  He has also been involved with past Toronto iGEM teams: 2006(design/lab), 2007(design/lab/finance) and is active on the executive of several other campus clubs.
Students
Yen Leung
Yen Leung aka Elastigirl
Yen Leung has been an invaluable member of the iGem Wet lab team. She has always been around the lab helping out, doing experiments and keeping my (Kenny) craziness (when I come up with crazy ideas) and messiness in check. Currently Yen is pursuing a specialist degree in Nutrition and Neuroscience at the University of Toronto and in September '09 she will be entering her third year.
Kenny Zhan
Kenny Zhan aka Mad Scientist
Hi everyone my name is Kenny Zhan and I am a third year undergraduate student. I am currently pursuing a specialization in biochemistry at the University of Toronto. This year I have been part of the iGEM design team at UofT and during the summer I have been fortunate enough to be part of the roster team  that works in the lab to bring the design into reality. I find synthetic biology fascinating as I have an interest in developing new techniques and procedures to support the rapidly expanding field of biological sciences. In my free time I enjoy activities such as hiking, biking, ultimate and geocaching. Also you will see me from time to time updating our lab wiki. Hope to see you all down at the jamboree in Boston come October.
Meah Gao
Meah Gao aka The Bionic Woman
Hi everyone! I am currently a 3rd-year undergraduate student at the University of Toronto specializing in Pathobiology and majoring in Cell and Systems biology. This year as part of the Toronto Mars Discovery iGEM team, my job is to apply bioinformatics methods to identify potential protein candidates for enzymatic channeling and explore alternative microcompartment platforms. Previously, I have also been involved in projects in Neurophysiology and Cellular & Molecular Biology. My current research interest lies in genomics studies using bioinformatics tools.
James Juras
James Juras aka The Sporatic Action Man
Hey there, I'm a virgo and enjoy long snowboarding adventures in the mountains. Also in my spare time I'm a 4th year undergraduate specializing in Neuroscience at the University of Toronto. This summer I've been doing lots of work all over the place, but mainly my job has been to design the wiki you're presently navigating.

Undergrads:
Michael Milevskiy:
Studying: Bachelor of BioMedical Science, Specialising in Genetics and Developmental Biology
About me: I love basketball, which is why i am in Boston I will definitely be going to see a Celtics game. I find genetics and the development and differentiation of embryos to be the most interesting aspects of biology. After iGEM is done for the year i plan on undergoing a research project and maybe do something closely related to one of our projects.
Richard Schlegel:
Studying: Bachelor of Biomedical Science, Specialising in Physiology, Pharmacology, and Neuroscience
About me: I love to travel & have been to places around the world such as Japan, Bali, the Philippines, and Hawaii.  I've been to USA before, & would love to go again.  After iGEM, I am interested in pursuing other research projects, possibly involving cardiac physiology.  I love 'lazy days at home', and 'cooking up a storm' in the kitchen in my spare time.
Katelin Haynes:
Studying: Bachelor of Science, Majoring in Biomedical Science
About me: I'm looking forward to summer break, to complete my other research project. I wish I had more spare time, and I love it when I can laze around at home and devour novels (while eating chocolate, of course!).
Florencia Camus:
Studying: Bachelor of Science (Majors in Genetics and Evolutionary Biology)
About me: Originally from Chile, Flo has lived in Canada, Chile and Australia (not in that order). She knew that science was her calling after working all her senior year at Santiago College on Drosophila melanogaster on the inheritance of sex-linked traits. Graduated with honours in the subject of biology she moved to the University of Queensland for her Bachelors degree where she has spent the last three years. During her first two years she was a Vacation Scholar for Prof. Istvan Toth where she searched for Beta-lactam antibiotic carriers, in order to make them orally available. Currently she is in Dr. Daniel Ortiz-Barrientos lab testing sexual selection in angiosperms and the rapid evolution of reproductive proteins
Liam Nolan:
Studying: Bachelors of Science/Engineering(Chemical and Biological)
Interests: Research, piano, choir(x2), soccer, tennis, and everything nerdy...
In his spare time: Spare time? SPARE time?!
Other: Perhaps a little too enthusiastic about cards, Monty Python and Black Books for his own good.
Tom Partridge:
Studying: Bachelor of Biotechnology(Majoring in Microbial Biotechnology) Interests: Besides from being a self-confessed cricket fanatic I love to travel having recently visited Europe and Japan. iGEM has sparked my interest in research as until now I have had only little hands-on experience in the lab. The most exciting aspect of synthetic biology to me is the potential for new and innovative solutions to global problems. I am most interested in the bacteriology/virology aspect of microbial biotechnology and plan to undertake a research project over the summer holidays involving ecology and diagnosis of emerging infectious diseases. In my spare time I love to play cricket, rugby, soccer and squash.
Robert Brennan:
Studying: Bachelor of Biomedical Science, Specialising in Human Genetics
About me: Essentially I live for science and knowledge in general, this is why I jumped at the chance to involve myself in the iGEM competition.  For a few years now I have seen genetics as the most interesting aspect of biology, closely followed by virology and microbiology in general.  At the moment I could think of nothing better than being able to continue on after my degree into postgrad work, such as a PhD, in the same field.
Tam Nguyen:
About me: I am a Vietnamese... Only came to Australia for 3 years and have known about serious research for only 1.5 years... But now, I know, for sure, research is significant and interesting to me.
Studying:Bachelor of biomedical science (Major in Microbiology-Immunology and Physiology (subject to be changed!)).
Interest:Would love to know as much as about cancer and involvement of microorganism in causing cancer. I am really fascinated by what tiny virus can do on our body. And how our body works as a system, and how it defends against microbial enemy, that's always great to know about...That's all about science interest.In my spare time, well I mean real real spare time, can do anything except reading lecture notes and writing reports.
Near future plan:Really looking forward to a summer research course in micro-immune field.
Luke Sturgess:
Studying: Bachelor of Biomedical Science, Specialising in Toxicology Interests: The power of toxics to stun, paralyze and in some cases kill the organisms prey or predators is quite amazing. The smallest drop of toxin is made up of thousands of different drugs all designed to stop and kill the organism to infects. By isolating and manupulating these lethal drugs, we can design new beneficial drugs using the power of millions of years of evolution which has carefully crafted the most effective peptides to bind to and elict either positve or harmful responses. This power is absolutely amazing and is why I jumped at the chance to get some real world labatory experience from this competition. My others interests are in fishing, rock climbing and I´m a complete sports nut.
Advisors:
Wally Thomas: Chair of Physiology, Professor in the School of Biomedical Sciences. Or, his alter ego....
Peter Thorn: All Mighty; Associate Professor in the School of Biomedical Sciences. His research speciality area is the physiology of secretory processes, particularly in the pancreas.
Phil Long: Professor of Innovation and Educational Technology, and Founding director of the Centre for Education Innovaion and Technology within the University of Queensland.
Kelly Matthews: Student experience manager for the Faculty of Science.

Nando
Hi there!! I am Luis Fernando, one of the wetlabbers for LCG UNAM. About me? I can say that I’ve got a disease called “chronic insatisfaction”, what makes me start doing crazy stuff as it makes me change and upgrade myself. I hope it will be useful for the team!! Music is part of my mind and body, so I love living it at its best and eating nice food of any kind!!Long Live iGEM and the LCG UNAM Team!!!

Collaborations
IPN-UNAM-Mexico Team Colaboration
Our team has closely collaborated with IPN-UNAM-Mexico iGEM team since the early stages of both projects by the exchange of ideas and discussions about experimental and theoretical issues of both projects.
Throughout the evolution of both projects, complications and doubts became more specific and the collaboration became closer. They helped us with relevant aspects of our project model. In particular, when we were building the model for the diffusion component of our system, we found it quite hard because it incorporated considerable diffusion elements. So, we were assessed by IPN-UNAM-Mexico iGEM team on what finally would be our cellular automaton with discrete diffusion model as the best approach for this section of the project.
Since we had some troubles with a continuous model, they proposed us to use a discrete version of what we were trying to do: the discrete Laplace operator or a partial differential equations system. Finally we chose to use a discrete version of Flick's law to solve this problem, what turned out to be good for our dry lab's objectives.
Furthermore, the experimental work at the IPN-UNAM-Mexico iGEM team fell behind in the middle of the summer because their 2009 iGEM kit plate was retained by the Mexican customs and the critical bioparts for their project were not available in previous iGEM Kit plates. Therefore we supported them with elutions, transformations and plasmid extractions of the needed biobricks.
The collaboration between LCG-UNAM-Mexico and IPN-UNAM-Mexico made things easier for both teams and is a really important factor that contributed in achieving both projects' current advances.

Hello, iGEM! I’m Giulio, a 23-year-old biologist/biotechnologist.  I come from Pavia, where I’ve always been studying until now, and where I live, but I have in program to continue my studies abroad. In my free time I enjoy reading, writing short stories - and novels, too - and playing electric guitar. Travel is another of my passions and take a plane whenever possible!
The iGEM experience thrills me very much, for I’ve always been fond of crossover approach to issues (that’s why I chose Biotechnology as Bachelor Degree) and applying molecular biology in some more analytic and quantitative ways is definitely uncommon as well as exciting. What’s more, it is a chance for having contact with people with different personal formation, and culture, too!

Hi guys! My name is Elisa, I’m 22 and I come from a small town in the North-Est of Italy.
I’ve been fascinated by the iGEM experience since the first time I got in contact with it, looking at the previous UNIPV-team’s wiki.
I think it’s a unique opportunity for us, engineering students, to experience laboratory-life, learn a lot of new things and meet other people, different in approaching the problems, and so interesting!
It offers also another important chance: the opportunity to have OUR project, and see it growing up from the idea to the end. And this is very motivating for me!
About me…I like travelling, photographing and going out with friends! Don’t mind sports (skiing, running, playing football) and reading as well.

Where we're from
Faige flew from the gentle sunshine-filled city of Los Angeles and is still, after a year, learning to adjust to NYC-style weather and driving attitudes. She plans to go to medical school and has a very wide span of interests, inluding iGEM. She is majoring in Philosophy and possibly double-minoring in English and Biology while taking the pre-med requirements. She also loves dabbling in, to varying degrees, chemistry, quantum physics, economics, astronomy, psychology, writing, marine biology, ornithology, and paleontology. She enjoys visiting aviaries, aquariums, zoos, museums, and all outdoor places. Laboratories are cool, too, even though they are indoors. She occasionally thinks about becoming a sailor, pilot, dolphin, pirate, bird, wolf, or wizard, but feels that being a doctor will make the most sense in terms of reality and long-term desires.
Julie came from the sunshine state of Florida to the power state of New York City. She currently is majoring in Biochemistry and plans to pursue a field in medicine. Current hobbies of hers' include: reading, walking, knitting, Tae Kwon Do, Tennis, and dancing. She enjoys the outdoors, examples include: hiking, sitting in the park, and swimming. She happens to enjoy being part of a science team very much. Julie also enjoys observing, people tell her it is a sixth sense. She is now enjoying life with all her capabilities. Loves animals and always seeks to protect them. Will always fight for the freedom for others to be who they are and what they want to become. Never let anyone say you can't be or do something. Keep strong and keep the hope alive.
Rafi's interest in genetic engineering stems from the fact that he himself is the first successful test tube baby. He lived in a well-lit cage until the project ran out of money and was moved to a dark basement.  He escaped and ended up in New York, where he attends university. He hopes to attend a DDS/PHD program after graduating. Although ambitious, there is no doubt that he will one day be found and returned to his cage in the basement.

About Us
Our group is formed by students and instructors from The National Laboratory for Biodiversity (LANGEBIO in spanish) and the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM). The team is formed by undergraduate students in diverse disciplines such as mathematics, physics, biomedical sciences, biothecnology and biology. We believe these diversity is essential for the enrichment of our project. The instructors and advisors are also from different knowledge fields such as mathematics, biology, systems biology and computer science.  The work method of the team was as a workshop and we held reunions three times a week in the first months and then we entered an intensive laboratory work period in an all day basis. The project was mainly coordinated and done by the students. Is only with team work that we were able accomplish what we have done in the project. As an original student initiative we have done the first fieldwork in molecular biology from our university, in order to collect species with unusual molecular mechanisms. This with the purpose of isolating them, characterize them, and try to use them in future synthetic constructions (you could see some photos in the future part of the wiki).
About the project
The project was born at Facultad de Ciencias synthetic biologic group as a theoretical approach of morphogenesis. Some ideas were proposed and developed theoretically on previous igem competitions since 2006 (e.g. oscillators )
For this year students designed a device based on a gene synthetic network based on the lux and las quorum sensing genes and IPTG and ATC quemicals The team develop a modeling and simulation in silico which gave crucial dates about the experimental viability. With people of the Langebio IPN- Cinvestav Irapuato lab we was able to complete the theoretic design an tune up the experimental job.
The assembly of regulation network started at Facultad de Ciencias, UNAM. Later we moved to Langebio IPN-Cinvestav lab to work together.
To now the experimental advance has given us some ideas of how we must corroborate the Turing's proposal of morphogenesis from 1952
We can say that given the nature our team so multidisciplinary that include students, advisors from Facultad de Ciencias, IIMAS and CINVESTAV Irapuato the first synthetic biology Mexican project proposed since 2006 produced great results in the experimental and theoretical field.
On this date the proyect is 95% advance.

Brad is a graduate student in the Biological and Irrigation Engineering at Utah State University. His personal research is centered around analyzing an unknown microbial community, and characterizing it's genetic phylogeny. Brad is participating in the iGEM competition for the first time, and has enjoyed being a part of the group. He has a passion for caving, and tries to go as often as the team would let him. Other than that, he enjoys rock climbing, camping, the occasional computer game, and is excited for the duck hunting season. Brad was primarily responsible for culturing the cyanobacteria, and conducting the tri-parental mating procedure, and generally helped out around the lab.
LIBBIE LINTON
Libbie is a Masters student in Biological Engineering. Like a few others on this year's team, Libbie was also a member of the 2008 iGEM team. She is glad to be back for a second year, this time as an advisor. Her Masters' work is in investigating different ways to improve PHA production economics. She is hoping to complete her thesis within the next few months, followed by finding employment in bioprocess/biochemical engineering. In her spare time, Libbie is a musician.  She also enjoys beating fellow iGEM teammate Trent Mortensen in racquetball, as well as playing with her 6 month old puppy, Rooster. For this years' iGEM team, Libbie advised on topics related to bioplastic production, secretion systems and mechanisms, and general laboratory procedures. She was also involved in coordinating efforts with the wiki.
JUNLING HUO
Junling Huo is a PhD student in Biological Engineering at USU. His dissertation research is focused on design a gene expression system for Rhodobacter sphaeroides, which is a photosynthetic bacteria. This gene expression system will include BioBrick compatible promoters, Ribosome Binding Sites (RBS), and terminators. The planned promoters and RBS will have different activities. Terminators will be either bidirectional or unidirectional. He hopes to complete his dissertation in the next year or so, and continuing doing research. He was also a member of 2008 USU iGEM team, and is happy to serve as an advisor again this year.

Utah State University
Located in Logan, Utah , about 80 miles north of Salt Lake City, Utah State University sits just outside the mouth of Logan Canyon. The city, founded in 1859, has a population of approximately 47,000 and boasts a rich heritage. Whether on campus, historic Main Street, down in the “island”, or up the canyon, there is always something to do.
Originally founded in 1888 as the Agricultural College of Utah, the school officially became a university in 1957. As the state's land-and space-grant university, USU conducts world-class research in many disciplines and has several projects in conjunction with the Department of Defense and NASA. USU’s research program is second in age only to MIT in the United States. USU's Space Dynamics Laboratory has put more experiments into space than any university in the world and is ranked first in the United States for funding for aerospace research.
The engineering program at Utah State is known for its excellence, with a 96% first-time pass rate on the national engineering exam compared to a national average of 55%. Beyond the Logan campus, Utah State's Extension programs extend academic resources and support throughout the entire state of Utah, having extension locations in each of Utah's 29 counties.
Biological and Irrigation Engineering is a relatively small department at Utah State, with about 30 faculty and 120 undergraduate and graduate students. This great student-to-teacher ratio helps students succeed in their classes. The Biological Engineering Program teaches students to manipulate biological systems for useful purposes, understand scientific literature, and to work well and communicate effectively with others, both in the field of Biological Engineering and out. In the first years of the program, students learn the basics of biology, chemistry, physics, and mathematics. This knowledge base is then broadened by a study of liberal arts and humanities including literature, philosophy, political science, art, and music classes. Students finally delve into technical engineering courses, many chosen personally by students to apply to their particular areas of interest. These courses develop practical problem-solving abilities, increasing sensitivity to the economic, social, and legal dimensions of technical problems. Students leave the program well-qualified for their careers, with an understanding of the importance of social and professional ethics and responsibility to accompany their technical learning. After graduation, students will apply their knowledge to a wide range of careers, from genetic engineering to design of prosthetic devices for amputees.

Prof. George Attard
George came to Southampton as a SERC Advanced Fellow before  records began. He was appointed as Professor in 2001 but nobody bothered to  tell him what in. Since then he’s been trying to find out what he’s supposed to  be world-class in. Apparently, George is our project supervisor. However, he  prefers to spend his time on ‘family holidays’, and deciding on wearing the  best combination of three different suits at the same time.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Dr. Ali Tavassoli
Ali was appointed as a lecturer in Chemical Biology in 2006  hot from the Benkovic intellectual hot house. Since then he has won many hot  awards, including a Career Establishment Award from Cancer Research UK,  arousing his colleagues’ envy. Every day without fail, Ali likes to don his  favourite silk shorts and go running around the labs, returning to his office  looking hot. In his spare time he *is* Adam Sandler.
 
 
 
 
 
 
Dr. Eugen Stulz
Eugen Stulz is the groups’ ice man. He is believed to have  lain deeply frozen in ice high up the Ötzal Alps for more than 5000 years, but  was thawed as a result of global warming and migrated to Southampton, where he  was recognised to be in fact a wild pokémon. There he has been perfecting his  annoying special ability of attaching porphyrins to anything he touches. He is  banned from obtaining, handling or consuming any of the iGEM students’ DNA  until the Jamboree.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Dr. Klaus-Peter Zauner
Klaus-Peter Zauner can sometimes be found in the School of  Electronics & Computer Science. It has been reported that he created a  six-legged robot controlled by the photophobic Physarum polycephalum. What has  not been reported is that he too is under Physarum control, a trait he shares  with other microsoft-branded objects. Travelling to exotic places wearing  nothing but a very large SLR can sometimes restore his pre-microsoft settings.

The University of Southampton was originally  known as the Hartley Institute, named for the benefactor, Henry Robertson  Hartley (1777 – 1850). Funded by a donation upon his death the Institute was  built, and opened on October 15th 1862 by the Prime Minister Lord  Palmerston, as a centre for the city’s elite. In 1883, the institute was  rebranded as Hartley College and subsequently, in 1902, became Hartley  University College, allowing it to award degrees on behalf of the University of  London. Increasing attendance at the university throughout this period  encouraged expansion of the facilities, and in 1914 the college opened at its  current site in Highfield. The 1920’s and 1930’s saw the addition of many of  the signature buildings of the university, including the Hartley Library,  right. In 1952, in the first Royal Charter issued by HM Queen Elizabeth II, the  College attained full University status, allowing it to award its own degrees,  the first of which were awarded on the 4th July 1953.
 
Today, the university is one of the top 20  centres for undergraduate study in the UK, top 15 for research, and provides  higher education to over 24,000 undergraduate and postgraduate students. In  1994, it became a member of the newly formed Russell Group, a collaboration of  British universities aimed at maximizing the research potential of UK  institutions. Research at Southampton brings in over half of the total income  of the university, and is conducted in a wide range of subjects within the core  faculties of Law, Arts and Social Sciences; Engineering, Science and  Mathematics; and Medicine, Health and Life Sciences.
 
The campus at Highfield is home to the majority  of the university, including recent additions such as the new Mountbatten  building, home to the department of Electronics and Computer Science, the  Institute for Life Sciences, which is under construction to replace the former  site at Boldrewood, and the School of Chemistry, in which the 2009 iGEM  Southampton Team is based. Highfield is also home to the majority of the  student facilities, such as the aforementioned Hartley Library, the Student’s  Union, and the Jubilee Sports Centre, built in 2004 to commemorate the 50th  anniversary of the university. Nearby, Avenue campus is home to the school of  Humanities, including the centre for language studies, and there is also a  division of the university in Winchester, the School of Art. The University  also operates the National Oceanography Centre, the leading centre for research  in marine and earth sciences in the UK.
The University of Southampton is ranked 95th  in the Times Higher Education Supplement QS World University Rankings, 2009 (QS  Intelligence Unit, www.topuniversities.com ).

City of Southampton
 
 
 
 
The city of Southampton is located on the  central south coast of the United Kingdom, approximately 60 miles south-west of  London. With an estimated population of around 230,000, it is the largest city  in the county of Hampshire. Southampton is a major commercial port, being one  of the largest in Europe, handling many large goods vessels, and more notably,  is home to some of the world’s largest cruise vessels. The city’s close union  with the sea has dated back many years, with RMS Titanic setting sail from the  port in 1912.
Within Southampton, major employers include the  University of Southampton, Southampton Solent University, Ford, British  Broadcasting Corportation (BBC), Ordnance Survey and the National Health  Service (NHS). Southampton is affectionately known as the “Home of the Ford  Transit”, Europe’s best-selling light commercial vehicle, with the Transit  production plant sited on the outskirts of the city.
It is thought that settlers have inhabited the  locale of Southampton since the stoneage, when it was known as Porth Hamon.  Following Roman invasion almost two millennia ago, the fortress settlement of  Clausentum was established. Anglo-saxon settlement gave rise to Hampton  (formerly Hamwic and then Hamtun), in the current east side of the city. It was  not until medieval times that the city gained the name of Southampton. One of  the most famous pieces of Southampton’s history that can still be seen today is  the presence of the medieval walls and the Bargate, in the city’s centre,  something that is reflected in the Southampton City Council identity. The  remnants of the city walls are thought to be some of the longest surviving in  the UK. In it’s more recent history, Southampton obtained official city status  in 1964, and became a unitary authority in 1997.
Interesting facts about Southampton:
The Supermarine Spitfire was  designed and developed in Southampton
In 1912, RMS Titanic set-sail  on it’s tragic maiden voyage
Former home to Jane Austen
Home to West Quay shopping  centre, among the UK’s largest indoor shopping centres
UK’s only city with a  geothermal power-station, helping the city gain the accolade of one of the UK’s  lowest carbon-emitting cities
Boasts the UK’s largest  capacity club, Oceana Southampton, housing Europe’s largest “Saturday Night  Fever” illuminated dancefloor
One of the host cities of the  World Naked Bike Ride!

IIT iGEM 2008
Abdul Majeed
I am currently in my fourth year, pursuing a dual degree in Bioengineering at IIT Madras. I did my schooling at Dubai and then came to India for professional studies. Well, my research interests include Systems Biology and Biochemical engineering. But since the past 8 months while working for iGEM 2009, I developed a passion for Synthetic Biology. My past research experience include working for Dr.Reed's group on Constrain based network analysis of sugar fermentation in Saccharomyces Cerevisiae at University of Wisconsin, Madison(Summer 2009) and an Industrial experience at Dr. Reddys Laboratory(Summer 2008). I enjoy playing and watching soccer. I aim high in life and try to keep up to my set standards. See you guys at the Jamboree!

Ajit Kamath
I am from Mumbai, India. I love playing with cells and making them do our bidding. Apart from synthetic biology, I am also interested in Developmental Immunology. I was in Bonn, Germany for the last summer studying Eosinophil activation and development in mice.
I shall finish my Masters from IIT Madras in 2011. Apart from playing with cells, I like playing with computers. Some of my hobbies include cooking, reading, writing blogs and music.
My Biggest and Dearest Hobby: Cracking the vaguest of Jokes. Ask my Team mates for confirmation. ;)
To hear some of them buzz me at ajit9988@gmail.com
Arun Murali
Hello World. Currently in my fourth year in the Department of Biotechnology, I am primarily interested in Molecular Biology. As for my research experience, I was in Germany this summer working on certain cell death pathways and interaction studies between proteins involved in the pathways.
Coming to my hobbies and other eccentricities, I play Football and Table Tennis, participate in a range of Literary activities (quizzes, Creative writing, Dramatics, word games etc), and also listen to most kinds of music, though I prefer alternative metal.  I also have a vague fascination with the number 19. Oh and the Flying Spaghetti Monster…. His Noodliness Rocks!
P.S. Chuck Norris has ATP, only for him it is Adenosine Tetra Phosphate! (One of those lab nights where we were waiting for a gel to run, right Srivats?)

Bhavya B
Hi! Iam currently in fourth year, pursuing a Dual Degree from the Dept of Biotechnology, IIT Madras.I had a great time working for iGEM 2009. It helped me in gaining knowledge about synthetic biology,which adds the spirit of engineering to biology.Working in labs was never more fun and I am gonna miss all the lab hours and the night outs!
As for my research experience, I spent this summer(May-July 2009) working as an intern in BIOCON (India) in the cell culture lab where i studied the amino acid consumption patterns of mammalian (CHO) cells.
Academics aside, i love music, dancing, spending lazy days with food and fictions, trying my hand at cooking and most of all shopping!!Looking forward to see you all at the Jamboree!

Namaste everyone, This is Harsh a.k.a takla, yogi, bokka etc. I dont like boasting about myself, because i am so intelligent and smart that I don't need to talk about it ;) Just kidding, but seriously ;) ;)
I feel lucky to be in the iGEM'09 team of IITMadras, firstly because its an awsome team, and secondly, some of the best moments of my college life revolve around iGEM.
My research interests include Developmental Biology, Immunology and Neurobiology. I have worked on 2 summer projects, one on ""Developing DNA microarray test for identifying HIV-1 subtypes"" and the other one was on "" Role of Hesr-1 and Hesr2 genes in Mouse Myocardium"". My other hobbies include cooking, making friends, DANCING, reading novels etc. Besides my acads, I am exploring spirituality, though its just a start now.

Hello Everyone. I am presently in 4th year of my Dual Degree Program at Dept. of Biotechnology,IIT Madras. I am interested in Computational Biology, as mathematics is what I like. My recently concluded work is ""Analysis of navigation of honey bee on the basis of Levy flight , under the guidance of Dr. Dr. h.c.Randolf Menzel, Freie University, Berlin. While working for iGEM I realized Mol Bio is not my cup of tea.
I also have keen interest in Economics, History and Political Science. I am hard core fan of Cricket and this is the only sports which I play. I love cooking, traveling, writing poems (ob! Hindi),old Hindi melodies.

Hello, hmmmmmmmm.
Currently in fourth year, I am, pursuing a B.Tech in Biotechnology at IIT Madras.  Herh herh herh.
Being an undergraduate, all the time in the world to pursue my hobbies like a profession, I have, which include synthetic biology, photography (shooting the skies, I like and making time-lapse movies,  I love), cycling, trekking and trying to understand evolution and its implications.
Being an undergraduate, I am poor enough to not have a lab of my own to make cells do some really crazy stuff I would like them do, to not have an Olympus E3 with some really awesome f/1.4 super tele-lens, to not have a Trek 5900 and to not have some pro camping gear.
Having not wasted any summers of my undergraduate life, I have managed to build a cool vertical take-off and landing vehicle, simulate how HIV-1 protease moves around in a solution (Bangalore is a lovely place to be in during summers) and program cells to behave like a clock with a customized period (oh! I also happened to be New York that summer and I just can't live without spicy Indian food. The lab i worked in made a tic-tac-toe playing machine with RNA molecules! how cool is that?). I am pretty much hooked up with making cells do some crazy stuff, mostly fancy, which people would like to use it elsewhere.

Greetings, synthetic biologists and Stumblers alike. I am currently in my fourth year, pursuing a dual degree in Biotechnology at IIT Madras. I am primarily a molecular biologist and have previously worked on The mechanisms of Puf5p mediated translational repression in S. cerevisiae and a sequence/structure analysis of Puf5 binding to the HO mRNA 3’ UTR in Dr. Wickens' lab at the University of Wisconsin, Madison(Summer 2009).
That apart, I am an avid quizzer, fan of Queen, Star Wars, and His Noodliness, the Flying Spaghetti Monster. My ambition in life is to one day have an Erdős–Bacon number of under 6, and I am one of those who sincerely believe that the answer to Life, the Universe and everything is 42! See you at the Jamboree. Bring a towel.

Hi! I am a final year undergrad student interested in Molecular and Cell Biology. My summer project this year at the Max-Planck Institute for Molecular Cell Biology and Genetics in Tony and Joe's labs made Biophysics and Systems Biology my new found interests which I am all set to pursue through graduate studies. It has been a great experience working as a team for iGEM 2009. Though I took some time in the beginning to get the hang of synthetic biology and how networks work, it was a complete learning experience and more importantly lot of  fun.
If I am not busy with science, you'll find me playing around with Python (something which I began recently), listening to Beatles, reading books, look around to grab some coffee or just having fun. All set to meet you guys at the Jamboree!

Research Interests
The primary objective of my research team is to elucidate molecular and cellular mechanisms of normal and aberrant function of blood vessels under physiological and patho-physiological conditions respectively. The key areas we focus on are endothelial dysfunction, atherosclerosis and edema. In order to obtain a holistic picture on these issues we would subscribe to the following approaches:
High through put screening for identification of changes in gene expression from clinical samples.
In vitro tissue culture experiments to identify signaling intermediates altered under pathological settings. For this we would employ primary cultures of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs), and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs).
Validation of in vitro data through in vivo animal experiments.
Use of viral vector based gene delivery systems to rectify the faulty functioning of the signaling intermediates.

IIT iGEM 2008
Indian Institute of Technology Madras , is one among the foremost institutes of national importance in higher technological education, basic and applied research in India. In 1956, the German Government offered technical assistance for establishing an institute of higher education in engineering in India. The first Indo-German agreement in Bonn, West Germany for the establishment of the Indian Institute of Technology at Madras was signed in 1959.
The Institute was formally inaugurated in 1959 by Prof. Humayun Kabir, Union Minister for Scientific Research and Cultural Affairs. The IIT system has seven Institutes of Technology located at Kharagpur (estb. 1951), Mumbai (estb. 1958), Chennai (estb. 1959), Kanpur (estb. 1959), Delhi (estb. 1961), Guwahati (estb. 1994) and Roorkee (estb. 1847, joined IITs in 2001).
IIT Madras is a residential institute with nearly 460 faculty, 4500 students and 1250 administrative & supporting staff and is a self-contained campus located in a beautiful wooded land of about 250 hectares. It has established itself as a premier centre for teaching, research and industrial consultancy in the country.
The Institute has fifteen academic departments and a few advanced research centres in various disciplines of engineering and pure sciences, with nearly 100 laboratories organised in a unique pattern of functioning. A faculty of international repute, a brilliant student community, excellent technical & supporting staff and an effective administration have all contributed to the pre-eminent status of IIT Madras. The campus is located in the city of Chennai , previously known as Madras. Chennai is the state capital of Tamilnadu, a southern state in India.

The Brown iGEM Lab is entirely student-run and consists of nine Brown University undergraduates. We began our training last spring with a lab course in Synthetic Biology. Under the gracious support of the Brown Undergraduate Teaching and Research Award (UTRA) Program and funding from various other academic departments, we were able to work throughout the summer on our project. Though the project's generation and implementation was an entirely student-directed process, the team owes much of its academic and research support to the faculty and graduate student advisers that helped make everything possible. Here at Brown, we pride ourselves in upholding the ideals set out by the iGEM competition, namely that the project we have set out to create is fully our own (from creation to completion) and that each student involved in the program be afforded his/her full opportunity to both learn and contribute in the lab. Therefore, in the true spirit of Synthetic Biology, our team's project this year works hard to reflect the many different research backgrounds contributed by its nine individual members; elements of electrical engineering, electrochemistry, genetics, and microbiology are incorporated.

CONTRIBUTIONS
We started our project last October. It started from learning what is synthetic biology visiting laboratories of our interests during the first few months. Each member had his/her own interests, and we decided to work on four projects (It turned out to be very tough, as we had too much to do and it was almost impossible for each member to fully catch up with the all projects).
The rough plan was settled on July and we started our experiments. The laboratory was a little far from our home, we had a trip of one hour and a half before getting there.
The school was over at the beginning of August, the longed summer vacation started. At first, it was numerous mistakes and failures. Since most of the team members were beginners, we didn't know how to do PCR! Also, it was very difficult to communicate since we worked in shifts. Although we shared notebook, at first we didn't know what information is important. The most difficult thing for us was sequencing and we made mistake again and again, the experiment didn't proceed due to the lack of the sequencing data. Through series of trial and error, we learned what to write on the notebook, how to do our experiment most effectively, how to use the laboratory machines. We gradually learned to succeed in each experiments.
But alas! The summer vacation was now over, and school started once again in October. Our projects had still long way to go. Members went to the lab after the classes over, and worked through night.
DAITI TAMARU was our excellent adviser of all the projects. Our plan would not ever have been settled without his advices.
CRAIG HAMILTON advised us how to present our projects on wiki. He helped us to submit the forms in English.
YUTARO KII found sponsors of our projects.
LDLR
Our best of the best of the best leader CHIE UMATANI was rich in experience in biological experiment, and make protocols of iGEM experiments, told us experimental tips in order not to make mistakes and to successfully complete the experiments. She also understood well about each projects and made overall plan.
HIROKI KAWAI stayed in the lab for many days, and did the experiments though night. As we were running short of time, it was of great help.
YUSHI SUZUKI wrote our project abstract without sleeping for two days.
HIROYUKI YAMAZAKI's careful experiments was our breakthrough to PCR LDLR gene.
TAKAKI YAMAMOTO's success in the DNA sequencing of many parts promoted us to go on to the next experimental steps.
TABACCO
KOJI TANAKA, the director of tobacco projects, also worked on ethical problems.
BREAD
AKIKO NISHIMURA and TAKUYA KOMURA planed the bread projects .
BIOCLOCK
MASASHI SALVADOR made our wiki format.
XIN YIN wrote a complicated program for Bioclock project modeling.
XIASONG SUN came to the lab when others couldn't during the examination.
MARINA KOMATSU made a presentation at a meeting of synthetic biology.
AND ALL THE MEMBERS CONTRIBUTED TO THE EXPERIMENTS AND MAKING WIKI. OUR PROJECT WOULD NEVER BE LIKE IT IS WITHOUT ANY OF YOU. WE HAD A GREAT IGEM YEAR TOGETHER! THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH!

Brief Introduction About Ourselves
Ruben Fernández Moya
Hi!! My name is Ruben and I am studying Chemical Engineering in the Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona. I come from Mataró, a city near Barcelona (by the way it has an awesome party in the last days of July, you will be welcomed). I really like engineering biosystems and use microorganism wherever we need, especially simulate them mathematically. Apart of it I love watching The Big Bang Theory, the best TV series ever, and I usually play basketball, my favorite sport. See you in the Jamboree!!
Arturo Morales Portillo
I’m a student from the Faculty of Pharmacy in Granada. I’m a teaching assistant in the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology II. Besides molecular biology I’m interested in music, computers and going out with my friends.
Alberto Osuna Gálvez
My name is Alberto Osuna Gálvez and I’m studying 4th of Pharmacy at the University of Granada. I’m a teaching assistant in the department of Medicinal Chemistry. My passions are chemistry, anime and sleep 14 hours per day. Definitely, I’m a truly biological machine!
Antonio Freire González
Hi everyone! I am Antonio Freire González and I come from Vigo, the most populated city in Galicia and the biggest fishing port in Europe.
I am studying 4th year of Pharmacy in the University of Santiago de Compostela, famous worldwide thanks to its cathedral, where pilgrims from all around the world head to. I’m a teaching assistant in the department of Medicinal Chemistry.
My passions are waking up Alberto at 6 AM and sleeping in every possible place. I have already slept behind a box in the lab, laid on a bench in the corridors of the Engineering School ...
I also have other less important hobbies, like playing basketball or geography
See you all in BOSTON!

Joaquin Ariño and Asier Gonzalez ( Departamento de Bioquimica y Biologia Celular ), Universidad Autonoma de Barcelona. These project wouldn't have been possible without the continuos help and support of the group of Joaquin Ariño in UAB (Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona). The paper 'Characterization of the Calcium-mediated Response to Alkaline Stress in Saccharomyces cerevisiae' by Viladevall, et al, has been our bible during these months. Asier and Joaquin have been extremely kind and have always helped us with the protocol, our results or even emotinal support when things didn't go as expected. Again, without them this project wouldn't have been possible.

Sergi Morais Ezquerro, Ángel Maquieira Català and Miguel Ángel González Martínez. Mesuring luminiscense was hard and nearly impossible without the help of the Instituto de química molecular aplicada (Applied Molecular Chemistry Institute). They let us use their two luminometers and for the first time we saw the light. We have been more than a month in their laboratory, using their equipment and tools, and they have been always there to help us when we had problems.
Raquel Galian. Back when we didn't have our amazing results, we had to look for a suitable mesuring device. Raquel let us the spectoflurimeter, helped us with its function and maintenance and cheer us up when we were down.
Irene Murillo helped us with our coelenterazine dissolutions and always welcomed us with a huge smile.

Safety
For iGEM 2009 teams are asked to detail how they approached any issues of biological safety associated with their projects.
Specifically, teams should consider the following four questions:
1, Would any of your project ideas raise safety issues in terms of:
researcher safety,
public safety, or
environmental safety?
No, our project ideas would not raise any safety issues. I think...
2, Is there a local biosafety group, committee, or review board at your institution?
Yes
3, What does your local biosafety group think about your project?
I don't know.
4, Do any of the new BioBrick parts that you made this year raise any safety issues?
No
5, *If yes, did you document these issues in the Registry?
Teams, please document any answers to these (or other) safety questions in your presentation, wiki presentation, or poster.
Judges will be asked to evaluate your project, in part, on the basis of if and how you considered and addressed issues of biological safety.
If any questions arise regarding iGEM and biological safety please send an email to safety AT igem.org.
We participated in these team's survey.

Who we are
The University of Waterloo's 2009 iGEM Team is a dynamic group, consisting of students from the Faculties of Science, Engineering, and Mathematics. We are an undergraduate-run team, with a student Director managing most of our team's affairs and directing our team's ongoing activities. Our enthusiastic Faculty Instructors and Advisors give us the benefit of their experience and, in the case of Dr. Trevor Charles, lab space, and provide us with additional support and guidance in areas related to design, mathematical modeling, lab work and administration.
Because of Waterloo's co-op program, some of our members take courses during the summer, while others work full-time. The majority of our team members participate in the iGEM competition in their spare time, outside of work or school; a few have been involved part-time as part of their research-assistant positions in various labs in the UW Department of Biology. This team structure means that instead of each member taking on one aspect of the project to tackle over the course of the summer, our team collectively works on the project as a whole, each member picking up where the last left off the day before, or even earlier the same day!
UW iGEM Team members are all involved in a unique learning experience: our 2009 team consists largely of students who started with little or no research/laboratory experience and had a range of theoretical knowledge of molecular biology.  A strong desire to learn, combined with proper guidance from more experienced teammates, have aided these students in becoming independent and more comfortable working in a lab environment. Our senior members also have had valuable opportunities to share their experience with others.

Where we worked
We were very fortunate to have the use of two molecular biology workspaces: a dedicated undergraduate lab in the Electrical Engineering Department that had been set up for basic molecular biology work, and the lab of Dr. David Baker in Biochemistry.
Between some shelves in the Baker lab, Chris eyes some RFP-expressing bacterial pellet that Josef produced.  Great pellet Josef!
Doug rocks the purple gloves in the undergraduate molecular biology lab in the Electrical Engineering Department.
Jeff, a two-year iGEM veteran, has mastered the art of standing while pipetting.
Josef in the iGEM lab, working hard - that gel is not going to load itself.
This is how Alex pipettes.
Gene synthesis from scratch requires a lot of oligos!  (See our Notebook page)
Support
Funding for supplies and travel was obtained from the Departments of Bioengineering and Electrical Engineering at the University of Washington, and the College of Engineering.
We also received several free samples of reagents from the BioMoles gel purification kits, PCR purification kits, and a pair of agarose gels, as well as a DNA ladder.

Hi everyone!!!
We are team iBB from the University of Pune. Our institute is a center for excellence in research in biotechnology.
Our iGEM Team consists of 7 undergrads and 2 advisors.
IBB_Pune Team

The IBB iGEM story
It all began in July 2008 when Samit read about iGEM and the whole idea fascinated him...it remained a topic of hot discussions and really intense brainstorming in IBB for months together until it slowly waned away due to the exams and normal curriculum.....people forgot what iGEM was until the day a mail was received by Mandar about the registration, and as always the IBB trio; Mandar, Swetha and Samit started the registration process at the eleventh hour....The task was tedious and tiring and there was a lot of red tapism they had to go through... finally the hard work paid off... And IBB got into iGEM.....
Wish us luck!

The Team
Left to right: Richard, Bing, Lesia, Adam, Thien, Nina, Joanna; Seated: Douglas
The 2009 University of California Berkeley Software team was composed of seven undergraduate students, one postdoctoral instructor ( Douglas Densmore ) and one faculty advisor ( J.Christopher Anderson ). The team was made up of both bioengineering as well as electrical engineering and computer science students. The participants were selected from over 100 applicants which applied in the Spring of 2009 to be members of the team. Students were selected based on GPA, related research experience, performance on a series of tutorials, letters of recommendation, and short interview sessions.
The team was broken into four projects: Bing Xia focused on revamping the general software infrastructure . Joanna Chen and Richard Mar developed Spectacles . Thien Nguyen and Nina Revko examined assembly protocols and workflow design . Finally, Lesia Bilitchenko and Adam Liu created Eugene .
The team was funded by the National Science Foundation , the Synthetic Biology Engineering Research Center , qb3 , the Coalition to Diversify Computing , and the Center for Hybrid Embedded Systems Software . We want to thank all our sponsors and are excited to present our work at the jamboree!
Lesia Bilitchenko
Lesia Bilitchenko
Lesia is a 4th year Computer Science major at Cal Poly Pomona . She joined the iGEM 2009 team through the SUPERB program and absolutely enjoyed the experience. Her previous research was in computer vision and place recognition. She intends to pursue graduate studies in parallel computing . Lesia worked on Eugene during the summer. Her non-academic interests include running, reading, watching movies and learning new (both programming and spoken) languages.
Joanna Chen
Joanna Chen
Joanna is a 4th year Bioengineering major with a concentration in computational bioengineering at UC Berkeley. Last summer, she did research in a lab working on ab initio protein structure prediction. For iGEM this summer, Joanna worked on the Spectacles visualization tool, more specifically, the import/export Eugene functionalities and the ability to get database information to Spectacles through the Clotho Data API. She also did most of the layout for the team's wiki. In other extracurricular activities, Joanna is an officer of the CA-Alpha chapter of Tau Beta Pi , the Engineering Honor Society. Outside of academics, she enjoys playing the piano, working on crafts projects with beads, and making unit origami when she has free time. Joanna was born and raised in San Jose, CA .

The iGEM 2009 team
Team organisation
The DTU iGEM '09 team was formed on the initiative of assistant professor, Kiran Raosaheb Patil. The six of us quickly came together, and with inspiration from our four advisors, a project was formulated. The organisation of the team is based on the bottom-up approach, and from day one we have been very self-suffient, spearheading fundraising, laboratory work, and all other practical details ourselves.
Meet the team!

What we did
The aim of this project is to model and construct a molecular NAD+/NADH ratio sensing system in Saccharomyces cerevisiae by using a synthetic biology approach. The sensor will work as an inducible transcription factor, being active only at certain levels of the NAD+/NADH ratios. By coupling the sensor to the expression of a reporter gene, the system can be used for monitoring the NAD+/NADH redox poise in vivo. This will be beneficial for research in many areas including productivity optimization and cancer research. Furthermore, the sensor will be coupled to the biosynthesis of a gene-product (e.g. insulin), in an attempt to improve and prolong chemostat fermentation processes by producing in small bursts, thereby limiting cell stress.
Where we're from
We are a team of engineering student from the Technical University of Denmark, located in Lyngby north of the nations capitol, Copenhagen.

Also a special thanks to PhD student Simon Carlsen for invaluable experimental advice and practical help, and to Post. Doc Bjarne Gram Hansen for sharing his expertise on USER fusion, and for his help constructing our redoxilator construct. We also owe thanks to Post. Doc. Line Albertsen for helping with the redoxilator construct, and for her input for design of protein fusions using linkers.
Many thanks to associate professor Chris Workman and PhD student Emmanouil Papadakis for taking time out of their busy schedules to help us with GFP measurements.
Last but not least, thanks to master's student Marc Juul Christoffersen for helping with the web interface and server uplink of the USER fusion primer design program - Watch out for this guy at next years iGEM comp!
Achievements
Redox sensing device
Two novel genes have been designed and synthesized each comprised of 5 genetic elements. Together they function as a device termed the Redoxilator that can sense the internal redox state of a yeast cell, and output a reporter signal. Extensive mathematical modelling was performed to simulate how the construct would operate in vivo.
Biobricks
DNA of several new biobricks have been designed and submitted including a yeast optimized GFP reporter protein, a protein degradation sequence and a fast degradable yeast GFP. (Bronze medal)
We have demonstrated that our USER fusion biobrick works as expected and documented it (silver medal)
USER fusion Assembly standard
A new biobrick assembly standard that allows the rapid construction of multi-part devices have been developed and documented. The assembly standard offers many benefits: All restriction sites are allowed, multiple biobricks can be joined in one step, the result is scar-free making it ideal for protein fusions and more. (Gold medal)
USER-fusion primer design software
A novel and very useful software tool have been developed that can automatically design the optimal primers for USER fusion assembly of 2-9 biobricks, taking several parameters into account.

University
The University of Heidelberg, also called Ruprecht Karl University of Heidelberg, is the most ancient university of Germany. The University Heidelberg is one of the leading research university in Europe and is constantly ranked 1st or 2nd  nationally.   The excellent research is shown by the fact that 30 Nobel Prize laureates are associated with the University Heidelberg. The 12 faculties host over 26.000 students and about 4200 full-time staff members. Associated institutions like the German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), the European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL) and several Max-Planck institutes contribute to the excellent scientific reputation.
DKFZ
German Cancer Research Center
How do malignant tumours develop? In Germany, cancer, with over 450,000 new cases diagnosed and 270,000 deaths each year, is one of the most dreaded diseases and the second most frequent cause of death nation-wide. How can they be prevented or at least diagnosed at an early stage and treated more effectively? In recent years, tremendous effort has been invested in the fight against cancer and researchers at the German Cancer Research Center in Heidelberg have achieved major advances both in basic research and in the development of novel methods for clinical application. This has received special recognition in 2008, when Professor Harald zur Hausen was awarded the Nobel Prize for Medicine for his outstanding scientific contribution to the study of human papillomaviruses (HPV). Cutting-edge research for fighting against this threatening disease is performed here in Heidelberg by over 2000 scientific members, including professional researchers and students. The German Cancer Research Center (Deutsches Krebsforschungszentrum, DKFZ) is the largest biomedical research institute in Germany and is a member of the Helmholtz Association of National Research Centers. Besides its multi-faceted research focuses, the german cancer research provides a brilliant platform for scientists of the next generation by offering a Master's program in Cancer Biology in close cooperation with the University of Heidelberg as well as an internatinal Ph.D. program called the Helmholtz International Graduate School for Cancer Research.
BioQuant
The Bioquant is part of the University of Heidelberg and integrates  groups from different disciplines to help them focus on their research  tasks.
Quantitative analyzes of biological processes is one of the important  tasks that medicine and biology face in the post-genomic era. Those  analyzes are very useful to understand fundamental mechanisms and their  development and especially to get insights into disturbance and  regulation of biological processes. In the medicine it will lead to  improved diagnoses as well as therapys. It might also help to prevent  new diseases from developing. Besides experimental accumulation of  biological data and their analysis with bioinformatics, it is important  to model and simulate these processes, primarily to validate  experiments. The improvement of those methods and their expansion to  more complex systems is the goal of Bioquant's research teams.
BioRegion RN
<imagemap> Image:HD09_BioRN.jpg|center|BioRegion Rhein-Neckar. Click on the triangle in the picture to see the enlarged map.|450px|thumb rect 150 400 200 470 BioRegion Rhein-Neckar desc bottom-left </imagemap>
High-perfomance industry and a lot of outstanding research institutions
BioRegion Rhein-Neckar is one of Germany’s leading clusters and contains areas of three German States: Rheinland-Pfalz, Baden-Württemberg and Hessen. This cluster defines a combination of medicine, biotechnology and fundamental research to build up a major scientific and industrial region in Europe.  Many important academic and industrial facilities are members of the BioRegion Rhein-Neckar (see member list). This region concentrates elite research in the range of molecular biology and molecular medicine.  The University of Heidelberg, the European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL), the German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ) and the Max-Planck Institute for Medical Research are part of this scientific excellence. This is supplemented by the University of Mannheim and Kaiserslautern. Besides, the cities of Heidelberg, Ludwigshafen and Mannheim present an important industrial conurbation with key aspects of chemical industry and electrical and mechanical engineering. These include the companies Roche Diagnostics, BASF, Abbott, Merck, Baxter and Aventis Pasteur. The software company SAP and the financial service provider MLP are essential members of the service sector.

Students
Michael Bartoschek
Michael is a bachelor student of Molecular Biotechnology at the Ruprecht-Karls University Heidelberg. He has recently finished the 4th semester. He likes the idea of Synthetic Biology and iGEM. He is looking forward on working with a highly motivated, young team and learning much about arranging own scientific projects.
Simon Haas
Simon is a Bachelor student in Molecular Cell Biology at the University of Heidelberg in the 4th semester. During several smaller internships at institutions like the BZH, ZMBH, HIP, ZI he gained experience in experimental molecular and cellular biology and biochemistry. He is fascinated by the idea of creating functional synthetic systems in biology. Besides Synthetic Biology Simon is highly interested in the fields of gene therapy and neuroscience. He will continue his studies in Biochemistry at the Imperial College London next semester.
Tim Heinemann
Tim started his scientific career at the Humboldt University Berlin with the Bachelor program of Theoretical Biophysics. Inspired by the beautiful cultural and academic atmosphere of Germany's capital he first encountered the field of Theoretical Biology. After three years he wrote his thesis in multivariate statistical analysis at the department of physics at the Free University Berlin. Currently he completes the second semester of his studies of Systems Biology within the Master's program Molecular Biosciences at the University of Heidelberg. During this work he realized that having knowledge in both the theoretical and practical field is essential to model biological systems. For example to make a good theoretical model it is necessary to be aware of the approximate character of the experiment and to evaluate the collected data. According to him this combination of the theoretical and the experimental approach is impressively realized with the iGEM idea. He is grateful to be part of this year's team and to have a nice summer with the students.
Corinna Hiller
Corinna has finished her bachelor thesis about experimental and computer-associated search for p53 inhibiting agents with subsequent validation by crystallography at the German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ) as a student of Molecular Biotechnology. As one of 30 other students she will start with the master of Molecular Biotechnology at the University of Heidelberg in October. The iGEM competition demonstrates a unique opportunity to organize a scientific project and to meet a young inspirational team of students.
Nao Iwamoto
Nao is a Master student of Cancer Biology at the German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ). During his Bachelor's program in Theoretical Biophysics at the Humboldt University to Berlin he gained his strong enthusiasm towards Systems Biology. Before joining the iGEM team Heidelberg '09 he worked as a student research assistant in the lab of Dr. Ursula Klingmüller (Systems Biology of Signal Transduction) at the DKFZ. Being a member of the iGEM team Heidelberg '09 he is looking forward to contributing to the exciting project on the theoretical side and is glad to share a wonderful summer with the students.
Stephen Krämer
Stephen has just finished his 4th semester as a student of Molecular Biotechnology at the University of Heidelberg. He believes that biology can contribute to solutions to major challenges of the 21st century like the growing water and food shortage in many regions of the world. But in his opinion modern biology will only unfold its full potential if it will be based on a systematic foundation. This is the reason why he is fascinated by the ideas of Synthetic Biology.
Hannah Meyer
Hannah has just started her fifth semester as a student of Molecular Biotechnology. In her second semester she has started working in the Tucker group at the university of Heidelberg where she has worked in the field of neurogenesis and nerve development. After having learned new methods in wet lab work, she is looking forward to bringing in her experiences but also to organizing and setting up own scientific projects. She is very excited to work in a new field of biology and hopes to have a great summer with the other team members!
Douaa Mugahid
Biology for a better life is what Douaa believes in. Coming from a country where the availability of food and better health care is always an issue for the masses, she believes that as a biologist who can use science for the help of better, cheaper industrial/agricultural/medical use she has a lot to give to her own country and the masses at large. For those reasons Douaa studies Biotechnology as an undergraduate, but being faced with the immense costs that people are faced with in that industry in general made her want to think of how to bring them down. In silico optimization of biological processes away from the workbench in the lab seemed like the best idea, which is why she is currently doing a masters in Systems Biology at Heidelberg University. Being part of the iGEM team this year makes her know that as biologists there is so much we can do that is creative, useful and eventually cost effective and widely available for all researchers all over the world.
Anne Rademacher
Anne also just finished her 4th semester of Molecular Biotechnology at Heidelberg University. Next to her studies she had worked in Faiza Rharbaoui's group at Cellzome for three semesters. Regarding iGEM she looks forward to a summer with students from different studies and a lot of fun experiencing a new field of biology.
Hannah Uckelmann
Hannah is a student in the second semester of the Molecular Biosciences Masters Program with the major Molecular and Cellular Biology at the University of Heidelberg. She completed her bachelors degree in biochemistry at the Florida A&M University in the states. She has experience in obesity and cancer research and hopes to be able to contribute greatly to the wet lab work in this years iGEM project. She is excited to work on this fascinating project with a great group of students!
Lars Velten
After finishing high school, Lars spent a year volunteering in Development Cooperation, selling solar power to Massai people in northern Tanzania. Perceiving plants as the better solar cell, and also interested in everything else (but urchins), he turned to study Molecular and Cellular Biology at Heidelberg U, where he has now finished his 4th semester. He collected some wetlab experience during an internship with Kartsten Weis' lab at UC Berkeley, where he worked on a project studying proteome turnover. He is looking foward to working in Synthetic Biology.
Bingqing Zhao
Bingqing just finished her medical study this July in Peking University, China. The five-year study and internships in different hospitals has taught her a lot in medicine. This as well aroused her special curiosity for congenital disorders. She will continue her study in major Developmental Biology of master program Molecular Bioscience in Heidelberg University. Earlier this year, she took an internship at Prof. Eils' group, focusing on promoter measurement with real-time RT-PCR technique. This experience leads her to the iGEM team Heidelberg 2009. She is looking forward to an exciting and passionate summer with all the team mates!
Chenchen Zhu
At present, Chenchen is a master student of Molecular Biosciences Major: Infectious disease. He had studied Informatics in China for one year. After half-year learning of German in Berlin, he moved to Heidelberg and furthered his study in Molecular Biotechnology for three years. His main interest is in microbiology, especially in the research of Hepatitis B Virus.

University
The University of Heidelberg, also called Ruprecht Karl University of Heidelberg, is the most ancient university of Germany. The University Heidelberg is one of the leading research university in Europe and is constantly ranked 1st or 2nd nationally. The excellent research is shown by the fact that 30 Nobel Prize laureates are associated with the University Heidelberg. The 12 faculties host over 26.000 students and about 4200 full-time staff members. Associated institutions like the German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), the European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL) and several Max-Planck institutes contribute to the excellent scientific reputation.
German Cancer Research Center
How do malignant tumours develop? In Germany, cancer, with over 450,000 new cases diagnosed and 270,000 deaths each year, is one of the most dreaded diseases and the second most frequent cause of death nation-wide. How can they be prevented or at least diagnosed at an early stage and treated more effectively? In recent years, tremendous effort has been invested in the fight against cancer and researchers at the German Cancer Research Center in Heidelberg have achieved major advances both in basic research and in the development of novel methods for clinical application. This has received special recognition in 2008, when Professor Harald zur Hausen was awarded the Nobel Prize for Medicine for his outstanding scientific contribution to the study of human papillomaviruses (HPV). Cutting-edge research for fighting against this threatening disease is performed here in Heidelberg by over 2000 scientific members, including professional researchers and students. The German Cancer Research Center (Deutsches Krebsforschungszentrum, DKFZ) is the largest biomedical research institute in Germany and is a member of the Helmholtz Association of National Research Centers. Besides its multi-faceted research focuses, the german cancer research provides a brilliant platform for scientists of the next generation by offering a Master's program in Cancer Biology in close cooperation with the University of Heidelberg as well as an internatinal Ph.D. program called the Helmholtz International Graduate School for Cancer Research.
BioQuant
The Bioquant is part of the University of Heidelberg and integrates groups from different disciplines to help them focus on their research tasks. Quantitative analyzes of biological processes is one of the important tasks that medicine and biology face in the post-genomic era. Those analyzes are very useful to understand fundamental mechanisms and their development and especially to get insights into disturbance and regulation of biological processes. In the medicine it will lead to improved diagnoses as well as therapies. It might also help to prevent new diseases from developing. Besides experimental accumulation of biological data and their analysis with bioinformatics, it is important to model and simulate these processes, primarily to validate experiments. The improvement of those methods and their expansion to more complex systems is the goal of Bioquant's research teams.
BioRegion RN
High-perfomance industry and a lot of outstanding research institutions
BioRegion Rhein-Neckar is one of Germany’s leading clusters and contains areas of three German States: Rheinland-Pfalz, Baden-Württemberg and Hessen. This cluster defines a combination of medicine, biotechnology and fundamental research to build up a major scientific and industrial region in Europe. Many important academic and industrial facilities are members of the BioRegion Rhein-Neckar (see member list). This region concentrates elite research in the range of molecular biology and molecular medicine. The University of Heidelberg, the European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL), the German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ) and the Max-Planck Institute for Medical Research are part of this scientific excellence. This is supplemented by the University of Mannheim and Kaiserslautern. Furthermore, the cities of Heidelberg, Ludwigshafen and Mannheim present an important industrial conurbation with key aspects of chemical industry and electrical and mechanical engineering. These include the companies Roche Diagnostics, BASF, Abbott, Merck, Baxter and Aventis Pasteur. The software company SAP and the financial service provider MLP are essential members of the service sector.

About Gabriel See
I am 11 years old and am officially a 7th Grader. However, I have a multi-tier education.
I am formally taking classes at the University of Washington in Mathematical Biology together with other Graduate Students and College Seniors as a non-matriculated student. I am also studying Electrodynamics (3rd year college physics) with my mentor, Dean Emeritus Ernest Henley .
I have spend my last 3 years at Eastlake High School , exhausted all AP level Math and Science courses, and received an AP Scholar with Distinction Award. This year, I am doing my 7th Grade at the Renaissance School of Arts and Reasoning taking Visual Arts (Drawing, Glass & other Medias), Performance Arts (Dance & Theatre), Language Arts and Social Studies.
Prior to working on iGEM, I have spent 3 years on the Eastlake HS Robotics Team, developing software for FRC (FIRST Robotics Competition), FTC (FIRST Technical Competition) and Robothon. I have also spend my last 3 years self-studying upper division College Science Courses (Nuclear Physics, Genetics, Molecular Biology) and Graduate Level Applied Math (Nonlinear Dynamics, Chaos Theory, Stochastic Processes) with various mentors. My mentors include Professors, Postdoctoral Fellows, Instructors from Graduate School and Heads of Research Labs (Pathology and Biochemistry).

CHU Tsz Long Nelson
I am entering my second year of biochemistry at HKU and i have a special interest in bio-gerontology. I join the igem2009 because i want to understand more about synthetic biology and to get some practical research experience. In my spare time i enjoy table tennis, archery and chess games. I hope to pursue my PhD program in the US after i graduate.
In this competition, I am responsible for biobrick construction and speed control. I learnt a lot of useful skills and hand-on experience of practical research. Though there were many failures, i managed to provide some possible explanations for the failures and discuss it with other teamates. I found myself addicted to scientific research after this competition. I hope I can be a successful scientist and contribute a lot to mankind in the future.
FU Zhong Zheng Brooks
Brooks Fu Zhongzheng is an undergraduate student at the University of Hong Kong majoring in Biochemistry and Physics. Aspired to be a successful biologist, he decides to choose these two majors to train himself in both analytical reasoning skills and the ability of filtering useful information. He thinks these are the most essential tool for a biologist to explore the profound mystery of life. It is quite challenging to deal with two subjects that are so different in thinking patterns and ways of preparing for the exam, but he manages to cope with ‘oscillating transition between physics and biology’ and attain satisfactory academic results. However, knowledge on the textbook is out-dated. Only will an opportunity of self-motivated scientific DIY suffice to provide him with a somehow more realistic perspective on state-of-the-art research.
When first introduced to the iGEM competition in a departmental seminar, he was totally fascinated by the idea of synthesizing ‘biological machines’ from standardized biological parts. This whole process of building up biological devices from basic functional building blocks will require mathematical modeling and a systematic and logical design that is familiar to engineering student. He thinks it is time to exploit the intricate principles discovered by so many talented scientists after centuries of dutiful research to engineer artificial organisms that can ‘change the world’ and help people. He was thus motivated to join the HKU-HKBU iGEM team. In this team, his responsibility is to generate ideas and design of the project and manufacture Biobricks, namely standardized biological parts. With enthusiasm and diligence, he collaborates with his talented teammates to create a powerful bacteria-powered motor. The argument that our future world will heavily rely on the motors we build may seem ridiculous to some. It may or may not happen, but who knows? Nothing is impossible. iGEM is for people with imagination.
iGEM is an invaluable learning experience for him. Thanks to the competition, he not only masters the necessary research skills in manipulating the genetic materials of bacteria, but more importantly, the spirit of teamwork and the importance of taking up responsibility.
JIANG Qin Qin
I’m a second year student studying Biochemistry and Chemistry at the University of HongKong. I have a strong interest in doing research and enjoy the process of trying new ideas. On the team I spent most of my time doing wet lab. Although I have been defeated for many trials, once I had positive results, a great sense of accomplishments made all the efforts worthy. Meanwhile, the variable possibilities in experiments display the fascination of synthetic biology. Another great thing is that I have met lots of like-minded friends in this IGEM competition. We exchanged our ideas, experienced failure and success together, which made us like a big family. Outside the lab, I’m an easy-going person with lots of interests. I usually do sports and go travelling in my spare time to relax myself.
LI Wei Han James
My name is Weihan Li, and I am a year 2 undergraduate student from the physics department of Hong Kong Baptist University. I have been an undergraduate research assistant, under the supervision of Prof Leihan Tang, in Condenced Matter Theory and Biophysics Lab for over 1 year and a half. My research mainly aimed at quantatively understanding biological processes, especially metabolism. Attending different conferences and symposiums on synthetic biology, system biology and physics also opened my eyes. I also had the honor to give a 20-minute academic repeort, titled Biological Network Analysis: on oscillation and synchronization, on the International Conference on Complexity and Disciplinary Sciences, which is an encouragement and also a good start for me. In this iGEM project, we worked as a team to realize our dreams to engineer something we always long for with the help of bacteria. I am glad to be a part of the team where I gained not only the knowledge and the valuable wet lab experience, but also the precious friendship. I believe this iGEM project will be a great treasure through out my life!
LI Yan Lin Jubi
hailing from Hong Kong, is a second-year undergraduate reading medicine and surgery. He joined the iGEM team primarily because he sees synthetic biology as a powerful tool for inventing novel therapeutic strategies.
He has thus far taken up three roles in the competition: firstly as fund-raising manager, then as group leader of the Che-Z knockout (2443ompT) team, and now as leader of the Human Practices Advance team. Moreover, as one of the only two clinicians around (alas!), he is also responsible for imagining – and developing – the potential clinical applications of the Bacto-Motor.
Outside medicine, his other academic interests include philosophy, politics and economics and he has represented both Hong Kong and HKU at international debating competitions, advancing to the Octo-Finals of the Worlds Schools Washington DC in 2008. He is also editor-in-chief of Caduceus, the official journal of the Undergraduate Medical Society. While not preoccupied by other tasks, he enjoys classical music, jogging, table tennis and banter – where everybody gets a good laugh :)
SHENG Zi Wei Amy
I am senior biology student of Hong Kong Baptist University. Mainly working on wet lab, I, together with teammates, take responsibility of measuring the swimming speed and categorizing the trait of polar expression after bacteria being modified. When James, one of our members, introduced me to this group, I had zero knowledge of what synthetic biology means or what we suppose to do. However, had gone through papers and handled wet lab work, I have started to understand the significance of this subject and its bright future and moreover exhibit great interest to it. I attained from this experience not only practical laboratory skills and knowledge of synthetic biology but also friendship and teamwork spirit. Other interests of mine include traveling, reading, growing vegetables and eating them.
SIN Sheung Man Alexander
When I first heard about iGEM and the idea of synthetic biology, it really caught my interest. This is a chance where I can combine other’s work and findings and make the best out of them. This is what I have learnt recently from object-orientated programming – breaking ideas down into objects, manipulating and assembling them into one working machine.
Being in the second year of the Bioinformatics Programme, I am in the middle of learning how the knowledge of computer science can be applied on biochemistry. By participating in the iGEM competition, one would be able to gain hands-on experience on what biochemistry research is like, how the knowledge learnt from lectures can be applied to practical laboratory work, and the wisdom to work as a team – sharing results, joys as well as deadlines and pressure. I am glad and honoured to be a part of the team HKU-HKBU, and it is a wonderful opportunity to be able to work with students from another university in Hong Kong.
TSE Kwong To Paul
I'm a second year student studying Chemistry at the University of Hong Kong. It is my first time to take part in an international competition about synthetic biology. After acquiring information from my other iGEM members, my strong interest drives me to participate into iGEM in summer. At the very beginning, I think this is just another means to kill my time in summer. However, after attending several meeting and assisting others to do different kinds of laboratory work, I find myself immersed in this competition. Some of the laboratory work like western blotting, PCR, electrophoresis and the like are very new to me and I never come across this stuff from Chemistry laboratory. Though repeated failure in the genes knockout, I never felt frustrated since I could learn new things from each failed experiment. Indeed, with the help of other iGEM members and supervisors, I acquire tremendous knowledge about the synthetic biology as well as biochemistry in this competition. My part of work in this iGEM competition is mainly dry lab, which include wikis work, human practice, some search for experiment stuff. Hoping our effort in this competition can pay off and earn the glory and reputation of HKU and HKBU.
WEI Ling
Hi, I’m WEI Ling, a student member of iGEM09 HKU-HKBU team. I come from Department of Physics, Hong Kong Baptist University, majoring in biophysics. I graduated from Beijing Normal University this summer. As a physics student, biology is totally new for me. Frankly speaking, it is the first time that I hear so many biology terminologies and deal with some simple manipulations. Fortunately, with the help of friendly and amusing team members, I have learnt a lot in the lab.
Thanks to all the pretty girls and handsome boys in our team. They bring so much fun during the little bit boring lab life. No matter what the final result of this competition is, I enjoy the course and cherish our friendship. I have to say that I LOVE YOU ALL!!!
Oh, by the way, although I’m interested in many things, songs of Westlife, movies of Leung Chiuwai, and also show of Lakers are my most favorite. If you are also their fans, please share your feelings and opinions with me. Thank you!
WONG Chi Kin Felix
I am an MBBS student with immense interest in research. By research I would like to find solutions for healthcare and make the world better. Seems my aspiration is a bit far away from the contents of our project? In fact, I am still trying to learn experimental technique. I believe doing any kinds of biological experiment can enrich my understanding in research routines and insights. Meanwhile, I am responsible for the Human Practices Project. By letting people know about synthetic biology, they understand how it can contribute to the advancement of quality of life.
I was a late comer in this team, since I joined in September. In these two months, I have become good friends with all my teammates. May I grasp this opportunity to say thank you to all of them.
WONG Ho Yin Bosco
Hi, my name is Bosco and i am a year 2 student at HKU reading biochemistry and chemistry. During these days working as a member in the HKU_HKBU team, i have learnt a lot about synthetic biology and yet made invaluable friendship from the other members.
I joined this competition not only for learning more about biochemistry, but also the essential lab skills that i need for my studies. Through these months conducting experiments in the lab and holding numerous meetings late, i am very surprised i have survived from all these.
Especially when some of the members went home and there were only few people here in hong kong, we have encountered a very great crisis in human resources. Yet, with all our keen devotion, we have resolved and learnt from problems to problems. I love the days being in the team and the days spent with my teammates, making fun of each other, hard working together without sleeping. Now i just wanna finish our current and can't wait to see us beating up the other teams at MIT (if we were able = =).
To be honest, actually i never emphasized i am the leader of the compeition. As i am a person who don;t want to make the other people shoulder a lot of pressure and i don't want think i am the person with good leading skills.
I just think of myself being a normal member and try to do my best. I know i am not a good leader at all but anyway i feel very grateful for those who gave me support and forgave my wrongdoings during the hard times.  I know i have said a chunk of stuff and i know it is clumsy. The last thing i wanna say is that i am very proud that i have spent time with my friends pursuing a dream during my most busy summer, pursuing a goal that to undergraduate students seems so far away and demanding yet it is the sweetest ,remarkable and memorable dream i have ever had in my life time.
I just love you all!
YIP Ka Ho Raymond
2nd Year biochemistry and microbiology student. Was studying in UK for several years before coming back to the homeland and join the big HKU family. After spending a year doing nothing, skipping lectures (switched onto the “sleep” mood even do appear) and resting, I finally picked myself up to get some work done by registering to the iGEM team. Being the one who is responsible for the BIG fund-raising job, human practices activities and others wet lab experiments for our team. I must say that was the busiest summer I have ever had but also the one which I truly enjoyed.
It was an honor for me to work with many hilarious, “hard-working” fellow geniuses. Especially those weekly meetings that end at mid-night, meals time which we make fun out of each other and when the swine flu suddenly hit our lab. Many and many more memorable moments that we shared together throughout the past few months were totally awesome and enjoyable. Hope we shall get some good results this year and ROCK THEM!
ZHANG Yi Nan
ZHONG Xing Xin Nova
I am a year 2 student from the Department of Mathematics of the University of  Hong Kong.  I joined the iGEM team of HKU-BU at the beginning of this summer, and feel great honored to join in the jamboree representing HKU.  As a mathematics students, I have never entered a Biochemistry lab before but  the experience this time has enlighten me a lot. Actually, iGEM is the first time for me to touch the concept of synthetic biology.
Working together with the whole team, under the guidance of instructors, I am able to see my progress day after day.  Those creative ideas in the brainstorm, rigorous spirit of setting controlling, and the ingenious designing of experiment have impressed me and changed my mind significantly.
During the summer, I mainly worked on controlling the speed  of our bacteria-motor, and on measuring the expressing level related to a concentration gradient of the IPTG inducer, by  the method of Western Blotting. Besides, I have tried on knocking out cheZ fragment of E.coli 2443 and spent some time in making bio-brick.
Generally, I have learned a lot in the iGEM and really enjoyed the project.
Student Helpers
XUE Yuan Soso
Yuan Xue is a senior high school student (graduating in 2010) currently pursuing study in La Salle Catholic College Preparatory located in Portland, Oregon. He developed an interest in the field of biology and chemistry after studying the corresponding courses at high school that soon attracted him to iGEM. After approximately two weeks of volunteering in a former iGEM project of iHKU team over the summer of 2008, he had an honor to pledge to working with university students as a HKU-HKBU team member this year in 2009. This precious opportunity gave him an insight into the application of principles of synthetic biology to contributing human welfare; furthermore, it inspired him to pursue further studies in the corresponding field of study as he found it to be intellectually provocative and intriguing.
He was assigned as a wet lab researcher tasked with activating the polar expression on Escherichia coli 2443 OMPT. His primary approach to tackling this task was transforming plasmids into 2443 OMPT. He learned a tremendous amounts of knowledge on regards to research techniques, data analysis, setting for experiments, and the mindset of research – to be both innovative and steadfast.

Brooks Fu Zhongzheng is a second year undergraduate student studying at the University of Hong Kong. Aspiring to be a successful researcher, he decided to choose biochemistry and physics as majors to train himself in reasoning skills and the ability of gleaning useful information from books as heavy as two bags of potatoes. He personally thinks knowledge of physics is indispensable for him to make sense of the abstruseness and intricacy of life.  It is quite challenging to deal with these two majors that require different thinking patterns and learning methods, but his brain manages to develop an ability of quickly switching between 'biology mode' and 'physics mode'. He really enjoys himself when learning and attains satisfactory academic results. In the spare time, he usually plays the piano to get relaxed. He is a big fan of Bach and Prokofiev.
It occurs to him that 'all textbooks no experiments will make Brooks a dull boy'. Only will an opportunity of self-motivated scientific 'DIY' enable him to internalize what he learn from the textbook. When first introduced to the iGEM competition by Dr.Huang, he was totally fascinated by the idea of assembling ‘biological machines’ using standardized biological parts. He thinks it is time to exploit the intricate principles discovered by so many talented scientists after centuries of dutiful research to engineer man-made organisms that can ‘change the world’ and help people. He was thus motivated to join the HKU-HKBU team. In the team, he devotes a lot of time to generating ideas,designing the project,editing the wiki and manufacturing Biobricks.

When I first heard about iGEM and the idea of synthetic biology, it really caught my interest. This is a chance where I can combine other’s work and findings and make the best out of them. This is what I have learnt recently from object-orientated programming – breaking ideas down into objects, manipulating and assembling them into one working machine.
Being in the second year of the Bioinformatics Programme, I am in the middle of learning how the knowledge of computer science can be applied on biochemistry. By participating in the iGEM competition, one would be able to gain hands-on experience on what biochemistry research is like, how the knowledge learnt from lectures can be applied to practical laboratory work, and the wisdom to work as a team – sharing results, joys as well as deadlines and pressure. I am glad and honoured to be a part of the team HKU-HKBU, and it is a wonderful opportunity to be able to work with students from another university in Hong Kong.
TSE Kwong To Paul
I'm a second year student studying Chemistry at the University of Hong Kong. It is my first time to take part in an international competition about synthetic biology. After acquiring information from my other iGEM members, my strong interest drives me to participate into iGEM in summer. At the very beginning, I think this is just another means to kill my time in summer. However, after attending several meeting and assisting others to do different kinds of laboratory work, I find myself immersed in this competition. Some of the laboratory work like western blotting, PCR, electrophoresis and the like are very new to me and I never come across this stuff from Chemistry laboratory. Though repeated failure in the genes knockout, I never felt frustrated since I could learn new things from each failed experiment. Indeed, with the help of other iGEM members and supervisors, I acquire tremendous knowledge about the synthetic biology as well as biochemistry in this competition. My part of work in this iGEM competition is mainly dry lab, which include wikis work, human practice, some search for experiment stuff. Hoping our effort in this competition can pay off and earn the glory and reputation of HKU and HKBU.
WEI Ling
Hi, I’m WEI Ling, a student member of iGEM09 HKU-HKBU team. I come from Department of Physics, Hong Kong Baptist University, majoring in biophysics. I graduated from Beijing Normal University this summer. As a physics student, biology is totally new for me. Frankly speaking, it is the first time that I hear so many biology terminologies and deal with some simple manipulations. Fortunately, with the help of friendly and amusing team members, I have learnt a lot in the lab.
Thanks to all the pretty girls and handsome boys in our team. They bring so much fun during the little bit boring lab life. No matter what the final result of this competition is, I enjoy the course and cherish our friendship. I have to say that I LOVE YOU ALL!!!
Oh, by the way, although I’m interested in many things, songs of Westlife, movies of Leung Chiuwai, and also show of Lakers are my most favorite. If you are also their fans, please share your feelings and opinions with me. Thank you!
WONG Chi Kin Felix
I am an MBBS student with immense interest in research. By research I would like to find solutions for healthcare and make the world better. Seems my aspiration is a bit far away from the contents of our project? In fact, I am still trying to learn experimental technique. I believe doing any kinds of biological experiment can enrich my understanding in research routines and insights. Meanwhile, I am responsible for the Human Practices Project. By letting people know about synthetic biology, they understand how it can contribute to the advancement of quality of life.
I was a late comer in this team, since I joined in September. In these two months, I have become good friends with all my teammates. May I grasp this opportunity to say thank you to all of them.
WONG Ho Yin Bosco
Hi, my name is Bosco and i am a year 2 student at HKU reading biochemistry and chemistry. During these days working as a member in the HKU_HKBU team, i have learnt a lot about synthetic biology and yet made invaluable friendship from the other members.
I joined this competition not only for learning more about biochemistry, but also the essential lab skills that i need for my studies. Through these months conducting experiments in the lab and holding numerous meetings late, i am very surprised i have survived from all these.
Especially when some of the members went home and there were only few people here in hong kong, we have encountered a very great crisis in human resources. Yet, with all our keen devotion, we have resolved and learnt from problems to problems. I love the days being in the team and the days spent with my teammates, making fun of each other, hard working together without sleeping. Now i just wanna finish our current and can't wait to see us beating up the other teams at MIT (if we were able = =).
To be honest, actually i never emphasized i am the leader of the compeition. As i am a person who don;t want to make the other people shoulder a lot of pressure and i don't want think i am the person with good leading skills.
I just think of myself being a normal member and try to do my best. I know i am not a good leader at all but anyway i feel very grateful for those who gave me support and forgave my wrongdoings during the hard times.  I know i have said a chunk of stuff and i know it is clumsy. The last thing i wanna say is that i am very proud that i have spent time with my friends pursuing a dream during my most busy summer, pursuing a goal that to undergraduate students seems so far away and demanding yet it is the sweetest ,remarkable and memorable dream i have ever had in my life time.
I just love you all!
YIP Ka Ho Raymond
2nd Year biochemistry and microbiology student. Was studying in UK for several years before coming back to the homeland and join the big HKU family. After spending a year doing nothing, skipping lectures (switched onto the “sleep” mood even do appear) and resting, I finally picked myself up to get some work done by registering to the iGEM team. Being the one who is responsible for the BIG fund-raising job, human practices activities and others wet lab experiments for our team. I must say that was the busiest summer I have ever had but also the one which I truly enjoyed.
It was an honor for me to work with many hilarious, “hard-working” fellow geniuses. Especially those weekly meetings that end at mid-night, meals time which we make fun out of each other and when the swine flu suddenly hit our lab. Many and many more memorable moments that we shared together throughout the past few months were totally awesome and enjoyable. Hope we shall get some good results this year and ROCK THEM!
ZHANG Yi Nan
I am a second-year undergraduate at the University of Hong Kong majoring in bioinformatics, which is really a combination of two majors - in biochemistry and computer science. Being one of the earliest members of our team, I was responsible for writing and presenting our project proposal at the beginning, some wet lab experiments in the middle, and at last, perhaps the one I enjoyed most, our wiki's build-up work. Specifically, I converted our first two framework designs into code, though not the final one. It seemed to be quite a hard job for me at first since I started out as a complete newbie, even without knowing any HTML tags but only some if and while statements in programming languages such as C. However, driven by a burning curiosity in the field of web coding, I decided to give it a try and studied some HTML, CSS, and JavaScript online tutorials myself, and then embarked on an exciting journey of constructing my very first website. And I found it never less amazing than working with those traditional programming languages!
Besides coding, I also enjoyed undergoing the entire process of a scientific project as well as learning a bunch of basic wet lab techniques. And yet the thing I treasure most is the friendship with other team mates I have harvested. It has been a really nice experience to work with people with different backgrounds and distinct characters, from both HKU and HKBU. We had such a great time together in the past couple of months. We strived together, laughed together, and faced challenges together. I will never forget the time we spent together.
ZHONG Xing Xin Nova
I am a year 2 student from the Department of Mathematics of the University of  Hong Kong.  I joined the iGEM team of HKU-BU at the beginning of this summer, and feel great honored to join in the jamboree representing HKU.  As a mathematics students, I have never entered a Biochemistry lab before but  the experience this time has enlighten me a lot. Actually, iGEM is the first time for me to touch the concept of synthetic biology.
Working together with the whole team, under the guidance of instructors, I am able to see my progress day after day.  Those creative ideas in the brainstorm, rigorous spirit of setting controlling, and the ingenious designing of experiment have impressed me and changed my mind significantly.
During the summer, I mainly worked on controlling the speed  of our bacteria-motor, and on measuring the expressing level related to a concentration gradient of the IPTG inducer, by  the method of Western Blotting. Besides, I have tried on knocking out cheZ fragment of E.coli 2443 and spent some time in making bio-brick.
Generally, I have learned a lot in the iGEM and really enjoyed the project.
Student Helper
XUE Yuan Soso
Yuan Xue is a senior high school student (graduating in 2010) currently pursuing study in La Salle Catholic College Preparatory located in Portland, Oregon. He developed an interest in the field of biology and chemistry after studying the corresponding courses at high school that soon attracted him to iGEM. After approximately two weeks of volunteering in a former iGEM project of iHKU team over the summer of 2008, he had an honor to pledge to working with university students as a HKU-HKBU team member this year in 2009. This precious opportunity gave him an insight into the application of principles of synthetic biology to contributing human welfare; furthermore, it inspired him to pursue further studies in the corresponding field of study as he found it to be intellectually provocative and intriguing.
He was assigned as a wet lab researcher tasked with activating the polar expression on Escherichia coli 2443 OMPT. His primary approach to tackling this task was transforming plasmids into 2443 OMPT. He learned a tremendous amounts of knowledge on regards to research techniques, data analysis, setting for experiments, and the mindset of research – to be both innovative and steadfast.

About USTC_Software
A bunch of energetic young guys bumping into each other in pursuit of the truth of life, and this is basically the essential reason why we are here now.
This year, we are much more populated than before. This not only gets solid proof from the increasing coverage of participants' number, but also can be demonstrsted by the big variance among participants' backgrounds. The 2009 iGEM team of USTC, well, if we just count the dry team, consists of two graduate students and four undergraduates. Our major varies from  electrnic engineering to condensed matter physics, from geophysics to computational biology. By such a colorful combination, anything exciting could be possible relying on our brotherhood. We feel so lucky to get acquaintance with each other and really enjoy all the funny days we are together. We will enjoy the days in MIT, just join us!

About USTC_Software
A bunch of energetic young guys bumping into each other in pursuit of the truth of life, and this is basically the essential reason why we are here now.
This year, we are much more populated than before. This not only gets solid proof from the increasing coverage of participants' number, but also can be demonstrsted by the big variance among participants' backgrounds. The 2009 iGEM team of USTC, well, if we just count the dry team, consists of two graduate students and four undergraduates. Our major varies from  electrnic engineering to condensed matter physics, from geophysics to computational biology. By such a colorful combination, anything exciting could be possible relying on our brotherhood. We feel so lucky to get acquaintance with each other and really enjoy all the funny days we are together. We will enjoy the days in MIT, just join us!

We have FUN!
iGEM is fun! And even when the 'wetness' is drained, fun remains the same for 'dryness'. We and the USTC wet team work together to help find inspirations and fun. Here follows snapshots of those happy moments.

Team Description
We work together, create together, have fun together, persue dream together! What we have is passoin and courage, what we pursue is challenge and creation. We are a family more than a team, we are brothers and sisters more than schoolmates!
We will keep every single laughter in mind as well as dismay and frustration. We miss those days when heated discussion took place to determine proceeding plans and those nights when we repeat experiments to figure out puzzles. What we finally get is much more than the project E.ADEM, but friendship, courage, strength and happiness.

Besides being a student city, Groningen is also ahead in the areas of research, innovation and entrepreneurship: a real city of talent. In order to make this known to the rest of the Netherlands, University of Groningen, Hanze University Groningen, the UMCG University Medical Center Groningen and the Province and municipality of Groningen have joined forces. Under the common denominator of ‘Groningen, City of Talent’, in conjunction with Marketing Groningen, they have started a national campaign under the motto of: ‘Here is space for talent. Space for learning, for working and for growing. For further personal development and making the best of yourself. And there is room for living, sports and entertainment. There’s no place like Groningen.’
The Centre for Synthetic Biology (CSB) is a multi-institution effort of the University of Groningen to forge research expertise in the emerging field of synthetic biology.

What We Did
This year Tsinghua iGEM team works on a human practice based approach to contructing a targeted gene therapy vector. In order to synthesize a targeted gene therapy vector with as more advantages as possible, we conducted several brainstorming meetings and finalized our whole project design via synthetic genome approach.
Furthermore, we hope our designed targeted gene therapy vector accords with the standards of BioBricks, so that it can be further explored by future research. Thus, we designed, constructed and characterized a BioBrick composed of cell-specific peptide, adenovirus fiber shaft and RGD domain, which we termed Targeted BioBrick .

About Tsinghua
Tsinghua University was established in 1911, originally under the name “Tsinghua Xuetang”. The school was renamed ""Tsinghua School"" in 1912. The university section was founded in 1925. The name “National Tsinghua University” was adopted in 1928.
The faculty greatly valued the interaction between Chinese and Western cultures, the sciences and humanities, the ancient and modern. Tsinghua scholars Wang Guowei, Liang Qichao, Chen Yinque and Zhao Yuanren, renowned as the ""Four Tutors"" in the Institute of Chinese Classics, advocated this belief and had a profound impact on Tsinghua's later development.
Tsinghua University was forced to move to Kunming and join with Peking University and Nankai University to form the Southwest Associated University due to the Resistance War against the Japanese Invasion in 1937. In 1946 The University was moved back to its original location in Beijing after the war.
After the founding of the People's Republic of China, the University was molded into a polytechnic institute focusing on engineering in the nationwide restructuring of universities and colleges undertaken in 1952. In November 1952, Mr. Jiang Nanxiang became the President of the University. He made significant contributions in leading Tsinghua to become the national center for training engineers and scientists with both professional proficiency and personal integrity.
Since China opened up to the world in 1978, Tsinghua University has developed at a breathtaking pace into a comprehensive research university. At present, the university has 14 schools and 56 departments with faculties in science, engineering, humanities, law, medicine, history, philosophy, economics, management, education and art. The University has now over 25,900 students, including 13,100 undergraduates and 12,800 graduate students. As one of China’s most renowned universities, Tsinghua has become an important institution for fostering talent and scientific research.
The educational philosophy of Tsinghua is to ""train students with integrity."" Among over 120,000 students who have graduated from Tsinghua since its founding are many outstanding scholars, eminent entrepreneurs and great statesmen remembered and respected by their fellow Chinese citizens.
With the motto of “Self-Discipline and Social Commitment” and the spirit of “Actions Speak Louder than Words”, Tsinghua University is dedicated to the well-being of Chinese society and to world development.
Inter-Team Activity
Mary Yang, who is also a member of the Stanford iGEM09 team, went to Stanford University for an internship with Stanford iGEM09 working on modeling. Their project is about immuno-balance.

From 2009.igem.org
Advisors
Prof. Brian Pfleger
My research interests lie in developing microorganisms capable of producing small molecules of significant social, economic, and scientific value from renewable resources. In the past decades, the field of biotechnology has blossomed to allow the production of valuable proteins including restriction enzymes, polymerases, blood factors, antibodies, and other therapeutic enzymes at industrial scale and cost. Recent work has shifted towards the production of small therapeutic molecules that are difficult to synthesize de novo due to their complexity. The high value ($ per molecule) of these chemicals allows for an economically viable process to be designed using today's technologies. In the coming decades, our economy will need to be based on renewable resources in order to sustain itself. As such, the chemical industry will need to discover renewable sources for its specialty chemicals and materials that are currently derived from fossil fuels. To reach such ends, my research group will develop new tools for engineering biological systems and explore the world of protein engineering in order to develop new biological catalysts for essential chemical reactions. It is my goal to develop a leading laboratory in the field of Synthetic Biology in order to harness the growing database of biological parts for use in developing novel technologies for chemical synthesis.

Prof. Doug Weibel
Our laboratory studies microbial biochemistry with an emphasis on understanding the molecular mechanisms that give rise to phenotypes in bacteria.  Although our current understanding of the complexity of a bacterium is still emerging, it is becoming clear that the genetic and biochemical mechanisms that govern cellular homeostasis are far more sophisticated than we had imagined.  Our approach to the study of bacteria is driven by the development of new capabilities for studying single cells or small groups of cells and the application of these techniques to dissect the molecular choreography within the cell.  This research is interdisciplinary and is based on a fusion of techniques from biology, physics, engineering, and chemistry.
[ back ]
Prof. Jennie Reed
Systems biology utilizes both experimental and computational approaches to study biological networks at a systems or whole network level, in order to understand and predict cellular behavior. Computational efforts need to be able to account qualitatively and quantitatively for a wide range of different data types relevant to biological systems. Most of my research group's interests involve the study of metabolism and regulation through the generation and subsequent analysis of metabolic models and reconciliation with experimental data. Overall, my group uses computational models and develops methods to study biological systems, engineer cells, and expand our knowledge of the underlying mechanisms behind observed cellular behavior.

ENGINEERING HALL
This is where we work!
Engineering Hall is commonly referred to as EHall on campus. It is host to a wide array of engineering classes and labs. The mall in front of the building is popular hang out area for engineering students and is a nice place to eat lunch in the summer. Starting this year, our team is working in the new Wisconsin iGEM Lab! Now all Wisconsin iGEM Teams will have their own lab on campus.
UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN - MADISON
The UW-Madison campus is settled in the downtown area of Madison, Wisconsin and wedged between the two glacial lakes Mendota and Monona. Madison is the flagship school of the Wisconsin State University System and currently enrolls 42,000 students. The school is one of the US’s largest scientific research schools and is a member of the Big Ten Conference. Learn more about our university at our Wikipedia Page .
Our school is privileged to have James Thomson on campus as a professor and researcher. In 1998,  Thomson was the first to isolate and culture human embryonic stem cells and has been on the forefront of development in the field ever since. To learn more about his work, visit his Lab’s Website .
Have you ever read The Onion?  The Onion was founded by Tim Keck and Christopher Johnson, two UW-Madison students, in 1988. Watch and read funny and satirical(fake) news on their Official website .
UW Madison has been known for Student Activism. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, UW-Madison was shaken by a series of student protests, and by the use of force by authorities in response, comprehensively documented in the film The War at Home. To this day UW-Madison students are very politically oriented and have given our school a reputation of activism.
Environmentalism would have never been the same without UW-Madison. John Muir took his first botany lesson at UW-Madison. His writings and philosophy strongly influenced the formation of the modern environmental movement, which UW-Madison strongly supports. Learn more about our Environmental Initiatives .

Anna Linhardt Hansen
Anna Hansen.
I am studying medicine on 5th semester at the University of Southern Denmark, and my motivation for joining SDU´s iGEM is numerous. First of all, studying medicine does not prepare the ground for scientific work, which I think is a petty. Second, I think its cool to make friends among different field of study. Third, but presumably most important; I would like to have some fun.
Julius Fredens
Julius Fredens aka Mr. Misty Forrest Dragon
I’m 24 and study Biochemistry and Molecular Biology at 9th semester. Although I've spend a lot of time in the lab doing projects on C. elegans metabolism and analysis of modified nerve terminal proteins, I've never been in touch with genetic engineering or even worked with single-celled organisms.
When I think about all the opportunities in genetic manipulation, I just have to know the techniques. And learning this discipline by hands-on experiences together with a great team – in competition with others ;o) – sounds just pretty nice!
Kir Jacobsen
Kir Jacobsen.
9th semester Biochemistry & Molecular biology, 24, experience with cell culturing, protein purification with focus on phosphoproteins and mass spectrometry. Additionally, experience with purification of DNA from tissue and copy number surveillance.
I always seek new areas of study, because I find the world of life sciences very exciting. When the opportunity came up to do something with bacteria, I was interested right from the start, because I havent really worked in the area of prokaryotes before and I was eager to explore it.
John Claesson
John Claesson.
Hey! My name is John. I am studying medicine at 5th semester here at the University of Southern Denmark. I have 3 reasons for joining the iGEM team here. First of all I'm very dedicated to all forms of science.  Second I think it is great to meet other students who have the same passion for science. At last I would also like to have more fun. :-)
Anne Zebitz Eriksen
Anne Zebitz Eriksen.
I am 20 years old and I have just finished my first year of the nanobioscience bachelor.  I have great experience in project-management from the technical high school, but have very little previous experience with the microbiology lab.
I joined the iGEM team because I always thought genetically engineering to be exciting and to gain valuable experience in this line of work. And mostly because it sounds fun.
Marc Trunjer Kusk Nielsen
Marc Trunjer Kusk Nielsen.
My name is Marc, im 21 years old and i've just finished the 3rd semester of Medicine. I have a broad, but superficial experience in labwork, but it's been a couple of years, and i miss it. Im really looking forward to retaking the lab and building a Staph dissolving bastard of a bacteria :)
Helle Bogetofte Thomasen
Helle Bogetofte Thomasen.
My name is Helle Bogetofte Thomasen, I am 23 years old and have just begun on my 6th semester of medicin at SDU.
Regarding my motivation; I generally think that syntetic biology is a very interesting scientific field with great potentiel and I really look forward to joining the competition and meeting students from all over the world.
I would like to work in medical research later on but our education doesn't really involve any lab work. So for me this iGEM project is also a great chance to get some lab experience and try some things that I would otherwise only read about. Beside from this I am strangely fascinated by bacteria ;o)
Mike Barnkob
Mike Barnkob.
Motivation: I found synthetic biology to be an exciting new field to explore. It has a lot of potential for real world applications and iGEM provides a perfect setup for us students to wrestle with new ideas and projects.
About me: I study medicine and am currently on my 7th semester here at SDU. I've worked on detecting LOH in a rare cancer called multiple self-healing squamous epithelioma at Odense University Hospital and spent some time at University of Illinois a summer ago trying to be helpful at Kelly Tappendens lab. My bachelor thesis had the inspiring name: A Systematic Comparison of Cystatin C Based Formula's and The Creatinin Based Schwartz Formula for Determining Kidney Functions in Children.

Ann Zahle Andersen.
I am a post.doc at the microbiology group of the department of biochemistry and molecular biology at SDU. I have a past I systems biology and mathematical modeling, but am currently researching in the field of food microbiology.
I was introduced to the iGEM team in May and immediately saw great potential. Therefore I am truly honored to be an instructor on their project and look forward to lots of fun and good science over the summer.
Pia K. Nielsen
Pia K. Nielsen.
Ph.D fellow at the University of Southern Denmark, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Odense.
When presented with the “International Genetically Engineered Machine” project, I first imagined it as an immense and boundless project.  But presented with the idea that the SDU-Denmark team had come up with, I became fascinated – could it be possible that they could generate a biological system, which could end up having a huge affect on the treatment of bacterial infection, just by an idea, some parts and a few months?
As pathogenesis and stress tolerance are main topics of my own research project, in which I am focusing on the virulence and stress response of Listeria monocytogenes, I use many of the molecular methods that the iGEM team are working with. Therefore I am very pleased to have the opportunity to help our team by assisting them in the lab.
Martin Hanczyc
Martin Hanczyc.
Synthetic Biology presents an interesting challenge to apply reliable protocols from molecular biology to alter and control the functionality of complex living systems.  The results of such endeavors are far from predictable and give scientists a realistic perspective on the interconnectivity, programmability, and complexity of living systems.  This is an exciting time for students interested in living systems to try to reprogram them in specific and quantifiable ways.
As an associate professor at SDU, I am primarily interested in developing laboratory models of complex systems that have life like properties.  This is done through my participation in the research center called FLinT (fundamental living technology).  Currently my research lies in physics and chemistry, but my interests are based in biology and evolution.
The team of students here came together under common interest, self organized and effectively initiated training in Synthetic Biology at SDU.  It is a pleasure for me to support their initiative, energy and curiosity.
Jakob Møller-Jensen
Jakob Møller-Jensen.
Associate Professor, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Southern Denmark.
I am interested in the molecular mechanisms by which pathogenic strains of Escherichia coli cause disease. In my group, we aim to identify bacterial virulence factors and further characterize the molecular cross-talk taking place at the host-pathogen interface during infection. In this framework the C. elegans model organism is used extensively for both genetic and proteomic analyses of bacterial infection.
As a supporter throughout the summer I have become truly impressed by the SDU iGEM team enthusiasm and genuine interest in science. They really make things happen, both in the lab and outside!
Steen Rasmussen
Steen Rasmussen.
Center Director and Professor at the Center for Fundamental Living Technology (FLinT), Department for Physics & Chemistry, University of Southern Denmark and External Research Professor at the Santa Fe Institute, New Mexico, USA.
I've been obsessed with the idea of assembling minimal from the bottom up since I was a student, and it's therefore a great pleasure for me to support our iGEM team.  iGEM is operating in the other end of Synthetic Biology also addressing ""what is life?"", but from the top down through modifying and simplifying existing life-forms.
Perhaps as the field of Synthetic Biology matures, iGEM 3.0 will also include a competition for teams developing minimal life-like systems from the bottom up: minimal molecular aggregate motility; minimal energy transduction systems; autonomous sensing signal transduction and actuation systems; aggregate growth and division; evolution in minimal replicator systems, and the like.
Birgitte Kallipolitis
Birgitte Kallipolitis.
Associate Professor in Molecular Microbiology at the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Southern Denmark.
Research interests: RNA- and protein-based gene regulatory systems in pathogenic bacteria; host-pathogen interactions; bacterial stress response; antibiotic resistance. Since 2005, principal investigator and head of research group currently consisting of 2 post docs, 4 phd students and several masters students. Research projects are currently funded by the Danish Council for Strategic Research, the Danish Natural Science Research Foundation, FORCE Technology and Luncbeckfonden.
Motivation: Always happy to support students with an interest in doing science!

Students
Anna Hallerbach
Hej, I am Anna from Germany. Before coming to Göteborg and studying Bioinformatics I have studied Cognitive Science in Osnabrück... After the election this year I decided not to go back to Germany to live... In my spare time I enjoy listening to music and running for clearing my head...
Naser Monsefi
My name is Naser Monsefi and I am from Iran. I got my BS in Cellular Molecular Biology from Shiraz University in year  2003.I joined the master program in systems biology at Götebörg University year 2008; which is still ongoing. I am already working on model-driven discovery of anticancer drug combinations beside iGEM competition.
Tabassum Farzana Jahan
Hi I am Tabassum. I am from Bangladesh and I have studied Computer Science in Bachelors. Currently I am in Chalmers University of Technology pursuing Bioinformatics degree. I love finding about new things, and doing something different, otherwise life would be boring. About IGEM, I felt it is something really different from my field, so why not explore it too.
Laleh Kazemzadeh
Hi.I'm Laleh from Iran.I got my bachelor in software engineering but I was more curious about application of engineering in medicine so I joined Bioinformatics program at Chalmers University in 2008.Historical places,nature and music are my top 3 interests... There was no idea better than joining iGem if I wanted to have fun while I felt being effective specially during long days summer and I m soooo happy that I did it.
M.Intakhar Ahmad
I am Intakhar Ahmad.I have previously studied Microbiology .Now, I am doing my MS degree in Systems Biology .I love to imagine new biological parts, devices, and systems.Actually ,it was my boyhood dream  which developed watching lots of science fiction movies.Couple of months back,an editorial in Nature (June,2007) boosted my fascination to Synthetic Biology.But...I always consider  the ethical obligations in the realm of Synthetic Biology.
Mohammad Tanvir Ahamed
Me Tanvir , completed my bachelor in Applied Statistics and doing MS in Bioinformatics at Chalmers. My study interest is focused mainly on two areas of statistics. Survival Analysis is one of them. Recently, statistics is being used extensively in areas of genetics and there are ample scope of contribution only to enrich the study of human genetics. This has been my motivation to study in Bioinformatics.
Fahim Mahmudur Rahman
Hey, This is Fahim from Bangladesh.My background is in computer science but currently i am exploring the world of bioinformatics. I love animes, songs, movies and sometimes books. Biology is something that fascinates and confuses me. I love both the feeling and thats why i joined IGEM.
Mao Tiezheng
Tiezheng Mao or Mao in short. I am from China major in Bioinformatics and Systems Biology, second year.  I choose this master program because it makes me exciting.  That is also why I join the iGEM Team Sweden.  I am interested in drug design and looking for the master thesis.

The
Schueller Bettencourt Fondation
was created by Mrs Liliane Schueller Bettencourt and her family, in the memory of her father Eugene Schueller, founder of L’Oréal. It helps to initiate, support and develop projects in the medical, cultural and humanitarian fields.
The foundation is active in the following areas:
• Medical research : The foundation supports the research through two types of actions : the assistance to the researchers and the support for the education (as example the foundation generously supports the FdV-Liliane Bettencourt PhD program).
• Culture : The foundation supports talented artists or craftsmen and attempts to make known or to acknowledge works of great quality, whether from the past or present.
• Social/humanitarian relief : It really important for the Foundation to provide help for associations that are  engaged in social and humanitarian actions. Through these, it contributes to relieve particularly difficult situations and to give new opportunities to children and adults in adversity.
Embassy of France in Washington
Since the begining of the parisian iGEM adventure, embassy of France in Washington supports our team. Through this action, the ambassy would like to promote the ""french science"" out of France and wants to improve the mobility/the intelectual development of young (and motivated) researchers .
In 1778, Louis XVI decided to create at the Hôtel des Monnaies (the Mint) ""a Chair of mineralogy and metallurgical docimasy, in which the professor appointed by the King will give free public lessons in this science"".     Since 1946 a foundation was created, the FI3M foundation of the
Mines Paristech
school supported by the graduate students of this school was created.    This association has to promote the high quality of the school all around the world, and to maintain the school at its bests level. To perform these mission, FI3M play an important role in different domains such as:
• Social and administrative support for the students
• Support for the foreign students and for the international policy of the school
• Support for fundamental research
• Support for real-estate projects or projects connected to the heritage of the School
INRIA, the French national institute for research in computer science and control, operating under the dual authority of the Ministry of Research and the Ministry of Industry, is dedicated to fundamental and applied research in information and communication science and technology (ICST). The Institute also plays a major role in technology transfer by fostering training through research, diffusion of scientific and technical information, development, as well as providing expert advice and participating in international programs.     By playing a leading role in the scientific community in the field and being in close contact with industry, INRIA is a major participant in the development of ICST in France.   The Institute's strategy closely combines scientific excellence with technology transfer. INRIA's major goal for 2008-2012 is to achieve scientific and technological breakthroughs in seven priority domains:
•Modelling, simulation and optimisation of complex dynamic systems
•Programming: security and reliability of computing systems
•Communication, information, and ubiquitous computing
•Interaction with real and virtual worlds
•Computational engineering
•Computational sciences
•Computational medicine
In close collaboration with the world of health since its creation in 2002, the mission of
EchoSens
is to provide the medical field with new global diagnostic solutions.    The mission of EchoSens is to offer hepatologists an ergonomic environment that generates and organises the clinical data necessary for the physician to make diagnoses and provide therapeutic treatment to patients.    EchoSens is currently a world leader in the field of transient elastography, after the success of a first in vivo device sold worldwide, the FibroScan® and its dedicated probes.
Thirty-five people contribute by their knowledge and expertise in an organisation centred around three main areas of activity:
• Health This area is focused on providing physicians with a panel of tools and services in order to facilitate their daily work.
• System This area is focused on fully managing the development of product, the integration of the technology as recycling and after-sales service.
• Laboratory It is in the laboratory that the most innovative ideas for developing new device with the most advanced technology are developed.
New England Biolabs
is dedicated to providing research products of the highest purity to the worldwide scientific community and supports this dedication with extensive quality control testing, a commitment to customer service and an intensive research and development program.    At NEB, basic research is a priority. Well established in their respective fields, including Molecular Biology and Parasitology, NEB scientists routinely publish their work in the leading journals, present research at scientific conferences, host visiting scholars from around the world, and supervise post-doctoral fellows. To date, over 630 papers have been published by NEB scientists, in addition to many patents that have been received.     NEB also offer a number of summer internships to undergraduate students as well as year round internships to local high school students.
Scientific contributors
We are particularily grateful to Dr. Roland Lloubes (CNRS - Institut de Microbiologie de la Méditerranée). He kindly provided us with his genetic constructs to destabilize the E. coli's outer-membrane (even twice, due to a poor mail reception service at the Cochin Institute where we are based). He was also very helpful in answering our questions regarding membrane stability and its links with the Tol/Pal system.
We would also like to thanks Pr. Volkmar Braun and Dr. Silke Patzer for providing some plasmids and advices on the Fec transduction system
We deeply regret that we do not had the chance to thanks Dr. Matthew DeLisa because he DID NOT WANT TO SHARE his published plasmids containing clyA-GFP fusion. We don't think this to be a good scientific endeavor...
People at the Interdisciplinary Research Center (CRI)
The Center for Research and Interdisciplinarity provides us with a scientific atmosphere and physical location to brainstorm, define and concretize our project as well as lab facilities within the Evolutionary Systems Biology team of the U571 INSERM Unit.  Special thanks a lot to
Ariel Lindner
Samuel Bottani

Where we are
Located 5 minutes walk from the Luxembourg Gardens at the Paris Descartes Medicine Faculty in Cochin, the Centre for Research and Interdisciplinarity CRI was founded in 2005 as a convivial place at the crossroad between Life Sciences and exact, natural, cognitive and social sciences. Our environment includes a fully-equipped seminar room, a meeting room, office space for visiting professors, a library and coffee rooms and a modelling as well as wet-lab space. The CRI supported its students over three years ago to form the first French team to the iGEM and the tradition is continuing... This is where all happened!
Student Team
Christophe Chabbert
Mathematics, Mines Paris Tech
AKA ""Colonel Chabbert"", he is our specialist in modelling especially for an ""easy/ordinary"" delay system. He likes sciences (really ?? ), his iGEM co-workers ;-), pizzas, burger and ... wait for it .... Coca-cola
Caroline Loy
Biology, Master 1 AIV
After 3 months as a cow-girl in the middle of nowhere (Scotland), she decided to make animal experimentation on bacteria =D
Romain Bodinier
Biology, UTC
Still wondering why he is here ... (Is he looking for a new bacto-foot after the lost of his left one ???). But he represented the last hope for the team, because with Luc, they were the only survivors to maintain the Lab Work during September and October !
Soufiane Boumahdi
Biochemistry, Insa Lyon
Every team needs to have ""panem et circenses"", Soufifi is here for entertaining us. Be careful for the jamboree, The crazy singer is coming !!! stay close to him and you will understand.... hoo year you will.

Our Obiwan Kenoby of the lab (without the laser saber)!!!
Stoff's note : i may say that she is more like princess Leyla :D
Guillaume Beauclair
Biology/Infectiology, Paris 7
Labholic --> working too hard could be dangerous for your health (too much vegetables also). Our 20hour/day lab worker
Sara Aguiton
Social Studies of Science, EHESS
Please, use simple ethical words when you are talking to a scientist assembly ;-)
Christophe Richard
Biology/Informatics, Master AIW
AKA ""Bibi"", he can talk to computer (Respect !!!!) but not to iPhone ... what a shame for an iPhone developer
Luc Malfondet
Physics/ Nanotechnology & Nanobioscience Master 2 AIV
Open-minded guy !!!!!

Ariel Lindner
Co-initiator of the Centre for Research and Interdisciplinarity (cri-paris.org), Ariel is an INSERM tenured senior researcher and director of the Interdisciplinary Approaches to Life Sciences ('AIV') master program at the Paris Descartes and Diderot Universities. Ariel has graduated from the Hebrew University (Jerusalem, Israel) ""Amirim"" interdisciplinary program with major in Chemistry and received his M.Sc. and Ph.D. from the Weizmann Institute of Science (Rehovot, Israel) in Chemical Immunology for his work on catalytic antibodies as enzyme models, antibody conformational changes and directed evolution. After a research period at the Scripps Institute (California, USA), he received EMBO and Marie Curie fellowships to pursue postdoctoral work in Paris. His study interests evolve around applying Physical, Chemical and Biological approaches to study aging and variability between clonal individuals. Ariel has been leading the Paris iGEM team since its conception over three years ago and cannot wait to bring another trophy home...
Samuel Bottani
Physicist
Trained as a physicist, natural evolution made me shift from cosmology to molecular biology. I'm interested in a variety of  scientific issues and their applications.  I'm inspired by beauty and how forms, behaviors and ideas emerge and this drives me in my explorations of the wonders on Nature. Primarily how complex structures and behavior emerge and evolve. We are in an extraordinary period where never so many details have been known on living organisms. Whole genomes are known and extraordinary technological advances enable in vivo tracking and action on single cells and molecules. There is the feeling that a new level of understanding of Life is about to be gained, with fantastic potential for the evolution of humanity. I am eager to participate to endeavor  and  by my research and critical thinking.  It is my opinion that scientists, as highly and costly educated citizens have social duty for the collectivity. Engagement in education is essential, ethical concern and involvement in technological and business matters for the benefit of all.  I am co-director of the international Ph.D. program ""Frontières du Vivant"" (Frontiers in Life Sciences, www.fdv-paris.org) of the Universities Paris Descartes and Paris Diderot for interdisciplinary research programs on Life Sciences issues. Hosted at the  Centre for Research and Interdisciplinarity (cri-paris.org) as the IGEM Paris team  we support active approaches in education for interdisciplinary research.
François Le Fèvre
Biocomputational scientist
My research interests lie in the intersection of bioinformatics, and applied software engineering. My approach to research involves an interplay between experimental and theoretical modeling techniques, and is focused towards identifying and elucidating new knowledge interesting for biologists.

Who we are
Go to the Team Section in the Image Gallery for details on how we spent our summer preparing for the Jamboree.
iGEM Team:
We are a team of seven undergraduates, from every corner of Biology, Physics and Engineering.
Mike Davies : 1st year Engineer.  Our resident Wiki genius (don't worry, he didn't write that), also...""IGEM BOY!!!!""
Shuna Gould : 3rd year Biochemist. Self-styled ""lab rat,"" she is paranoid about sterilization and actually understands what's going on (or does a good job faking).
Siming Ma: 2nd year Biochemist. Usually found reading a scientific paper, his approach to everything is either ""they're bacteria, we have NO IDEA what they might do,"" or, ""it'll be fiiiiiiineee.""
Vivian Mullin: 2nd year Biochemist. Does stupid dances when bacteria change colour, produces awesome roadmaps--at the cost of every piece of paper in the lab and several sharpies.
Megan Stanley:  2nd year Physicist. ""BUT I'M A PHYSICIST!"" and ""GUYS, WE NEED A PLAN!"" A fan of decision-making, which is very useful when the rest of us are faffing.
Alan Walbridge: 2nd year Engineer. Champion of wacky ideas (galvanotaxis and bistable switch anyone?), and he also doesn't have swine flu.
Crispian Wilson: 2nd year Geneticist. Mostly likely to bring us delicious desserts he made himself, also most likely to ask a question NOBODY can answer.
Advisors:
All of our iGEM advisors have been so helpful to us, teaching us in the lab, keeping us well sponsored and well supplied, and giving us feedback every step of the way as we've designed our project.
Jim Ajioka :  Can always be depended on to help us push our plans for the project to their limits and explore every option.
Jim Haseloff : Helps keep us focused on the big picture of the project and its design aspects, so we don't get too caught up in the nitty gritty details.
Gos Micklem : Usually along with James, gleefully runs away with our ideas into a whole new dimension we hadn't even considered--which of course, we then consider.
James Brown : Kindly and patiently puts up with us asking him about 100 questions a day, for which we are INCREDIBLY grateful.
Tom Ellis : Always up for discussions about ideas and often accosted by team members for advice about project designs .
Duncan Rowe :  The Father Christmas of microbiology--as in, his presents are along the lines of plasmid stocks and nifty equipment--he knew what plasmids we wanted for this project last Christmas.  THAT is how organized he is.
Our Friends:
Some people joined us for a 2 week introduction to Synthetic Biology before starting the iGEM course, and continued to stop by and see how we were doing from time to time.
Caitlin Cockerton : Caitlin is from the London School of Economics, and interested in the ethical implications of Synthetic Biology. She is also following the Imperial 2009 iGEM team , who she likes, but not as much as us.
Daisy Ginsberg : From the Royal College of Art, Daisy and James visited us during the summer to discuss how our cheap, easy-to-use contaminant detector could alter lives.
James King : James' work on synthetic meat was recently featured in Wired magazine.
Tuur Van Balen : Also from the Royal College of Art, Tuur taught us the basics of Arduino , and demonstrated some very useful presentation techniques.
Michael Barton : Royal College of Art. Daisy, James Tuur and Michael all create art and provoke thought into the future uses and possibilities of synthetic biology.
Falco Von Birdby , Team Mascot. The 14mm Falcon.
The Team, Advisors and Some Friends - July 2009
From Left to Right:  Tom Cane, Falco Von Birdby, Vivian Mullen, James Brown, Siming Ma, Crispian Wilson, Alan Walbridge, Tom Ellis, Katy Hope (with Duncan Rowe above), Megan Stanley, Shuna Gould (With Jim Ajioka above), Jim Hasseloff, Mike Davies, Gos Micklem, Emma Cull, Natasha Williams, Raluca Cenusa, Daisy Ginsberg.
Katy Hope, Emma Cull, Natasha Williams, Raluca Cenusa and Tom Cane are all studying at the University of Cambridge and joined us for the 2 week introductory course in Synthetic Biology before we started the iGEM project.

Helping other Teams
We helped the Brown University team by supplying them with BBa_K156010 as the version supplied by the registry did not seem functional.
The VCU team visited us here in Charlottesville, Va. on Oct 18, 2009 for a joint practice presentation session. Both teams received invaluable feedback on their projects and improved inter-university relations!

Round table ethics
We, the TU Delft 2009 team, pay some attention to ethics. One of our team members concentrates on this particular subject. In our opinion it is useful to have some ethical discussion within the team during discussion session. Therefore we discuss some ethical issues related to our work. Almost every week we discuss ‘the ethical question of the week’. In our opinion it is good when scientist are aware of the impact which their work might have on the society, therefore it is good to think about the ethical issues of our project as becoming scientists. The aim of the ethical question of the week is to have a discussion within the group in order to see how the individuals in our team think about certain subjects.
What is life? What is synthetic biology?
Week 31
What is life? What is synthetic biology?
What is life? There are two different theories about what life is in our group.  First: a system which is able to take up energy from its environment and creates order form chaos represents life. Second: a system which is able to reproduce, has a metabolism, evolutes and has an organization (order) and is able to survive in a specific environment represent live. This is amore biological point of view toward life.  During this discussion the interesting question arose: is a BioBrick life? The answers was, no a BioBrick does not represent life; it is part of an organism which is a live. So a Biobrick is part of life but it does not represent life by itself.
What is synthetic biology? Synthetic Biology is minimizing real biology. It is also intelligent evolution by rational engineering. Engineering is a very important aspect in Synthetic Biology, its applying engineering concepts in Biological concepts. We all do agree about this definition of synthetic Biology.
Biosafety
Week 32
How important is Biosafety to you? Do you think about biosafety during labwork and do you consider it as part of your job?
We agreed that we are not thinking constantly about this durning lab work. By doing a lot of lab practice during last years we are able to follow the rules properbly and work in the lab safely. Follwoing up teh rules is a habit now.
How important is Biosafety to you and which grad would you give it. Grading between 0 and 10?
0 means not important at all, 10 means vey very important. The ranking was: 3, 10, 8, 8, 10, 8, 9. Average grade is: 8, this means that we as team in genera; do care about biosafety and find it important.
Biosafety in the lab
Week 33
Who should be  respponsible for safety and security in the lab?
Who should be responssible for security? In the organisation there is a hirarchie which explains who is responsibble for safety in the organization. In case there is a big accident in the lab these persons are responsible.
Who should be responssible fo the safety? We, our selfs, are responsible for the safety in the lab. We should be watching what we are doing in the lab.
Who should be liable in case of emergency? In case an accident happens while the lab workersare follow up the rules, as they should do. the person who granded the permition should be liable.
Communication
week 36
Is it important/usefull to inform the public about our work?
Yes, it is important to inform teh public about our work, as scientists.
Why is this usefull/important?
The information flow is at the moment as this: Scientist---->Journalist---->Public. Maybe it will be better when scientists also play a direct role in informing the public. Issues could easly be misunderstandend and represented differently by media, because of the lake of knowledge. Scientific work also needs funding and in general this scientific work is funded by public money, so it is important to inform them about the goals for which this public money is used.
What should our communicationgoal be as scientists?(to inform, to ask more attention, increase the public conception)?
Our goal should be informing teh public. It is not correct to hide information, we should clearly inform the public about the facts. We will not be able to explain all details, but we for sure are able to explain the main lines. Its is also important to clearly inform about the possiblilities and more important about the unpossiblities, to avoid any panic. There should also be attention for the possible side effects. The scientists should explain the occuring chance of side effects by using statistics.
Open source
week 41
Is the registry realy open source? Everybody can see the data, but is everybody also able to get BioBricks from teh registry? Are companies for instance allowed to apply the registry for BioBricks? Joomla(CSM software) for instance is open source software and everyone can use it? Should it be the same with Biobricks?
Is the registry realy open source? This is a bit unclear to us, we don't know if it is possible for companies to apply the registry for BioBricks. It is also not clear to us if research groups from an university which is not joining the iGEM competition are able to apply fot BioBricks. We will contact the iGEM HQ about this issue. Althought in our opinion it shouldn't be a problem to use Biobricks for commercial purperses, but from this a lot of other question will arise like: Who should get the financial benefits? Who has the intellectuel property right? What if a company or researcher alters a BioBrick and want to patent it? Should BioBricks be patented? This are very interessting question which should be answerd in the next years by the scientific community. In case the HQ profides us answers to the above mentioned questions we will share it with you.

Liam Barry
Subject: Mathematics and Physics
Spent the summer contemplating various cutting edge questions like...
""Who decided proteins are spirals?""
""How do you split an atom?""
""What is a nM?""
""Why is the 'i' in iGEM lower case?""
Also indulged in some programming and created numerous segmentation errors in ways previously thought impossible...
Stuart Campbell
Subject: Mathematics and Physics
Hi, just finished my 3rd year in Maths and Physics. Spent most of the summer laughing at Liam's stupid questions and working on the wiki.
:D|-<
Calum de Burgh
Subject: Genetics (Immunology)
Although now deprived of a thinking beard, all is not lost as third year is done and 2009/10 brings an industrial placement in Melbourne, Australia.  Originally started a Marine Biology degree, but changed when I realised I didn't want to smell like fish.  If you have any questions/complaints about our ethics piece, I shall be at Boston, trying to grow the beard that made all ancient philosopher's arguments seem unassailable at the time.
Md. Risat ul Haque
Subject: Microbiology
I am going to begin my final year of undergraduate studies this session. Before that I have been lucky enough to spend my whole summer playing with the overwhelming and tantalizing world of 'Synthetic Biology' with an aim to construct our very efficient and dynamic 'Pico Plumber'!!!
Interested in :Cancer,Genetics, Synthetic Biology and Astronomy.
E-Mail: mdrisat.ul.haque.06@aberdeen.ac.uk
Zuzana Hruskova
Subject: Molecular Biology
After deciding that I didn’t want to finish my studies of Veterinary Medicine in Slovakia I decided to come to Aberdeen. I successfully finished 3rd year and spent crazy summer with other iGEM members thinking about cloning strategies. However after iGEM I am looking forward to starting an industrial placement. Who knows what will be my next crazy decision in the future?!!
Jennifer Kleine-Albers
Subject: Biomedical Science(Pharmacology)
I have just finished my 3rd year in Biomedical Sciences (Pharmacology). This degree is not closely related to synthetic biology, but what made me taking part in iGEM is the interdisciplinary work, which I believe to be very important in future research.
E-Mail: jennifer.kleine-albers.06@aberdeen.ac.uk
Daniel Leirer
Subject: Genetics (Immunology)
Having finished the 3rd year of my undergraduate degree I am spending the summer admiring Pico Plumbers many colourful charms, before starting an industrial placement with the Medical Research Council in London. Interested in Synthetic and Medical biology.
E-Mail: D.J.Leirer.06@Aberdeen.ac.uk
Rory MacDonald
Subject: Chemical Engineering
This mad geeky juggling nerdy raver is going into his fourth year of an undergraduate masters degree in chemical engineering. With his passion-fruit for science and battle-quest for knowledge, he types out endless MATLAB scripts for the team whilst running on cereal and protein shake.
Katriona McMichael
Subject: Immunology
I began my university career at Aberdeen studying Psychology. After deciding that it was not the subject for me, I transferred to the wonderful school of medical sciences to do a degree in Immunology. I have just finished my third year, and am now about to run away to the lovely country of Switzerland for a year’s industrial placement at Novartis.
James Reid
Subject: Mathematics and Physics
James is compulsively interested in Everything and oftimes inescapably chatty.  Watch out for me wearing a kilt at the Jamboree! :-P
Nicholas Smart
Subject: Physics
Just graduated this year in physics, starting work in August as a graduate optical engineer but spending summer lost somewhere in pico plumber's 29 dimensional parameter space
Annika Wipprecht
Subject: Mathematics and Physics
I've just finished my 3rd year of my undergraduate degree in Maths and Physics. For my summer break I decided to take part in iGEM. Spending most of my time in front of a computer, it was good fun working on the dynamical behaviour of our Pico Plumber.

Personal note
During our iGEM project and especially during brainstorming period I faced a new type of feelings and dilemmas. That was the first time in my life when I had the real power to do something what might change some routine events flow in everyday life of some people. At the same time I could use this time and power to solve some other problems which are not less important than any other problems but are more academical and might turn useful only after decades or just disappear in the river of scientific discoveries. I could spend this 10 weeks just to create something funny what might make people who saw our achievment smile every time they think about it. There is nothing harder then to make people smile about something kind, without any evil underlying idea which might be funny for somebody and not too funny for somebody else.
Personally, I wanted to do everything. Why not to cure the cancer? Why not to prove that robots are just the step of evolution of mind and soul? Why not to create the bacteria which helps you to wash dishes? As the member of the team I clearly understood that we need to adjust our personal desires and interests. I don't know how my teammates solved their personal dilemmas, but I did it quite easily. I have a theory that a greatest gift human being got from Nature is its ability to transform the energy. Energy by itself is neutral and only human being can transform it into positive energy which inspires everybody around, or into negative energy which demoralizes everybody including the person who created it. I knew exactly that if there will be a choice between projects I would prefer the one which might help people to solve their everyday problems, because life is too short and amount of positive energy I created so far is not impressive. iGEM is the first opportunity in 20 years of my life to do something really huge and positive, so I have to use it.

   My first degree is in Bioprocess Engineering, and my Ph.D. is in Microbial Biotechnology (specifically,    biotransformations of natural products for the chemical industry). I now lecture in general and applied    microbiology    and biotechnology in the School of Biological Sciences, University of Edinburgh. My research is    mainly concerned with the development of microbial systems for industrial and environmental applications. I    have been supervising Edinburgh's IGEM entries since 2006. I think BioBricks are a great tool for the    development of new biological systems; my Ph.D. students are applying them to the development of biosensors    and systems for conversion of lignocellulosic biomass to useful products.

Personal note
During our iGEM project and especially during brainstorming period I faced a new type of feelings and dilemmas. That was the first time in my life when I had the real power to do something what might change some routine events flow in everyday life of some people. At the same time I could use this time and power to solve some other problems which are not less important than any other problems but are more academical and might turn useful only after decades or just disappear in the river of scientific discoveries. I could spend this 10 weeks just to create something funny what might make people who saw our achievment smile every time they think about it. There is nothing harder then to make people smile about something kind, without any evil underlying idea which might be funny for somebody and not too funny for somebody else.
Personally, I wanted to do everything. Why not to cure the cancer? Why not to prove that robots are just the step of evolution of mind and soul? Why not to create the bacteria which helps you to wash dishes? As the member of the team I clearly understood that we need to adjust our personal desires and interests. I don't know how my teammates solved their personal dilemmas, but I did it quite easily. I have a theory that a greatest gift human being got from Nature is its ability to transform the energy. Energy by itself is neutral and only human being can transform it into positive energy which inspires everybody around, or into negative energy which demoralizes everybody including the person who created it. I knew exactly that if there will be a choice between projects I would prefer the one which might help people to solve their everyday problems, because life is too short and amount of positive energy I created so far is not impressive. iGEM is the first opportunity in 20 years of my life to do something really huge and positive, so I have to use it.

   Name: Kim de Mora
   Hi! I'm currently a PhD candidate at the University of Edinburgh.  My research interests include engineering    peroxisomes in S. cerevisiae and investigating standardization questions in synthetic biology.  I was a member of    the 2006 Edinburgh iGEM team when we designed and built the arsenic biosensor.  I've since been an advisor for    the 2007, 2008 and 2009 teams.

   Hi,I'm Damian. I am a PhD student working on a synthetic biology approach to cellulose degradation. Being    involved with iGEM for the first time as an advisor was great fun. Over the past few weeks I've been helping out the    team around the lab and offering what good (or bad) advice I could. The team worked extremely well in the lab    and very quickly got the hang of BioBricking. Best of luck at the prize giving guys. Enjoy the rest of the tour around    the wiki!!

Here are some of our pictures taken during our time spent on the iGEM project, and everybody will have no doubts that we had FUN! Moreover, our fan level is definitely higher than any other expected by an average iGEM judge :)
Unfortunately, our gallery flash object might not (but should) work with Firefox 3, but works perfectly with IE8 and Firefox 2. So, there's a fancy gallery for IE8/FF2 users and all the unlucky people who can't see the photos are welcome to visit our Facebook group to view them.
It takes some time for the photos to upload, but please be patient!

Here we are! The Edinburgh University 2009 iGEM Team. This our our introduction video to the team. Firstly, we wanted this to open our wiki, but we decided that, after you have read our wiki, this video will give you better understanding of what our team wanted to achieve. Don't forget to switch your sound on. Enjoy!
   Name: Vasilis Andreou
   Hey guys my name is Vasilis Andreou. Something you don't know about me is that my house in Nicosia, Cyprus    is about 2 minutes from the borders dividing the town, and in the  opposite direction is about 2 minutes from the    country's prison. See you in MIT!!
   Contact email: V.Andreou

   Name: Evangeline JiaLing Oh
   I was born and bred in Singapore. Apart from ice-cream, I love gene regulatory networks. Sometime in the near    future, I hope to be BioBricking in eukaryotic cells. Have fun and break a leg in MIT.
   Contact email: E.J.Oh-2

   Name: Dasha  Ausiannikava
   Hi I am Dasha and I love biology. iGEM has been the most exhilarating and challenging project I have ever done,    and it made me realize how many possibilities are presented to me by what I study!
   Contact email: D.Ausiannikava
sms.ed.ac.uk
   Name: Julia Skripka-Serry
   My name is Julia and I was born in Kiev, Ukraine. I moved to Belgium at a young age and since then I have had    the pleasure of being a citizen of the world, having lived in Ireland, UK and the Middle East—and the list keeps    growing! I have degrees in Biotechnology and Drug Discovery, and particularly love everything gene-related.
   To me, IGEM conveys an emotion.  A mixture of excitement, uncertainty and, most intriguingly, empowerment. If    you, as a biologist, ever doubt the practical potential of your knowledge, I challenge you to take part in this    competition—you will instantly understand what kind of powerful sci-fi stuff lurks within your brain!

   Name: Winston Ho
   Hello there! Names Winston, born in the 'deen, which is up in the North-East of Scotland. I'm studying chemical    engineering, having just started my 4th year at Edinburgh. Can't wait to join the oil industry ;) I also have a soft    spot for biology =) CU at MIT!
   Contact email: W.Ho-3

   Name: Rachel ""Lady GaGa"" Morrison
   Hello, my name is Rachel though over the course of the summer my lovely team mates have called me a variety    of things including Lady Gaga. I am currently in my final year of a master’s of Chemical Engineering though I have    spent most of the summer learning how to model gene expression networks, program in JAVA and MATLAB and    have also picked up some biology along the way!
   Contact email: R.A.Morrison-2

   Name: JD
   Good day! My name is Jan, but I always sign as JD. I am guy doing my Artificial Intelligence degree which gives    me access and time to think about philosophical aspects of life. Is the progress movement from Chaos to    Harmony or other way around? How infinite is relativity of definitions? What is the difference between dictatorship    of Absolute Good and Absolute Evil? I am made out of those questions.
   Those are the very last words added to our WIKI. WIKI marathon comes to an end for me, for the whole team, for    the whole iGEM community. Those are the most sweet moments in every project when your job is done and you    can spend one day enjoying yourself because after tomorrow will be another day and another competition and a    new fight. Good luck!

   Name: Rohin
   Hello 'n Namaste! My name's Rohin and I hail from the city of Jaipur in the 'Land-of-kings' Rajasthan in India. I    used to be a biologist, before I became a bioinformatician, and then changed into an Informatician, finally turning    into an angry mutant with adamantium claws. If I weren't me, I would have an Identity crisis. Even though I'm glad I    am doing what I'm doing, I would like to be an RJ, a Scuba diver, a Roadside guitar player, an Investment banker,    and the president of the UN general assembly at least once in my life. For now, I'll check out MIT and see how    that goes ;-) All the best for iGEM !

   Name: Sam Kammerling
   I'm Sam, and I have been singing theme tunes for scientists for as long as I can  remember. Growing up in the    English countryside it was every child's dream to have your  voice heard on the international scientific stage, and    now this dream has    come true  thanks to the Edinburgh iGem team. Singing about bacteria is my passion, and I    hope I  inspire others to be as passionate about bacteria as me. Big love peeps x

   Name: Kacper Rogala
   I study Biochemistry, love film and good food! I was engaged to film, act in and produce the team's awesome    promotional video. This picture of me was taken during the ""explosion scene"". I am also a hairy chewbacca.

We are a relatively international team, so we thought it would be interesting for you to know bit more about the places we came from. Our team consists of 8 undergraduates from 7 different countries.

Output control: The lambda cI-repressed promoter, controlling the expression of RFP.
Input control 1: The ara promoter, controlling the transcription of cI. Instead of a standard ribosome-binding site, there will be a ""ribolock"", which causes a portion of the mRNA transcript upstream of the RBS to form secondary structure which prevents binding of ribosomes. This will strongly hinder translation until the structure is forced to unfold.
Input control 2: The lac promoter, controlling the expression of a ""ribokey"", a non-coding sequence complementary to the upstream sequence of the ribolock. 
 
With this setup, it should be possible to have input values of 0/false for <sugar> absent and 1/true for <sugar> present, and output values of 0/false for RFP absent and 1/true for RFP present. It is true that it is a less elegant solution than that of the 2007 UTSC team , but it may be extensible to any input provided there exists some method of detecting it; signal inverters do exist.
 
A second use of this project is to test the efficacy of the ribolocks when under the control of a promoter other than tetracycline, and to see what changes to efficiency can be made in ribolocks using available BioBricks. A third use (if Natasha's project doesn't use this idea) is to test the temperature-sensitivity of the ribolocks by culturing key-less ribolocked RFP at different temperatures and observing at what temperature the locks fail to function.
 
potential sticking points
Because the lac-controlled ribokey must be present for the ara-controlled cI to be translated, and the ribokey should degrade quickly compared to the mRNA if not being constantly replenished, any leaky transcription from the lac promoter should have reduced consequences on the level of RFP.
If too much leaky transcription is occuring anyway, then different ribosome binding sites with reduced efficiency could be used. That choice should help to reduce the occurance of leaky transcription.
The only available lambda cI coding sequence has a signal tag for rapid degradation; it may not stick around long enough for significant repression of RFP. If this is the case, then the promoter and cI from phage 434 could be substituted in, with nothing more than some extra assembly work.
 
potentially needed BioBricks:
BBa_I0500 (arabinose-induced promoter, includes araC gene to ensure repression)
BBa_R0010 (lactose- or IPTG-induced promoter)
BBa_E1010 (RFP)
BBa_B0034 (the BioBrick standard RBS)
BBa_B0030 or BBa_B0032 (RBSs with 0.6 and 0.3 the activity of the standard RBS)
BBa_B0014 (the BioBrick standard transcription double termination signal)
BBa_J23066 (the optimal ribokey from Berkeley's 2006 iGEM submission )
BBa_J23032 (one of the better ribolocks from same)
BBa_C0051 (lambda cI coding sequence, with a rapid degradation tag appended)
BBa_R0051 (lambda cI-repressed promoter)
BBa_C0056 (phage 434 cI, no degradation tag)
BBa_R0052 (434 cI-repressed promoter)
BBa_K128005 (18bp sequence which could be prepended to the ribolock, in an attempt to emulate Berkeley's best lock)

Our City
Newcastle upon Tyne
We are the team from Newcastle University, which is one of two universities in the North East city of Newcastle upon Tyne in the United Kingdom.
The city is famed for its rich history, and its numerous bridges that span the River Tyne, crossing to the town of Gateshead. The city is full of diverse culture, with this partly being shown by short-listed bids to gain the European Capital of Culture title. One of the cities leading museums, the Great North Museum: Hancock, is supported by the university.
Newcastle had large coal mining and manufacturing industries through the 19th and 20th centuries, and has since gained a reputation as a shopping haven and a party-city. It is also the home of a world famous soccer club, Newcastle United , and the beer Newcastle Brown Ale .
Newcastle has recently been famous for being the home, Northern Rock, of the first bank that fell during the 2007 financial crisis.
Past students
Newcastle has had a large number of famous people as past students of the Universities including actor Rowan Atkinson, and singer Bryan Ferry. Newcastle's neighbour Northumbria University was home to Jonathan Ive, the designer of Apple computers recent products including the iPod, iMac and iPhone. Even this year at Newcastle University a member of the royal family is among our freshers students; Princess Eugenie of York, sixth in line to the British throne.
If you want to have a fun time at University, come to study in Newcastle. Whether you want to have a cultured experience in our galleries and museums, party in our amazing selection of bars and clubs, eat stunning food, meet friendly people, or just have the time of your life Newcastle is the place to be!
By Air, Sea, Rail or Road
By Rail Newcastle is accessible via the Newcastle Railway Station, which lies on the main East coast line of Britian. The station was opened in 1850, designed by John Dobson, a famed designer in the North East, and built in collaboration with Northern engineer Robert Stephenson. Robert Stephenson's father, George Stephenson was a pioneer of steam powered railways. The station is located in the city centre near the River Tyne.
By Road Newcastle lies on the A1 road which follows the route of one of the historic roads of Britian, the Great North Road. The Great North Road was used for some of the first national mail delivery coaches from London to Edinburgh. Some of the University's main buildings including King's Gate are on the roads around the Great North Road.
By Air Newcastle can by reached by catching one of the many flights to Newcastle International Airport. The airport was opened in 1935 and is located just outside the city in Woolsington. The two most popular flights from Newcastle are to London Heathrow and Amsterdam in the Netherlands.
By Sea the city of Newcastle lies on the River Tyne. Ferries run to various destinations in Europe from North Shields - the mouth of the Tyne on the east coast. Why not come and see our vast array of Bridges.

Ethics & Safety
Ethics Safety
A team is defined by two criteria: its members and the way it articulates itself. Come discover the characteristics of our team…
Team Strategy
Several elements are crucial for the development of an innovative project:
- the concept,
- the theoretical development that enables the building of a prototype,
- the experimental development that enables the validation of the prototype,
- the providing of technical and material needs,
- the foreseeing of ethical and social problems brought by the project,
In this aim, we have structured our team as follows:
A management team, with experience in the development of innovative projects and a full vision on how to deal with them.
A R&D team to validate the theoretical and experimental concept.
A communication team to meet the internal and external needs of the project.
Haut de page
Team
Here is the story of our team throughout iGEM 2009:
Top row, from left to right : Nassrine Lablack, David Charoy, Aurélie Négrel, Thierry Leclerc and Timothée Kirkhus.
Bottom row, from left to right : Ranya Jamali, Enguerrand Habran, Damien Parrello, Gaella Azzi, Cyprien Verseux  and Emma Valette.
Enguerrand HABRAN, specialized in R&D in biotechnologies, managed a team of 11 students during this adventure and brought the DVS project to a successful conclusion. Throughout his professional experience, he has acquired multiple competences in the realm of entrepreneurial and management skills, in particular by being project leader several times.
Passionate about science, he has conceived all through his curriculum an innovative concept based on a vectorization principle. Convinced of its feasibility, he has chosen to pursue his research in order to create a prototype. To reach his goal, he has studied feverishly publications and has turned towards the grand names of the field. Once he had the sufficient theoretical knowledge, he developed his experimental competences in the laboratory of Professor COUVREUR, working on an anti-cancer nano-particle.
Combining theory and experimentation, he brought to light the underlying problems of vectorisation and elaborated with the rest of the team a double vectorisation system (DVS) to provide an answer.
After that, he selected, for the iGEM adventure, the students of the team according to their competences related to the project.
Enguerrand decided to take the lead of the R&D team and entrusted the communication team to Gaëlla AZZI.
Due to their common and complementary experiences in the creation and development of projects, Enguerrand was convinced of the asset of having Gaëlla in the iGEM project. Being a 5th year student specialized in Commercial Marketing in biotechnologies, she has obtained her competences throughout various professional experiences.
All along the iGEM adventure, she has managed a team of 3 students with whom she prospected the market for sponsors . She has been brought to negotiate and oversee the orders of laboratory material suppliers so as to satisfy the internal needs of the R&D team.
She then turned her attention to the external problems of the project, particularly the ethics and social questions that were brought up by our concept. She thus supervised the creation of an ethics conference focused on synthetic biology.

Eve Ranya JAMALI and Emma VALETTE, 4th year students, as well as Yolène MONEDERO, a 5th year student specialised in Commercial Marketing in biotechnologies, have accomplished several different missions during the adventure. They prospected for sponsors and worked on the elaboration of different communication medias.
It is especially their double competence in the scientific and communication fields that have rendered them interesting for this adventure.
A good visualisation of the concept and understanding of the ethical and societal questions brought up by it, aided by the numerous experiences in this field, have enabled Ranya to organize, and lead as best as possible the ethical conference and Emma to answer questions based on Safety .
The concept had already been defined when the iGEM adventure started out. We knew the characteristics of our vector and target cell, yet many questions remained unanswered.
Damien PARELLO, a 5th year student specialized in R&D in biotechnologies, was assigned the task of studying our target cell and its mutations. He studied its membrane proteins in order to determine THE protein that would be specific of our target cell.
Thus, he established that the protein c-kit is solely found on the membrane of our target cell. He then identified the target protein of this receptor and designed its BioBrick . One of the proteins of our phage is now adorned with this BioBrick, enabling him to target our interest cells.
He then determined the most common mutations in the cancerous cells so as to decide which genes to add to our therapeutic plasmid .
He thus studied then chose the genes containing the mutations before conducting thorough studies on them in a laboratory.
Once the target molecule and its mutations were defined, we had to build our cell vector .
To begin, David CHARROY, a 5th year student specialized in R&D in biotechnologies, and Cyprien VERSEUX, 1st year student in biotechnologies, prepared a résumé of the current situation of phages so as to understand its operating system.
They then decided to “BioBrick” it entirely so as to render it adjustable.
Knowing the phage thoroughly, they chose the optimal location for the target protein identified by Damien. Yet, a problem remained: can the naturally non-infectious cell vector for eukaryote cells manage to enter the target cell?
David then had the idea of adding a second target protein on our vector: a protein from an adenovirus to help escape the endosome. He then turned it into a “BioBrick” and added it to our vector .
For our studies in a laboratory , the phage was studied by David, Nassrine LABLACK and Aurélie NEGREL, both 5th year students specialized in R&D in biotechnologies. All three of them have hands on experience in various laboratories. David and Aurélie both followed a technical training before joining Sup’Biotech. Nassrine, in addition to her curriculum at Sup’Biotech, works in a biology laboratory.
A protein to be modified, a cellular vector; we just had to find our tissue vector .
Thierry LECLERC, a 4th year student specialized in R&D in biotechnologies, prepared a résumé on the current situation of Mycobacterium, our candidate for the tissue vector . He had two principle objectives: the capacity of resisting the immune system and the lung tropism. Once he had gathered sufficient information about the bacteria, he validated the theoretical concept, proving that Mycobacterium would perfectly fill in its role, by using scientific literature.
In the aim of a technical validation, he elaborated a follow-up study of Mycobacterium in a murin organism. To do this, he created close ties with Mycobacterium specialists, and has made analogies with various in vivo studies that have been conducted. After that, he applied the previous study in a laboratory.
Finally, for the modelisation part , Timothée KIRKHUS, a 4th year student specialised in Production in biotechnologies, modelised the effects of our treatment of a lung tumor, so as to determine the injection kinetics of different DVS system.
The complementarity of each student has enabled the team to fulfil all the obligations of the project. Thanks to research, analysis and interpretation, all have contributed their knowledge and understanding to solve as accurately as possible all underlying questions to attain our objective: fulfilling the DVS project.

Who we are
The University of Lethbridge iGEM team is composed of seven undergraduate students, two graduate students and our supervisor.  We also have a crew of advisory members, mostly past team members who have moved on.  We mainly have backgrounds in biochemistry, but neuroscience and biology majors are also included.  Because of our small size, we have split the workload in the sense that certain people are in charge of various efforts, but everyone helps out and experiences everything.
Individual Bios
Hj Wieden is our team instructor. Assistant Professor University of Lethbridge(2005 - present);Ph.D. University of Witten/Herdecke(2000);M.Sc. Heinrich-Heine University, Düsseldorf(1994);Ingenuity New Faculty(2007);Canada Research Chair (TIER2) in Physical Biochemistry (2005).
Jeffrey Fischer is a PhD candidate working with HJ Wieden on characterizing the kinetics of a novel ribosome associated GTPase. He is involved with some modeling, lab work, and anything else that needs some doing. Spare time (what spare time?) activities include playing soccer, going to the gym, hiking, and travelling when possible
Alix Blackshaw is going into her fourth year of Neuroscience.  This is her second year of iGEM and she will be working primarily on fundraising, ethics and gaining lab skills.
Lisza Bruder is a 4th year biochemistry major.  She is working with the research and development team for iGEM this summer.
Mackenzie Coatham is entering her second year of biochemistry studies at the University of Lethbridge.   This is her first year participating in the iGEM competition and she hopes to gain practical experience that she could apply to a future career in medicine. In her spare time, she enjoys such sports as dance and figure skating.  She also loves to read, watch television, travel and spend time with friends.
Ashley Duncan is going into her fourth year of biochemistry.  This is her first year in iGEM and she has taken on editing the wiki as well as working on the Team's ""Business Plan"" through Alberta Ingenuity Fund.  She spends her summers working at Agriculture and Agri-Foods Canada as a research assistant in the Winter Wheat Genetics program.  In her spare time she enjoys camping and taking her dog for coulee runs.
Fan Mo is a M.Sc student in biochemistry. She is also a member of the R&D group.  This summer she will play with some molecular biology assays, and hopefully they are fun.
Kirsten Rosler is going into her fourth year of biochemistry and can be seen walking around campus with her headphones permantly implanted in her ears.  This is her first year of iGEM and she is looking forward to getting some hands on lab experience.  In her freetime she enjoys snowboarding, swimming and watching all the TV seasons she can.
Roxanne Shank is a 4th year Biochemistry Major with a specialty in NMR Spectroscopy and RNA Biology. Roxanne participated on the UofL iGEM team in 2008, and looks forward to continuing the iGEM experience this year. Roxanne will be leading us in the lab along with Jeffrey Fischer as our official lab masters, offering tutorials and extra help where needed, as well as ensuring that lab supplies and equipment are maintained. Roxanne is currently undertaking an Honours Thesis in RNA Biochemistry with Dr. Ute Kothe, and works in the Chemistry department with Dr. Paul Hazendonk and Dr. Michael Gerken studying Fluorinated Compounds and Polymers via Solid-State and Solution Based NMR.
Megan Torry has a degree in Neuroscience, and is presently doing open studies while working for Dr. McNaughton at the Canadian Center for Behavioural Neuroscience.  Her main focuses are cognitive processes, data analysis, and discovering research areas and topics that increase her ambition to go back to school.  During her spare time you may find her with friends and family, playing in the garden or snow, playing soccer, or experimenting with food, music, crafts, paints or the occasional piece of clay.

Undergraduates
Sahil ""Mr Baller"" Prasada
A remarkable individual of considerable talent, ability, and girth, the esteemed Mr. Prasada is the latest addition to Duke's elite iGEM team. His innumerable achievments span many varied fields, earning numerous recognitions at innovation summits (for his humor), at tennis tourneys (for his egregious sportsmanship), and at local dances (for his exaggerated gyrations of the hip) among others. His research interests are likewise broad, and as one of the best and brightest young minds of our time, he is very excited to share his latest findings with you at iGEM this November.
Sahil aspires to be a cardiologist, just like his father, when he grows up. His favorite hobbies include tennis, kangaroo-watching, eating, and bhangra dancing. Sahil's academic interests include yeast mating, doxorubicin, and hydrogen fuels.

A bunch of energetic young guys bumping into each other in pursuit of the truth of life, and this is basically the essential reason why we are here now.
This year, we are much more populated than before. This not only gets solid proof from the increasing coverage of participants' number, but also can be demonstrsted by the big variance among participants' backgrounds. The 2009 iGEM team of USTC, well, if we just count the dry team, consists of two graduate students and four undergraduates. Our major varies from  electrnic engineering to condensed matter physics, from geophysics to computational biology. By such a colorful combination, anything exciting could be possible relying on our brotherhood. We feel so lucky to get acquaintance with each other and really enjoy all the funny days we are together. We will enjoy the days in MIT, just join us!

Our major varies from  electrnic engineering to condensed matter physics, from geophysics to computational biology. By such a colorful combination, anything exciting could be possible relying on our brotherhood. We feel so lucky to get acquaintance with each other and really enjoy all the funny days we are together. We will enjoy the days in MIT, just join us!

Research interests:
Molecular mechanisms of virulence of bacteria Listeria monocytogenes, especially the role of a hemolysin, listeriolysin O (LLO).  LLO is a 58 kDa sulphydryl-activated, pore-forming cytotoxin which allows L. monocytogenes to escape from the phagocytic vesicle in macrophage and causes actin cytoskeleton reorganization in infected cells. LLO- mutants are much less virulent and do not survive in macrophages.

Research interests:
Regulation of gene expression in mitochondria is achieved mainly by controlling stability of mRNA and its decay rate. Nuclear encoded proteins participate in polyadenylation of mitochondrial transcripts and in their subsequent degradation. At present I work on four human genes involved in these processes : polyA polymerase, polynucleotide phosphorylase, RNA helicase and RNase II.  Three of them have been characterized for the first time in my lab.
Two of the proteins seem to play additional important roles in aging and cancer. To study this, my research plans involve employing various techniques of molecular biology, proteomics and transgenic animal models.
Personal:
married, two children
hobbys: opera, antique textiles
Michał Lower
I come from Warsaw, our capital city :-). I study Biotechnology at University of Warsaw. My M. Sc. thesis in Department of Virology was about new method of rapid determination of type III DNA methyltransferase recognition sequences. Apart from molecular biology I'm passionated with computer programming.
Paweł Krawczyk
I come from small village in the south of Poland  but now I’m a student of biotechnology and psychology at the College of Interfaculty Individual Studies in Mathematics and Natural Sciences, University of Warsaw. Scientifically I’m freak on any fluorescent methods connected with protein research. My B. Sc. thesis was mainly about FRET method in context of  regulation of the Hsp90 molecular chaperone protein. No I work in the field of neuroscience, especially on the molecular basis of schizophrenia (it doesn’t mean I live in a world of hallucinations). In my free time I love to play football and volleyball and listen to music, especially blues and rock.  Last year I've started in iGEM as a student and it was very challenging experience. I hope it will help during this year ""synthetic"" adventure

THE WARSAW TEAM
Our team consist of 14 students (mainly undergrads in biotechnology) and 4 supervisors . We are highly motivated group, ready to challenge the world (at first iGEM Competition :))
Due to logistic reasons, we're divided into two working groups: Pawinskiego and Miecznikowa (coming from the names of streets where our labs are located). Both groups ar working on different parts of the same project.
Where do we come from? - Students Scientific Societies
There's also one more thing we have to confess... most of us are tenacious activists of students' scientific associations at our Faculty
Students' Society of Genetics and Epigenetics
Students' Society of Genetics and Epigenetics was founded in 2003. It has developed a noble tradition of weekly seminars (spoken by first-year students as well as by guests from abroad), conferences in the Faculty's field station in the lake region of Mazury, and, above all, scientific projects planned and realized by students with just as much help as necessary from their older colleagues. We have accomplished Pfu polymerase production and purification, we studied to what extent ethidium bromide is able to diffuse through laboratory gloves and we're still working on development of efficient oligo-DNA microarray stripping method.
Students' Society of Microbiology
Students' Society of Microbiology also hosts weekly seminars and organizes visits in biotechnological and microbiological laboratories. Last year we studied active center of Vsr endonuclease by substituting particular aminoacids with alanine and evaluating how the substitution influences enzyme's activity.
Students' Society of Synthetic Biology ""Genesis""
Students' Society of Synthetic Biology ""Genesis"" is a relatively new but dynamically developing organisation. The members of the society are interested in synthetic biology and nanotechnology. We strongly believed that future development of these disciplines will benefit new ravishing discoveries and technologies. Our members hold  weekly lectures and strive to involve as many students as possible in practical activities, such as the iGEM competition.
Students' Society of Molecular Biology
And last, but certainly not least, is the Students' Society of Molecular Biology . We are the oldest student's society at the Faculty of Biology. We hold weekly seminars as well as participate in in numerous conferences and workshops - both in Poland and abroad. Our most recent project involved verification o localization of five putative mitochondrial proteins.
Students' Society of Biological Chemistry ""Nucleotide""
The society has been found in 2008 and we are associated with College of Interfaculty Individual Studies in Mathematics and Natural Sciences. Our society is multidisciplinary however the members are interested mostly in organic chemistry and some aspects of molecular biology connected to mRNA turnover. We not only hold weekly lectures but also involved in practical activities at Division of Biophysics .

Pawinskiego group
We are working at the Institute of Biochemistry and Biophysics PAS building, in the laboratory equiped by the Institute of Genetics and Biotechnology . Our work is focused on the ""effector"" elements of our proposed system - mainly the cytoplasmic operon, but also the endosome detection operon. The supervisor of our group is Pawel Krawczyk , and Kamila Ornoch is coordinating our work.
Team members
Kamila Ornoch
I come from Warsaw and study Biology at University of Warsaw. My B. Sc. thesis in Institute of Genetics and Biotechnology is about intracellular localization of Suv3 protein from Danio rerio. And I love to climb: high is my infatuation :)
Kamil Koper
I come from a small town in south-east Poland, but I spent most of my life living in Warsaw. I study Biotechnology at the Warsaw University in the Institute of Genetics and Biotechnology. My B. Sc. thesis focused on human mitochondrial DNA polymorphisms and their correlation with the occurrence of specific forms of cancer. If I'm not in the lab or out playing billiards with friends you can usually find me in my workshop, or playing vintage video games.
Jakub Piątkowski
I study biotechnology at the University of Warsaw (Institute of Genetics and Biotechnology). My research interests include RNA turnover in mitochondria and the evolution of organellar genomes. My B.Sc. thesis focused on a novel RNA-binding protein DMR1p in S. cerevisiae. Currently I’m working on my M.Sc. thesis, where I plan to include more detailed description of RNA-protein interactions in yeast mitochondrion. I also participate in the activities of the students’ societies: of Molecular and Synthetic Biology.
Marcin Ziemniak
I am a student of chemistry and biotechnology at the College of Interfaculty Individual Studies in Mathematics and Natural Sciences, University of Warsaw. My scientific interests include all aspects of bioorganic and theoretical chemistry connected with biopolymers, and some fields of biology involving synthetic and structural biology. Actually I am working in Division of Biophysics , UW and try to synthesize some new analogues of 5’ mRNA cap structures with superior biological properties. Moreover, I am about to finish my B. Sc thesis which is linked to chromatin remodeling. Besides my scientific work, I like listening to metal music and reading books especially science-fiction novels.
Andrzej Prokop
I was born in Sanok and I'm studying Molecular Biology at the University of Warsaw. I have just defended my bachelor's thesis in the topic of RNA-directed DNA methylation. I am fascinated with the RNA WORLD and my plan is to continue that passion in practical way. I also share some passions with this guy with the millipede avatar, which are spiders, snakes, scorpions and other cute and fluffy animals. Moreover, I like good black metal, ambient, classical music and garlic.
Justyna Lesiak
I am a student of Master Degree in Molecular Biology at the Univeristy of Warsaw, but I spent last semester at Vrije Universiteit of Brussels. Now I am working in the Institute of Genetics and Biotechnology and in the International Institute of Molecular and Cell Biology. I am not focused on one topic, and I always wanted to do lots of new and challenging things in the science area, however I must admit cancer researches are one of my very favourites, as well as human mitochondrial diseases. In my spare time I like to listen to classical and chamber music, read books, do irish dancing (I admire reels and hornpipes) and horseback riding.
Sebastian Jeleń
I come from small town in the south-east Poland. I always wanted to study chemistry but 4 years ago I suddenly decided to study biotechnology. After these 4 years of study I see that it wasn't bad decision. Except doing some research in my lab (hSUV3 rules!) I love taking pictures and playing computer games.
Anna Saffray
I am a high school student and I have lived in Warsaw since 2003. Before that  I lived in France near Paris . I  always loved to do some experiments in my school , so when I started to work in the laboratory it was a great pleasure spending days with pipettes.

We are working at the Faculty of Biology building, in the laboratory equiped by the Department of Virology and Department of Applied Microbiology . Our work is focused on the first element of our proposed system - the invasion operon. The supervisor of our group is Michael Lower and Marek Krzyżanowski is coordinating our work.
Team members
Marek Krzyżanowski
I am a student  at the  University of Warsaw. My B.Sc thesis in Department of Molecular Biology is about colocalization of some nuclear proteins, as a  part of elucidating biological role of ERH protein in human cells. Apart from biology I'm keen on motorsport and everything connected with cars.
Monika Niepokojczycka
I come from Warsaw and I’m a student of Biotechnology at the University of Warsaw. My B. Sc. thesis in Department of Immunology is about the role of Toll-like receptors in development and function of natural regulatory T cells. Apart from studing I'm keen on hiking, treking, photograpy and learnig what you can find to eat on your route;)
Franek Fijałkowski
I come from Warsaw, and as most of our team I study Biotechnology at University of Warsaw.
I used to work in Nencki Institute of Experimental Biology on store-operated calcium channels in electrically non-excitable cells, but since September 2008 I have transfered to Department of Metabolic Regulation where I did my B. Sc. thesis on function of hypothalamic AMP-dependent kinase in the control of food intake.
I try do divide my free time between student associations (Student Association for Molecular Biology, and Student Association for Evolutionary Biology) and my precious animals - mainly tarantulas and scolopendras.
Anna Olchowik
I am a final year biotechnology student at the University of Edinburgh. Apart from biology I love traveling, ice skating and computer science, unfortunately it does not help me in becoming a better biologist. Programming is my standard cure  for insomnia. I like having fun with sun technologies, recently SunSPOTs and JavaFx. I will fill this empty space below or find the smaller photo very soon.
Michał Kamiński
I come from Warsaw and I'm studying Biotechnology at University of Warsaw. My B. Sc. thesis in Department of Applied Microbiology are immunotoxins, especially potential usage of listeriolisyn O as an immunotoxin. In my free time I love to go hiking, treking, whitewater kayaking and sailing.
Jarosław Pankowski
I live near Warsaw and I study Biotechnology at the University of Warsaw. My B. Sc. thesis in Department of Genetic of Bacteria is about plasmids found in marine bacteria. Besides the science I'm interested in fantasy books, metal music and for some time in sword fighting.

The Stress Busters
The Stress Busters were formed in 2009, and consists of the three musketeers. The name the stress busters came under the influence of the film “Ghost busters”. As men on a mission, their role was to seek out the bad ghosts and arrest them. However, the three musketeers at UCL are on a mission to detect any processing related stress levels that the E-coli cells are undergoing. As you can see, our team of 3 is quite small so roles like designing/updating the wikipages,working in the labs and researching are shared between us. The Stress Busters are a tight knit of Biochemical Engineers and Biochemists.

University of Bologna
The University of Bologna is the oldest continually operating degree-granting university in Europe, the word 'university' being first used by this institution at its foundation. The true date of its founding is uncertain, but believed by most accounts to have been 1088. Since 2000, the University's motto has been Alma mater studiorum (Latin for ""fostering mother of studies""). The university of Bologna received a charter from Frederick I Barbarossa in 1158, but in the 19th century, a committee of historians led by Giosuè Carducci traced the birth of the University back to 1088, making it arguably the oldest university in the world. The University of Bologna is historically notable for its teaching of canon and civil law.
The University counts about 100,000 students in its 23 faculties. It has branch centers in Reggio Emilia, Imola, Ravenna, Forlì, Cesena and Rimini and a branch center abroad in Buenos Aires. Moreover, it has a school of excellence named Collegio Superiore di Bologna.
The spread of the first degree course in Cesena dates back to November 1989, but actually the idea of a university in Cesena was conceived a long time ago. As a matter of fact, it was during the 16th century that a public studio was opened for the first time. In 1675 Pope Clement X declared the privileges ""Universitatis Caesenae eiusque Collegiorum et Collegium Juristarum amplioribus facultatibus decoratur"" and in 1796 Pope Pius VI recognized the legitimacy of the degrees granted by Cesena's Studio.
Today the University seat of Cesena is characterized by predominantly scientific academic offerings and coordinates the activities of three locally-based Faculties (Architecture, Engineering II and Psychology) and of other decentralized degree courses from the Faculties of Agriculture, Veterinary Medicine, Mathematical, Physical and Natural Science, all based in Bologna.
The University in Cesena can also boast qualified research structures, which represent a resource for the institutions and the companies operating in the territory - they enhance innovation, competitiveness and international relations. The Polo Scientifico-Didattico of Cesena realizes projects aimed to increase the quality of higher education, to guarantee suitable services to students, to support the development of research, and to give momentum to relations between universities and companies.
In the last decade, Cesena has become a university city, a centre of high studies and research for thousands of students from all over Italy and from other countries. This important outcome comes from a great dream nourished by local municipal authorities in the last decades - the union of local tradition and history with a high quality academic offer in order to bring up new generations with a highly professional and knowledge standards.

30th July 2009
The focus of this meeting was to finalize the project proposal, now found at Team:BCCS-Bristol/Project . On the modelling side, we delegated GRNs to Petros/Antos, vesicles to Steve, magnetotaxis to Emily and performance/population dynamics to Mattia. Lab work progresses.
3rd July 2009
The project has gained a direction and a lot of work has been done in both modelling and wet-lab aspects. A review of the project and its goals was given to all advisors and views about further work.
We are improving BSim to have a more ""real-life"" feeling. Current progress includes the shape of bacteria and population dynamics.
A copy of the presentation can be found here . The tangible progress in the wetlab is expanded in this presentation found here .
16th July 2009
Discussed the progress of the project. We are currently focused on the vesicle formation part of the project although some steps have been taken in trying to develop magnetotaxis ex vivo.
The relevant presentation can be found here .
9th July 2009
Vesicles with a twist...part II
After a week's worth of digging through the literature we have managed to find possible non-toxic candidate proteins that pack within outer membrane vesicles produced by E.coli. Thus we have settled into implementing directed communication and delivery of proteins of interest between different cells/populations. This will possibly form the bigger part of the project and if time permits we will combine this with our magnetotaxis idea.
With respect to modelling we are interested in developing a useful tool for the community and research by possibly expanding the existing BSim software. For further information visit the modelling page of the wiki.
With respect to the lab we will pursuit the building of biobricks that will allow the implementation of proteins of interest into OMVs (outer membrane vesicles) as a first part to the project. Upon the succesful completion of this first task we want to implement some GRN for the control of responses of both production and/or message acceptance.
A copy of the presentation of this meeting can be found here .
2nd July 2009
Vesicles with a twist
We seem to have settled down to the idea that implementing magnetotaxis in vivo in E.coli will be infeasible within the given time-frame. Instead we have decided to move in the direction where we will try implementing the usage of vesicles in our project.
We are still thinking of perhaps implementing magnetotaxis combined with bacteria in an in vitro manner.
26th June 2009
Bacterial diagnosis
Ollie and Thanasis spent some time this week looking into whether we could use bacteria to detect and report on the state of an organism. It now seems we have now dropped the idea on the grounds it is too similar to projects attempted in previous years (NYMU, KULeuven) and would require licensing. However there was a suggestion that this idea could be taken in the direction of sequence based toggle switches to carry out a (more complicated) decision tree based diagnosis.
Magnetic bacteria
Petros prepared some slides on the biological feasibility of engineering E.coli to synthesize magnetosome (Copy of the presentation found here)
Links to the papers cited in the presentation can be found here:

Steve and Emily looked into possible applications of magnetotaxis. These papers seem particularly interesting:
Controlled manipulation and actuation of micro-objects with magnetotactic bacteria
Towards Autonomous Bacterial Microrobots
Other publications by Sylvain Martel
Vesicles
Tom gave a presentation developing the idea of communication and self-assembly using vesicles .
18th June 2009
The shortlist was down to 7 projects and 3 of those made it to the next round as voted by the present audience. These are as follows (project title, (votes received)):
Magnetic Bacteria (10)
Bacterial Vesicles (6)
Non-Invasive Reporting/Switches & Sensors (6)
Genome Updates & version control (5)
Host/Parasite Symbiosis (3)
Bacterial Computation

Thus the top three were chosen to review the literature further and assess the possibility of carrying each out in 3 months.
11th June 2009
Kick off meeting. Narrowed down ideas from ~15 to 7. See Team:BCCS-Bristol/Brainstorming .
2nd June 2009

Magnetosomes
Some prokaryotic organisms have membrane bound organelles within their cell which contain single crystal ferromagnetic material known as magnetite (Fe3O4). If the gene can be manipulated and expressed in E.Coli then the possibilities of applications for single crystal magnetic material are endless ranging from medicine to the industry. Many species have magnetic properties but the most studied are from prokaryotic organisms of aquatic nature and are of the genus of magnetotacticum.
Bacterial versioned upgrades
Have the ability for bacteria to naturally propogate updates to syntheic GRNs that need updating.
Vesicle Secretion
Hormone signalling and plasmids have limited capabilities in communication and signalling. Hormone - diffusive and not fast and limited radius of communication.
By packing chemicals in vesicles u can extend the radius of communication and increase signalling. Also you can design exclusive communication schemes by specialised recognition from bacteria.
RNA Editing & Reverse Trascription (Turing machine)
RNA Editing
Creating a similar editing that occurs in eukaryotic cells where splicing can give different permutations of a protein (or in this case different proteins).  This can be implemented by testing the functionality of current eukaryotic proteins in bacteria or by implementing a scheme from scratch that does a similar function (restriction enzyme usage?)
This can then self-insert into the genome at desired locations by homologous recombination.
Reverse Trascription
Attempt to translate the principlies of Turing Machines in bacterial organisms to allow for the creation of an adaptive genome using both RNA Editing and Reverse Transcription. This can be affected by environmental factors. Also this is a useful mechanism for reducing basal transcription levels in gene networks.
Synthetic Proteins (Dek's Lab)
Using completely lab designed proteins and implementing them along with natural proteins found in bacterial cells to carry out novel functions.
Viral Coat Modifications
Viruses assembly their protein coats by using certain geometric monomers (e.g triangular) of proteins to create different shapes (dodecahedrons,icosa-hedrons). One can model and exploit the thermodynamics and geometry to create novel shapes or extend the volume of the protein coat to allow for extended capacity in terms of DNA or proteins/biologics.
VERY VERY VERy VEry Very very hard !
Actin Modification/Movement
Try to mimick the actin polymerisation and cytoskeletal arrangements of eukaryotic cells into bacteria to try and promote movement into specific directions or affect the shape of bacterial cells.
Improving/Completing Previous iGEM Networks
Simply taking previous iGEM networks that almost work but do not, due to the team running out of time etc, and just finishing them off, ideally in as automated fashion as possible, or under some general technique of completing networks i.e. you try to see what the main reasons where for the networks not functioning correctly, and then concentrate on the the biggest group, and come up with a general method of fixing that problem. good points are, most of the lab work is done, and potentially allows a large number of new networks to be created.
Multi-Functional Networks
This could be done in a number of possible ways:
!Inherent Multi-functionality Creating networks that have two or more distinct useful behaviours/functions dependent on the input into the network.
!Exploiting Stochastic Coherence Network dynamics can vary depending on the number of copies of the network that are present in the cell. Therefore it is should be possible to create networks whose function changes depending on the nunmber of copies that are present.
!Controlling Dynamics Through Temperature - Arrenhius Relationship for Rate Constants.  Rate constants are dependent on temperature through the Arrenhius equation. Therefore it may be possible to design networks whos function depends on the temperature of the network environment. Numerous applications here.
!Concentration Modification.  In a mass action formalism of chemical reaction there are rate constants and concentrations. Therefore in addition to modifying rate constants through temperature, one could modify the behavior/function by modifying the concentration of the network components. That is, you get the network doing one function with a certain constant input, then maintaining that input, you switch on a gene which modifys the level of a network component(s), which then switches the behaviour/function of the network. In essence, having two functions for one input.
Switches/Sensors
Potential use as a non-invasive toxin detection mechanism for organisms. Put a number of existing detection networks into one bacteria, which you then pass through an organism, and analyse them for the presence of the toxin(s) in the organism.
Symbiosis - Host/Parasite Symbiosis
Find two toxins, one which bacteria sense better than yeast and another that yeast sense better than bacteria, but both which they have a response that protects themselves again the toxin. Then create an interface by whch the bacteria inform the yeast when they detect the toxin theyu are more sensitive to, and the yeast inform the bacteria when they sense the toxin that they are more sensitive to.
Bacterial computation
Can we come up with a simple problem, like the ones solved by the Davison team, to be solved by our bacteria?
Perhaps the Majority problem ?

Error Correction
Would it be possible for a population of bacteria to always maintain specific proportions that are in different states.
Simulated Economy
Using a population of bacteria as a way to simulate the highly distributed economy.
Modelling Projects
Although modelling will form a vital part of understanding how the wetlab GRN will behave it would be interesting to carry out some additional modelling into some novel area that has not previously been considered. This will then allow us to add to the toolbox of methods we are developing to help the sythetic biological engineer in the design process. Need to make sure this is aligned to the interests and abilities of the team to ensure the best possible outcome is achieved.
GRN Modelling
As a GRN is likely to form the biggest part of the project we will need to carry out some modelling of its dynamics. This could include ODE models, bifurcation analysis, stochastic simulation or other novel techniques we find.
BSim Version 2.0
Continuing on for the work done in 2008 there are several extensions to BSim that could be performed to improve accuracy and performance on large scale simulations. These include:
Incorporate GRN Dynamics - Currently the state of a cell is determined using very simple discrete rules. It would be possbile to incorporate ODE type GRN models to give detailed information about the protein/mRNA concentrations over time for each cell. One possible method would be to create a plugin for MATLAB that would allow for a model to be accessed by BSim and for it to provide environmental information such as signalling chemical concentrations. Alternatively, a simple ODE solver could be written in Java and the models transferred directly to BSim which would remove any dependancy on having MATLAB available and may work better for running on high performance clusters.
Population Dynamics - Bacteria in BSim version 1 are immortal! Unfortunately in real life a bacterium version of the ""highlander"" has yet to be found and so the dynamics of population growth and death can be important. Adding population dynamics could be achieved through simple rules for bacteria duplication or more advanced methods based on nutrient distribution and use could be sought. This is probably the easiest out of the extensions to implement as it is merely creating new elements during the simulations which is very simple.
Large Scale Computations - Multi-threading is used by BSim to help improve the performance of a simulation running on a single computing node. This does not, however, provide any advantage when the available computer resources are in a cluster form. In 2008 this did not matter as we wanted to run large numbers of simulations to gain statistical results. If instead you wanted to run on humoungous simulation with millions of bacteria it would run relatively slowly. One extension that would allow for this limitation to be removed would be including support for message passing computing architectures such as MPI . These allow for parts of the program to run on physically separated machines that are co-ordinated by messages sent between each of the machines during execution. There are Java libraries which give access to this technology, however, this is a fairly large undertaking as parallel computation has a lot of gotchas and some large changes would be required in BSim to fully support this. If undertaken it would then allow in theory for simulations will millions of bacteria to run a reasonable time (e.g. days not years!) but if the project is not concerned with populations of bacteria it may not be that useful to support the wetlab project.
Considering that the code is in good shape the effort to implement at least one of these extensions would be fairly simple and allow for a lot of previous effort to be utilised. It also should allow for yet more pretty videos to be generated which always go down well in presentations.
Diffusion Modelling
Before synthesising a gene network in the lab, one creates a computer model of the network in order to assess whether the network is likely to function when synthesised, and for what parameter values (transcription rates, translation rates etc etc) the network is most likely to function for. However, it is commonly accepted that current models of gene networks are quite poor at predicting the dynamics of the real network. This is of course because the model is a necessary simplification of the real network, and one cannot represent or even know all the features of the real system. The logical (and current) approach is to start with as simple model as possible, and then add in detail when the experimental results from the synthesised network differ significantly from the modelling results, suggesting that there is a discrepancy between the model representation and the real situation that leads to the model giving prediction of the dynamics that are qualitatively or quantitatively incorrect to a degree that makes the model practically useless. This project would, based on knowledge from those who understand the real systems well (Claire, Nigel etc), involve picking a process of the real system that is common to all GRNs, that which an increase in the accuracy of the representation of that process in the model would be predicted to lead to the greatest increase in correlation between model and experimental dynamics.
One possibility is the representation of the diffusion of network components within the cell. That is, at the moment there appears to have been no consideration of whether an accurate representation of the diffusion of the networks and the transcription factors of the GRN can significantly increase the predictive power of a GRN mode. One approach would involve creating a sophisticated model of protein and plasmid diffusion within E.coli, that could be combined with a standard ODE model of the rest of the network components. However, this may be computationally intractable for large networks, so another approach may be to attempt to create, based on a simulations and theory, a way of estimating the delay parameter between production of a transcription factor and its reaching its target. This will of course be a distribution, but it is the mean that would be required. Currently delay parameters are used in some instances, although these are free parameters that are optimised to match the network dynamics with what is seen experimentally. If we could go from first principles, and give some a priori values for these parameters it could either speed up the optimisation process, or remove the need for it all together.
This would be attempted for a very simple network comprising two genes; One that produced a transcription factor in response to an external stimulus that we can control, and another that produces a GFP reporter in response to this transcription factor. Experimentally, we would need to be able to measure, on a single-cell level, the time between the addition of the stimulus, and the production of the GFP (one copy would be fine). If this could be done one a large enough scale, then a distribution of `stimulus addition to GFP production' times could be obtained.
We would hope that if we compared a standard ODE model with delays (that we optimise in the standard fashion), to our ODE-Diffusion hybrid or time-delay estimation technique, we would see an increase in terms of the correlation between the predictions of the distribution of times of the model, and the distribution of times in the experiment, when we use our model relative to the standard optimisation process.
The issue with this is that as the network is so simple, the optimisation process has a big advantage i.e. on a simple network it should be easy to find parameters that match the experimental data as we only have one link. The problem with optimisation comes when there are a large number of time-delay parameters to tune, and is where the approach outlined here may come in useful, although this would require a larger network that would be much harder to optimise on. This is possibly feasible if a network is used that has been created elsewhere.
Anyway, diffusion modelling is only one possible process that when modelled far more accurately could provide significant accuracy/predictive power increases. Others have not yet been considered.
Statistical Mechanics
Again coming from the complexity perspective, are there any aspects for synthetic biology that lend themselves to modelling through statistical mechanics. There are a few papers that have used it to look a bacteria movement (chemotaxis), however, are there intercellular processes that may be amenable to this approach?

Molecular Genetics
I've recently completed my BSc in Molecular Genetics and will be entering the Engineering program in the fall of 2009.  Most of my growing-up took place in the small town of Cochrane, Alberta.  My ultimate goals consist of working in the Biotechnology or health care industry.  While my interest in music, movies, snowboarding, and hanging out with friends may seem stereotypical on the surface, they feel unique in their own right and keep me busy most of the time.  This will be my first year on the U of A iGEM team and I am excited to help take the competition to a new level.  I think that iGEM will be a great experience because it demands innovation and collaboration on levels rarely seen in undergraduate programs.
Eric Bennett
Electrical Biomedical Engineering
I am entering my final year of engineering at the U of A.  After graduation, I hope to do research either with a biotechnology company or in grad school.  I think that iGEM is a great way to gain valuable experience and is an effective way of accelerating the field of synthetic biology.  My interests include brain-machine interfacing, genetic engineering, and robotic control systems.  My hobbies include playing guitar, video games, the occasional sport, reading, and fixing my car.
Max Buchko
Honors Biochemistry
I am in my third year of Honors Biochemistry and wish to pursue a career in medicine.  In my time away from the lab I enjoy a wide variety of sports including soccer, boxing, and rifle silhouette shooting.  I have also been known to strum a chord or two at an intolerable volume to the annoyance of the people living upstairs. I hope for the best with iGEM at MIT in 2009.  This competition is a means of proving yourself at an exemplary level amongst many of the top international minds, and it is this challenge that I look forward to the most.
Oscar Cortés
Bsc. Specialization molecular genetics
My future plans include entering into a Masters program in Medical Genetics or Human Genetics, and pursuing this discipline towards a PhD.  I enjoy reading books about the human genome and advancements in stem cell research.  In my spare time I like to play a variety of sports that I am not necessarily good at: soccer, softball, and dodge ball.  I see iGEM as an extraordinary opportunity for me to be exposed to real life research, in which my knowledge of molecular genetics will be challenged, and will help me further my  understanding of Synthetic Biology.

Anh Dao
Biological Sciences and Chemistry
I am interested in a research career after I finish my degree.  I am leaning towards the field of Microbiology to study the many micro-organisms that have not yet been discovered.  However, I may enroll in graduate studies after my undergraduate degree to expand my knowledge and gain more experience in the laboratory.  Being in a competitive team and atmosphere is a motivating and exciting opportunity that I do not want to miss out on.  By creating the smallest artificial E. coli genome we can extend future research.  We are attempting to understand and standardize the E. coli genome so that this methodology can be applied to more complex model organisms.
Uchechukwu Davidson
Honors biochemistry
I am in my final year of Biochemistry at the University of Alberta.  I wish to pursue a career in medicine after my degree.  I enjoy sports, movies, and music at my time away from studies.  The iGEM provides an opportunity to experience  creativity, innovation, and ingenuity which are sometimes absent at the undergraduate level of science.
Youness Elkhalidy
Honors immunology and infection
I am a first year student at the University of Alberta.  I hope to enter medical school in the near future.  I am currently taking part in mitotic-spindle regulation research from a genetics perspective.  I have a passion for science and enjoy sports such as basketball and soccer.  iGEM is an great learning experience not only in the cutting-edge field of Synthetic Biology but also in leadership and business management.  I will enjoy taking part in research that combines many fields of science as well as socialize with many of my team members who share common interests.
Justin Fedor
BSc. Honours Biochemistry
I have completed my undergraduate degree in Biochemistry this year and have began my PhD studies this September.  I play piano and am attempting to learn the cello.  My nerdy tendencies are obvious when I say that I like Star Trek TNG but not DS9.  Last summer I worked in the biomedical research lab of Dr. Larry Unsworth of the National Institute for Nanotechnology (NINT), which has further piqued my interest in the field of nanotechnology.  In the hopefully not too distant future I plan on becoming a researcher studying the mechanisms of membrane bound enzymes, particularly oxidoreductases. iGEM has proved a fantastic experience, it has served to mature me further as a scientist.
Jason Gardiner
BSc. Specialization in Botany
Jason is a veteran of iGEM 2007, where his team ""The Butanerds"" won first place in the Energy track.  His hobbies include Softball, Beach volleyball, soccer, as well as playing the guitar and fiddling with the iGEM 2009 Wiki.  Jason has applied to continue his education in graduate studies at the University of Alberta in 2010.  His degree in Botany focuses mostly on the molecular side of plants and he hopes to use this knowledge applying Synthetic Biology to plants. One day he hopes to solve all of the world's problems using plants and Synthetic Biology.
Erin Garside
Biological Sciences
I completed my BSc. degree this year and plan to do graduate work in biochemistry.  After that - who knows?  I think iGEM will be a great experience, and that it's about time Synthetic Biology really took off.  In my spare time I like to read, play computer games (especially the Sims) and raise cats.
Boris Henriquez
Biological Sciences
I have just completed the third year of my BSc. degree.  My favorite classes so far have been in the fields of Biochemistry and Genetics.  I am most interested in human development and embryogenesis and hope to learn more about these topics in my fourth year.  My ultimate goal is to have a career in the medical industry as both a physician and as a researcher.  When I'm not busy with school or work my usual activities are pretty standard.  I like to hang out with friends and family and I crave the outdoors.  This is my first year with iGEM and I'm really excited to learn more about Synthetic Biology.
Stephen Jahns
Molecular Genetics
I am in my second year at the University of Alberta.  After taking a year of engineering, I decided to transfer to molecular genetics in order to fulfill my childhood desire of creating an army of giant bat-rabbits.  I plan on going on through to graduate school to earn a PhD in order to reach my goals.  In my spare time I like to run around, ride my bike, play music, cook delicious food, and pretty much all the other fun things kids are doing these days.  In my first year I helped to build a car with the U of A's Formula SAE fabrication team.  I had a good time building stuff out of metal, and this year I know that I'm going to have a blast building (or at least attempting to build) a novel organism out of DNA parts.
Eric Leung
Honors Pharmacology
I am currently in my final year of an Honors Pharmacology degree. What I do after this degree is up in the air but it is definitely something in the health sciences. In my spare time, I like to play basketball, badminton, run, and catch up on TV shows. Soon I hope I can become a professional baker in my free time.  Traveling to Europe, Mexico, and Japan is also in the books somewhere along the way.
David Lloyd
Biochemistry
I am a fourth year student, studying at the University of Alberta.  While Biochemistry is my major, I have many interests including Genetics, Immunology, Cell Biology, Bioinformatics, and Microbiology.  In my spare time I can be found playing sports like soccer, volleyball, or squash, as well as playing piano, listening to music, and playing video games.  In the future, I hope to continue into a graduate program in Biochemistry, Cell Biology, Synthetic Biology, or in another field.  iGEM is of great interest to myself because of its application to the future of Synthetic Biology.  It is an awesome challenge which will hopefully help me to cultivate myself.
Enoch Ng
Biological Sciences/Business
I am entering my fourth year of studies at the University of Alberta, and am looking forward to the challenge that iGEM provides.  In the future I hope to travel across the world and meet people ranging from Meshaal to Obama and remain a glorified generalist.
Emera Nguyen
BSc. Biological Sciences/Economics
I am a BSc student entering my fourth year in a Biological Sciences major and Economics minor.  This year will be my second year on an iGEM team, and my first year representing the U of A team.  In my downtime, things I enjoy include spending quality time with friends and family and traveling to lesser-known parts of the world.  One year's experience later, the iGEM competition still impresses me with the unique opportunities it provides for student growth.  This research competition is one of the highlights of my undergraduate experience.
Mitch Paquette
BSc. Honors Molecular Genetics
I have transfered into the honors program in Molecular Genetics from a BSc General program in Physical Sciences.  After my degree is completed I plan to apply to graduate studies in Molecular Biology, after which I hope to work in research or academia.  What excites me most about iGEM is the opportunity to gain research experience in such a new field.
Amber Paul
BSc. Specialization Immunology and Infection
I plan to find the cure for cancer.  Seriously.  Will be attending graduate school to earn a PhD following my undergraduate degree.  I would like to live somewhere warm that allows me to do research, preferably Maui.  iGEM is a developmental forefront to Synthetic Biology, something that I love to be part of.  Its challenging and fun.  To be able to determine the minimal genes for a simple prokaryote, we provide a scaffold to future research on larger, more complex cells such as cancerous tissues, simple eukaryotes, etc.
Julia Pon
Honors Molecular Genetics
My future plans include pursuing PhD in Medical Genetics.  I've worked in biological research labs for the past two summers, with last summer spent at the German Cancer Research Institute in Heidelberg, Germany.  I'll be working in both the iGEM lab and a Medical Genetics research lab during summer 2009.  My heritage is a mixture of English, Chinese, and Danish.  iGEM helps move biology to a streamlined, standardized, abstracted process that opens the door to interdisciplinary collaborations and new applications.  I'm excited about the many applications of Synthetic Biology and am enjoying the student-directed and team-oriented nature of iGEM.
Alina Ponomarev
Biological Sciences
I am currently a second year student in Biological Sciences and I am considering transferring into the Immunology and Infection program for my third year. I joined iGEM at the end of my first year and can honestly say that it has been an unbeatable learning experience. It is very exciting to think that the progress we have made can positively impact synthetic biology and society in general. In the future, my career goal is to become a Pediatrician. However, after doing labwork at the iGEM lab this summer, I have begun to consider a career in medical research.
Kelly Robinson
Hon. Biochemistry
I completed my BSc. in Biochemistry this year and have enrolled in the University of Alberta's Chemical Engineering program in hopes of fusing the fundamental science of biological machines with the entrepreneurial world of engineering.  I got involved in iGEM a couple of years ago when I went to a presentation put on by one of the past teams.  I ended up applying in the middle of the night on the last day of registration.  That said, it has been a great experience ever since.  I'm glad that this year I get the opportunity to do some full time work and really get into the project.  Overall, iGEM has a lot to offer anyone who gets involved (including incorrigible advisors: you know who you are!).
James Rodway
Electrical Engineering
I am currently finishing up a co-op Electrical Engineering degree, and am aiming to do some graduate work in more of the computer area, specifically modeling.  At the University, I've been involved with the ARVP and iGEM. I haven't really had much time for hobbies in a while, but when I did I played more video games, the guitar, and I actually read books for entertainment value.  During my time on last year's iGEM team I found that it was a pretty cool multidisciplinary project, which drew in a few different disciplines that I have never really interacted with previously.  It was very impressive to see what we, and all the iGEM teams, had accomplished by the end of last year's competition.
Andy Spencer
Honours Biochemistry
In 5 years I see myself on one of two different paths, medicine or oncology research. I grew up in the Okanagan, British Columbia, and love spending my summers at the beach . In my spare time I enjoy playing squash and bouldering.  iGEM to me represents a fundamental value of science as a discipline; that people can from diverse backgrounds with a common interest and curiosity can work as a cohesive team to overcome barriers and problems.
Jonathan Tam
Honors Cell Biotechnology
I have completed my Bachelor's degree in Honors Cell Biotechnology and intend to pursue a degree related to medicine in Germany in the near future.  I am very interested in the fields of Molecular Biology and Immunology.  For the last two years, I have been keeping myself busy studying the development of macrophages in the lab of Dr. Daniel Barreda.  Outside of the lab, I am an avid photographer and downhill mountain biker.  The iGEM competition accelerates the development of Synthetic Biology as a field.  To be a part of our University of Alberta team is an excellent opportunity for collaboration and advancement.
Jennifer Yau
Honors Biochemistry
I am currently in the second year of my undergraduate program with the ultimate goal of attending graduate school to pursue a research career in Geriatric Medicine.  Additional science related activities of mine include my interest in astronomy and promoting science to elementary students through volunteer work.  Otherwise, I dedicate the majority of my free time to the arts of chainmaille, knitting, and jazz/classical piano.  This is my first year on iGEM and I am ecstatic to be partaking in a project that requires such diverse disciplinary backgrounds.  Not only will this be a great learning experience in so many perspectives, but also an opportunity to contribute significant ideas to the ongoing research in Synthetic Biology
Zach Wiltshire
BSc. Specialization in Cell Biology
I am entering into my fourth year in the Cell Biology program at the U of A and have already experienced iGEM once before as a member of the 2008 National Institute for Nanotechnology team.  Through my degree I have found myself to have interests ranging from immunology to both eukaryotic & prokaryotic cellular anatomy & physiology.  I also happen to be very fond of molecules that fluoresce.  My experience with iGEM last year opened my eyes to the possibilities which engineering biological systems can offer.  Over the course of the 2009 competition I hope to have just as many opportunities to learn as I did last year.

Nanobiotechnologies give us the ability to manipulate and sense at the level of individual molecules, with a tremendous potential impact on both human health and the economy. To a large extent, this potential is likely to be realised through the development of Lab on Chip (LOC) technologies. Although the LOC technologies are powerful, the complexity of the infrastructure required to support LOC operation has hindered the widespread adoption of LOC methods in life science applications. A central theme in the work of the Backhouse lab ( the Applied Miniaturisation Lab, AML ) is the development of extremely inexpensive (e.g. $1000) systems for implementing nanobiotechnologies/molecular biology, especially for medical diagnostic applications.

What we did
Advisors:
Eric Lagally was the prime mover for the British Columbia iGEM team.  He started the team in October 2008 and was responsible for organizing the team, seeking internal UBC funding and extramural funding, and handling logistics like space and resources.  He was assisted in these efforts by other advisors and all team members.
Joanne Fox helped write funding requests for internal funding, provided guidance on research direction, and helped set up the computing resources we used in our experiments.  She was also the main contact point between the team and the Advanced Molecular Biology Lab, the teaching lab where a large part of the experiments were performed.
David Ng also co-wrote funding requests, and worked with Joanne and Eric to let us use all of the resources of the AMBL lab during the summer.
Paul Jaschke has been vital to troubleshooting our experiments, being careful not to dictate the direction the experiments should take.  He's also been our administrator, purchasing reagents and supplies, booking rooms, and researching flights.
Students:
Alex Ng was the RNA man in designing parts for the lock/key and jammer subprojects. He spent time working with FACS and RNAFold, and helped Amelia with assemblies.
Amelia Hardjasa assembled the night away for most of the summer, focusing on the lock/key subproject as well as general use assemblies, and then moved on to pBAD promoter characterization in fall. She was also in charge of all parts submissions to the registry.
Calvin Chan was the graphic artist for the team, designing our logo, our shirts, and web templates.  He was also a member of the research team, helping with with various time course measurements on each of the subprojects.
Charles Howes generated a FASTA file containing all biobricks, wrote a program that emulates the biobrick protocol to generate a FASTA file, and wrote a program to draw biobrick diagrams from component pieces.  He also helped Eric Ma design a LIMS for the team, which should be finished sometime in the new year.  Charles was also in charge of the Wiki pages.
Eric Ma was the jack of many trades (note, not all, just many). He proposed the idea of doing a biosensor project, and helped to organize team and journal club meetings. He also helped with experiments, assemblies and other miscellaneous lab stuff. He was the Funding sub-team leader, helping to raise funds from a variety of sponsors. He also did a public speech on synthetic biology, helping to spread the word of iGEM to a large cross-section of the UBC student population.
Hank Yu was open to help out on the different side projects, from 20 hour competent cell making to basic assemblies to early-morning FACS to basic preparation work. He is also keen on spreading the word about iGEM across campus!
Heather Kempthorne was a full-time iGEM team member during the summer months.  Heather worked hard to design, mutagenize, assemble and test the various pBAD promoters.
Janny Ke helped with experiment design, sponsorship, and lab work.
Karen Cheshire helped with experiments as a member of the research team.
Mark Ling helped with experiments as a member of the research team.

A TOUR OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CALGARY iGEM TEAM
As the second stop of our tour, we have an introduction to our team! We are a diverse group of 15 undergraduate students and 4 supervisors from health sciences, engineering, kinesiology, and computer science. Read below for some introductions about us and our fantastic university: The University of Calgary. Afterwards, you can click HERE for the next stop of our tour.
OUR TEAM
UNDERGRADUATES
Prima Moinul
I’ve just completed my first year in Biomedical Sciences at the University of Calgary. I have a strong background in basic cell biology, DNA replication and lab work with E.coli bacteria. As a team leader for iGEM marketing, I will focus on promoting and marketing our project to a larger audience and work with sponsors to fund our project. The idea of a student-run research program immediately caught my attention because it encourages undergrads to work collectively in a group as well as individually to exercise our own creative thoughts, ideas and innovations. I also enjoy the interdisciplinary system of the iGEM project, especially the wet lab and marketing components. Aside from iGEM, I am also actively involved in the community with numerous volunteer activities. In my spare time, I love reading, camping, biking, travelling, and most importantly, shopping! I’m looking forward to working with the team and learning about synthetic biology!
Sung Yong (Kevin) Shin
I am majoring in Biomechanics of Kinesiology. As part of the wetlab section of the team, I am responsible for carrying out biological lab procedures and communicating with both the wetlab and computer modeling groups. I joined because I am interested in the concept of engineering bacteria as well as application of physics and biology. I have always liked playing with legos, which is quite similar to synthetic biology, with some background biology and nerdiness. I am interested in putting parts together in order to make one big system work, such as legos and electrical circuits. Outside of iGEM, my hobbies include hiking, fiddling with electronics, and playing sports. I am quite excited to be working with the iGEM team as it will be my first real opportunity to do research in the biology field.
Katie Ovens
I have just completed my first year of Health Sciences in the Bioinformatics stream. I became interested in iGEM because I saw it as a chance to learn about the emerging field of synthetic biology. Being part of a team environment was also desirable due to this project being my first research experience at the university level. I am interested in working on the implementation of technology in science, and developing my own skills as my educational career progresses. I am working with the Second Life team to construct educational tools to further promote science by using technology. The goal will be to provide a high quality service to a large audience that has the potential to be more personal and effective than traditional teaching methods. It will give me the chance to apply my current computer programming skills as well as learn from the other team members and experience the difference between computational problem solving and traditional laboratory investigation.
Patrick King
My major is in Bioinformatics under the Bachelor of Health Sciences program at the University of Calgary. I was a member of the iGEM team in the University of Calgary's first and second iGEM competitions in 2006 and 2007. In the past, I have worked on the chemotaxis and quorum sensing projects. It's exciting to be back again this year, guiding one of our 2009 projects: online outreach and education via Second Life. I'm most interested in the standardization and characterization aspects of synthetic biology, and I have gained lots of wet-lab and programming experience through my experiences in iGEM.
Carol Chan
I am currently studying chemical engineering with a biomedical engineering specialization at the University of Calgary. Prior to starting my engineering degree, I completed a degree in biomedical sciences. The reason I decided to join the 2009 iGEM team is because the idea of synthetic biology is new and exciting. More importantly, I have the great opportunity to experiment engineering with biology, which is where most of my interests lie. I will also be exposed to collaborative teamwork which is an essential element of engineering. Some of my other interests include sports, sports and more sports. I don't play very many sports, but I sure love watching football and hockey on TV! I also like cooking, learning new recipes from dad and watching movies!
Vicki Komisar
I just wrapped up my fourth year in the University of Toronto’s Engineering Science program, with a specialization in biomedical engineering. I am excited to be back in Calgary and representing my hometown in my first iGEM experience, with a focus on the lab work and modeling. My experience over the last four years has been all across the board, with summer research projects in biomechanics and rehabilitation engineering; as well as coursework that entailed a series of rather nefarious biomedical and nanoparticle-based wet labs. When I’m not satisfying my lust for bacterial genomics, I’m usually either swimming, skating or learning German in preparation for a work placement in Bern, Switzerland. If you’re at the jamboree, come say hi. I’ll even throw in a free horoscope reading for the fun of it! Cheers!
Chinmoyee Mukerji
I am a 3rd year student studying Chemical Engineering at the University of Calgary. This year, I will be helping to promote iGEM alongside the Marketing and Management teams. I joined this team because synthetic biology fascinates me. I believe that it is paving the way for a technological revolution. I hope to increase awareness in the community about synthetic biology and how it may open doors for further advancements through the accomplishments of our iGEM team. Outside of summer work, I enjoy playing the piano. I often sing classical Indian songs. I love painting, sketching- anything involving art!  I also love photography and gardening.
Fahd Mirza
I am in my second year at the University of Calgary and am majoring in Health and Society in the Bachelors of Health Sciences. I love cellular biology and I have taken courses in Biology and Medical Sciences. I have also worked with bacteria in biology labs in my first year. I love cooking and soccer and I am a huge Manchester United fan. I also enjoy volunteering and spending time with my friends. I want to pursue a career in Public Health and work for improving the health and wellness of society. I have strong communication and organizational skills that will also help contribute to the team. I have had marketing experience while volunteering in a hospital in 2006. I helped the marketing department in creating health awareness literature and in organizing health awareness programs. I believe that with my skills and background, I can help the University of Calgary iGEM team achieve its goals.
Emily Hicks
I’ve just finished my first year as a Health and Society student in the Bachelor of Health Sciences program.  I have taken Medical Science and biology courses as well as ethics and Health in Society. I joined the iGEM team because I’m really excited to have the opportunity to work on something that’s novel and part of a very diverse team.  I think synthetic biology is an interesting and powerful field that will only grow in the near future and it’s exciting to be a part of something that may be able to come up with solutions to global problems.  This summer I’m going to be working on the outreach team as well as in the lab and the iGEM wiki.  I will be helping to present our project to high school students to try to build more interest in synthetic biology in Alberta.  In my spare time I compete in highland dancing, play the oboe in the University of Calgary symphonic band and participate in plays with Storybook theatre.
Stefan Marcus
Stefan is a second year Biomedical student currently completing his Bachelor of Health Sciences in the faculty of Medicine. It is the first time he has entered the iGEM competition. As a health science student he has experience in molecular biology as well as important disciplines such as ethics and health in society. He is excited not only to be a part of the Second Life team in creating a virtual educational tool but also to help out with the lab, marketing and outreach components of the project. He hopes to bring the team together with enthusiasm. In his spare time, Stefan likes milksteak, not going to the zoo and writing in third-person.
Jeremy Kubik
I have just finished my second year at the University of Calgary in biomedical sciences in the Bachelor of Health Sciences program. In the summer of 2008, I worked under a private investigator in the field of pulmonary surfactant. This year I am quite excited to be part of the iGEM team primarily because it is student-directed research and as a result, we are encouraged to provide input to the research tasks. This year, I will be part of the wetlab team working on mutant circuits in order to test the overall signaling circuit, and I will also be helping with the iGEM team wiki. I expect to learn about all the relevant laboratory techniques in the field, as well as receive a thorough understanding of the second life and marketing aspects of the project which will be required to ensure the overall team's success. Outside of my interest in biology, I am quite involved in all types of sports, in particular, being part of the U of C Dinos swim team.
Mandy Cheung
I’ve just completed my second year in the Biomedical Sciences program at the University of Calgary. In 2007, I participated in the Sanofi Aventis biotechnology Challenge. This year, as a member of the iGEM team, I will be involved in developing community outreach to educate the community, mostly junior high and high school students about synthetic biology through the creation of a 3D virtual learning environment. I hope to better understand the use of technology in developing initiatives that promote education through exploration. I am excited to work with students from different disciplines to further explore the technology and applications of synthetic biology through multiple aspects, from the mathematical modeling of systems to the marketing of projects. Outside of the iGEM, I’ll most likely be baking, playing video-games, or going out with friends. I believe this summer will be an incredible learning experience. (^▽^) V  - <3
Jamie Feng
Finishing up my first year in the Biomedical Sciences stream of the Health Sciences program, I have taken a smattering of molecular biology courses.  My first iGEM experience this summer will see me helping out with lab and marketing.  The reason I decided to join was the added challenge of doing molecular biology work and adding in aspects of engineering, marketing, outreach and education.  In my two years of previous research work the focus was on molecular biology, ranging from protein isolation to biofilm destruction.  Beyond the iGEM environment, I find myself involved with volunteer organizations such as AIESEC, recreational swimming and computer gaming. ✌
Afshin Esmaeili
I just completed my BSc degree in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Calgary.  I am starting as a grad student in CPSC, under the supervision of Dr. Christian Jacob, working on modeling biological systems using Membrane Computing (MC). My previous research work was on evolution of discrete gene regulatory models and applying heuristic optimization methods toward more stable gene regulatory networks. My research interests are in evolutionary computation, biological modeling and medical sciences. I'll be working with the 2009 iGEM team to help model the Quorum-Coupled Bacteriocin Release system implemented by the wet-lab team using Membrane Computing.
Iman Yazdanbod
I am going into  my second year of Bioinformatics in the Bachelors of Health Sciences program at the U of C. I am working on the computing and modeling aspects of iGEM. I will be working on the visualization of the Membrane Computing Project and I’m also helping to add some visual features to the model designed by Afshin. iGEM is a wonderful opportunity to gain a better understanding of cellular structures and gene expression, and since I am interested in cellular and molecular biology and computer programming, I was drawn into this project. I usually listen to music or socialize with my friends in my free time. Everyday I try to allocate some time to hang out with my family. I also play soccer. I am interested in travelling as well.
FACILITATORS
Thane Kubik
This is my second year as a member of the University of Calgary’s iGEM team. Last year, I was on the University of Calgary Wetware team and I had a blast! I had such a great time that with the help of Sonja, Dr. Jacob and Dr. Nygren, I initiated recruitment for our iGEM team thereby bolstering our ranks from 4 to 16 team members. As a fourth year biomedical student in the Bachelor of Health Sciences program, I approach iGEM as an amazing opportunity to apply some of great biological theory that I have learnt to the design of my own biological systems. This year, as one of the facilitators of the team, I am really enjoying dabbling in all aspects of our project (beyond just the wetlab) including mathematical modeling, marketing, ethics and Second Life. Indeed, incorporating all of these aspects into one complete package represents the most exciting challenge yet!
Sonja Georgijevic
I have B.Sc. degree in Cellular, Molecular and Microbial Biology, and M.Sc. in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, both from the University of Calgary. Currently, I am a Ph.D. student in Educational Technology. For the past three years I have been teaching third year undergraduate courses in molecular biology in the University of Calgary Bachelor of Health Sciences program. I have also been involved with University of Calgary iGEM teams, acting as laboratory supervisor and facilitator since the summer of 2006. It is my involvement with iGEM that prompted my interests in undergraduate science education and educational technology. I am interested in developing educational tools for teaching undergraduate level science.
Dr. Christian Jacob
I received my Ph.D.  in Computer Science from the University of Erlangen-Nuremberg, Germany. In July 1999, I joined the Department of Computer Science (Faculty of Science).  Since August 2003, I also hold a joint appointment with the Department of Biochemistry & Molecular Biology(Faculty of Medicine), where I am the Director of Bioinformatics in the Bachelor of Health Sciences  Program. I lead the Evolutionary & Swarm Design (ESD) research group of the Artificial Intelligence Laboratory. Weare investigating how to apply evolutionary, swarm and collective intelligence techniques in various application domains. So far, the ESD research group has built computer simulations and visualizations of systems such as traffic flow, biomolecular interactions,and swarm architectures. Our project details can be found at the ESD website . I have written two books on evolutionary computing and natural programming paradigms: Principia Evolvica (dpunkt, Heidelberg, 1997; in German) and Illustrating Evolutionary Computation with Mathematica (Morgan Kaufmann, San Francisco, 2001). For the fourth year, I am acting as one of the facilitators for the UofC iGEM team.
Dr. Anders Nygren
I have a PhD from Rice University, Houston, Texas, and MSc degrees from the University of Houston and the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm, Sweden. Since 2004, I am an Assistant Professor in the Centre for Bioengienering Research & Education and the Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering at the University of Calgary. My main research interests deal with the electrophysiology of the heart, using a combination of experimental measurements and computer modeling. I realized a couple of years back that many of the modeling methods used in my research also can be applied to an area I knew nothing about at the time: Synthetic Biology. This is the second year I have been involved in iGEM and, like last year, I think it is fair to say that I have learned more from the team members than anyone has learned from me! We have several Engineering students on the team this year and I am sure there will be even more in future years. The Biomedical Engineering Program here at the U of C is only a few years old, but we already have a great momentum going with lots of great students.
THE UNIVERSITY OF CALGARY
The University of Calgary was founded in 1966 and since then has become one of the top research institutions in Canada. The wide range of Bachelor programs in 16 faculties and 36 research centers offer the almost 20,000 undergraduate students a large array of resources to develop their personal and professional lives in order to become successful. The iGEM team worked in well-equipped laboratories such as those found in the O'Brien Center and in Michael Surette's laboratory in the Health Sciences Center.

ALL ABOUT US
Hello there, be my guest as I give you a quick peep at my team. It all started in early July when all interested candidates were asked to gather up for a meeting regarding iGEM and eventually 7 students showed up. As time passed by the number decreased exponentially and now we are left with 3 team members. And may I not officially but rationally declare us as the smallest iGEM team for 2009. That does not mean we are any weaker as each member’s workmanship, enthusiasm and self believe cannot be doubted but driven towards a successful iGEM team.
We are supported by various personalities from different department in the university. Their combined knowledge and advice is always’ well appreciated and as well; makes us a much stronger integrity.
HOW WE OPERATE
The two main heads of the project are Professor Philip Wright and Professor Visakan Kadirkamanathan. Any main issues regarding the project are dealt by them. Then comes the supportive postgrads; Jagrob Pandhal and Josselin Noirel who help us out in the biology based aspects, while Tara Baldacchino covers the modelling bit.

The Student Lineup
Parthiv Amin
Nickname: Parthon=Python/francium phosphide (Fr3P) / fatal attrACTION
Program: B.Sc. BioChemical Engineering 2011
QGEM Position: Student Volunteer/Webmaster
About: I am currently entering my third year in BioChemical Engineering at Queen's University. I garnered an interest in iGEM due to my fascination of the field of biofuels, especially the use of engineered algal strains for biodiesel production. As a volunteer member of the QGEM, my focus is mostly on the technological aspects of iGEM: maintaining the Wiki, compiling data, and animations. Outside of QGEM I'll be working on the Queen's BAJA SAE car, as well as getting some of the paperwork filed for a new chemical engineering design team a few of my friends and I are developing. In my free time I'll be playing my guitar & Halo 2, surfing the net, and of course doing a metric tonne of homework.
Michael Freeman
Nickname: The Naked Sasquatch / Microbicurious
Program: B.Sc. BioChemical Engineering 2010
QGEM Position: Student Employee
About: I am in my fourth year at Queen's after transferring degree programs from chemistry to biochemical engineering. iGEM is a competition that grabbed my interest immediately because of the unbelievable possibilities synthetic biology makes available. Solving problems in general is incredibly interesting to me, and solving them in unconventional or obscure ways is even more exciting. I came into iGEM with a few project ideas like including engineered microbes in specific waste water treatment processes, creating a more conclusive indicator test for aggressive prostate cancers, and creating some microbial suspension which could be ingested and used to break down cellulose in the human stomach, a hugely abundant source of food and energy. For iGEM this year I was a 'wet labber' responsible for creating, engineering and testing our Heme/Heme-Oxygenase system which would be used as one of our plaque degrading effectors. In order to keep from going nuts from talking with bacteria all day I bar tend at night, I compete in triathlons and varsity rowing for Queen's, I am deeply in love with traveling and hosting travelers, and I have just entered the wonderful (and expensive) world of skydiving! Ever touched a cloud? This guy has.
Jonas Elliott Gerson
Nickname: Sex Pili

QGEM Position:
About: More to come later
James MacLeod
Nickname: Bond
Program: B.Sc.H. Biology
QGEM Position: Co-Founder
About: I am currently in my third year at Queen's University pursuing a Bachelor's of Science (BScH). I was born in Britain, lived in the Middle East for a period, and now reside in Canada. I love the skiing that Canada has to offer, and I'm very excited that Queen's will be participating in the 2009 Jamboree and am looking forward to meeting teams from across the world!
Bogdan Momciu
Nickname: The Count
Program: B.Sc.H. Life Sciences SSP 2010
QGEM Position: Student Employee
About: I am 4th year student in the Queen's University Life Sciences program with a focus towards research and biomedical applications. Once I heard about iGEM I was greatly enthusiastic about the idea due to the sheer number of innovations this kind of cooperative initiative could end up producing. During this past summer I worked on the design and synthesis of our SAA and Endothelial Cell Binding Constructs as well as testing and troubleshooting. In my spare time I like to play a variety of sports including hockey, soccer, and volleyball.
Chris Palmer
Nickname: FRECsecutioner
Program: B.Sc. Engineering Chemistry 2012
QGEM Position: Student Volunteer
About: I am a second year student in the Engineering Chemistry program at Queen's university, but I have always had a strong interest in microbiology and biochemistry as well.  As a result, I was intrigued by the opportunities presented by the iGEM competition.  As soon as I heard that Queen's was forming an iGEM team, I knew that I wanted to be a part of it and help get it off the ground in its first year.  I have thoroughly enjoyed my time this summer working with everyone else on the team, and I look forward to meeting people and hearing about everyone's exciting projects at the jamboree!
Bryant Shum
Nickname: Blossom
Program: Life Science SSP 2011
QGEM Position: Student Employee
About: I am currently a third year undergraduate student at Queen's, with a concentration in Life Science. Given the nature of my studies, I have always been fascinated by the sheer variety of phenotypes that can arise from a simple genetic code; therefore, the chance to play ""Lego"" with these complex molecules of life was an irresistible opportunity for me. Specifically, my role on the team this year was to help construct the genetic components required for plaque binding, as well as to conduct background research on the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. And, so far, this has proven to be a challenging but unforgettable project.
Kate Turner
Nickname: Chicken Joe / The Octagon
Program: B.Sc. BioChemical Engineering 2010
QGEM Position: Student Employee
About: I am in my fourth year of a chemical engineering degree at Queen’s, focusing on the biomedical stream. I spent last summer working as a field engineer in the Alberta oil patch, but this year I wanted to broaden my horizons and focus on biotechnology or biomedical research. I was especially interested in iGEM due to the wide-ranging applications of synthetic biology – from smog cleanup to combating tumours to degrading plastics – and now I hope to continue in this field after graduation. During the summer I worked in one of the labs testing the heme/HO-1 effector system and researching the amelioration of atherosclerotic plaques by CO, HO-1, and biliverdin. Outside of QGEM, I spent my summer camping, BBQing, and reading like a fiend.
Christopher Yan
Nickname: YanTASTIC
Program: B.Sc.H. Life Sciences 2012
QGEM Position: Student Employee
About: I am a second year Life Sciences student at Queen's University. This is my first time participating in an event of such grand scale and am very much looking forward to the Jamboree.
Harry Zhou
Nickname: Bubbles
Program: B.Sc.H. Biochemistry 2011
QGEM Position: Co-Founder
About: I am a third-year Biochemistry student at Queen’s University. Starting in high school, I had a strong interest in biotechnology that has the potential of benefiting health care and environment. When I was in grade 12, a professor at University of Calgary introduced me to synthetic biology and the iGEM competition and I volunteered for the UCalgary team in 2007. I thoroughly enjoyed the experience and was fascinated by the iGEM program, which provides a platform for students to tackle important problems concerning the environment, health care, and new technology. This was why I decided to put together a multidisciplinary team of undergraduate students at Queen’s to participate in this year’s iGEM competition. I had tons of fun this summer planning and carrying out experiments for the project and working with students from other discipline. In my spare time, I like to play sports, guitar, and read.

3.4 Matthew “Ultraman” Hall
3.5 Malinka Walaliyadde
3.6 Kevin “Amoeba” Cheng
Team Description
The Cornell iGEM team is a multidisciplinary team with 6 undergraduates with bioengineering, material science, biology and chemistry majors. Our rookie year has been an empowering year where the traditional listeners of knowledge have become creators.
Advisors
Carl Batt: Professor, Food Science
Maki Inada: Adjunct Professor, Molecular Biology and Genetics
John D. Helmann: Professor, Microbiology
Xiling Shen: Assistant Professor, Electrical and Computer Engineering
Undergrads
Xing “Xingularity” Xiong
Born in the ghettos of the LHC (Large Hadron Collider), Xing Xiong had an aptitude for physics and hardcore rapping.  He was spitting out rhymes by the age of two and three quarters, and upon reaching high school, was dubbed “Xingularity” by his peers.  Xing brought his rhymes to Cornell, and during his interview for joining the Cornell GEM team, his rap performance was so phenomenal that he immediately took over as Team Leader, no questions asked.
Bernard “Big Ben” Cammarata
Originating from the small town of Southborough, Massachusetts, Ben always had big things on his mind.  Like real big.  Cornell big.  After being accepted into Cornell in 2007 (he is currently a junior BEE major), Ben set his sights on curing all the world’s problems.  How did he plan on doing this? Well, establishing a universal dictatorship solely under his control did not work out so well, so he decided to join the Cornell Genetically Engineered Machines team instead.
Alyssa “Adrenaline” Henning
Born in the town of Bakersfield, California, Alyssa rode her first roller coaster at the age of six months.  Her second roller coaster ride is scheduled for when she gets off her first; she has been riding the same roller coaster continuously for her entire life.  Somehow, she managed to ace high school, get accepted into Cornell, and join the iGEM team, all from the seat of her 3 by 3 coaster car.  How does she go to the bathroom?  It’s a very simple process: magic.  Since she is unable to leave her coaster car, she will be sending a surrogate to the jamboree in her place.
Matthew “Ultraman” Hall
Matthew Hall, born on the rings of Saturn, is the most interesting man in the world.  At the age of three, he ran his first ultramarathon (100 miles), earning the same “Ultraman.”  At the age of five, he cured world hunger, only to uncure it when someone stole is nachos.  At the age of 10, he counted to infinity, twice.  At the age of 18, he was accepted into one of the most prestigious schools in world.  Matthew Hall’s tears can cure cancer, but sadly, he has never cried.
Malinka Walaliyadde
Malinka was born in Sri Lanka. He doesn’t have a nickname because there was no one around to nickname him when he invented the universe.
Kevin “Amoeba” Cheng
Kevin reproduced asexually, creating his present day form and earning him the nickname “Amoeba.”  Unfortunately, his identical copy was washed down a laboratory sink before it could fully develop, so there is only one Kevin “Amoeba” Cheng.  Look for the amoeba at the jamboree.

SBOL-V
Suzie Bartram, Class of 2012, Undeclared- Engineering. During the summer, Suzie helped design the SBOL-V visual graphics and language. After developing and testing several sets of symbols, she helped release the first compiled set, which can be seen under the team SBOL-V page. She additionally worked on building and characterizing the Anti-Inflammation Device. Her main focus delved into the SoxR- SoxS promtoer pathway; she worked on designing and performing the necessary assays to test this inducible, superoxide sensor. This included testing downstream GFP production when induced with paraquat, characterized on both a high and low copy plasmid.
Suzie's past research experiences include an internship at the McLaughlin Research Institute in the lab of John R. Bermingham, Jr., Ph.D. where she performed in situ hybridization on mouse embryos to study genes related to Schwann cell differentiation and peripheral myelination.

Summary
Our team is an interdisciplinary group composed of biology and mathematics subgroups collaborating between two different campuses, Missouri Western State University (MO) and Davidson College (NC). Missouri Western State University (MWSU) and Davidson College are 1,032 miles/1,660 km apart, so our collaboration involves cyber meetings, wiki postings, Wiggio shared space, Skype communication, and two campus site-visits.
During the first week of our 10 week project, MWSU traveled to Davidson for 5 days to determine what our project would be. During week 10, Davidson traveled to MWSU to produce the wiki, PPT and poster.
Our campuses have no graduate students or postdocs. Our team is composed of 1 high school student and 13 undergraduates majoring in biology, chemistry, mathematics, art, psychology, secondary mathematics education as well as some who have not declared their majors yet. We have sophomores, juniors, and seniors on our team.

I’m an undergraduate student and major in biotechnology. I am very glad to join in 2009 NCTU_Formosa iGEM team in my last semester in collage. Although my research in undergraduate is heart diseases, different from what the team do now. However, this training let me know another way to think of synthetic biology. I hope I will learn more design thoughts and use the thoughts in my future studies.

Peking University is a comprehensive and national key university. The campus, known as ""Yan Yuan""(the garden of Yan), is situated at Haidian District in the western suburb of Beijing, with a total area of 2,743,532 square metres (or 274 hectares). It stands near to the Yuanmingyuan Garden and the Summer Palace.
Peking University is proud of its outstanding faculty, including 53 members of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), 7 members of the Chinese Academy of Engineering (CAE), and 14 members of the Third World Academy of Sciences (TWAS).
The university has effectively combined research on important scientific subjects with the training of personnel with a high level of specialized knowledge and professional skill as demanded by the country's socialist modernization. It strives not only for improvements in teaching and research work, but also for the promotion of interaction and mutual promotion among various disciplines.
Thus Peking University has become a center for teaching and research and a university of a new type, embracing diverse branches of learning such as basic and applied sciences, social sciences and the humanities, and sciences of medicine, management, and education. Its aim is to rank among the world's best universities in the future.

'ello everybody!
My name is Tiffany Saw and I'd like to thank you for coming to my page! Next fall, I will be a freshman at UC San Diego where I will be majoring in Bioengineering: Biotechnology. Last year, I was a member of the UCSF iGEM team (you can check my page from last year if you want more random information about me) and I look forward to seeing most of my teammates and buddies again at the Jamboree!
My hobbies include eating, fencing, taking jumping pictures, and of course - mini-preps! I'm usually a very happy and upbeat person, but this summer I have discovered my worst enemy: mosquitoes. That isn't to say I haven't enjoyed PKU - the people here are great and I'm very thankful for it. Well, I guess that's all! Goodbye! :]

Motto Freedom through truth for service.
Self Description I joined a neuro-lab in 2008, research on Protein Kinase C function in the process of drug addiction by Conditioned Place Preference experiments. After the study of Biochemistry(metabolism), I became quite interested in the metabolic pathways and regulations. Since I am also interested in programming, For sometime I am fasinated in simulating the metabolic pathways on computer and devoted myself to write a software for building ODE models. The software provides a GUI for input of the variants and parameters, and generate ODE itself. However, the software was aborted because I found too much bug in it, and the core calculation is done by matlab, bugs in calling matlab from java(which I use to write the GUI) can hardly be found. Later, I came to iGEM, and proposed ideas, and that's why I'm writing here. Well, today wiki will freaze, it is 3 am, I'd better finish editing the wiki, I'll write more here if wiki would be reopened.

A Genetic Circuit for Directed Evolution in vivo
Directed evolution is a powerful tool for answering scientific questions or constructing novel biological systems. Here we present a simple genetic circuit for in vivo directed evolution which comprises minimal elements for random mutation and artificial selection. We engineer yeast to generate the DNA mutator hAID, an essential protein in adaptive immunity, and target it specifically to a gene of interest. The target gene will be mutated and consequently promptly evolves. By linking the expression of hAID repressor LacI and favorite gene functionality, the mutation rate inversely correlates between the functionality of the desired gene and hAID. This circuit may be adopted for in vivo evolution in eukaryotic system on genetically encoded targets. It has a variety of potential applications in academic and industrial contexts, theoretically most inter-molecular interaction that involves proteins and RNAs.

Towards Self-differentiated Bacterial Assembly Line
Our projects concern with the ability for bacterial cells to differentiate out of homogeneous conditions into populations with the division of labor. We aim at devices conferring host cells with the ability to form cooperating groups spontaneously and to take consecutive steps sequentially even when the genetic background and environmental inputs are identical. To break the mirror in such homogeneous condition, we need two devices respectively responsible for temporal and spatial differentiation. The implementation and application of such devices will lead to bioengineering where complex programs consisted of sequential steps (structure oriented programs) and cooperating agencies (forked instances of a single class, object and event oriented) can be embedded in a single genome. Although this ""differentiation"" process resemble the development of multicellular organism, we tend to use a more bioengineering style analogy: assembly line. Or maybe after some years from now, this will not be just an analogy.

Being one part of the iGEM society is a wonderful way to learn about what is going on in the field of synthetic biology, how to share your fancy ideas with people and work collaboratively with team members. Besides, it provides fantastic opportunities to make friends with people in other teams and EVEN collaborate internationally. Since the PKU iGEM team was founded in 2007, we have been cooperating with other iGEM teams from different countries and continents. This year we followed this tradition and developed collaboration relationship with 4 iGEM teams.
Exchange Program collaborated with UCSF team
Tiffany(the girl before the whiteborad) with us
This program started in 2008 and allows the two teams exchanging 1 student with each other. Last year, we had Eric Meltzer from San Francisco and sent Dan Lu to UCSF.
This year, Tiffany Saw, a lovely ABC girl who was in UCSF iGEM2008 team, came to Beijing and worked with us for the entire summer. In the lab, she loves mini-preping, drawing cartoons for everybody and taking care of our lab pets. When free of work, she carried her camera around and tried different cuisines in Beijing and then took picture of them. She loves almost everything here in Beijing, including the people, food, historical attractions--but not the cars. Now she has been back to United States and begun her college life at the University of California, San Diego.
Visit to SJTU-BioX-Shanghai team
In the middle of this summer vacation, we paid a visit to Shanghai to meet our new friends, the SJTU-BioX-Shanghai team. Before that, we had already got contact through emails and discussed a lot about the development of iGEM in China. We first arrived in Xuhui Campus and visited labs in SJTU BioX center which sponsors the team. Then we went to the beautiful Minhang Campus (and very huge!) and held a meeting together. Since it is their 1st year in the iGEM family, we shared with them our experience of participating iGEM competition and working on synthetic biology projects. And they told us what they have learned from the workshop at Imperial College. After the meeting, our Shanghai friends guided us to some famous places, such as the Nanjing Road, the Bund and Yu Park, which are typical symbols of Shanghai. We really appreciate their hospitality and cannot wait to see them again at the Jamboree.
Preparing for the meeting
at Yu Park
Help NTU-Singapore and Valencia teams with their surveys
Survey is a valuable approach to obtain public opinions and tendency about specific issues on human practice of synthetic biology. This year, a lot of iGEM teams focus on human practice and some of them invited us to help. We filled out surveys for NTU-Singapore Team and Valencia Team(they honored us a silver medal, as is shown left). Besides, we built up a google group with NTU-Singapore team in order to help each other with experimental problems.
Interaction with Paris team
In June, Prof. Ariel Lindner (supervisor of Paris team) and some French students visited the Center for Theoretical Biology at Peking University. He, Camill and Yann (PhD candidates) attended our team meeting and gave us many beneficial suggestions. The two PhD boys are very friendly and humorous, and as fascinated with football as we do. We played football together and planned for another game at the Jamboree!

About the Team
We are a group of students from Uppsala university and we are all interested in the field of Synthetic Biology. Our group consists of most promising young talents from different education programs. The mixing of international master students of the program in applied biotechnology and the Swedish engineering program in molecular biotechnology gives our team a broad base of knowledge and skills in all sciences that compose the field of synthetic biology.
The Uppsala University has a long history of making valuable contributions in biochemistry and biotechnology. There are many research groups at the university working with projects related to Synthetic Biology. Our team is supported by the department of Photochemistry & Molecular Science (Fotomol).
Here we are, the jolly crew of the Uppsala iGEM team.
Students
Anders Kristoffersson
Anders in the lab
(24) (Sweden) Master student in Molecular Biotechnology
My part in this competition is mainly project development and laboratory work. I like the iGEM competition due to the large degree of freedom it offers us as students to create and explore an idea independently. Having just finished my last courses I am currently searching for a suitable project for my thesis.
Erik Florman
Erik in the lab
(26) (Sweden) Master student in Molecular Biotechnology.
During the project I have worked mainly with laboratory stuff and sponsorship. The best thing about iGEM as I see it, is the freedom and broadness of the project, from actual work in the laboratory to finding sponsors and developing your own ideas.
Karl Brune
Karl in the lab
(21) (Germany) Bachelor Student in Job Creation Oriented Biotechnology at the University of Perugia, Italy
The application of biological knowledge in order to tackle nowadays and future problems has an incredible potential. Thus I decided to dedicate my studies towards Biotechnology. In particular the iGEM competition is a great opportunity for me to realize my own ideas, exchange with people all over the world and to learn more about Synthetic Biology.  My part in the team is the development of the butanol project, the design of the experiments, finding sponsors, brochure, graphics, iGEM Wiki and of course wet lab work.
Ruiqing Ni (part time)
Ruiqing Ni
(23) (China) Master Student Applied Biotechnology
I am Ruiqing Ni from China, and now a Master student of Applied Biotechnology at Uppsala University in Sweden.I participate mainly in the lab work. I like iGEM and our project for it provides us with an opportunity to collaborate with others and get insight into Synthetic Biotechnology.
Jonatan Halvardson - The Modeler
(24) (Sweden) Master student in Molecular Biotechnology
Advisors
Daniel Camsund
Daniel in Hong Kong for SB4.0
(29) (Sweden) PhD student at the Department of Photochemistry & Molecular Science.
Within the greater goal of producing renewable fuels from solar energy, I’m working with the design and implementation of biological tools and systems in the photosynthetic Cyanobacteria. This includes transcriptional and post-transcriptional control, development of standard (BioBrick) plasmids and heterologous expression of hydrogenases (BioModularH2). Additional research interests include RNA-based regulation, GFP in vivo localization and biological model simulations.
Developing and advising team Uppsala-Sweden have provided me with lots of inspiration. The sum of all the late evenings and weekends the team has spent, their innovativeness - both in design and all kinds of problem solving, will surely help to inspire new students, and hopefully, the system and all the novel parts will find their way into the hands of the renewable energy teams of iGEM 2010.

(39) (Germany) Researcher at the Department of Photochemistry & Molecular Science.
Primarily I am interested in using photosynthetic microorganisms such as green algae and cyanobacteria  for the biotechnological production of valuable products, particularly the potential future energy carrier  hydrogen. About 3 years ago I got in contact with the idea of synthetic biology for the first time and saw immediately the big potential of this approach for my research. Then it was just a matter of time to organise the first iGEM team in Uppsala...

I'm a Ph.D. student at the Institute for Cell and Molecular Biology at Uppsala University.  My research pertains to transcription factor regulation of gene activity in the bacterium Escherichia coli accounting for the effects of the major events of the cell cycle, such as volume expansion due to growth, gene dosage variation due to replication, molecule partitioning at cell division and cell aging. Employed in this interdisciplinary work are state of the art experimental and theoretical methodologies. Experimental methods are focused on the molecular cloning and genomic integrations of global regulators fused with various fluorescent proteins and subsequent fluorescence microscopy affording the detection and imaging of single regulator molecules in live bacterial cells. Experiments are complemented by modeling and characterization of deterministic and stochastic mathematical descriptions of the molecular control systems, specifically addressing challenging issues of biological complexity such as oscillatory behavior due to time delays in regulatory circuits and spatial considerations of one-, two- and three-dimensional diffusion search modes of molecular regulators.
Engineering genetic circuits and molecular pathways is the most demanding for the descriptions in molecular biology. The team has shown considerable ability in designing and implementing their original idea. Making accessible fuels such as ethanol and buthanol from sunlight is an inspiring notion that deserves the attention of scientist and engineers worldwide. The team has therefore broken important new ground for others to follow in the future. Coaching the team has been a very rewarding experience.

About Us:
      This is the first time that UC Davis has decided to enter the iGEM competition. This team is comprised of six undergraduate students from three different academic fields of interest: College of Engineering, College of Agricultural and Environmental Sciences, and College of Biological Science. This project has been supervised by Dr. Marc Facciotti . While UC Davis is new to the iGEM competition, two of the members on the UC Davis team have competed in iGEM before.
