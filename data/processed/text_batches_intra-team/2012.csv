Many of our basic parts (promoters, terminators, RBSs, and fluorescent proteins) are courtesy of the Dueber lab.
The iGEM team chose the targeting proteins/sequences from the literature and either PCRed them from genomic DNA or synthesized them, built all of the composite parts, and assayed them.
The leucine zipper sequences were courtesy of Amy Keating's lab, in a collaborative effort to identify an orthogonal interaction set. The iGEM team constructed the MiCoded leucine zippers and assayed them.
The Golden Gate assembly of our multigene and MiCode cassettes was designed and performed by the iGEM team.
On the software side, the iGEM team wrote the MATLAB code, constructed the Cell Profiler pipeline for automated image analysis, and tested it using images generated by the iGEM team.

Wetlab
Many of our basic parts (promoters, terminators, and fluorescent proteins) are courtesy of the Dueber Lab at UC Berkeley, our host this year. Our iGEM team chose the targeting proteins and sequences from the the Yeast GFP Database created by the O'Shea and Weissman Labs at UCSF, and either PCRed them from genomic DNA or synthesized them via gene synthesis ourselves. We then combined these parts with the basic parts provided by the Dueber Lab to build all the devices we utilized.
All the higher-order (cassette, multigene, full MiCode) device cloning, which mainly involved Golden Gate Assembly, was done by our iGEM team. While some of the Golden Gate backbones were provided by the Dueber Lab, many of the parts specific to MiCode project, specifically the backbones for multigene and full MiCode assembly, were designed and cloned by us. Additionally, we produced all the yeast strains necessary throughout our entire iGEM project and did all the image acquisition and analysis.
The leucine zipper sequences were provided courtesy of the Keating Lab at MIT, in a collaborative effort to identify an orthogonal interaction set. With the sequences provided, we constructed the leucine zippers via gene synthesis, combined them into our MiCode construction scheme, and assayed them in yeast.
Computational
On the software side, we wrote the MATLAB code, constructed the Cell Profiler pipeline for automated image analysis, and tested it using images generated by our iGEM team. Matlab object identification functions from the community forum were used as templates for the basis of our own code. We developed CellProfiler pipelines with the aid of the CellProfiler manual and sample pipelines from the online forum .
Website, Presentation, and Poster
With their permission, we began with the website template of the Berkeley 2011 iGEM team , and tweaked it to our needs this year. All the content was created by us except for the blue banner and Berkeley logo (provided by the University ), and the Javascript necessary for our slideshow on the front page (provided by Dev7 Studios ).
For the presentation and poster, any images not of our creation are cited where relevant.

Robert ""Sleepless"" Chen is a 3rd year Bioengineering student. He enjoys running, cooking, creating cool science lessons, and finding good places to nap on campus. He is an officer of Berkeley Engineers and Mentors, a science outreach organization, where he gets to teach those lessons. Robert worked on cloning the strains for promoter optimization, designing and constructing the MiCode cloning scheme, and characterizing registry yeast promoter strengths.
Celia ""Klepto"" Cheung is a 2nd year Bioengineering student. When she is not studying organic chemistry, she can be found playing violin during Berkeley Symphony Orchestra rehearsal, stealing the P2 pipette from Robert's bench, or drawing dry erase masterpieces on our whiteboards. Celia worked on the wetlab portion of the project, helping with promoter optimization and MiCode creation. She also worked on image acquisition and kick-started work on our wiki in the middle of the summer.
Thomas ""T-Dawg"" Chow is a 3rd year Bioengineering student looking towards a future in bioinformatics. He is the Treasurer of the Bioengineering Honor Society, which he has been a member of for two years. Thomas began by creating the actin-localization protein we used, but was primarily involved in the computational side of the project. He wrote Cell Profiler pipelines to recognize the nucleus and run the library check. As a result, he has grown to love the nucleus in an affair of which actin would disapprove.
Austin ""Reezy!"" Jones is a 4th year Molecular Cell Biology and Environmental Science student. In his free time, he enjoys swimming, hiking, traveling, doing Berkeley Model UN, eating strangely-colored chip dips, and contemplating mung beans. Austin worked on the wetlab side of the project, developing the plasma membrane signal sequence and constructing then testing the initial batch of leucine zippers. And most importantly, he cloned the parts we sent to the almighty registry.
Harneet ""Call Me Maybe"" Rishi is a 4th year Chemical Engineering student who loves basketball and watching multiple TV shows simultaneously. Harneet was involved in the computational side of the project, where he wrote our Matlab scripts for cell separation. He was also tasked with kicking off our presentation and setting the stage for the rest to follow, losing many nights of sleep over the problem.
Masaki ""Illustrator"" Yamada is a 4th year Chemical Engineering student. In addition to his studies, he has competed on Berkeley's fencing team for three years, enjoys watching sunsets, and is prone to losing his belongings (wallet in particular).  Masaki worked on fluorescence localization, creating the nuclear targeting tag, and on MiCode construction later in the project. With his Illustrator beastliness, he created many diagrams for our wiki, poster, and presentation.
Vincent ""Baller"" Yeh is a 4th year Chemical Engineering student who loves basketball. In his free time, he enjoys playing ""Call Me Maybe"" on Harneet's laptop, playing Justin Bieber on his own, and poking fun at Lochte during the Olympics. Vincent created the vacuolar membrane targeting protein and worked on the leucine zipper assay, producing the yeast strains that give us many of the pretty pictures in our wiki and presentation.
Will is a fourth-year graduate student in the Dueber Lab and an ultimate frisbee champion, helping to carry the Dueber Lab team in the annual lab tournament. He has helped the iGEM team tremendously this past summer as an advisor, and has put up with us bothering him with questions every five minutes. Will is the person that Terry and John have stuck with all of the heavy lifting. In fairness, he's younger and can plausibly survive it.
Terry has a master's degree in chemical engineering from MIT and is currently teaching bioengineering at UC Berkeley. He hopes that by doing so, he will be giving students the tools that they will need to repair him when he gets older.
An Assistant Professor in the Department of Bioengineering at UC Berkeley and a principle investigator of the Energy Biosciences Institute, John is our fearless leader.

He is a postdoc at the University of Minnesota's Biotechnology Institute and plans to do something with his life someday. David is obsessed with good food, Canadian whiskey, and political news. He is passionate about skiing, traveling, and ranting about republicans. David gets his caffeine from numerous cups of coffee throughout the day. He avoids the sun preferring to hang in the shade, but will use ample sunscreen when venturing out.  His TV alter ego: Brian Griffin from Family Guy.
Sarah Bloch Sarah is a PhD student in Biochemistry, Molecular Biology and Biophysics who hopes to use her synthetic biology experience to land a career in industry.  She loves to spend her time cooking, reading or playing with her puppy Buster.  She prefers cold caffeinated beverages - an iced coffee in the morning and diet soda with lunch.  Being a grad student, she spends most of her time indoors slaving away at the lab bench... but when the occasion arises, she uses sunscreen or well-covering clothing to block UV rays.  Her TV character alter ego: Liz Lemon from 30 Rock.
Mark Held Mark received his PhD in plant genetics from the University of Western Ontario, in Canada and is currently working as a postdoctoral research associate at the University of Minnesota.  If he’s not in the lab, he enjoys cooking, gardening, fly-fishing and of course playing hockey during the winter as any good Canuck would.  Mark’s tanning regime generally involves developing a really bad farmer’s tan early in the summer, which gets progressively worse throughout the year.  His TV alter ego: Randy Marsh from South Park.
Dana Morrone Dana holds a PhD in biochemistry and his future goals are in the fields of agricultural biotechnology and science policy. His interests include reading, traveling, building furniture and global domination through enzyme kinetics. He does not drink caffeinated drinks, this is not due to religious reasons, but because he would be awake all night. He doesn't really use sunscreen because he's not a fan of the beach and usually ends up swimming only at night if he's had any caffeine. Charlie Townsend is his TV alter-ego.
Grayson Wawrzyn Grayson is a PhD candidate in the Schmidt-Dannert lab.  He s entering the final year of study before completion of his thesis work.  After graduation he plans to looks for positions in industry or a postdoctoral research position in a lab specializing in synthetic biology and metabolic engineering.  His interests include video games, music, soccer, running, and spending time with his golden retriever, Allie.  Grayson's dose of caffeine comes in the form of a single cup of strong coffee first thing in the morning, and the occasional diet coke with lunch.  He uses sunscreen less frequently than he should, often burning and applying copious amounts of aloe to prevent peeling.  His TV character alter ego:  Ted Mosby from How I Met Your Mother.

XMU-Acknowledgement
Acknowledgement
All work described on this wiki or on our parts registry pages was done by iGEM Team XMU-China 2012. We managed the whole project, from planning to financing the complete lab work by ourselves. Nevertheless we could not have done all this work without the help, advice and guidance of several people. Therefore, special thanks to the following people:
Our advisor Graduate Xuesong Zheng for helping us in fluorescence test and immobilization.
Prof. Xiaodong Chen for providing us many instruments such as ELISA reader to test the fluorescence and his students Song Huang, Renpan Deng, Xiang You for experimental guidance.
Prof. Yinghua Lu and his student Shiduo Zhang for helping us make the PDMDAAC-NaCS microcapsules.
Dr. Ying Zeng, Kunming Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences, who has provided us with valuable guidance in constructing gene circuits.

Our Team
Team Description:
Our core team is made of 3 instructors, 3 advisors and 15 undergraduate students across a wide range of academic backgrounds. As time goes on, we quickly learned each other's strengths and weaknesses and developed standard systems of organizational management in order to synchronize our efforts for the many parallel tasks at hand. We learned protocols, shared them with one another, worked together, and finally completed the project. Due to our different major background, which allowed us to simultaneously approach problems from many angles. We are proud of our project we have created and we hope it can leave you a deep impression.

IDEA
The idea of Crustaway has been always in the back of our minds since Daniele proposed it in our first meeting in March.
However, the idea started to take off when Jason found an interesting paper by J. Keasling where they used two genes to reduce sulfate with the ultimate goal of precipitating metals. Since then everybody worked on the planning of the project.
Anna and Giacomo with some help from Sheref (one of our supervisors) designed the Terminator 5 project.
CONSTRUCT DESIGN
Crust Away
Most of the constructs were planned by Giacomo and Daniele, with some help from Cristina (our supervisor).
The constructs for the GFP fusion were designed by Jason, Andrea and Francesco.
Terminator 5
We started to build our platform from a plasmid of the Mansy lab (RL024), made by one of our advisors Roberta Lentini (one of our advisors). Starting from this construct we mutated three illegal sites and we added a prefix and a suffix between the two fluorescent proteins.
All the constructs for this project were designed by Giacomo and Anna, with initial help of Cristina.
CLONING & CHARACTERIZATION
CysDes Parts:
Andrea built and characterized Parts: K731300, K731400, K731450 (i.e. K731400 in pSB4K5), K731480.
The initial gene encoding CysDes was synthetized by Genescript and then subcloned into our Parts.
Gas chromatography measurements were done by Damiano Avi.
CysE Parts:
Jason has cloned and characterized Parts: K731000, K731010, K731020, K731030, K731025 (i.e. K731020 in pSB3C5), K731035 (i.e. K731030 in pSB3C5), K731040, K731045 (i.e. K731040 in pSB3C5).

Our Supervisors and Advisors
Supervisors
Cristina
Given her educational and research training Cristina Del Bianco is not sure anymore if she is a chemist, a structural biologist, or a biochemist, which probably means that she's a perfect synthetic biology fit! She likes hiking, baking American-style cakes (e.g. Martha Stewart pies!!!), anything that has to do with crafting, knitting, and sewing and of course iGEM!
Sheref
Sheref Mansy has been at the University of Trento for the past three years. He grew up in the great state of Ohio. He enjoys the lovely Trentino mountains, Korean food, and building in vitro cellular mimics. More information on his work can be found at smansy.org .
Olivier
Olivier Jousson is directore of Scienze e Tecnologie Biomolecolari program at the University of Trento. He currently works on virulence factors of pathogenic bacteria, but his early research and best rememberings had to do with molecular ecology of fish parasites, in particular tremendous diving experiences in protected areas from the Mediterrean Sea. He is not interested exclusively on the microbial world: he also likes Sicilian food and playng the guitar.
Advisors
Roberta
Roberta Lentini gave up her personal life to join the PhD programme in the Armenise-Harvard Laboratory of Synthetic and Reconstructive Biology at the University of Trento. She likes running, even if coordination is not her best friend. She has a passion for fluorescent proteins, and everything that has a shadow of fucsia. If you want to find her, stop by CIBIO at ANYTIME with a beer (including weekends!).
Laura
Laura Martini is a PhD student in the Armenise-Harvard Laboratory of Synthetic and Reconstructive Biology at the University of Trento. She graduated in Modena and now in Trento she misses a lot tortellini. She loves Science and Sherlock Holmes at the same level. Sometimes she is a little bit obsessed by contamination, her motto is ""think steril, be steril!"".

iGEM Trento 2012
Selection was made using Ampicillin
We are six students attending the bachelor course in Biomolecular Sciences and Technologies at University of Trento.        Although it could seem a small team composed of students of the same background, our interests space widely from literature and music, web-design, climbing and parties.
We were not alone in this amazing experience, though. We were sustained by a rich group of people who helped us in very different situations.
Jason
Jason Fontana is a Scienze e Tecnologie Biomolecolari student in Trento. He is a blogger, self-made web designer and a sort of IT consultant.           He writes and mostly links about technology at jasonfweb.com , writes in 140 characters at Twitter ( @jasonfweb ) and is on Facebook too.
Guzz
Francesco Guzzonato is a Scienze e Tecnologie Biomolecolari student in Trento. He is a wannabe writer, with little effort and decent achievements - top 25 in Campiello Giovani 2009. Probably you could read his works somewhere online, but he doesn't remember where he posted them. You can find him on Facebook or email him .
Ross
Daniele Rossetto is a Scienze e Tecnologie Biomolecolari student in Trento. He is a science enthusiast and an incurable optimist. He loves letting his mind flow and talking about the craziest things and situations, you better stop listen and run when you hear the words ""and what about..."" or be involved in some odd idea! Daniele is eager to know new people so contact him on Facebook or by email .
Andrea
Andrea Tassinari is a Scienze e Tecnologie Biomolecolari student in Trento. Sometimes she is a chess player, sometimes sort of A bass player. She loves warm places: sooner or later you will find her on a lonely island, sole with the sound of her Musicman. God save the funk. We also take care of statues, of course.
Giaco
Giacomo Giacomelli is a Scienze e Tecnologie Biomolecolari student in Trento. He really likes talking with everyone about things that are important to him and he is often so much involved into the talking to appear a bit rude.
If you want to argue about something or just to contact him you can find him on Facebook or by email . Come at me Bro.
Anna
Anna Depetris is a Scienze e Tecnologie Biomolecolari student in Trento. She likes music and nature, but she studies too much. She likes arguing too, and probably she is shouting with Giaco now.      You can contact her by email , at your risk.

The team came up with ideas for projects and after discussions which involved all students as well as all advisors and instructors, it was decided to develop two projects. So, the team had to find a way to obtein money to subscribe in competition. For this purpose, the instructor Carlos Hotta and the student Otto Heringer had an insight of doing a video and posting it on a crowdfunding site on internet, RocketHub. It turned out to be a great idea, since the team successfully achieved the inscription fee.
The Plug&Play project was executed by the undergraduate students Cauã Westmann, Joana Guiro and Macarena Lopez. The students were supervised and helped by the instructor Edgar Andrés Ochoa C. (at that time he was a PhD student). He created the project, helped them in the development of the experiments and gave them theoretical support. The experiments were developed in the GaTE Lab at Bioscience Institute-USP headed by Full Professor Dr. Van Sluys, where the team received support and laboratory materials.
The Associative Memory Network was executed by the undergraduate students: Cleandho Marcos, Daniel Ariano, Fernando Lindenberg, Liliam Oliveira, Lucas Cespedes, Otto Heringer and Pedro Medeiros; and the masters students Débora Parrine and Luíza Barros. Three laboratories gave support to this project: instructor Professor Carlos Hotta’s Lab at Chemistry Institute -USP, instructor Professor Cleslei Fernando Zanelli’s Lab and advisor Professor José Gregório’s Lab at Institute of Biomedical Sciences-USP. Those instructors and advisors not only gave support by allowing us to use their labs but also on theoretical support to solve problems on experiments.
The two mathematical models were developed by the postgraduated student Marcelo Boareto and the undergraduate student Francisco Camargo and was supervised by the advisor Professor Nestor Caticha. The postgraduated students André Schraider Maizel and Jonatas Eduardo Cesar as well as the students Daniel Ariano and Otto Heringer have helped with sugestions.
Wiki texts were checked by the instructor Edgar Andrés Ochoa and all students were responsible for updating it. Wiki’s layout was designed by the student Otto Heringer.

Acknowledgements
Since the birth of the idea about creating an iGEM team (two years ago), this project was helped by many people. We wish to use this page to thank everyone who made this obstinate student initiative possible.
Prof. Nestor Caticha
His inspiring hungry to new subjects to learn without academic barriers was the driven force behind his important contribuition to the group. A little brainstorming is a valuable resource if it is done with Nestor. Thanks to his provocative insight, we were able to propose the design of a bacterial system who can have an associative memory.
Prof. Luiziana Silva and Prof Gregorio Gomez
This dinamic duo was very important to advising about organizational, scientific and political issues about the projects and the initiative itself. With their help, we were able to organize the Synthetic Biology Club, what lead us to develop our insights and ideas for projects.
Prof. Gláucia Mendes Souza
Her support was vital to the practical development of the project. Offering her lab and resources to our project was another key element that makes all this possible. We have no words to thanks.
Dr. Mateus Lopes Schreiner
Every history have a beginning and character who begins to plot. With an inspiring and enthusiastic feeling, Dr. Mateus ignited the fire that became an persistent student effort to create am iGEM team and learn more about synthetic biology. His encouraging support was fundamental to the existence of the group today.
Prof. Telma Zorn
We would not ever be able to travel to the jamborees without the help of prof. Telma. Her advices were greatly important not only for the iGEM initiative at USP, but even for ourselves in knowing very better how the university can support us.
Graduation Comittees
We wish to thank a lot all the support that was given in to us by all professors from all institutes that contributed to our travels through the undergraduation internationalization program. Again, no words to thanks!
Crowdfunding
Sometimes incredible things happen. And I can assure you: a great part of these things happen because the help of the many, with the help of the crowd! Without them we would never have the initial capital to invest in the project and also the media impact about the initiative. Again, for every one of the 39 persons who helped our subscription: thank you very very much!
Unicamp-EMSE 2011 iGEM team
The outstanding support from the ones who already experienced an iGEM isn't mensurable. They helped us with valorous advices and provided the BioBricks of 2011 to us, an important resource before the 2012 distribuition. We wish to thanks particulary Mariana Favaro, Nemailla Bonturi, Gleidson Teixeira and prof. Renato Vicentini.
We also wish to thank all other persons who helped directly or indirecly in all our achievements this year, but where not mentioned here. Thank you!

We all are enrolled in the molecular biomedicine programme (Molekulare Biomedizin) at the University of Bonn.
What we did
Our team was formed in October 2011 as the first team from the University of Bonn.
In May 2012 we began to work in the lab. Also take a look at our website at the University of Bonn
Where we're from
The city of Bonn is nestled in the mouth of the middle rhine gorge in the heart of western Germany, a pictoresque valley of vineyards and mountain-top castles. Looking back at a 2000-year history dating back to roman ages, Bonn served as capital of the Federal Republic of Germany from 1949 to 1998 and has since redefined itself as a cosmopolitan city of science, continuing a tradition founded by Friedrich August Kekule, the discoverer of aromatic structure, Heinrich Hertz, the reknown physicist, Otto Wallach and Ludwig Claisen, both synthetic organic chemists and many more.
Today, Bonn boasts a leading research university, the Max-Planck-associated CAESAR institute and the Fraunhofer Institutes in Birchlinghoven. The university itself has very active life science research departments, including the biology, pharmacy and chemistry departments, the medical school, and the LIMES institute, which hosts our iGEM team through its Medicinal Chemistry and Chemical Biology Program Unit.
A common scientific focus of the LIMES Institute is the study of metabolism and immunity and their cross-regulation in health and disease. The LIMES research groups provide major research expertise in Chemical Biology, Medicinal Chemistry, Development, Genetics, Cell and Immune Biology, Membrane Biology and Lipid Biochemistry. They co-operate in a number of interdisciplinary research initiatives funded by the German Research Foundation DFG (Collaborative Research Centers SFBs 645, 704).

During the competition, the iGEM Team Bonn 2012 raised money, purchased lab equipment, planned and did all the lab work, organized public outreach events, spoke to the media, planned their jamboree trip and worked on their Wiki and documentation.
Many people helped us during the project. Without this help, our project would have never been possible. People who gave us advice, instructions, new ideas or helped us out with new materials and stuff.
In biweekly meetings with our instructors and advisors we talked about our achievements and discussed what we needed to do next.  So lots of credit goes to Prof. Dr. Günter Mayer, Prof. Dr. Michael Famulok, Katia Schöler, Silvana Haßel, Anna Hall, Martina Bettio and many other people in the lab for their patience and help!
We also want to thank our sponsors , without them the project would not even have started. Thank you for supporting our work!
Sequencing
Gene sequencing was paid by the labs of our instructors. Thank you for the support!
Support for SynBio Info Day
A special thanks to all the companies that supported us with materials for the tombola at our SynBio Info Day: Helios Klinikum Wuppertal GmbH, Volksbank Bonn Rhein-Sieg eG, Westdeutscher Rundfunk Köln, Deutsches Rotes Kreuz Kreisverband Bonn e.V., Carl Roth GmbH & Co. KG and Macherey-Nagel GmbH & Co. KG. We also thank LMU-Munich who provided the press release for all German iGEM teams.
LOV Samples
To track down our LOVTAP issues, we requested LOV samples from other iGEM teams and LMU-Munich and TU Darmstadt were so kind to provide us with the requested plasmids. Many thanks for doing this from the whole team! We also thank the Sosnick Lab at the University of Chicago for providing us with their LOVTAP fusion construct and Vincent Noireaux from the University of Minnesota for his mazF plasmid.

iGEM
The International Genetically Engineered Machine competition (iGEM) is the premiere undergraduate Synthetic Biology competition. Student teams are given a kit of biological parts at the beginning of the summer from the Registry of Standard Biological Parts. Working at their own schools over the summer, they use these parts and new parts of their own design to build biological systems and operate them in living cells. This project design and competition format is an exceptionally motivating and effective teaching method.

""How old are you in that picture?""
Zoe Ashwood
Physicist/ Mathematician aroused by the fact that linear algebra extends to biology.
Frequently engages in ceilidh dancing, sibling embarrassment and muddy walks. Less frequently: surfing, skiing and hill starts due to previous experiences.
Josi Buerger
Increase your confusion about life+make yourself unpopular with tutors by asking questions about truth-preserving #Biochemistry&Philosophy
Keeping up with uni work, a social life, sleep - you may have 2. What is this things you call sleep? #caffeine #saxophone #runningbarefoot
Antti Korpimäki
I'm a 3rd year computer scientist interested in P2P networks.⠠⠵ I live for connections and feel happiest where sciences overlap.
I speak three languages fluently, use Arch Linux and make and play videogames. Favourite anime episode: SHnY 9 [Kyon order] ""Someday In The Rain"".
Michael Lockhart
Fourth year of five Medicinal Chemist
I am interested in all aspects of science with chemistry as my main focus. I enjoy being part of iGEM as it brings disciplines together.
I enjoy rowing, cycling and playing rugby. I’m also a keen runner and I’m attempting to participate in races over the summer and next year.
Mindaugas Paužuolis
I am a first year biochemist with wide range of interests in science, especially in biochemistry and genetics. But most of all he is thrilled about terra nova of biology – synthetic biology.
Sometimes I try to combine biochemical reactions with salsa and cha cha rhythms. Motto of my life - experience something new every day.
Veronica Rezelj
4th year. Biochemistry. I am passionate about viruses and fascinated by the fact that cellular nano-scale machinery resemble machines we have engineered in a much bigger scale for use in our everyday life. I enjoy discussing ethical implications of science, spending time with friends, cooking, and traveling in my free time.
Aleksejs Sazonovs
I am a second year Computer Science student, who likes applying his skills in other scientific fields. I am especially interested in Big Data and Computer Vision. I enjoy travelling and my personal goal is to visit all the continents in the next decade. I like old movies and music.
Hannah Taylor
3rd Yr Evolutionary Biology. Into genetics, development and evolution; Forward thinking, exciting and lots of potential.
I like running, reading, rugby, hockey, swimming, eating and sleeping. I also like dogs and orange, mountains and skiing.

I’m a second year medic at St Andrews. I enjoy chemistry and biology in my first year and now the medical course. I wish that iGEM brings me more “flavour” of biology and the fun of multidisciplinary teamwork!
By the way, I love music a lot and play alto saxophone myself.
 
Academic advisors
Giants who let us stand on their shoulders
Terry Smith
Reader in the Schools of Biology and Chemistry, my research utilises a wide range of disciplines to genetically and chemically validate drug targets involved in lipid metabolism of protozoan parasites that cause neglected Third world diseases, such African sleeping sickness.
Chris Hooley
I am a Lecturer in Theoretical Condensed Matter Physics, working on what happens to many interacting quantum particles when they get cold.  ""In my spare time I'm interested in pretty much anything that can be eaten, drunk, read, listened to, looked at, talked to, or visited.
John Mitchell
Reader in the School of Chemistry, interested in anything computational and related to molecules. Interests range from bioinformatics to theoretical chemistry, such as computing protein-ligand binding, pharmaceutical solubilities, side-effects and toxicities.
Silvia Paracchini
Royal Society URF based at the School of Medicine. Neurogeneticist interested in the molecular underpinnings of neurodevelopmental disorders and human cognition.
Cant wait to see Italy (winning) in Murrayfield this year. Traveling is never too much.
Katharine Preedy
Would be climber, modeller - ecological/epidemiological, maths/stats - research and support, flautist, geek and general over-enthusiast.
 
Postgraduate advisors
Lab comrades and sources of infinite care
C David Owen
First year structural biology Ph.D.
I am interested in bacteria to bacteria communication. Once the signal synthesis and detection is understood, we can hijack the system and control their behaviour.
Don't do much else.
Michał Barski
First year PhD student in structural biology of viruses
I'm based in the protein NMR lab. The main focus of my work is deciphering the structural mechanism of innate immune response inhibition by some viruses. When not in the lab, I'm a keen mountain hiker and a film geek.

Nate Amidei
This is Nathaniel Amidei. He is the sultan of solutions, the prince of PCRs, and the tzar of timepoints.  He is fearless in the face of his major, Biochemestry, on the battlefield they call UC Davis. And most importantly, he stares down the competition until it is unanimously decided that he deserves the prize.
Verna Huang
Hi, my name is Verna Huang. I've loved science since 6th grade, and I hope to expand my interest in science through iGem. When not geeking out over synthetic biology, I like to read fiction of any kind, draw my surroundings, and swim. I intend to pursue a major in chemical engineering at University of California in Santa Barbara this fall.
Kendall Kearns
Hi there! My name is Kendall Kearns. I love food, sleep, the color blue, music, art, and hanging out with friends and family. In my free time, I enjoy watching movies, reading, olympic weightlifting or working out, and cooking! I've always loved science, probably since I started watching The Magic School Bus every morning in elementary and middle school. I'm currently attending UC Irvine, possibly majoring in Microbiology and Immunology. I might also want to minor in something else, but I'm not sure yet!
Louis Tan
My name is Louis Tan. I graduated from Abraham Lincoln High School in San Francisco, CA in 2012. Currently, I am attending UC Berkeley as a freshman. My intended major is Molecular and Cell Biology. I enjoy running in parks and places filled with nature and pretty green foliage. A major hobby of mine is art, and I recently discovered a love for figure drawing. Though I can't draw faces effectively, I am working on improving my skillz. If you ever see me in the street, feel free to ask me for a portrait, and I will show you how much I have improved. :)
Helena Viets
My name is Helena Viets. I like the color green, cats, olympic weightlifting, dragon boat, ice cream, and naps. I devote my free time to the things in the previous sentence, and devote my not-free time to going to class at UC Berkeley, pursuing a Molecular Environmental Biology major and a Chinese minor.
Yesenia Lopez
My name is Yesenia Lopez. I am a student attending City college of San Francisco majoring in Molecular and cell Biology. I had a great Biology teacher my sophomore year at Burton high school. One of the greatest impacts that made sciences so interesting to me is that, I was amazed by the complexity of nature. I couldn't believe tall living organism were composed of cells, I thought it was incredible and very unbelievable. From those years on I have been interested in research and I am glad to be part of the iGem 2012 team. Through this program I was able to see how working in a team with other students for a common goal can prove to worth wild.
Super Buddies/Second Years
Sami Chu
Hi, I'm Sami Chu. Ever since I saw E. coli glow in biotech class, I was convinced that science was the bomb. Other things that are the bomb include drawing, singing, and watching Netflix. I am a English and Biology double major at Macalester College in Saint Paul, Minnesota.
Julia Loi
Julia attends University of California, Irvine. Her hobbies consist of spending time with close friends and going out to eat good food. She loves that science is a never ending process of discovering how natural processes work.
Jingyi Xi
My name is Xi, Jingyi. I just graduated from Peking University as a Physics student. I  joined the team in UCSF this summer and continued helping with the modeling portion after going back to Beijing. You might think I is good at mathematics and programming, but I would probably tell you that I am best at cooking.

Susan Chen
Hello! My name is Susan and I am a first year at UCSF in the Tetrad program. I grew up in the east bay area and stayed around to study biochemistry and bioengineering at UC Berkeley (Go Bears!). During my time at Cal, I discovered academic research, more specifically synthetic biology, and became very interested in harvesting the power of biology for useful applications. Spurred by that interest, I joined the 2009 Berkeley iGEM team to work on bacterial surface display, and from there I became inspired to one day TA iGEM, contributing to this rich experience for students and just getting plain old excited for novel synthetic biology research.
Ben Heineike
Ben Heineike is assisting the IGEM team with computational tools.  He is a PhD student in Bioinformatics, and a member of the UCSF center for Systems and Synthetic Biology. He grew up in Kings Beach, Ca and graduated from North Tahoe High School, and afterwards attended the US Naval Academy, where he studied mathematics.  He also holds an MSc in Applied and Computational Mathematics from the University of Oxford.  He spent several years as a Surface Wafare Officer in the US Navy including a tour as a mathematics instructor at the Naval Academy.
Graham Heimberg
I'm Graham, a second year Bioinformatics PhD student here at UCSF.  After doing iGEM as an undergrad at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign... twice, I figured I wasn't quite done yet.  So now I help with the computational aspects of the team's project.  I think iGEM is a pretty cool opportunity. Here at UCSF where we have a team mainly comprised of high school students and it's particularly exciting for this to be their first exposure to hands on, technical science.
John Haliburton
Graduate Student, iPQB
Greg Fedewa
Greg is a second year Bioinformatics student at UCSF. He went to Michigan State University for undergrad and studied Biochemistry & Molecular Biology.  While there he worked in a plant biochemistry lab.  After undergrad, he worked for a few years researching plant genetics.  He also helped with the iGEM Jamboree in 2009.  This year he is helping mostly with wet lab experiments and analysis.

Poster-Presentation at Conferences
Biotechnologie 2020+ | 3. Jahreskongress
Fabian, Lara and Volker joined the other German teams at the conference organized by the Federal Ministry for Education and Research in Berlin.
Here the idea for the Germany-wide information day about synthetic biology was born.
CAS Conference – Synthetic Biology
Fabian joined the other teams at the CAS Conference in Munich to present our poster and to talk to the other iGEM teams participating in the conference.
Participation in the iGEM Germany Action Day for Synthetic Biology
We helped to organize the action day of all German iGEM teams by writing the press release for all other teams. The idea to arrange a Germany-wide action day was to address people outside the university and attract attention about iGEM and synthetic biology. Besides it was a step to have an ""open-science"". The people were very pleased to be informed about new approaches because they thought science is mainly behind closed doors. So we tried to change this view a bit, and hopefully it worked. Seven German iGEM teams participated in the action day and organized information booths and activities around synthetic biology.
If you want to read more about this day, take a look on our ""Human Practice"" page.
Teams That Joined The Action Day

Collaboration with LMU Munich iGEM Team
Action Day
Logo of LMU-Munich iGEM team
The LMU Munich iGEM team joined us on the Action Day. Our team organized the information booth, we organized the permission of the city of Munich, and we payed the fee for it. To get a booth in the city center of Munich is not that easy and costs a lot of time.  Besides we organized all the booklets and created a handout to distribute and inform the public. The LMU iGEM team organized the tables and the movable walls so that we had a booth at all.
Collaboration with Jessica Ebner from Stuttgart University
Mentioned in her Diploma thesis
Jessica Ebner is a student at the University of Stuttgart. She contacted us at a very early stage of the project and asked us whether she could describe the iGEM competition using our team as an example. Her diploma thesis is entitled: ""Engineering of Life – What is Synthetic Biology and how does it operate?"" She visited us once. We explained our project to her and she received a login to our internal wiki.  In her thesis she dedicated ten pages to the iGEM competition and our team.
Abstract
This diploma thesis aims at reflecting the cross-disciplinary field of Synthetic Biology as an emerging engineering technology. Initially this requires a concise analysis of the historical development of the term Synthetic Biology as well as the recent progresses concerning DNA synthesis and sequencing technologies. Furthermore this comprises the exemplification of the engineering based approach to Synthetic Biology. With reference to the several major categories of Synthetic Biology, this thesis theoretically analyzes the distinct areas of focus and specifies those insights with applied-oriented examples. In addition, this work describes the basic principles of the unique International Genetically Engineered Machines (iGEM) competition and focuses on the importance of an innovative contribution made by the iGEM team of undergraduate students from the Technical University of Munich. Eventually this thesis conducts a critical evaluation of both, the internal strengths and weaknesses of Synthetic Biology and the chances and risks which the synthetic biology community will likely to be faced with.
Part from her thesis
A part for her thesis about synthetic biology and its opportunities can be downloaded - however, it is only in German. Besides she made her final presentation in English available.
Providing our ""Original Bavarian Collaboration Medal""
For the response of our survey on standardization of BioBrick part descriptions we provided all the participants with a small badge (shown on the left) for the collaboratin page of their wiki to show that they contributed with their opinion to our attempt to improve the usability of BioBricks in the future.
Additionally we will raffle a typical Bavarian present among all teams completing our survey.
Number of participants: 116
Number of different teams: 55

Contribution to ""iGEM Memes"" on Facebook
During spare time in the lab, the creative minds of our team submitted two pictures to the facebook page created by the team from Stanford-Brown
TUM Young Academy
Fig. 1: Logo of the TUM young academy
One group of the TUM young academy provided us their survey data, They are working on a webpage which is to provide information about genetic engineering and the regulations.
The TUM young academy supports student for five years with interdisciplinary  projects. They want to support highly dedicated and outstanding students to achieve their goals.

Utah State iGEM team has collaborated with several teams this year and have provided parts and advice. We collaborated with the UC Chile Team by providing them with a cyanobacterial transformation vector ( BBa_K390000 ) we designed during iGEM 2010, as well as providing them with details and procedures for its use and customization. We collaborated with the Copenhagen Team by providing them with a cyanobacteria promoter ( BBa_K390008 ) that is active in the dark that we designed during iGEM 2010, as well as providing them with information from our literature review about the part.
High School Outreach
Engineering State Event
Our iGEM team had the amazing opportunity to reach out to high school students through a program at Utah State University called Engineering State. This event allowed us to positively impact high school students from 43 different school districts in which 4 charter schools were represented.
We had four teaching sessions with an average of 23 high school students per session. Our team focused specifically in the area of synthetic biology and biotechnology, teaching them current research being done in this area as well as techniques used.  The topics included bacterial transformation, fluorescent proteins, fluorescence microscopy and the iGEM competition. They showed particular interest in the projects held by our Utah State iGEM team and were informed that they could join as high school students if they wished to participate. We also offered the students a hands on experience to give them an in-depth view of the strategies that we use in our own lab.
The exercise consisted in transforming green fluorescent protein (GFP) into competent E. coli cells. The students added GFP DNA cells to the competent cells and allowed them to incubate for a few minutes. The mixture of cells were then placed in a 42 degree Celsius water bath to “heat shock” the cells, allowing DNA to enter the E. coli cells. Then LB growth medium was added and the cells were incubated for some time to be then transferred to Ampicillin-containing agar plates. The students had fun by “drawing” with the solution on the agar plates while they learned the process behind it. These plates were incubated overnight and pictures of their plates under UV light were emailed to these students.
Discover Biological Engineering Event
Members of the 2012 iGEM also team presented to high school students visiting Utah State University for the department's Discover Biological Engineering program.  The presentation included what synthetic biology is, what the iGEM competition is, how Utah State has participated in the past, and explained this year’s project.  Interactions included answering questions and helping high school students learn how to get involved in iGEM.

Prof. Heinz Neumann greatly supported us with working out our project, all kinds of scientific advice for lab work or texts, or when we were desperate to find a lab space and already saw everything falling apart. We are very grateful for all of his support!!!
On this page, we would additionally like to thank people who are not actually members of our team, but kindly assisted us during different phases of our project.
All other laboratory work, Wiki content, and BioBrick annotation was provided by the student members of our team.
People we want to thank!
Dr. Michael Hoppert
Dr. Hoppert is a work group leader in the department of General and Applied Microbiology. He supported our team  by examining our E. coli strains with the electron microscope. He also offered to lend us a helping hand for making some fluorescence microscopy images to visualize our enhanced strains in case we succeed in Amsterdam! Due to these pictures we would be able to investigate whether our alterations indeed cause the expected effects. Even though we did not achieve the results we hoped in electron microscopy some of us still were able to learn more about this interesting technique and observe an expert on this field doing his job. Now one of his pictures of the strain MG1655 decorates our header and all of us are very thankful for his help!

Prof. Heinz Neumann unterstützte uns großartig bei der Projektauswahl, mit wissenschaftlichem Rat zu Laborarbeit und Texten, und als wir händeringend einen Laborplatz suchten und schon alles scheitern sahen. Wir sind überaus dankbar für seine Unterstützung!!!
Auf dieser Seite wollen wir außerdem Menschen danken, die zwar nicht zu unserem Team gehören, uns aber trotzdem netterweise in verschiedenen Aspekten unseres Projekts unterstützt haben.
Sämtliche andere Laborarbeiten, Wiki-Inhalte oder BioBrick-Annotationen wurden von den Studenten unseres Teams beigesteuert.
Menschen, denen wir danken wollen!
Dr. Michael Hoppert
Dr. Hoppert leitet eine der Arbeitsgruppen der Allgemeinen und Angewandten Mikrobiologie. Er unterstütze unser Team durch die Untersuchung unserer E. coli Stämme unter dem Elektronenmikroskop. Zudem bot er uns seine Hilfe bei der Aufnahme von Fluoreszenzmikroskopie-Bildern an. Aus zeitlichen Gründen können diese jedoch nur angefertigt werden, wenn wir zum internationalen Entscheid in Boston zugelassen werden. Mithilfe dieser Bilder könnten wir unsere verbesserten Stämme visualisieren und so herausfinden, ob unsere Veränderungen tatsächlichen die erwarteten Effekte haben.  Auch wenn wir bisher nicht die erhofften Ergebnisse erzielen konnten, ermöglichte die Kooperation mit Dr. Hoppert einigen Team-Mitgliedern mehr über Elektronmikroskopie zu lernen und einen Experten bei der Ausführung seiner Arbeit zuschauen zu können. Wir allen sind ihm für seine Hilfe sehr dankbar!
Klicken Sie hier , um auf die Homepage von Dr. Hopperts Arbeitsgruppe weitergeleitet zu werden!

Hi ihr Lieben! Mein Name ist Alicia und ich habe letztes Jahr meinen Bachelor of Science Biologie and der Universität Bonn abgeschlossen. Ich habe mich dort auf Mikrobiologie und Biotechnologie spezialisiert. Momentan studiere ich im Masterstudiengang Mikrobiologie und Biochemie and der Universität Göttingen. Die diesjährige Teilnahme an iGEM ist meine erste und ich freue mich sehr darauf, an unserem Projekt arbeiten zu können. Dies gibt uns die Möglichkeit die Laborarbeit unabhängig und eigenverantwortlich zu gestalten und ich hoffe, viel über das Arbeiten in einem wissenschaftlichen Labor zu lernen. Ich freue mich außerdem sehr auf die Teilnahme an den internationalen Wettbewerben und werde dort hoffentlich wertvolle Erfahrungen sammeln, die meinen Horizont erweitern.
Arbeitsgruppe: #3 - Chemorezeptoren
Zusätzliche Arbeitsbereiche: Organisations-Team, Human Practice
Anna Maria Köhler
Hallo ich heiße Anna und studiere wie die anderen Teammitglieder ""Microbiology and Biochemistry"" in Göttingen. Hier eine kleine Geschichte wie ich zur Biologie kam: In meiner Schulzeit hatten wir ein Genetikpraktikum mit einem Professor von einer Universität. Durch diese Laborarbeit habe ich mich damals entschlossen Biologie zu studieren um Wissenschaftlerin zu werden! Ich habe dann meine Bachelorarbeit in der Abteilung für molekulare Strukturbiologie in Göttingen absolviert, wodurch sich mein Interesse an Proteinen verstärkte. Teil des diesjährigen iGEM Teams Göttingen zu sein, bedeutet mir sehr viel, denn ich freue mich darauf eigenständig zu arbeiten und neue Ideen im Team zu entwickeln und umzusetzen.
Arbeitsgruppe: #3 - Chemorezeptoren
Zusätzliche Arbeitsbereiche: Human Practice, Grafik Design
Berit Haßing
Mein Name ist Berit Haßing und ich bin ein Mitglied des iGEM Teams der Georg-August Universität Göttingen. Ebenso wie fast alle anderen Teammitglieder bin ich zurzeit im zweiten Semester des englischsprachigen Masterstudiengangs ""Microbiology and Biochemistry""  und ich genieße meine Zeit hier in Göttingen! Letztes Jahr habe ich meinen Bachelorabschluss in der Abteilung Mikrobiologie der Universität Osnabrück erhalten und plane mich auch weiter in die Richtung Mikrobiologie und Genetik zu spezialisieren. Ich habe mich entschieden an dem iGEM Wettbewerb teilzunehmen da ich hier die Möglichkeit habe, zusammen mit anderen Studenten ein komplettes Projekt selber zu planen und durchzuführen.  Natürlich hoffe ich auch viel zu lernen und interessante neue Leute auf den internationalen Ausscheidungen zu treffen! Ich bin ein Mitglied der Gruppe 1 ""Selektion/Schwimmen"" und auch an den ""Human Practice"" Projekten beteiligt.
Arbeitsgruppe: #1 - Selektion / (bakterielles) Schwimmen
Zusätzliche Arbeitsbereiche: Human Practice, Homepage Inhalte
Bianca Genenncher
Hallo Besucher. Ich heiße Bianca Genenncher und bin in meinem Abschlussjahr des Masterstudienganges ""Biochemie und Mikrobiologie"" der Göttinger Universität. Während meines Bachelor Studiums, ebenso in Göttingen, fokusierte ich mich auf die Molekularbiologie der Pflanze im Bereich der Pflanzen-Pathogen-Interaktion, bei der die Untersuchung der pflanzlichen molekularen Reaktionen auf invasierende Pathogene einen Hauptaspekt darstellte.
Letztes Jahr habe ich dann ein Auslandssemester an der Universität Aberdeen in Schottland absolviert. Ich habe diese Zeit mit anderen Studenten aus den verschiedensten Ländern mit interessanten, kulturellen Hintergründen unglaublich genossen, aber darüber hinaus natürlich auch die Schönheit der Natur bewundert. Dies ist mein erste iGEM-Teilnahme und ich bin froh ein Teil des ersten iGEM-Teams der Universität Göttingens zu sein. Ich bin hoch motiviert, die Experimente zu starten und die ersten Erfahrungen zu sammeln, eigene Experimente zu gestalten. Ein weiterer Grund für mich daran teilzunehmen, ist die Internationalität des Wettbewerbs. Ich freue mich auf bereichernde Diskussionen mit meinen Team-Mitgliedern über die Ergebnisse oder die verschiedenen Möglichkeiten das Ziel zu erreichen.

Corinna Krüger
Hi, mein Name ist Corinna Krüger und ich studiere momentan im Masterstudiengang Mikrobiologie und Biochemie an der Universität Göttingen. Meinen Bachelorabschluss habe ich bereits an der Universität Göttingen 2011 in dem Feld Molekular Biologie absolviert. Nach meinem Studium habe ich für eine paar Monate in einem Labor an der Universität Göteborg gearbeitet. Bei iGEM bin ich zum ersten Mal dabei und ich bin sehr froh, ein Mitglied dieses Teams zu sein. Wir sind alle sehr motiviert und bereit viel für das Projekt zu tun. Ich erhoffe mir von iGEM, dass ich lerne selbstständiger zu arbeiten. Ich freue mich auch schon sehr auf den Wettbewerb in Amsterdam. Ich erhoffe mir dort viele andere Teams kennenzulernen und Erfahrungen auszutauschen.

Jan Erik Schliep
Genau wie alle andern hier bin ich Student des Master of Science Studiengangs Microbiology and Biochemistry an der Universität Göttingen. Meinen Bachelor in molekularer Biotechnologie habe ich nach sechs Semestern im August 2011 an der TU München gemacht. Als ich noch in München studiert habe, hörte ich das erste Mal von iGEM. Einige meiner ehemaligen Kommilitonen waren Teil des damaligen TUM Teams und konnten mit spannenden Geschichten aufwarten. Daraufhin war auch bei mir der Wunsch geboren, einmal bei iGEM mitzumachen. Meine Bachelor Thesis habe ich am Lehrstuhl für Proteomik und Bioanalytik von Prof. Küster (Fakultät für Ernährung, Landnutzung und Umwelt) geschrieben, welche mit viel eigenständiger Arbeit verbunden war. Das alles hat mir sehr viel Spaß gemacht, und das Gleiche wünsche ich mir für unser iGEM Projekt!

Jan Kampf
Hallo allerseits, mein Name ist Jan Kampf und ich bin Student des MSc / PhD-Programms ""Mikrobiologie und Biochemie"" an der Georg-August Universität Göttingen. Ich habe meine Bachelor of Science auf dem Gebiet der Molekularbiologie im Jahr 2011 auch an der Fakultät für Biologie der Universität Göttingen gemacht. Für meine Bachelorarbeit ""Insights into Mammalian SIRT6 Function in Cellular Stress Response"" arbeitete ich am Max-Planck-Institut für biophysikalische Chemie. Während meiner Zeit als Bachelor-Student am Max-Planck-Institut hatte ich die Gelegenheit, in einem Umfeld mit Menschen aus unterschiedlichen Ländern mit verschiedenen sowie vielfältigen Kulturen zu arbeiten. Es war eine tolle Zeit für mich und motivierte mich wieder an einem Projekt zu arbeiten, welches persönliche Herausforderung und Planung mit sich bringt. Also, ich freue mich schon sehr auf unser iGEM Projekt und die Gelegenheit, selbstständig zu arbeiten in einem Team junger Studenten sowie die Möglichkeit, unsere Arbeit und die Ergebnisse vor einem multikulturellen Publikum zu präsentieren und auf einen  Austausch von Erfahrungen während der Zeit des iGEM Projekts mit den anderen Teams.

Hallo, mein Name ist Leo und ich bin ebenfalls Student des MSc / PhD-Programms „Mikrobiologie und Biochemie“ an der Georg-August Universität Göttingen. Ich habe mich für diesen Studiengang entschieden, da mir die Kombination und Auswahl der Themenschwerpunkte besonders gefallen hat. Meinen Bachelorabschluss habe ich 2011 mit einem Schwerpunkt in angewandter und mikrobieller Mikrobiologie an der Universität Göttingen erworben. Ich denke die Teilnahme an dem IGEM Wettbewerb hilft mir dabei meine Laborerfahrung zu erweitern um mich somit bestmöglich auf meine folgende wissenschaftliche Karriere vorzubereiten. Das größte Ziel ist natürlich, dass unser Projekt erfolgreich wird und wir somit an den regionalen und internationalen Jamborees teilnehmen können.

Nikolas Rakebrandt
Hallo, mein Name ist Nikolas Rakebrandt und ich studiere momentan im zweiten Semester des MSc “Microbiology and Biochemistry” in Göttingen. Vor meiner Karriere als Wissenschaftler habe ich einen kleinen Umweg gemacht und mir dabei einen BSc in Wirtschaftswissenschaften abgeholt. Danach habe ich im Biologie Bachelor an der Uni Göttingen studiert und meine Abschlussarbeit über Effektor-Proteine von pflanzenpathogenen Pilzen geschrieben. Ich freue mich sehr auf iGEM, weil wir unser eigenes Projekt erarbeitet haben an dem wir selbstständig planen und arbeiten können. Diese Erfahrung wird mit Sicherheit sehr herausfordernd sein aber auch viel Spaß machen – und natürlich werden wir eine ganze Menge dabei lernen!
Wenn ich keine PCRs ansetzte, kloniere oder lernen muss kann ich mich sehr für Sport, wie z.B. Football, Surfen oder Basketball, begeistern. Und natürlich reise ich gerne, wenn die nötige Zeit und vor allem Geld zur Verfügung steht.

Patrick Reinke
Hallo liebe Besucher! Ich bin Patrick und nehme ebenfalls am Master-Programm ""Mikrobiologie und Biochemie"" an der Universität Göttingen teil. Meinen Bachelor of Science habe ich an der Leibniz-Universität Hannover gemacht. Ich war über zwei Jahre Mitglied der Schierwater-Arbeitsgruppe im Institut für Tierökologie und Zellbiologe der Stiftung Tierärtzliche Hochschule. Ich arbeitete dort an potentiellen Nervensystemen und Taxisverhalten von dem basalen Mehrzeller Trichoplax adhaerens und sammelte viele Erfahrungen im Bereich der Genetik und experimenteller Biologie. In meinem Master versuche ich nun die genetischen Aspekte mit detailiertem Wissen im Bereich der Biochemie zu ergänzen. Als Kommilitonen berichtet haben, dass sie mit einem interessanten Projekt an dem iGEM-Wettbewerb teilnehmen wollen, habe ich mich sofort gemeldet, um dem Team beizutreten. Auch um einen ersten Einblick in das Projektmanagement und -finanzierung von wissenschaftlichen Projekten zu bekommen.

Flash Coli
Hey alle! Mein Name ist Flash Coli und ich bin als schnellstes Darmbakterium der Welt bekannt. Es gibt viele Gerüchte, wie ich geboren wurde, aber ich kann versichern, dass einige von diesen sind maßlos übertrieben und nicht erfreulich! Diesen Sommer unterstützte ich das Team Göttingen während deren Arbeit für iGEM. Als ein großer Liebhaber des Klonens, Anziehen von Kulturen und BioBrick design bin ich der perfekter Helfer. Also, mein Schnelligkeit ist eine große Hilfe, weil das Labor auf dem ""Faßberg"" aka dem kleinen Bruder des Mount Everests liegt, und die Studenten nur Fahrräder besitzen. Daher kann ich leicht alle möglichen Geräte von den Universitätsgebäuden zu unserem Labor am MPI bringen.
Ich freue mich alle anderen europäischen Teams in Amsterdam zu treffen. Bleibt Coli!
Focus Group: Kann in allen Gruppen simultan arbeiten.
Zusätzliche Arbeitsbereiche: Schneller zu sein als der Blitz.

Anna Maria Köhler
Hello my name is Anna and I am a student of the Microbiology and Biochemistry Master in Göttingen, as well. First a short story about how I decided to become a biologist: When I was in school, we had a practical week of genetics with a professor from an university. Since this laboratory experience, I decided to study biology and to become a scientist! I did my bachelor thesis in the department of Molecular Structural Biology in Göttingen, where I became a fan of proteins. Participating the iGEM team means very much to me because I am looking forward to work independently and I like to develop new ideas in a group of students.

Bianca Genenncher
Hello everybody. My name is Bianca Genenncher and it is my second year of the Biochemistry and Microbiology Master of the University of Göttingen. During my Bachelor studies in Göttingen my main focus pointed towards the Molecular Plant Biology examining the plant´s molecular reaction to invading pathogens. Last year, I was studying in Scotland at the University of Aberdeen. I really enjoyed my time abroad working together with students from other countries with interesting cultural backgrounds, but I also admire the beautiful nature of course. This is my first iGEM participation and I like being a part of the first iGEM team of the University of Göttingen. I am highly motivated to start doing the experiments and gain the first experience designing own experiments. Another reason for me to participate is the internationality of this competition. I am looking forward to have rewarding discussions about the results or different ways to reach the aim with my team members.

As well as all the others around, I am a student of the Microbiology and Biochemistry master´s program at the University of Göttingen. Currently, I am in my second semester. I finished my bachelor in August 2011 at the Technical University of Munich (TUM) in the field of Molecular Biotechnology after six semesters of study. During my time in Munich, I heard of iGEM for the first time. Some of my former fellow students participated in an iGEM Team for the TUM in 2011. Their stories stunned me very much and I wanted to join a team by myself as fast as possible. I worked for my Bachelor's thesis at the Chair of Proteomics of Prof. Küster at the Faculty of Life Science (TUM), where I had a lot planning and working on my own. By doing this, I had a lot of fun and I think to re-experience this during our iGEM project.

Hello everybody, my name is Jan Kampf and I am pursuing also the MSc/PhD program in ""Microbiology and Biochemistry"" at the Georg-August University of Göttingen. I received my Bachelor of Science in the field of Molecular Biology in 2011 at the Faculty of Biology of the University of Göttingen as well. For my bachelor thesis ""Insights into Mammalian SIRT6 Function in Cellular Stress Response"" I worked at the Max-Planck-Institute for Biophysical Chemistry, Göttingen. During my time as a bachelor's student in the Max-Planck-Institute for Biophysical Chemistry I had the opportunity to work in an environment with people from various countries raised in different and diverse cultures. It was a great time for me and motivated me to spend a period of time working again on a project, which allows earning experience in autonomous efforts and planning of our project. So I am really looking forward to our iGEM project for the opportunity to work independently in a team of young students as well as the opportunity to present our work and the results to a multicultural audience and the exchange of experiences during the time of the iGEM project of the other teams.

Nikolas Rakebrandt
Hello everybody, my name is Nikolas Rakebrandt and I am currently studying in the second semester of the MSc ""Microbiology and Biochemistry"" program in Göttingen. Before my career as a scientist, I made a little detour and hold a BSc in Business Administration and Economics from the University of Passau. After this, I acquired my Biology BSc in Göttingen with a thesis about effector proteins of plant pathogenic fungi. I am really looking forward to iGEM because it will be ""our"" project and we will be able to work and plan on this autonomously. I think this will be very challenging and fun, not to mention that we will probably learn a great deal!
When I am not busy with PCRs, cloning or studying I am very much into sports like football, surfing or basketball. Also, I like travelling whenever there is time (and money) or just being outside.

Hello everybody! I am Patrick and also student of the Masters program ""Microbiology and Biochemistry"" at the Georg-August University in Göttingen. I earned my Bachelor of science at the Leibniz University in Hannover. I was member of the Schierwater-workgroup in the Institute of ecology and evolution of the Stiftung Tierärtzliche Hochschule Hannover for over 2 years. My workfield was taxis-behaviour and potential early-evolution neuro-systems on Trichoplax adhaerens. I gathered many experiences in the workfield of genetics and experimental biology. Within my Master I want to complement this experiences with detailed biochemical knowledge. In the beginning of this year fellow students told me that they want to participate at the iGEM competition. The interesting Project catched me so I joined the team immediately. I think this Project is also a good first experience of scientific projectmanagement and financing.

Flash Coli
Hey everybody! My name is Flash Coli and I am known as the fastest gut bacterium on earth. There are many rumors on how I was born but I can assure you some of them are hughely exaggerated and not very pleasant! This summer I supported the Team Göttingen during their work for iGEM. As a big fancier of cloning, growing cultures and BioBrick design I am the perfect addition to this team. Also, my speed is a huge help since the lab is located on the ""Faßberg"" aka the little brother of Mount Everest, and the students are only equipped with bikes. Therefore, I can easily take all kinds of equipment from the university buildings to our lab at the MPI.
I am looking forward to meet all the other European teams in Amsterdam. Stay Coli!
Focus Group: Can work in all groups simultaneously.
Additional jobs: Being faster than a flash.

Undergrads:
Jean Cury
1st year master student in Biology at the ENS Paris and UPMC, Paris 6
My current internship is about studying a synthetic recombination site of the integron system, at Pasteur Institute, Paris. This gives me a good insight into synthetic biology, and motivates me to participate in iGEM. What attracts me also in doing iGEM is the interdisciplinary team, the team reflexion, and everything about creating a team, organizing it, learning from other fields represented. Indeed, I truly believe that learning from your friends is a good way to improve your knowledge and satisfy your curiosity. In addition to my internship, I'm following bioinformatics and arabic courses.
Dylan Iverson
1st year master student in Biomedical Engineering at Paris Descartes University
I am a first year student of the Master of Biomedical Engineering at Paris Descartes. My undergraduate degree is Engineering Bachelor of Science: Chemical Engineering from University of California, Santa Barbara. I have done completed my first 2-month internship for M1 in neurobiology, and iGem will serve as my second internship. I discovered the topic of synthetic biology by taking Jake Wintermute’s course for the AIV Master. In contrast with biology students, I have more knowledge of mathematical modeling and chemistry. I am particularly interested in metabolic engineering. I hope to do what I can to make us all synthetic biology champions.
Zoran Marinkovic
1st year AIV master student at Paris Descartes University
I studied Molecular Biology at University of Zagreb (Croatia) and did a semester long exchange at Uppsala University (Sweden) where I studied Microbial and Evolutionary Genetics and Bioinformatics. Currently, I’m doing a 5 month long internship at INSERM U1001 under the supervision of Jake Wintermute tackling the question of bacterial aging using the synthetic biology approach.  My primary interest is application of synthetic biology for creating bioproducts as well as using synthetic biology in fundamental research. Also, I’m quite interested in developing synthetic biology as a tool for creating living organisms from scratch as we build many non-living constructs today.  I joined iGEM because I would like to experience and observe the process of generating ideas and creating a science project with a group of people which, I hope, will be interesting and fun to do. Of course, it has to be the Grand Prize winning one.
Claire Mayer
3rd year of Medical School and 1st year AIV master student at Paris Descartes University
I think Synthetic Biology has a tremendous potential, and especially for medical and environmental applications.   iGEM is my M1 internship. I wanted to join the iGEM team in order to work in a pluridisciplinary environment on an exciting synthetic biology project, and learn a lot from each participant, and let them learn from me.  What do I do apart from studying?  I am Co President of Paris Descartes’ Debating Club and I give lessons to an adult class in biology (in preparation of an exam called “le brevet adulte”). I love genetics and immunology.
Denis Samuylov
1st year AIV master student at Paris Diderot University
I finished my undergraduate studies in 2011 in Saint Petersburg State Polytechnical University in Russia. I was learning technical and physical courses, e.g. Electrodynamics, Optics, Quantum Physics, Math, Statistics, Computer Sciences, Electronics… At the moment, I am in the first year of the Interdisciplinary Approaches to Life Science (AIV) Master Program and I fell in love with Biology... or rather Synthetic Biology! So, with my interdisciplinary background I intend to apply my numerous skills to make humanity’s life better and save the world. I am deeply interested in fighting cancer and to participate in ecological projects. I am sure that participation in iGEM is a great possibility to meet interesting people, share my skills and to learn something new! And of course to have a fun summer while realizing useful project! As for my other interests, I love sports, dancing, music, nature and life!
Aishah Prastowo
1st year AIV master student at Paris Descartes University
Before my master I did Engineering Physics in Gadjah Mada University Indonesia. As my final project of my undergraduate, I studied microfluidics and did a project on low-cost microfluidic system for generating biomicrobubbles. Currently I am doing my internship about real-time control of gene expression in yeast. For me engineering is all about systems design and modeling, making innovation and troubleshooting, and so is synthetic biology. I hope I can learn both science and soft skills by participating in iGEM, while contributing my best for the team.
Julianne Rieders
1st year AIV master student at Paris Descartes University
I earned my B.A. at Bryn Mawr College, Bryn Mawr Pa, where I studied biology and East Asian studies. I am primarily interested in molecular therapeutics, and believe that the application of synthetic and systems biology to this field will allow for the development of safer more efficient treatments. I am currently involved in a hardcore synthetic biology project working with both bacterial and mammalian cells. Participating in iGEM is an ideal opportunity to apply and share my skills in this field, as well as expand my skill set, in an exciting and competitive environment.
Ernest Mordret
2nd year AIV master student at Paris Diderot University and 3rd year at AgroParisTech
By the end of high school, I had quite a hard time choosing between biology studies and the classical engineering track. Thus, iGEM and synthetic biology are a way to use this engineering approach in order to serve my passion for biology. I am deeply interested in the robustness of synthetic gene circuits and in the development of innovative directed evolution strategies. During my internships and theoretical trainings, I acquired skills in population genetics, molecular biology and microfluidics, and I will try to bring as much energy, commitment, suggestions and solutions as possible for the team!
Guillaume Villain
1st year Frontiers in Life Science bachelor student at Paris Descartes University
I am really interested in synthetic biology, modeling of biological systems, education, directed evolution and protein engineering. I would like especially to know more about extremophilic protein, which is why I am doing an internship in the institute of physico-chemical biology (IBPC, Paris) in a bioinformatics laboratory to study molecular modeling of extremophilic protein. I love interdisciplinarity and I think iGEM is a fantastic opportunity to learn a lot about synthetic biology and sciences in an innovative way.

Jenna Klein
is a sophomore at MIT studying Mechanical Engineering with a minor in Biomedical Engineering. Jenna is excited about participating in iGEM because she wants to learn more about synthetic biology. She is interested in synthetic biology because after many years of athletics, she has experienced injury and encountered both kids and adults who have not been able to play a sport because of their physical disabilities. She believes that people can’t control diseases that they might be born with, and that shouldn’t keep people out. In the future, she wants to be able to design something in order to improve the lives of other people. She likes how iGEM is a rare experience where she can come up with her own project idea and work on it with the team. In the past year, she has been conducting research with the Langer Lab at MIT, working on building a scaffold which can be electrically stimulated to allow nerve cells to regenerate faster and with less scar tissue. Jenna is also a goalie for MIT’s Men’s Ice Hockey Team and Varsity Field Hockey Team and a sister of Sigma Kappa sorority.

Rahul Sarpeshkar
obtained his Bachelor's degrees in Electrical Engineering and Physics at MIT. After completing his PhD at Caltech, he joined Bell Labs as a member of technical staff in the department of Biological Computation within its Physics division. Since 1999, he has been on the faculty of MIT's Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Department where he heads a research group on Analog Circuits and Biological Systems . His invention of cytomorphic electronics, outlined in his recent book, Ultra Low Power Bioelectronics: Fundamentals, Biomedical Applications, and Bio-inspired Systems, has established an important bridge between electronics and chemistry. This work lays a foundation for a rigorous analog circuits approach to systems biology and synthetic biology. His current research on synthetic biology applies analog circuit techniques to the design, analysis, implementation, and supercomputing chip-based simulation of biochemical networks in E coli and yeast. It has applications in architecting a scalable platform technology and conceptual framework for design that is broadly applicable in all of synthetic biology. It also has specific applications in the treatment of diabetes, antibiotic resistance, and the design of microbial fuel cells. He has received several awards including the NSF Career Award, the ONR Young Investigator Award, the Packard Fellows Award and the Indus Technovator Award for his interdisciplinary bioengineering research.

Our instructors and other individuals from outside the Weiss lab provided the training necessary for us to conduct our work. Deepak Mishra, one of our advisors, taught cloning techniques and fluorescence microscopy on the Zeiss scope, assisted with FACS training, and operated the confocal microscope. Jonathan Babb, also an advisor, helped teach cloning techniques and assisted the team with the liquid handling robot. Initial tissue culture training was conducted by Kenneth Hu, a member of the 2011 MIT iGEM team. FACS training was also conducted by Glenn Paradis, manager of the Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research Flow Cytometry Core Facility. We were lucky to have Lulu Qian, whose work inspired our project, advise our team. Her feedback on design strategies and technical details for our project was invaluable. We would also like to thank the 2011 MIT iGEM team for providing our wiki design.  Without all of these contributions, our work this summer would not have been possible.
Otherwise, all of the data presented on the results page was generated by members of the 2012 MIT iGEM team, with the exception of some microscopy, time-lapse images in particular.

About the Team
Already in December 2011 brainstorming sessions about the iGEM project for 2012 had started. Around 100 ideas had been considered, but around March 2012 the decision was made: we were going to modify VLPs.
""Constanter Elaboranti Requiescere Est Suave"" - After a hard day's work a man should rest. We did not only work very hard in the lab, but also organized team-building activities. We had a lot of fun, during which Agneya wrecked his knee:

Collaborations
We collaborated with team Evry to investigate if TAL-based transcriptional regulators are functional in cells of amphibians and in multicellular animals. Frog oocytes and embryos transfected with plasmids containing mCitrine reporter under the minimal promoter and an upstream TAL-operator exhibited fluorescence when it was cotransfected with TAL-VP16 activator. This fluorescence was absent in cells and animals that were transfected only with the mCitrine reporter (described in the Switch section ). This collaborative result demonstrates that TAL based genetic logic could be used to regulate complex properties in multicellular organisms, which has many important implications for the potential therapeutic use.
We provided parts that were not included in the distribution to the Warsaw team .
We provided additional information about the part development to Peking team .
We were pleased when the Wageningen team sent us a mail after the European jamboree that they were amazed by our project and that they introduced features of our pharmacokinetic model into their project.
We participated in the survey of TU Munich team .
We had discussions with a member of St. Andrews team that visited us. We welcome all other visitors as well.

Team composition
Team is composed of 11 undergraduate students of biochemistry, biotechnology, medicine and informatics and computer sciences at the University of Ljubljana, two of which finished their undergraduate study during the summer and one of them enrolled in October 2012 to the PhD study of biomedicine.
Team selection
The 2012 Slovenian iGEM team was selected among more than 40 candidates who replied to the team member recruitment announcement posted at the end of December 2011. An initial meeting of candidates with advisers announced the challenge of this year's project - to find a synthetic biological solution for medical therapy using biological drugs. Out of the candidates that attended the initial meeting, 18 candidates submitted their proposal for the project by the end of February.
Eight wet lab team members were selected based on the interviews with team advisers in March while the three computer modeling team members were selected by advisers from the Faculty of informatics and computer sciences. The team started with experimental work towards the end of April and more intensively at the end of June after the summer exams.
Contribution of student team members:
contributed ideas for the project
performed all cloning (the ‘masters of cloning’ were mainly Boštjan and Fedja, with help of all the other students, Uroš, Miha, Lucija, Anja, Zala, Urban)

Induction in mammalian cells
At the initiation of the project the host lab only had a tetracycline induction system. Induction systems with ecdysone and rapalogues were purchased (Agilent Technologies and Clontech Laboratories, respectively).
We thank Prof. Martin Fussenegger who kindly provided all the genetic components for establishing the erythromycin and pristinamycin induction systems.
All five induction systems were adapted for the project purposes by the addition of TAL regulators. Because of the MTA limitations the induction systems could not be deposited into the Registry.
TAL effectors
The 2010 Slovenian iGEM team prepared NicTAL, a TAL effector designed to bind to the teto1 operator, which however did not work as expected so the team performed experimental work using zinc finger proteins instead. This year's team discovered that a subdomain of TAL essential for the activity, which was not known at that time, was missing from NicTAL. The missing domain was added and NicTAL activator and repressor constructs were prepared and their functionality was demonstrated.
KRAB domain, VP16 domain and minimal promoter (Pmin) were contributed by the host lab.
TAL effectors 59, 95 and 97 were obtained via AddGene from Joung's lab, ""Biobricked"" and used for the construction of TAL activators, repressors and genetic switch devices. The team prepared TAL-based activators and repressors by adding VP16 and KRAB domain, respectively, where all wet lab team members participated in the experimental work. Different positions of KRAB with respect to TAL DNA- binding domain and number of KRAB domains were investigated by team members (Lucija).
Gene synthesis
binding sites for TAL effectors were ordered from IDT
DNA blocks for the assembly of Pseudoalteromonas elyakovii alginate lyase with an optimized codon sequence where ordered from IDT and cloned by Urban.
Pseudomonas aeruginosa alginate lyase
A P. aeruginosa strain was generously donated by Prof. Guillermo Martínez de Tejada, whom we kindly thank for his support.
Cell microencapsulation
The host lab obtained cell microencapsulator in the middle of 2011.
Team advisor Anže supervised microencapsuation, which was performed by Urban.
Therapeutic effectors
The host lab contributed a clone for IL1RA (anakinra), while all other effectors (IFN-alpha, MICA, VEGF, PDGF) were purchased from Sino Biological and were cloned by team members into the appropriate vectors and deposited into the Registry (Lucija, Boštjan and Fedja). Biological activity of anakinra and IFN-alpha and determination of their concentration were measured by team members (Urban, Lucija, Miha).
Cell killing assay
NK cells were from the ATCC. Cell killing assays were performed by microscopy and flow cytometry by students (Anja and Lucija), with supervision on the microscope and flow cytometer by advisers (Mojca, Alja, Tina).
Modeling of switches and pharmacokinetics
All modeling was performed by student members (Dušan, Martin, Maja in consultation on the biological questions with Boštjan, Miha and Urban).
Wiki
Wiki including all animations and images was prepared by students and edited by the advisers.
3D models
3d models of human anatomy used for visualization purposes were obtained from BodyParts3D database, available at http://dbarchive.biosciencedbc.jp/en/bodyparts3d/desc.html
For real-time pharmacokinetic 3D simulation purposes, the models were converted to OpenGL-friendly format using obj2opengl, available at: http://heikobehrens.net/2009/08/27/obj2opengl
TAL regulators in Xenopus laevis
The experiment with TALA:VP16 and 10x[TALA]_pMIN_mCitrine in Xenopus laevis was performed by team Evry , during our colaboration.

UC Merced Advisors
Marcos Garcia-Ojeda, a professor for the School of Natural Sciences has provided us with his insight and intellectual knowledge throughout the whole project. He has graciously provided his lab space to the team and taught us proper lab techniques and protocols. He stressed communication between each other is necessary to make sure the project is running smoothly. Finally, he has helped us in finalizing our project idea to make sure we had decided on a project that we would enjoy, as well as ensure we were trained properly in lab procedures.
Wei-Chun Chin, a bioengineering professor for the School of Engineering, who has helped us in developing the project ideas and process during the brainstorming sessions early in our project considerations. During the brainstorming sessions his knowledge has guided us towards a project that would be appealing to the mass.
Financials
We want to thank School of Engineering and School of Natural Sciences. They have graciously helped us out in funding for our laboratory supplies. We want to specifically like to thank Dean Hirleman and Dean Meza for giving us the opportunity recalling from last semester that we had to pitch the idea of forming a UC Merced iGEM team. Without their help and the help of the school now of the experiments we done in the laboratory would be possible.
The registration for both the team registration and the team members regional jamboree attendance fee has been funded by the Associated Students of the University of California Merced (ASUCM). ASUCM is here to help the students by promoting the enhancement of the academic benefits and opportunities offered for the  continues of students at UC Merced.
Laboratory Related
The Departement of Microbiology at Oregon State University, specifically the Giovannoni Lab has provided us with Methylophilales bacterium HTCC2181.It is an Isolate of OM43, a cluster of one of the most abundant beta-Proteobacteria in coastal marine 16S clone libraries. Amy Carter has been the logistics person whom we have spoken to about receiving the bacteria and deserves a special thanks.
UC Davis iGEM team has helped us by providing a lot of insightful knowledge as they are an experienced team. They also pointed us towards the Gibson Assembly Method and said because we are are a rookie team, we should establish little milestones to characterize success.
Primers were designed by students and produced by Eurofins. Protocol kits were obtained from Fisher Scientific, and restriction enzymes were obtained from New England Biolabs.
Yale University and the E. Coli Genetic Stock Center (CGSG)has helped by providing two strains of E. Coli which are FMJ39 and JW1228. These are the two strains where we are using to provide as hosts for our hydrogen E. Coli. Without Yale’s CGSC and the ability to mutate and knockout specific genes our project would not be able to succeed as it is a basis for our hypothesis.

Who we are
Our iGEM team is a group of seven students and three mentors.
As we are a team of only ten people, and the iGEM competition is a new experience for many of us, we work closely together on all aspects of our work. There is no graph, no abstract, not even a single presentation slide that isn't enthusiastically discussed by the whole team. We divide our lab work as well, so that each of us has spent some time working on the other modules.
All of us are working closely together with our two instructors Prof. Thorsten Mascher and Dr. Tina Wecke and our advisor Dr. Georg Fritz. Prof. Thorsten Mascher is not only offering us a place in his lab, but also a lot of support and input on all parts of the project. Tina is the one to go to for trouble shooting and strategy planning, and Georg is advising us how to best evaluate parts and how to model.
We have a lot of fun working together on Beadzillus!
Where we are from
München mag dich!
This is the slogan of Munich, the city where our team is from. It stands for the cosmopolitan character of Munich. But it is also a declaration of love to its citizens. All of us enjoy the variety of activities that Munich has to offer. The inner city shows traces of Munich|s history, the English Garden provides the space for sunny or snowy days, quarters are complete with diverse museums, galleries, cafes and bars... In many of these quarters you will meet many students, on the run or relaxing between classes, as two universities are located in Munich, Technical University of Munich (TUM) and Ludwig-Maximilians-University Munich (LMU) . We study at the LMU, which is famous for over 500 years of research in academics. We comprise the LMU's third iGEM team. Working hard in the lab, we strive to make the LMU, and the city of Munich, proud of our accomplishments in this year's competition.

We Are...PENN STATE!
The Penn State iGEM team this year consists of 5 undergraduate members and 1 high school student. In the past few months, we have learned the basics of synthetic biology from scratch, had ups and downs, and best of all...HAD FUN!
Undergraduate Student Researchers
 
 
 
Victoria Heasly
Victoria Heasley will be a junior next year at Penn State University studying bio-engineering. She currently works as an iGEM team member on the Codon Optimization Project. Other then synthetic biology research, she helps research in the bio mechanics lab during the school year.
Outside of school work she is a director of the Engineering Orientation and Networking (EON), which is the orientation through the College of Engineering for all 1,000 first year engineering students. Additionally, she acts as a representative for the Schreyer Honor College to prospective students, families, alumni and guests as a member of the Schreyer Advancement Team. Finally, she is a member of the Presidential Leadership Academy at Penn State. Outside of academic activities, she loves to dance; it has been her passion and favorite hobby for 15 years. She has loved her time at Penn State and can't wait for the next two years. This year on the iGEM team at Penn State, she has the position of ""joyologist"".
 
 
 
Chris Cetnar
Chris is in his third year here at Penn State University focusing my studies in Biology/Vertebrate Physiology. He learned about the field of synthetic biology in a molecular biology class, and knew he had to get involved in this cutting edge research. He joined Penn State's iGEM team this summer and will be heading the promoter directionality project.
He is heavily involved with many of Penn State's extracurricular activities like club basketball and recently founded Penn State Dodgeball Club. He holds officer positions in Biology Club, Pre-Dental Society, and Science Lions and he works as a teaching assistant and serve as a resident assistant in the dorm halls. He loves Penn State and wants to wish all the iGEM teams good luck this year! ""Imagination is more important than knowledge."" -Einstein
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Hannah Jepsen-Burger
Hannah is a junior from Reading, PA majoring in Food Science. She appreciated the applications of synthetic biology in agriculturally-related fields, and hopes to find employment developing gluten substitutes. Hannah is heading the Multiple Start Codon project.
 
 
 
Kait Levin
Kait Levin is a Junior in Biological Engineering at Penn State. She joined iGEM in order to understand more about the constructs of life and how they work and is currently working on the Codon Optimization project. Outside of the classroom she is involved with the American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers, Women in Engineering Program, Vole (ballet club), and is an Auxiliary Officer with the Penn State Police. She enjoys music festivals, the movie Office Space, and long naps in the sun.
 
 
 
Kevin Thyne
Kevin is a Junior in Molecular Biology and Biochemistry. He joined iGEM for the opportunity to work in a lab, and do new, exciting research. Kevin is also involved in the American Society of Microbiology (ASM) and the National Society of Collegiate Scholars (NSCS). In his free time he works on chainmail and lamellar armor.
 
 
 
Alexander Woskob
Alexander Woskob is a Junior at State College Area High School. Although Alexander has always wanted to build a space station on the moon, capable of supporting human life, he is instead pursuing his interests in biology and genetics by working on the Penn State iGEM team. Alexander believes science is the agent which will push society to further develop. He looks to better the world through biology and genetics, and maybe one day build a habitat on the moon.

Who did what
Winter quarter marked the beginning of participation for this year's team for both students and advisors alike. Advisors helped students to familiarize themselves with the intricacies of synthetic biology by recommending published scientific papers and holding weekly meetings. In addition, students also familiarized themselves with previous year's Washington iGEM projects and gave presentations about them. During spring quarter, the team progressed into giving another round of presentations in which published scientific papers concerning synthetic biology were the topics of interest. Students, being well prepared and acquainted with the inner workings of iGEM and synthetic biology, then brainstormed and chose their projects with the guidance of advisors. The team participated in UW Engineering Discovery Days in which Students shared synthetic biology concepts with budding young scientists and educators alike. During the summer, students worked diligently on their chosen experiments while accepting counsel from both advisors and faculty.
The work on this wiki is solely the work of iGEM students and does not reflect the work of any host lab, advisor, or instructor involved in iGEM.

Welcome to our team page
Our final achievement was made possible by the hard work and anticipation of the people of our team.
Teams
Degradation
Marie Burghard Dipl. Biology
Master of SOE PCR and SDS-bubbles
Marie is one of the few remaining diploma of the TU Darmstadt and the only one of their kind that made it to our iGEM team.
If you need someone to keep a cool head and a bunch of testosterone driven menfolk in control there is no way around her.
She is skilled in all kind of genetic methods and even knows how to play the piano.
Jascha Dimer M.Sc. Biomolecular Engineering
Master of SOE PCR
Although it required some force to make Jascha join our iGEM team he never regretted joining us. Nor did we.
Together with Marie he dealt with the isolation of FsC and Est13 via SOE PCR and kept up the working spirit.
To start with iGEM was his chance to realize a project that involves going beyond the usual university project limits. We went far...
Adrian Eilingsfeld M.Sc. Biomolecular Engineering
Trainee in BioBrick production and god of wikimedia
Adrians objective was the construction of BioBricks based on the fusion proteins sub units.
When time was running short he took up the challenge and started the wiki.
He's a constant source of wicked ideas: He implemented the laser thermometer as labware, likes rockets and owns a 3D printer.
Philipp Rottmann M.Sc. Biomolecular Engineering
Master of BioBrick production and god of overexpression of FsC/Est13
Philipp represented our iGEM team on severall occasions, cared for our public relations, funding and to put us into good humor.
Yet he insited to spend time in the laboratory. Without him the lab wouldn't be the same.
He is one of the alltime enthusiastic kind who always gives a helping hand and makes teamwork a pleasant experience.
Renè Sahm B.Sc. Biomolecular Engineering
God of activity assays
Renè joined the iGEM teams as soon as he heard about it.
In the lab, playing Dota or Pen'n'Paper role plays, Renè is always in search of a challenge and gives his best while having a lot of fun.
With his experience from earlier lab work he was a gain for our group
Arne Wehling B.Sc. Biomolecular Engineering
Team leader and god of SOE PCR
Arne is a great team leader. He is confident and doesn't hesitate to kick ass if required but doesn't mind to pay attention to trivial matters.
Although he classifies himself as a tough guy and trains boxing on a regular basis, the only one who ended up with a black  eye (twice) was himself, after some close quarter combats (sparring). He is extremely dedicated trying to bring science to the people.
Niklas Weber PhD student of biochemistry
Team Advisor and god of teaching molecular biology
As an advisor Niklas always gave his best.
No matter when we could always trust in his expertise and experience
He gave good advice and hope in even bad times, which we had definitly. We are glad to had him as an advisor
Transport
from left to right: Sebastian, Valentina, Malte/Max, Andreas
Malte Blumenroth B.Sc. Biomolecular Engineering
Master of competent E. coli cells.
No one else produced better competent cells in our lab.
He also did a good job developing a photometric system to measure TPA uptake.
Max Heumüller B.Sc. Biology
Master of translation
Max couldn't spend much time in the wet lab,
so he decided to translate our lab protocols.
Valentina Herbring M.Sc. Biomolecular Engineering
Master of documentation
Valentina ist not only the ""Mama"" of our team, but also the helping hand in every situation.
She went almost mad in the lab with Andreas but never left until work was done. In this lab italian passion met russion havoc.
Beside beeing the Master of Documentation Vali also showed outstanding miniprep skills.
Andreas Schmidt B.Sc. Biomolecular Engineering
Team leader and master of improvisation
A russian dictator is nothing compared to this lab worker. Chaos seems to be a normal thing for Andi and a lab without chaos wouldn't be challenging
enough. But he is also the only one who succeeds to find the right sample in the right moment.
Andreas basically lived in the lab for many weeks.
Sebastian Palluk B.Sc. Biology
Master of mutagenic PCR
Sebastian managed it to eliminate the PstI restriction site in tctA 505aa trying only one time, while others spent weeks fighting against it.
He also managed to fight against the ""normal"" chaos in our lab  and spent many hours discussing strategies and design of new primers with Andreas.
Sebastian was representing biologists in our lab, surrounded by chemists and biomolecular engineers.
Metabolism
Sascha Hein B.Sc. Biomolecular Engineering
Team leader and god of GLP
Sascha is a certified biological technical assistant and decided to lead the metabolism team.
His internalized skills and knowledge on a variety of methods make him essential for succesfull labwork.
He even went so far to be ready to sleep over at the lab.
Sven Rumpf B.Sc. Chemistry
Master of gel leak-proof gel chambers
Sven took iGEM as a chance to expand his skills on biotechnology.
Nevertheless he taught us to assemble an SDS-PAGE that
could withstand thousands of liters of resolving and stacking gel.
Daniel Sachs B.Sc. Biomolecular Engineering
Master of colony picking
Daniel is the perfect man for colony PCR.
Unfortunately his transformation and ligation skills are afflicted
by his tendency to lose tubes with plasmid DNA in his ice box.
Material Science
Velten Horn B.Sc. Chemistry
Master of AFM and PET synthesis
Velten was the teams good soul keeping everybody calm in stressing situations.
Entertaining everone in the long hours of using the AFM was one of his easiest tasks.
If he wasn´t synthecising PET or taking AFM images he could be found playing smartphone games addictedly, emptying everyones batterie.
Jonas von Irmer B.Sc. Chemistry
Team leader, god of AFM and synthesis
Jonas evolved from a mere spectator to team leader. Showing an enormous desire to make a contribution.
As a chemist he provided crucial skills and synthesised PET analoga.
His endurance using the AFM lead to beautiful pictures but also a big pile of broken cantilevers.
Henner Zirpel M.Sc. Chemistry
Master of the vanishing product
Henner lead the team until he began his studies abroad.
He took care of PET synthesis being the first one ever to evaporate PET at a temperature of 170 °C
Nevertheless he was an excellent companion and pleasant to work with.
Simulation
Sven Jager M.Sc. Biomolecular Engineering
God of simulation
Sven turned out to be our personal genius on simulation and modeling. When he presented his first data we were stunned and pretty
much didn't know what to say. As a consequence he reduced his data to a threshold that common people understand (images).
Even though he usually evites lab work he ended up performing the GC-MS measurements with great success.
Henrik Cordes M.Sc. Biomolecular Engineering
Under the watchful eyes of Sven Henrik performed homology modelings and MD simulations
for the iGEM Frankfurt team as well as for our team.
Some computers couldn't take it (crashed) but it was worth it ....
Wiki
Patrick Boba PhD Biology (Bioinformatics)
Wiki
Patrick was pretty much dragged into this mess.
He helped setting up and proofread the modeling section
and expanded his fields of operations when the time ran short.
Adrian Eilingsfeld M.Sc. Biomolecular Engineering
God of Wiki
Adrian pretty much pulled the short straw and ended up with the wiki and all its wonderful side effects:
Sleep deprivation, mood swings, spontaneous burst of laughter and the infinite wisdom on ditching the wiki task next time it crosses his path.
He is our secret weapon. He can be used in the dry and in the wet lab, always giving his best.
Human Resources & Coordination
Henrik Cordes M.Sc. Biomolecular Engineering
Project management and activity assignment
Henrik was one of the first to come up with the idea to enter the iGEM competition.
He soon started coordinating and setting up the team.
....
Philipp Rottmann M.Sc. Biomolecular Engineering
Master of public relations
Philipp represented our iGEM team on severall occasions, cared for our public relations and funding.
He performed sparkling during our human practices and attracted the crowds like nobody else.
He is one of the alltime enthusiastic kind who always gives a helping hand and makes teamwork a pleasant experience.

Menno Witteveen
Menno Witteveen
Hi! My name is Menno and I work on various aspects of our iGEM project. My special interests lie on new modeling approaches, tightly coupled with the experimental approaches of the lab. Nice examples are: Applying information theory to signaling cascades, using numerical methods for optimal experimental design, especially in the light of intercellular noise. I also do labwork, but I hope one day, that we will only have robots and microfluidics in the lab, that can do the work for us, so we can work on other more abstract problems. I also have a strong interest in personalized medicine!

When people say iGEM, they also say synthetic biology. My first impression when I heard about iGEM was: ’’that seems really awesome iGEM, but what is synthetic biology? I only followed high school biology, help!’’
I am a bachelor student with a major in Aerospace Engineering. My tasks in this team are taking care of the Human Practice, doing some minipreps in the lab, and being the team manager. Besides a fulltime summer spending on iGEM, I like to do gymnastics and salsa dancing.

Dear mother, iGEM contestant from another team or random person who googled my name. I'm the stowaway from the university of Leiden who ended up in this team. My main jobs are playing around with pipettes and colouring inside of the lines, which can be seen on the wiki and our posters. With Biology as my main background I got a chance to work with plants, animals and micro-organisms. Although every aspect of life is equally interesting, the simplicity and -at the same time- complexity of bacteria led me in the direction of microbiology. During my bachelor internship under the supervision of Dennis Claessen I have worked with Streptomyces, a soil organism which is not only important for our ecosystem, but also for us! These bacteria produce a wide array of different antibiotics, at least three quarter of the antibiotics we use originate from these bacteria. The iGEM competition was announced during a work discussion and the following week I was paying my first visit to Delft.  The iGEM is a great opportunity to spend some time on the playground of genetic engineering and to learn more about this young area of research.

For several years I have been employed at Kluyver laboratory for Biotechnology at the Enzymology section as a supporting staff member on education and research.
To be an integral part of TUDelft’s iGEM supervisor team gives me the unique chance to apply different facets of my own education to this year's interdisciplinary team. Next to this it’s a challenge to use my technical knowledge and distinctive expertise with membrane associated research to support and tutor an inspired group of upcoming synthetic biologists.
In addition, I supervise several Bachelor and Master students that are doing their internship at my department. I'm looking forward to the European Jamboree in Amsterdam and see all the fascinating and challenging work done at iGEM!  See you all there!! ;)

My name is Sietske Grijseels and I just started with the Master Life Science and Technology in Delft. During the iGEM competition I mainly focus on the wetlab work. I started with iGEM because I was really curious about synthetic biology and the possibilities of standardization in biology. See you in Boston!

Hi all! iGEM came along on my blackboard page and I decided to have a look.. I am a bachelor student in Maritime Engineering, so I basically study steel and water and there is not a lot of DNA involved. But I strongly believe in combining knowledge of different fields, so I had a look and applied! Before I knew it, I was surrounded by biologists, chemists and control engineering students! Especially the lab is filled with miracles for me, it is very exciting to see what synthetic biology can do! This project convinced me even more of the fact a multidisciplinary team has a lot of potential and gives every team member an oppurtunity to learn in other fields of science.

I'm a system theorist and control engineer who has been charmed by the fundamental questions that biology tries to give an answer to, and yet who believes in formal and engineering approaches to tackle such questions. My research interests are in the analysis, control, and verification of probabilistic and hybrid systems, and in their general application over a number of domains, particularly in systems biology.

The topic of my PhD is the development of techniques for top-down and bottom-up approaches for synthetic biology in yeast, because I'm part of the Industrial Microbiology Section the focous is on the construction and caractherization of relevant phenotypes for industry. Since, this is the first time that TUDelft's team is working with yeast, I've been helping them during my free-time.

Hi there! My research focuses on intracellular regulation, especially metabolic functions. During my master thesis I was fascinated by 13C tracer techniques that allow a quantitative insight to metabolic fluxes. It is amazing to observe how cells can adapt to their environment and even more exciting to extend their capabilities. Synthetic biology and iGEM extend to genetic and regulatory levels and I am curious how much we can learn and develop in-silico and in the lab. iGEM is fun and challenge!
Looking forward to a great Jamboree!

It's a wonderful experience to work with knowledgeable supervisors and excellent teammates, who don't use chopsticks though. The way we communicate as different roles, and the goal of completing a fantastic project I've never imagined before, really turns me on. It helps me to gain the insight to what we learned theoretically before, and hopefully our work will turn to be an amazing bio-machine. Come on guys!

This summer I am dedicated to the scientific aspect of the project. I am a master student in the Life Sciences in Delft, dedicated to our yeasties. Other than this I love to play and listen to all sorts of music, skateboard through the city and watch movies. I hope with this project to provide a useful tool to make yeast cells sniff around.

I have been an assistant professor in the Department of Bionanoscience at TU Delft since January 2011. My laboratory utilizes techniques of biochemistry and microbiology to study processes of stress response in bacteria. In particular we are currently interested in biocrystallization, a phenomenon in which bacteria condense their chromosome into a highly compacted linear array that can provide protection from damaging environmental conditions. I love the chance that iGEM offers to students to truly design and drive their own scientific project from start to finish, and I am thrilled to be an advisor to our team this year!

Dear all,
My name is Eftychia and I am the Greek girl of the team :) I came to TUDelft to do a Master in Bioinformatics. I learned about iGem competition after a mail, that I received from my master’s coordinator, Mr. Marcel Reinders.
My willingness to adapt to the culture of the Dutch University, my curiosity for further knowledge and my wonder about how my work can be combined with Biologists’ work, led to my application to iGem. Before realizing it, I was an active member of the TUDelft iGem team!!
I really enjoy working with people with different background, different habits and different ideas for the same project. By this way, I learn many things everyday and I see things from many different perspectives.  As a Bioinformatician the chance to see in practice what Synthetic Biology is about, how Biologists work and how my knowledge can contribute to their work, is really invaluable!
My main tasks in the iGem team are the development of the wiki page, sequence alignment and support to the Structural model of Snifferomyces.

Hey, after finishing chemical engineering studies in Turkey, I got my PhD on computational biology, at TUDelft and topped this with Bioinformatics post-doc. I am interested in the study of biological systems, because they exhibit emergent system properties (1+1!=2), and adapt to their environments. As for my interest in iGEM, I simply am curious and love education: very good combination for iGEM. I like to meet young minds and usually end up learning more from them than teach :)

Although I am a mathematician in my mind, I love biology and I think it is now one of the most interesting and challenging areas of application of the theory I am working on – formal verification of probabilistic systems. Moreover, working with our student team is an amazing experience which I never had before – besides of just having fun, it’s wonderful to see how the ideas, which popped up occasionally, with the time take the shape of new methods and techniques.

Ever since I realized the true complexity of every living cell, I never lost interest in it. By combining this interest with my Bachelor of Engineering, the choice for the mastertrack bionanoscience was pretty straight forward.
From the moment I read about bionanoscience, I wanted to see it all happening before my own eyes and see the results by practicing this study 'in the field'. Therefore, I see iGEM as a great opportunity to get (more) experience in modeling, labwork and teamwork within the biotechnological field. Also, iGEM is a unique possibility to boost my academic career.

Team Introduction
Hello everyone, we are NTU-Taida team. This is our first year to join the iGEM family. We begin to recruit people from medical school, and seek help from modeling expertise from electronic engineering department, and technological supports from department of biotechnology. With close supervision of our advisors, help from a group of seniors in cancer research core lab, and financial supports from National Taiwan University, we can have so much space to prove our ideas and collect loads of data. We really enjoy working as a team and combat so many obstacles along the way. Most important of all, we all firmly believe that one day we can convert biotechnological advances into practice to help treat more people or make breakthrough in basic science.

So many people graciously helped us over the course of this project and we would like to use this page to credit those individuals. These individuals were not reimbursed for their efforts, but were driven to help us out of their passion for scientific research and educational growth. First and foremost we would like to thank Lucas Argueso for his tireless effort to make our project go as smoothly as possible. Dr. Argueso was always there to answer our yeast related questions and otherwise. He never once complained no matter how often we were in his lab, how many times we emailed him, or how many times we dropped by his office to ask a ""quick"" question. Dr. Argueso, we cannot thank you enough for your input and wisdom on our project and we know we could not have made it this far without you.
The next person we would like to thank is Dr. Brian Geiss. Dr. Geiss was incredibly helpful with so many aspects of our project, including assay design, running gels, lab equipment use, and overall project direction. Dr. Geiss had answers to questions we hadn't asked yet and they never came too soon. He generously allowed us to use various components of his lab, even when he was out of town. He was patient in explaining various assays and procedures, and even suggested several methods for collecting and analyzing data. Dr. Geiss' guidance and expertise are a major contribution to this project that will not soon be forgotten.
A host of other people contributed to this project in one way or another. Whether it was through a donation of lab supplies or a sit down meeting with an expert in our desired field, all of these people made a difference in our success, even if they did not realize it. We would like to thank Dr. Jessica Prenni, ... (ADD NAMES HERE)
If we did not include your name, it is not because we did not value your input or contribution, it is because we have so many people to thank we have trouble keeping them all straight!

All work described on this wiki was done by ourselves. We managed the whole project, from planning to financing and the complete lab work by ourselves. Nevertheless we could not have done all this work without the help, advice and guidance of several people.
The wet-lab work was supervised by Erik Gullberg and Mikael Nissbeck. Erik Gullberg also showed us how to operate the flow cytometer / cell sorter (FACS), and how to do and analyze Etests.
We received biobrick plasmids and strains carrying F plasmids containing the clinical resistance genes from Erik Gullberg. We got advice and help with the modelling of RNA structures from Erik Holmqvist and Mikael Nissbeck. Hervé Nicoloff advised us on how to make large randomized libraries.
Thanks for all your help with our project!

Ehime-Japan2012 team is constructed from seven sophomore students and two instructors. The ideas, which are “E.colingual” (Miho), “E.co-domino” (Miwa) and “E.co-mail” (Miho and Miwa) were all proposed by student members. The experiments and human practice were carried out by all the members. Our wiki was designed and made by Mei and Miho. Modeling related to the degradation with Lon-tag was done by Shunsuke. Nice pictures were taken by Hikaru. Dr. Takai and Dr. Hori gave us some advices to our activities.
Contribution
The Ehime-Japan iGEM activities were in part supported by the ""Project-E"" student research support program by Ehime University.
We obtained the plasmids, pJT122, pJT118, pJT106b and pCph8 through addgene. We also got the  E.coli, JW0429 which is Δlon strain from Keio Collection via National BioResource Project E. coli (NBRP E.coli) of Japan.
Acknowledgment
・Special thanks to our teachers Dr. Takai and Dr. Hori!! They gave us a lot of supports, and we were able to enjoy iGEM competition.

Evolution of the iGEM Team Frankfurt
Our Team startet to search for a suitable project for the iGEM 2012 competition in November 2011. First we screened former iGEM Wikis for interesting but incompleted ideas. Some of us informed theirselves and presented the topics to the rest of us for an open discussion. In parallel some presented their own ideas and gave small lectures about important methods in molecular biology, since the teammembers are from different scientific disciplines. In late November the topic of stevia occurred both in the public media and in our team, because the trade and production of steviol as a sweetener was going to be legalized by the European Comission. We investigated the scientific state of knowledge about the molecular background of steviolglycoside bioynthesis and found that the genetic basis is on the one hand explored in its principles, on the other hand we noticed, that no publicated trials for a microbial production have been attempted so far. By this procedure, we ended up with three ideas (beneath the steviol subject those were the biotechnological explotation of autophagymechanisms and in vivo drug production) and finally decided to pursuit the mircobial steviol production for this years iGEM competition.
We used the christmas holidays for a more specific literature research and began to contact several groupleaders and professors at our university to inform them about the existance of our team and ask for creative and professional assistance. If this was appreciated by the groups, we presented our project in their seminars. Now the question about the practical realisation became urgent. What we needed most was laboratory space, which emerged to be even more difficult than the need of financial support. We invested a lot of our time during February and March in these two important reqirements for a participation in the competition.
Of course we also enforced the answering of scientific questions during this time. An unsolved problem was the selection of an suitable organism. We were first favouring Escherichia coli for its easy handling and the fact that some teammembers were experienced with it as well as for being the most popular ""iGEM-organism"". However we expected to face inpregnable obstacles when using a prokaryote and so decided to use Saccharomyces cerevisiae for our trials, which brought us in contact with Prof. Boles who was also willing to act as our team instructor.  With the help of Prof. Soppa, dean of studys at the faculty of biology, we were allowed to use the facilitys of the microbiological practical at the Institute of Molecular Biology for realising our idears. We gained financial support from a special subsidy fund of our university (""Qualitätssicherung der Lehre"" ~ Quality assurance of teaching) and are searching for further support from both business enterprises and scientific organisations and institutions.

Attributions and Acknowledgments
We firstly want to express our gratitude to our instructor Prof. Boles, to the dean of studies Prof. Soppa, to Prof. Fendler from the Max-Planck-Institute for Biophysics and to Prof. Manfred Schubert-Zilovics (University Vice President) for enabling the project by providing monetary and laboratory resources. We also want to thank Prof. Bettina Tudzynski for providing DNA from Gibberella fujikuroi. We thank Prof. Bode for the possebility of conducting measurements at the instruments of his group.
We thank Christina Wagner from the Presidium for the inestimable help with our financial administration which she did  complimentary in addition to her ordinary administration. The Team from Darmstadt did some trials with homologous  structure alignment of some of our enzymes for modeling their structure, we are thankful for that too.
We adress special owing to our funders, the QSL Comission and the Oswald Foundation. We thank the students councils of the biochemical and the physical institutes for their support in the filing of application for the financial support.
Last but not least we want to thank all those students who were for different reasons not able to stick to our team untill the jamboree but nevertheless did crucial work in the foundation of our team and our project. We also are grateful for the possebilities of presenting our project to research groups. Vicegeral I like to mention Prof. Ludwig and Prof. Schwalbe from the department of chemistry and biochemistry.

The team did most of the fundraising work, creating a sponsoring file, contacting potential sponsors and presenting the project. We managed the money ourselves, through Genopole and through a ""1901 law"" association. Genopole supported our project, paying inscription and jamboree participation fees, as well as donating 5000 euros towards the project. Evry university contributed 7200 euros. Sanofi donated 15 000 euros, and the French embassy in the United States donated 1500 euros. Our other sponsors helped us by providing discounts or free samples.
Many people at iSSB helped us securing funding and manage the team, notably Jean-Loup Faulon with the Sanofi funding, Dominique Zeliszewski with the sponsoring file preparation and team organisation, Joan Hérisson with setting up the lab, Maelle Cochennec who managed the money we kept at Genopole. Our work would also not have been possible without the help of Sylvie Bobelet and Bernadette Lauret, who solved so many problems the team encountered over the summer. Our supervisor Thomas Landrain was very important to the success of the team, as he brought several important members to the team, he advised us with Nicolas Pollet a lot on the strategic design of our scientific project and helped organizing the human practices in coordination with La Paillasse. Our supervisor Alfonso Jaramillo encouraged us to launch the team and opened his lab to the team.
Cloning
All cloning work was done by the team in Institute of Systems & Synthetic Biology , Evry. Supervisors Thomas Landrain and Andrew Tolonen gave advice on cloning strategy throughout the project.
Animal work
Adult frogs are kept in the animal house shared between the Metamorphosys team of iSSB and Watchfrog (a company). The adult frogs were handled by Aurore Thelie from Nicolas Pollet's team (for HCG injection, egg and sperm recovery).  For the auxin toxicity tests, auxin penetration experiments and the E. coli to Xenopus communication devices, the fertilised eggs were provided by the Metamophosys team of the iSSB.   For all tests of biobricks in Xenopus , the team was provided with unfertilised eggs and sperm, and in vitro fertilisation and DNA injection were done by team members under the supervision of Nicolas Pollet. Eggs were sorted and kept and analysed by the team, in the Metamorphosys labs.
Microscopy
Most microscopy photos were taken in the Metamorphosys labs by the team, with the help and supervision of Nicolas Pollet, Aurore Thélie and Léna Vouillot (Postdoc and PhD student in Metamorphosys team).  We would like to thank Dr. Daniel Stockholm and Genethon for letting us use LSM 510 META Laser Scanning Microscope from Zeiss, which was used with his help and that of Nicolas Pollet and Aurore Thélie for high definition fluorescence images.
HPLC
Many thanks to Damien Baud (Genoscope, Evry), who run our samples on HPLC, and to our advisor Anna who helped us analyse the spectra.
Mass spectrometry
Our advisor Anna Mlynarczyk ran our samples on LTQ-Orbitrap-XL Mass spectrometer in the LAMBE laboratory (Evry University). Thank you to Veronique Legros for advising and help using it.
T-shirt graphics
Thank you to Olivier Marquet- little brother of our Philosopher Clement- for drawing pictures of Xenopus which were printed in our t-shirts. They are really cool!

Lab team
Tristan Cerisy
Master 2, mSSB, Evry university
I did my bachelor at Evry’s University, in Bioinformatics. During that year when Jean-loup Faulon presented iGem and synthetic biology, I found it very interesting. I wanted to participate with iGem from my bachelor. Because no team existed yet close to our university, William and I decided to create this team in November and we looked for interested people, funding and projects. I am very excited to be involved in this project with this wonderful team.
Jorgelindo Da Veiga Moreira
Master 1, AIV, Diderot University
I’m a bachelor graduated student from a Parisian engineering school. I look forward to a Master degree in biotechnology. I discovered synthetic biology mainly through conferences and I’ve been immediately fascinated by this new biological approach to work on living systems. iGEM is a good opportunity for me to start in this field and to acquire experience for my future engineering carrier.
Carolina Gallo Lopez
Master 2, mSSB, Evry university
Having acquired a background in biology and a first year of master in “Genomics, Cells, Development and Evolution” at the University of Paris Sud 11, I started to be interested in systems biology since my last year of bachelor and decided on getting involved in this approach during both my second year of master and my master’s thesis. I am participating in the iGEM competition as it allows me to combine experimental work with theoretical modelling. I am keen to learn not only different biological techniques and modeling approaches but also to learn from my teammates and other iGEM teams.
Tiffany Souterre
5th year, Sup'Biotech Paris
After a BTS in Biotechnology, I went to Sup'Biotech, an engineering school in Biotechnology. For 6 years, I have been studying DNA manipulation, bacteria transformation... but it is only recently that I have heard about Synthetic Biology. It is such a promising and interesting field but requires multidisciplinary skills. I am eager to increase my knowledge to be able to work at the interface of biology and computer science. I discovered iGEM thanks to the 2009 Sup'Biotech team and I have no doubt it will be a great opportunity to learn more, gain experience and hopefully bring a modest contribution to Synthetic Biology.
William Rostain
Master 2, mSSB, Evry university
I did my bachelor in Edinburgh university, and came into contact with synthetic biology when I participated iGem with the 2010 Edinburgh team. My background is mostly molecular microbiology and biotechnology, but during iGEM I came into contact with modelling and how it could serve biology, thanks to the great modellers in our team. I decided to participate in mSSB in order to learn some more about modelling and programming so I could work more closely with computer people later :)
Cyrille Pauthenier
Student of the Ecole Normale Supérieure and member of mSSB
I participated in the 2011 iGEM Paris-Bettencourt team who was a finalist and won the prize for best presentation at the European semi-final, and then sweet sixteen at the MIT. I've studied this year in the mSSB master, I'm now about to start a PhD in metabolic engineering at Jean-Loup Faulon's laboratory at iSSB.
Karine Chauris
5th year, Sup'Biotech Paris
I’m currently in my final year at Sup'Biotech Paris, a school of biotechnology, and my professional aim is to work on bioproduction processes. I’ve been attracted, since I was young, by all the possibilities of DNA manipulation and discovered synthetic biology with the first synthetic bacteria. Why did I join iGEM? It's a unique chance to participate in a challenging and concrete project.
Joachim Eeckhout
4th year, Sup'Biotech Paris
I'm in my fourth year at Sup'Biotech, an engeenering school in biotechnologies. Like many others, I have been amazed by the controversy surrounding the publication of Craig Venter and his synthetic bacterium ""Synthia"". Since then, I am very interested to acquire expertise in this field and the iGEM competition is a chance for me to be part of this new science.
Raphael Ferreira
1st year, AIV
I've currently finished my license (Bachelor) in biotechnology and I'm about to join the AIV (Interdisciplinary approaches to life science) Masters. I discovered synthetic biology with the Craig Venter's paper (released in may 2010). After that, my school gave me a 5 month research & information processing project on synthetic biology. Through this project I've discovered the iGEM competition and the opportunities surrounding the emergence of this science filed. Enrolling in an iGEM team will give me a sight of how synthetic biology experimentations are, and also, to work with people who are interested in this science too.
Pierre Yves Nogue
2nd year Biology degree, Versaille Saint-Quentin University
Biologist student in Paris university, I've discovered the synthetic biology when I've joined ""La Paillasse"", a biohackspace in Paris. In the same time, I've learned about the existence of the Igem competition, and decided to join the Evry team after some meetings. Indeed, iGEM looks for me as a very good opportunity to work on really interesting subjects in an encouraging work atmosphere, and I've found all this advantages in the Evry team!
Hafez El-Sayyed
Master 2, mSSB, Evry university
I did my bachelor's degree and my first Master year In Beirut Arab University, Lebanon, In Biochemistry and Molecular Biology. I came across the term synthetic Biology on the mSSB Website and then started doing some research about the Synthetic Biology topic. Now I want to be part of this wave of unorthodox and ingenious attempts to help create better things around us. I COULDN'T BE Prouder  to be part of IGEM EVRY 2012.
Modeling team
Artémis Llamosi
3rd year, Ecole Centrale Paris
After completing a Master in engineering at École Centrale Paris and a research master in applied mathematics for biology at Paris 6 University, I am to start a PhD thesis on real-time control of biological systems on microfluidics chips. For many years interested in the relation between maths and biology, I discovered synthetic biology in 2011 through its connection to systems biology and immediately got ""infected"". My expertise being mostly on theoretical aspects, I enrolled in iGEM to get closer to the wetlab and apply my scholar knowledge to real life problems.
Pierre Parutto
5th year, Epita
I am curently in 5th year at the engineering school Epita and specialized in scientific computations. I am interested in biology since high school and more especially in the links between biological systems and my speciality: computer science. After all a cell can be seen as a kind of computer, as seen in the name ""genetic code"". I learned about the IGEM comptetition when I discovered the synthetic biology field in an article in Nature a few years ago. Since then I wanted to participate to the comptetition but never had the opportunity. I bring to the team my programming and engineering skills and hope to learn a lot from biologist in the lab.
Iryna Nikolayeva
2nd year, Telecom Sud Paris
As specialization of my last year in the engineering school Telecom SudParis, I will be doing the mSSB (master in systemic and synthetic biology). I've got useful computer science and maths skills for modeling and making the wiki. I imagine that mixing technologies and life science can lead to exciting inventions and discoveries. The iGEM seemed to me a nice opportunity to get to know the synthetic biology background and interact with students that are interested in it!
Mohamed Machat
Master 2, mSSB, Evry university
I am a civil engineer from Tunisia. My penchant for genetics has started since my first biology lectures in college. However, the first opportunity that I got to go into this field showed up in 2011, when I was admissible to join the ISSB master program. So I left my engineer job and have moved to France. The adventure of iGem looks to me a good step towards my career ambition: invest my mathematics and mechanics background into oncology!!
Human practice
Clément Marquet
Master 2, Philosophy, Paris I Pantheon-Sorbonne University
I'm completing a master of philosophy of science at Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne University. I discovered synthetic biology about two years ago in a popular scientific review and was struck by the ambition of the field and the diversity of disciplines involved in it. I was seduced by the special place that laboratories such as Synberc give to social sciences and started thinking about some epistemological questions that could be raised by Feynman’s word on knowing and making or by the convergence of biology and technology. I saw in the iGEM contest an opportunity to discover scientific work from the inside and to experiment how philosophical reflections could get practical and debated inside a scientific group.
Chassis
Function: Mascott
Hey I just met you! I am chassis, Team Evry's famous mascott! I kind of enjoy synthetic biology since I heard I could serve science and represent Xenopus tropicalis tough condition! In my lost moments I really enjoy French wine, maybe we'll share a bottle or two! See you in Boston! Feel free to contact me on facebook!

Team:Evry/TeamSlovenia collaboration
From 2012.igem.org
Characterization of parts from Team Slovenia 2012
To test our chassis we decided to do a collaboration with a team working in vertebrate cells. After the Regional Jamboree, and the presentation of Team Slovenia during the final, we asked them to test one of their construction. Especially constructions using TAL activator constructs (basement of their switch system).
So they send us part BBa_K782029 in the eukaryotic plasmid pCDNA3, and part BBa_K782065 in the eukaryotic plasmid pGL4.16.
The first plasmid possesses the part BBa_K782065 which contains the TAL A effector and the VP16 core under the control of the constitutive CMV promoter
The second plasmid possesses the part BBa_K782029 which contains 10 binding sites for TALA followed by the minimal promoter and the mCitrine reporter.
The TAL A system in Xenopus embryos
To test this system we first injected embryos with the plasmid BBa_K782029 which will express few mCitrine. In a second hand both plasmids, BBa_K782029 and BBa_K782065 were co-injected. The TALA VP16 expressed with the CMV promoter bind the 10x[A] sequence of the second plasmid and over-express mCitrine.
We injected plasmids with rhodamine to be sure that embryos were injected. The result show that with only the plasmid with the reporter under the minimal promoter, mCitrine is not expressed. But with the co-injection of this plasmid and the plasmid with TALA-VP16 under the control of the CMV promoter, mCitrine is expressed. It means that the switch works and the TALA-VP16 trigger the expression of mCitrie when TALA-VP16 bind the recognition site for TALA in the plasmid with mCitrine. The mCitrine were still expressed 3 days after injection, and tadpoles were developing.  Details of this system is visible here (Team Slovenia page).

CHO, Byung-Kwan, Ph.D. Professor Principal Investigator bcho@kaist.ac.kr
I am an instructor of the KAIST iGEM team. Currently, I am a principal investigator of the systems and synthetic biology laboratory at KAIST Biological Sciences. Prior to holding a faculty position with the talented colleagues at the KAIST, I have been a research scientist of the department of bioengineering at the University of California San Diego. I earned my Ph.D. from the Seoul National University on the Bioengineering and Bioinformatics in 2003.
My research has been mainly focused on the microbial systems and synthetic biology and its applications to the production of the value-added bioproducts. Happy iGEM!

JEONG, Hyewon (Mandy) - TEAM LEADER - Undergraduate student jhw162@kaist.ac.kr
Hi! I’m 3rd year undergraduate student in Biological sciences department of KAIST. I’m also now undergraduate research student in Systems biology lab and team leader of team KAIST Korea. I first suggested to start this competition to other students and recruited 7 students to make this amazing team. My research interest is focused on synthetic biology and systems biology. KAIST 2012 iGEM team’s research topic is focused on these two topics.
Reconstruction of reductive anaerobic CO2 fixation pathway in Escherichia coli and modeling this system using program.
Building switching modules which can be used to control metabolic pathway.
CHUN, Jihwan Undergraduate student casque09@kaist.ac.kr
I am a senior in the KAIST iGEM team. I study biology and especially fascinated by synthetic biology. Outside of the lab, I am a funny guy who loves to hang out and get drunk. However, what I love the most is sleeping. 
LEE, Soo-in Undergraduate student lee_sooin@kaist.ac.kr
I am an undergraduate student in KAIST. Now, I am planning to enter graduate school of the same institute. I’m interested in synthetic biology, which creates noble products through metabolic pathway engineering. Also, I am a member of the iGEM team of KAIST.

Who are we?
Petra Alkema – student Biomedical Engineering - modelling team
'Interested in modeling, longing for perfection and curious about the processes in the human body.' Hopefully these characteristics will help Petra to design the calcium model in yeast for this iGEM team. Due to her interest for computer science, she will start the master program Biomedical Engineering, BioModeling and BioInformatics in September.
Moniek de Backer – student Biomedical Engineering - lab team, funding
During her bachelor, Moniek develops her interest in extracurricular activities. Joining the iGEM team was an unique opportunity to do some exclusive research with a multidisciplinary team. She wants to develop some more lab experience and is also responsible for PR and sponsoring.
Caroline Balemans – student Mechanical Engineering - modelling team, outreach
During her minor at Biomedical Engineering, she discovered the iGEM project and decided to join the team. She made the first simplified calcium model for the project. Besides studying, she participates in different student boards and committees.
Maaike van den Boomen – student Biomedical Engineering - lab team, team leader
To keep all her interests together, Maaike has chosen for the bachelor 'Biomedical Engineering'. The unique combination of the medical, chemical, mathematical and technical subjects of this study created an almost complete picture for her. The management part is the only thing missing in this study. By taking part in a consulting board and committees this interest got also filled in.  For iGEM Eindhoven she is member of the lab team and she also manages the communication between the different sub teams.
Marijke Dermois – student Biomedical Engineering - modelling team, outreach
As she has always been interested in extracurricular activities, Marijke decided to join the Eindhoven iGEM team after a year as a board member of the Biomedical Engineering study association. Although modeling is her key interest, she will also help the team in other activities such as outreach and  general design.
Pien Koopmans – student Biomedical Engineering - lab team, funding
During her bachelor, she is trying to find out what she wants to do in her master. iGEM is a nice way to get some lab experience. It is also a nice way to work in a multidisciplinary team on a subject that is our own.
Jody Lugger – student Chemical Engineering - lab team, device team
Already studying chemistry for 10 years, he is the old guy of the team. Jody joined the iGEM team to experience what synthetic biology is all about and to further expand his multidisciplinary work experience. Because of his critical attitude and creative suggestions he has been a valuable team member throughout the various parts of the project. Although his initial interest was in the modeling part of the project, his final contributions are mainly dedicated towards the practical aspects of the lab-team. His main contributions, including to cause the occasional stir within the team, are in the device manufacturing; project goal/direction and lab work.
Christiaan Peppenster – student Biomedical Engineering - device team
Always interested in programming and websites, Christiaan decided to join to the iGEM team to get a taste of the working relationship between programmers and lab workers. He will take on the team website, test device and device software.
Jurgen Schill – student Biomedical Engineering - lab team
Considering multiple participations in projects about prokaryotic cell culture and design, Jurgen's interest evolved towards a project with eukaryotic cells. Joining the iGEM competition, using yeast, was therefore a multidisciplinary step to learn more about eukaryotic system biology. During the iGEM project, Jurgen will, not surprisingly, be part of the lab team.
Nick van der Veeken – student Biomedical Engineering - lab team
With a background in LEGO®, programming and biomedical engineering it was no surprise to find Nick joining the iGEM competition to learn more about synthetic biology. The international atmosphere of the competition also resembles his earlier volunteer work at the Board of European Students of Technology, an international network of students of engineering that organizes exchanges and summer courses on hot topics in technology.

First of all, we are all undergraduates, our supervisors gave us advice and feedback but did not perform any dry or wet work. We did receive lab instructions by Martijn van Rosmalen, who is a PhD at our university. He gave us instructions on how to work with yeast and gave valuable advice when some of the wet work did not go according to plan.
All wiki content was created by the team, only the template from Cambridge 2009 was used and altered.
The animation on the home page was created in cooperation with the ICMS Animation Studio.
The workshop we gave at the Discovery Festival was developed in cooperation with the following teams: Wageningen_UR, Amsterdam and Groningen. During several meetings we developed an outset for the workshop and eventually divided the three locations of the festival among the teams. The team of Amsterdam went to the location in Amsterdam, the teams of Wageningen and Groningen went to Rotterdam and we ended up in our hometown Eindhoven.
Our control device was created in cooperation with the Equipment & Prototype Center of the Eindhoven University of Technology. The design was made by our device team and the device was created by the before-mentioned center.
The GECO proteins were created by the group of Robert Campbell who kindly gave us permission to create BioBricksTM of these proteins.
The MID1/CCH1 sequence containing vectors were provided by Hidetoshi Iida.

Joe Alexander is a senior biochemistry major with his sights set on medical school. His portion of the project was to work on the expression plasmid and proof of concept through the use of red fluorescent protein. Joe loves gaming, snowboarding, and hanging out with friends.
Chris Clifford is a senior biochemistry major at the University of Nevada Reno. His future plans include graduating in the spring of 2013 and attending medical school. Chris is on the thiamine binding protein team where he works with his lab partner Jeremiah Pavelka to produce a thiamine-binding protein attached to a starch binding-protein to bind to rice. His other interests include, playing for the UNR Orchestra, staying physically active, and participating in clubs and organizations at UNR.
Justin Emlen is a senior at UNR studying biology and biochemistry. He is originally from Vacaville, California, which is halfway between San Francisco and Sacramento. Aside from school, Justin is very active in sports playing basketball and golf as much as possible and is a devout Los Angeles Lakers and Dodgers fan. Justin worked on the vitamin B12-binding protein portion of Nevada’s iGEM project and hopes to continue working with such ideas in the future.
Jasmine Jiang is a junior at the University of Nevada double majoring in biochemistry and philosophy who hopes to one day get a Ph.D. (or two) and actually get paid for doing cool research projects like iGEM. In addition to her work on the RFP portion of the project, Jasmine has been working very hard on everything design-related, such as the website, posters, and T-shirts. Jasmine is also a proud corgi owner, a horror movie enthusiast, and a pretty good cook if she says so herself.
Michelle Ngo is a senior at the University of Nevada, Reno majoring in Biochemistry and Nutrition hoping to pursue a career in Pharmacy one day. She is a happy biochemist who loves the beach, music, palm trees, snowflakes, and big urban cities. Michelle loves educated discussions and hanging out with the plasmids, genes, and microbes. Her ultimate goal for this project is to bind lysine-rich protein to starch-binding protein in rice to form an iRICE complex with her team. Michelle loves eating rice and can't wait to try iRICE! Mmm!
Dafne Ordonez is a biochemistry major third year undergraduate student at the University of Nevada Reno. She is from Genoa Nevada, a town of only two hundred people. Dafne worked with Justin on the thiamine-binding protein and generally helped out everyone in the lab. She loves to play with her standard poodle and eat Thai food.
Jeremiah Pavelka is a senior at University of Nevada Reno majoring in biochemistry and minoring in philosophy. A Veteran of the United States Army, he is now pursuing a career in medicine. He enjoys research and in the future would like to do his own on gene therapy. On iGEM, he worked on the thiamine-binding protein. Jeremiah works part time, volunteers at a local hospital, and serves as president of his school’s chapter of the National Society of Leadership and Success. He enjoys scuba diving, rappelling, and snowboarding when the time permits.
Cody Sarcinella is a sophomore currently studying biochemistry at the University of Nevada Reno. Cody participates in the team by assisting in various project tasks as necessary such as mini preparations and various other objectives, and also by creates buffers, agarose gels, antibiotic stocks, and LB plates. Cody came to the iGEM team to learn as much as possible. Cody's hobbies outside of iGEM include reading, hiking, riding dirt bikes, and practicing archery.
Ronald Truong is a senior this year in biochemistry and molecular biology at the University of Nevada. He hopes to one day become a physician scientist and to work with underprivileged kids in the future. As a former Team Nevada iGEMer from 2011, Ronald contributes to Team Nevada by helping organize little task so his iGEMers can focus on research. Ronald spends his nonexistent free time kayaking Lake Tahoe, playing Big 2, and eating all the of sugary goodies he can find.
Dr. Christie Howard has been a faculty member at University of Nevada, Reno of 14 years. This is her fourth time participating in Nevada iGEM and she is always impressed by her students’ motivation and energy.

From 2012.igem.org
HOME | PROJECT | TEAM | OFFICIAL TEAM PAGE | PARTS | RESULTS | NOTEBOOK | SAFETY | HUMAN PRACTICE | ATTRIBUTIONS
All experiments were performed by the students. None of the advisors performed any experiments but they did explain and guide us through the experiments we were unfamiliar with. All parts were created and submitted by the undergraduates of Team Nevada iGEM. Dr. Tang and Dr. Howard helped a lot with troubleshooting and guiding the students in figuring out how to fix any problems that arose. They did not give us the answer to solving a problem but helped us figure out an answer to solving our own problems. Dr. Shintani kindly sat in on some of our meetings and provided additional direction.
Information regarding genetically modified rice was all provided by plant manager George Graham of Calrose rice. Information regarding regulations of genetically modified rice and information about the milling/processing of rice were also provided by George. He also gave us feedback regarding our iRICE. Other people that helped are Olivia John who helped by preparing stock solutions and reagents. Dr. Patricia Ellison helped by providing us with the best method to express our starch binding proteins. Dr. Alexander Van der Linden and Dr. Jeff Harper provided a fluorescent microscopes that helped with imaging of the construct model. We also would like to acknowledge the Associated Students of University of Nevada and Charles River in helping fund a major portion our trip to the iGEM Regional Jamboree. A big thanks goes out to NEVADA INBRE for annually helping fund our research and our trip to Stanford, CA for the America West Jamboree and the World Championship Jamboree in Cambridge, MA. Lastly, a big shout out to our advisors: Dr. Howard, Dr. Shintani, and Dr. Tang. Without them, none of this would have ever been possible and we are forever grateful that they have given us this opportunity.

Ernst Bank
Name: Ernst Bank
Study: Msc. Biomolecular Siences, VU Amsterdam
iGEM job: Knowledge master, wiki design, graphical designer, software guru
About: Jack of all trades, put him behind a computer to ‘make it fly’ put him in the lab and it will also fly followed by alot of crashing and burning (better in theory than in practice). Next to studying Biomolecular Siences (1e year) also interested in computers, programming, physics,  graphical design and not to be seen as a total nerd also likes swimming, biking and partying :P.
Motivation for iGEM: Opportunity to do an ambitions project in a much shorter time span than a normal internship, also the chance to work on improving synthetic biology and the prospect of increasing teamwork skills  by working in an interdisciplinary team.
Future perspectives: Hopes to work in a social setting on ambitious bioinformatics projects where team effort is paramount to success.
Glenn Groenewegen
Name: Glenn Groenewegen
Study: Biomolecular Sciences, VU
iGEM job: Chief of Laboratorial Relations and Experiments
About: First years master student with a focus on cell biology. Besides studying very much into music and producing his own. Otherwise sports and cooking belong to his interests.
Motivation for iGEM: Wants to grab the chance on creating something real for himself and actually realizing this on the boundary of science.
Future perspectives: Sees himself working with companies on equally innovative projects.
Maarten Reijnders
Name: Maarten Reijnders
Study: MSc Bioinformatics, VU University Amsterdam
iGEM job: Wiki Chief Editor, software guru, poster/presentation manager
About yourself: BSc Bioinformatician and currently doing a Masters in the same subject, with the focus on the Artificial Intelligence side. Can be characterized as a nerd. Likes to visit concerts and music festivals and is also interested in (watching) sports.
Motivation for iGEM: iGEM is the perfect preparation for a career in science. Doing a normal internship requires you to help in a PhD students project, or at best have your own sub-project inside an existing project. Doing iGEM as a replacement for your internship gives the added bonus of having to think about every stage of a project, from brainstorming to eventually getting results, and of course human outreach. As a Bioinformatician it is also very important to be able to adapt to biologists in a project environment, for which iGEM is a perfect learning ground.
Future perspectives: After iGEM i will do something completely different, starting my internship in Wageningen where i will study protein homology using machine learning techniques. The plan is to start my PhD after my study, but direction and place is still unknown.
Maarten Slagter
Name: Maarten Slagter
Study: MSc Systems Biology & Bioinformatics
iGEM job: Modeling master
About yourself: With 15 minutes to go until the Wiki freeze, Maarten is living on the edge. Dreams of integrating biological technologies into everyday life and deeply believes in the potential of in silico techniques. Enjoy sports (rowing,  biking, running), and is fascinated by musical harmony and all who study it.
Motivation for iGEM: Got excited about the idea of thinking about biological engineering and having the Parts Registry readily available to be able to construct virtually anything. Turns out modifying an E.coli is not as straight-forward as programming a computer due to all these weird side-effects that come with the inter-dependencies between all biochemical networks! Fortunately all modelling theory and software is easily accessible and I’m learning a lot of microbiology and mathematics as we go.
Future perspectives: Researching cell signalling either in collaboration with experimentalists or in a more fundamental environment
Matias Mendeville
Name: Matias Mendeville
Study: Msc Bioinformatics/Systems Biology
iGEM job: iGEM Amsterdam 2012 CEO, funding, human outreach and practices, public relations About yourself: Born in Amsterdam, son of musicians, since a kid a lot into football. At the moment spending most of his time on investigating the complex and beautiful world of biology.
Motivation for iGEM: The right kind of project to experience science from a new perspective, compared to the usual academic way of reading books and attending lectures. Likes the challenge of working in a team.
Future perspectives: Will work on a bioinformatics internship after iGEM. Will follow developments in biotechnology and will consider different job-opportunities or doing a PhD. Curious on where he will find himself in 5 years. Perhaps coaching a football team =)
Tania Quirin
Name: Marie Ann Christine Tania Quirin
Study: MSc Biomolecular Science (2nd Year)
iGEM job: Safety manager, lab guru
About yourself: Easy-going personality, enjoys all types of discoveries through travelling. Oh and, haven’t you heard about my parties?!?
Motivation for iGEM: I like the concept of iGEM because it delves into other aspects of the scientific society. It differs tremendously from a ‘traditional’ internship in terms of societal impact and also include equally important activities such as the human outreach and funding. Hence, it develops the personality, enhances knowledge and creates a useful list of contacts for a future career. Nonetheless, my main contribution to our iGEM 2012 Amsterdam team........being one of  the two “lab heroes” :)
Future perspectives: Would like to pursue a PhD in Virology.

Name: Maarten Slagter
Study: MSc Systems Biology & Bioinformatics
iGEM job: Modeling master
About yourself: Broadly interested guy, enjoys all the usual stuff: sports (rowing,  biking, running), reading, tasty food, some partying, watching series etc. Fascinated by the effects of music on people and effective harmony, studied at a Jazz-conservatory for a year.
Motivation for iGEM: Got excited about the idea of thinking about biological engineering and having the Parts Registry readily available to be able to construct virtually anything. Turns out modifying an E.coli cell is not as straight-forward as programming a computer! But fortunately all modelling theory and software is easily accessible and I’m learning a lot of microbiology and mathematics as we go.
Future perspectives: I’d like to research cell signalling either in collaboration with experimentalists or in a more fundamentally-oriented environment.
Matias Mendeville
Name: Matias Mendeville
Study: Msc Bioinformatics/Systems Biology
iGEM job: iGEM Amsterdam 2012 CEO, funding, human outreach and practices, public relations About yourself: Born in Amsterdam, son of musicians, since a kid a lot into football. At the moment spending most of his time on investigating the complex and beautiful world of biology.
Motivation for iGEM: The right kind of project to experience science from a new perspective, compared to the usual academic way of reading books and attending lectures. Likes the challenge of working in a team.
Future perspectives: Will work on a bioinformatics internship after iGEM. Will follow developments in biotechnology and will consider different job-opportunities or doing a PhD. Curious on where he will find himself in 5 years. Perhaps coaching a football team =)
Tania Quirin
Name: Marie Ann Christine Tania Quirin
Study: MSc Biomolecular Science (2nd Year)
iGEM job: Safety manager, lab guru
About yourself: Easy-going personality, enjoys all types of discoveries through travelling. Oh and, haven’t you heard about my parties?!?
Motivation for iGEM: I like the concept of iGEM because it delves into other aspects of the scientific society. It differs tremendously from a ‘traditional’ internship in terms of societal impact and also include equally important activities such as the human outreach and funding. Hence, it develops the personality, enhances knowledge and creates a useful list of contacts for a future career. Nonetheless, my main contribution to our iGEM 2012 Amsterdam team........being one of  the two “lab heroes” :)
Future perspectives: Would like to pursue a PhD in Virology.

Secret Files Living a double life did not always come so naturally to our Inter-departmental Man of Mystery. As he reclined in his swivel chair and gazed wistfully at the dancing flame of the Bunsen burner, he thought back to his early days in Minsk. ""Damn it, Romanova,"" he mulled, ""the E1B-19kD virus was my masterwork!""
Secret Files Adam Komorowski's research interests include type V antifreeze proteins, killer T cells, adenocarcinomas, and whether martinis really taste better if shaken. He is the President and CEO of a large multinational real estate holdings company, and a well-known philanthropist. He divides his time between Toronto, Rome, and agarose gels.
Secret Files Eric Cao enjoys experimenting and secretly (not any more) wants to play around with the laboratory reagents when no one is looking. He loves hanging around with friends and listening to a variety of underground music. In the future, he hopes to go into research concerning disease cure and prevention.
Secret Files When Nicole Cyhelka is not unzipping genes with helicase, applying gibberelin to stimulate stem elongation, and studying the insertion of alpha helices in beta barrels, this chemical engineer turned synthetic biologist (read: 'mad scientist') slips into an evening gown and jets off to Monte Carlo to try her hand at a high stakes game of baccarat. They say diamonds are forever, but who ever said it was easy to get a sponsorship?
Secret Files Moustafa Abdalla is an avid gardner; primarly cultivating hyacinth, various Arabidopsis species, and his ego.  He is a prominent banker for SMERSH, and conducts regular business in Germany under the name ""Herr Ziffer"";  he is fluent in English, French, German, Italian, and Arabic.  When not entertaining CIA agents in his compound in Munich, he performs northern blots in his spare time.
Secret Files NN is one of the alleged suspects wanted in connection with the 5th July Massacre of untransformed DH5α at the infamous Petri Dish Arena. She is still around with a dreadful dose of Ampicillin. “Bullied by her existence, we will keep on forcing transformation until she gets arrested”, a colony who wished to remain anonymous, reported.
Secret Files More than anything, I try to emulate Becky Sharp from Vanity Fair. She was an uppity social climber with a ravenous appetite for wealthy men; I too am a mountaineer of sorts (though only of knowledge and books - a slightly more reliable means of 'getting ahead' in the world, I should think). The uppity part is entirely up to who you talk to.
Secret Files Abby is a self-described ""weekend warrior mechanical engineering student"" feeling out of place in the biochemistry department and loving every second of it. Her research interests include why the centrifuge tubes are so hard to remove and if it really is possible for engineering students to live a balanced life. She currently divides her time between lab work, an engineering firm – if you knew the rest we'd have to kill you.

Attributions
All wet-lab work, including cloning, characterization, and crying, was carried out by undergraduate members of the team. Undergrad iGEMers were also responsible for the modeling, planning the outreach, and making of the wiki.
Dr. Clay Fuqua
We want to especially thank Dr. Clay Fuqua of University of Illinois for providing us (finally) with working template DNA for PCRing TraR. He also provided us with a strain that churns out an immense amount of TraR specific autoinducer, and gave us a ton of information and help to make sure we were on the right track. Thank you Dr. Fuqua!
Dr. Lynne Regan
We also want to thank Dr. Lynne Regan from Yale university, who provided us with the pET11a-link-NGFP and pMRBAD-link-CGFP plasmids, which we used for all of our flouresence assays. We requested the plasmids, and they were in our lab in just a couple days. The plasmids also came with a host of information on how best to use them. Thank you Dr. Lynne Regan!
Our amazing advisors
Dr. Brian Hammer and Dr. Mark Styczynski not only kept up with the administrative red tape required to make our team possible, but provided us with support week after week. Dr. Hammer specifically helped out with the cloning troubleshooting, and Dr. Styczynski help us work out the kinks in our modeling. We couldn't have done it without you.
Dr. Patrick Bardill took on iGEM as his personal responsibility to make sure that us undergrads had all the tools we needed to succeed. Anytime we needed him he would drop everything and help us for as long as we needed.
Samit Watve not only gave invaluable counsel with regards to the ins and outs of iGEM, but he also helped us troubleshoot issues with our cloning all summer long.
Youssef Chahibi was a great resource with regards to modeling.
Special Thanks
MoNaCo
Thank you to the  NSF-funded MoNaCo (Molecular Nano-Communications Networks) project which provided additional support. Check out their site here .
Hammer Lab Members
We also want to thank Elena Antonova from the Hammer lab for providing us with pictures for the home page, and Elsa Zhao, also from the Hammer Lab, for giving moral support and advice on weekends and late at night while everyone else was gone.
Sponsors
The President's Undergraduate Research Award (PURA) Paid a stipend for three of our team members this semester, and paid for all five of our travel expenses to the regional jamboree.
The Biology and Biomedical Engineering programs at Georgia Tech paid our registration for the jamboree.
Dr. Mark Styczynski and Dr. Brian Hammer were both awarded grants specifically to help us pay for our costs.

1.3 Asking the People about Synthetic Biology
Science Meets People
German Wide Action Day
In june this year all German iGEM team met up at the third annual conference for biotechnology of the generation 2020+ organized by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research (Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung, BMBF). In context of this conference the teams developed the idea of a German wide “ACTION DAY FOR SYNTHETIC BIOLOGY” which should take place for its first time on the 25th of August this year. Each German iGEM team organized an action day in their university hometowns to launch an initiative for public dialogue about Synthetic Biology and to draw the public’s attention to this scientific field.
Day of Synthetic Biology in Potsdam's center with information booth and street lab
In Potsdam city we set up an information booth with posters in the main pedestrian area (Brandenburger Straße) and started an interesting dialogue with people of all ages who passed by and stopped over. We informed them about Synthetic Biology in general to create a common understanding of this new scientific field and to spark their interest. The advantages and possibilities of Synthetic Biology were equally subject of this dialogue as the disadvantages and potential risks that this new field possesses. People showed a great interest for the iGEM competition and its nature as scientific student competition.
As a generation-spanning initiative, we built up a mobile street lab offering DNA extraction out of bananas mainly for children who showed interest, but also for adults and often for families. We got an overwhelming positive resonance from all parents who got attracted by our scientific street experiment. Our lab was equipped with a hot water bath, ice baths, non-toxic chemicals, and grinding and filtration units and a poster describing the protocol.

Asking the People about Synthetic Biology
The second section of our SocialBrick is the part ""Science meets people"". For this SocialBrick we developed a survey to ask about people's knowledge of Synthetic Biology and their opinion on this scientific field. In the following the results of this survey will be presented.
1. Have you ever heard about the term/ the scientific field of Synthetic Biology?
a) Yes
b) I briefly heard about it.
c) No
2. Which definition would match your idea of Synthetic Biology?
a) branch of Biology that releates to the animal kingdom, espacially to the multicellular organisms
b) interdisciplinary scientific field, which solves biological problems on the basis of theoretical and computer-based modelsy
c) interdisciplinary scientific field, which aims to design biological systems with new features that did not exist in nature on the basis of standardized biobricks
d) a new microbiotical field, which deals with the optimization of yeast cultures for Dr. Oetker backing mixtures
3. How do you see your knowledge of Synthetic Biology?
a) very good
b) good
c) satisfying
d) adequate
c) fail
4. In 2010 the creation of a bacteria with an entirely synthetic (artificial) genome was completed. What do you think about this?
a) I think it is very interesting.
b) I think this developent ist potentially dangerous.
c) I do not care about this topic.
5. In which terms would you describe the Synthetic Biology most appropriately? (multiple responses allowed)
a) innovative
b) interesting
c) dangerous
d) advanced
e) useful
f) boring
g) uncontrollable
h) not relevant
i) important/essential
6. Do you think that Synthetic Biology in the long term is rather beneficially for the society or rather dangerous in terms of bioterrorism?
a) Synthetic Biology in the long term will create benefits.
b) Synthetic Biology in the long term will bring serious disadvantages.
7. Would you say that we as human overstep our competences when we genetically modify organisms and do you think that the consequences of our actions can be estimated?
a) Yes, we as human clearly overstep our competences and we are not able to truly estimate the consequences of our actions.
b) No, we as human do not overstep our competences. The possible consequences of our actions can indeed be estimated on many years of scientific experience.
c) Even though we are not able to assess all of the consequences we should support research in the field of Synthetic Biology.
8. How well or how bad informed to you feel by scientists, teachers and the specialist press about the advantages and disadvantages of Synthetic Biology?
a) I do feel well informed.
b) I do feel badly informed.
9. Do you think that the public controversy over abstaining from genetically modified organisms (GMO) in food is still tenable for the future?
a) Yes, I think that the public will still demand the waiver of GMOs in food.
b) No, I do not think that we can further maintain the rejection of GMOs in food.
10. Have we inspired your curiosity by asking all these questions about Synthetic Biology and will you further inform yourself about this topic?
a) Yes
b) Maybe
c) No
Summary
To sum up the main results of the survey, you can see that the people see the great potential of Synthetic Biology and are very interested in this new scientific field. Nevertheless, the people have to get informed about Synthetic Biology. The prejudice that most of the people dislike genetically modified organisms and, hence, Synthetic Biology can not be confirmed, although there is no clear opinion about genetically modified organisms in food.
We really liked to inform people about Synthetic Biology. The results show us that most of the people are encouraged about Synthetic Biology. But, we have to continue our information campaigns to improve knowledge and acceptance of Synthetic Biology in future.

Team Members
Muyuan Chen is a senior undergraduate from Biomedical Engineering School. As a talent in biology, he showed up his great passion even in high school when he curiously dissected almost all kinds of plants he could found on campus. After he got into Southeast University,his proficiency in programming triggers his idea to program the actual biological life and this idea eventually leads him to this competition. Believe it or not, iGem has given him such a platform that he can engineer bacteria to grow without symmetry. When someone asked him what is the meaning of this design, he meditated and smiled,’ How can we judge the achievements of a person when he is only a baby?’
Xuelong Fan, as a senior undergraduate from Biomedical Engineering School, has already achieved stable knowledge in molecular biology as well as experiment skills after 3 years of learning and training. Fan contributed a lot to the advance of the Southeast University’s premiere in iGem competition. From academy support to school support, from nothing to massive amount of research funding, he has thrown his blood and sweat on every step advance. He is mainly responsible for light induction in this project.
Xiaodan Xu is a junior undergraduate from School of Transportation. Her great interest in microbiology makes her, a ‘laywoman’, devote her heart and soul into this game. After a whole summer’s practice, she has grown from an insect to a creature in synthetic biology. No matter scheme design or experiment work, she showed her wisdom in almost every session and has made eternal mark during our whole progress. She is mainly responsible for RNAi in E.coli division control technology for flexible colony pattern.
Shen Gao is a senior undergraduate from Biomedical Engineering School. With his great passion in experiments, he cheered and hailed for the advance of this game. However, it was not long before he realized that the competition is more like research than a mere experiment and that research life is more like a butcher knife than Magic the Gathering. Even with perfect design,there still can be failure. It is, as he finally pointed out, more important to sometimes stop your step, meditate and smell the flowers rather than minipreping all day. He is mainly responsible for the construction of toggle switch to regulate gene expression.
Zhengyang Jia is a senior undergraduate from Biomedical Engineering School. Initially coming to our team for fun, however, he got improved interest in this competition after communication with other students. Although a late-comer in our team, he still found his special advantages. He has become an expert in plasmid-minipreping, in quality as well as quantity. Massive lab data is always astonishing for others rather than Jia because to him, it is just the lessons learned from large numbers of experiments that are truly charming and meaningful.
Xingyu Zhou is a junior undergraduate from School Of Information Science and Technology. Though a purely EE engineering student, he has been interested in molecular biology for many years. Zhou has been a creative student since he was in primary school and this even improves after entering university. With his brave imagination, he designed the special fiber-optic array device attached to the microscope used for light induction and he takes part in the design of the AHL system as well as blue light sensing pathway.He is also the main planner for our human practice part.
Xintong Ling, is a senior from the School of Information Science and Engineering. He spent two years in Chien-Shiung Wu College. He is fond of splendid formulas like eiπ+1=0. He loves harmonious theories such as Occam's Razor. He is crazy about outlining this world with mathematics, which involves integral the past and differential the future. In order to put his dear mathematics into the great career of interpreting the most complicated phenomena all over the world---the life, he decided to take part in our iGem team regardless of his fragile biological basis. He is responsible for math modeling work in our project, mainly simulating experimental results with cell-automata.
Kai Gui, a senior student from Mechanical Engineering, Southeast University, has fallen love with mathematics after studying nearly 10 subjects of different areas of math. In his opinion, the most obvious beauty of mathematics lies in abstractness. With the progress of profession study, he slowly feels that the manipulation of a machine is similar to that of an animal and that the combination of these two things can contribute better to humankind, just as Wiener has appointed as another name of his classical <Control Theory>: Cybernetics, or, control and communication in the animal and the machine. He has chosen bio-mechanical and electrical integration as his graduate orientation, as a consequence, this competition would be a stimulus for him to study biology. He is mainly responsible for math modeling in our project and he has created a new statistical method to evaluate the availability of a biological part.
Ying Cheng, a medical student who is adventurous in experiment and considerate in ward, often in her spare time, often goes to community and does voluntary work, such as giving diabetics some guidance about diet, exercise and right methods of dealing with hypoglycemia. She is a splendid experiment executor who can conduct experiments with great accuracy.
Le Zhou, an ambitious youth from the Art School, chooses the endless path of seeking art without hesitation. Though a purely layman for biology, she still perceives the variance as well as beauty of life. Feeling and seeking beauty is a constant theme of human art. Throughout the whole journey, she witnesses the growth to mature of our project. She is responsible for decorating the display of our project, cooperating with another beauty seeker.
Peng Cheng, an art seeker who is highly talented in what he loves, a homebody that combines art and technique, has a truly valuable sanguine mind. He by himself finished the style design and plotting of our project, which mains looking for a mutual language between biology and design and seeking the resonance between science and art, to eventually shown our project perfectly to the greatest extent.

Why iGEM?: I am so excited to be part of the iGEM team; be able to see synthetic biology from different perspectives and investigate its application to resolve such a huge environmental problem that is the Pacific Ocean Garbage Patch and least but not last a summer in the lab sounds like good fun :-)
Joanne Ting Chu En
I'm a second year Medical Physics student and my main responsibility is towards the modelling part of the project.
Why iGEM? I love the interdisciplinary nature of the iGEM project and I like seeing how different fields of science come together to achieve an aim. This also provides both a challenge and an opportunity to explore how I could apply my knowledge as a physicist in the field of SynBio. How could I not be involved?
Erin Oerton
I am a second year Computer Scientist and my key role is part of the computer modelling team.
Why iGEM?: The DNA-as-programming-language concept of synthetic biology appeals to me both as a computer scientist and as a former A-level Biology student - I think it's an area with massive potential and I can't wait to see what the future holds for for SynBio!
Philipp Boeing
I'm a second year Computer Science student. I helped recruiting the team and my main job is making sure we go as far as we can.
Why iGEM?: I'm very excited by the potential of synthetic biology and I think iGEM is a particularly great project, because it involves so many different aspects: lab work, modeling, marketing, human practice...
Carina Tran
I’m a second year Architecture student, and my key role in iGEM is relating our project to the built environment and pushing the ideas to tangible possibilities. I am also responsible for the visual communication of our project.
Why iGEM?:  In the world of architecture studies it is completely rare to be able to have access to a hands-on research method. My passion lies completely within the idea of turning waste into a resource and the potentials of iGEM seemed far too exciting to pass up.
Leonard Wen Yan Leong
I am a second year Biochemical Engineer, and my key role in iGEM is in characterisation and construction of Biobricks.
Why iGEM?: It's a great collaboration between different fields, creating something new - and oh yeah, it's extremely geeky!
Erick Ramos
I am studying an MRes in Synthetic Biology and carrying out my MRes project on genetic networks for bioprocess control at the Biochemical Engineering Department. My role as an instructor involves helping with construction of the different modules, characterisation and modelling.
Why iGEM?: I find Synthetic Biology a fascinating field of study to develop new technology for current and future problems; iGEM also represents a good opportunity to increase my knowledge and skills in the field.
Yanika Borg
I am a second year PhD student at the Biochemical Engineering and Maths department, where I carry out research in Synthetic Biology. My role within the team is as an instructor, and throughout this summer I have helped the team with aspects of modelling and experimental lab work and troubleshooting.
Why iGEM?: This project relates directly to my field of study, so it allowed me the opportunity to work in and learn more about the subject.

Our Team
The UTK-Knoxville iGEM team is composed of four undergraduate students from the University of Tennessee College of Engineering, one high school student from Powell High School, one graduate adviser, and two faculty advisers.
Undergraduate Team Members
Morgan Baltz
I am a senior in Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering with a research background in protein engineering, so for me iGEM is an opportunity to explore a new facet of chemical engineering research. After leaving UT Knoxville, I plan to obtain my PhD in Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering.
Katie Lutes
I am a senior in Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, with an Honors Biomolecular concentration and a minor in Biological Sciences. Although I am originally from Kentucky, I now call Knoxville, Tennessee home and Rocky Top will always be home sweet home to me. After graduation, I plan to pursue a PhD in Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering and continue with my love of research. I hope that iGEM will give me both technical experience and fun memories from my undergraduate career.
Genesis Minter
I’m a junior in Chemical Engineering with a Biomolecular concentration. My interest in chemistry is what initially drew me to this field, but I find the various biological applications the most engaging. (After all, the intricacies of the genetic code beat steam tables any day). To me, iGEM is a new and exciting way to connect with the scientific community on a global scale, something I see myself continuing to do as I work towards a career in research.
Akshitha Yarrabothula
Hi! My name is Akshitha Yarrabothula and I'm a Senior in Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering from Birmingham, AL. After graduation, I hope to one day attend medical school and pursue my passion of science, research, medicine, and people. Through iGEM, I hope to gain valuable experiences that will not only broaden my appreciation of research and creativity but will also prepare me for the years ahead!
High School Team Members
Brandon Wilbanks
I am a senior at Powell High School working with the UTK iGEM team through UT's Pre-Collegiate Research Scholar's Program. PCRSP has given me the great opprotunity to get involved in a field of research I'm interested in for the summer, fall, and spring semesters at UT in addition to my high school classes, allowing me not only to broaden my horizons but also to get a taste of the type of work I could be doing later down the road. I thoroughly enjoy my time in the lab and look forward to learning even more as I continue work with iGEM.

During the iGEM competition our team received a lot of help. Therefore we want to thank everybody and especially the following people.
Dr. Michael Bölker
Dr. Michael Bölker is the instructor of our iGEM team Marburg_SYNMIKRO 2012. He was the one to come up with the idea to join iGEM. This was the perfect precondition for beeing a great supervisor and motivator during the whole competition. He provided us with lab space for working on our project and a seminar room for the regular team meetings. We want to thank him for giving us the incredible chance and best conditions for becoming a part of the iGEM family.
Michaela Wehr and Britta Tillmann
Britta and Michaela are PhD students in the research group of Dr. Michael Bölker. Both helped us a lot to get around in the lab. They made us familiar with every detail and secret from 'A' like agarose gels to 'Z' like z(c)entrifuge. Moreover we want to thank them for their constant helpfulness. Furthermore, we are very thankful to Britta for spending a lot of time with us at the microscope and explaining the handling of ImageJ software. Besides her support with the microscopy she was also a great help for us in primer design.
Marisa Piscator
Marisa is the technical assistant in the research group of Dr. Michael Bölker. She helped us a lot to get around in the lab, showed us how to handle with certain lab equipments like the PCR machine and the autoclave. In addition she made us comfortable with the organisation of the laboratorium.
Christian Renicke
Christian is a PhD student in the research group of Dr. Christof Taxis. He is excellently trained in microscopy and helped us to improve visualization of fluorescent proteins in Escherichia coli.

Who we are
Dr. Rachel O'Neil
Advisors:
Rachel O'Neil:     Faculty Advisor
Dr. O'Neill's research in genomics involves several large-scale sequencing projects to map and compare large genomes – such as humans, the tammar wallaby and deer mice – and to learn more about how they function. She is particularly interested in the centromere – the part of the chromosome that is essential for cell division. The centromere has not been sequenced yet, even for humans. She calls it ""uncharted territory"" that could yield answers about human health and disease.
She is also the best faculty advisor we could have asked for.
Laura Hall:        Grad Advisor
Laura is a PhD student in genetics and genomics and is getting ready to graduate. She can't wait to find a job and move to San Diego.
Sarah Mitchell:    Grad Advisor
PhD student in Genetics and Genomics.
Brianna Flynn:     Grad Advisor
PhD student in Genetics and Genomics.
Undergrads:
Nicholas Jannetty:    'Fearless Leader' (COO)
Nick J. is a Senior studying Biomedical Engineering. He was the first student at UConn to take interest in iGEM and his hours of dedication and effort are the foundation that formed the team.
Alex Byer-Alcorace: 'Consigliere' (VP)
Alex is studying Cell and Molecular Biology at the University of Connecticut with a focus in Microbiology.
Nicholas Calistri:    'Number Cruncher'  (CFO)
Nick C. is a seventh semester Biomedical Engineering student at UConn.  He enjoys skiing, hiking, rock climbing, and camping.  This affinity for fresh air may be an attempt to compensate for spending the entire academic year indoors hunched over his laptop.
John Boak:  'Faithful Scribe'  (SEC)
John is a Senior, majoring in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at Uconn. Hobbies include Singing, reading, hiking, playing video games and writing.  Needless to say, he is a walking contradiction.
Katie Ritz:
Katie is Junior studying Molecular and Cell Biology at UConn.
Parker Sulkowski: 'Hardy Boy'
A senior majoring in MCB minoring in chemistry and looking forward to graduate school.
Kristen Hughes: 'Kiki'
Kristen Hughes is a 4th year MCB major with an interest in genetics. She has been doing research in a lab for 1.5 years and is one of the original UConn iGEM members.
Heather Jones:
Heather is a fifth semester student studying at the University of Connecticut School of Pharmacy and an active member of the UConn Women's Club Soccer Team.
Tom Bachant:
Tom is a senior studying Biomedical Engineering.  He is a well accomplished app developer who worked on the popular iOS applications 'iHusky' and 'Sobrio'.

Special Thanks
Dr. Linda Strausbaugh: Professor of Molecular and Cell Biology; Head of the Center for Applied Genetics and Technology
Dr. Strausbaugh's support has meant the world to us. She allowed us to use the CAGT facilities and gave us the money to register for iGEM. Without her belief in us we never would have made it to where we are today.
Dr. Ben Carone: University of Massachusetts - Amherst
For teaching us everything we know about yeast transformation. And for providing us with the yeast and several transformation materials
Dr. Judy Brown: Assistant Professor in Residence Co-Director, UConn Induced Pluripotent Stem Cell and Chromosome Core University of Connecticut
For helping us, especially  when we were completely lost.
What we did
We formed a team. A bunch of misfits from different majors across the university decided to come together and form UConn’s first iGEM team. We had no idea what we were doing most of the way but somehow we put it all together and UConn iGEM was born. We had some hiccups and roadblocks and stumps and detours and bamboozles and curve balls but we made it work and came out better on the other side.
For now our main goal for this year is to make sure that the next generation of iGEMers will be more prepared for the tasks and demands of the competition. (And hopefully avoid some of the pitfalls that we had this year) By next year you can expect UConn iGEM to be a force to be reckoned with at the Jamboree.

Having a lot of interactions with great teams, we were able to get a lot of good experience. Valuable experience we have gained with colleagues through iGEM is as follows.
Collaboration with UT-Tokyo software team
This year, there is another team from the University of Tokyo in the software track.  We used “Biobrick Search” which this team made when we searched biobricks. We gave feedback on our impressions and problems it had. This seemed to be beneficial for both our and the software team.
May festival
The UT-Tokyo team held a communication room in the university festival, the May Festival during May 19th and 20th, 2012. The contents are here . We cooperated with other teams in Japan (KAIT Japan, Tokyo-NoKoGen, Saitama) in organizing this communication room.  May Festival usually attracts over 10,000 people. So, this festival is a very good opportunity to get a lot of people to learn about iGEM. More people became interested in iGEM after attending our booth. Each team put up posters about their project, and explained them to people who were interested. By co-hosting the event, we think people were realized that there are various teams in the competition, with many projects. This also led to making an opportunity to strengthen collaboration between teams in Japan.
A social event with teams from Japan
On August 13, a social event was held by teams participating in 2012 iGEM from Japan. 5 teams; Tokyo Metropolitan University, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Kyoto University, University of Tokyo (software) and our team participated. Tokyo Metropolitan University hosted. Each team presented for 40 minutes about their team projects and human practices followed by questions. There were two aims for this event. First is for Japanese teams participating in iGEM 2012 to get to know each other better. Second is to get advice on our projects during the question time. In addition to being given an opportunity to practice the presentation, we were able to spend quality time with a lively question and answer session. Also, we renewed our motivation by learning other team's projects. In particular, it was fruitful that we noticed a problem about our project and got a hint of the answer to the problem by the question-and-answer session from the other teams. An appropriate and humorous piece of advice from Dr. Kiga who has been participating in iGEM for a long time was instructive. At question and answer session, we were given a memorable phrase from someone at a team; “I wanted to research about this theme, but I couldn’t. I want UT-Tokyo team to accomplish this project.” We pledged that we will carry through our project, whether his comment was true or not. We knew that one of our projects “inhibitions of transcriptional factor” is similar to “Arg box” (BBa_K649401), which is one of Tokyo Institute of Technology’s projects last year. We requested the cooperation of Tokyo Institute of Technology, and got some parts for this purpose. On the basis of these parts, we attempted to make additional tests of Arg box, to compare the results with our version, which extends upon their method.

We have produced hydrogen by fermentation.
We have demonstrated our biobrick parts contribute to hydrogen production.
We have shown possibility to improve the Biobrick system for following reasons:
We have suggested a possible alternative method of ""knockdown"" in E. coli.
We have assessed and improved existing parts, especially Arg box.
We have made a conclusion that reading is still a powerful source of information.
We have introduced more than 70 books in order to improve science literacy.
We have had a nice time communicating with various people in the May Fes!
We have enjoyed this summer!!!

name:
Nisa Purwanto
duty:
Lab Worker
bio:
Nisa is almost at the end of her Master Molecular Biology and Biotechnology in Groningen.
role:
Being one of the most experienced people in the lab, she's responsible for ordering of materials and enzymes. Apart from that, she's our super-primer designer.
special lab skill:
Nisa is one of the smallest team member in our group, literally. With that size connection, she can literally speak to the bacteria. With her power, we can accomplish this almost impossible project, because the Bacillus subtilis obey her will. Do not mess with this tiny girl, or face the wrath of the MicroWorld!!!
PS: She can grow Bacillus subtilis better than anyone else, so we 'think' she can 'talk' to them, Really.
further:
Even though her image is so mystical, she is a very lively girl with overflowing energy to work in the lab. And yes, we were forced to write this.

Renske van Raaphorst
duty:
Secretary, PR
bio:
Renske did a Bachelors in Molecular Life Sciences in at the Rijksuniversiteit Groningen, and is now doing a          Masters in Molecular Biology & Biotechnology at the RuG as well.
role:
Renske tends to stick her nose in everything. She likes doing weird experiments, like testing spoiling meat or building improvised setups. Further, she's in charge of          the education/human practice part of iGEM.
special lab skill:
Renske can work at the 37 degrees room for ages, just as Arjan. They learned to endure the heat, and the beautiful aroma of our spoiling meat experiments. She has a great heart for iGEM. She does everything for our B. subtilis, even taking showers with them in the 37 degrees room.
further:
When she's not doing stuff for iGEM, she's most likely jamming with her band Frankly no Helix or singing along with one of the famous Backstreet boys songs.

name:
Elbrich Hendriks
duty:
Team Leader
bio:
Elbrich just finished her Bachelors in Molecular Life Sciences at the Rijksuniversiteit Groningen.          Now, she'll start her Master Bio-Pharmaceutical Sciences at the University of Leiden.
role:
If you want to know her role in the iGEM Groningen 2012 team, you'd best ask what she doesn't do for iGEM.         A summary of what she already performed: labwork, fundraising, bio-art painting, giving presentations,          arranging weekly iGEM Groningen meetings and worklists, keeping track of what everybody is doing, etc.
further:
Elbrich was born in Friesland, the province next to Groningen.          There won't pass a day without her saying things in Frysian and she can spot Frysian flags from far distances.
It giet der mei de fioele yn en it moat der mei de knyptange út.

All the work for this project was performed by the iGEM Groningen 2012 team members, the lab work started from May 2012 onwards.
The original Bacillus subtilis integration vector pSac-Cm from which we derived our backbone biobrick originates from the article by Middleton et al. [1] and was provided     by Dr. Jan-Willem Veening from the Molecular Genetics group of the University of Groningen, as was the GFP optimized for Bacillus subtilis for our testing constructs, the Escherichia coli dh5a strain and the Bacillus subtilis sp. 168 strain we used in the lab.
The idea of the Food Warden was developed by the team before the labwork started. All experiments, the modeling and the    sticker design were planned and carried out by the team. Directions were given by our advisors, but they     only had a consultative function.
We were informed by Marius Uebel about GMP/SOP and data management with the use of acronyms. The team also took care of     the sponsoring and all the other organizational issues. We made our own logos, drawings and wiki/presentation/poster style.     The picture gallery on the home page and in other sections of our wiki has been made using the hoverbox image gallery code by Nathan Smith as a basis.
Last but not least, we wanted to add an extra feature to the wiki, by providing everyone with an exact copy of the iGEM server for use     on a local hard disk. Each team can immediately see the versions of all the available libraries now. Click here .

From 2012.igem.org
Born under the faint glow of the moon at the end of the winter solstice, Brian was abandoned at birth and raised by an old mother wolf, leading to his current obsession with the cool canines. A rising sophomore, Brian intends to major in biology (Pre-Med, of course) at WashU. He doesn't rely on iTunes too much, but has found that he listens to a lot of Coldplay. Currently, his number 2 song on iTunes is Paradise, by Coldplay.

Lucas Harrington
After watching Life Aquatic at the age of 7.43, Lucas convinced his parents to convert his family's swimming pool to a sanctuary for cuttlefish. However, being from St. Louis the transport of cuttlefish from the nearest ocean resulted in the death of more than 90% of the specimens.  As a result Lucas was forced to eat cuttlefish every night, leading to its becoming his favorite food.   Now a Senior majoring in biochemistry, raising cuttlefish has transitioned to being his #2 hobby.

He was born and raised in the great city of St. Louis, Missouri. He is a rising Junior majoring in Biomedical Engineering. He runs cross country and distance in indoor and outdoor track and field for Wash U. Enchanted by Taylor Swift tops his most played on iTunes. His favorite recent TV series has been Hatfields & McCoys on the History Channel. He says the best food in the world is his mom’s banana bread. His favorite color is sky blue, and most importantly, his second favorite hobby is hiking.
He chose the dolphin as his animal after being inspired by the hydroplaning dolphins found in this video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6yzpe8r4xg .

Andrew Ng
Andrew Ng is a sophomore majoring in Biomedical Engineering from San Diego, California. His favorite food is the California Burrito, which is a San Diegan delicacy consisting of carne asada, guacamole, cheese, and most importantly French Fries, all wrapped in a warm tortilla. He chose the manatee as his favorite animal because he too dreams of conquering the world one day, and plans to use our saffron producing bug to achieve his goal. As a soundtrack to the conquest, he plans to play Wagner’s “Ride of the Valkyries”. When he is not using iGEM to further his aspirations for world domination, he enjoys playing water polo for Washington University.

Team
The third-ever Washington University in St. Louis iGEM team is composed of four undergraduate students majoring in biology, biochemistry and biomedical engineering. With the help of two mentors, Dr. Joe Jez and Dr. Gautam Dantas, and several graduate students (Brian Landry, Bert Berla, and Larry Page), the team developed and carried out a project of its own devising – namely, the synthesis of the components of saffron in the vector Synechocystis.   This year’s team was assembled at the beginning of the spring semester.  Through weekly Wednesday morning meetings, the team brainstormed ideas with the mentors, eventually forming a concrete plan to be implemented over the summer. With most of the planning done during the semester, the team was free to spend the summer first ironing out the finer details of the project and then implementing the project.

Lucas Harrington
After watching Life Aquatic at the age of 7.43, Lucas convinced his parents to convert his family's swimming pool to a sanctuary for cuttlefish. However, being from St. Louis the transport of cuttlefish from the nearest ocean resulted in the death of more than 90% of the specimens.  As a result Lucas was forced to eat cuttlefish every night, leading to its becoming his favorite food.   Now a Senior majoring in biochemistry, raising cuttlefish has transitioned to being his #2 hobby.

Project Support
Dr. Gautam Dantas and Dr. Joseph Jez served as mentors during our iGEM project duration. They had weekly meeting with us and helped us troubleshoot any ideas that we had. Dr. Jez also lent us lab supplies. Jonathan Hermann acted as the student advisor. He headed the weekly meetings in the early stages of the project and gave us advice on our project ideas. Bert Berla, Larry Page, and Brian Landry guided us both before the project began by helping us brainstorm ideas and afterwards by sharing their knowledge on our model organism Synechocystis PCC 6803.
Modeling Support
Dr. Yinjie Tang and his graduate student Arul Varman guided us on the creation of our model. They had a big hand in teaching us how to begin our model and were always there when we came across stumbling blocks.
General Support
Washington University Biology Department provided us with a workspace, the Biology Teaching Lab. Carol Kohring went over safety guidelines with us and showed us how to use the autoclave.
Financial­­­ & Lab Facilities
iGEM would like to thank Sigma-Aldrich and New England BioLabs Inc for lab supplies, Washington University for stipends, Washington University School of Engineering and Monsanto for financial support and DNA 2.0 for materializing our construct design.

Except for the fundamental parts provided  by iGEM, the ideas, designs and experiments were purely original and carried  out by ourselves.
The contribution of host labs mainly  focused on providing us a platform to turn our ideas into reality, with  financial and material support. During the experiment procedure, our advisors  and instructors gave comments and suggestions on the designs, and also helped  us with some detailed experiment tips.
Each member of the Tsinghua iGEM 2012 team  contributed a lot to the whole project, listed as followed:
ZHAO Yu, SUN Yingyuan, SHEN Zhixun, LI  Linxin et al worked hard on the general idea and designs of this project; SUN  Yingyuan, LI Linxin, SHEN Zhixun, SHAO Wen, FAN Yujie, ZHU Mingyuan, LI  Jingyang et al were mainly engaged in experiments; LI Linxin, SHEN Zhixun et al  for establishing the model; ZHAO Yu, SHAO Wen, KANG Shiteng, LI Shenrui et al for  the biosafety part; SHI Xiao, SHI Xiaojing, DAI Chen, ZHAO Yanyan et al contributed  most to human practice and backup for the team; ZHU Meng, ZHANG Xingjian, LI  Jingyang, LI Shenrui, GUO Zehua, KANG Shiteng, SHAO Wen et al for the designs  of wiki, poster, booklet and etc. LIU Yu, GUO Zehua, ZHANG Xingjian et al for the programming of wiki and  websites.

About University
HIT
    Harbin Institute of Technology (HIT) was founded in 1920, initially known as Harbin Sino-Russian School for Industry. HIT sets a very high standard in education.  As a prestigious institution in China, HIT is known for its achievements in science and engineering areas for several decades. A 2009 analysis of research citations by Thomson Reuters Essential Science Indicators found HIT among the top 1% of institutions in the fields of Material Science, Chemistry, Engineering and Physics, and No.9 in the number of theses published in the area of Material Science worldwide. HIT has a high-level research faculty of over 2900 full-time teaching and research faculty, including 22 academicians of the Chinese Academy of Science and the Chinese Academy of Engineering. In recent years, the faculty and students have made great contribution to the development of the Chinese aerospace, especially the success of Shenzhou series spacecraft. In April 2004, the ""Experimental Satellite No.1"" was launched successfully, which was the first applicable small satellite developed by a Chinese university. Taking talent cultivation as a task, HIT will draw on its heritage of excellence and make full use of its comprehensive advantages to mold itself into world-class universities and contribute to the prosperity of the nation.

ABOUT SAFETY
1.Would any of your parts or project ideas raise safety issues?
A. Risks to the safety and health of team members or others in the lab?
B. Risks to the safety and health of the general public if released by design or accident?
C. Risks to environmental quality if released by design or accident?
D. Risks to security through malicious misuse by individuals, groups or states?
No, our project didn't raise any safety issues. All the parts, bacteria (E. coli) and instruments that we use in our lab are harmless to humans and the environment under normal conditions. Once we finished our experiment, all wares we used would be sterilized in high temperature, then we discard waste in waste bins designated for our iGEM lab, and we would wear gloves when we washed wares.
2.Do any of the new BioBrick parts (or devices) that you made this year raise any safety issues?
None of the new BioBrick parts we made this year would raise any safety issue according to our current profession context.
3.Is there a local biosafety group, committee, or review board at your institution? If yes, what does your local biosafety group think about your project? If no, which specific biosafety rules or guidelines do you have to consider in your country?
A  Does your institution have its own biosafety rules?
B. Does your institution have an Institutional Biosafety Committee? Have you discussed your project with them?
C. Did you receive any biosafety and/or lab training before beginning your project?
D. Does your country have national biosafety regulations or guidelines?
Yes. Both our institution and the state government have committees that establish guidelines and policies on biosafety. Evaluation of biosafety in research laboratories are regularly carried out, including evaluation of research proposals that may determine whether grants are given, as well as monitoring of experimental procedures in the laboratories to ensure that they meet the standards of biosafety.
To learn more about PR China's administrations and regulations concerning biosafety, please click the following links:
National Biosafety Office, Ministry of Environmental Protection, PR China
This website lists policies, regulations and contracts on ensuring safe research in biology and publishes latest domestic and international news on biosafety.
Biosafety regulation on pathogenic microbes, PR China
This webpage declares rules and policies established by the State Department that regulates laboratory management regarding pathogenic microbes, including classification of pathogenic microbes, respective treatments and control of laboratory infection.
4.Do you have any other ideas how to deal with safety issues that could be useful for future iGEM competitions? How could parts, devices and systems be made even safer through biosafety engineering?
The collaboration and experience sharing among teams is important. Also, workshops held in each year could invite professors specialized in bio-security to introduce the latest technologies and developments on securities issues.
We think of three useful steps as following to make parts, devices and systems even safer: Firstly, every lab should have strict disciplines. Secondly, parts, devices or systems should be added with a label, such as fluorescent label, so that we can easily track them. Thirdly, suicide system should be applied into engineered bacteria, and so engineered bacteria would kill themselves once they are out of control.

Team presentation
iGEM Copenhagen2012 is the second team to participate in iGEM. The team is divided into those who work in the laboratory and the external members that work with the project from different fields of study. The team was started around February 2012 and the external members joined in the beginning of the summer. During the spring a lot of brainstorming was done to find the perfect project, and in the beginning of July we started the lab work. Of course gaining good results is the prime goal, but having a fun and educational summer with the team is equally important.

Ryan
Ryan is a senior in the chemical engineering department   at UW-Madison. Originally he was interested in industrial research, but synthetic biology soon stole his heart. When not in the lab, Ryan can be spotted in many places on campus. He spends late nights in the concrete canoe lab, mixing and sanding concrete repeatedly. He also is a tour guide and tutors for organic chemistry. Ryan intends to go to grad school after his last year at Madison, hopefully to pursue his passion for synthetic biology.
Michael
Michael is a sophomore in the biochemistry department with both math and physics minors. After working in labs at the Mayo Clinic during high school, and receiving an award at the International Science and Engineering Fair for his immunology research done there, Michael jumped straight into research upon arriving at the UW. Michael has for many years had a passion for synthetic biology and the potential in holds. In his spare time Michael can be found fencing, larping, role-playing, reading, or otherwise being a nerd. Michael plans to go to grad school, pursuing a PhD with every plan of returning to synthetic biology in his future.
Chris
Chris is a senior in Microbiology, minoring in Business Entrepreneurship, and is interested in biofuels, biorefining, and the future of the energy economy. He has done research in materials science, pharmaceutical discovery, and unconventional yeast metabolism. When not pondering the fate of humanity, Chris enjoys swimming, water polo, and sailing big boats.
Charles
Charles Johnson is a Junior in the department of Chemical and Biological Engineering at UW-Madison. He is interested in studying the many different ways synthetic biology can be used to help the world, from medical applications to biofuels. When Charlie is not in the lab he wants fallow in his family's footsteps by helping those less fortunate than him, his older brother and grandmother dedicated their lives to teaching in the inner city of Chicago, while his parents have been representing people who could not afford lawyers for 30 plus years, and his younger brother works in a group home helping abused and neglected children get a safe place to live and learn.
Eric
Eric was on the 2011 UW-Madison iGEM team, and returned this year as a mentor. He is interested in developing novel, robust genetic systems and circuits. He spent much of his undergraduate career developing systems for engineering cyanobacteria, and is leaving us in the fall to begin the PhD program at UC Davis in the Microbiology Graduate Group. When he's not busy tweeting as @LabBadger or finding new, dreadful music, he's usually out riding his rusty bike through alleys full of broken glass.
Menuka
Menuka Samaranayake is a senior at the University of Wisconsin-Madison is double-majoring in Microbiology and Political Science. This is Menuka's first foray into the huge, exciting world of conducting research, and he feels that this opportunity of competing in iGEM has been an invaluable experience. Menuka has no idea what his career goals are, but would at some point work in the government.  In his spare time, he likes to chill with cats

Yishen
Yishen is a sophomore in Biomedical Engineering department of University of Wisconsin Madison. He decided to study biology:  genetic engineering in specific around middle school. After finishing up his high school education in China, he traveled to the U.S. and became a student of University of Wisconsin. He wishes that in the future, he could become a better scientist at synthetic biology and genetic engineer so that he could convey many of his ideas much more effectively and efficiently. In his spare time, Yishen would prefer spending his time exercising Chinese kung fu in the hope of better physical condition and a more peaceful state of mind.

Gothenburg
As the second biggest city in Sweden and the city with the most students Gothenburg is a great place if you want to experience the student life as well as living in a big city. The city is stuffed with kind people and a lot of things to do on a relatively small area. This combined with beautiful nature such as central parks, “slottsskogen”, “botaniska trädgården” and the constant presence of water from rivers and the sea makes Gothenburg very living.
In your free time there are a lot of different things to do, since the city of Gothenburg offers something to every taste. There are two reoccurring music festivals in Gothenburg each year namely Way Out West and Metaltown. These two combined with the annual Kulturkalaset, which is a practically free cultural party in the center of the city (consisting of music, art, dance and theatre among others), should cover all the cultural interests any one could have. Gothenburg have also top performing sports teams in the highest divisions in for example; football, ice hockey and handball. The city also supplies a lot of different shopping stores, coffee shops and a vibrant night life. In addition it holds the largest amusement park in Scandinavia.
Here is an advertising video about Gothenburg
Chalmers University of Technology
At Chalmers University of Technology research and teaching are conducted on a broad front within natural science, technology and architecture. The educational programmes focus on the individual’s development with the help of supervision, problem-solving, industrial and research contact, sustainable development and reality-based leadership.  Chalmers develops its structures for recruitment and promotion so that excellence within research and education, the interplay between various perspectives, long term sustainable growth, equal environments and integrated diversity are strengthened.
Chalmers was founded in 1829 as a result of a donation from the director of the Swedish East India Company, William Chalmers. His motto, and Chalmers’, is: Avancez!

Idea
The ideas from the Chalmers iGEM team were presented for the supervisors and advisors during a meeting. The supervisors and advisors only commented on the projects feasibility. The idea to develop a biodegradable pregnancy test kit was “thought out” by the students.  The supervisors and advisors then helped the students to proceed with the project by illustrating the usefulness of the pheromone pathway. The supervisors also provided relevant articles.
Homepage
All text, photos and graphics are written/taken/made by the students. The only exceptions are the sponsor logos and text that are directly provided by the sponsors.
Practical lab work and preparations
All preparations for the laboratory work except some common media and plates were done by the students.
All laboratory work during the summer has been performed by the students. The students received some advice how to perform the experiments from supervisors and other staff in the System Biology group at Chalmers.
Materials
The LHCGR gene was ordered from a synthesizing company. The fmo gene was provided by Si Wouk Kim from Chosun University in South Korea and the tryptophanase gene was derived from genomic DNA from E.coli. The FIG1 promoter was amplified from genomic yeast DNA.
The final strain used (IMFD-73) was provided by the Kondo group from Kobe University in Japan and has the endogenous GPCR Ste2 and the feedback regulator Sst2 deleted. Five amino acids in the native yeast Gα protein are replaced by the corresponding ones from the human Gα protein.
The lab strain CEN.PK 113-11C and the plasmids pSP-GM1 and pIYC04 were received from the System Biology Group at Chalmers.
Modeling
The idea to model the yeast pheromone pathway and to modify it to suit our needs was given to us by our supervisor Torbjörn Lundh. Ideas and suggestions of how to model our pathway was taken from different articles which we found ourselves in different databases. To solve the system of ODE's MATLAB was used.
With many thanks to our generous sponsors:

Since the research strategy of systems biology is well fit to analyze the biological complex systems. I am applying this strategy on the mechanism of the complex diseases such as cancer and diabetes. My ongoing project is to identify biomarkers in order to detect the progress stages of the diabetes. As a metabolic disease, diabetes-related proteins tend to enter the circulation system, thus the biomarker discovery in plasma has the potential to play an important role in the early detection and treatment of diabetes. We have developed systematic approaches based on proteomics and bioinformatics to analyze human normal and diabetic serum. In addition, I have planed to analyze the genetic and environmental factors and their interactions during the progressing of the type 2 diabetes with systems-biology approaches.

Wuyang Chen
Wuyang Chen
Hello everyone, I'm Wuyang Chen, a junior student majoring in Life Science. I live in a pleasant city on a bank of Yangtze River. My parents plant many beautiful plants and feed a dog, two turtles and 20 or so pigeons in our house, which cultivated my passion for biology. I'm so thankful for my parents!
I think it is a brilliant idea to combine computer modeling and biology, which can help people predict a behavior of a system and test it by advanced biotechnology. So I join iGEM, to take part into the research of synthetic biology in person and realize some interesting projects. The past year in iGEM would be a meaningful and fantastic journey to me!
When taking a rest, I would like to tennis and listen to music. I love the music from the Secret Garden and the talent musician Jeo Hisaishi best!

I decided to participate in iGEM not only to do some interesting research, but also to learn how to turn a simple idea to a successful work. In the 2012 USTC iGEM team, I learned much knowledge about synthetic biology and had a good time with the team members. Previous to iGEM, I worked in the lab of analytical chemistry at USTC, trying to use a fluorescent material as novel molecular probe to find the cancer cell using imaging technology. In my leisure time, I like to play table-tennis and badminton.

I am a senior majoring in Chemistry in University of Science and Technology. I took part in 2012 USTC iGEM team because I was interesting in biology especially synthetic biology. I felt excited when I did the experiment and studied the new knowledge in this summer. I also did financial work in our team. I like reading books in my leisure time, sometimes also watch the movies.

Hi, everyone. I am Jinxin Wang, a sophomore student majoring in biology at University of Science and Technology of China. With tremendous interest in iGEM, I am delighted to share two-month time with my teammates. At the period of my time in laboratory, I have learnt a lot of valuable spirits, such as teamwork, patience and insistence.
As a sophomore student, I am not familiar with scientific research. In retrospect, I find myself standing on a solid basis in both theory and experience. But things turn better after I join iGEM. It is not only a interesting competition, but also a useful method making me realize the secret of synthetic biology. I like it very much~

Hi! I am a junior student majoring in Biology at University of science and technology of China. Being a member of the USTC iGEM2012, I have learned a lot during this summer. It attracts me into the world of synthetic biology. Besides, I pick up some html&css language and construct my first website--our wiki! That is a process where I make every efforts to rise to the challenge. What's more, iGEM has taught me how to cooperate with others. Without those discussions with my partners, I can hardly achieve what I have done. I feel so lucky here and would like to say that IGEM is the coolest game I have ever played!

This guy is Xingwen Chen,a rising Junior majoring in Life Science.
The boy started his erupting interest on all kinds of creatures since his childhood. He luckily spent a lot of childhood in the countryside. Catching insects and picking wild potherbs were his favorite. And his dream was an entomologist.
Soon, the naughty kid learned about cell, gene and protein. And he knew Darwin, Mendel and Watson. He found something more attracting than insects.No one could change his passion on biology then. And his dreame was obviously a biologist.
Now, in college, the ignorant guy amazingly found his eyesight too narrow before. In fact, what he can see in the universe of life science is just a drop in a ocean. He had to choose one particular drop even though he didn't want to leave any drop. It was at that time that he noticed synthetic biology. And then came iGEM.
The 'crazy' guy loves and enjoys designing. In winter, brainstorming really excited him and he felt inspiration erupting. And this summer, he did a lot experiment to verify their thoughts. Finally, he could skillfully complete all the experiments they needed. Besides, analyzing result and puttting forward hypothesis was his another enjoyment. What's more, he learned how to manage his time!
In the future, we have reasons to expect the guy to stand on the stage of the world.

Xuyuan Gao
I’m a junior and study Life Science at USTC. My research interests span antineoplastic and Brain-computer interface, but I am also interested in the synthetic biology. For, one day, it may play an important role in making the antineoplastic. And we can use some engineered bacteria to kill the cancer cell or induce the cancer cell to become a normal cell. What interests me more is that iGEM can make me consider a lot about the project and practice the ability to solve the problem by myself. I like to discuss academic topic with others. During our experiment there will be lots of new problems, and then we can try our best to overcome these difficulties. It’s a challenge and we can learn a lot from these challenges, and I take delight in overcoming these difficulties. After USTC, I want to pursue Ph.D in the aspect of antineoplastic or Brain-computer interface, for making more contributions to human beings.

Hi! I’m Jiawei He, a junior student majoring in chemical physics. My current research is about nano materials.
This summer, I participate in iGEM and gain so much fun! I like “manipulating” E.coli, because I can achieve the function I need from them. This experience is quite enjoyable, for I practise my experimenting skills and get a sense of achievement, especially during the construction of genetic circuits.
In my leisure time, I like playing table tenis, listening to music and reading science fictions. Contact me via hjwwlm@gmail.com .

I am a junior student from the school of the gifted young, USTC . Though my major is organic chemistry and my current research is about nano materials , I have a great passion for biology ever since junior high. I love challenging myself, so I chose to take part in this year's iGEM and cooperated with my teammates to work on the project as well as the wiki. I had a great time working with my lovely teammates and doing the experiments . With the help of this experience, I have a better understanding of synthetic biology. My email: unheilig@mail.ustc.edu.cn.

I'm Zheng Xuexuan, a student from Life Science School, USTC. I take part in IGEM2012 because I want to challenge myself, that is to say , I want to confirm how much knowledge I've gotten and how many problems in life science can I solve. Through this half year, I've gained lots of improvement both in my experiment skills and in my horizon of life science. Thanks, my teammates. And thanks, IGEM2012.

Hi ~
I'm Chen Xi, who is a senior student from the department of chemical physics of USTC now. In this summer, I spent my most time in the synthetic biology laboratory where I had never known about. During this vacation, I had a wonderful time with my teammates and I felt lucky  to have this experience during my university.
Jie Wang

Hi, I am a senior guy majoring physics in USTC. I am especially interested in condensed matter theory. However, iGEM provided me with an opportunity to put what I learned into practice.
Biology is one of my interests since my childhood. With the hope to see how much the frontier biology research differs from my childhood dream, I joined iGEM team last year. During this year, I equipped myself with enough biology knowledge, especially in synthetic biology, which in my mind is quite an interesting and promising area that scientists designed, modeled and set up biological functional parts to solve real problems and to perform basic scientific research as well.
I treasure a lot the time I worked with my teammates together during the summer. In our project, I designed a computation model based on my knowledge learned in computational physics class. What is more, with the help from biology department students, I set up ODEs to describe our system. It is exciting to see how effective these two 'weapons' works!
Beyond academic activity, I am an easygoing boy interested in painting, chess, movie, traveling bicycling, plants and animals and so on. I am glad to be your friends!

Hi,I am a freshman in USTC with my major in lifescience.With the curiosity about the principle of lives,I choose that major and participate in this competition.I enjoy the process of creating new species useful although i could merely do our teammates a favour with my poor knowledge as well as indigent experience and sometimes help to compile our wiki.In the end of the whole stage,I am amazing about how great the achievements a united group could make.The competition not only give me a early chance to be in touch with the life style of laboratory,but also let me meet a lot of pleasent companion.
Yangming YUE
Yangming YUE
HI,I am a rising sophomore in school of life science at USTC.I am excited about participating in iGEM because I am very interested in synthetic biology and wants to learn more. I am interested in synthetic biology because i think it will be very useful solving some very important problem ,such as cancer ,HIV ,etc .In the future, I want to design something with synthetic biology to help those people to decrease their pain and cure them. In the laboratory, as a fresh man, my experiment skill is not as good as other senior students. So I always play a helper or a cooperator. in addition, I also do some work during the human practice part. I really think our iGEM team is a good one. I learn a lot in the team, not only in experiment skill and knowledge of synthetic biology ,but also in cooperate skill and communicate skill. In the end ,I really appreciate ustc iGEM team to give me a chance to take part in this team.

Sitao Zhang
Hello everybody, I am Zhang Sitao , a freshman  of USTC .
My major is life science.  I am an assistant of all the other guys in my team, in other word, my duty is to keep every fellows feel more comfortable and convenient while they are doing their work . Certainly I have many other work to do, helping figure out the main direction of our theme, combining some bioparts together and doing some survey during the human practice part .  For I have a strong ability of communicating and cooperating, everybody loves me , in my view . Personally speaking, iGEM just establishes a board for many biology nuts from every parts of the world, it is meaningful for the mixing of science and interest.  Though I am not the main force of our team, but things will get changed the next time of this game , I will come back for the honor of my university !

As far as I remember I have always been interested in science, especially in biology : ""how does it work ?"" was my favorite question. I like to learn and understand new things and I am very open-minded. Next year I will graduate with a Master in nanobiology and nanobiotechnology and I am looking forward to do a PhD in this field. I would love to go abroad during these last years of study.
More about me
I grew up in the Alps and as a true ""haute alpine"" I like mountain and sport. I like challenges and that's why I'm very happy and excited by the iGEM adventure !

engineering studies in the prevention of industrial risks, occupational health and environment (beginning my 3rd year of engineering school = M2)
Presentation
Interdisciplinarity, this is what I want to reach. Before beginning my study as a real student, I passed my baccalaureat in science, with the specialty biology and physics. After this I did two-year highly selective classes to prepare for the competitive exams to the Grandes Ecoles. Then I did a first year in the engineering school of the University of Grenoble 1. Currently I am in the second year and I intend to improve my skills.
Future projects
After my last year at Polytech Grenoble and my diploma as an engineer in prevention of risk, I will do a master of management in the specialty of business administration. Then I would like to work in the field of transport and more precisely with trains. What is the link with synthetic biology? None, but biological risks are everywhere. Thus this experience is a plus for me.  And as I wrote before, interdisciplinarity, this is what I want to reach.

Engineering studies in the field of Mathematics and Computer Science, 2nd year
Presentation
I am in second year of Mathematics and Computer Science Engineering, I am studying graphic modelisation, operating systems and mathematics for optimisation and modeling. I have always been interested in how different fields of science could cooperate, iGEM was a unique chance to discover it. I think it is going to be an awesome experience, I cannot wait to be in Boston!

Robert Baptist
CEA-LETI, Minatec
Research Director
Robert Baptist joined CEA-LETI, a laboratory for microelectronics, in 1982. His main research interest was solid state physics and information and their applications to micro-nano technologies. Working on nano-sciences since 2000 opened him new horizons thanks to the study of hybrid materials. The door was opened to bacteria! In 2010 he participated to the creation of the first iGEM group in Grenoble and learned a lot about the relationship of computers to living cells and also about pedagogy! Learning so much just before retiring is a big pleasure in a professional career!
Franz Bruckert
Grenoble INP
Teacher researcher in biology
To my point of view, the most interesting aspect of the iGEM project is the collective construction of a new way of doing bioengineering. The modular approach is clearly more efficient in terms of experimental effort and it also helps understanding how cellular functions are organized. Implementing new functions in bacteria should in turn help to build up more efficient ways to represent the living beings complexity. Besides that, I like and challenges and iGEM is all of this.
Hidde De Jong
INRIA Grenoble - Rhônes-Alpes
PhD in computer science, University of Twente, the Netherlands
An engineer by training, I like to do interdisciplinary research, at the interface of biology, computer science, and mathematics. More specifically, since a number of years I have been interested in the modeling of the regulatory networks controlling the functioning of  bacteria. Synthetic biology proposes an interesting approach for better understanding these networks: can we modify the network connections so as to extend the behavioral repertoire of bacterial cells? The iGEM competition addresses these questions in an original way, at the same time playful and highly demanding.
Hans Geiselmann
Grenoble University
Teacher researcher in microbiology
I am a microbiologist at the university of Grenoble. In the past, I have combined biophysics, molecular biology and bacteriology to understand the functioning of Escherichia coli. More recently, in a systems biology approach, I have used precise measurements of gene expression to test predictions of mathematical models of the corresponding regulatory system. Synthetic biology, and thus iGEM, is the next step in understanding biological systems: if we really understand the functioning of a system, we can modify its behavior. In iGEM we move from designing a desired behavior to instantiating the network in the real organism: a formidable challenge in interdisciplinary research and a very stimulating endeavor, in large parts thanks to a team of excellent and motivated students from different backgrounds.
Delphine Ropers
INRIA Grenoble - Rhônes-Alpes
Researcher in system biology
Graduated in Biochemistry,  I developed a strong interest for pluridisciplinarity in the course of my training. I received a PhD in Molecular Biology from Nancy University for my work on the regulation of HIV-1 RNA alternative splicing by modeling and experimental approaches. I am now a researcher within the Systems Biology group Ibis at Inria Grenoble - Rhône-Alpes, a French research institute in computer science and control. I work on the mathematical modeling and experimental validation of biochemical regulatory networks involved in bacterial adaptation to environmental cues.
Marianne Weidenhaupt
Grenoble INP
Teacher researcher in biology and immunology
I am a biology and immunology teacher at the Grenoble Institute of Technology-Phelma. One of the important points of my teaching is to train students to be able to work at the interface of different scientific disciplines. iGem is a very exciting challenge that plunges us straight into interdisciplinarity and puts teachers and students face to face with what we aim for in our daily work. Personally I worked in bacterial genetics during my PhD, a field I left some 15 years ago and which I am more than happy to work in again with our team.

Engineering studies in the field of Physics specialized, 2nd year
Presentation
I have always been passionated about science and wanted this passion to become my work. I quickly found a particular affinity with physics. That's why I did a baccalaureat in engineering sciences. Then I did an intense training in physics, mathematics and mecanics for 2 years in order to integrate my current engineering school Phelma. I begin now my specialization in nanosciences.
More about me
I still have two years before I graduate. I am going to spend my second year of engineering school at Imperial College London before coming back in Grenoble. Then I will probably spend three more years of studying to do a PhD in nanosciences. This field could bring me in research and I am also really interested in working as an engineer.

Engineering studies in the field of Material science, 2nd year
Presentation
What I find extremely fascinating about science is the interdisciplinary approach. It makes you learn about other science fields and open your mind to different methods and different ways of thinking. So when I heard about the iGEM competition, I just could not ignore the appeal of synthetic biology, a totally unexplored field for me.
More about me
Now I am studying materials science at Grenoble Institute of Technology-Phelma. Next, I aim to specialize in the study of nano-materials and undertake a PhD. I’m also interested in travelling and discovering different cultures. So I will mainly try to look for an internship and probably a M2 and/or a PhD abroad. I hope materials science will give me the opportunity to get a dynamic job that meets my ambitions.

Master 2 studies in Nanosciences, Nanobiology and Nanobiotechnologies.
Presentation
Since my childhood I have always been attracted by sciences in general. Later, I got more interested in biology and choose to  make my bachelor in this field. During the last year of my bachelor I encountered Nanobiotechnologies this triggered something in me. I realized that I wanted to work in this field. In this optic, I decided to do my Master 2 in Nanosciences at the Joseph Fourier University.
Future projects
After my graduation, I would like to continue with a PhD in the field of Nanobiotechnologies. I would like to work in research and development either in industrial or academic facilities.

Engineering studies in the field of Mathematics and Computer Science, 3rd year (equivalent of master 2)
Presentation
I've always loved mathematics. I wanted to take part in IGEM because I think that it is a great opportunity to discover the field of synthetic biology, which is in my point of view a forward looking sector. I am now beginning my last year of study, which I will do at Imperial College London in the mathematical department.
More about me
As I said I really like mathematics, especially numerical and combinatorial optimisation, topology, probability and statistics. I've been responsible of the whole modeling part in the IGEM project.In particular, i've done the amplification module alone, except the stochastic part on which Julie Herrbach worked with my help. I don't know yet if I want to work in  research or not, but I would like to be able to use my skills in synthetic biology or maybe aeronautical or energy field. Thus, I want to undertake a phd at the end of this year.

""Trust me, I'm an engineer.""
Jean-Baptiste Lugagne
Grenoble INP - Phelma
I recently finished my studies in signal processing. Last year, I participated to the competition with the Grenoble team and got hooked up in the first few months. I continued in this domain and, with my skills in applied maths, statistics and computer science, joined the so-called 'second wave' of synthetic biology. The competition is an exceptional opportunity, both on the human and scientific level, and I think it's important for people like me to reach back and help other students have the same chances again.
Stéphane Pinhal
PhD student in Systems and Synthetic Biology
Interested in engineering the living, I joined the iGEM Paris Liliane Bettencourt 2010 team. I think iGEM is very formative on both scientific and human side. So I couldn't miss this adventure. We won the Best Foundational Advance Prize. In 2011, I was the advisor of the iGEM Grenoble team. It was a new challenge because it was the fist participation of a team from Grenoble. I shared my experience with them and help them to reach the Final. In order to have a place where you can talk and share about Synthetic Biology, I've founded the first club of Synthetic Biology in Grenoble: SynBioGre. This year, I'm an advisor of the iGEM Grenoble team … again! Rise and shine Grenoble 2012 ! ;)
Valentin Zulkower
PhD student in Systems Biology
I was trained as an engineer in Paris and spent two years eating schnitzels and statistics in Vienna, Austria. Meanwhile a personal project ( a cat with dust-adhesive hair... ) turned me into a synthetic biology enthusiast, and further readings led me to a Ph.D. in systems biology at the INRIA, in Grenoble. In short, I am a Mowgli maths nerd raised by biologists !

First steps
Team assembly
We began assembling our team in January and are holding weekly meetings since then. Most of the people didn't know about iGEM so we presented it in various scientific lectures and told all our friends about it. At the initial meeting we presented the iGEM competition and a few previous iGEM projects. In our following weekly meetings we learned more about iGEM (time schedule, formalities, registration, team composition, finances) and compiled lists of project ideas.
Finding support and advisors
We presented our team to the head of department Prof. Nordheim (Department of Molecular Biology) where we readily found support and enthusiasm. Then we went on to talk to specific specialist faculty members with whom we held multiple conferences dedicated to project idea discussion and elaboration.
Looking for a place to work
After compiling our team, we still had to find an appropriate place to work on our project. To do so, we needed relevant lab equipment like pipettes, PCR, centrifuges, deep freezers etc. Prof. Dr. Ralf-Peter Jansen, head of his research group that engages for example in research of mRNA and RNA-binding proteins in yeast, offered us a well-appointed laboratory at Interfakultäres Institut für Biochemie with all the machines and chemicals we required.

For the majority of us, iGEM means the most extensive project in research ever tackled. So we had to prepare a labor script that comprises all necessary steps described as detailed as possible. Furthermore we had to stay within the time schedule in order that we do not spend too much time on certain steps.

Project idea
The project idea - to detect and/or degrade steroids - was proposed by the student team after lenghty meetings.
System design
The overall design (including selection of vectors, promoters and genes) was conducted in close cooperation with Prof. Jansen. Primer design was performed with students and Dr. Apel. At all times students were present. Each step was explained to all students so everyone has knowledge of the entire process.
Lab supplies
LB medium was initially prepared by the student team to learn the protocol. Later on, LB was provided by the host lab. SOB and TAE buffer were always prepared by the students. Agar plates were produced by the students with exception of the first batch which was provided by the host lab.
Lab hardware
All lab hardware was operated by the students. Thermocycler programs were initially set up with advise.
Sequencing
Sequencing was performed by an external provider. All sequencing results were evaluated by the students. In some cases, secquencing primers were created in collaboration with advisors.
Lab work
Lab work was conducted by the students. Advisors or host lab personnel did not perform any experiments. Their involvement was advise and consultion only.

Where we're from
Interfaculty Institute of Biochemistry, location of our labs
We study at the Eberhard Karls Universität Tübingen which has plenty of course of studies in the Humanities and Sciences. It goes back to the 15th century and was home to many famous poets and thinkers.
Located in Tübingen is also the past laboratory of Friedrich Miescher in Schloss Hohentübingen where he discovered the nucleic acids (Nuclein) in 1868.
Nobel laureate Christiane Nüsslein-Volhard is Director at the Max-Planck-Institut für Entwicklungsbiologie (developmental biology), her work with Drosophila melanogaster and zebrafish Danio rerio greatly improved our present-day understanding of embryonal developement.
Neckar
We come from the beautiful city of Tübingen , located in Southern Germany on the Neckar river. Tübingen is home to approx. 25,000 students, among the 85,000 citizens. Furthermore Tübingen is the city with the lowest average age of Germany.
Tübingen is a location of several research institute, such as:
Max Planck Institute for Biological Cybernetics
Max Planck Institute for Developmental Biology
The Friedrich Miescher Laboratory of the MPG
Last but not least the university maintains the Botanischer Garten , where a rich variety of plants from all over the world grows.
So don't hesitate and spend a day or two in our wonderful and young city on your next trip to Germany.

The NRP UEA iGEM Team 2012
The iGEM 2012 team for the Norwich Research Park and University of East Anglia (NRP UEA) are a close knit group of seven biology-based undergraduate students working in the labs within UEA’s BIO building. They are the second iGEM team that the NRP has produced and truly relish the opportunity to compete in a competition that has placed itself in such an innovative and exciting field of biology.
The NRP is one of Europe's largest concentrations of researchers in the life sciences and the environment, the UEA being a core constituent of the park. Known for its abundance of rabbits, its Ziggurats (as seen in various album covers) and its world-leading research. Despite having a olympic sized swimming pool on campus, the team prefer taking leisurely swimming in the river Yare that flows through the campus, a site of special scientific interest. It is frequented by cuckoos, sedge warblers, great crested grebes and, if you're lucky, you will see the odd flock of students too!
The iGEM team really are spoiled by both the natural beauty of their surroundings and the teaching excellence. Despite only having two main official academic advisers, practically everyone in the UEA School of Biology has very kindly imparted some of their wisdom to the student participance, as well as members of the John Innes Centre and the rest of the NRP, making the project a real representation of UEAs best and brightest!
The Team Members
Joy Edwards-Hicks
Biomedicine Undergraduate
Joy is going into her third year and is looking forward to a future career working within cell biology; preferably working in a lab out in the jungle somewhere! She has done a fantastic job of managing the lab, as well as the human practices side of the NRP UEA iGEM team, liasing with places such as STAR Radio and the Norwich Forum to score the team some brilliant opportunities to present the project. In her spare time Joy is normally found in the shops, until they close, when she can be found surfing eBay adding to her already-impressive clothes and shoes collection.
Khadija Ouadi
Molecular Biology & Genetics Undergraduate
Khadija anticipates beginning her third year of studies in September, and as someone that finds the intricacy of molecular biology amazing, she hopes to earn a living in academic research. iGEM has proved to be an experience she has relished, educating her both in what life in academia entails and in her own skill sets. Currently, her interests include tricking Rebecca into pegging herself in the lab groups many Peg Wars, failing to teach herself to play the guitar and using OligoAnalyser to make pretty shapes out of DNA constructs!
Lukas Harnisch
Biomedicine Undergraduate
Lukas is entering his 3rd year of studying Biomedicine. For him iGEM is a great opportunity to dive into the world of synthetic biology, the possibility to learn new skills and broaden his understanding of this field of research. To meet and collaborate with students from all over the world just adds even more enjoyment to the project. This summer he is looking forward to spending lots of time with his team members both inside the lab and outside. In his free time he enjoys photography, cooking and cycling, as well as travelling, and is therefore especially excited to go to this years jamboree in Amsterdam.
Pascoe Harvey
Biological Sciences Undergraduate
Pascoe is a Biological Sciences undergraduate, about to enter his final year. The iGEM experience has been invaluable to him and he is now strongly considering a future in academia specialising in synthetic biology. The project has fortified his presentational skills and blue sky thinking.  It has also further developed his research and practical lab skills within a team environment from his previous work experience involving research into curculionoidea morphology in the Natural History Museum. He has a diverse range of interests from sports to the arts to politics. He is the only member who can ride a unicycle and is currently teaching his fellow iGEMers his self taught circus skills.
Rachel Dobson
Molecular Biology & Genetics Undergraduate
Rachel is a smiley, enthusiastic second year student, studying Molecular Biology and Genetics at UEA. Over the last two years at UEA, she has also developed an interest in cell biology and is keen to continue further studies in this area. She has really enjoyed her summer, from getting to know the other iGEMers while chilling and playing games by the lake, to listening to a wide variety of music while carrying out aspects of wet lab. Rachel likes the variation of tasks that she has been able to undertake as a consequence of participating in this rewarding competition, both the practical and research side, as well as taking part with the elements of human outreach. When Rachel is not in the lab she is usually filling her time being very active, for example she supervises a weekly cooking class for a local charity, and more recently she has been improving her badminton skills.
Rebecca Lo
Molecular Biology & Genetics Undergraduate
Rebecca is about to enter her final year at UEA. After university she plans to pursue a career in academia with a particular interest in plant genetics. She greatly anticipates an iGEM filled summer. Applying for iGEM was an easy decision for her as it brought about the opportunity to meet students with similar interests to her, gain research experience, and of course have 10 weeks of awesomeness! Currently, her greatest joy would be to get revenge on Khadija in Peg Wars. She loves KPop, especially songs that blows your brains out, only difference is you do you the shooting. She also loves playing team sports but can be rather competitive; someone always gets hurt! She has a long list of accidental injuries, of which none are to herself, so you have been warned…
Russell Gritton
Biomedicine Undergraduate
Russell is a third-year Biomedicine student looking forward to a career in cell biology research. He sees iGEM as a fantastic opportunity to become a part of a new, innovative branch of science with many real-world applications for the future, and is therefore excited to be a part of this year’s NRP UEA team. He particularly likes the creative side of the project and is the main user of the team’s Twitter, as well as having designed the Wiki and many of the graphics on it. In his free time Russell enjoys good music and good company, and is currently trying to learn the ukulele.
Richard Bowater
Advisor - Senior Lectuer
Richard is a senior lecturer at the University of East Anglia, in the School of Biological Sciences. He specialises in Biochemistry, and is currently leading a research team at UEA. The work carried out within his lab studies the macromolecular interactions of DNA repair mechanisms in bacteria, in particular focusing on DNA ligases. Not only is he the founder of the team, but he also the spiritual and academic advisor of the team, therefore consistently keeping the team and their project on track.
Richard Kelwick
Advisor - PhD Student
Richard Kelwick is a doctoral Student at UEA, focusing his studies in Cancer Research. His research is centered around understanding the role of proteases in breast cancer and is interested in elucidating the tumour suppressor functions of several metalloproteinases, particularly ADAMTS15. Richard is THE KING of all things technological. Among the iGEM team he is renowned for his tweeting as he tweets more than Stephen Fry, as well as introducing google hangout to the UK team meet up. Richard is fueled by Twix's, giving him the energy that makes him super efficient and always the guy to save the day. It is Richards great advice, organisation of events and elevating the team spirit higher than a giraffe on stilts makes the NRP-UEA iGEM team the team that it is- #Thank you Richard and thank god for Twix's.
Amy Congdon
NRP UEA iGEM Artist
Amy Congdon completed her BA in Contemporary Textile Practices, at Norwich University College of Arts, and then went on to do her masters in Textile Futures, based at Central Saint Martins in London. Amy has played an important role as the team’s artist, since she got in touch with the team a few months before they started on their project. She is fascinated between the links of design, craft and science, and has used her interest to help the team to engage with the public. The team are very thankful to have her on board for her creative input, as well as her dedication and time to the team’s project.  Amy has been very active within our human outreach program; from designing the team’s eye catching logo, to directing and editing their film.
Team Spirit
The iGEM competition 2012 was an amazing time for the whole NRP UEA team. At the beginning of the 12 weeks that our project would span, we didn't imagine the amount of knowledge and experience we would gain and the fun we would have. Not only did we work with many very interesting researchers at our university, we also became part of the great community that iGEM is and met other students that were just as drawn in by synthetic biology as we were.  A highlight for this was definitely the UK team meetup that we hosted in London.  All this made us grow close together as a team and the summer flew by. We celebrated our results and rejoiced when hard work payed off. But not only did we enjoy our time in the lab, we also made the most of our free time. We threw birthday parties, traveled together, enjoyed culture and music and in general just had a good time. To be honest, not everything was pleasant and in the lab especially first tries often did not succeed. We soon realised that research can confront you with setbacks that press down hard on moral. Everyone who has experienced this will know that team spirit is very important. Be it a failed gel purification or the realisation that you spend the last 3 days working with the wrong plasmid, it is never pleasant to see a team member disappointed. We were lucky to have an easy cure for this. We passed the time with fun games that sprung our imagination or were inspired by funny realisations or activities. Pegging, Dress-Up Thursday and mini prep queen/king, to name only things that caused lots of laughter and joy. But the game Ninjas was always the highlight be it during late nights of research, sunny lunch breaks or during the UK meetup where we played with lots of other teams. Team spirit has been high the whole time of iGEM 2012 and was one of the things that made this summer so rememberable. Read on and be inspired by the fun!
When 7 UEA undergraduates collide, we come together and have lots and lots of fun. Thanks to this awesome opportunity that iGEM has provided, the last few months have been AMAZING. We worked really hard but we also played hard and we would like to take you through some of our experiences and share the Joy - yes pun intended, with you.
This was our 10 weeks in, shortened to 6 minutes. It has been crazy experience and scary how fast it flew by. Below are some activities that we played more than a lot. We changed some of the rules around a little but we hope this gives others an idea of how to enjoy the project all the more.
For all iGEMers and researchers out there, you all know that there are times when during experiments you have some free time but not much or you just need a good pick me up, well these activities are perfect for you. They bring the team together, keep you alert and can make you laugh so hard that any stress of failed cloning or unexpected breakdowns become a thing of the past.
Ninja's
Contrary to the name of this game, you do not need to dress up in black or as turtles and throw shurikens, instead you just need to be swift, fluid and tactical. For this game you need to ideally have a large group of people but more than 3 is fine too. The aim of the game is to be the last man or woman standing.
How to
If the video demonstration is not clear enough, here is a written version of the rules. There are actually quite a different set of rules for this game but we like to keep things fast, fun and unexpected by using this set of rules (i.e. we made up bits)
1) Get into a circle and everyone put your hands to the centre and have your finger tips pretty much touching.
2) Wiggle your fingers and say ""EEEERRRRRRRRRRR Ninjas!"", on the word of ""Ninjas"", everyone jumps back from the circle and gets into a ninja-like stance. What kind of stance you get into will probably depend on what films you watch.
3) One person then starts, they pick one person who is immediately to their left or right and in one fluid motion moves to hit their hand. In the meanwhile, the person who has been targetted is also allowed to move in one fluid continual movement.
4) If the person targetted has their hand hit they are out, and the next person in their direction continues the game. If the person evades being hit, then they move, they are also allowed to choose whichever direction to move in and hence you you target.
5) This game continues till only 2 people are left. These two then stop and get back to back and on the count of three jump away and make a VERY cool ninja pose. The coolest/hardest pose is the person who starts first. The winner is the last one remaining.
Rules
1) Only hitting the person's hand counts, that means no arms! However, it does not matter whether it is the palm or back of the hand you hit.
2) When the defending person moves, if they hit the next person in the hand in the process, that person who is hit, is out. This is a sneaky move but it makes the game more interesting.
3) Some people play this game so that you are only allowed to move in one direction, but moving in both makes it more unexpected.
4) When you move, it is like a robotic movement. If you move you arm forward, you may not retract your hand in the same move. Check out the dos and don't of this in the video.
5) Defense or approach movements are allowed. For defense, it may be that you know you are very close to being hit so you purposely jump back to evade being hit. You can also jump towards a person if you are too far away.
That's it, that's all the rules of Ninjas. If you think we are crazy for playing this, we are not the only ones. At the UK meet up, we got many many people involved. Don't believe me? Check out our team spirit video. This game is a great ice breaker. You just have to get past the bit, that some people hit really hard.
Pegging Assassin
This is a long game and takes more organisation but is very simple. It is literally pegging someone. The aim of the game is to have as many pegs as you can by the end of the game.
How to
1) At the start of the game, we write every participants name on pegs and put them into a bag or envelope, anything opaque is fine.
2) The team then take out a peg each, if one person gets the peg with their own name on it, then all pegs are put back into the bag and a reselection is called.
3) Once everyone has different pegs then the pegging commences.
Rules
1) The how to is really simple, now for some ground rules. When we play in lab, we make sure that when anyone is working, that includes talking to someone about work, dry lab work or wet lab, they are not pegged.
2) You can peg that person (e.g hair) or any of the clothes that person is wearing so that means no bags. However due to 1 minute rule, you can peg clothes they are not wearing and the minute rule commences when they put that item of clothing on.
3) The one minute rule means that if you peg that person and if for a minute they do not remove the peg, then you have successfully pegged them, if not then you have to retrieve the peg and continue.
4) You can trick the person to peg themselves. Rebecca found this out the hard way and the rule stayed.
5) Once someone has been pegged, then the pegger tells the pegged and the pegged surrenders all their pegs to the pegger. Therefore, if the pegged has 4 pegs, then the pegger is very lucky indeed.
6) If you get a peg with your own name on it, then that means you can peg anyone with that peg. This seemingly messes the game up but it actually makes the game rather interesting.
7) When there are only two people left and you can't seem to successfully peg each other, then there is a tie breaker. The tie breaker is to peg someone the first. This is decided by the team. For us, it was anyone who is extremely hard to peg. To make things harder, you must peg them and remove the peg after a minute, without them noticing.
This is a good game to get advisors into too. Not just the 7 of us undergraduates played this, we roped in Richard Kelwick and Richard Bowater. Pegging rules are quite relaxed so have fun and make up and change some rules, these are rules that we kept to but some of the best games are ones that you create so create some of your own too.

Amy Congdon has acted as our team artist and has designed our logos as well as helping with the design and production of our video and various pieces of equipment for our human outreach work.
The Biochemical Society were kind enough to provide funding to go towards videos that have proven to be central to the human practices aspect of our project.
Bioline and their representative, Josh Wright, have been extremely supportive in offering us a discount from their catalogued products as well as donating plasmid isolation mini kits, PCR gel clean-up kits and enzymes.
Dr. Paul Thomas for all of his help with imaging mammalian cells, and for providing the SNAP used for producing nitric oxide.
Promega have been extremely supportive in offering us a discount from their catalogued products as well as donating PCR gel clean-up kits and DNA purification mini-preps.
Sebastian Runkel , Anke Arkenberg , Colin Lockwood and Sean McManus are PhD students at the University of East Anglia whose research involve nitric oxide. They gave in-depth presentations on nitric oxide and how to work with it. Dan Tromans is a PhD student based at the UEA and the John Innes Centre in Norwich.
The experience and advice of all of these PhD students has proven invaluable to our own project.
STAR Radio 107.9/1 FM allowed us interview time on their radio show to discuss the iGEM competition, synthetic biology, and the future applications of this branch of science. They gave us a lengthy slot on the show and helped us promote the competition and synthetic biology as a whole.
Dr. Tom Clarke helped us with all of our fluorometer studies, and we are very grateful for him taking the time to teach us how to use the equipment.
The Wellcome Trust kindly provided us with stipends that have allowed the team to work on the project for the ten week period allotted.
The UEA Annual Fund provided us with funds to cover some of the costs assoicated with participating in the iGEM competition. In particular, funds were provided for essential consumables, without which the lab work performed could not have been performed.
File:FCS banner logo.gif
UEA Flow Cytometry Services kindly provided us free usage of a flow cytometer and their expertise.
UEA Technical Staff we would like to particularly say a big thank you to all of the support that has been given to us by UEA technicians over the summer, especially at the start of our project when we were all new to independent lab work!
The UEA Enterprise and Engagement Club ,  the School of Biological Sciences at UEA and the John & Pamela Salter Trust Fund were able to provide vital funding towards travel expenses, lab consumables and other necessities for the project.

RUiGEM: 2012
Biofuels in Biology
To develop strains of bacteria that produce high levels of 1-butanol we have introduced the genes coding for a biochemical pathway from Clostridium acetobutylicum into a mutant E. coli strain that produces a high level of NADH.The combination of these chemical pathways is predicted to increase the level of butanol production.. >> Read more... Plasmid Map Results
The Etch-a-Sketch project aims to create a lawn of bacteria that can be drawn on with a laser pointer. This seemingly inconsequential task actually presents many interesting engineering challenges. We have designed a novel genetic switch to tackle these problems. If our work proves successful, it will serve as a useful model for future projects that require large signal amplification.

Here we are!
Students
Giulia Corso
Giulia Corso (born on April 2, 1988 in Feltre, Italy)           graduated with a Biological BSc at the University of Trieste          and she is now attending the first year of Functional          Genomics Master degree.
She has a balanced personality, a friendly and soft character          easy to appreciate.  Guitar was one of her passion for many          years, she played several musical genre: from the classical          music to jazz up to bossa nova. A passion unfotunately          snuffed out like the sporty ones, volleyball and snowboard.
She has a foundamental role in the team, acting as an          invisible hand to improve the website contents,          adding elements that reflect her style.
Giulia is also the reference point for the use of english, she also spreads          the news on the networks, she keeps in touch with the          people who sent us helpful parts for our project.
Elisa Clagnan
Elisa Clagnan (born on October 3,1989 in Seregno, Italy)          graduated with a Biological BSc at the University of Trieste          and she is now attending the first year of Functional          Genomics Master degree.
Elisa is a inward-looking and reflective girl, with a          jaunty hair cut that frame her pretty roundish face. Her          deep icy blue eyes, betraying sparkles of creativity, have          made her the artistic soul of our group!
During our first brainstorming she has always dampened our enthusiasm for a          project, for this reason she has gotten the nickname ""The          Critic"". Thanks to her critical attitude, we were able to          discard unfeasible projects and listen at the promising ones!
Her real love is literature, mainly French and Russian authors,          who emphasize her introspective nature and her romantic          soul that she doesn't like to highlight!
Federico Colombo
Federico Colombo (born on April 12,1988 in Modica, Italy)          has obtained a BSc degree in Biological Science at the          University of Trieste, where he is now attending the first          year of the Master degree in Functional Genomics.
He is the team member who searches and reads scientific          articles both at the beginning, during the first brainstorming          and during the practical work in lab, finding solutions to          evade the problems we encounterd.
He likes playing the guitar, it helps him to chill out and          relieve tension. He also loves going skin-diving, sport          that demand the athlete more than a physical preparation,          rather a mental maturity.
He also has a unique affinity with his labmate Elisa: they          communicate softly, probably the characteristics that differ          widely them from the other 2 team groups!
Marija Drikic
Marija Drikic (born on Novemebr 29,1988 in Serbia) is          a first year Functional Genomics Master student at the          University of Trieste, where she obtained  a BSc in Biology          and Cellular and Molecular Technologies.
In the lab she is really efficient and extremely watchful;          she navigates her way through plenty of cloning on the          immunology lab counter without any problem!!  If you are          getting crazy doing calculations, ask her for help and in          two seconds she will tell you the right answer you were          hardly looking for.
She is veeeeeery patient with her labmate Giorgio! If you          cross the door of their lab, you will hear Marija laughing          because of some mistake that Giorgio made.
Fortunately, she is not perfect. As all of us she has her          Achilles heel: reaching the tallest solutions is still          an obstacle for her and most of all orienting around the          Research Institute!!!
Giorgio Gargari
Giorgio Gargari ( born on October 2, 1988 in Torino, Italy)          graduated with a Biological BSc at the University of Trieste          and he is now attending the first year of Functional Genomics          Master degree.
Black and wild hair, black and deep eyes. He has lot          of patience and he always tries to keep peace among the          team members.          Working with him in the lab is always funny. He is able to          transform a bad day in a funny one, thanks to his joyful mood.
He is a gym lover, obsessed by his body eating lot of proteins          and plenty of vitamin supplements instead of freshy fruits          and veggies.          His drawback: everybody agrees that he has bad taste in          matching colors!!
Sara Samari
Sara Samari ( born on February 23, 1989 in Gorizia,Italy)          got a Biological BSc at the University of Trieste and          she is attending the first year of Functional Genomics          Master degree.
She is an hyperactive, energic, outgoing and self-deprecating          girl. She has the classic determined and resolute personality          of the leader, that helped the team during the months!!
She is our outreach manager, an essential role in the team,          that gave us the possibilities to organise plenty of events          to spread the SynBio knowledge in Trieste.
Photography is her passion, every picture from our website          was made with her Canon; every photo was made with passion          and competence, thanks to her devotion to this hobby.          She became a vegetarian more than a year ago, denying herself          the taste of meat, because she believes that human beings could          easily live, without killing animals to satisfy their hunger.
Aljaž Srebrnič
Aljaž Srebrnič (born on September 28, 1990 in Gorizia,Italy)          graduated from high school with qualifications in Informatics          and now studying for Physics BSc at the University of Trieste.
Aljaž is an hyperactive and joyful guy with many many hobbies!          Scout is one of them; he teaches the children the survival          techniques in the wild forest and they tenderly call him          ""Wise Bear"".  He loves robotics and he likes to be          surrounded by curious gadgets as his watch ""EZ Chronos"", upon          which he coded and installed the operating system by himself.
Aljaž has a completely different background from the other          members of the team. He is the geek of the group!! He is not          well up on biology, but he has a passion for engineering and IT.

To support the team throughout the competition, the iGEM Paris-Saclay team is supervised by three researchers and two PhD students of the Institut de Génétique et Microbiologie at Orsay.
Our advisors:
Thao Nguyên LE LAM- first year PhD- Institut de Génétique et Microbiologie “I love biology, Nature and exploring life. Combining biology and technology to create products that can be useful for everybody is wonderful. Synthetic biology is exactly what I was looking for! With the Paris-Saclay team, I hope to be able to create freely, explore and conquer new scientific horizons.”
Solenne ITHURBIDE- first year PhD- Institut de Génétique et Microbiologie “I discovered the iGEM competition in 2011 and I immediately adhered to the concept, for the scientific aspect as well as the human one. I’m very happy to participate in the creation of this new team which I am sure will go far in the competition because of its motivation. I also would like to ensure the existence of this team for the coming years, as it seems essential to me that the University Paris-Saclay is represented in this competition.
Our instructors:
Sylvie Lautru, Jean-Luc Pernodet and Philippe Bouloc are CNRS researchers at the Institut de Génétique et Microbiologie in the University Paris-Sud. They share a passion for microbiology. Their expertise covers a wide range of organisms, including the model bacterium Escherichia coli, the antibiotics producer Streptomyces and the pathogenic Staphylococcus aureus. Their experimental approaches are both global and mechanistic and their fields of interest are biotechnological and biomedical. They will manage the scientific supervision of the iGEM team Paris-Saclay 2012.

A bit about us
Hi! We are third and fourth year students from Biotechnology and Food engineering faculty in Technion - Israeli Technological Institute.
We are very excited to be the first Israeli iGEM team. Though we are newbies in iGEM competition, we hope to represent our country with honor and probably grab a medal or two... (Hmm, no pressure at all (-: )
You are welcome to contact us at any time via our group email: igem.technion@gmail.com or browse our site: Team Technion
It's us!

Mentors and Advisers
Dr. Roee Amit
Dr Amit received his undergraduate degree in Applied and Engineering Physics from Cornell University in 1994. After a short a stint in the IDF, he carried out his graduate studies on the interactions of proteins and DNA at the single molecule level in the Weizmann Institute of Science under the supervision of Prof. Joel Stavans,  completing his Ph.D in 2004. In 2006, he moved to Caltech, where he specialized in Synthetic Biology working as a post-doctoral scholar in collaboration with Prof. Scott Fraser, Frances Arnold, and Rob Phillips. In 2011, Dr Amit returned to Israel with a Senior Lecturer (Assistant Professor) appointment to start the Technion's first Synthetic Biology research lab. Dr Amit's group is focused on constructing ""Synthetic Enhancer Circuits"" for a variety of applications and research objectives. The group's primary purpose is to decipher basic enhancer design principles using a variety of microscopy, molecular engineering, and theoretical approaches, including new synthetic biology tools developed in the lab.
Dr. Orna Attar
Orna Atar is the lab manager in the synthetic biology laboratory of Prof. Roee Amit at the department of Biotechnology and Food Engineering, Technion, Haifa, Israel.
Orna received her Bachelor’s degree (1999) in life sciences from Tel Aviv University and her Master’s degree (2005) in the Interdisciplinary Program for Biotechnology in the Faculty of Biotechnology and Food Engineering from the Technion, Haifa. Orna received her Ph.D. (2010) from the Department of Human Molecular Genetics and Biochemistry from Tel Aviv University, working on rescuing genetic hearing loss in a mouse model for human deafness.
In my spare time, I like to be with my family, enjoy good music and watch movies.
Dr. Sharon Levi-Tal
Sharon Levi-Tal is currently the manager of the Laboratory of Chemistry of Foods and Bioactives in the Dept. of Biotechnology & Food Engineering at the Technion – Israel Institute of Technology.
Sharon obtained her B.Sc. in Life Sciences from the Ben Gurion University (Beer-Sheva, Israel) in 2004. She joined the Technion in 2005 and completed her PhD on the morphological characterization and structure–function relationship of different biological colloids in 2011.
Our Team - The looks and the brains
Ilya Vainberg Slutskin
I am a fourth (and final) year student in the Faculty of Biotechnology & Food Engineering in the Technion university. I first heard about synthetic biology during my third year studies as part of a lecture in a molecular biotechnology course. Since then, I was hooked. I am thrilled to learn more about the subject and to gain valuable experience in the field. Although I don't have previous experience in research I hope to be a valuable member of the team. I hope to contribute as much as possible to both the wet and dry lab as well as to the administrative department of the project.
On my free time I enjoy spending time with my wife, creating digital art using both 2d and 3d tools and watching TV series.
Evgeni Bolotin
Hi folks! I'm a fourth year student in the Faculty of Biotechnology & Food Engineering in the Technion university. Like Ilya I've heard about synthetic biology as part of a lecture in a molecular biotechnology course. I was thrilled about the possibilities that synthetic biology openes before researches and when I had a chance to participate in such a research myself as a part of iGEM experience, I said ""yes"" without hesitation.
By participating in iGEM competition I see a chance to gain valuable experience in the field that can help me a lot during my M. Sc. studies in the future. Though I don't have much experience in research, I hope to help our team as much as I can and become valuable team member.
On my spare time I like read books, watch movies and play video games. Also I like to go hiking when I have enough spare time.
Hila Korach Rechtman
I am a fourth year student in the Faculty of Biotechnology & Food Engineering in the Technion.
My first acquaintance with synthetic biology was during an introduction lecture in molecular biotechnology course, when it seemed a bit like science fiction. My biggest expectation from the iGEM project is to learn how this science fiction can be put in action. In addition, the execution of a research project from start to end is exciting to me, and I hope to get as much experience from it as I can.
Outside iGEM I enjoy playing the flout at the Technion symphonic orchestra, I am the chairman of the faculty student board and a member in the board of directors of the Technion student association. I Also love to go on hiking trips with my husband, family and friends.
Inbal Vaknin
Hi everybody!
My name is Inbal Vaknin. I'm in the end of my third year in the faculty of Biotechnology and Food engineering. I was first introduced to synthetic biology by my friend Hila, who is also on the team. She suggested I join the iGEM competition and take a part in a unique experience - of course I was enthusiastic. During the last semester, I've learnt synthetic biology profoundly - and loved it. I was inspired by it and thought about different issues we encounter during our lives and how synthetic biology could be a great solution for them.
In my spare time, I love spending time with my boyfriend, friends and family. My hobbies are riding the bicycle and watching comedy shows like Friends, The big bang theory, How I met your mother etc.
During this adventure I hope to obtain laboratory skills and understand synthetic biology, but mainly have fun and a great time.
Noa Katz
I am a third year student at the Faculty of Biotechonology and Food Engineering in the Technion. The first time I had heard about Synthetic Biology was when I received an invitation to participate in the competition. I believe that a field that combines the enormous knowledge we have gained in the field of molecular biology with the approach and technicality that the field of Engineering has to offer, allows us to obtain much greater achievements than with those two fields studied separately.
iGEM had appealed to me greatly since both the research idea and its execution is made by us - first degree students. I thank iGEM for the opportunity to be a part of something that is so close to the real world, in terms of research, lab work and problem solving.
Apart from my educational interests, I like to play chess, meet with friends, and play computer games.
Rachel Lev
I'm a senior year student in the Faculty of Biotechnology & Food Engineering in the Technion.
I first heard about synthetic biology during molecular biology course. It was one of the most interesting lectures during the course that left a lot of impression on me. So when I had a chance to participate in an iGEM competition, I said 'yes' immediately.
In my spare time I like listening to music, drawing, hiking or just hanging out with friends.
Lior Levy
I just finished my third year in the Faculty of Biotechnology & Food Engineering in the Technion.
I first heard about synthetic biology when I’ve heard about the IGEM competition. The connection between biology and programming intrigues me and there was no doubt that this new field is something that I would like to learn more about and experience with.
In my free time I work as a PhD student assistant in the field of tissue engineering at the faculty. Moreover, one of my hobbies is to dub cartoons and to narrate almost everything I hear.
Shahar Chen
I had finished my third year in the Faculty of Biotechnology and Food Engineering in the Technion. I first became acquainted with synthetic biology when I heard about IGEM, and it had intrigued me. I hope to learn a lot from this project, and get a lot of experience.
On my free time I enjoy playing computer games,spending time with friends and debating them about pretty much everything.
Asaf Blumental
I am a third year student at the faculty of Biotechnology and Food engineering at the Technion. I have been interested in biology and in computers since high school. I see synthetic biology as a field that combines both, so naturally it was very appealing to me.
I believe that participation in the iGEM project can give me a lot of experience and knowledge in the interesting new field of synthetic biology.
Apart from my studies, I enjoy reading everything I can put my hands of, listening to good music and watching movies.
Where we're from
Technion - Israel Institute of Technology is one of the oldest universities in Israel. It had been founded in 1912 and opened it's gates to the students in 1924.
Today Technion campus sprawls on the territory of 1325 dunam. In addition to different faculties and research buildings, Technion includes everything needed for students' welfare - dorms, small shopping center, sports center, bank, post office and more.
Technion has a proud history of being a home to most Israeli Nobel prize laureates, latest of them is Dan Shechtman who got Nobel prize in Chemistry in 2011 for discovery of quasi-crystals.

Achievements
We have submitted DNA for 25 BioBricks to the registry. Due to lack of time we haven't managed to put all the parts inside the shipping plasmid.
We have created new reporter system to test our YES gates and hope that it will become standard system for testing other parts as well. We used it to characterize T7 RNAP activity, the results can be seen here .
We have managed to successfully clone 4 out of 8 lambda phage fragments that the phage's genome has been divided into.
We characterized a theophylline riboswitch+mCherry construct. The results are here .
We have managed to combine a theophylline riboswitch with T7, T7*(T3), T7*(K1F), T7*(N4) by using fusion PCR under the control of a tac promoter, more details can be seen at RS section . The riboswitch with T7 and T7*(N4) were cloned into the shipping plasmid and submitted as BioBricks. Due to lack of time we hadn't transferred RS+RNAP constructs under pLux control, as was planned at the beginning.
We have added MCS to pSB1C3 plasmid backbone. This backbone is very convenient to work with, some of our parts had the same restriction sites as standard prefix and suffix found in the backbone, so we couldn't insert them into the pSB1C3 plasmid. Addition of MCS helps to circumvent this problem.
We entered experience for the following pre-existing BioBricks: pSB3C5 and BBa_I0462 .
Some of our parts (particularly the phage fragments ) were incompatible with current restriction based registry standards. Therefore, we contacted the registry, asking them to let us send parts that are incompatible with the standards. The registry told us that we must obey some registry standard or create a new standard. Thus, we decided to create a BioBrick standard to be used with Gibson Assembly, releasing users from the restriction sites limitations. Since this idea was conceived only a couple of days before the deadline, we didn't manage to develop it fully. Briefly, it can be suggested that a prefix and a suffix for a standard backbone would not include any restriction sites. Those prefix and suffix will be used for Gibson assembly of BioBricks into that backbone. For assembly of two BioBricks or more into the same backbone, the method suggested by the Gibson assembly manual may be used along with the standardized prefix and suffix.

Each team member (Yang, Eric, Jesse and Peter) contributed to multiple parts of the overall project.
All four students brainstormed possible project ideas during the Spring and finally agreed on promoter characterization using fluorogen-activating biosensors.
Yang and Eric kept the notebooks, designed experiments and followed through with the biological experiments (including cloning, culturing the cells, fluorescence spectroscopy and fluorescence microscopy). Yang designed the wiki layout and made modifications as necessary. Eric was a consultant with Peter to incorporate a biologically accurate model. Eric also designed the expanded model with Peter to include more information. Peter designed the model and derived the equations to fit our system and performed the nonlinear regression to attain the data we put onto the Parts Registry. Jesse designed the interactive circuit kit and GUI and provided the open source documentation on the wiki so that other groups may use it as a basis for their own projects.
All four students presented our project and circuit kit throughout the summer. Eric and Peter gave a presentation at Taylor Allderdice High School in Pittsburgh during the academic school year.
The summer experiments were conducted in the Mellon College of Science's Interdisciplinary Laboratory, courtesy of Dr. Karen Stump, Dr. Eric Grotzinger and Dr. Maggie Braun. The experiments during the year were conducted in Dr. Robert Murphy's lab with our team instructor Cheemeng Tan. The fluorescence spectroscopy was performed in the Molecular Biosensors and Imaging Center at Carnegie Mellon and the fluorescence microscopy was performed in Dr. Aaron Mitchell' laboratory.

SUN Fei (Sara)
My name is Sun Fei but many of my colleagues usually refer to me as Sara. I am  currently a year 2 biology student. For me, iGEM is just like a canvas for a painter. It is a place where great ideas can be sketched on and further  colorized. It is the place where beauty of accidents and findings come together.  It is the place where I can use my hands to create my world.
Sean CARIM
Life fascinates me. So as an opportunity to do work related to controlling and engineering life, iGEM was too strong a temptation to resist. I feel fortunate to be working alongside a group of dedicated students who share my interests. As a year 2 Biology major I consider the technical aspects of iGEM a refreshing chance to observe science and engineering operating in parallel. I also appreciate it as a rigorous team activity allowing us to improve our understanding both on what it is to be human as well as the dynamics of the bacteria we manipulate. Over the past months I have joined my sub-group members in building our cell wall expression construct and have conducted interviews in accordance with our human practices plans.
CHAN Yak Nok (Cola)
My name is Chan Yat Nok Cola, a year 2 student majoring in biochemistry. For me, synthetic biology is an amazing field full of possibilities, mysteries and creativity. It always gives us lots of surprises and inspirations, not to mention the sense of achievement. Thanks to iGEM for providing a chance to work along with a group of people who all have one goal, and for creating a platform to learn with pain and fun. iGEM is really “beautiful” in nature.
Ka Chun MOK
I am Ka Chun Mok, a year 2 student studying Molecular Biomedical Sciences in HKUST. In retrospect, I am attracted by the fancy world of biology when I was a high school student. During that time, GM food research was standing in the front line of the scientific field. I was inspired by the magic of synthetic biology that can make many new strains of organisms which are beneficial for the community. After I joined HKUST, I finally have the chance to taste the beauty of synthetic biology by joining then iGEM team. Frankly speaking, doing iGEM is not just being a part of a competition, but also about enjoying the process of doing synthetic biology. Thanks to that, I am glad to be involved in such a meaningful activity.
SHI Tianxing
I am Shi Tianxing, a year 2 biology student in HKUST. I have always been looking forward to understand more about the life sciences, especially with a group of biology lovers. That’s why I am here in iGEM team to help carry out the whole project. Our sub-group has been working on the recognition and binding of B. subtilis to colon cancer cells throughout the summer months, and I have been deeply involved in the building of our sub-group’s constructs from the first day. I appreciate that iGEM provides us, science beginners, a great opportunity to explore the world of genetic engineering and to share our experience with our friends, family, and other members of society all over the world.
Carson LAM
Carson is currently a year 2 student under the Molecular Biomedical Sciences program. He participated as a member of the Target Binding Module sub-group.
LAI Ka On (Sapphire)
Sapphire is currently a year 2 student pursuing a Biochemistry major. She participated as a member of the Target Binding Module sub-group.
YU Lai Cheong (Chris)
I am Yu Lai Cheong. My major is Molecular Biomedical Sciences. I am a year 2 student. Thanks to iGEM, I have received a lot of opportunities to organize things, do research, and deal with problems.
Chelsilia TANZIL
My name is Chelsi, currently in my second year in HKUST studying biochemistry. Joining iGEM as a freshman has given me lots of experience and knowledge, which I probably will never get in any class. Throughout the summer I worked with Anti-tumor Molecule Secretion Module sub- group to work on constructs which can secrete BMP2, helped with characterization of Ptms, and was in charge of the completion of 2012 HKUST iGEM Poster.
Christopher LEE
I am Christopher Lee. I study Molecular Biomedical Sciences, and am currently a year 2 student. I would like to join iGEM because it is a golden opportunity for me to decide which experiments to conduct on which particular purpose. It helps me to think carefully and to learn how to convince others with the results obtained. How to think is much more important than how to do. It is easy to know how to do since lots of protocols are available. But iGEM provides me with an opportunity to learn how to think and how to design experiments so that the results of our experiments can convince others. That is a critical skill for all scientists. As an iGEM team member, I am responsible for protein characterization.
Ilona Christy UNARTA
I am a future Chemist, who is currently still a year 2 student. Joining iGEM team does not only teach me about what synthetic biology is, but also how powerful synthetic biology can be. Through iGEM, I learnt that synthetic biology could be used in many different ways to solve a lot of world problems; just like our project, which focuses on targeting colon cancer. In the HKUST iGEM team, I worked along with Anti-tumor Molecule Secretion Module sub-group’s members to construct the plasmid consisting of DNA sequence coding for signaling peptide of B. subtilis and Bmp2. I am also helping in the poster design team.
LI Yiming (Eric)
My name is Li Yiming. I am currently a second year biochemistry student. I wish to earn the experience in lab work and enjoy the teamwork when doing iGEM. In this project, I collaborated with my teammates to get B. subtilis synthesize and secrete the protein BMP2. Although we came across many unexpected difficulties, we always persisted in our goal together. Spending all my efforts in lab will be the most wonderful memory in my life.
WANG Yuqi
I am WANG Yuqi but you can call me Cosmos. As a freshman of biochemistry in the university, I have to swallow a bunch of new information this summer. However, iGEM is about teamwork, and the whole HKUST iGEM team creates a cheerful atmosphere. It allows me, along with other members, to learn, grow and shine.
GU Bida
My name is Bida Gu, currently a second year student in Division of Life Science, HKUST. Starting as a freshman, I have benefited greatly from our iGEM team. What I learned was not only lab techniques but also skills of management and communication. During the past several months, I have helped to build one promoter and characterize two promoters for our team. I hope that in the future I will be able to contribute more to the HKUST iGEM team so that more students will be able to appreciate the beauty of synthetic biology.
QI Yi
My name is Qi Yi. I am a biochemistry majoring student, currently in the second year of my study. I joined iGEM to learn how to do research and biological lab work. Throughout the summer I helped my teammates to work on the construction of BBa_K733009 and the characterization procedures of Regulation and Control Module sub-group
YU Xiaoying (Susie)
I am Yu Xiaoying, a year 1 Biochemistry student. My colleagues usually call me Susie. I was an iGEM Asia Jamboree helper last year. The two-day competition was exciting. I listened to several presentations and got the chance to communicate with other teams’ members. I was attracted by iGEM and decided to participate in it. The whole process is tough but fun. I learned a lot through the months of lab work and human practice work. It was the first time that I spent my days in the lab, planning and carrying out experiments. As an iGEMer you may have the same experience---after weeks of failure, a construct was finally made and confirmed to work. For me that is the most fascinating part of iGEM, of science. I worked on the construction of BBa_K733009, promoters-- Pveg, Ptms, Pxyl, device containing ydcD/ydcE, and human practice. I really enjoy working with my team and best wishes for our team in 2012 iGEM competition!
Leon LEE
My name is Leon Lee, a second year Electronic Engineering student. Well, sometimes I feel like a freak in the team. After all, how could it be possible that an Electronic student mess around with a bunch of biologists? Well, the reason is that they need someone to write their Wiki page. Programming has always been one of my interests, and it is a great pleasure for me to design our Wiki page.

SEU_A iGEM 2012 would like to express thanks to the following people and organizations for their contribution to our team: Academic Guidance
Prof. Zuhong Lu from Biomedical Engineering Department for his instructions in all directions and timely help. Mr. Yunfei Bai from Biomedical Engineering Department for his practical advice and essential communication with the outside. Mr. Jinke Wang from Biomedical Engineering Department for his flawless equipment of the molecule biology lab in which part of our research took place. Mrs. Lei Huang from Biomedical Engineering Department for arranging and harmonizing some trivial matters. Chunpeng He, a doctor student from Biomedical Engineering Department for helping us to use TEM and instructing our practical skills that be involved in wet experiment. Doctor Zhigang Qu from Academy of Military Mmedical Sciences for his generously providing the RP4 plasmid. Activities Cooperation
SEU_O_China iGEM for providing support and help on project and experiment. NJU iGEM Teams for cooperating with the lecture for the human practice. And all the friends that once involved in the game, providing intelligent ideas bit by bit, that really cheers up.
Contribution
Almost all the work that we demonstrated has been done by ourselves.
Project Design &Wet Experiment
Rui, Lan and Dan did nearly all the wet experiment, including (biobrick)part design, part assembly and validation scheme design. Li Wang and Yue Hu also had attribution to the wet experiment.Yue Hu partly design the sweet gene biobrick meanwhile He Zhang took in charge of all the chemotoxis parts design. ModelThe whole conjugation model had been established by Haoruo Jia, Rui Guan and Xiao Han helped him a lot with the data processing. Human PracticeYe Ye contacted to the NJU iGEM to invited them collaborate with us to organizing lectures among the universities. She tried her best to make our team good impression to public and she made it. Li Wang was in full charge of the cards design, devoting to build reasonable and pleased rules. Cover of the cards were all designed by Hongbo Xu, who has high talents in art and majors in clinical medicine. Wiki ConstructionAll pages of this wiki was constructed by Dadi Zhao, who learned web design started from scratch in this summer. In order to show you our project vividly, he also use some JavaScript & CSS3 method trying to avoid boring word accumulation. Hand PaintingsAll the hand paintings were drawn by Hongbo Xu, and he also design our logo and mascot which had profound meaning and art value at the same time.
Help
We helped SEU_O_CHINA as below: We held a lecture on synthetic biology as human practice and invited NJU to share ideas together .  Almost all of the organizational work is done by the member of our team,such as contact to the students of NJU and arrange the time and place of the lecture. In the final stage of  experiment,we help them in their construction of standard BioBrick. For example,we provided them with the bacteria caring pSB1C3 and the expression vector for verification experiment. We are responsible for most of the health cleaning and sterilization work.
What SEU_O_China helped us can be seen here:

Members
   Yue Hu A decent girl native-born in this fascinating city, Nanjing. She is charismatic in leadership, owing her special appeal to fellows around her ,and able to promote her team members to fully develop their abilities. To insure the team’s sound operation cost this seemed a little delicate but persistent girl a vast of time and energy. As the saying goes: after the storm, we believe it is the same to her - after difficult training, the fruit of happiness will come to her eventually.
   Li Wang Stubborn is the word I would like to leave to this girl and it meets her taste as well. She is a girl who would like to spend any her owes getting what she want. (That is enough for most of our life). Her work in this game varied constantly from experiment to human practice. This girl is considered agile but sometimes seems a little reckless. During this summer, she once kindled her right hand, but fortunately, her fond on experiment wasn’t buried out…

   Shenglan Zeng An energetic girl with appreciative long hair. In the period of project completing, she devoted most of her time in the team, laborious and selfless in the game, while she also did a good job in her own curriculum. In her slim and petite figure, there is a mighty spirit wandering all the time. When we feel depressed and fatigued, her warm smile will cheer us up immediately, like a beam of light across the leaves of the tree layers.
   Xiao Han A gentle belle with a strong science background. At first sight, this slender girl from the Huai River Basin may seem quiet, but actually she is a jubilant and lively girl who will bring delight to her cooperators, forming a relaxed and cozy atmosphere, reconciling mutually conflicting opinions from different people around her and reaching an agreement of problem solving. Her illustration in aesthetics improved our wiki design, whilst her proficient skill in science is never to be neglected on the modeling.
   Ye Ye A girl good at communication. Her task is mainly in human practice. By contacting and exchanging experiences with the team from Nanjing University, she constructed the framework of this sub item. From her many friends’ view, she is an enthusiastic girl, even if first meeting with others, she can abridge the gap between unfamiliar people, promoting the harmony of the whole team.
University
Southeast University (SEU) is one of the national key universities administered directly under the Ministry of Education of China. It is also one of the first universities accredited by the State Council to determine and approve the qualifications of professors, associate professors and doctorial supervisors. It is also one of the universities of Project 211 and Program 985 that is financed by the central government to build as a world-class university.
   Southeast University is one of the oldest institutions of higher learning in China. its origin can be traced back to 1902, when it was founded as Sanjiang Normal College. Then, it evolved as: Nanjing Higher Normal School, National Southeast University and National Central University. During the nationwide restructuring of institutions of higher learning in 1952, Nanjing Institute of Technology was established on the original site of National Central University. In May 1988, the university was renamed Southeast University. And in April 2000, Nanjing Railway Medical College, Nanjing College of Communications and Nanjing Geological School were merged into the university, whose main campus is located at the center of the ancient capital city of Nanjing, a sacred place for education since the Ming Dynasty. At present, Southeast University has campuses such as Sipailou ,Jiulonghu and Dingjiaqiao, covering a total area of 427 hectares.
   Now, Southeast University has become a comprehensive university of high reputation comprised of various Schools&departments of science, engineering, art, social sciences, law, economics, management, languages, etc., with engineering as its focus. The university boasts over 34 schools or departments with 64undergraduate disciplines in all. It also has 20 post-doctoral stations, and offers 95 PhD programs and 208 Master programs; it holds a national lead in architecture, civil engineering, electronics, information technology, energy, power engineering, and transportation technology. The total number of faculty and staff is 6000, including 1300 full or associate professors, 450 doctoral supervisors, 9 academicians of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and Academy of Engineering, 28 "" Cheung Kong Scholar"" Professors. At present, the full-time students number over 27000, of whom about 10000 are postgraduates.    Southeast University encourages the school spirit of ""rigor, truthfulness, unity and diligence"", i.e., adopting the rigorous, truthful, realistic scientific attitude and working spirit of full cooperation. It has turned out more than 200000 excellent personnel, among whom there are 153 academicians. With the quality education strengthened, its graduates not only have excellent theoretical competence and practical skills, but also possess a wide range of knowledge and abilities. Its average undergraduate employment rate goes beyond 99% upon graduation.    Southeast University is one of the top 10 universities in scientific research and development in China. It has over 20 national or provincial research institutes, with a number of key research bases. It’s research fund exceeded RMB 646 million in 2007. the SEU Architecture Design and Research Institute, which is one of the few national first-class design institutes, have undertaken various major projects. SEU’s affiliated Zhongda Hospital, which was set up in 1935, is one of the first hospitals in Jiangsu Province that were assessed as ""Class A Grade 3"" hospitals by the State Ministry of Public Health.

Here we are the Super UNAM Genomics TEAM :) everybody is a hard worker
All work on this project was done by members of the UNAM_Genomics_Mexico's 2012 iGEM Team. Original constructs from which to obtain P4 gene and A3 promoter to Biobrick were supplied by Dr. Margarita Salas from Autonomous University of Madrid. Bacillus subtilis strains were provided by Dr. Ben-Yehuda from School of Medicine-IMRIC, Dr. Gabriela Olmedo from Center for Research and Advanced Studies of the National Polytechnic Institute (CINVESTAV,IPN)  Campus Irapuato and  Dr. Guillermo Gosset from Biotechnology Institute (IBT, UNAM). Supervision and direction was provided by  members of the Center for Genomic Sciences, (CCG) however all work was done by the team, during the months of May 2012 to present. Most work was developed in the CCG from National Autonomous University of México (UNAM). Part of the work with Bacillus subtillis was done in CINVESTAV Campus Irapuato. Special thanks to Amhed Missael Vargas Velazquez for his support with MATLAB®, Dr. Otto Geiger for allowing us to use its lab at CCG to work with the OR and the Sweet AND and to Dr. Gabriela Olmedo for her help with Bacillus subtilis. Also  Dr. Fernando García from The Cellular Physiology Department of UNAM that helped us with the SEM Analysis and  Alfonso Leija,PhD from the Functional Genomics of Eukaryotes Research Program  at Center of Genomic Sciences, who helped us with parts characterization.

Contributions
All of the lab work shown in the team notebook was done by Shawn and Monique. They also used Clotho and Eugene themselves, with some initial instruction from Jenhan Tao and Ernst Oberortner from the CIDAR lab .
The team mentors and adviser primarily offered instruction in protocols and troubleshooting guidance for the wet lab work conducted.
Sonya and Swati, two of the team mentors, taught Shawn and Monique the wet lab protocols and helped them troubleshoot problems with their methods (including PCR, cloning, and gel electrophoresis) throughout the summer. Sonya built the B0032 inverter.
Evan, the third team mentor, helped Monique run the characterization experiments. Specifically, he ran the flow cytometer with Monique as only graduate students and above are allowed to run the instrument independently. Monique set up the cultures and conducted the characterization experiments and analysis under Evan's guidance.
Traci, the team adviser, oversaw the team's work and experiments throughout the summer. Specifically, she taught Shawn and Monique how to design primers and run MoClo reactions. Traci also taught them some of the protocols they used in their research and helped them troubleshoot some of their PCR and cloning problems. Traci built the B0034 inverter.
The website template is from our 2011 iGEM team's wiki page ( BU Wellesley Software ). Traci edited the css file and created the new pages for this year's wiki. It was a full team effort to fill in the various Wiki pages.
Sponsors
We'd like to thank all of our sponsors for their generous support. Without the support from the following Boston University departments and various industrial companies, we never would have been able to compete in iGEM.
Thank you very much!

The idea of this project arose from countless discussions, researches and presentations in team meetings (done by team members). So was the complete planning, and realization done by the students of iGEM Bielefeld Team 2012 with some tips from the advisers to avoid problems that came up in the years before. The whole lab work was executed by the student members of the team (and really everyone had their part to do to the last day).To get this big project organized we divided the team in small subteams (operating units):

Everyone participated and helped in human practices. Robert Braun was just head and contact. In public(interviews and newspapers), our team was represented by Kevin Jarosch und Robert Braun, but everyone had their part and represented their own opinion. All funds for the project were solicited by the sponsoring team (for sure team members and advisers gave suggestions where to ask).
However, there are some people without whom we could not have done all this work. People who gave us advise, helped us out with materials or simply cheered us up during some long days in the lab. (This page is constantly updated just to make sure we won't forget anyone.)
Our Instructor Dr. Jörn Kalinowski for providing us with an own laboratory room and supporting us with paper work, scientific guidance and financing. Furthermore we could use all of his equipment and materials.
We want to thank Prof. Dr. Alfred Pühler for promoting our work and always answering our questions.
Prof. Dr. rer. nat. Erwin Flaschel for providing us with lab space. We were able to use all the fermentation equipment we needed in his Fermentation Engineering lab. As well, he helped us with the sponsoring.
Our Instructor Dr. Christian Rückert always gave great advice for our scientific problems. He helped us with ordering materials, drove for us to the Teacher´s workshop in Paris and gave a lot of helpful suggestions.
Nils Lübke and Timo Wolf as former iGEM team members helped us with their experience, listened to our endless discussions and problems during our weekly team meetings and adviced us on our public relations work.
Dominik Cholewa aided us with his knowledge considering our large-scale fermentations and various purification methods.
Thomas Hug helped us with questions about Pichia pastoris vector design and fermentation.
Michael Limberg who is sharing a lab with us and is therefore always our first try when having a question.
Dr. Marcus Persicke for measuring our LC-MS preparations and his advises
Maurice Telaar gave us pMTE cp46 His and helped us with questions about purification
Nikolas Kessler as a former iGEM team member gave us guidance especially with web and graphic design.
Armin Neshat as a former iGEM team member helped us with our everyday questions and ordered all our chemicals and primers.
Prof. Dr. Uwe Bornscheuer, leader of the working group from the Institute of Biochemistry, Dept. of Biotechnology & Enzyme Catalysis at Ernst-Moritz-Arndt-University in Greifswald (Germany), send us the sequences and plasmids containing four sequences of different laccases of Trametes versicolor and the sequence of one Pycnoporus cinnabarinus laccase.
Prof. Dr. Thomas Noll helped us finding sponsors by mediating contacts.
Thorsten Seidel for advice with GFP-linkers, helping us with A. thaliana and supplying us with some ""spare parts"".

Our Team consists of 15 dedicated undergraduate students from Bielefeld University. We are majoring in Molecular Biotechnology, Genome-Based Systems Biology, Bioinformatics, and Molecular Cell Biology. Our participation in this competition enables us to get involved in an international project, which gives us the chance to collaborate and challenge with excellent early stage researchers from all over the world. This participation results from personal and scientific interests and all our work is realized in our spare time besides the regular academic calendar. In order to realize our project, we try to maintain a high level of organization to accomplish a large amount of work. But despite all the work, we have a lot of fun.

My Studies:
Molecular Biotechnology, because it's an impressive and innovative combination of industrial production processes and research with a deeper understanding in molecular operations.
The reason why I participate in iGEM:
Taking part in iGEM is maybe the best chance to surpass the own limits and to compete with other young scientists. The greatest things about iGEM is the “spirit”, the chance to meet and get to know hundreds of young people, be part of the innovation of iGEM and to realize that all those people from around the world share the same passion. Participating in iGEM offers the chance to plan and hold an own project. I would like to learn about communication with the industries as well as the broader public. Of course I also want to expand my laboratory skills and to deepen my scientific understanding.
What I hope to achieve during working in Lab:
As many and as good as possible lab results and success in communicating our project and our result with the society?
What I do if I'm not in Lab:
For me, the best way to enjoy the few hours of leasure time is sitting in the sun at the “Siegfriedplatz” in Bielefeld. Which, to be honest, is rarely the case. Either it rains (which is nearly always the case), or, well, it rains.
What I think about safety and how I want to practise it:
Think before you act, so you can take the appriopriate steps to protect you, others and the environment. And always, always, always be careful when doing something stupid.
Preffered time to work:
The later the evening gets, the better the results. Nothing against the early bird, but I need my sleep.
""Synthetic Biology - Do I need to say more? Working in this young, aspiring and rapid growing field of life science is challenging, but also fun. Having the chance to participate in iGEM is maybe the best chance to work in Synthetic Biology being a young scientist.""
Malak Fawaz
My studies:
Genome-Based Systems Biology, because it’s an interdisciplinary field of study that combines genome research and systems biology, both of which I’m interested in!
The reason why I participated in iGEM:
iGEM is a worldwide competition in synthetic biology, which enables its participants to explore this field in a competitive and collaborative environment. It’s a great experience being part of an iGEM team :)
What I hope to achieve during working in the lab:
I hope we could produce laccases clever enough to solve our case ;)
What I do if I'm not in the lab:
It's been a while since I last had time to do something outside the lab, but I usually enjoy cooking, especially Mediterranean and Oriental food!
What I think about safety and how practice it:
Lab safety is certainly a priority when working in labs. If you’re not aware of the safety rules and guidelines, then you’ld better stay out of labs, especially when it comes to synthetic biology or GMOs!
My favorite protein
Serotonin, the happy hormone :)
My best and most productive work time:
I’m definitely a night person and a grouch in the morning. The darker it gets, the more productive I become!
""As a member of an iGEM team I hope we would be able to achieve our expected results and develop a filter system to purify wastewater with the help of synthetic biology. On the other hand, I also hope we could improve the public perception of synthetic biology and reveal the great potential of this emerging field of science.""
Miriam Fougeras
My studies:
After a practical course in the lab I decided to deepen my knowledge by going to university and studying molecular biotechnology.
The reason why I participated in iGEM:
I am taking part at iGEM to learn how to plan a reasearch project and to work in a motivated team. Especially, I am interested in meeting people from a number of different countries.
What I hope to achieve during working in the lab:
I am hoping to get more practical training in the lab and of course I hope that at least most of our experiments show meaningful results and that we can convince the committee with our project.
What I do if I'm not in the lab:
My favored free time activity is traveling. Further, I like to meet friends, go out on weekend and cook. Besides my studies I have a job as a waitress at the weekends.
What I think about safety and how I practice it:
Depends... sometimes I think Oh My Gosh, is that really necessary?! But I know that it is just for my safety... so of course I care about my safety and wear gloves, coat and safety glasses.
My favorite protein
Laccase, what else should it be?! :)
My best and most productive work time:
Lab working I like to do in the early morning. When it comes to studying our data analysis I prefer the evening. Besides, I hate to work at nights.
""I am taking part at iGEM to learn how to plan a research project and to work in a motivated team. Especially, I am interested in meeting people from a number of different countries. I am hoping to get more practical training in the lab and hopefully have fun with my and the other teams in Boston :).""
Hakan Geyik
My Studies:
I study GBSB because I am fascinated by the genomresearch.
The reason why I participate in iGEM:
IGEM rocks :)
What I hope to achieve during working in Lab:
That everything works in lab
What I do if I'm not in Lab:
Enjoying the ""beautiful"" weather of Bielefeld.
What I think about safety and how I want to practise it:
The researchers safety is important. The devices you work with could be replaced but not the person, so i care about my own and the other's safety while working at lab.
Preffered time to work:
I am no morning person
""Changing the biology of organisms using synthetic biology is changing the world to a better place""
Isabel Huber
My Studies:
Genome-Based Systems Biology
The reason why I participate in iGEM:
It’s a great opportunity to work as a team on our own project and to get to know other young scientists.
What I hope to achieve during working in Lab:
Many good results, what else ;)
What I think about safety and how I want to practise it:
It’s very important to care about and know all safety regulations because we work with S1 organisms and chemicals in the lab every day and it’s in our responsibility to use them in a manner not to harm other people, the environment or ourselves.
Preferred time to work:
Definitively a nightowl.
""It’s a great opportunity to work as a team on our own project and to get to know other young scientists. I hope to gain new experiences and knowledge in lab and around.""
Kevin Jarosch
My Studies:
Molecular Biotechnology, I think this field of study is the best combination of biochemistry, bio-organic chemistry, biological process engineering and molecular genetics.
The reason why I participate in iGEM:
To participate in iGEM is the great chance to acquire interdisciplinary skills and to realize our own project in a new and innovative sciencific field. It is a great opportunity to gain new research experiences and to get to know hundreds of interested scientists from a variety of disciplines from all over the world. Another very exciting aspect is to compete with different universities and to represent my university in an international and famous competition. And of course the FUN :-D
What I hope to achieve during working in Lab:
To produce our own proteins and to generate a functional system to degrade the microcontaminants in the water.
What I do if I'm not in Lab:
Sleeping, and working for the perfect Wiki.
What I think about safety and how I want to practise it:
Everybody is responsible for the safety in the lab. The first and improtant thing in the lab is to think about every step I want to do. It is important to know, which chemicals and organisms I want to use, and to think about which safety aspects I have to respect to protect myself, my labmates and the environment.
Preferred time to work:
All day and night long.
""The reason why I participate in iGEM is to work on our project, to improve my soft skills and to get new connections to the scientific Network. I hope to win the Main Award and an improvement of my skills.""
Derya Kirasi
My Studies:
Genome-based Systems Biology
The reason why I participate in iGEM:
The competition ""iGEM"" is one of the best opportunities to gain experience in synthetic biology.
What I hope to achieve during working in Lab:
To gain experience.
What I do if I'm not in Lab:
Talk with iGEM-Members or watching TV, meeting friends...:)
What I think about safety an how I want to practise it:
Safety is very important and everyone should know the risks.
Preferred time to work:
Later evening.
""Synthetic Biology - Do I need to say more? Working in this young, aspiring and rapid growing field of life science is challenging, but also fun. Having the chance to participate in iGEM is maybe the best chance to work in Synthetic Biology being a young scientist.""
Gabriele Kleiner
My Studies:
Molecular Biotechnology
The reason why I participate in iGEM:
In my opinion the iGEM competition offers us a possibility to plan OUR OWN project starting from an initial idea up to financial aspects and the lab work. Trough my participation I hope I will learn how to plan and to organize a project and the lab work in a team and also how to present a project (to improve my soft skills). Furthermore I think it is very interesting to get to know a lot of different scientists from all over the world to create some kind of network, which is very useful. But apart from that, one of the most important factors is also to get a lot of different experiences, to have a great time and a lot of FUN :)
What I hope to achieve during working in Lab:
I hope we will get promising results, that means that we are able to produce one or more active laccases (especially one of the bacterial ones, because it exists less knowledge about them), that we are able to immobilize them efficiently and that they will degrade the predicted substances. :)
What I do if I'm not in the Lab:
In my spare time I like to do nearly every type of sports (especially riding, swimming, handball,..), to play the piano and to meet friends to cook, watch movies, go to parties and so on :) I am also very interested in photography, but at the moment I haven’t got the time to focus on this hobby ;)
What I think about safety an how I want to practise it:
It’s difficult to write about security in laboratories in a few sentences. I think it’s obvious that security is very important and everyone has to keep in mind that he is not only responsible for himself but also for all the other people. So it is necessary to follow all the rules in laboratories and to think about all risks of an experiment before starting it.
Preferred time to work:
Doesn't matter ;)
""In my opinion the iGEM competition offers us a possibility to plan OUR OWN project starting from an initial idea up to financial aspects and the lab work. Trough my participation I hope I will learn how to plan and to organize a project and the lab work in a team and also how to present a project. ""
Nadine Legros
My Studies:
Molecular Biotechnology, because of it's interdisciplinary. I wanted to study something with both biology, excessively genetics and chemistry and I'm also interested in informatics and physics.
The reason why I participate in iGEM:
I love to possibility to plan and operate our own project. To get in contact with other international teams and to work for ourselves. I wish to learn something about organising new projects and about interacting in a team, in which everyone has the same goal. I want to use iGEM to improve my soft skills and to learn new interesting methods.
What I hope to achieve during working in Lab:
Great results of course. And fun, even if something does not work... we'll find a way.
What I do if I'm not in the Lab:
Sports, I like do go mountain-biking, swimming, doing archery, or just running trough nature, if I can find some time between lab, working an learning. I also would like to paint a picture again, but this will have to wait.
What I think about safety an how I want to practise it:
It's quite important and everybody should know what she or he is doing when working in a laboratory.
Preferred time to work:
If I'm able to get enough sleep definitely someone who likes to work early in the morning. The Lab is quite nice when everybody is still sleeping.
My favourite laboratory equipment:
UV-table it's making things glow.
My favourite protein:
GFP, RFP and everything colourful.
And my favourite organism:
Hansenula polymorpha – it hates me, but I love it anyway.
""I love to possibility to plan and operate our own project, to get in contact with other international teams and to work for our selves. I wish to learn something about organising new projects and about interacting in a team, in which everyone has the same goal. I want to use iGEM to improve my soft skills and to learn new interesting methods.""
Moritz Müller
My Studies:
Molecular Biotechnology, because it's biology and application in one.
The reason why I participate in iGEM:
to broaden my horizon, meet clever people & have a lot of fun.
What I hope to achieve during working in Lab:
That even setbacks lead to better results.
What I do if I'm not in Lab:
My band, Jeet Kune Do
What I think about safety an how I want to practise it:
Better be safe than sorry – history can tell what happens if the wrong organism is in the right place.
Preferred time to work:
I like to start early, take a break mid-day (especially in summer) and then continue work ‘til night
""Today biology is known to build the smallest machines and tools, named enzymes and proteins. Synthetic biology is going to make this usable and controllable by mankind. It's time to get the 10-100 kDa wrenches working!""
Saskia Scheibler
My Studies:
Molecular Cell Biology - Because cells rule!
The reason why I participate in iGEM:
I enjoy being able to plan and carry out a whole project independently with other students.
What I hope to achieve during working in Lab:
To learn some new methods, to feel successful in the end and of course to have fun and many many active and happy laccases.
What I do if I'm not in Lab:
I´m baking. :)
What I think about safety an how I want to practice it:
Of course safety is one of the most important aspects in the laboratory. I do think that everyone is able to read safety instructions but it is a lot harder to also practice them. This is what I am setting high value on, things such as wearing gloves all the time but taking them off when touching something being not lab equipment or label everything correct and properly and and and..
Preferred time to work:
I can do both but I usually get an energy boost at about 11 pm ;)
""I enjoy being able to plan and carry out a whole project independently with other students. I hope to learn some new methods, to feel successful in the end and of course to have fun.""
Julia Schirmacher
My Studies:
My studies are „Genome Based System Biology“ and I have choosen this because I am interested in an interdisciplinary research between genomics and computational system biology.
The reason why I participate in iGEM:
Synthetic biology is a young research field and it is great to be a part of it. It gives the opportuity to work on this field with an high motivated and selforganised team.
What I hope to achieve during working in Lab:
I hope to get some satisfacted results and to colaborate with other teams world wide. Maybe our system will help to eliminate water contamination and that these ideas will produce a lot of food for thought.
What I think about safety and how I want to practise it:
The personal laboratory safty and the laboratory security are two very important things. I wear a lab coat, gloves and security glasses where it is necessay and protect myself and others. It is important to confidence in others that they will also pay attencion in safty and security. Because we are working with some toxic components and GVOs.
What is your fovourite laboratory device:
The PCR cycler is my favorite device. We are in an inner relationship, some thimes we are in love and sometimes in trouble, like a married couple.
What is your fovourite organisms:
I like water bears, because it is a cute organisms and I am impressed by the ability to cryptobiosis.
Preferred time to work:
I like to work around the clock, sometimes late and sometimes in the early morning.
""Learning from others, show what I can do and how to work and comunicate in a team with many different characters is the best experience I get of iGEM.
Julia Voß
My Studies:
Genome based Systems Biologie, because it is always important to look at and to understand the whole system.
The reason why I participate in iGEM:
I think iGEM is a great chance to improve our own skills in- and outside the lab. Finding sponsors and to go up to different companies to find co-operation partners is a very interesting experience.
What I hope to achieve during working in Lab:
I hope we get many positiv results and find a way to install our immobilized laccases - theoretically.
What I think about safety an how I want to practise it:
One of the most important aspects in the laboratory of course is  safety. To know that there are safty instructions is not enough to adopt them everyday is the real complicated part, but very important.
Preferred time to work:
If I'm needed, I'm there!
""To realize your own project in a group of totally different persons is wonderful and a great chance to learn a lot from each other. That´s why I think iGEM is such a interesting and important experience.""
Agatha Walla
My Studies:
Molecular Cell Biology, because it gives me the opportunity to gain as much practical experience in the lab as possible.
The reason why I participate in iGEM:
Because I want to have a nice time with people I like and who are interested in the same topics as I am. Of course I wish that our team can achieve as much as possible, but I want to finish this project knowing that we all worked together, gave our best, learned a lot and had a nice time.
What I hope to achieve during working in Lab:
Satisfied Laccases that will allow us to get good results ;)
What I do if I'm not in Lab:
Cooking and eating. Sometimes the other way round or even simultaneously.
What I think about safety and how I want to practise it:
Lab safety is a very important topic. Everyone should be aware of safety when entering the lab and check for example if there is any food or water that should be left outside. Reading the safety instructions of chemicals and knowing how to dispose them properly are also basics. In my opinion one of the most significant aspects about lab safety is to leave the working area in a safe and tidy state.
Preferred time to work:
I like so start early because it makes me excited knowing that I already did something while other people are sleeping. Working in the evening is also fun. But that makes me need a nap in the afternoon.
""The reason why I participate in iGEM is that it gives young scientists the oppurtunity to deepen their knowledge in this very new field of synthetic biology. I hope that we get as much out of it as we can as a team.""
Sebastian Wiebe
My Studies:
Genome-Based Systems Biology, because the wish to understand a whole system is a suitable kind of insanity for me.
The reason why I participate in iGEM:
There is no better way to learn, than to work on a manageable project by choice.
What I hope to achieve during working in Lab:
I hope that either our experiments verify our model, or lead us to right calculations.
What I do if I'm not in Lab:
When I'm not in the Lab, I drink some maté-tea,  ride my mountain bike, chop trees, play my Violin or my Bass and when I have no idea I play video games.
And my favourite organism:
Me, because I couldn't imagine the world without me.
Preferred time to work:
I like it, when the floors are dark, and you think, you are alone in the Lab. But couriosly I work mostly at the same time like all the others.
""There is no better way to learn, than to work on a manageable project by choice.""

Attributions and Contributions
Computational team
We developed several software applications and deployed them with iGEM teams, high school students, and the local community at large. While this was a team effort, we point out key contributors to each of the applications below:
SynBio Search
SynBio Search was inspired by our participatory design sessions with the BU iGEM team, Robert Kincaid, David Olsen, and Natalie Kuldell. The application was designed by the team during our brainstorming and implemented by Linda Ding with the help of Chelsea Hoover.
MoClo Planner
The MoClo Planner was inspired by our participatory design session with the BU iGEM team, Robert Kincaid, David Olsen, and Natalie Kuldell. The application was designed by the team during our brainstorming and implemented by Kara Lu, Nahum Seifeselassie, Kathy Liu, and Casey Grote with the help of Consuelo Valdes.
Outreach: SynFlo and Peer Mentorship
SynFlo was inspired by our experience in the BioBuilder workshop conducting the E. chromi experiment, our participatory design session with the BU iGEM team, Robert Kincaid, David Olsen, and Natalie Kuldell, and research on related work. The application was designed by the Wendy Xu and Kimberly Chang and the team during our brainstorming and implemented by Nicole Francisco, Kimberly Chang, and Wendy Xu with the help of Consuelo Valdes.  In addition, the Wellesley HCI Lab mentored a rising senior in high school and presented in the Wellesley College Science Center Summer Poster Session.
The iGEM Team Wiki
The iGEM Team Wiki was designed by Kara Lu and implemented by the team.

Attribution and Contributions
Tokyo NoKoGen 2012 is built up of 22 students, 1 advisors, and 3 instructors. Student members through discussion with the advisors and instructors decided our project concepts. All laboratory works were only done by student members in the laboratories at the Department of Biotechnology and Life Science, Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology. Our wiki was designed by Ryutaro Tsukuda and constructed by lab members. Sponsors only supported by providing laboratories to work at, experimental materials, and funding. All team members very much enjoyed doing our project and greatly appreciate Assist. Prof. Ferri, Prof. Ikebukuro, and Prof. Sode for all their supports.

The students of the BYU 2012 iGEM team would like to thank the tireless contributions of our dedicated adviser Dr. Julianne Grose .
We specifically thank John Dallon and Dallin Durfee for help with the math modeling.
We also recognize the help and guidance of our advisors, Dr. Sean Warnick and Dr. David Kooyman .
We would also like to recognize Dr Hazelbauer’s lab at the University of Missouri for the TrZ and OmpC-lacZ constructs.
We thank the Brigham Young University College of Life Sciences , Microbiology and Molecular Biology Department for funding our registration fees and resesarch, and for providing a laboratory and the necessary materials. We also thank New England BioLabs for providing most of the enzymes and reagents.
We recognize the generous donation of software by Matlab . Free access to Matlab greatly enhanced our mathematical modeling.
What we, the students, are responsible for
Although Dr. Grose oversaw the design and implementation of our project, it is important to note that we the students were involved at all steps including the invention, design and actual wet-lab work necessary to create our parts.
The students of the BYU 2012 iGEM team are responsible for all of the lab work, experiments and data collected. They are also responsible for the analysis and modeling of the data. Any contributions to the modeling are specified on the modeling page. The project ideas belong to the entire team.
A special thanks to Eric Jones and John Shumway for the creation and upkeep of this wikisite.

The design of all the biobricks and the gene systems for the production of the enzymes both for E.coli and R. opacus were developed by the under-graduated team members. Also, the laboratory work of culture of the bacteria, making competent cells, transformations, mini –preps, digestions, between others were done by the team. Our main advisor, MSc. Alejandro Hernández looked over the gene system designed and made some suggestions and corrections on them. Additionally he provided great part of the reagents and laboratory instruments used for the lab work.
The MSc. Geaovanny Garro; another team advisor, helped us in the development and presentation of the student project made by three members of the team, to present in the university for funding of genes synthesis. The PhD. Miguel Rojas, our last advisor helped us with the organization in the Bio-Entrepreneurship Forum and with this participation of the group; we got to be in the finals for the contest “Yo Emprendedor”.
The molecular laboratory in the Center of Investigation in Biotechnology (CIB), of the Faculty of Biology in the Costa Rican Institute of Technology (ITCR) was our main host for all the laboratory labors. Most of the equipment for the processes; like the thermocycler PCRs, electrophoresis chambers, laminar flow chambers, shakers, between others, were borrowed from this laboratory and the teaching laboratory of faculty. Besides, some of the strains of the bacteria E. coli, the pGLO genes with other reagents were given by the molecular biology teaching laboratory of the faculty. The other strains and reagents were either purchased with money given by the university with funs of the VIESA (Vicerrectoría de Vida Estudiantil y Servicios Académicos), with the money gained in the participation of the Business Idea Fair or given by the laboratory Center of Investigation and Microbiological and Chemical Services (CEQIATEC) with the collaboration of the MSc. Fabiola Jiménez.

Undergraduates
Adam Cerini:
The organism “Adam cerini” is a species of civil engineering student. The Cooper Union is his natural habitat, although he has been observed to migrate to Huntington, NY during the summer months. He appears to have matured to the “sophomore” level. One marked feature of Cerini is his intelligence, a characteristic shared by many species in the engineering family. This feature is suspected to be the cause of his interests in civil engineering, architecture, biochemistry, nanotechnology, environmental science, and biomimicry. Cerini has been shown to undertake complex projects of various types and levels of success, such as mimicking cuttlefish camouflage with LCD’s, constructing a marimba from PVC pipes, designing a bamboo hut for refugees, building an electronic game via breadboards, composing electronic music, and most recently, genetically modifying bacteria for iGEM.
Marjana Chowdhury:
Despite being from the bustling streets of New York City, Marjana was born to live in the wild. This nature lover and rising sophomore intends to major in Environmental Biology at Columbia University. In the past, Marjana's research has scaled a size spectrum ranging from immense invasive species to minuscule endangered species. As part of the Columbia-Cooper iGEM team, she is excited about her newest and smallest challenge yet, microorganisms.
Ciera Lowe:
Ciera is a rising junior at The Cooper Union majoring in chemical engineering with a minor in biomedical engineering. She joined the iGEM team because this competition provides an amazing opportunity to gain hands on experience in synthetic biology, an exciting field full of potential to improve the world we live in. In addition to her studies, Ciera keeps busy by playing foosball on Cooper’s newly acquired table, playing basketball with Cooper’s women’s team or organizing events with the engineering student council and Cooper’s National Society of Black Engineers chapter.
Anna Mai:
Anna Mai is a rising junior majoring in chemical engineering at Columbia University, with a minor in environmental engineering. She joined IGEM because it presented an interesting medium for interacting with engineers around the world and providing hands on experience in the highly applicable field of synthetic biology. In her spare time she enjoys playing ultimate Frisbee, building paper crafts, and serenading her neighbors (not well).
Yuta Makita:
Yuta Makita is a rising sophomore at the Cooper Union. He is studying Chemical Engineering and has joined the iGEM team with an interest in research based study, the process of synthetic biology and the microscopic world. In addition to his academic studies, he enjoys taking part in orchestra related activities by playing the viola.
Nicholas Mannarino:
Nicholas Mannarino is a rising sophomore at The Cooper Union. He is studying chemical engineering, with a hope to specialize in biomedical engineering and biotechnology. He joined IGEM because it seemed like a great way to spend a summer getting acquainted with a field he is interested in. In his spare time, Nicholas enjoys playing the guitar and long-distance running.
Aakash Mansukhani:
When he’s not obsessively watching American Idol videos or playing tunes on his guitar, Aakash Mansukhani studies chemical engineering at Columbia University. As a rising sophomore, Aakash hopes that participating in IGEM will help him learn more about how principles from chemical engineering and synthetic biology can be combined to program bacteria. In his free time, Aakash loves to sing and reinvent pop songs by putting his own acoustic spin on them.
Joeseph Mercedes:
Joseph Mercedes is a rising sophomore at The Cooper Union. He is majoring in Electrical Engineering. Although iGEM isn’t directly related to his major, it seems like a great opportunity to broaden his knowledge in another field and unify multiple engineering disciplines. In his spare time, Joe enjoys playing tennis and billiards.
Steven Neuhaus:
Steven Neuhaus is a rising sophomore who studies chemical engineering at The Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art. He’s quite fond of the idea of using little things to solve big problems, and joined iGEM because it provides a tremendous opportunity to do just that (and also time to play in the lab!). Steven also enjoys pointing out that writing about oneself in the third person is extremely awkward, is interested in most things that are interesting, and if you show him something cool, he’s usually more than glad to run with it.
Kirsten Nicassio:
Kirsten Nicassio just finished her freshman year at The Cooper Union. She is majoring in chemical engineering, with an intended math minor. She joined IGEM because of interest in the field of biomedical engineering. In her spare time, Kirsten enjoys reading, knitting, and swimming.
Udochukwu (Ud) Okorafor:
Ud Okorafor is a rising senior at Columbia University. He is majoring in chemical engineering and has interests in protein engineering and pharmaceuticals. He joined IGEM because he enjoyed the research he had done previously on genetic engineering of E. coli. In his spare time, he enjoys playing various sports, reading science fiction books, and watching movies.
Saimon Sharif:
Saimon is a rising sophomore at The Cooper Union. He is studying Chemical Engineering. He joined IGEM because it gives him the opportunity to apply engineering and creativity to biology. In his spare time, Saimon enjoys listening to alternative rock and watching science fiction television shows.
Jeffery Xu:
Jeffrey is a rising sophomore Chemical Engineering student at Cooper and an aspiring chemical/biomedical engineer. He hopes to discover a lot about current research and advancements in the biomedical field, and believes IGEM offers many opportunities to learn from and contribute to. During the (little) time he has when he is not breathing chemistry and understanding the vast enigmas of the applied sciences, he enjoys playing the violin, traveling and catching up with friends.
Vincent Xu:
Vincent is a rising senior at Columbia University majoring in chemical engineering and minoring in applied mathematics. He is more interested in computational modeling than lab work and has been doing research in the applied math department since the summer of his freshman year. He decided to join IGEM because he thinks that it’s a good chance to learn something about biology, which is a subject he hasn’t studied since high school, and to get involved in any computational or modeling work. In addition to enjoying popular activities that college students engage in, such as eating and sleeping, Vincent does ballroom dancing.
High School Students
Richard Shi:
Richard Shi is a high school research student at Jericho High School. He had previously studied and written a paper based on the Dye Sensitized Solar Cell at Farmingdale University. He joined iGEM to vary his exposure to different sciences (moving from the engineering sciences to synthetic biology) and hopes to collect data for the upcoming Intel STS competition. He hopes to bring much to the table, despite being in high school.

(alias: Self-sacrificing)
Hi I have just finished second year of medical school. I've been addicted to iGEM since my first steps to university but only this year I have had a chance to be the part of this incredible team. After accidentally burning our precious bacteria while spreading the plate, mates got used to teasing me by calling ‘Bakteri Külbastı Ustası’ which in english means ‘Bacteria Cutlet Chef’. I’ve gained so much experience with iGEM, especially it woke up the spirit of endless research and explore in me. Besides I’m fanatical about astronomy and everything classic; books, music, clothes and etc.

I’m a third grade medical student, what i believe in life is just trying and not to  get down so we can see the light at the end of the tunnel. I have been planning to specialize at neurogenetics so that i could make my dream happen, i’m glad to be the part of this organization and willing to meet other iGEMers.

Hopeless Case
Hi! I am second year medical student. Participating in iGEM is one of the greatest personal experiences I’ve ever had. The time I’ve spent during the lab works and other activities was very instructive for me in every sense.  Apart from science, music is an important part of my life. I've been playing the violin for 11 years in different orchestras.  I would like to thank our whole team for the fairy-tale summer and the great time we had together. And of course special thanks to our advisors and instructors for all their patience:)

Hi there, I’m second year student at medical school. My love to genetics brought me to iGEM. I usually deal with software and hardware tools of team. I’m also always responsible for making a list of lacking and necessary lab equipments. I like cooking but can’t resist eating. I get extreme adrenaline by riding my motorcycle.

I'm second year medical student. My lessons and medicine are pleasure for me.I find Synthetic Biology really challenging as it is limitless and involved in every major. I joined iGEM to learn more things about this developing branch of science. I take care of me and my team spending useful time in lab. Most of all I like making competent cell. Of course I have hobbies outside of this; swimming, watching movies and discovering new places are just some of them!

Hi! I’m second year medical student. I like my lessons without exceptions. I get excited by learning new things, especially in branches of science. I guess that’s why I take so much pleasure of iGEM studies (researches, experiments etc.). Furthermore, I think youths will achieve such incredible points in SynBio and in science as long as they are encouraged. I will try to be together with those young scientists which work with endless desire in every opportunity.

Third year medical student. In my high school years I was always interested in genetics and molecular biology. So when I heard about iGEM competition it didn’t take a long time for me to make a decision. . . and I had a privelege to participate in it. For me iGEM is an amazing experience where you can learn team work, lab work, social work and other intresting stuff of work. Also iGEM is a great opportunity to spend your summer with a lot of fun and benefit.

Hi! I am second class medical student at Fatih University. This means, I’m only 4 years away from my biggest dream to become a doctor:) I am a fierce fan of playing and watching football since my childhood. I have an additional favorite hobby since last year – playing the Ney (a turkish wind instrument). Being part of the Fatih-Medical team was my greatest  scientific experience but apart from all the science my biggest profit while working at this project was to have learned how to become a real team. I want to thank all my team mates for the amazing time we had together!

Parts for a reliable and field ready biosensing platform
Implementation of biosensors in real world situations has been made difficult by the unpredictable and non-quantified outputs of existing solutions, as well as a lack of appropriate storage, distribution and utilization systems. This leaves a large gap between a simple, functional sensing mechanism and a fully realised product that can be used in the field. We aim to bridge this gap at all points by developing a standardised ratiometric luciferase output in a Bacillus chassis. This output can be linked up with prototyped instrumentation and software for obtaining reliable quantified results. Additionally, we have reduced the specialized requirements for the storage and distribution of our bacteria by using Bacillus' sporulation system. To improve the performance of our biosensing platform we have genetically modified Bacillus’ germination speed. Lastly, we demonstrated the robustness of our system by testing it with a new fluoride riboswitch, providing the opportunity to tackle real life problems.

iGEM Prizes
All teams are eligible for special prizes at the Jamborees. more... To help the judges, please indicate if you feel you should be evaluated for any of the following special prizes:
√Best Human Practice Advance
√Best Experimental Measurement
Best Model
Please explain briefly why you should receive any of these special prizes:
Best Human Practice Advance:
We feel that we deserve this prize for three reasons:
We explored the impacts, *both positive and negative*, of synthetic biology as a solution to real world problems, through interviewing professionals working in a relevant field, namely the impact of arsenic water contamination in Bangladesh.
We recognized existing problems with the way the current direction of synthetic. On going through the registry we found that most of the characterization data for biosensing parts is often neither comparable nor replicable. We have worked to solve this issue, for example with our ratiometric dual channel output.
*Our project doesn’t stop here*, in Chanel number 6 ( Team:Cambridge/HumanPractices/FutureDirections ) we considered the future implications and technological applications of our project, as well as the means by which it could be improved by subsequent users. We feel that the end to an iGEM project should not be the conclusion of an idea, but the start of it.
Best BioBrick Measurement Approach:
It is absolutely vital that a quantitative, numerical, robust, and flexible measurement approach exists to relay information to a user that is an accurate representation of the input processed by a biological device. Working from these principles, the following was done:
We designed and built Biologger, a *cheap, arduino-based, fully functional automatic rotary device* that has an incorporated ratiolumnometer
Our project is entirely open-sourced and open-platform. We have published source code for the two applications which serve to operate the device, one for PCs and the other for Android devices, as well as the open source circuit design that provides this ratiometric reading. Furthermore, the Android app is able to receive its data wirelessly, which we feel is a great advance in BioBrick measurement.
Our dual-channel luciferase reporter was successfully tested with a dilution series of E.coli transformed with the Lux Operon (under pBAD) biobrick (Part  BBa_K325909) of the Cambridge iGEM 2010 team. It can detect, with good accuracy, both different light intensities, as well as the percentages of blue or orange frequencies in a sample.
Our device was successfully tested using artificial light to detect different frequencies (colours) as well.
Having done all the above, we believe that this fully open-sourced instrumentation kit (mechanical) chassis, electronics, software code), estimated at *$35.00* (or $85.00 if a Bluetooth modem is required), is a complete BioBrick measurement solution for any and all BioBricks with a light output.

Team_Parts
To help the judges evaluate your parts, please identify 3 of your parts that you feel are best documented and are of the highest quality.
Best new BioBrick part (natural)
BBa_K911003
Best new BioBrick part (engineered)
BBa_K911004
Best improved part(s): None
List any other parts you would like the judges to examine: BBa_K911001 , BBa_K911009 , BBa_K911008
Please explain briefly why the judges should examine these other parts:
Magnesium Sensitive Riboswitch BBa_K911001
As a riboswitch sensing construct, this part is an entirely new type of biosensor (along with the fluoride construct) that could potentially change the way we think about designing input genetic circuits. Unlike the fluoride riboswitch, it is a derepression system and therefore serves to demonstrate the principle that riboswitches can be used regardless of whether they turn on or off their reporter.
Fluorescent ratiometric construct for standardizing promoter output BBa_K911009
Fluorescence is a major cornerstone for biosensors in the registry, however, most parts do not involve the use of a ratiometric output, which has been shown in the literature to provide much more reliable and meaningful data. This part not only furthers the development of ratiometric measurements in molecular biology but due to the choice of promoters and terminators it can be used to characterize the difference in activity between E. coli and B. Subtilis
Fast Germination (B. subtilis) BBa_K911008
This part is entirely novel for the registry and fully utilizes the recombination machinery inherent in the Bacillus chassis. Have spores that can germinate at a faster rate is certainly a worthy achievement and could help with experiments with B. Subtilis that any future iGEM teams may wish to perform.

I have just finished the second year of Engineering and I am planning to continue specialising in Electrical and Information Sciences. I have always been interested in integrating engineering into biological applications and thus I find iGEM as an excellent educational experience. Apart from science and engineering, I enjoy swimming (preferably in the Mediterranean) and hiking.

I spent the last year doing biochemistry and neuroscience, and will be doing more of that as a part II PDN (Physiology, Development and Neuroscience) student next year, with my main interest in developmental neurobiology. But SynBio is exciting too- so is photography, and baking ;)
Does the picture not tell you everything you need to know?
I have a particular interest in physiology and neuroscience, going into part II PDN (physiology, development and neuroscience) next year. Molecular biology is therefore not really my area of expertise, but I'm keen to learn and I have a steady pipetting hand.
I finished my third year Engineering for the Life Sciences course this year and will be continuing with this for my masters year in October. This is my first major foray into experimental biology and am keen to get as much engineering into the project as possible!
I'm a biologist with an interest in cell biology and biochemistry, although next year I'm specialising in plant sciences which is also very cool. Outside of science I like lots of samba percussion and all kinds of outdoor pursuits.
I'm a biologist mostly interested in cell biology and biochemistry, but also in pathological processes and viruses, both as pathogens and as potential chassis for synthetic systems. Next year I'm going on to a third (and fourth) year of biochemistry, by which point I hope to be able to pipette with two Gilsons simultaneously.

Parts for a reliable and field ready biosensing platform
Implementation of biosensors in real world situations has been made difficult by the unpredictable and non-quantified outputs of existing solutions, as well as a lack of appropriate storage, distribution and utilization systems. This leaves a large gap between a simple, functional sensing mechanism and a fully realised product that can be used in the field. We aim to bridge this gap at all points by developing a standardised ratiometric luciferase output in a Bacillus chassis. This output can be linked up with prototyped instrumentation and software for obtaining reliable quantified results. Additionally, we have reduced the specialized requirements for the storage and distribution of our bacteria by using Bacillus' sporulation system. To improve the performance of our biosensing platform we have genetically modified Bacillus’ germination speed. Lastly, we demonstrated the robustness of our system by testing it with a new fluoride riboswitch, providing the opportunity to tackle real life problems.

iGEM Prizes
All teams are eligible for special prizes at the Jamborees. more... To help the judges, please indicate if you feel you should be evaluated for any of the following special prizes:
√Best Human Practice Advance
√Best Experimental Measurement
Best Model
Please explain briefly why you should receive any of these special prizes:
Best Human Practice Advance:
We feel that we deserve this prize for three reasons:
We explored the impacts, *both positive and negative*, of synthetic biology as a solution to real world problems, through interviewing professionals working in a relevant field, namely the impact of arsenic water contamination in Bangladesh.
We recognized existing problems with the way the current direction of synthetic. On going through the registry we found that most of the characterization data for biosensing parts is often neither comparable nor replicable. We have worked to solve this issue, for example with our ratiometric dual channel output.
*Our project doesn’t stop here*, in Chanel number 6 ( Team:Cambridge/HumanPractices/FutureDirections ) we considered the future implications and technological applications of our project, as well as the means by which it could be improved by subsequent users. We feel that the end to an iGEM project should not be the conclusion of an idea, but the start of it.
Best BioBrick Measurement Approach:
It is absolutely vital that a quantitative, numerical, robust, and flexible measurement approach exists to relay information to a user that is an accurate representation of the input processed by a biological device. Working from these principles, the following was done:
We designed and built Biologger, a *cheap, arduino-based, fully functional automatic rotary device* that has an incorporated ratiolumnometer
Our project is entirely open-sourced and open-platform. We have published source code for the two applications which serve to operate the device, one for PCs and the other for Android devices, as well as the open source circuit design that provides this ratiometric reading. Furthermore, the Android app is able to receive its data wirelessly, which we feel is a great advance in BioBrick measurement.
Our dual-channel luciferase reporter was successfully tested with a dilution series of E.coli transformed with the Lux Operon (under pBAD) biobrick (Part  BBa_K325909) of the Cambridge iGEM 2010 team. It can detect, with good accuracy, both different light intensities, as well as the percentages of blue or orange frequencies in a sample.
Our device was successfully tested using artificial light to detect different frequencies (colours) as well.
Having done all the above, we believe that this fully open-sourced instrumentation kit (mechanical) chassis, electronics, software code), estimated at *$35.00* (or $85.00 if a Bluetooth modem is required), is a complete BioBrick measurement solution for any and all BioBricks with a light output.
Back to wiki
Team_Parts
To help the judges evaluate your parts, please identify 3 of your parts that you feel are best documented and are of the highest quality.
Best new BioBrick part (natural)
BBa_K911003
Best new BioBrick part (engineered)
BBa_K911004
Best improved part(s): None
List any other parts you would like the judges to examine: BBa_K911001 , BBa_K911009 , BBa_K911008
Please explain briefly why the judges should examine these other parts:
Magnesium Sensitive Riboswitch BBa_K911001
As a riboswitch sensing construct, this part is an entirely new type of biosensor (along with the fluoride construct) that could potentially change the way we think about designing input genetic circuits. Unlike the fluoride riboswitch, it is a derepression system and therefore serves to demonstrate the principle that riboswitches can be used regardless of whether they turn on or off their reporter.
Fluorescent ratiometric construct for standardizing promoter output BBa_K911009
Fluorescence is a major cornerstone for biosensors in the registry, however, most parts do not involve the use of a ratiometric output, which has been shown in the literature to provide much more reliable and meaningful data. This part not only furthers the development of ratiometric measurements in molecular biology but due to the choice of promoters and terminators it can be used to characterize the difference in activity between E. coli and B. Subtilis
Fast Germination (B. subtilis) BBa_K911008
This part is entirely novel for the registry and fully utilizes the recombination machinery inherent in the Bacillus chassis. Have spores that can germinate at a faster rate is certainly a worthy achievement and could help with experiments with B. Subtilis that any future iGEM teams may wish to perform.

Please provide the link to that page: Page name: Team:Cambridge/Safety
Attribution and Contributions
For iGEM 2012 the description of each project must clearly attribute work done by the team and distinguish it from work done by others, including the host labs, advisors, and instructors.
Please provide the link to that page, or comments in the box below: Page name: Team:Cambridge/Attributions
Comments
If there is any other information about your project you would like to highlight for the judges, please provide a link to your wiki page here: Team:Cambridge/Overview/DesignProcess
Attributions
Please see below for the attributions of work carried out as part of our project.
Sporage and Distribution
The fast promoter swap over strains we used in sporage and distribution were developed based on work by Peter Setlow from the Setlow lab at the University of Connecticut (see references in the project section). Furthermore Barbara and Peter Setlow sent us the two E. coli plasmids used for transformation of B. Subtilis as well as the finalised spores we used in testing the construct. They also provided us with information on sporulation and germination protocols and help with designing primers for biobricking the part.
Paul Mallaband and Stuart Bell from the team made up sporulation and germination medium and carried out imaging of the spores. They also carried out all relevant pcr, gibson and restriction ligation reactions to make a biobrick of the part.
Paul Grant from the Haseloff lab was instrumental in helping with imaging spores and gave advice on staining, slide preparation and microscopy.
Instrumentation
Andreas Petrides from the team led the development of the instrumentation kit along with Paul Mallaband. Electronics and Arduino code was tackled by Andreas, python code by Paul whilst both took part in the mechanical design and sourcing of materials. The testing of the instrumentation was done by Andreas with the aid of Thomas Whittaker who prepared the biological samples.
The python code was based on that submitted at http://www.blendedtechnologies.com/realtime-plot-of-arduino-serial-data-using-python/231 . All arduino code was developed by Andreas and Paul. The android application was implemented by Andreas, based on Amarino projects' open-source code (General Public License).
Mr. Tim Love from the engineering department gave advice on software design and the Engineering department helped with supplying some of the materials required. The actual assembly of the kit was done entirely by Andreas and Paul.
Ribosense
The fluoride riboswitch, with β-galactosidase reporter, was generously supplied, both in plasmid form, and as transformed cells, by the Breaker laboratory (See references in the project page as well as the special thanks page) at the University of Yale.
The plasmid supplied was then transformed into 168 strain B. subtilis, and Top10 E. coli, by Jolyon Martin from the team. He also carried out the β-galactosidase and Miller Assays.
The magnesium riboswitch was amplified up, using primers of our own design, from a prepared B. subtilis genome sample. This sample was provided by PJ Steiner of the Haseloff lab. Oliver Meacock, from the team, then pieced this amplified DNA into pJS130, a shuttle vector also provided by PJ Steiner. Oliver Meacock also carried out the characterisation assay for the magnesium riboswitch.
All relevant primers for each riboswitch were designed by Jolyon Martin and Oliver Meacock in parallel. All PCR reactions, restriction digests, and other experiments using these parts were carried our by the pair.
Ratiometrica
James Brown from the Haseloff Lab, Cambridge has offered us invaluable advice in collecting and analysing data from our ratiometric fluorescent construct.
PJ Steiner from the Haseloff Lab has provided the original E. coli and B. subtilis shuttle vector pJS130 on which we worked.
Paul Mallaband, Emmy Tsang and Thomas Whittaker from the team designed and assembled the final ratiometric fluorescent construct using PCR and Gibson assembly. The component biobricks (other than the backbone) came from the Registry's Spring Distribution Kit. We designed the original primers for Gibson and ligation, optimised the PCR, gel and PCR extraction, and Gibson assembly protocols, and tested the construct.
Fernan Federici from the Haseloff Lab provided the original mOrange DNA template, while the fischeri LuxBrick (K325909) is from the Parts Registry. Tom and Emmy from the team have assembled the construct using Gibson assembly and PCR.
Tom from the team has designed the harveii Lux-mOrange2 construct, which was then synthesised and codon optimised by DNA 2.0.

Hi! We are the University of Leicester iGEM Team, a group of Biologists, Chemists and a Computer Scientist, all focused on degrading polystyrene.
The team consists of a computer scientist (Emily), two organic chemists (Reema and Idres) , one main stream biological scientist (Christopher), two geneticists (Anthony and Nathan), and three biochemists (William, Luke and Philip). The whole team were inducted into the Genetics Department at the University of Leicester. This means everybody is cleared to work in the lab and all of us can contribute to the hands-on experiments.

Where we're from
We're from the University of Leicester, located in the UK. The University was founded in 1921 and gained  University Status by Royal Charter in 1957. It is perhaps most famous for the discovery of DNA fingerprinting by Professor Sir Alec Jeffreys FRS (one of our generous sponsors!). It is also home to the Genetics Education Network for Innovation and Exellence (GENIE), the UK's Centre for Excellence in Teaching and Learning in Genetics.

30th August: Started work on the 3rd mechanism using TMS as a solvent.
5th September: Looked at a 4th mechanism involving the dehyrdration of the H-C bond in mechanism 3.
11th September: Worked on the rate laws for the mechanisms.
13th September: Looked into using radiation to break individual bonds, until realized the full mechanism needed to be finalized. Continued to work through and finish the 3rd mechanism so the gas phase kinetics could be applied for the radiation.
14th September: Drafted a new mechanism.
18th September: Looked over mechanism 4. It seems viable. Researching into inorganic methods. Drafted a rough mechanism but needs improvements from yesterday. Discussed ideas with Reema; a double bonded compound needs to be further reduced down.
19th September: Drawn up mechanisms 1, 2, 3 and 4 on chembiodraw. And drawn up mechanism 5 to as much as can be done.
20th September: Mechanism 5 was completed
21th September: Fixed errors associated with  mechanism 5. Checked over work done by Reema Naran
24th September: Received an email back from an organic lecturer, Dr Andrew Jamieson. He gave us constructive feedback and has shown us that our work needs improving. He has told us which mechanisms will not work and which mechanism is ideal. We greatly appreciate his correspondence. General wiki edit of information associated with mechanisms
25th September: All mechanisms updated and corrected. All information is also updated. Edited the Wiki.
26th September: Edited the wiki
27th September: Edited the wiki
    Dr. Badge
14th August: Worked on the second Genomic extraction, prepared the samples for the gel, worked out how to adapt the tips to allow for pressure to be applied.
23rd August: Suggested experiment to run and see what caused the failed growth experiment. Created two new plates of the 01#502 for definite fresh single colonies.
24th August: Vacuum dried the precipitated DNA ready for the slow gel.
30th August: Produced some dNTP's. Made the master mix for the PCR. Programmed the PCR block.
31st August: Cut the DNA out of the PCR gel. Looked at the 01#502 plates for signs of new growth.
4th September: Discussed options for engineering a BioBrick. Set up PCR.
10th September: Checked the primers from Friday.
12th September: Tested the gel extraction kit using a 1kb DNA ladder.
18th September: Sequenced the samples produced.
25th September: Checked all the teams work on the wiki, making sure everything is ready to be published.

Life is like a box of chocolates. A cheap, thoughtless, perfunctory gift that nobody ever asks for. Unreturnable because all you get back is another box of chocolates. So you're stuck with this undefinable whipped mint crap that you mindlessly wolf down when there's nothing else left to eat. Sure, once in a while there's a peanut butter cup or an English toffee. But they're gone too fast and the taste is... fleeting. So, you end up with nothing but broken bits filled with hardened jelly and teeth-shattering nuts. And if you're desperate enough to eat those, all you got left is an empty box filled with useless brown paper wrappers. (The Cigarette Smoking Man)

We would like to start by saying that many people helped throughout this project, many of whom are not mentioned in the Wiki (but we had to at the end of the day for political reasons). Any attempt of acknowledging them (them=other team members) falls short of reality...
It is impossible to express the amount of gratitute that really all the people that were involved in the realization of the project deserve. Your counsel, moral support, financing, help in many different ways were fundamental for the realization of the project... Eternal thanks.

Introduction of our OUC-iGEM Lab
Our OUC-iGEM Lab is attached to the Experimental Teaching Center of Marine Life Sciences, Ocean University of China. Our lab was established by Association of Science and Technology (OAST) in September, 2011. Our center has long endeavored to do researches in Marine Microbial Ecology, Marine Aquaculture Diseases, Marine Beneficial Microorganism, and eta. The main purpose of this lab is to support iGEM experiment. Considering that synthetic biology is a new branch of biology, our lab is directly managed by the iGEM members. The experimental apparatus gathers from many other labs of our center. Now our lab is trying to become an ""Open platform"" for every student who want and enable to do independently designed experiments. Our lab has now established a thorough  management system running by a 6 people committee.

Communication with Other Teams
It’s the second year for us to participate in iGEM, and we are lucky enough to have obtained much help from other teams. Especially, we communicate with the team of Peking University frequently. And we constructed good relationship with iGEM teams around the world through helping them in different ways. This year we started our modeling design without any experience from before. As for our noise analysis-model, ETH University helped us solve the fundamental problem of how to apply Gillespei Algorithm. And through communicating with Peking University, we have learned how to change whole biological reactions to elementary reactions and how to apply chemical mass action law.For 2012 world jamboree, Boston University buy the helium for us in advance to help our team show our project.
OUC-China iGEM Team belongs to Ocean University of China Association of Science and Technology (OAST). We did nearly half of the experiments in the lab of OAST. The experiments of GVP were totally done in it. Besides, most human practices were done with the help of other people in the Organization. We held Hands-on experience summer camp and 2th summer camp of life science and technology in favor of OAST this summer. Almost every iGEMers in ours team are OASTers. We love iGEM, and we love OAST.
Special Friends
Yang Liu : He is our advisor, he is our teacher, and what’s more, he is like our elder brother. One year before, we knew nothing about synthetic biology. He taught us a lot about experiments, managing lab and how to be a REAL scientist. With his help, we did most experiment of GVP and manage lab smoothly.
Wei Liu :She is our advisor and girlfriend of Yang Liu. Besides Yang Liu, she did much favor for us and helped Yang Liu to teach us Synthetic Biology. Because our team was divided into two groups and one group went to Qibebt, she helped us in qibebt about living, learning and experiment there.
Cooperator
We helped UBC to complete their survey about patent, and gave our own opinions in Nanjing university’s survey about part registry., then we forwarded the invitation for iGEM_TU_München’ survey. We also lent a hand to SUSTC Shenzhen-A and SUSTC Shenzhen-B as soon as they made contact with us. We are willing to help other teams and learn from others.
When Peking university took a visit of our school in August, they showed great interest in the gelase gene discovered by professor Shi Xiaochong, which they considered to be useful in their project. So we helped them acquire the strain and send it to Peking smoothly.

All experimental work was performed by team members except for the following:
The cscA gene was originally obtained by Chris French's lab from Escherichia coli O157:H7 strain Sakai
We were assisted in the cloning of cymA, napC and ccm as well as the transfer of the ccm part from pSB1C3 to pSC4K5 vector by our advisers (Dr. David Radford and Eugene Fletcher) and supervisor(Dr. Chris French)
Mutagenesis of the mtrA part (obtained by the team members) was performed by Dr. Chris French (using primers designed by the team members)
The Citrobacter freundii genomes were sequenced by Prof. Anil Wipat and Dr. Wendy Smith at Newcastle University. Genome sequencing was done by Dr. Smith while genome assembly was done by Prof. Anil Wipat together with two team members. Genome annotation was done automatically by RAST and data extraction from this annotation was done by the team.
We would like to thank all the people who guided us through this tough but rewarding summer:
Dr. Chris French for his support in every step, for teaching us that there are shortcuts in science, for all the work on getting the biobricks right and for so many other things!
Eugene Fletcher for all the help in the lab and for being our sequencing guru,
Dr. David Radford for showing us the lawful evil way of doing experiments!
Dr. Jane Calvert for being an amazing guide in the world of human practices, for being there for us every week, for the enthusiasm and for liking our (sometimes not so good) ideas,
Dr. Pablo Schyfter for teaching us that you should look at everything from all possible angles, for contradicting Jane and for teaching us to always ask 'Where is the Why?',
Dr. Louise Horsfall for her very inspiring views on the relationship between the public and science,
Dr. Claire Marris for giving us food for thought on regulations and legislation,
John Wilson-Kanamori and Donal Stewart for their help in trying to make some sense of our models,
Donal Stewart for the nice java tool that helped us visualise the model.
John Innes for his interesting views on life, the universe and everything and for the stimulating conversations,
Dr. Wendy Smith for showing us around the Centre for Bacterial Cell Biology and walking us through every step that leads from raw DNA to getting its genome sequence
Prof. Anil Wipat for showing us what to do with said sequence
Dr. Bruce Ward and Matthew Knighton for their help with the fuel cells and for lending us their lab equipment.
Dr. Chris Mowat for his help with haem staining protocol and general advice on work with S. oneidensis

Team Ivy Tech
.
We are undergraduate students in the Biotech and Nanotech at Ivy Tech Community College.  We have had the invaluable experience of working as undergrads on real world problems in a lab setting that many in our positions don’t get.  We value the guidance and instruction given by Professor Twaddle and the experience gained by completing our first genetic engineering competition.

Credits.
Team IvyTech-South Bend would sincerely like to thank both the Gronigen and Edinburh teams for submitting sequences for the E. coli arsenic sensitive promoters and the gene sequence for the arsenic represser.  Our project and subsequent constructions was made feasible by their BBa_K190015 and BBa_J33201 parts.  We would like to also thank the Endy lab for the construction of the mRFP1 promoter testing vector BBa-J61002 which was instrumental in revealing the effect of the ArsR repressor on the threshold of pArs.  All of the technical achievements claimed by the team was the result of contributions of each team member, often working in parallel to construct or test parts.  Particular credit goes to the senior members of the team: Irene Fahrberger and her huge supply of competent cells and unquenchable energy, and Andrea Hakaj, Chris Moseti, and Alice Do for establishing the initial direction of the project.  Floyd Dixon gets the credit for this wiki, as it is...  To Professor Twaddle, who provided the big picture constantly and was a never ending source of warnings about technical pitfalls and of course for his ""word smithing,"" we, the team have unending thanks.

A short video introducing our team, Shenzhen, a special consortium named after a city, and what is the co-cultured project in BGI College and how students united.
Graduate Education in BGI College
    BGI College is an educational institution founded by BGI Research Institute. Its graduate division, BGI Education Center of CAS, is co-founded by Chinese Academy Of Sciences in 2012, and authorized to grant master's and doctoral degrees. In Sep. 2012, about 80 students have started their study and research in BGI College.
BGI College has also initialed several joint education programs with leading research universities around the world, including:
 - the University of Copenhagen,
 - Aarhus University,
 - the University of Hong Kong and
 - the Chinese University of Hong Kong.
    One of our team members, Ms. Qiong WU, is just from the BGI-CUHK joint program and pursuing her master degree on Genomics and Bioinformatics.
Innovation Classes on Genomics
    BGI College is not admitting undergraduate students itself, but students from nine universities in China have the opportunity to join us, to take courses and participate in research programs on genomics related fields. This co-culturing project is called Innovation Classes on Genomics, initialed by BGI College.
    With mature curriculum design and credit exchange plan, students can choose to finish their schoolwork in BGI College, from the 2nd or 3rd year in regular college course. Most team members of Shenzhen 2012 are from seven schools in this co-culturing program.
Qinsi Liang is a graduate in biotechnology at NEAU. He is interested in Artificial Life and believes it will solve many problems including shortage of energy and food. And anti-aging is another field he interested, since age-related diseases are human's unavoidable nightmare for everybody. He also likes table tennis, Starcraft, chess, hiking, programming, gardening and swimming in free time.

Co-instructors
    Both instructors of Team:Shenzhen, have also been acting as instructors or advisors of the two team from SUSTC. As both teams from SUSTC are software teams, wet-lab experiences can be shared by Team:Shenzhen.
    In the Biosearch project, K2 has given some suggestions on search engine and data structure, and also shows great enthusiasm in program testing and spreading.
    In the TTEC project, Yu helped in designing the expression vector and wet-lab works. With some course work, Yu and K2 have shown them the great significance in engineering terminators with different efficiency in prokaryotes.
Laboratory Sharing
As SUSTC is a very young university in Shenzhen, they have not built their own biology laboratory. As BGI Research Institute has also some terminator related projects, Team:Shenzhen has been sharing our laboratory with SUSTC-B, for the wet-lab part in the TEC project.
Workshops
Two teams of SUSTC have visited BGI in July and held a workshop among the tree teams. We also afterwards moved on to HKUST and had a four-team workshop there. As the three teams in Shenzhen are all of their first time in iGEM, helpful information and suggestions have been exchanged face to face.
Lectures to High Schools
As an introduction to synthetic biology, lecture named ""Technologies on Programming Life"" was given to SUSTC & BGI iGEMers by K2. SUSTC & BGI iGEMers developed this lecture and shared it with students from four high school students, from June to September, promoting synthetic biology and iGEM to high schools students in Shenzhen.

Our Team
2012 SJTU-BioX-Shanghai is composed of eleven students and three instructors from SJTU and this is the fourth time for our school to participate in iGEM.
2012 SJTU Bio-X Shanghai iGEM Team logo
Our understanding to synthetic biology grows with every paper we read, every lecture we attend and every idea we proposed. Start with passion, we come together because of a common dream to design something cool, something brand-new and something that is applicable. We are also attracted to the broad and promising future of synthetic biology, hoping that this competition can be our debut in making contributions to human health, energy resources, research and any other field with synthetic biological methods.
There are innumerable brilliant ideas in the brain storming. There are fierce discussions in the lab meeting. There are obstacles in experiments. There are busy bodies working into midnight. We laugh, we enjoy. We argue, we improve. One thing that never changes is our trust to each other. We are teammates, we are friends, we are family.Another thing that will not change is our confidence in our project and our dream. That is what keeps us moving forward without fear.
Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU)
An imperial edict issued in 1896 by Emperor Guangxu, established Nanyang Public School in Shanghai. The normal school, school of foreign studies, middle school and a high school were established. Sheng Xuanhuai, the person responsible for proposing the idea to the emperor, became the first president and is regarded as the founder of the university.
Shanghai Jiao Tong University
Since the reform and opening up policy in China, SJTU has taken the lead in management reform of institutions for higher education, regaining its vigor and vitality with an unprecedented momentum of growth. SJTU includes five beautiful campuses, Xuhui, Minhang, Luwan Qibao, and Fahua, taking up an area of about 3,225,833 m2. A number of disciplines have been advancing towards the top echelon internationally, and a batch of burgeoning branches of learning have taken an important position domestically.
Today SJTU has 31 schools (departments), 63 undergraduate programs, 250 masters-degree programs, 203 Ph.D. programs, 28 post-doctorate programs, and 11 state key laboratories and national engineering research centers.
SJTU boasts a large number of famous scientists and professors, including 33 academics of the Academy of Sciences and Academy of Engineering, 92 accredited professors and chair professors of the ""Cheung Kong Scholars Program"" and more than 1,900 professors and associate professors.
After more than a century of operation, Jiao Tong University has inherited the old tradition of ""high starting points, solid foundation, strict requirements and extensive practice."" Students from SJTU have won top prizes in various competitions, including ACM International Collegiate Programming Contest, International Mathematical Contest in Modeling and Electronics Design Contests.  More than 200 of the academics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and Chinese Academy of Engineering are alumni of Jiao Tong University.

Bio-X Institutes
The Bio-X Institutes of Shanghai Jiao Tong University was formed in 2005 by merging the Neuropsychiatric and Human Genetics Group (NHGG), which was established in 1996, and the Bio-X Life Science Research Center, which was established in April 2000.
Bio-X Institutes
The founding of the Bio-X Institutes represents a landmark in interdisciplinary research among the life sciences. The mission of the Institutes is to provide not only an interdisciplinary institute, but also to serve as a forum for discussion among scientists and students from a variety of disciplines and fields.
The current director of the Institutes is Prof. Lin He, a fellow of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and the honorary director is Prof. Steve Zhu, physics Nobel Laureate. The Institutes consist of a number of ""core"" and ""satellite"" groups lead by dozens of distinguished scientists and specially appointed professors from China and abroad, as well as many highly-talented post-graduates and research fellows from various academic backgrounds all being supported by a team of administrative professionals and research technicians.
The research at the Bio-X Institutes focuses on interdisciplinary topics between nutrition, health& disease, development and reproduction, biosaftey and DNA computing. More in detail, we currently have research programs in genome mapping and cloning, functional genomics, pharmacogenomics, proteomics, psychiatric metabolism, DNA computing, bioinformatics and nation-wide protection of genetic resources.

The Dundee iGem team would like to extend our deepest thanks to each and every individual,                  company and sponsor who have helped us along our way. Without your kind assistance and support,                  our project would only have remained an idea.
Thanks to the Division of Molecular Microbiology in the College of Life Sciences, University of Dundee, for giving us laboratory and office space, and the use of equipment, to carry out this project. We gratefully acknowledge The Wellcome Trust Rotation Studentship Program at Dundee for providing key molecular biology equipment. We thank all our sponsors for the consumables and some other equipment used in this work (listed below). Student stipends over the summer were awarded by The Wellcome Trust (seven studentships). Travel funds were provided by the Scottish Universities Life Sciences Alliance (SULSA), the University of Dundee, the James Hutton Institute  and the Nine Trades of Dundee.  T-shirt design was the work of Frank Sargent.  Other individuals worthy of special mention are:
Dr James Cargill: For sharing his knowledge of Clostridium difficile.
Miss Katie Ravenscraig Morrison: Who created the graphic version of our team mascot.
Mr Jaeger Hamilton: For taking part in the video for our song.
Mr Andrew Herd: For helping with the design of the wiki.
Mrs Geraldine Sandilands: For keeping us right with all of the travel arrangements for Edinburgh, London and Amsterdam.
Dr Jackie Heilbronn: For general assistance with ordering and lab safety.
Dr Lisa Grayson: Who assisted us when answering the safety questions and helped us to formulate our risk assessments.
Dr Nicola Stanley-Wall: For advice, and for providing us with materials that we were able to use on our outreach day at The Shore.
Mr Nicholas Dawes: For advice and help with wiki, Matlab and Comsol.
Dr Sarah Coulthurst and her group: For advice and and discussions on bacterial Type VI Secretion Systems.
Professor Eric Cascades: For allowing us to reproduce his diagram of the Type VI Secretion System.
Professor Angus Lamond: For his artistic input.
Professor Neil Fairweather: For providing us with a synthetic gene for the phage endolysin.
Mr Ross Middlemiss: For setting up the iGEM recording suite and mastering our song.
None of the advisors or instructors are involved in C. difficile research nor study the Type VI Secretion Systems of Salmonella nor are experts in modelling bacterial population dynamics or gut bulk flow - the project areas were chosen entirely by the team. All cloning and sequencing was carried out by Rachael, Avril and Nicola. Western blotting and radiolabelling work was done by Kimberly. Tracy Palmer, Grant Buchanan, Frank Sargent and Ciaran Kelly were the supervisors of this part of the project. Website design was started by Chris and finished off by Avril and Andrew H. The Android apps, games and other software were written by Chris. Mathematical modelling was figured out by Johnny, Jill and Chris under the supervision of Dyce, Lionel and Andrew S. All juggling was performed by Avril and Duncan.

Personal statement
Reading is a wonderful journey of my life. It’s fantastic to experience different life in books. Another way to enrich my life is to travel. I feel good when I wander in different cities or even in the same city at different time. However, I’m not always a quiet girl. Sometimes I get crazy. For example, I get excited when Novak is playing a tennis game; I get moved when a beautiful story is going on; I get angry when somebody cheats me. All the emotions make me a real person.
Lab is a place of magic. In the lab, we exhibit the world of biology in various ways and then it becomes a 3D or even 4D picture. It never ends and it can be better. Biology changes me a lot. I really want to do something to know a little more about the world and improve the world. Life is tough now. It’s time to deal with cancer and diabetes. I will rise to the challenge.
I enjoy IGEM because we work as a team when it’s going on. We are never alone. We brainstorm. We argue. We fail. We insist. It’s never too late to have new ideas.
Come on, boys and girls. It’s our time now.

The whole project should be attributed to the undergraduate students of Fudan_D iGEM team.
Chao Zhang, the great team leader of Fudan_D iGEM team, took a lot of effort in the team organization and human arrangement.He participated in both the design and the experiment of the project.
Xiang Zhao and Xiaoting Zhu focus on checking the reporter genes. They constructed the functional truncation fragment and tried to find the best reporter through experiment
Taijie Jin and Hankun Li took efforts in getting the overly length telomere sequences, which is the spirit of our project.
Yancheng Zhao, Jie Cao and Yu Ye talked about the potential usage of the nuclease as a molecular switch in the “artificial telomere system”, with the experimental help of Yilai Li and Yichang Liu on the construction of the nuclease.
Jie Cao was also in charge in the human practice of the team, together with Yu Li, Zhihao Guo, Wentao Chen and Zengmin Li, designed the “iGEM ABC” dictionary.
Wei Ning designed the fantastic wiki page and keep updating. He took charge in making the poster, logo and PPT. He also took pictures of team members and experiment.
Duo Xu takes charge in the social website like twitter and facebook of our team. She did good job in the communication with other iGEM teams.
Kangyun Dong and Zhongcheng Wang took part in the brainstorming and discussion of the project. They were responsible for the financial affairs and the travel arrangement.
Haotian Guo and Chen Dan participated in the brainstorming and discussion of the project, taking up good suggestion. They made effort in constructing the luminarycyanobacteria , which is a backup project for Fudan_D and the future iGEM team. DAN Chen also explored the possibility in inducing the Cre-LoxP system into the telomere for biosafety.
Wei Wei is in charge of the “IGEM Association”, an interesting club about synthetic biology, cooperating with Fudan_D team in Human Practice program.

Personal statement
The first time I saw different imaginative programs brought by different schools from all over the world in the IGEM competition , I was completely astonished by the simple but elegant modules and designs of synthetic biology. So it was a great honor for to be a member of Fudan IGEM team fighting all this brutal summer with other brilliant teammates together. I appreciated the logic and seriousness of our main project , and it was also full of wild imagination to introduce telomere into synthetic biology. Just can not wait to share this cool design with your guys in Hongkong.

iGEM: I Gotta Enjoy, Man!
Now working in a bioinformatics lab, I am delight to see the data coming into reality. But I must admit to actually bring something into reality is hundreds of times harder than let it stay in our imagination. Though it costed me hundreds of hours reading paper, thinking and working, it has been my greatest pleasure for the recent half year constructing the whole idea, developing every possibilities, solving all the problems, cultivating my hope and seeing the project grow.  This is the first time I particpate in this game, and I believe it won't be my last contact with synthetic biology. There is nothing to lose, we are the pioneer !
I enjoy reading, skiing, dancing, swimming, programming, all kinds of ball games, not a typical Bio-guy, I hope to see you guys in USA soon!   handongma.work@gmail.com

Survival of the fittest !
Personal statement
I am interested in many things such as ball games, travelling, but excluding talking and performing which indeed I am not good at, and great zest in science, especially biochemistry and computational biology. As a science student, I revere the nature but also want to make use of it, especially the living creatures, which I think is just a complex organic matter but highly ordering and possessing the soul, therefore, can be divided into parts and be designed and synthesized as we want. Thus I join in the Fudan_D team and participate in the iGEM in order to enjoy the delight of designing and controlling, which at last been turned out to be a tough work! Though difficult to get it, joy is always there when we tried to.

Personal statement
I always believe that only if we get to understand the rules of nature, will we know how to deal with ourselves. And this craving impels me to choose biology as my major.When i encountered with iGEM, i find it a world full of marvel. From the beginning, indeed, you will never know what you will create in the end, and that's the most attractive part in iGEM.

To enjoy life science means to enjoy life and enjoy science.
Interests
For music style, my favourite is the folk rock, but I also love choral music and pop. Yoga has been my favourite sport for a very long time, beating Ping-Pong, badminton and swimming, but recently it shows a tendency to be replaced by golf. And I'm also a great food and travel buff, a big manga and fiction fan, and of course, a person enthusiastic in cell biology !
Personal statement
Well, like almost all the stories begin with ""Long long ago"", my story begins with my dream to become a story teller since long long ago. And I think I've already on my way to it, just a little different with those story tellers in common sense: I'm a story teller in a white gown! And my works are not done on paper or in WORD document, but inside the cells. I have genes as my leading characters, whose relationship with each other make the plot. I have enzymes as the supporting roles to complete the story. And I write my sentences in my experiments. There're love stories, epics, comedies and tragedies happening inside the cells everyday. And this time, with our Fudan-D team workers, I feel so excited to participate in completing this story and can't wait to see the gorgeous ending !
At last, just as my rabbit says, IGEM means ""I'm Gonna Enjoy Myself"" to me! Hope all you guys in IGEM enjoy yourselves too !

No practice, no gain in one's wit.
Interests
Except the biology,most of my favotite things are about Japan.just like comic,anime and animation from Japan.Oh,I'm a EVA fan.And I like badminton and music.
Research interest
Cell biology,Development Biology,Neurobiology and Synthetic Biology
Personal statement
You can know from my intersts that I have the ""potential"" to become a otaku.But become of the lab,I change it.The regular life make me feel fresh.
The reason why I join the iGEM is that I appreciate the the spirit of exploration and marvel at the natural world's regularity but also diversity.During the experiments,the most impressive to me is that there is a  crack between the theoretical knowledge and the real practice.I believe ""No practice, no gain in one's wit.""

In doing we learn.
Some of my friends think that I'm a dreamy girl who wants to learn something of everything and everything of something. Luckly，biology easily allows me to get lost in the haze. I also have a vibrant personality and love to communicate and cooperate with other people. When I first knew iGEM，I thought it is high time for me to try something fun. But the deeper I immerse myself in，the firmmer I regard iGEM is an unshakeable goal to pursuit.

There are no secrets to success. It is the result of spending every minute wisely when waiting for PCR !
Self-introduction:
I am a senior student ready to spend my last year in Fudan University. Well…if I were asked what is most attractive for me to join the iGEM team, I will say making “machine” sounds cooooool when I first heard the name of this competition (jk~). As a member of “paper group”, a few other people and I were devoted to search for useful information from a great amount of articles, kinda nice job for an introverted guy like me.
Besides iGEM, I am working in another lab focusing on the genetic diseases, and from there I gained a lot of passion leading me to explore more thoroughly into the world of genes.
I like synthetic biology. It is exciting to brainstorm with friends about the new ideas or to think independently about a new model. Thanks to all the teammates and I love u all !

Haotian Guo
Sophomore
Dream a little dream, and make the dream come true in this Lab.
Interests
Some people in the lab think my favorite thing is reading papers…. Well, at least, I don’t buy it. I am not only a bookworm but also an enthusiast of classic music, musical, tennis as well as ping-pang, bridge, drawing and Latin Dance.
Research interest
Cell Biology, Theoretical Biology, System and Synthetic Biology
Personal statement
“Hello World!” This is the first time I participate in the iGEM, albeit I have known it from my friend (who took part in iGEM twice) when I was young…..uh, I mean, younger (though at that time I was still always thought to be a married man), and have started to acquire stuffs from the works of other teams before I came to this college.
I Have a Dream. Because of the interest in those works which demonstrate the fundamental rules of the natural world, I always want to do some research to show the basic principles of living things………………..Nevertheless, I join in the iGEM team just for fun, … at very beginning; indeed I started to understand how synthetic biology could help us to figure out those essential mechanism now, and that is why I gradually transform into an avid iGEM “sophomore” from a “freshman” in this summer.
I Love the Environment in the Lab, although without antibiotic resistance it is a little hard to survive – so thank god we are not bugs. I also like to do some theoretical works like modeling……Consequently, it seems that the best job for me is doing “dry” works in a “wet” lab; unfortunately, I doubt whether such career exist.

Smile to the life.
Self-introduction:
Enjoy the time fighting for a goal.
Enjoy the time contemplating to overcome the difficulties.
Enjoy the time doing experiments day and night.
Enjoy the whole time with my teammates.
I’m Chan Zhang from Fudan_D, Shanghai, China. This is my second time taking part in the iGEM. Although both the project and the teammates have changed, I believe something remains constant. That’s our passion for synthetic biology. Thus, look forward to meeting with all of you guys in the Jamboree.

（Write a motto here)
What do I get from IGEM ?
It's never easy to start the journey of iGEM. The first time we joined this competition last year, we almost learnt from the very beginning and almost set up the lab from nothing. It is a hard but wonderful experience. What we get from iGEM is not only knowledge of synthetic biology, but also the way to solve problems, the sparks of inspiration, and friends. We quarreled for different thoughts and ideas and really felt happy when we got a little progress. This year, with the theoretical preparation and practical experience, we are sure to go much further. Enjoy it guys !

You become limited if you set limitations for yourself.
I feel free here because it is said to be a 'free-style' introduction. I majored in biology and my favourite is biochemistry and biophysics and blablablabla...I like reading papers and staying in the lab and I am a good student and a geek...well do you really believe it? You shouldn't !
In fact I am not a model student at all, at least and not that boring. I love drawing, soccer (maybe other kinds of sports too), and metal music. My favourite genre is black metal, especially depressive black metal. I know not so many people have actually ever heard of it, so if you are black metal fan and also an iGEMer feel free to contact me !
A number of iGEMers had some research experience even before the competition no matter where you are from, but iGEM is different in a way that it is a project dominated by ourselves and also needs great cooperation. Science is fun, and it becomes more intriguing when we found that the driving force of the project is our own motivation. One might find it dull to be in the lab and do the same kind of work again and again, but the exciting part is to see the expected and sometimes unexpected results. Also, I feel lucky to be in a group with so many GREAT people ! Good luck !

Do what you want, if you have a dream for BETTER.
Interests
I am a outgoing and worm-hearted person who enjoy his life. As a result, I've got a wide range of hobbies. Besides reading various books, especially science fictions and detetive stories, I also love outdoor activities, such as soccer, tennis and cycling.
Research Interest
Ecology, Environmental Biology and Biosafety
Personal statement
As a senior undergraduate student, I'm still a freshman of iGEM programme. I got awareness of the programme from some of my friends, who have participated in the last iGEM competition. Now we become teammates, who all enjoy working together and solving problems.
I join in the team in order to learn something beyond my previous concerns. Which, I believe, is very essential for a 'recruit' in science researches just like me. I hope I can enjoy the process.

The tragedy of life is not so much what man suffer, but what they miss.
Personal statement
Shortly after I was accepted into the Fudan iGem team Ders, I realized synthetic biology was a changeful world and which was worth to explore more deeply. In my eyes, the theory and application tend to stimulate each other no matter which direction one takes. Working on actual problems can help to reinforce the grasp of cell biology or synthetic biology theory and methods, and it will provide motivation for developing innovative and useful experiences from the experiments on some pre-engineered system.
From this competition, or in an other word, from this game, I gained a lot about knowledge, teamwork, sharing happiness, and keeping a curious heart in bioresearch.

Tout est bien qui finit bien.
Interests
I am mad about musicals especially those writen by Sir Andrew Lloyd Webber and have a habit of collecting items related to the Phantom of the Opera and Les Miserables. Besides, in order to understand French musicals I learned a little French. Gradually, I am fascinated by this language.
RESEARCH INTEREST
Biochemistry and Synthetic Biology
Personal Statement
This is my first time to paticipate in iGEM. Thanks to Prof. Ding and everyone else in the team, I learned a lot of things that cannot be learned in class.
Look, listen and learn. That is what I did most in the past year.

Every little helps a mickle.
What’s my job in the team?
The main job of mine in the team is to read papers! Though it seems rather ‘boring’ thing, diversities of papers really help us to construct a fairly full framework, which gives innovative ideas and strong supports to the project. Also, I am ready to do some simple experiments when necessary.
About my lab experience
I am now working in a molecular biology lab, doing research in the cell division. Always willing to learn from my experienced mentors, I really love the rigorous environment in the lab. As the saying goes, ‘In doing we learn’, there comes a lot of knowledge and benefits through failure. Yeah, that’s true, ‘lifeless, faultless’. It is the same to our iGEM team. Nevertheless, to cooperate with those iGEM fellows has another kind of experience, full of passion and fun.
Know more about my interests
Though as a student of science, I am not a dull girl, for I often play crazily with friends! Volleyball and badminton are my favourite sports! Also, immersed in classical music, I play violin in my leisure time.

Since in choice of the distance,I simply travel in wind and rain.
Research interest
Plant Molecular Genetics
Personal statement
You must be curious about my name. Yes, please believe your eyes, my name is Xu Duo indeed, and it is the exact word “many” in Chinese. You can simply call me Erica to avoid a long and tedious explain. Although I’m not focus my research interest in synthetic biology, all the skills I have learnt in my research can be applied in this competition, we have to admit that genetic engineering made it possible for us to try to explain enigmas in almost every field of biology. And after knowing more about the synthetic biology, it turns out to be a very attracting field.
Also I’m excited about going to Hong Kong for the competition, since people always use “dynamic” to describe Hong Kong, this time I can have the chance to experience the “dynamic” in academic field myself. I’m honest, friendly and patient, so I am willing to make friends with you. Let’s make this contest a wonderful memory together.

We have joy, we have fun, we are WHU-iGEMers in the sun!
Welcome to visit the wiki of WHU-2012!
Our project, E. coslim, is aimed at groping an effective way for people to enjoy wolfing delicacies while not worry about gaining weight.
Working day and night, we finally submited 66 biobricks. As the saying goes, Rome was no built in one day. Every step to the MIT and every biobrick used to construct E. coslim are soaked with inspiration and perspiration of every teammate. While several weeks of sleepless night exhausted our body, our spirit sparkled with each other.
Do you want to be keep slim figure while enjoying your gluttonous feast? Are you dreaming of enjoying food without worrying about overweight? Now we WHU iGEMers sincerely invite you to come with us to explore the magic of E. coslim.
Jiawei Huang
I succeeded Xuepeng Huang as the team leader of WHU-iGEM in March 2012, when the whole team fell into chaos and confusion.
With the help of some active members, I managed to coordinate the team and keep all things in order. I want to give thanks to all my teammates for their remarkable devotion and the great assistance they had given me.
Now I am taking efforts every moment and hoping for a good result, I really enjoy the great happiness of thinking, working and teamwork in iGEM.
IGEM, hooray!
Kuanwei Sheng
Designer of the project, senior student in College of Life Sciences of WHU.
He always wears a smiling face. He loves to tell all kinds of jokes though others seldom laugh. All the team members think he is kind of Sheldon except himself. Bazinga!!! He is actually a man of principle, passion and dedication. As the major designer of this year’s project, he really appreciate iGEM for providing him the chance of freely brainstorming and designing a project without any restriction. Also, he thinks he is extremely fortunate to have a bunch of wonderful and versatile teammates with whom he can strive, share his dreams and ideas. He is truly proud of becoming a member in WHU-iGEM team.
GUYS, I LOVE YOU ALL!!
Xian Xia
Xian Xia is a senior student of College of Life Science ,Wuhan University.
In our project, Xian Xia not only made great contributions to team construction, but also played an important role in conducting the whole cellulose system. As one of the most respected team leaders, he lived up to the expectations of his teammates as well as the responsibilities of his own. Xia’s interests about biology include expression and purification of membrane proteins and the mechanisms of processes that cytoskeletal proteins participate in.
Apart from biology, Xia enjoys reading and ping-pong.
Long Mei
Long Mei, a senior student from College of Life sciences, Wuhan University.
Mei is determined to be a top scientist and do some research to benefit human health.
In iGEM, under Mei’s leadership, his group members have made extraodinary efforts and successfully completed their task of biobricks construction. This sunny and smart boy seems to have nothing to worry about at this time, except for one thing--his body weight. He really wants to put on some weight. Now, maybe he is savoring snacks somewhere, who knows?
Fan Cheng
Fan Cheng, a year 4 student majoring in biology, just like an undifferentiated stem cell, now hesitates about which direction to differentiate to satisfy her inner interest. However, one thing that she is 100 percent sure is that being both a good scholar and a good educator is her permanent goal. Because in eyes of her, those two are true romantic careers considering the current society which worships wealth and fame.
First drawn to iGEM by the dream of a respected graduate, and the wish to help one determined classmate to make his idea come true, now she found that the best part of the whole thing turns out to be the sense of the identity in the process. In this project , Fan Cheng is responsible for the construction of the system of the designed probiotic bacteria which can metabolite the fatty acids much faster and related methodological work about detecting fatty acids. Beyond biology, Cheng loves literature, especially those classical Chinese poems. If not being a biologist, she thinks that being a writer for example, a column writer to make science more accessible to the public, is a good option.
Wenxiong Zhou
Wenxiong Zhou is a reliable man who has a wide interest from cell biology, differential equations, computer programming to classical music and drama. In a free sunny afternoon he is sometimes in a daze and wonder how to find the mathematical laws in harmonics and apply it to the modeling of cell signal transduction. Though reliable, talented and handsome, he is still in single.
Boxiang Wang
The art director of WHU-CHINA team, Core experimenter of the cellulose synthesis group.
Born in March 12, Boxiang Wang is a typical Pisces boy. He is not only the master of painting and acting but also a genius in writing stories. He always wears a smile on his face and shows a great sense of humor. In iGEM, Wang is a fast learner as well as a good technician. Sometimes he may be exhausted and fell in the dead end of some philosophical questions. But when Wang got high spirits, he can be extraordinary creative and undefeated. He regards these people working in the team as the treasure in his life.
Tong Wang
I’m Tina, a senior student from College of Life Science, Wuhan University.
I come from Qianjiang, a beautiful and affluent town in Hubei province,which is famous for lobster, especially the cuisine of braised prawns. By the time you come to QianJiang,I’ll treat you with braised prawns. Since I’m a slightly fat girl, I really hope that our project will finally succeed and be put into practice.
Jiani Hu
Hello, world! I’m Jiani Hu, a sophomore student of College of Life Sciences, Wuhan University.
I love nature and animals. Last year, a friend gave a Golden Retriever to me. I have a lot of sweet memory with him and regard him as one of my family members. In my leisure time, I will draw some traditional Chinese paintings and play wei chi with my father. iGEM widened my horizon and l cherished our precious friendship during this year. In our project, I try my best to finish the experiment and share our ideas with those who know little about synthetic biology. I do have fun in this Working Experience!
Shiwei Gao
Hi, I'm Shiwei Gao, a senior student of College of Life Sciences, Wuhan University. My field of study is in bacterial etiology.  I think that the idea collection and human practice are two  wonderful parts in our project. As for myself ,I enjoy playing tennis, making western dishes, travelling etc. Brownie, hotdog in Costco, and Beijing Luzhuhuoshao are all my favorites . Wish I can learn  fencing some day！
Jing Zhang
Hello! I'm an energetic girl who loves biological science, loves computers and loves all the interesting things full of mysteries and innovations. Though there are setbacks and adversity on my way, I still believe sunshine will disperse all the frog and gloom as long as I hold to my dream and never give up.
PengchengZhou
Pengcheng Zhou is a critical thinker in our team. Besides his sunny smile, he always thinks further and deeper than others, giving impressive ideas and advices. He played one of the central roles at the beginning of our project, who firstly raised the idea of weight-losing. When we were hovering in chaos in this March, his determination and decisions make us proceed. For individual reasons, he did not continue being the hero in following episodes. For now, he has left us to Australia, starting his life as an exchange student. We cherish the memory of the days we attempting together with him, and thank his contribution to WHU-China.
Yuan Feng
Brian Feng is from School of Mathematics and Statistics.
He is interested in finding the 'subtle accuracy' in qualitative questions, which is always a headache for biology student. For him, the iGEM 2012 is a best opportunity to practice his words. By taking a careful look at WHU-China 2012's program, Brian and his group members suggest to build a competition model concerning various resources and predators. At the moment, they are working really hard trying to answer the question whether it is possible to create our ideal E.coli.
Chang Liu
Hi! This is Chang Liu, Shelly, a Year 3 undergraduate student at WHU majoring in Biology.  My research is mainly about obesity and diabetes.
It is written that you reap what you sow, then I must have got a bumper harvest in iGEM.
Bringing me into synthetic biology and handing me the key to creative thinking ,iGEM really benefits me a lot . More importantly,this competition brought me a lot of good friends. Best wishes to all my dear teammates, to those who worked days and nights ,to those who stayed up late and got up early .Thank you all for the scientific spirits you guys have cultured in me, thank you for the laughter and tears we once shared. Let’s pull together and fight till the end!
Min Ye
Min Ye is a junior student of College of Life Science, Wuhan University. He is a good problem solver, having participated in several connections of genes. As a competent team player, his sense of humor often makes others laugh aloud. What’s more, his sense of responsibility helps us to finish the project rapidly and precisely.
Xuepeng Huang
Hello, everyone! My name is Xuepeng Huang, or you can call me Xuepeng or pengpeng. I’m happy to join the team, the iGEM team of Wuhan University of China. Taking part in discussion and experimenting, we can make friends and promote ourselves. In the spare time, I prefer to listening music, get together with friends, walk in the beautiful campus , reading history books and something else. Hope to make friends with you and wish the world would be better and better in our efforts.
Yancheng Liu
Hello! I’m Yancheng Liu, a student in Wuhan University. I am interested in programming and using them to solve problems in life science. I can also make three-dimensional animations using 3ds Max or Maya. I joined iGEM team by chance and I learned a lot during these days. My work is realizing visualization of our project’s biological process and making post-processing of the movies. And I made many friends in our team. I like it!
Cheng Zhao
Who is the man? Cheng Zhao or, also called Gent.
I joined in our team because the elites of our college get together here. Fighting all the night, lively discussions and brain storms are at anytime and anyplace. This is where creativity births.
My job mainly focuses on protein expression, improving protein identity system and checking the efficiency of other people’s work. Full of curiosity in my brain, I may keep on asking question until other teammates become crazy. As member of this great team, a belief rooted in my heart is that constructive suggestions are never too many to be needed in a team. I always emphasize observation, skepticism and results analysis to avoid our team deviated from its route.
GOD BLESS WHU, GOD BLESS OUR TEAM!!
Chao Huang
I’m the only one here from school of Public Health.
My favourite two hobbies are eating and doing experiments on organisms.Like others,it’s really confused for me how to keep in shape while don’t have to neglect whatever delicious.The project attracted me the moment I knew it, for its aim to free the worries of gluttons and involvement of many bacterial experiments as well.That was primarily why I joined the team.I have been looking forward to be the first one to take the engineering bacteria we synthesized.
Yutian Zhang
Hello, I’m Yutian Zhang, a junior student of College of Life Science, Wuhan University. I fell in love with biology When I was a high school student. I was ravished by the mystic reactions in human body. I almost like playing all sorts of ball games that I could contact, such as basketball, tennis , table tennis, football and so on. IGEM gave a precious opportunity to get on with a lot of outstanding schoolmates and get closed contact with the advancing synthetic biology. For my personal reason, I didn’t finish my job as expected. But I really enjoyed the experiences when we discussed and conducted the experiments.
Wei Hong
As far as I see, Science is the only thing that rules the world. Since my 5-year-old birthday, I have kept trying my best to learn science ,and that becomes one of the reasons why I chose to be a scientist.
To be a scientist! That is my dream and I have been working hard on it for almost 20 years.
That’s me! Wei Hong ,a person who is keen on science .I joined this team to get myself an opportunity to do my own design and turn it into reality.
There’s an old saying in China, A true warrior would never be afraid and he will overcome every obstacle on his way to victory. I believed in this and I know, practice makes perfect. And my dream will come true!
Liuyi Hu
Liuyi Hu is a senior student studying Statistics in Wuhan University.
She participated in iGEM not only because she is excited about the amazing biomedical applications of synthetic biology but also wants to evaluate synthetic biology against her own mathematical and statistical interests and abilities. She wants to see more ways for the two fields to reinforce each other. Previously she took part in the Mathematical Modeling Contest and has already gained a lot of experiences in the application of the mathematical methods. Now she is studying more advanced statistical software as an exchange student in Utrecht University.
Jin Liu
I am Jin Liu, a senior student from School of Mathematics and Statistics of Wuhan University. I like reading, listening to music and travelling. I am in charge of the mathematical modeling in our iGEM team. I didn't know much about biology before , but now I find a lot of beauty in biology and biostatistics.
Jianbo Wang
Professor Wang, our instructor, seems far from being amicable on first impression. He is a tall, thin man with glasses, showing extraordinary seriousness and rigidity in his eyes. For all this and the fact that he is the dean, there seems to be a great distance between him and the fellow students. After just a few conversations with him, however, we soon found out that, though strict as he is with our team, he shows great geniality and resourcefulness when communicating with us, and often provides us with all sorts of information that we need. It’s him who helped us prepare for our thesis defense, in which we won many professors’ approval. It’s him who offered to fund us with this project, so that we can do it without being hamstrung by financial problems. It’s still him who encourages us, offers valuable advices and his own experience, and acknowledges the progresses we have got. We want to thank him here for all the support he gives to us. Without him, we can’t be going this far.
Zhixiong Xie
Our instructor, Dr. Xie, is remembered by us for his symbolic smile on his face with a little baby fat. One can easily judge from his photo that he is that kind of nice teacher who keeps a close relationship with his students. He did indeed. During this graduation season, we were surprised to find that he joyfully companied his two phD students taking photos around the campus, even more excited than his students, as if the one who just got the phD degree was him. And he regards us just as the students in his lab. He never tries to hide his proud of us. When he leaded the freshmen to do the wild field training in the summer, he cannot help but talking about our creative work with them. The enthusiastic praise even makes us a little bit embarrassed. However, cautious and cool-minded as his major microbiology required, he is quite critical about our idea. While we were fascinated by our plan that our new probiotic can help us reducing weight by magnificently increasing the metabolic rate of the fatty acids, he pointed that we were over optimistic before we have collected complete data, for example, the percentage of the lipid in every day diet and the estimated maximum metabolic rate after overexpression of related genes. It proved later that these calculations were vital in the plausibility of the project and the successive experimental design. As the instructor responding for the project running, he guarantees every freedom for us to think and to realize our design, whereas he is always ready to hear our goals, progresses, questions, difficulties, and then gives his ingenious suggestions. In a word, those who need help will always get help from Dr. Xie, both on academic and in personal life.
Yu Chen
Yu Chen, associate professor of virology at Wuhan University. Doctor Chen’s research interests extends from SARS Coronavirus Nonstructural Protein nsp16 ,si RNA to the mechanism of RNA virus replication and transcription .Doctor Chen is a responsible and approachable teacher and he offered us a lot of constructive suggestions based on his rich experience in molecule cloning.
Well, it’s time for the start of a new journey of a new IGEM team. IGEM seemed to have magic power to attract a number of students to participate in it. At the beginning of November, 2011, with the guidance of some members from the precedent team, 18 juniors stood out of 80 applicants to become the vanguard of the new team. Also at the same time, the new journey started.
During the November, 2011, members of the team were divided into three groups each of which is guided by one group leader, respectively. And every week each group was expected to meet 2-3 times to view and discuss the outstanding works of previous IGEM competitions. And at the end of week, a feast full of innovative ideas and interesting opinions brought by each group to all the team members. Delving into various excellent ideas and works from other universities and colleges, we began to have a more intensive understanding of IGEM and embarked on our own project.
At the beginning of December, 2011, all of three groups had their origin but undeveloped ideas and introduced their ideas to all the members at the team meeting. Of course, we never stopped there despite of the coming of the final examinations of the semester. At the end of the semester, January, each group determined their project and started to collect information and consult relevant documents to device their ways to achieve their targets during winter vacation.
Although during winter vacation, members of the team got separate and celebrated festivals with their family at their homes, they still tried to communicate with each other online. Everyday, new information are provided and new progress is made. And thanks to this long vacation, members do not only have a good rest but also develop their ideas.
After vacation came a new academic semester and also a new beginning. Each group came up with their well-established ideas and details of their plans and presented them to each other. Decision was made by all of the members that which idea or project is the best one for the team. And “ E. colsim” captured everyone’s attention and won as the best idea. And so at the late February, the team determined their project and focused all their power and energy to work it out. In addition, to register the competition officially and at the same time acquire financial support from the department, the team had to prepare for the oral defence of the thesis in the department. To get support from the department, between late February and early March, everyday the team got together, discussed, enriched our plans and perfect our project. Fortunately, as an old Chinese phrase goes that KONG FU people live, the team successfully demonstrated their competency and received the financial support from the department.
After the oral defense, the team successfully registered competition and finally started the experiments and researches. Whether it’s day or night, whether it’s weekend or weekdays, there are members in the laboratory enjoying the happiness or overcoming the difficulties in the programs. Until now, six months has passed by, they still on their way to make their projects work well and still on their way to realize their dreams. Though there are tear and failures, setbacks and anxiety, the team still holds on. And on 3rd, October, 2012, the Asian qualifier, it’s time for the team to tell their ideas and dreams to the world.
Hello, iGEM!
Hello, Hong Kong!
Hello, MIT!
Hello, World!
Wuhan University is a prestigious university in China. It is a key university directly under the administration of the Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China. It is regarded as one of the best and most selective universities in China. Its history dates back to 1893, making it one of the oldest higher learning institutions in China. It became the first modern Chinese university in the early 1920s.
Seated at Wuchang luojia Hill,WHU is also famous for its beautiful natural scenery, hill and lake. The distinguishing early architecture of Wuhan University and the beautiful natural scenery match well. The early architecture of palatial style at Wuhan University, which mixes the eastern and the western architectural styles, is in exquisite layout.
1.The Library
The library is the highest building on Lion Hill. It’s the landmark and spiritual symbol of Wuhan University. The integrate appearance of the library is of traditional Chinese palatial architecture. It is designed by an American architect, Mr. F.H.Kales. What a surprise! On the top is erected seven-ring tripod, with heating chimney installed on the roof. The reinforced concrete framed structure and combined steel rack for the bearing was adopted in structural technology. On the ridge, ring corridor, and eaves are delicate ornaments of entwining dragons, cloudings, bucket arches, fairies and animals. It’s the knowledge treasury and academic status as well as a significant site for visitors.
2.Wuhan university administrative building
One of the distinctive characteristics of the buildings on Luojia campus is that they are built according to the topography of the hill and groping variation in order. There are more hills and less land on Luojia campus. Kales, architect and designer of the campus, solved the problem.
The sculpture is given to Wuhan University as a present by the 81st and 82nd students graduated from this university. Kunpeng is an animal in   Chinese fairly tale. In the North Sea, there’s a huge fish called “Kun”. As it swims, the water under its fin splashes 3,000 miles high. When it changes into a bird, it is called “Peng”, which can fly in the cloud of 90,000 miles high.
3.The Cherry Castle
In 1938, Wuhan was occupied by the Japanese invaders. Luojia Hill became the central headquarter and field hospital of Japanese army in Central China. It is not until eight years later that Anti-Japanese War ended in victory for us. The first cherry blossom was planted by the Japanese. However, as the florescence of cherry blossom is twenty to thirty years, the cherry blossoms now are absolutely not the original ones. A professor of Wuhan University has kept a record of the various data of cherry blossom for 60 years, which is even earlier than Japanese.
Are your used to a tidy and well-equipped laboratory? Are you often troubled by the lack of equipment and reagents? Yes we are. We do not even have an aspetic operating board functioning well. Sometimes we were scared by the loud voice emitted by the clapped-out centrifuge with broken lid. The fact that depressed us was that our PCR machine always went wrong. So to avoid being impeded by these problems, sometimes we had to ask for help from other laboratories.
Another difficulty depressed us was the terrible environment. The dustbins emitted a disgusting smell, hand washing basin was surrounded by a swarm of mosquitoes, laboratory tables were scratched out and rag and mop were also nauseating.
Fortunately, the terrible environment of the laboratory does not extinguish the passion of us. Everyday, team members came, did experiments and discussed their success or failures in experiments. On everyone’s face, there was big smile. Carefully and energetic, we progressively conduct our experiments and researches. And finally, our dream comes true.

We are an independent iGEM team. This means that we did not have a lab advisor and did everything by ourselves. Moreover, we had no host lab but worked in course labs of the Department of Biology and BIOSS , which were empty during the summer break.
In detail, we did all of the following tasks on our own -
We have:
- founded a registered society in order to be allowed to raise donations
- raised money
- purchased lab equipment/ consumables
- poured agar plates, mixed media, autoclaved pipet tips etc.
- found our project idea - the GATE assembly method is truly our own invention. No professor told us what project to choose, what methods to use etc.
- planned the lab work
- done the actual lab work - everything was done by team members of the 2012 iGEM Team - over this summer, we were the only ones to enter ""our"" lab. No professor, no advisor etc.
- organised public outreach events, write our philosophical essay.
- had contact with the media
- planned our trips to the jamborees (booked flights, busses, hostels etc.)
- worked on our wiki and project movie
We thank the following people/ institutions for their support:
- all the people working at BIOSS that helped us with our problems answered patiently our questions.
- especially we want to thank the BIOSS Toolbox staff for all their kind help and support
- the Lab of professor Weber for helping us with the SEAP essay, the EPO essay and the cell culture
- we thank Konrad Müller (Weber Lab) for the SEAP test vector (pKM001).
- we thank Dr. Mussolino and Professor Cathomen for their TALEN test plasmids and advice.
- the Media Center of Freiburg University for printing our poster and lending us a camera for the project movie
- the Pahl Lab for giving us advice on the Chip Assay
- Addgene for their superb sequence analyzing and illustration tool.
- all our sponsors, in particular BIOSS and the University Hospital Freiburg, for their generous financial support

Team
The FreiGEM 2012 Team
Our interdisciplinary team mainly consists of undergraduate students from every corner of the scientific landscape and beyond: Medicine, Biology, Molecular Medicine, Pharmaceutical Science and even Philosophy.
Our team leader Nicolas started the team in autumn 2011, when he first discussed participation in the competition with a small group of colleagues of his and some molecular medicine students, which were instantly enthusiastic about the prospect of taking part in a famous synthetic biology competition. The remaining team members joined in following up on announcements, through contact with former iGEM members or oral propaganda. The first meeting of our team was held in a Pub in Freiburg in November 2011 as an opportunity to get to know each other.  Since 2011, weekly iGEM meetings were set on to get things moving: finding a promising idea, investigating former projects and interesting methods, founding a non-profit association, scouting sponsoring options.  In spite of meeting every single week, it almost took us until April, that we finally pinned down an idea for our project: the development of a method to assemble a TAL protein with 14 DNA binding sites in one single reaction and the aim to use these proteins to direct effector enzymes to specific target sequences within the genome.  To realize our project, we were  able to go back to the unique knowledge of every single team member. Be it in research issues, financial questions or website-related problems, everyone in our team did his or her best to make the most out of the project.  During the period of lab work, we tried to spend at least some time together away from the lab to strengthen  team cohesion. We had a barbecue in Nico´s garden, bike tours around Freiburg and the obligatory late night search trip for food between gel extractions. Our work together was not only on a professional level but brought us together as friends and we surely will keep it that way beyond iGEM.
In the following, the freiGEM team members will introduce themselves:
Who we are
Student Leader
Nicolas Wyvekens
I´m a third-year medical student and the student group leader of our iGEM team. What I like most about iGEM is the opportunity to work on a project that we, as a team, have come up with and planned ourselves. As a medical student, I hadn’t received much training in molecular biology techniques, so it was very challenging for me to plan the project. Besides learning new lab skills, it was an important lesson to deal with frustration when days (and nights) of intense work turned up no positive results. In the end, it is even more rewarding to see that our idea actually works very well and that it attracts great interest from ’real’ scientists.
Master students
David Siegel
I'm 25 years old and studying biology in the 8th semster at the Albert-Ludwigs University Freiburg. Currently, I'm in the master programm and preparing to start my master thesis in the field of syntehtic biology and biotechnology.
The whole theory of synthetic biology, the idea of organising the seemingly chaotic structure of nature thrilled me since the first time I heard of it. When I got news of a new iGEM team I instantly took the chance and joined. Through the iGEM contest I was able to follow a project from the idea on a piece of paper, all the way to proof of concept experiments and final evaluation. I experienced the ups and downs of being in a team with people of so many disciplines and I got the chance to take part in every step that was necessary to make something happen.
Lisa Jerabek
I´m studying biology in the 8th semester and will start my Master´s thesis in the research area of synthetic biology in October.  By joining in on freiGEM2012 I accepted the challenge of planning and realizing a self-made project in my research area of interest. I considered my participation in the iGEM team as an opportunity to broaden my expertise in many respects. For me, a really important experience was to face the difficulties of lab work in a large team of members with profoundly varying skills and to learn how to cope with these discrepancies. My primary role in the team was the management of cell cultural issues, which is what made me the “cell culture lady” of the team.  I´m very grateful for the opportunity to learn new methods as well as to get to know new approaches to solving scientific problems and for such a great time with freiGEM2012.
Natalie Knoll
I'm studying biology in the 8th semester and starting to prepare for my master thesis. The iGEM 2012 contest was a great experience for me and im glad i took my last chance to join a iGEM team. It was a great time and i'm sure i will miss my team when the iGEM time ends. When im thinking about the countless hours we spend in the lap, all the days and at the end even the nights, i'm already sure i will miss this time and all the great people of my team.
Bachelor students
Lucas Schneider
During completion of my bachelor of science degree in molecular biology, I joined the IGEM Team of Freiburg.  My research interests are molecular biology, bioinformatics and plant biotechnology. My role in freiGEM 2012 was to instruct an interdisciplinary team of students in molecular cloning and experimental design. Finally, I am proud that we got the toolkit and the TAL-Vectors up and running.  It was a valuable experience working with such a team.
Lukas Boeckelmann
I am a student of Medicine in my fourth year and have always been fascinated by the opportunities that modern Molecular Biology has to offer. I have just started my MD thesis and many of the experiences I've already made with iGEM  help me greatly. I have benefited tremendously from the iGEM project: It has been very rewarding to research a topic in such depth, to discuss it with the wonderful and bright (and funny) people I have met in our team and to then develop methodical solutions that actually function well!  I am incredibly excited about the work we have done so far and about the work we will continue to do!
Franz Dressler
I´m a medical student in the 4th year and I joined iGEM due to the unlimited possibilities the project offers. It is a unique opportunity to explore a scientific question or to tackle an everyday biological problem - but the best thing about it: you are completely free to choose what field you want to engage in. From the medical point of view it is also intriguing to get more familiar with molecular methods. In all these regards my expectations have completely been fulfilled. We had an amazing time in the lab, but also exciting discussions and presentations, a vivid and enriching exchange of ideas and knowledge amongst the team members and thanks to the iGEM community.  My special contributions to our project were modeling as well as layout and design of our website and posters.
Kimon Runge
I´m studying medicine in the 4th year and I participate in iGEM because I want to get a better insight in the workings of a laboratory. And what better source of insight can you get than operating your own lab as a team?  Of course it’s much more than that and an experience I can recommend to anyone. My special mission is to plan the travels of the group.
Sebastian Kuechlin
I'm a medical student and currently in my fourth year of studies. What fascinates me about synthetic biology is the engineering aspect: I love reconsidering the knowledge I have learned thus far in my medical education and applying it in new ways: Participating in iGEM has altered my way of thinking about biology for good. When I'm not in the hospital, the lecture halls or labs, I love making music and have found a wonderful opportunity to do so as a piano player in our university's big band.""
Fabian Stritt
I have completed two years of my bachelor of science curriculum in biology in Freiburg and will continue my studies in Strasburg in a bioengineering program. It was my interest in the synthetic aspects of biology, which motivated me to join the iGEM team. My particular contribution to our project was the organization of the film project, the result of which you can see on our website, as well as the representation of our team in Berlin at the 'Biotechnologie2020+' . For me, iGEM was a valuable experience which strengthened my wish to become a bioengineer. >
Philipp Warmer
This is a TALE about Philipp who grew up to become a bioengineer. Once upon a time this Philipp started studying biology at Freiburg University and got very attracted to the beauty that resides within the simplicity of SynBio. As he got older he joined the freiGEM Team to take part in the world wide challenge for SynBio. And so he and the freiGEM Team lived happily ever after... See you all at the Jamboree!
Jan Patrick Steitz
I´m a third year student of pharmaceutics, so most of the time I have to deal with chemistry. iGEM gave me a great opportunity to gain experience on the subject of synthetic biology and, of course, it was a lot of fun.
Leo Scheller
I studied molecular medicine in Freiburg and I just moved to Edinburgh for Systems and Synthetic Biology. I hope to integrate Systems and Synthetic Biology into medical research and iGEM has been a great opportunity for gathering practical skills, for being creative, and for getting to know very cool people. Also I'm happy that we have a very promising project and I look forward to our presentation in Amsterdam.
Dennis Grishin
I study molecular medicine and microelectromechanical systems. With this choice of fields of study my goal is to bring life sciences and engineering together. When I heard about iGEM I realized that for me it would be the perfect opportunity to pursue this objective. I am fascinated by synthetic biology and believe in the great potential of biological engineering approaches. freiGEM 2012 gave me the opportunity to take part in an exciting project and to further develop my lab skills. It was a lot of fun and I have very much enjoyed the work in our team.
Verena Waehle
During the time of my bachelor studies in molecular medicine, I learned a lot about the function of cells as well as of whole organisms. Nevertheless, the field of synthetic biology remained something impalpable for me. When I first heard about iGEM, I was intrigued by the concept, that a group of students should plan and realize a whole project in the context of synthetic biology almost on their own. Considering this a challenge and a great opportunity to broaden my horizon by emerging into a research area that differs profoundly from everything I have done before, I joined in on the team. During the whole iGEM year, I was able to learn a lot about almost any aspect of research life, which is what makes the time with freiGEM such an invaluable experience.  I really enjoy the opportunity to be part of such a fabulous project and of an even more fabulous team!
Josip Herman
I´m studying molecular medicine and I was curious about iGEM. iGEM gives me the opportunity to get first insights into the emerging field of synthetic biology, which will very likely influence our future lives. During the time as a freiGEM team member I earned a lot of lab experience and enjoyed the time in the team. May the TALs be with you. See you.
David Fuchs
Biology is going synthetic and it's going there fast. It poses many new and exciting frontiers, so joining in on such a high profile competition as iGEM came natural. Working with people from every corner of the life science landscape and beyond was an eye-opening experience. I learned quite a bit about every facet of lab life during my time with freiGEM, which is what makes this whole endeavor so invaluable. Cheers to all.
Human Practice
Pablo Grassi
I will try to make a long story short: I obtained a bachelor´s degree in biology and I´m currently studying philosophy. I joined the freiGEM-team because of just two reasons. On the one hand, since 2010 I organize an interdisciplinary project at the University of Freiburg concerning the concept of life. In this project, I intend to combine theoretical biology and philosophy of biology to encounter the phenomena of the living. On the other hand, I specialized in the fields of synthetic biology and biochemistry during my bachelor studies. Through combination of these two aspects, the iGEM competition revealed itself as an unique chance for exploring arising philosophical questions concerning our understanding of life. I was lucky I had the possibility to be a member of this great team, which lively promoted philosophical reflection and precise thinking.
Advisors
Dr. Susanne Proksch
I have joined the iGEM team as an advisor to share my research experience with the younger team members. After studying dental medicine, and post doctoral work in Paris, I´m currently doing research on regenerative dentistry at the Clinic for Oral & Maxillofacial Surgery of the “Uniklinik Freiburg”. I decided to participate in the iGEM competition due to my enthusiasm, curiosity and passion for the world of science and my tremendous thirst for new knowledge. Furthermore, it is a great experience to get in touch with the initiative, creativity and cleverness of the undergraduate students which is quite impressive. I got to know synthetic biology as a fascinating field of research and I´m really grateful for this superb experience – Chapeau freiGEM 2012!

Angela Chen
Angela is a sophomore in Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering. This is her second year in iGEM. She wanted to return to iGEM because she craved the experience of working with a group of fellow undergraduates that shared the same passion for synthetic biology. She also wanted to acquire the valuable experience of managing a team to create something extraordinary in synthetic biology.There are two things that make her happy: seeing transformed colonies on her culture plates, or seeing the ominous red ink traced in a shape of an ""A"" at the top right hand corner of her chemistry exam. Aside from academics, Angela enjoys volunteering around the world. She is able to extend a hand to those less fortunate as well as learn more herself in the process. When she feels depressed, she likes to lock herself in her room with a pint of chocolate ice-cream.

Bob Chen
Bob is this year's team's webmaster. He had always been into cutting edge technology and loves the fact that he is able to work on biology in ways that would have been considered in the not-too-distant past. He thinks iGEM is one of the best opportunities around get undergraduate research done in a relatively young field with incredible potential. As a freshman studying Molecular and Cellular Biology he hopes one day to contribute to the scientific progress of humanity through research. Besides having interests in the sciences, he enjoys experiencing all things Sci-Fi, the cultures of East Asia, the sounds of jazz (especially those of Brazil), and the excitement of e-sports. Also Reddit. A lot of Reddit.
Anthony Chau
Anthony is a junior in Biochemistry. This is his first year in iGEM. He decided to join iGEM because he felt that synthetic biology possessed a potential that has an unprecedented power in influencing the future of biology. He wanted to apply his knowledge and imagination into building innovative biological circuits that could have novel functions and applications. The idea of working with a team of undergraduates to probe the vast potential of synthetic biology seemed truly fascinating as well. In addition, he found the iGEM logo curiously attractive. Anthony is an avid squash player. He also enjoys watching movies that make him smile, laugh, or cry. Lastly, he finds it immensely difficult to decide between a freshly prepared piece of sweet hamachi sushi or a delicately seared piece of medium-rare, rib-eye steak.
Asha Kirchhoff
Asha is a freshman in Bioengineering and this year’s iGEM secretary. Her interest in genetic engineering and awesome science led her to the iGEM team, and she’s thrilled to be working with some of the most intelligent and passionate people she has ever met! Being a part of iGEM is also exciting because she views the future of synthetic biology to be full of novel applications in personalized medicine, humanitarian aid, biotechnology and beyond. Outside of iGEM, Asha volunteers with the Society of Women Engineers, watches Dr. Who and the Big Bang Theory with friends, dances around her dorm room, and maintains her nerd street cred through terrible jokes.
Uros Kuzmanovic
My name's Uros Kuzmanovic, a Junior studying Molecular and Cellular Biology. This is my first year at iGEM where I seek to not only learn the applications and procedures of synthetic biology, but also collaborate with bright individuals to design a novel project. This blurb feels too impersonal to state something personal, but something too impersonal would be uninformative, quite the conundrum. If I could, I would sit down and have coffee with you. All the best!
Adi Malik
Adi is a Junior in Bioengineering, and the Corporate Director of this year's iGEM team. He joined iGEM because of a deep interest in biotechnology, genetics and engineering. He also has an interest in business and entrepreneurship, and is spearheading the effort in this year's entrepreneurship division. All in all, he believes iGEM provides a unique opportunity to develop something, with fellow undergraduates, that can have a tangible, positive impact on the world of synthetic biology. Aside from iGEM, Adi is an undergraduate researcher and consultant with Illinois Business Consulting. He enjoys playing the guitar, running, playing basketball and figuring out creative ways to waste time.
Isiah Ramos
Isiah Ramos attended highschool at the Illinois Math and Science Academy in Aurora, IL. He is the Lab manager of the 2012 Illinois iGEM team. His major is Agricultural and Biological Engineering, and he intends to focus on Nanotechnology. He hopes to one day research genetics in order to understand genetic disorders and how to treat them
Cara Schornak
Cara Schornak, a freshman in MCBH, is excited to be on the 2012 Illinois iGEM team. She hails from the St. Louis, MO area, and is proud to bring her own diversity to the team. Cara first became interested in biology in general when she was a freshman in high school. She was inspired by the Punnett Square’s ability to predict the phenotype of the offspring of two individuals and was later drawn to epigenetics through a NOVA science episode. The field of synthetic biology also intrigued her after she heard about J. Craig Venter’s work in California and his tenacious work ethic. Cara worked for approximately two years at Washington University in St. Louis as a laboratory assistant in Dr. Doug Chalker’s lab. There she met her greatest inspiration, a Mr. Scott Horrell, who became her mentor and adviser. Horrell encouraged her to attend the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign where she thrives in the rigorous and diverse atmosphere. When she is not in class, lab, or the library, Cara enjoys musical performances, lounging on the Quad, drinking tea, reading period novels, supporting the Illini, and sampling the ethnic cuisine on campus
Divya Tankasala
I'm a freshman at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, and I'm majoring in Bioengineering, with an intended track focus on biomechanics. I learned about iGEM through another organization I'm involved in - the Society of Women Engineers. I decided to apply for iGEM because I found it to be very unique when compared to normal undergraduate research work. As a bioengineer, I'm really excited to be part of a student-run research competition associated with synthetic biology and genetic engineering! In my free time, I blog (tumblr), read just about any random article I find lying around, blast an eclectic variety music through my noise-cancelling headphones, handle various alumni relations as a member of SWE and Engineering Student Ambassadors, eat like a machine, and work until obscene hours of the night. Go iGEM!

As a bioengineer, I'm really excited to be part of a student-run research competition associated with synthetic biology and genetic engineering! In my free time, I blog (tumblr), read just about any random article I find lying around, blast an eclectic variety music through my noise-cancelling headphones, handle various alumni relations as a member of SWE and Engineering Student Ambassadors, eat like a machine, and work until obscene hours of the night. Go iGEM!

iGEM rocks so badly, when you do it once, you just wanna do it again :)
But this year, I'm keeping a low profile, just helping out the newbies to settle in and feel comfy in the lab. I'm still enjoying working around bacteria, apart from B. subtilis producing lysostaphin, because it smells so badly you just wanna die when you happen to be working in the same room!
I also like playing volleyball, cooking, baking, eating and above all traveling and meeting new people ^^ See y'all at the Jamboree!
Bastien Doix
I am a third-year student in Biochemistry and Biotechnology at INSA Lyon and taking part in iGEM for the first time. I am joining the iGEM team to have a first sight of what genetics and bacterial manipulation is and to step into something different from studies. I like sports, skiing and computer graphics and hope to make it to Boston.
Alexandre Duprey
This year, I’m back for another iGEM competition. I’m still at INSA Lyon, fourth-year biochemistry and biotechnology, and still interested in how we can regulate parts to make them work together. However this time I’m rather advising on the project with the intent to improve our weak points (who said modelling ?), and making sure the newcomers don’t make (too many) mistakes. Otherwise I play video games. A lot. Too much...
Patricia Gifu
I am an undergraduate student in Biochemistry and Biotechnology at INSA de Lyon. This year, I participate for the first time in iGEM.  I am very confident that INSA Lyon team is going to win because the team members worked very hard on the project and they all are skillful. I am passionate by biosciences. Outside the school I like watching movies and traveling whenever I have time.
Carine Gimbert
Also known as Stoatix, it is my first participation in the INSA-Lyon team. In my previous studies, I worked on two projects about bioremediation and production of vanillin using biotechnology. So being part of the iGEM team is really important to continue learning how to manage bacteria and working in a student team. I am fond of dance, photography and art in general. I live in a town where the international short film festival takes place : Clermont-Ferrand and one of my favorite is “la révolution des crabes”
Clémence Gonthier
When you participate in iGEM once, you just want to take part in this great adventure again !
In my fourth year of Biochemistry and Biotechnology, I’m still enjoying microbiology, modifying bacteria and creating new plasmids! I’m this time on the advisor side... Helping the new team members searching for sponsors and guiding them for experiments in the lab.
In my free time, I like dancing, playing the piano and traveling !
Anne Haziza
I am a third-year student in Biochemistry and Biotechnologies at INSA Lyon. I am taking part in the iGEM competition for the first time. This project is a good way for me to improve my organization skills, ingenuity and dynamism which will be very useful for the future. Outside of school, I enjoy cooking, playing handball and mainly traveling whenever possible! So I believe on the talent of her team to discover Amsterdam and of course Boston!
Rémi Hocq
I am also known as Clumsix for often being … clumsy. Hell, I am the kind of guy who managed to cut my finger trying to open a bottle of beer and for the record, I was actually using a bottle-opener. My clumsiness is even contagious : Gaël and Yoann also cut their finger during the summer. Anyway, I am also a third-year bioengineering student who love music (especially hard rock !), good food (though I am skinny and absolutely don't know why) and traveling. I may be a bit of a nerd too as I am a videogames fanatic.
Audrey Masi
Also known as Squirrelix because I used to climb up on trees and hide in narrow cupboards to make jokes to my friends. I am a third-year bioengineer. I am joining the IGEM team after a first experience in molecular biology to improve my knowledge and discover the synthetic biology approach. Outside of iGEM, I am interested in rock dance, cooking, traveling, and above all that literature.
Alex Mizgier
Also known as Hairix, I am a third-year biochemist at INSA Lyon. I am from Chile, specifically from the northern limit of Western Patagonia.
I got into the iGEM project because I think that it’s an unique experience and an excellent opportunity to learn more about bacterial manipulation and synthetic biology.
Apart from microbiology, I like reading, playing rugby, bicycle touring, and everything that involves nature and outdoor activities. You will find in me a knight-errant.
Béryl Royer-Bertrand
This is my second participation in the iGEM competition with the INSA Lyon team. In fourth year in Bioinformatics and Modeling, I’m helping this year the team in the modelling part from Scotland, where I am in academic exchange.
Ioana Sandu
I am a third-year Biochemistry student. I decided to join the Lyon team because I believe that the iGEM competition is a challenging experience that will put myself to the test. Apart from synthetic biology, I like dancing, star-gazing and reading while listening to music (the older, the better).
Xavier Tholot
I am a third-year student in computer sciences at INSA Lyon.
I come from Clermont-Ferrand, the city where Michelin was created, which isn't far from Lyon.
I am fond of music (I play the guitar and the clarinet), and also of computers : this year, I joined the Lyon-INSA team to help them improving their wiki, and make it as great as possible. ).
Marion Traouan
I am an undergraduate student in biochemistry and biotechnologies at INSA Lyon. This is my first participation in an iGEM team. I consider this as an opportunity not only  to acquire specific qualifications very useful for the future, but also to participate in the construction of an attractive project from scratch.
Besides my interest in biosciences, I am into sports like basket-ball or volley-ball,  reading and cinema. I hope my ""blondness"" won't be an obstacle to the realization of this project.
Marion Wolfovski
Also known as Rasberrix Olympix, I have a bachelor's degree in Sciences and I am now studying Biochemistry and Biotechnologies. This is my first participation in the iGEM competition. I love new challenges and iGEM is an amazing opportunity to manage together my passion for biology and building a project : a scientific adventure. I love sports and making cookies for my lovely team !

Romain Briandet
I am the leader of the biofilm group at the INRA Micalis Institute. I have focused my research on microbial biofilms present in the food chain with special emphasis on their role in the persistence of pathogens. One of my main scientific line of interest is to identify the link between the 3D spatial organization of biofilms and the survival mechanisms of cells in face to the exposition of antimicrobials. Recently, my team reported that a tiny proportion of certain Bacillus species can tunnel through biofilms, creating pores that allow molecules to flow in. We are now evaluating the industrial benefit to pretreat target biofilms with swimming Bacilli cocktails to increase their efficacy and reduced their ecological impact.
Gaël Chambonnier
Hi everybody, here is Chambix!! I just graduated from the INSA Lyon in Biotechnologies but after two participations at the iGEM Competition, I couldn’t do anything but continue my studies with a master in bioinformatics. After two years working in the lab for the team, I came back this year trying to help out the new team, sharing my experiences. Actually, they didn’t really need my help. They’ve done a great job with Bacillix. And for sure you’ll have to deal with them in Amsterdam and Boston.
Fanny Springer
I've joined the INSA-Lyon team this year to see how we can change the world using genetically engineered material !
Philippe Thomas
This year, Asterix and his friends have travelled until Buenos Aires in Argentina... They meet some strange people living riding horses, drinking mate, eating very good meat and raising cows in the infinite pampa! I’m one of this gauchos! I‘m currently working in Buenos Aires for 18 months as an Engineer in biotechnology in Sanofi Pasteur. As it is not so easy to assist meeting and perform some experiments, the best for me was to be an advisor! I try to help out my Gallic friends when some extra work is needed and give my best as advisor, sharing my experiences of the iGEM competition with them! El hombre de la pampa can’t wait to see the Lyon Biosciences Team rockin’ Amsterdam and Boston with our very powerfull bacteria!
Instructors
Olivier Brette
Valérie Desjardin
Corinne Dorel
Yoann Louis
Philippe Oger
Agnès Rodrigue
Olivier Brette
Associate Professor in economics at the Institut National des Sciences Appliquées (INSA) de Lyon
I teach the ""economics of firm"", ""innovation economics"", as well as the ""economics of globalization"" to engineering students.
I am affiliated with the CNRS Research Unit ""Environment, City, Society"" (EVS), where I pursue my research activities in theoretical and applied economics. From a theoretical viewpoint, my research work aims at developing the methodological, conceptual, as well as behavioral foundations of Institutional and Evolutionary Economics. I resort to this theoretical framework to deal with different kinds of issues in innovation economics and economic geography.
Valérie Desjardin
Associate professor at the Institut National des Sciences Appliquées de Lyon
After a Master of Advanced Studies in Biochemistry and a PhD in Chemistry and Science and Techniques of waste, now I teach Chemistry classes and also a class dealing with radioactive waste management in the Energy Engineering and Environment department.
My research work at the Laboratory of Civil engineering and Environmental engineering (LGCIE) is currently aimed at the study of biophysicochemical interactions of pollutants in various compounds (soils, sediments, municipal solid waste) using molecular biology tools. I am very excited to take part in the iGEM 2012 project which leads to the development of a synergy, already launched, between the Biosciences department and Environmental sciences.
Corinne Dorel
My teaching activities in the Microbial Genetics mainly take place within the Biosciences department at INSA Lyon, but also at the Ecole Normale Supérieur de Lyon and at the University Claude Bernard Lyon 1.
My research work is based on the understanding of genetic mechanisms involved in the formation of biofilms and the contamination of materials. Being the Communications officer for the Biosciences department, my participation in iGEM 2012 is part of a strategy to promote and share knowledge in the field of research in genetic engineering and more generally in Biological Sciences.
Yoann Louis
Young ;) ) Associate professor at the Institut National des Sciences Appliquées de Lyon
Up to now my work is focused on the trace metal behavior in the environment and their interaction with dissolved organic matter in aquatic ecosystems.
Now my work at the LGCIE laboratory is mainly to study trace metals/ organic matter behavior in various waste and to give an expertise on their potential toxicity depending on the bio-physico-chemical conditions of the studied site. As a chemist, my interest in the iGEM project is to have a working approach angle allowing the improvements of our environment thanks to our complementarity.
Philippe Oger
Also known as Piezophilix because I work on high-pressure adaptation in microorganisms. My research is focussed on adaptation mechanisms in microbes from the deep-biosphere, and mainly in Archaea isolated from deep-sea hydrothermal vent systems. Our aim is to identify and quantify what genetic modifications make our favorite model, Pyrococcus yanaosii, require 500 times the atmospheric pressure for growth, when everybody else's favorite lab rat, E. coli, cannot even growth at the same hydrostatic pressure. My teaching activities at the University of Lyon deal with petroleum reservoir microbiology and the use of biosignatures for the study of past and present environments.
Agnès Rodrigue
As an associate professor I find that iGEM is an unique experience, a place to mix teaching and practice in a long term project relying on students’ motivation. My teaching interests are microbiology, molecular biology, protein engineering  and bioinformatics.
My research topic focus on understanding the molecular mechanisms involved in  bacterial adaptation to a  metal-rich environment, from molecular interactions to population biology. Apart from the basic approaches, this subject offers also  the opportunity to develop biological tools for the bioremediation of spoiled environment or the in situ detection of toxic compounds for instance, developments which I’m interested in. My motivation for iGEM is the same: conception and application.

I am also known as the Clumsy one. Hell, I am the kind of guy who managed to cut my finger trying to open a bottle of beer and for the record, I was actually using a bottle-opener. My clumsiness is even contagious : Gaël and Yoann also cut their finger during the summer. Anyway, I am also a third-year bioengineering student who love music (especially hard rock !), good food (though I am skinny and absolutely don't know why) and traveling. I may be a bit of a nerd too as I am a videogames fanatic.
Audrey Masi
Also known as the Red Squirrel because I used to climb up on trees and hide in narrow cupboards to make jokes to my friends. I am a third-year bioengineer. I am joining the IGEM team after a first experience in molecular biology to improve my knowledge and discover the synthetic biology approach. Outside of iGEM, I am interested in rock dance, cooking, traveling, and above all that literature.
Alex Mizgier
Also known as the Guanaco, I am a third-year biochemist at INSA Lyon. I am from Chile, specifically from the northern limit of Western Patagonia.
I got into the iGEM project because I think that it’s an unique experience and an excellent opportunity to learn more about bacterial manipulation and synthetic biology.
Apart from microbiology, I like reading, playing rugby, bicycle touring, and everything that involves nature and outdoor activities. You will find in me a knight-errant.
Béryl Royer-Bertrand
This is my second participation in the iGEM competition with the INSA Lyon team. In fourth year in Bioinformatics and Modeling, I’m helping this year the team in the modelling part from Scotland, where I am in academic exchange.
Ioana Sandu
I am a third-year Biochemistry student. I decided to join the Lyon team because I believe that the iGEM competition is a challenging experience that will put myself to the test. Apart from synthetic biology, I like dancing, star-gazing and reading while listening to music (the older, the better).
Xavier Tholot
I am a third-year student in computer sciences at INSA Lyon.
I come from Clermont-Ferrand, the city where Michelin was created, which isn't far from Lyon.
I am fond of music (I play the guitar and the clarinet), and also of computers : this year, I joined the Lyon-INSA team to help them improve their wiki, and make it as great as possible. ).
Marion Traouan
I am an undergraduate student in biochemistry and biotechnologies at INSA Lyon. This is my first participation in an iGEM team. I consider this as an opportunity not only  to acquire specific qualifications very useful for the future, but also to participate in the construction of an attractive project from scratch.
Besides my interest in biosciences, I am into sports like basket-ball or volley-ball,  reading and cinema. I hope my ""blondness"" won't be an obstacle to the realization of this project.
Marion Wolfovski
I have a bachelor's degree in Sciences and I am now studying Biochemistry and Biotechnologies. This is my first participation in the iGEM competition. I love new challenges and iGEM is an amazing opportunity to manage together my passion for biology and building a project : a scientific adventure. I love sports and making cookies for my lovely team !

Romain Briandet
I am the leader of the biofilm group at the INRA Micalis Institute. I have focused my research on microbial biofilms present in the food chain with special emphasis on their role in the persistence of pathogens. One of my main scientific line of interest is to identify the link between the 3D spatial organization of biofilms and the survival mechanisms of cells in face to the exposition of antimicrobials. Recently, my team reported that a tiny proportion of certain Bacillus species can tunnel through biofilms, creating pores that allow molecules to flow in. We are now evaluating the industrial benefit to pretreat target biofilms with swimming Bacilli cocktails to increase their efficacy and reduced their ecological impact.
Gaël Chambonnier
Hi everybody, here is Chambi!! I just graduated from the INSA Lyon in Biotechnologies but after two participations at the iGEM Competition, I couldn’t do anything but continue my studies with a master in bioinformatics. After two years working in the lab for the team, I came back this year trying to help out the new team, sharing my experiences. Actually, they didn’t really need my help. They’ve done a great job with Biofilm Killer. And for sure you’ll have to deal with them in Amsterdam and Boston.
Fanny Springer
I've joined the INSA-Lyon team this year to see how we can change the world using genetically engineered material !
Philippe Thomas
This year, Biofilm Killer has travelled until Buenos Aires in Argentina... They meet some strange people living riding horses, drinking mate, eating very good meat and raising cows in the infinite pampa! I’m one of this gauchos! I‘m currently working in Buenos Aires for 18 months as an Engineer in biotechnology in Sanofi Pasteur. As it is not so easy to assist meeting and perform some experiments, the best for me was to be an advisor! I try to help out my Gallic friends when some extra work is needed and give my best as advisor, sharing my experiences of the iGEM competition with them! El hombre de la pampa can’t wait to see the Lyon Biosciences Team rockin’ Amsterdam and Boston with our very powerfull bacteria!

Valérie Desjardin
Corinne Dorel
Yoann Louis
Philippe Oger
Agnès Rodrigue
Olivier Brette
Associate Professor in economics at the Institut National des Sciences Appliquées (INSA) de Lyon
I teach the ""economics of firm"", ""innovation economics"", as well as the ""economics of globalization"" to engineering students.
I am affiliated with the CNRS Research Unit ""Environment, City, Society"" (EVS), where I pursue my research activities in theoretical and applied economics. From a theoretical viewpoint, my research work aims at developing the methodological, conceptual, as well as behavioral foundations of Institutional and Evolutionary Economics. I resort to this theoretical framework to deal with different kinds of issues in innovation economics and economic geography.
Valérie Desjardin
Associate professor at the Institut National des Sciences Appliquées de Lyon
After a Master of Advanced Studies in Biochemistry and a PhD in Chemistry and Science and Techniques of waste, now I teach Chemistry classes and also a class dealing with radioactive waste management in the Energy Engineering and Environment department.
My research work at the Laboratory of Civil engineering and Environmental engineering (LGCIE) is currently aimed at the study of biophysicochemical interactions of pollutants in various compounds (soils, sediments, municipal solid waste) using molecular biology tools. I am very excited to take part in the iGEM 2012 project which leads to the development of a synergy, already launched, between the Biosciences department and Environmental sciences.
Corinne Dorel
My teaching activities in the Microbial Genetics mainly take place within the Biosciences department at INSA Lyon, but also at the Ecole Normale Supérieur de Lyon and at the University Claude Bernard Lyon 1.
My research work is based on the understanding of genetic mechanisms involved in the formation of biofilms and the contamination of materials. Being the Communications officer for the Biosciences department, my participation in iGEM 2012 is part of a strategy to promote and share knowledge in the field of research in genetic engineering and more generally in Biological Sciences.
Yoann Louis
Young ;) ) Associate professor at the Institut National des Sciences Appliquées de Lyon
Up to now my work is focused on the trace metal behavior in the environment and their interaction with dissolved organic matter in aquatic ecosystems.
Now my work at the LGCIE laboratory is mainly to study trace metals/ organic matter behavior in various waste and to give an expertise on their potential toxicity depending on the bio-physico-chemical conditions of the studied site. As a chemist, my interest in the iGEM project is to have a working approach angle allowing the improvements of our environment thanks to our complementarity.
Philippe Oger
Also known as the man under pressure because I work on high-pressure adaptation in microorganisms. My research is focussed on adaptation mechanisms in microbes from the deep-biosphere, and mainly in Archaea isolated from deep-sea hydrothermal vent systems. Our aim is to identify and quantify what genetic modifications make our favorite model, Pyrococcus yanaosii, require 500 times the atmospheric pressure for growth, when everybody else's favorite lab rat, E. coli, cannot even growth at the same hydrostatic pressure. My teaching activities at the University of Lyon deal with petroleum reservoir microbiology and the use of biosignatures for the study of past and present environments.
Agnès Rodrigue
As an associate professor I find that iGEM is an unique experience, a place to mix teaching and practice in a long term project relying on students’ motivation. My teaching interests are microbiology, molecular biology, protein engineering  and bioinformatics.
My research topic focus on understanding the molecular mechanisms involved in  bacterial adaptation to a  metal-rich environment, from molecular interactions to population biology. Apart from the basic approaches, this subject offers also  the opportunity to develop biological tools for the bioremediation of spoiled environment or the in situ detection of toxic compounds for instance, developments which I’m interested in. My motivation for iGEM is the same: conception and application.

Our Team
Our Team
We were very lucky this year to have a diverse group of students with a diverse skill set. Some of our students are new to the iGEM team while others are joining us again in our research endeavors.
Alvin Lee
I am currently majoring in Biochemistry at the University of Lethbridge, and I will be entering my second year in the fall. This will be my first year contending in the iGEM competition. I joined the UofL iGEM team to exploit the many opportunities it has to offer. And so far, the program is very rewarding: it allows me to explore an alternative and fascinating field of biology, and provides me with the privilege of working alongside and learning from veteran iGEMers. But enough of the science-y stuff! When I’m not working in the Kothe RNA lab or the iGEM lab, you can find me on the battlegrounds defending the Sanctuary from the Prime Evils or living vicariously through the Game of Thrones series. But aside from the medieval fantasy, I also enjoy hiking, and playing badminton.
Anthony Vuong
Anthony Vuong, that is my full name. I am brother to the one with the same surname (Ben). Majoring in Biology; the University of Lethbridge I am attending. This will be my last year—oh my, so near the ending. Also, this is my third year iGEMing. A single beer is all it takes for a crimson glow to grace my face. A common problem, they do say, for the people of my race. For me, it is a bother, though not one for my younger brother. Is it ironic that “Red” is my favourite colour? Some may say I have a unique sense of fashion. Though shy I once was, not one for social interaction. But now, others shout “Eccentric” whilst smirking at my actions. A lion’s head, I may embellish in a dance of which I do so relish—a musical exhibition originating from the Chinese tradition (Chinese Lion Dance).
Ben Vuong
I was born and raised in Lethbridge. I have just finished up my second year at the University of Lethbridge currently majoring in Neuroscience. This is my second year participating in the iGEM collegiate division, as well as my first year as an advisor for the 2012 Lethbridge High School Division team. I plan on pursuing a career as a Veterinarian after finishing up my undergraduate degree at the University of Lethbridge. I look forward to working with all the other team members and any other labs we have the opportunity to collaborate with.  In my spare time I find myself enjoying badminton, basketball and exercising.
Boris Lam
Lambo is back once again!
This will be the second time in all of iGEM history! Returning from the great iGEM experience I had in 2011.  This will be my fourth year of university where I am currently majoring in neuroscience.  When I am not sweating over a bunsen burner or mass murdering bacteria in lab, you can find me on the battlefield wearing shiny sneakers and protecting the entire human race from supernatural beings with just a mere xbox controller. On my days off, I enjoy jamming/dancing to music (not in public of course ^_^), playing hockey, golfing and any kind of sport in general.  I look forward in meeting everyone at the Jamboree this year!
PAYCE!!!
Dustin Smith
Hi! I'm Dustin. I was born and raised in Lethbridge, and this is my final year as an undergraduate majoring in biochemistry. This is my second year in iGEM, and as always it has been a great experience. The U of L iGEM team is a great group to work with and I'm happy to be a part of it. Outside of school my favourite activities are snowboarding, working out, or hanging out with friends.
Harland ""the Cowboy"" Brandon
This young cowboy has lived for several years on canned beans and buffalo jerky whilst on the pursuit of fortune along the rivers of southern Alberta. Armed with only his quick wit and his two “hand gunz” (see picture) has he been able to survive day to day in the rolling coulees he calls home. Some say that his smile has the power to scare packs of coyotes away while still able to lure deer into his striking range. While he has given up the solitary life of a rogue cowboy for life in a research lab he has not given up his true identity as the lone ranger in these parts. His dreams include designing and building a synthetic biology project with space application such that he may one day become a space cowboy. Seriously, he does want to invent and/or help invent a space synthetic biology project!
Ryan Pederson
Entombed by walls of monolithic stone while barred from vistas of bucolic plateaus regularly interspersed with the linear and euclidean masonry of modernity awash in the scintillating light of a gibbous moon occluded by peripatetic clouds, I toil on my work as scion of Darwin and Mendel peering at incalculable numbers of lilliputian bulbous creatures of peculiar properties imposed upon them by the contriving mind of man in the midst of a rancour of vacuous ribald jest and interminable pedantic criticism, precisely the sort pernicious and incessant buzzing that produces a deleterious effect on those possessing particularly sensitive sensibilities of the anachronistic variety. Or, in non-Lovecraftian speak, I work in a synthetic biology lab with no windows and discussions by me and my lab-mates are not always suitable for all audiences.
Sutherland Dube
Hey, I’m Sutherland (yes, that is my first name) and I just completed my undergrad in Neuroscience and will be beginning grad school in the fall. This is my second year on the Lethbridge iGEM team, in addition to being an advisor for the 2012 Lethbridge High School team. iGEM has been a great experience over the past couple of years— I’ve learned a ton! When I’m not in the lab (either neuroscience or iGEM), I love playing soccer and reading.
Richard McLean
Howdy y’all! I’m Richard and I’m entering my fourth year of biochemistry at the U of L. I spent a few years out of school before last fall exploring the culinary world so now I spend most of my time trying to catch up on my studies; The rest of my time I divide between iGem and the local Research Center. I like to think that if I wasn’t as busy, I would fill my free time with activities that would make this bio a more interesting read… At any rate, I’m looking forward to meeting everyone at the workshops and jamboree.
Jenna Friedt - Advisor
Hello! I am a graduate student at the U of L currently completing my Masters degree in Biochemistry and am looking forward to my second year participating in the iGEM competition. Since I’m convinced I was born in the wrong era, I’m currently looking for assistance in inventing a time machine to send me back to the ‘50s, where I would happily fit in with the bubblegum rockers and poodle skirt-wearing youth of the day. Until that happens, I’m content to read a good book, knit, or do crossword puzzles to pass the time outside the lab. Best wishes!
Fan Mo - Advisor
Fan currently works as a lab technician in the Wieden lab. In her spare time she likes to play badminton, computer games and dancing in the rain. She currently holds the title for best score playing gold miner among the Wieden lab. This is her third year in iGEM as a supervisor and looks forward to another year on the team.
Dipankar Goyal
Fellow iGemers, we all know Synthetic Biology has moving applications, solutions to problems that may go unresolved otherwise. I have been extremely fortunate to have been a part of the U of L iGEM for two years now and I can say the experience has been absolutely magnificent. Synthetic Biology defines one part of me; I also have keen interest in the field of medicine especially programs such as the Doctors without Borders. In my spare time, if any, I am either figuring out ways to park free of cost at the university or paying university parking tickets downtown.
Nathan Dawson
Hello! I’m Nathan a student at the University of Lethbridge, currently entering my second year of Neuroscience. One thing I’ve long known about myself is that I love the sciences, so when I found an opportunity to volunteer in a biochemistry lab this spring I took it without hesitation. Through the volunteer experience I gained a wealth of knowledge (something I’m always hungry for), and a desire to continue exploring the opportunities at the university, for more learning experiences. Being on the University of Lethbridge’s iGEM team has been a gateway to the exciting world of synthetic biology. When I’m not in one of the labs (Ute Kothe’s, or iGEM), I enjoy reading, biking, scuba diving, snowboarding, and volunteering with St. John Ambulance.
Iain Barkley
A 3rd year neuroscience major with an interests in synthetic biology for biomedical applications, in particular by engineering and modifying genetic circuits to facilitate enhanced communication and information processing between cells. Iain wishes to design more refined methods for neurobiological research by building upon the pre-existing knowledge of synthetic biology principles. He is captivated by iGEM because he believes it acts not only as a nexus for innovative and extraordinary applications that will shape and define the 21st century, but is a community rich in intellectual resources through which undergraduates previously had limited access to. He plans to pursue a career in biomedical research focusing on creating new treatments for neurodegenerative disorders.
Isaac Ward
Hello, I am a 3rd year Neuroscience major, and looking to gain all the experience I can in my undergrad career.  So I am back for a second year of iGEM.  I think iGEM provides great opportunities to diversify my skill set and while opening the doors to new possibilities.    As an example this year I got the opportunity to be an advisor for the first Lethbridge High School iGEM team, it was an amazing experience to say the least. When I am not busy in the labs (like that ever happens), I enjoy being out having great adventures.
Jenn Huynh
Hello world! My name is Jennifer and I have currently only slogged through three full years of my major, Biochemistry. I have just recently been sucked into this whirling vortex of a world known as iGEM due to many persuasive arguments and have not yet lived to regret such a decision (which is a good thing). Hopefully the science and technology, that will further our lives in the very near future, will keep the remainder of the summer and the beginnings of autumn refreshing and fascinating. In the mean time while I am not slaving away in the lab I will occupy my time with catching up on sleep that I have missed during my time as a real student of the University of Lethbridge. It’s a pleasure to introduce myself and hopefully new friendships will emerge in the nearby future. Peace out … for now.
Justin Luu
I am an undergraduate student at the University of Lethbridge. I will be going into my second of four years in the B.Sc Biochemistry program. This is my first year competing in the iGEM competition and I am extremely excited. When I am not in the lab I enjoy sleeping, eating and spending time with family/friends. Oh wait! Movies are pretty good too! Thanks for taking the time to read my bio.
Katherine Gzyl
Hi I’m Katherine, and I am in my fourth year of biochemistry at the U of L. In my free time, when I have any, I enjoy snowboarding and the outdoors. I got involved with iGEM last year, because synthetic biology fascinated me. I find anything to do with science interesting, and iGEM was a great way to get into research. This year I have stayed on the team because we have a very interesting project and a team composed of some awesome people.
Makay Murray
Hi, my name is Makay Murray (and yes there is to letter ‘c’ in my name, but everyone thinks there should be) I’m currently collecting pre-requisites for Radiology which I plan to take in 2013. I was invited onto iGEM by Isaac and felt that actually working with bacteria in a lab would be very enlightening to know the deeper workings of cellular activity and how to manipulate these natural processes to create something new. While at school I am also the host of a CKXU 88.3fm radio show entitled University Power Users where I talk about stuff that I think students should know but will never be taught in any classroom. When I’m not at school I’m either working at Able Dental Group as a IT tech or enjoying the wonders of technology by playing various videogames like minecraft, DayZ and Halo.
Zak Stinson
Hey, I'm Zak. The only real reason I get up in the morning is the ever-looming eventuality that humanity will integrate with technology, creating a vast, swarm-like intelligence bent on the consumption of whole stellar systems. To help advance us towards our inevitable conquest, I am studying neuroscience and have decided to take part in the iGEM competition this year! This firm belief also explains my obsession with all consumer technology. I occupy the time between now and our eventual fate with bike rides, camping, and dance parties. Oh yeah, and resistance is futile.
Mackenzie Coatham - Advisor
Hi iGEMers! My name is Mackenzie and I’m a fourth year biochemistry major who is competing in iGEM for a THIRD time! I’ve been involved in scientific research since high school and still love every minute of studying proteins in translation or exploring what synthetic biology has to offer. When I’m not in a lab coat holding a pipette, I can often be found dancing or watching my fair share of So You Think You Can Dance!
Hans-Joachim Wieden - Supervisor
Originally from Germany I moved to Canada in 2005 to start a research group on the structure and function of the bacterial protein synthesis machinery, a cellular process targeted by over 50% of the known antibiotics. I am intrigued by the molecular design and function of this essential bio-nanomachine. I try to unravel the underlying design principles in order to enable the rational design and engineering of novel bio-nanomachines. I am essentially asking the question if such novel bio-machines can be constructed from simple and fundamental principles or are these assemblies just to complex. Well and that’s why it was extremely easy to rope me into doing iGEM.

Team:Lethbridge/team/
From 2012.igem.org
2012 iGEM - University of Lethbridge
Our team consists of over twenty members. The members of our team are mainly comprised of undergraduate students ranging from first year to 4th year undergraduates.
And of course our team wouldn't be complete with out the guidance of our graduate student members.
We have all come together to put our best foot forward and compete in this years iGEM competition.
Our Team
Isaac Ward
I am from Edmonton though grew up in the small town of Vermilion. There I never would have thought this would be the path I would eventually end up on, but one thing lead to another and here I am. I am taking my Bachelors of Science in Neuroscience, and find it a very exciting field, with a great cross application to Synthetic biology. I enjoy camping and hiking in the mountains, I love skiing both downhill and cross country, and have coached youth cross country ski in past years. I had heard about iGEM prior to arriving at the U of L, and was very eager to get involved. It has been an extreamly interesting year and I have learned so much.
Ben Vuong
I was born and raised in Lethbridge for the whole span of my life. I have just finished up my first year and will be entering my second year at the University of Lethbridge majoring in Biochemistry. This is my first year with iGEM, and I am looking forward to the knowledge to be gained from the members of the team. I plan on pursuing the career of a Veterinarian after finishing up my undergraduate degree at the University of Lethbridge. Badminton is one of my favourite activities to do. I enjoy listening to contemporary R&B music as well Hip-Hop such as Ne-Yo, Chris Brown, Claude Kelly, Frankie J and Lupe Fiasco.
Anthony Vuong
Anthony Vuong, that is my full name. I am brother to the one with the same surname (Ben). Majoring in Biology; the University of Lethbridge I am attending.

Justin Vigar
I'm Justin. I think biology is way more fun when looking at it though the eyes of an engineer, so synthetic biology is a perfect fit for me. I am very excited to be working full-time for the Lethbridge iGEM team for the second year in a row. When not in the lab I downhill and freeride mountain bike, ride motocross, play guitar, and enjoy walks on the beach in San Francisco.

We are the first Argentinian team to participate in iGEM competition, so everything is new for us! Here we are, ready to work hard on our project!. Meet us, and also check where we come from
Students
Veronica Parasco - Physics Student
I guess I like to study too much, or the stress and making summaries. I'm about to finish my Licentiate in Physics, when I started to think about what was next, I realized that several of the decision I made took me closer to other career fields. So here I am, learning biology and opening new doors.
Mario J. Rugiero - Chemistry and Computer Sciece Student
Initially, the iGEM grabbed my attention through its idea of free thought and colaboration, which I consider should be general rule if we want society to progress. Even though my career choice seems remotely related to synthetic biology, curiosity moves me to learn a little bit about everything, which is never a bad idea.
I'd like to see that this initiative will bring together all the synthetic biology investigation groups in Argentina because I see in this discipline an opportunity to develop and resolve many local, and very important, problems.
María Alejandra Parreño - Biology Student
Within the vast field of Biology, i like ALL study subjects, but my specialty at the moment Biological Ecology of Populations (previously known as Population Genetics). Since 2009, I work in conserving the genetic variability of fruit flies which are a plague in Latin America, and I also do so with other insects with economical importance.
I have another two very strong interests: on one hand, the spread of science, and on the other, the sustainable development of societies and handling of natural and biological resources. So I try to match my academic ocupations with relevant participations in congress and with activities in these two areas. I love competition, innovation, and challenges, which is what attracted me to participate in iGEM and test my abilities. I see an unexplored synthetic biology field in Argentina, with a great potential to solve scientific and social problems, using wits and creativity as the main tools. As a first iGEM group, we want to impulse these ideas into reality and start off with the right foot!
Luciano G. Morosi- Biology Student
I am currently going through my last year, and i've been an intern in an investigation laboratory.  From a very young age, I was passionate and interested in natural sciences, and I decided to study biology because you must have knowledge in all sciences to be able to understand it. In this way, my interest in synthetic biology comes from the fact that it is multidisciplinary, and I'm immensely attracted to the idea of being able to create biological systems – or based in biological parts- that are innovative, which carry out specifically designed actions, using and creating standarized and combined parts. I'm not only attracted to science, but also literature, theater, music and sports: for a very long time I participated in gymnastics and swimming, and I still do the latter. I love to write, I feel comfortable writing social, political and cultural papers, and also stories.
Manuel Giménez - Computer Science Student
I'm writing my licentiate thesis on building a tool to automatically reason about regulations. Yes yes, nothing relates to biology. Weird, right? Nevertheless, I've always had an interest for this discipline, mainly molecular biology. When I found out about the existance of iGEM – a couple of months ago- I said we have to assemble a team in Argentina. Coincidence or not, a week later I got an email inviting me to be a part of the first Argentinian iGEM team, and now I find myself taking my first steps in synthetic biology as a member of iGEM BsAs. I'm mainly interested in the engineering vision that synthetic biology has, and I believe from the computer science standpoint, I have several ideas I can bring to this new subject. I love scientific dissemination and teaching; I consider myself a straightforward communicator, and my natural way of working is in groups. I'm part of a political movements in my university, and I try to make my passing through this world the most transforming and engaging possible.
Advisors
Alan Bush - M.Sc. in Biology
I'm M. Sc. in Biology and I'm currently doing my Ph. D. in Biology. My studies are in the field of ""systems biology"", an area which attempts to give a more quantitative and integrative approach to molecular biology, through the use of mathematic modeling tools. It is related to synthetic biology since it uses the same kind of tools and model organisms. However, the focus is radically different; while systems biology aims to understand how the cells work,  the main objective of synthetic biology is to design and produce ""biological devices"" with a given behavior. My main motivation for participating as advisor for UBA's iGEM team is precisely this approach switch. I'm fascinated with the idea of using our knowledge to develop useful devices which can help to solve concrete problems.
German Sabio - M.Sc. in Biology
I'm an extremely curious person, and I've always had a passion for all kind of ""bugs"" (a highly academic and very complex concept, which includes everything from cell and virus to mammal and aliens) and how ""life"" works. A M. Sc. in Biology didn't gave me the answer just yet, but kept my curiosity appeased for some years and gave me a big ammount of tools to keep asking new questions.
Currently, I work on a branch of biology dedicated to living being's development: how, from a single cell, or from a group of similar cells, a differentiated organism gets developed. My Ph. D. discipline is systems biology, which basically studies several biology areas looking for math patterns and predicting (or, actually, modelling) different living systems. Synthetic biology would be the other face of the same coin: while systems biology tries to find and define mechanisms in nature to understand how they work, synthetic biology tries to reproduce or generate new systems with a predetermined function. I'm very interested in this chance to take part on an iGEM team, not just for the ammount of tools it represents, but because it's a good and interesting experience to start a group and discuss and work together.
Instructors
Ignacio E. Sánchez - M.Sc. in Chemistry and Ph.D. in Biophysics
I'm a spanish bioinformatics specialist, currently living in Argentina. Before, I was an in training biophysicist on northern Europe, and before, a chemist, fascinated by biological molecules. Day by day, I study oncogenic virus in the Department of Biological Chemistry's Protein's Physiology Laboratory.
I think synthetic biology is an excellent chance for developing countries to acquire new capabilities in the subject of biotechnology. Because of that reason, I joined Dr. Nadra in 2011 to promote the formation of synthetic biologists in Argentina. By now, the experience is being highly fun and rewarding.
Alejandro D. Nadra - M.Sc. in Biology and Ph.D. in Chemistry
I'm M. Sc. in Biology (2001) and Ph. D. in Chemistry (2005). My subjects of interest are protein's structure/function/folding and their interaction with nucleic acids. Also hemoproteins, evolution and synthetic biology, and others. I did a post-doc with the molecular modelling group in the FCEyN and another one in the systems biology program of the Genomic Regulation Center from Barcelona.
I started to work as teacher in the FCEyN in 2000 and I'm currently Assistant Professor in the Department of Biological Chemistry and researcher at CONICET. I'm also a member of the Structural Biochemistry Laboratory, Department of Biological Chemistry. Given the lack of Synthetic Biology in Argentina, we are promoting the area with Ignacio Sánchez since 2011. For this effort, we organized the first post-graduate course in the subject in 2011, and conducted a course with featured international referents in April 2012. I'm convinced that from my place and given my formation, I can boost Synthetic Biology and begin formation of pure strain Synthetic Biologists. I believe the iGEM competitions are an excellente tool for the education and motivation of students. I'm convinced that from Argentina we can contribute to the subject and be on pair with teams from everywhere in the world. Even though we count on less resources and funds, this lack is compensated with a huge motivation and creativity.

5Tucker Lab of UC Denver
Param Sidhu
Param was one of the main driving forces behind lab work. He spent large amounts of time planning the daily schedule, figuring out which restriction digests should be completed, mini-prepping DNA, and cloning plasmids. He also learned to operate the flow cytometer and analyze flow cytometric data. He continued working on the project after the summer ended and the school year began.
Morgan Howell
Morgan was the other main driving force behind lab work. His duties included maintaining the lab notebook, helped to design the wiki, growing yeast, growing bacteria, transforming yeast and bacteria, running gels, and programming the FCAnalyze program which significantly expedited the analysis of flow cytometric data. He continued working on the project after the summer ended and the school year began.
Peter Fan
Peter helped to develop the compuational Tinker Cell Model of the Optogenetic system and also contributed to the lab work through running gels and digests, preparing yeast for flow cytometry, and transforming bacteria. He also participated in more menial tasks such as labeling tubes and making aliquots. Peter also helped implement many of the human practice approaches and worked to maintain the wiki. Regretfully, Peter was unable to continue coming to lab after the school year began but continued helping the team through devising the wiki, human practice approaches, and working on the tinker cell model.
Mentors and Lab
The team is indebted to Buchler Lab and Gersbach Lab for their mentorship. The Principal Investigators and Lab Members served largely as mentors and supervisors. Lab Members trained the team members in a variety of lab techniques and helped provide pointers and tips on ways to enhance DNA yields and document their work to prevent errors.
Tucker Lab of UC Denver
Our work built off of existing work by Chandra Tucker and her lab at UC Denver. The Tucker Lab designed and built the two-hybrid proteins and plasmids that we used in our work.  See the following methods paper for more information about construction and use of these constructs in yeast:

1.We would like to thank iGEM Colombia Team 2011*. Their original idea of sensing a fungal plant pathogen through a system of two transgenic bacterial variants is extended our the actual project, facilitating and improving key aspects of part design and modeling. Their experience contributed not only with concepts and strategies, but also by aiding to prevent and/or address several issues and pitfalls we have come across in the development of our work. We want to briefly mention some aspects that makes our project different from the 2011's. The idea to use genetically modified bacteria to detect pathogen molecules in an early stage of pathogen invasion is maintained this year, however, no parts from the previous project were used in this year project. iGEM Colombia team 2011 aimed to detect coffee rust fungus Hemileia vastatrix only. This year's team extends the idea of pathogen detection to detect also a bacterial pathogen, Ralstonia solanacearum, which is a vascular pathogen of tomato Solanum lycopersicum and potato Solanum tuberosum, as well as other crop plants. Another key feature introduced this year is the toxin-antitoxin modules which will be used to control the bacterial population density, prevent horizontal gene transfer and plasmid curing (in an antibiotic free strategy).
The full list of team members can be found at https://2011.igem.org/Team:Colombia/Team .

STUDENTS
Dorota Kaja Sabat
I am studying biology and psychology at the College of Interfaculty Individual Studies in Mathematics and Natural Sciences . So far I was researching mutations in POLG1 human gene, but this year I am beginning my adventure with embryology. Aside from science, I like traveling and taking photographs. I am also enthusiastic rock climber :)
Krzysztof Szczepaniak
I'm finishing my studies at the College of Interfaculty Individual Studies in Mathematics and Natural Sciences but I'm going to stay in Science business;) Beside biology, I like computer programming and I try to develop my skills in this field. Outside the lab I am a scout leader, I'm interested in foreign languages, astronomy and I love everything connected with science-fiction and fantasy.
Magda Ghanim
I'm studying biotechnology and chemistry at the College of Interfaculty Individual Studies in Mathematics and Natural Sciences at the University of Warsaw. My main areas of scientific interest are Genetics, Molecular Biology, and Analytic Chemistry. My B. Sc. thesis will investigate mutations of mitochondrial DNA after chemotherapy in leukemia patients. Aside from science, I love classical literature, ancient history, traveling, animals (I have two cute kitties and a guinea pig) and mountain hiking.
Monika Szewczyk
I come from Przychojec, the most beautiful  village in south-east Poland. I am a student of chemistry and biotechnology at the College of Interfaculty Individual Studies in Mathematics and Natural Sciences, University of Warsaw. My scientific interests include biophysical chemistry and molecular biology. I love traveling, meeting new people and cycling.
Elżbieta Jankowska
I'm a fifth year student of Biotechnology, which means I'm going to spend next year working on my Masters thesis. My area of scientific interest includes ancient DNA, molecular phylogenetics, synthetic biology (of course:p) and anything I find interesting at the moment. Apart from that I like travelling, singing and sci-fi & fantasy.
Weronika Krzynowek
Weronika Krzynowek is twenty-one years old
She's polite and always does as she's told
For a girl her age, she's considerate and nice
But she wants to be just like she's throwing the dice
She doesn't mind living with her sister, dog, and cats
Though she'd rather share a home with spiders and bats
There she could reflect on the horrors she has invented
and wander dark hallways alone and tormented
But imagines dipping her in wax for his wax museum
He likes to experiment on her dog Abocrombie
In the hopes of creating a horrible zombie
So that he and her horrible zombie dog
could go searching for victims in the London fog
Her thoughts aren't only of ghoulish crime
He likes to paint and read to pass some of the time
While other kids read books like ""Go Jane Go""
Weronika's favorite author is Edgar Allen Poe.
Anna Misiukiewicz
I’m a last year student of biotechnology at the University of Warsaw. My Bachelor thesis was done at the Department of Applied Microbiology, so does Master. Usually, my lab partner is Yersinia enterocolitica but this summer I decided to make an exception and befriend Bacillus subtilis. I can’t imagine my life without a cup of black tea, weather forecast and visiting my hometown – Białystok. I dream of spending my holiday walking and taking some pictures with my old Zenit camera, but this year my fondness of bacteria turns out to be stronger ;)
Nikodem Latocha
Hi, my name is Nikodem. I do my research in the Department of Immunology at the Medical University of Warsaw. I`m interested in sports, computers and science of course ;) I think iGEM is a great opportunity to learn about synthetic biology and take part in a relatively young area of science.
INSTRUCTORS
prof. dr hab. Jacek Bielecki
Education: MSc, University of Warsaw, 1975 ;PhD, University of Warsaw, 1981 ;Associated professor, Warsaw University, 1995; Professor at University of Warsaw, 1996 ;Vice Dean of Faculty of Biology, 1996 - 1999, and 1999-2002
Research interests: Molecular mechanisms of virulence of bacteria Listeria monocytogenes, especially the role of a hemolysin, listeriolysin O (LLO).
dr. Radosław Stachowiak
My adventure with biology and biotechnology dates back to 1995 when I became a biotechnology student at the University of Warsaw. In the year 2000 I completed my MSc thesis and I guess I couldn’t stop there so I immidiately started PhD studies. Now I’m done with studying and my job is to take care of students and introduce them into science. Still, I like being involved in crazy projects so characteristic of Sudents’ Societies. The more crazy and incredible project the better. I guess this is the case so here I am.
dr. Takao Ishikawa
Born in Tokyo, working and living in Warsaw, I am interested in protein-protein interactions. In my research, I employ in silico modeling of protein complexes and theirs verification by molecular biology methods. I am not only fascinated by life science, but also being in love with popularization of science. Giving lectures for students, teachers, and children give me a lot of fun!

Attribution
We had an ambitious project and very little time; therefore, we adopted a shift based work system in the wet lab. Some team members used to come early in the morning and after dinner their experiments were passed to others, who like working late.
Bacillus subtilis construct
The parts for Bacillus subtilis were designed by Elżbieta Jankowska, Krzysztof Szczepaniak, and Nikodem Latocha. The whole team helped in the lab work, which was mainly supervised by Ania Misiukiewicz, our chief microbiologist, whose skills and patience were crucial in this part of the project.
Mammalian construct
The work was designed and performed mainly by Kaja Sabat. The whole team helped wherever they could.
Shuttle vector
The work was mainly designed by Kaja. The whole team helped wherever they could.
Human practice
Kaja, Krzysztof and Elżbieta went to the conference 'Numbers, Computers, Life', where Ela and Krzysztof gave a presentation, and all three of them presented a poster about last year's iGEM project. There they met Weronika Krzynowek, who joined our team in the summer.
The whole team ran the stand on the Biologists' Night at the Faculty of Biology, University of Warsaw.
Dr. Radosław Stachowiak, our instructor, performed a presentation on the 2nd International Scientific Seminar ""Science-Society-Didactics"" on synthetic biology.
Wiki
The website was coded by Weronika, our codemaster. The graphics and pictures were made by Elżbieta, our homemade artist. Kaja wrote the ""steps"" part. The whole team contributed to our wiki, which was corrected and edited by Magda Ghanim, the grammar nazi.
Fundrising
Monika Szewczyk did a great job acquiring sponsors and rising funds. During the summer, Magda contributed to the organization of funds and invoices. Krzysztof helped in acquiring all the stamps we needed.

Full name: Choi Yiu Ting Angus
Nickname: Angus
Programme of Study: BSc Biochemistry
Contributions:  Team leader, Lab work, Fundraising, Human Practice
 
Hello everyone, I’m Angus Choi, a second year student studying Biochemistry.  I love to sing (and I do sing a lot), play soccer and do street photography, though they have nothing to do with research directly, but they are my good ways to spend on when I have free time.
Its my honor to be the team leader of the CUHK iGEM team this year.  To me, iGEM offers a great opportunity to me for learning different things like seeking sponsorships, learning lab skills and cooperating with people. I hope that our team can come up with great success this year.  Good luck!

Contributions: Biobricks design, Molecular Cloning, Human Practices, Biobricks Characterization
 
Hey, this  is Ricky =]  I am a year two undergraduate student studying in CUHK. Having fun is my hobby,  I am so glad to be in IGEM that offers me so much fun, oportunities and experiences. The best part of IGEM is that  we, undergraduate students are able to make our own decisions to develop the whole project and share it with teams from around the world.
 
Full name: Feng Kaiyin
Nickname: Karin
Programme of study: Biomedical Engineering
Contributions: Molecular cloning, logbook input
 
Hi, I’m Karin, a year 2 student in CUHK, and I come from Nanjing in mainland China. It may be strange that as I am from Engineering Faculty, I enjoy all the wet lab work in iGEM, and love the experience of learning new knowledge of Synthetic Biology, which I had totally no idea before. I will never forget the crazy feeling of stepping out of lab at midnight, looking up at the stars and hoping they were clones in the agar plate… Joining igem is a great process of enjoying consistent failure and learning how to stick to the will. I really treasure this summer with all the unexpected encounters in igem, the failures give me strength, and the gains make me grateful.
 
Full name: Nim Yap Shing
Nickname: Asa
Programme of Study: Biochemistry
Contributions: Biobrick design, Molecular Cloning, Biobrick Characterization, Poster content
 
iGEM is the most large-scale and best competition that I have ever participated in. It gives me much freedom to do research-like study in undergraduate level and a chance to glimpse into scientific research.  I am glad that I have tried many wet-lab technique as well as other useful skills even though I was quite frustrated when I have no idea of what to do next, and bored when I repeat the same procedures again and again. I am so regretful that I did not pay attention to the lectures in the past year and I have to revise the notes before starting my project!
 
Full Name: Vallery Mortel Fabilla
Nickname: Val
Programme of Study: Biochemistry
Contributions: Secretary, Human Practices, Supportive Lab Work
 
Hi, I'm Vallery, a Filipino native raised in Hong Kong with an affinity for science and hands-on laboratory work. I am an avid reader, guitarist and squash player during my leisure time. A passionate and willing team player who contributes her efforts to the best of her capabilities.Through iGEM I have explored and experienced my field of study outside of textbooks and realized the potential benefits of Synthetic Biology. It has been an honour to join this year's iGEM Competition. With it brought challenges, knowledge and friendship.

Hello. I’m Jennifer, studying Biochemistry. Love life! Love thinking! The process of analysing and figuring out the mechanism of different biological processes are fanscinating to me. What's more is that we can make use of our own knowledge to make some difference of our world. That comes to the reason for me to love science join the iGEM. I enjoy the time spending in the lab in this summer with all my teammates. That's unique and unforgettable. Last but not the least, all the best for our team and I look forward meeting every one of you, who share same interest with us, in the coming Jamboree.
 
Full name: Ho Ka Him
Nickname: Ken
Programme of study: Medicine
Contributions: supportive lab work
 
Hi there! I will be a year one student of Medicine of CUHK. For me, IGEM is not just a competition, it is a valuable chance to train up one's perservence and to meet other undergraduates of various backgrounds to strive for the same goal. To use one word to describe IGEM, probably it would be ""supercalifragilisticexpialidocious"".
 
Full name: Jian Guang Hao
Nickname: Leonardo
Programme of study: Biochemistry
Contributions: Focus on Lab Work, Human Practice
 
I am a year 2 Franklinstein who loves problem solving and exciting stuffs. Other than boring lab work, I love travelling and all-kinds of sports too. The greatest experience in iGEM is to experience the life of being a scientist, which is consistent failure. Though we considered closing files a dozen times, there are always small hopes to urge us to continue. And then, we fail again. This looped process surprisingly made me to grow to a more responsible and mature person who can resist failure. On the other hand, iGEM is a great place to work with other Franklinsteins for half a year and we indeed made some fire.

Programme of Study: Food and Nutritional Science

Hello, my name is Pearl, and I am from Taiwan. I am a full-time student majoring in Food and Nutritional Science at CUHK. After staying in the lab for most of this summer, I am sure that iGEM definitely help me to master some laboratory skills. And personally, it gave me the chance to stay abroad for the entire summer when I have sufficient time to travel Hong Kong and know about its culture. Also because of iGEM, I am able to make some local friends and earn the experience of working with people of different backgrounds. Thinking of how iGEM has fully occupied my summer and turned it unconventional, I am glad to be part of this competition.

We are proud to say that all of the ideas we worked on this summer were proposed by undergraduate members of our own team. We also want to thank all those advisors and instructors who helped us discuss these ideas and guided us through doing the experiments. The whole experimental data produced by the Tokyo Tech 2012 team comes from experiments carried out all by undergraduates.
The idea of ""Romeo and juliet"",the idea of ""Cell-cell communication""(Takuo Sugiyama)and the idea of ""PHA production""(Taku Nakayama) were all proposed by undergraduate members of our team. Modeling related to ""Romeo and Juliet"" was also done by undergraduate students (Nobuaki Yasuo).
Contribution
We thank J. Collins for providing JM2.300.
We thank Prof. Ohta H for using fluorescence microscope.
We thank iGEM HokkaidoU Japan 2012 for exchanging opinions about P(3HB) Production.
We thank Prof. Konagaya A and Yoshida K for advising about Modeling.

Shui Jing
I’m Shui Jing, a sophomore and still don’t have major. All the wonders in physics and biology attract me so much that I really enjoy the process of learning.
In my spare time, I am involved in all kinds of sports, such as basketball, badminton, table tennis swimming and many more.  As a team leader, my major task in this project is arranging the team affairs, I am also responsible for our wiki. I think I have learned a lot from this special experience. learning how to cooperate with team members from different background and different characters and how to shoulder the responsibilities I have to face are not as easy as what you say. The more difficulties I overcome, the more mature I will be.
I hope everyone can have fun in IGEM and enjoy the process.

ZiShan Wu
I’m Zishan Wu. My friends call me big potato because I am like the cartoon character in ‘Old Master’. I always think I am lucky because I met many wonderful things. So, joining in iGEM team is my luckiness ,too.Our team divide into lab group and theory group. I chose the theory group because I liked writing programs and reading some intersting papers. I really enjoyed the process where I learned many things and got closer to our goal step by step.

Contribution to our team: Be a member of experiment group and design the T-shirt on the  leisure time.
Statement : Beginning with no professional knowledge and skills, I am eager to learn everything. The process of the whole experiment is a procedure of learning and summarizing. There is no time to delay. Learn from mistakes. Be responsible for your data and results.  Motto: Young and challenge yourself. Nothing is impossible.
Yao Chen
I am Chen Yao. I like writing and reading, and I love science. I like both failure and success. Failure makes me mature, and success after many times of failure makes failure meaningful. I attended iGEM because I really enjoyed doing something special. In our team, I am one of the ""programmers"" and I wrote the program hairpinscore in C#.
BoYu Qie
You can call me Qie Boyu, which is my name, or Qie Ye, which means grandfather Qie made by my friends to show their honour(ahahaha~). I'm from Chengdu, the best city in the world. In order to find some meaningful project to do in the summer vacation, I take part in our iGEM team though I nearly didn't known everything out of biology tought in high school. Doing the project with my friends is very cool, I totally fall in love with the process of it. I'm loving it !
Xianggeng Liu
I am Xianggeng Liu, a undergraduates from SUSTC, and will major in chemistry. I am responsible for  database, lab and wiki. My hobbies are chemistry, history and football. iGEM gives me a chance to understand synthetic biology and do some research, which makes me enjoy science.
Liuxing Shen
Hi, I'm liuxingshen and a member of terminator team. Instead of wetlab, I focused on lecture and computer stuffs. This was my first time to involve in a big team projects and I found so much things new and fascinating. During this summer ,I have learned how to trust teammates and how to distribute the tasks to them. Sometimes, I was tired and desperate but, after all, it was a thrill to experience something like this!

My name is Patrick Bateman. I am twenty-six years old. I live in the American Garden Buildings on West Eighty-First Street, on the eleventh floor.I believe in taking care of myself, in a balanced diet, in a rigorous exercise routine. In the morning, if my face is a little puffy, I'll put on an ice pack while doing my stomach crunches. I can do a thousand now. After I remove the icepack, I use a deep pore-cleanser lotion. In the shower, I use a water-activated gel cleanser, then a honey-almond body scrub, and on the face an exfoliating gel scrub.Then I apply an herb mint facial masque which I leave on for ten minutes while I prepare the rest of my routine. I always use an after-shave lotion with little or no alcohol because alcohol dries your face out and makes you look older. Then moisturizer, then an anti-aging eye balm, followed by a final moisturizing ""protective"" lotion...There is an idea of a Patrick Bateman, some kind of abstraction, hut there is no real me, only an  entity, something illusory, and though I can hide my cold gaze and you can shake my hand and feel flesh gripping you  and maybe you can even sense our lifestyles are probably comparable: I simply am not there.

Human Practice
■Science Agora 2011
Science Agora , held at Tokyo Academic Park in November every year, is the largest science communication event in Japan. Participants are kids and parents, students, companies, researchers and so on. We took part in it with two other Japanese teams last year after the end of 2011 iGEM competition. In this big meeting, we exhibited posters that we used in World Jamboree and gave an account of iGEM and our project to not only specialists but also the public by using new posters. This was also good chance to explain synthetic biology to the public.
■Lecture at secondary school
On July 11, 2012, our team made a lecture at the career guidance to the 9th graders of Minamitama Metropolitan Secondary School. We described our project and activities of iGEM in the lecture and caught many interests about synthetic biology and iGEM from the future researchers.
In the one-hour lecture, we talked broadly about of our campus life and then focused on iGEM as an activity example. However, the students had no basic knowledge of synthetic biology. Therefore, began with catchy topics, used easy words besides technical terms and used more figures and illustrations besides long explanations to make the whole lecture more understandable. The reactions of the students were good. They paid good attention to our lecture and some were taking notes. The fact that iGEM is an international competition seemed to attracted their ambition.
Through this short time, we believe that we were able to make notice the 9th graders that there is a science field called “synthetic biology” and that there is an international competition for synthetic biology students. We gained many attention and interests of the becoming scientists to this field and iGEM.
■High school and university collaboration
In Tokyo Metropolitan University, collaboration activity with high school is frequently planned as a university's project. On July 11, 2012, the same day to a lecture in Minamitama Metropolitan Secondary School, it was held. We explained our project and activities of iGEM and caught many interests about synthetic biology.
Other Participation
■Alumni Association of Tokyo Metropolitan University We told about iGEM to alumni and alumnae of TMU (Tokyo Metropolitan University)  Many people from not only the Biology Department but also other Departments were interested in our activity.
■iGEM Japan Meet up
On 13 Aug, iGEM teams in Japan assembled and exchanged information. Participated teams are:
Kyoto
TMU-Tokyo
Tokyo_Tech
UT-Tokyo
UT-Tokyo-Software
A flurry of many pointed questions were realized.
TMU-Tokyo served as the host team, so meet up was held in Tokyo Metropolitan University.
Next Japan meet up is 28 Sep. We are planning to rehearsal of Asia Jamboree.

About the Team
This year our iGEM team consists of four undergraduate students and five high school students. We are being advised by one professor, a research associate, and a PhD student.
Undergraduate Students
Thomas Patrick
Hi. My name is Tom Patrick, and I am on the University of Alberta iGEM team this year. I just finished my first year studying engineering, and I am going to specialize in environmental engineering. Synthetic biology is a field I find very interesting, and I am excited to be participating in this competition. I have no previous experience working with any of the biological sciences, and this experience has been a great introduction to this incredible field. My hobbies include skiing, listening to music, watching movies, and playing cards.
Easwar Vasi
I am entering my third year of Immunology and Infection in the department of IMIN at the University of Alberta. Although, I have previous experience in labs (research and course), iGEM is going to be a new and exciting experience for me. As this is my first year in iGEM, I hope to apply the skills I learned from hands-on experience in labs and the knowledge gained in lectures. What truly makes me excited about iGEM is the independence and cooperation. The goal of the project, the methods undertaken to accomplish it, and the success and inevitable failures of the experiments rests entirely upon us (the team). I hope to increase the rate of success by working hard in the lab. Outside of the lab, I like to read science fiction books, play video games, and attempt to live a healthy lifestyle by playing badminton.
Nien-Tsu (Rick) Tseng
I graduated in the summer of 2012 from the Biological Science program at the U of A. I am very proud to have had the opportunity to participate in the iGEM project. This project not only provided me with the laboratory work experience, it also fueled my interest to go into the research field. iGEM provided me the chances to share some different views about the future with other participants. The goal of the project was to provide me and other participants with techniques and way of thinking to successfully solve synthetic biology problems. Furthermore, the greatest teammates, TA, and professors in this iGEM team are like a microcosm world that gave me memories that I will never forget in life. I am looking forward to having lots of fun and excitement with my teammates in the future iGEM competition.
Spencer Short
My name is Spencer Short. I am currently a third year genetics student studying at the University of Alberta. As a Genetics student, I was fascinated by the possibilities of synthetic biology, and quickly joined IGEM after my friend informed me of the competition. IGEM has opened my eyes to the inherent joys and frustrations of lab work and given me a greater respect for research scientists as a whole.  The communal aspect of IGEM also appeals to me; sometimes we forget that science is living, breathing, mutualistic organism. When you meet like-minded people from across the globe just like you, in pursuit of a greater goal it really affects you: you become aware of something bigger than yourself.  Science, and life for that matter, is about coming together with people and bettering society. Although it would be nice to win a gold medal this year, I’m just happy to be at the start of such an exciting, beautiful stream of science. When I’m not at the lab, I enjoy reading, meditating, running, working out, socializing, snowboarding, and playing soccer and softball.

High School Students
Sarah Haeubl
I am a high school student going into my grade 12 year at Strathcona High, where I am taking all three major sciences. My interests lie in many other areas, including music, theatre, and history, but biology stands out in particular. Coming from an academic family, I’ve always been intrigued by research and science, and I am thrilled to be participating in the iGEM competition where I have the opportunity to experience both of these things. I hope that I can get a clearer idea of what science at the university level is like over the course of the summer, and see some of the different post-secondary paths that appeal to my interests.
Torrin Lemire
My name is Torrin Lemire, and I recently finished high school at Archbishop MacDonald in Edmonton. Next year, I will be attending the University of Alberta in the engineering program. I have some lab experience, having previously worked in an engineering lab developing and testing dry adhesives. As this is my first year participating in the iGEM program, I am looking forward to learning about synthetic biology and developing new lab skills. In my spare time, I enjoy playing competitive soccer, reading, and biking in the river valley.
Peter West
I have had an interest in science for most of my academic career, with taking all three major sciences in high school, and competing in the Edmonton Science Olympics competition being among my scientific activities. However, I also enjoy art, having taken part in my school’s musical as well as its jazz and men’s choir. I spent last summer working in a machine shop, and I am excited for the new challenge of taking part in the iGEM competition. I am especially interested in getting the best results I can get, and making positive contributions to science in general.
Abdullah Farooq
I am going into grade 11 next year. I have always been interested in the natural world around me, and this interest has cultivated into a keen interest in synthetic biology. I have participated in science fairs and competitions related to science. I have always loved experimenting in the kitchen, much to the pain of my family and parents. I previously worked on a carbon monoxide biosensor. I really appreciate the opportunity to do work in a laboratory on an iGEM team. In addition to my academics, I enjoy parkour and freerunning, tae kwon do, and growing yogurt.
Aidan Burke
I have a very small background in science, but participating in the IGEM competition has sparked a new interest and hobby. I have a large background in theatre and have been fortunate enough to be cast in plays with the Edmonton Citadel Theatre, and the Edmonton Fringe Festival. I enjoyed being involved with my high school’s musical this year, and participating in my high school’s men’s choir and jazz choir. A huge thanks to Dr. Ellison for making me a part of an awesome team.

PhD Student Supervisor
Ryan Mercer
I am a PhD candidate from the Department of Biology at Memorial University in St. John’s, Newfoundland. I have recently relocated to Edmonton where I am finishing writing my PhD thesis and assisting with supervising the University of Alberta 2012 iGEM team part time. I have a strong background in molecular microbiology and hope to share my knowledge and experience with this year’s team as they use recombinant DNA cloning to complete their project. Outside the lab, I have interests in general science, fitness and sports.

Namespace Rules
The 2012 iGEM wiki is shared by all the teams. The way they manage this chaos is by assigning every team a namespace. Accordingly, the rules say we should start all of our pages with Team:British_Columbia. So do it! Again:
Name your pages ""Team:British_Columbia/yourpagename""
Templates
The group of links at the top of the page is a template. Templates are blocks of wiki that you can easily embed in other pages. You include a template in a page by entering the template name enclosed in curly brackets. For example, the header we put at the top of every page is embedded by entering:
{{Template:Team:British_Columbia_Header}}
You can edit the a template by going to its wiki page and clicking the edit link at the top. Here's a link to the navigation header template: Template:Team:British_Columbia_Header . If a page contains templates, you'll see them mentioned at the bottom of the edit page.
Page Headings
You can give your page heirarhcical headings by enclosing the headings in == The page's title is the primary heading
Secondary Headings
are generated by ==Secondary Headings==.
Tertiary Headings
are generated by ===Tertiary Headings===, and so on.

Collaboration with University of Calgary iGEM
We thank Dr. Lisa Gieg and University of Calgary iGEM for collaborating and splitting the DSZ pathway for characterization: We wanted to collaborate with Calgary because of the friendship and hospitality they showed last year! Considering that we were both working with the same operon, we decided that Calgary would take DszA and DszB while we would take DszC and DszD. We also set up meetings to see what else we could do in collaboration. We initially wanted to see if we could do anything regarding modeling together, given that we were working with similar systems. However, Calgary was more interested in bioremediation, rather than fuel processing. We then struck on the idea of collaborating on kill switches. Calgary wanted to characterize a few new induction systems, including a rhamnose promoter and two new riboswitches for their kill switches. They have yet to have success with their rhamnose promoter. They sent us the sequence before they attempted anything with it, and we used that sequence to design primers to get the rhamnose promoter out of the genome. Noticing the paucity of standardization of kill switches on the registry, we took it upon ourselves to develop a plan to test the efficacy of any new toxic protein that might be wanted to be tested for kill switch capabilities. There was a fair amount of talk about how best to do a death assay. We suggested using Dendra2, a fluorescent protein that could be 'broken' at a specific non-cytotoxic wavelength of light, allowing us to quantify metabolic activity after supposed death after toxic protein induction by looking for further expression of the fluorescent protein. They argued that a dormant cell may not express this protein, and we wouldn't really be looking at death. We then decided that we ought to instead focus on plating assays, for this better tests the viability of cells. We both tried testing existing kill switches on the registry, but were unable to get any of them to work. Calgary postulated that this was due to the arabinose promoter, which they could never get it to work. In the mean time, we both sequenced some of the toxic genes used as kill switches in the registry, and found that everything we sequenced was indeed what it claimed to be. Calgary also sent us the gene for HPAC, an alternative NADH-FMN oxidoreductase, to be used in place of DszD. It is a native E coli enzyme, and apparently works better, though over-expression causes hydrogen peroxide formation. We had plans to see if we could get it expressed in a pET vector to look for peroxide generation, but we have not done this yet. Lastly, they sent us the yddg- strain from David's old lab at U of A, which could be used in complementation studies. Kerner et al. (2012) used the yddg part because it increases the rate of export of tyrosine by 3 times, and increases overall tyrosine production. We have created a constitutively expressed yddg part that we would ultimately like use to check for complementation (yddg also confers resistance to inhibiting concentrations of aromatic amino acids), but we have not made competent cells from this strain.
Collaboration with INSA-Lyon
To help team INSA-Lyon with their human practice project investigating the how intellectual property affects iGEM, we have provided them with the data from our survey results .  In return, INSA-Lyon assisted us by giving us feedback on drafts of our iGEM-specific intellectual property guide .

British Columbia - 2012.igem.org
The UBC iGEM Team We are a team of 9 undergraduate team members, 4 graduate student advisors and 2 faculty advisors. Our team is hosted by the Steven Hallam laboratory in the Department of Microbiology & Immunology at the University of British Columbia (UBC). We have 2 undergraduate team members from the Faculty of Applied Sciences and 7 undergraduate team members from the Faculty of Science.
Undergraduate Team Members
Cameron Strachan I recently finished my undergraduate degree in Honours Microbiology and I am currently doing research in the Hallam lab at UBC. I have interests in metabolic engineering and environmental genomics, and my role in iGEM was designing and carrying out experiments to create a tunable synthetic consortium. I was also involved in modeling distributed metabolism in the environment.
Grace Yi I am currently a second-year Pharmacology student interested in gaining insight into research in general. My interests include baking cookies (and eating them), singing along to the radio, and admiring luxury vehicles. Synthetic biology offers an opportunity to creatively solve complex issues, and iGEM is entirely unique in that it fosters interdisciplinary collaboration between students and faculty, and between top-notch schools. This chance to work with people of diverse backgrounds and participate in research in this novel field made iGEM a priority for me. I have contributed to the wet lab portion of our project, more specifically to creating new biobricks via standard assembly. I am working on the site-directed mutagenesis of the DszC gene to remove the two illegal PstI sites before submission to the Registry.
Jacob Toth To-morrow, and to-morrow, and to-morrow, Creeps in this petty pace from day to day To the last syllable of recorded time, And all our yesterdays have lighted fools The way to dusty death. Out, out, brief candle! Life's but a walking shadow, a poor player That struts and frets his hour upon the stage And then is heard no more: it is a tale Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, Signifying nothing. Jacob Toth is a third year honours biochemistry student at the University of British Columbia. This is his second year in iGEM, and this year he has been focusing on generating and testing constructs, modeling (particularly the wet-lab side of things), trying to navigate the registry, and has found himself working with a kill switch project on the side. His other interests include philosophy, botany, and music. He also enjoys Shakespearean prose and reciting it in his sleep.
Joe Ho Joe Ho is a fifth year Integrated Sciences student at UBC and a returning member from last year's iGEM team. This year, Joe is focused on generating biobrick constructs for engineering a microbial consortium which is capable of distributed metabolism. With this consortium, he will be  monitoring its population dynamics through the use of standardized fluorescence proteins as well as assaying for its ability to cooperatively desulfurize organosulfur compounds, such as dibenzothiophene. Joe hopes that his experience with iGEM will allow him to excel in the field of synthetic biology in the future.
John Deppe John is in his 3rd year in Chemical Engineering at UBC. Prior to UBC, he earned an Associates degree at Everett Community College and served in the US Navy. A board game enthusiast, John was a semifinalist in the North American division of the World Catan Championship this year.
Marianne Park I am currently a second year medical student at UBC and this is my third year with the UBC iGEM team. This year, my contribution to the team focused on mentorship as well as wet lab work (once again) involving biobrick building.
Mehul Sharma Senor Sharma came to Canada with a simple dream--to make it in the modelling industry. This competition is his big break, and he plans to wow the world at the iGEM jamboree this autumn. Prepare to be amazed. In his spare time Mehul is also doing a major in microbiology and immunology and is helping with the wet lab part for the UBC iGEM team. His contributions to iGEM includes the construction of the tunable consortia consisting of amino acid auxotrophs, transformed with complementing amino acid genes. He enjoys recreational activities, Lord of the Rings and loves the thrill of re-registering for his drivers exam every time he fails. Also, he hates talking about himself in the third person.
Rui Chen Xue I majored in Chemical and Biological Engineering. For this iGEM project, my focuses are Modelling and Modelling related wet lab activities. I also contributed to the Industrial Insight  section in Human Practice. Personally I am very interested in Clean Energy and Pharmaceutical Process, especially Bioenergy field. These are the areas that I want to devote my career in. Being a member of UBC 2012 team, I received tons of knowledge about bacterial engineering, and really enjoyed working with people of diverse backgrounds. Constant interdisciplinary collaboration and creative problem solving skill requirements made iGEM a valuable experience for everyone. I am really appreciative to this opportunity. For more information about me, please go to my personal profile.
Ting Chia Wong Majoring in Integrated Sciences, I am currently a third-year student.  My integration is between synthetic biology and human biology, so joining the UBC team happened naturally.  In fact, my choice of specialization can be attributed to iGEM.  As a competition that emphasizes innovation and exploration, iGEM was really what pulled me towards this area of research.  This fascination with synthetic biology stems from both the exciting possibilities it offers and the creativity it demands.  My contribution to this year's project include wet lab and human practice work.
Graduate Student Advisors
James Round I'm currently a PhD student in Microbiology and Immunology at the University of British Columbia. In the Eltis Lab, I focus on the use of bacteria biocatalysts to transform lignin, part of lignocellulosic biomass, into high-value aromatic compounds and feedstock material for lignin-based resins and carbon fibres. My scientific interests are metabolic engineering, biocatalyst development, and biotechnology.
Michael VanInsberghe I'm a PhD student in the Genome Science and Technology graduate program at the University of British Columbia. I'm working in the Hansen group to develop methods in single-cell genomics by exploiting recent advances in microfluidics. When not stuck in a cleanroom, I can usually be found out in the mountains surrounding the Lower Mainland.
Alina Chan I am a 4th year PhD student in Phil Hieter's yeast genetics lab at UBC. My own research project looks at RNA:DNA hybrids and their effect on genome stability. I have been advising iGEM teams since 2010, helping with project brainstorming and planning, wet-lab resourcing and troubleshooting, bridging wet-lab and computational modeling, as well as various human practices and outreach endeavours. It's been really amazing advising the UBC iGEM team members as they design and dive into their projects with so much energy and effort and attend the iGEM competitions. The UBC iGEM teams since 2010 have been working on many exciting research areas ranging from biofilm degradation to terpene production to microbial consortia. Being on the team has been very eye-opening for me and I hope to pursue postdoctoral research in bioengineering fields.
Rafael Saer I'm one of the graduate advisors for the 2012 UBC iGEM team. My focus in the team is to provide wet lab assistance and troubleshooting to the members, as well as supply the odd reagent that my lab always tends to have.  When I'm not helping out the iGEM team, I'm conducting research in bacterial photosynthesis. Specifically, I investigate structure and function relationships in bacterial reaction center proteins from ''Rhodobacter sphaeroides'' using a mutagenic approach. When I graduate, I hope to pursue careers in synthetic biology and photosynthesis. Please see my Openwetware profile for more information.

Currently, more than 30,500 students are enrolled in 14 faculties in undergraduate, graduate and professional degree programs. The University contains more than 30 research institutions and centres, including the O’Brien Centre within which iGEM Calgary operates. The university is also the birthplace of many inventions including the neurochip, and has had 140,000 alumni since its founding in 1966.
The O'Brien Centre for the Health Sciences
The O' Brien Centre for the Health Sciences is located in the Foothills campus of the University of Calgary. It has provided the iGEM team with lab space as well as funding. The O’Brien Centre was founded by David O’ Brien, who is a member of the Board of Directors at the U of C. The O’Brien Centre is the hub of top-notch interdisciplinary research and education. It funds approximately 9 million dollars a year for research.  The 2011 iGEM team thanks the O’Brien Centre for the O’Brien Centre Summer Studentships, awarded to three of our members, as well as lab space, materials, and equipment for this year.
About Calgary
Calgary is the largest city in Alberta, and has a population of over 1 million. It was founded in 1875, when the RCMP erected Fort Calgary (then Fort Brisebois) to protect the western plains from whiskey traders. When the Canadian Pacific Railway reached the area in 1883, Calgary grew into an important commercial and agricultural center. Currently, Calgary's economy is dominated by the oil and gas industry, and major attractions include Canada Olympic Park (the site of the 1988 Winter Olympics), Calaway Park, the Lilac Festival, and the Calgary Stampede (an annual agricultural fair founded in 1905). Calgary is also situated near the Rocky Mountains, and plays host to a unique weather phenomenom called the chinook. Famous Calgarians include the young, incumbent mayor, Naheed Nenshi, who is the first Muslim to become mayor of a major Canadian city, as well as the current Prime Minister of Canada, Conservative leader Stephen Harper.

James Thorogood
I am in my second year of Mechanical Engineering with a biomedical specialization. This summer I had a blast with iGEM Calgary, where I have been responsible for the development of the biosensor hardware and software package. This is my first time partaking in research, and I have learned volumes about biology, genetics, engineering and more. After my time at iGEM, I am beginning to consider an engineering career path in/around these fields. I also learned that biologists are people too. In my free time, I play various sports, hike and cliff-jump in Banff, browse GrooveShark, lose to Colin in foosball, jam, and spend time with friends. I also devote my time to the position of Sports Director with the Engineering Student’s Society, and the team-lead for a youth engagement group in Engineers Without Borders.
Nick Cassar
Hello, my name’s Nick, and this is my first year involved with iGEM. What a wonderful experience this has been, from building circuits to dabbling in programming to getting everything to work perfectly. I love coming to work every morning, and it’s always a pleasure to be with everyone here. In my spare time I enjoy playing guitar/piano or just hitting up the gym. Go Team!
Robert Mayall
I'm Robert, a fourth year student studying Biomedical Science at the University of Calgary. This is my second year in iGEM and I haven't been scared off yet. I like long walks on the beach and genetically modifying bacteria to do my bidding. My main focus in our iGEM project is FRED, and I get to do the electrochemistry. I have no idea how the others can say things about the world outside of iGEM, who has time for a life with all these projects?
Peter Qi
I am a fourth year Bachelor of Health Sciences student (biomedical sciences stream). Before iGEM, my research interests are in obesity and type II diabetes mellitus. I was part of the Calgary iGEM team last year. I am super excited to be part of the iGEM project this year again. I am working towards finding genetic elements that acts as a specific and sensitive sensor for the environmental toxin, naphthenic acids. In my spare time, I like to play basketball, the clarinet, or watch movies.
Adam Hasham
Hey, I’m Adam a second year Chemical Engineering student at the Schulich school of Engineering. This year I helped iGEM Calgary primarily on the bioreactor subgroup making the bioreactor prototype and helping with the Maya animations. This is the first time I have been a part of iGEM and I had a wonderful experience. In my spare time I like to play soccer and video games. I also love traveling with friends and exploring the world. My favorite place in the world is Grenada, Spain because of culture and history of the city.
Ali Honarmand
Hi I’m Ali and I’m starting my third year of biological sciences this fall. iGEM is my first research experience and so far it’s been awesome: Learning about synthetic biology, being part of a great team and having fun. This summer I was part of the desulfurization subgroup mainly mutagenizing genes. I think the best part of iGEM is being able to test new ideas. Besides university I play soccer, bike, run, volunteer, read and snowboard.
Anya Kornilo
I finished my 3rd year as a joint major in Biological and Computer Sciences. I am looking forward to participating in the wet lab component of iGEM this summer. This will be my first time trying out independent research in the lab. I'm excited to be a part of such diverse group of students and can't wait to see what we can come up with! In my spare time I am involved in swimming, gymnastics and enjoy many kinds of music.
Asim Chawdhry
I am an undergraduate student pursuing a double major at the University of Calgary. I am currently in my fourth year of a Bachelor of Science degree majoring in Biological Science, and my third year of a Bachelor of Commerce degree with a specialization in Marketing. This has been my first experience working with iGEM, and I have primarily been involved in the wet lab with the hydrocarbon decarboxylation team. I believe that iGEM provides a great opportunity for students from several different disciplines to get together and combine their knowledge and interests, and work towards a common goal. Whenever given the opportunity, I love going out to the mountains to ski! I am also an avid car enthusiast.
Chenzhe Qian
I’m in my last year of Computer Science and Biological Science in University of Calgary. This program combination is always confusing people. Not many knows what can happen if computer meets biology, a magic. Here is the answer, iGEM! This is my first year in iGEM and I love it. This is the place where I can do exactly what I want to do. I am interested in bioinformatics, genetics, microbiology as well as programming. In past two years, I’ve involved two modeling projects. One is aim to model human kidney in 3D for education purpose, and the other one is using individual-based model to simulate ecology system. In my spare time, I like to do some reading, writing, drawing random things or maybe thinking for nothing.
Colin Brown
Hello, my name is Colin Brown. I am a second year student at the University of Calgary studying mechanical engineering with a biomedical specialization. This past summer was filled with lots of learning about the vast field of synthetic biology, as it was my first year with iGEM Calgary. I came to realize that engineering has many different applications in biotechnology, and is a field I have become very interested in. Over the past few months I helped design our team’s bioreactor, which included design research, computer modeling, and physical prototyping. I am also a sports director with the Engineering Student Society, and am a new member of the formula SAE (society of automotive engineers) design team with UofC. Other interests of mine include hockey, golf, outdoor activities, and spending time with family and friends.
Emily Hicks
This is my fourth summer in iGEM, which probably means that I really need to get a life.  This summer I will be working on both team OSCAR and FRED as well as yelling at people in the lab for leaving the gel boxes open and moving the enzymes.  I’ll no doubt be enjoying the late nights in the lab and hope to learn by the end of the season how to successfully carry a gel from the lab to the imager in one piece.  In my spare time I enjoy beating David at flight control, collecting stuffed pandas and other important tasks.
Jeff Addison
Prior to attending the University of Calgary I completed a Bachelor of Science in Kinesiology at McGill University and am now working towards a second degree in Biology. This is my first iGEM experience and I've really enjoyed the opportunity to develop my research skills and learn from a great team of advisors and fellow students. My work in the lab has been concentrated on the denitrogenation project within the hydrocarbon team. Typically this involves doing endless PCR, digests, and transformations, followed by more PCR. In my spare time I enjoy the outdoors, specifically riding my bike and backcountry hiking/mountaineering, as well as watching my favourite sports teams.
Lisa Oberding
I have just graduated from the University of Calgary with a degree in Cellular, Molecular, and Microbial Biology. This is my first year with iGEM, which I got involved with as a chance to gain more research experience, learn about synthetic biology, and further define my research interests. Outside of the lab I enjoy snowboarding in the Rockies (sliding down the mountain on my face), camping (being chased by angry insects), reading, and drawing (possibly the only two safe hobbies I have- unless you count paper cuts). On the team this year I have mostly been a part of the desulfurization project, as well as helping out with a transposon library screen. And, as of yet, I have not set myself or anything else on fire.
Mike Mooney
I am a biochemistry student entering into the fourth and hopefully final year of my undergraduate degree. I am not yet certain what I'm going to do with this degree, but I have lofty aspirations to go into dentistry in the long term. More likely, I will end up pursuing higher education in biochemistry. iGEM is my first genuine (non-class based) lab experience and has imbued me with the wondrous powers of science. I am very excited to gain some useful and practical knowledge of lab work. In what little spare time I enjoy, I like to draw pictures of things, write about other things, and lie around loudly lamenting how busy I usually am.
Stephanie Willatt
I am going into my third year of biological sciences specializing in Botany. This is my first summer working in a research lab and I am excited about this new experience.  I will mainly be working in the wet lab component. During the summer I hope to gain new knowledge about synthetic biology as well as learn new lab techniques.  Outside of school, I am interested in music, playing the bassoon, cycling and snowboarding.
Tsarina VanWieren
I am entering into my fourth year of Biological Sciences at the University of Calgary. Being involved in iGEM has been a very interesting and exciting experience for me and I have learned a great deal from it. Over the summer I have taken part in the wet lab portion of the research, in finding a means to decarboxylate napthenic acids via microbial modification. I am an active individual who enjoys getting involved in the community, and I am also fond of reading novels, swimming, hiking, travelling, and listening to music. Synthetic biology has always intrigued me, making iGEM a fascinating learning experience, and I have especially enjoyed the strong team aspect of the project.
Chris Wintersinger
I am a Biomedical Sciences major in the University of Calgary's Bachelor of Health Sciences program. I enjoy candlelit dinners, long walks on the beach, and balancing magnesium salt concentrations for creating PCR master mixes. When I'm not in the lab using glucose to repress transcription of S7 micrococcal nuclease, you will find me lusting after beat-up pickup trucks listed on the Internet, or using my Brownie Hawkeye box camera to take pictures that look like I smeared the lens with Vaseline. After I graduate from iGEM, I hope to pursue a career as a chimney sweep, door-to-door vacuum cleaner salesman, or failing those, perhaps a biomedical engineer.
Cooper Davies
I am a third year biological science major, hoping to specialize in genetics further down the road. I really enjoy mostly three things. Reading, Music, and Movies. Kurt Vonnegut, or Joseph Heller would be my favourite authors, and I assume that explains quite a bit about me in and of itself anyway. In my spare time I also enjoy boxing as a sport. This would be my first time doing both iGEM, as well as any actual research at all, and I must say I quite enjoyed it this summer! It was a good time getting to know the the team as well as doing the occasional lab help.
Himika Dastidar
Hi my name is Himika and I am a veteran iGEMer, I was on the Calgary team in 2010. This year I decided to rejoin the team. I recently graduated from Biomedical Sciences honours and will be starting a Masters degree in September 2013. In my free time I do martial arts and painting.
Iain George
I just completed my undergraduate degree in Cellular, Molecular and Microbial Biology at the University of Calgary. Currently, I work in Dr. Howard Ceri and Dr. Ray Turner labs studying how bacterial biofilms can be used to cleanup toxic environments.  My research has focused two species of Pseudomonas that can interact with and possibly degrade naphthenic acids and chlorinated biphenyl while contending with heavy metal conditions. This fall I am beginning a Masters project studying functional genomics in yeast.  This is my first year working with the team and it has given me the great chance to mentor my teammates and learn new skills.  When I am not living in the lab, you'll find me in the amazing mountains and trying my hand at photography.
Jay Wang
I am a third year student in Biomedical Sciences at the University of Calgary.This is my first year in iGEM, but not my first year doing research. I had research experience in gastrointestinal and cardiovascular fields and astrophysics. I am super excited to be part of iGEM because I get the opportunity to explore micro-molecular biology! Unfortunately, I won't be working in wet lab; I will mainly work with the human practice and the business team. In my spare time, I love to volunteer, learn about any fields of science, collecting rocks, stamps, and coins, and watch movies.
Jaya Mishra
Annyeong haseyo! My name is Jaya and I am a student of general biology.  Although I chose this major to explore the diversity of living things, I have recently become interested synthetic biology and its usefulness in solving major issues. I participated on the KillSwitch and Human Practices on the project this summer and thoroughly enjoyed developing and expanding my lab skills. As you can tell from my greeting, I am extremely interested in Korean language, culture and most importantly, entertainment.  Apart from my strange fascination of Korean television, I like learning about invertebrate zoology.
Kevin Huie
I have currently finished my first year of Biological Sciences at the University of Calgary. This is my first year in iGEM as well as my first taste in working on a research project. Being a part of the University of Calgary iGEM team has been and continue to be a great learning experience from hands on work to gaining knowledge from team members’ past experiences I have developed better skills in multitasking and multi-managing. This year I have been working on the wet lab part of the project, in particular the killswitch. I enjoy playing soccer, drawing, building things and hanging out with friends.
Nirab Pant
I joined the Calgary iGEM team after completing my first-year at the UofC and spending the summer with the team has been quite a thrill. The field of synthetic biology is really dynamic and I have been involved mainly in the design and construction of the desulfurization components in the conversion of NAs to useful hydrocarbons, as well as in developing an integrated human practices element to the project.
Patrick Wu
I'm wrapping up my fourth year in Bioinformatics, which means that once I graduate, I will pretend to know both biology and computer science. In reality, the only computer science I can probably do is HTML, and so my primary work this year was building this wiki. And drawing cute things. Both of these responsibilities have made me into a pretty big design geek over the summer. This is my third year in iGEM, and I continue to work against the advice and concerns of my friends and family physician. In my ""spare time"" I draw, do karate, and sleep (a dying art).
Peter Liu
Currently in my second year of Biomedical Sciences at the University of Calgary, I have a passion for any biological research that involves advanced technology, the potential to benefit our society in the long run, and innovative areas that no one else has explored before. Our iGEM project is an ideal example of this type of project. Focusing on the human practice component, I wanted to combine what I have learned as a mock trial competitor, debater, and future scientist to explore the feasibility and any potential obstacles that our project might encounter in the real world. When I don’t have my pipette at hand, glasses on, and juggling between school and humanitarian advocacy campaigns, I volunteer, do martial arts, and coach aspiring ninjas in my city.
Rai Chaudhuri
Hello! My name is Rai and I am a current third year student at the University of Calgary. I am majoring in Biomedical Sciences and minoring in Health and Society. This is my first time being a part of iGEM and I can truly say that it has been a memorable summer. I have learned a lot, made great new friends, and have broken all of my previous records of caffeine intake and sleep deprivation. I have also learned that I am not a fan of parafilming. My response to most things either giggling or threatening to pipette stab. I really enjoy dancing, especially salsa, Bollywood movies, eating spicy food, the colour red, and I have always wanted a tiger cub for a pet.
Roberta Menezes
I have just graduated from University of Southampton, UK, with a BSc (Hons) in Biomedical Sciences. I love spending my summers volunteering in different labs around the world. I have done this previously at the University of Zaragoza, Spain, helping research on atherosclerosis, and at the Evandro Chagas Institute, a centre for tropical disease, in Brazil. It is my first time taking part in iGEM and it has been an amazing experience being involved in the wet lab part of the project. Not only have I experienced the world of synthetic biology, but I have also made many great friends. Some of my hobbies outside of the lab include, painting, dancing, and eating good food!
Zhibek Salimbayeva
Initially from Kazakhstan, Zhibek grew up in the cold heights of the Tian Shan Mountains amongst the country’s symbolic snow leopards. In 2004 she moved to Canada in hopes to start an eagle hunting business with her brother Borat in the prairie provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan. However, due to the strict regulations and small market the business soon went downhill. She is now in her 3rd year of biological sciences at the University of Calgary, and is hoping to pursue the field of Medicine. Her favorite cuisine includes Kazakh traditional horsemeat sausages (kazy), roasted sheep head, and salty cheese balls (qurut). In her spare time she practices archery, camel riding and playing music on a dombra.
Dr. Anders Nygren
I have a PhD from Rice University, Houston, Texas, and MSc degrees from the University of Houston, Texas and the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm, Sweden. I am an Associate Professor in the Centre for Bioengineering Research & Education and the Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering at the University of Calgary. My main research interests deal with the electrophysiology of the heart, using a combination of experimental measurements and computer modeling. I realized a few years ago that the modeling methods used in this research also can be applied to an area I knew nothing about at the time: Synthetic Biology. This is the fourth time I am involved as one of the facilitators for a U of C iGEM team.
Dr. Doug Muench
I am a Plant Cell Biology Professor in the Department of Biological Sciences at the University of Calgary. I completed a PhD in Genetics at the University of Alberta and spent a few years as a Postdoctoral Researcher at the Institute of Biological Chemistry, Washington State University. My main research focus is on the study of subcellular dynamics, however, this past year my research group initiated a project on the identification of plant genes that are important in the reclamation of tailings ponds. As an iGEM rookie myself, it’s exciting to see a group of students with diverse backgrounds come together and use their individual expertise to approach an important environmental problem.
Dr. Lisa Gieg
I have been doing research in the field of environmental microbiology for about 20 years. I hold a Ph.D. from the University of Alberta, and worked for a dozen years as a PDF and Senior Researcher at the University of Oklahoma before coming to the University of Calgary as an Assistant Professor in Biological Sciences. My research focuses on petroleum metabolism by microbes in the context of oil spill clean-up, microbial enhanced energy recovery, and in oil sands tailings ponds remediation. This is my second year being involved with iGEM. It is a pleasure to work with dynamic, smart, and talented students and colleagues who are exploring the use of synthetic biology to solve real world problems.
Dr. Mayi Arcellana-Panlilio
I am an adjunct associate professor in the Department of Biochemistry & Molecular Biology. I have been involved with teaching/mentoring in the Bachelor of Health Sciences program since 2003, primarily to develop and deliver the Honours Cell & Molecular Biology course, a core requirement in the curriculum. I have taught every offering of that course and received numerous accolades from the Faculty and the students, most recently winning the Teaching Excellence Award for 2010-2011 from the University of Calgary Students Union. This is my second year as an iGEM Instructor and my interest in the program springs from my belief in the value of inquiry as a means to getting students engaged in the pursuit of knowledge and developing habits of becoming lifelong learners.
David Lloyd
This is my fourth year being involved in iGEM in which time I have had the opportunity to work with the Alberta team for two years as an undergraduate and now as a team advisor for Calgary for the second year. I am in the process of completing my MSc in Biochemistry and have many interests including Genetics, Immunology, Cell Biology, Bioinformatics, and Microbiology. In the future, I hope to merge my passions for Biochemistry, Cell Biology, and Synthetic Biology into an exciting career, opening up a biotechnology company around biological solutions to everyday problems. iGEM has been an amazing opportunity and I greatly look forward to another year in the competition!
Dylan Silver
Dylan is a 4th-year Ph.D. candidate in Plant Biochemistry studying starch metabolism. First-time member of iGEM, he joined the 2012 University of Calgary team as a Senior Advisor after learning about the intriguing and challenging project focused on the remediation of oil sand tailings ponds. His extensive knowledge in molecular biology and enzymology provides assistance to students with their experimental design and troubleshooting. Dylan is thrilled to be part of the iGEM team – an enriching community that offers valuable experience for future endeavors in research and development in synthetic biology.
Maggie Renaud-Young
I am in my fourth year of the Biochemistry and Molecular Biology PhD program in the Southern Alberta Cancer Biology Research Group at the University of Calgary. The focus of my studies is the cellular response to obstructed DNA replication, and how disturbances to this process contribute to genome instability using the budding yeast model system. This is the second year that I have worked with iGEM and it is has been a great experience for me.  I really enjoy the team approach of taking composite parts to build systems that can perform unique biological functions.  I love the social aspect of being on the team and I especially look forward to attending the Jamborees.

About the University
Calgary
Calgary is the largest city in Alberta, and has a population of over 1 million.  It was founded in 1875, when the RCMP erected Fort Calgary (then Fort Brisebois) to protect the western plains from whiskey traders. When the Canadian Pacific Railway reached the area in 1883, Calgary grew into an important commercial and agricultural center. Currently, Calgary's economy is dominated by the oil and gas industry, and major attractions include Canada Olympic Park (the site of the 1988 Winter Olympics), Calaway Park, the Lilac Festival, and the Calgary Stampede (touted as the Greatest Outdoor Show on Earth founded in 1912).  Calgary is also situated near the Rocky Mountains, and plays host to a unique weather phenomenom called the chinook. Famous Calgarians include the young, incumbent mayor, Naheed Nenshi, who is the first Muslim to become mayor of a major Canadian city, as well as the current Prime Minister of Canada, Conservative party leader Stephen Harper.
The University of Calgary
The University of Calgary is ranked as one of Canada’s top comprehensive research institutions. Currently, more than 30,500 students are enrolled in 14 faculties in undergraduate, graduate and professional degree programs. The University contains more than 30 research institutions and centres, including the O’Brien Centre within which iGEM Calgary operates. The university is also the birthplace of many inventions including the neurochip, and has had 140,000 alumni since its founding in 1966.
iGEM Lab Space
The University of Calgary iGEM team would like to thank the O' Brien Centre for the Bachelor of Health Sciences Program and the Department of Biological Sciences for providing lab space for our team.  The O'Brien Centre is located in the Foothills campus of the University of Calgary. It has provided the iGEM team with lab space as well as funding ever since the University started fielding iGEM teams. The O’Brien Centre is the hub of top-notch interdisciplinary research and education. It funds approximately 9 million dollars a year for research. The department of Biological Sciences donated a teaching laboratory as lab space for our iGEM students to work in during the months of June - August.  We would like to thank the entire department for their support of our team.

Wet Lab Works:
The laboratory that we used belongs to Prof. Mahinur Akkaya, who is also our instructor. We are very glad for her great support to our team and for the all stuff that she presented us and we present our happiness here.  The PCR machine (we call it “umut”(in English ,hope)) and the water bath we got from  Assoc. Prof. Cagdas Son. Furthermore, Assoc. Prof. Yesim Aydin Son helped us very much in our bioinformatic issues. Thanks to all!
We used the experience and some materials from last year's METU iGEM team. Furthermore, the most of the protocols that we used in wet lab were provided to us by Taylan Beyaztas, our wet lab advisor, we are very grateful to him for his great support. Also, we thank to our other wet lab advisor Çaglar Özketen for his help. Some parts that we finished are retrieved from Baskent Medical IGEM team. Also we used the Kill switch part from Berkeley`s system.
The whole wet lab works were done by undergraduate students, from freshmen to senior students, from lab cleaning up to transformations or gel extraction. We always prepared our own gels, or plates from zero. We should be thankful to all students who have worked hard there... Berke, Seda ,Alisan, Burak, Selin, Kübra, Özge, Oguz, Emre, Ekin, Gözde and Özgün.
Berke was the mastermind behind igem metu 2012. Without him, we would not have come together to form our new friendships and we would never have gotten the chance to get this much fun and experience.
Hifzissihha Ankara provided us with a Mycobacterium bovis vaccine from which we isolated our needed CODH gene, they appeared in the very last second and literally saved our project.
Modeling:
The whole models for our system were created by our team member Melike Dönertas. We don`t know what we would have done without her help?
Wiki design:
The main structure of the wiki is created by Hasan Fehmi Danaci, who is a software team member, with the help of Gökhan Ersoy, who is our advisor. Moreover, Buse Isbilir and Kübra Narci presented their help in filling the page.
Photographs and the Videos:
The photograph and the video all are taken by the members of the team. Video on our page was clustered up Oguz Bolgi.
Funding:
Our master of coin here is Özgün Kirdar, most of the time he tried to find sponsors, and moreover he managed our flight and reservations.
Our Sponsors:
First of all we are very grateful to our Universities president, Prof.Dr Ahmet Acar, he offered us lots of materials to use in the laboratory and presented the moral support.
Metutech presented us the application fees.
GüvenVakfi corresponded our travel allowance.
Atasim modelled our team logo and provided our T-shirts.
Collobration:
We provided Baskent Medical iGEM team with biobricks they are going to use from the kit plates, for a double check, of the parts they were having a problem with. It was a two sided collobration whereas we also had some biobricks from them that we had problems with.
We completed the survey of Ciencias UNAM team. Moreover, we collobrate with TU München iGEM  team with their survey also, here is their gift to us!

Berke Gürkan
 
Boss (Demi-God)
Hi, this is Berke Gürkan from METU iGEM team 2012. I am a '12 graduate from Middle East Technical University department of Molecular Biology and Genetics. It is my second year in iGEM. I met synthetic biology and iGEM during my Erasmus year in The Netherlands, Groningen; where I immediately fell in love with the whole idea of creating genetically engineered machines that are able to do the tasks which I program them to. Believeing synthetic biology is one of the key subjects for taking biological sciences one step further and creating the lifestyle of tomorrow I started the iGEM 2012 team in METU. Through the process I learned even further and had a greater vision of synthetic biology which keeps fascinating me every single day. It is just incredible to design a biological system which can help the world get rid of the problems they normally cannot by physical means. This year I had quite a lot of fun working on the project with the most awesome team members. All together we hope to add a notch to synthetic biology in the upcoming years.

Alisan Kayabölen
 
Wet Lab (Insomnia in person)
I am Alisan Kayabölen. I’ve just graduated from Molecular Biology and Genetics department and this year I’m starting my master study at Biomedical Engineering, METU.                                  Until this summer, I couldn’t do anything at “genetics” side of my own department. I studied on stem cells and tissue engineering fields during my internship and special project course. So, iGEM was a huge chance for me to study genetics and learn many techniques about synthetic biology. My dream is to be able to combine tissue engineering and synthetic biology fields.                                 I’ve worked mainly at wet lab part of our team. And, I also tried to find sponsors for our project, but it is difficult to say that I was very successful?

Funding & Human Practice (Half-Giant)
My name is Özgün Kirdar, a second year student at the Biology Department in METU.  I am a wetlab asisstant and also responsible for human practices and sponsorships in our team. Before deciding what I want to do in future, I want to learn and experience the fields of biology as much as I can.                                  Why iGEM ? Because I think iGEM is the best option for me to gain experience at synthetic biology.                                  I don't  have a good suggestion to new iGEM teams, because I am also new to iGEM. I can only                                  say '' Do your best and try to have some fun. ''.

Wet Lab (Looks Like Jesus)
I’m Emre Ilpars, a second year student at the Department of Biology in METU.  In our team, I have mainly worked on wet lab as an assistant and helped to my friends in human practices. As a Biology student, I didn’t know the basics of molecular biology but these lab experiences really helped me to learn new information and techniques from the seniors.  Because there are a lot of field in Biology, I haven’t decide what I am going to do in future but thanks to my iGEM experiences I am started to think that I will study on synthetic biology.

My name is Burak ÖZCAN and I am a senior student in Biology department in METU. I have mainly worked in wet lab part of iGEM team but I have also take a role in the sponsorship and the human practice parts of our team.  I think being an iGEM member is a great challenge to overcome and the experience of working on a project of our own is a unique gift for an undergraduate student like us. Solving problems of our own is another crucial opportunity that we could achieve. I believe on the light of these experiences I will fallow path that leads me great success.

Hi I’m Selin :) I’m a senior student at Biology department of METU. I have also minor in Molecular Biology and Genetics. I mainly take charge in wet lab part of the team but I also participate in human practice part and I really enjoyed :) I think our time is “-omics” era and I want to built my future carrier in  this world via using knowledge that I learned from my iGEM experiences. Because I think iGEM is a very good opportunity to learn how to overcome to obstacles while you keep moving on your own way.

I’m Oguz Bolgi a second year student at the Molecular Biology and Genetics Department in METU.  My position in our team is that of an assistant actually, I try to learn the techniques from our seniors by assisting them and later on I get my hands dirty by trying out my new learned techniques. I want to learn as much as possible because I want to continue in the field of synthetic biology.                                  To the question, why iGEM, I have only one answer, why not?                                  My suggestion to new iGEM teams would be to work hard, buy lots of coffee and have tons of fun.                                 .

Spencer Chen
Some people think Spencer is a pretty nice guy. But what they don’t know is Spencer can be quite the liar. For example, ask him who the smarter twin is and he’ll say himself. Spencer however, is definitely the meaner twin. Whether any of this is true is up to you.
Spencer likes to read Ancient Greek and Roman literature, which has limited to no real-world application to his life. He is however, passionate about immunology and genetics research. He is a freak of nature with many bodily disorders. For example, his arms and legs are different lengths. He idolizes Thomas Keller and secretly wants to drop out and make haute cuisine for a living.
Steven Chen
Some people think Steven is a pretty nice guy. But what they don’t know is Steven can be quite the liar. For example, ask him who the smarter twin is and he’ll say himself. Steven however, is definitely the nicer twin. Whether any of this is true is up to you.
Steven is also strangely obsessed with all things Medieval Europe but that is about all that makes him interesting; he is actually a really boring person. His research interests are in the field of biochemistry, cell biology, biomedical engineering-- though why these interest him I couldn’t begin to understand. Steven really likes eating bread. He likes his bread plain, just like his personality.
Maneesh Gupta
A true Renaissance man, and a true ladies man. Any task you give Maneesh, from PCR to programming, will be done flawlessly. Just don’t try to get him to leave his house in the process. He’s the master of all things barbecue and Boolean, tasty and triangulated, mathematical and manly. But vegetarians beware, he's Maneesh Gupta, and he’s so delicious.
Danielle Huang
Danielle, ""the overachiever"" always aims for higher goals. Her schedule is packed just like that of a Hollywood star, except that she doesn't act, but she truly enjoys keeping herself busy and productive. What an exemplary student. Over the summer break, she worked very hard to contribute to Cornell iGEM until the day before she left Cornell for a co-op at Johnson & Johnson. We miss you Danielle!
Dan Levine
While most of us are water-based, Dan is not water-based. He enjoys long walks on the tight-rope, bumpy rides on the pommel horse, gliding through the atmosphere , and protein-heavy meals. If you are what you eat, then Dan is a bowl of non-fat Chobani yogurt (the serving spoon being a vanilla-flavored Power Bar). However, a cranial examination reveals Dan is wired to circuit-boards and graphics cards. At a glance, his computer models could be mistaken for supermodels. Needless to say, Dan is popular among ladies.
Rafael Lizarralde
Averages 200 + APM in StarCraft II, makes chimeric polymerases in his spare time, and proficiently speaks four languages - Rafael is a modern day renaissance man. His brain surpasses Amazon's servers with the storage capacity approximately equal to a googlebyte or three of data. After majoring in Biological Engineering, Rafael plans to go to graduate school. In graduate school, it is rumored that Rafael plans to study meat science and the art of turf grass management. Rafael's career aspirations are to win a couple of Nobel prizes and designation as Cosmo's ""Man Candy of the Year.""
Kelvin Luu
There are only 10 types of people on Cornell iGEM: Kelvin Luu, and those who wish they could count like Kelvin Luu. Basically, the man’s a G – a Graphics G. Beyond website design and Android coding, Kelvin enjoys orienting objects and warping System.time with his compsci genius. Other talents involve staying up past 4 AM and making burnt hash browns.
Jim Mathew
An elocutionist so suave you'd think he speaks in songs of the Sirens. But don't let his baby face and sunny smile fool you. Featured four times on the front cover of Nature, Forbes, and Maxim's Hot 100, Jim seamlessly integrates his wizardry in chemical engineering and applied economics into a leader's conviction that's not to be taken lightly.
Jim has been especially prolific the past couple of years. He coined the acronym YOLO after wrestling black bears on one of his favorite morning hikes in the great outdoors. As an esteemed member of the Cornell Consulting Group, Jim personally advised Carly Rae Jepsen to append ""maybe"" to her signature call phrase, single-handedly launching her path to fame. He founded the student organization ""Nebraskans at Cornell,"" for which he juggles all the responsibilities as president, treasurer, social chair, and...sole member.
Sorry, ladies, but this bro's heart already belongs to a special someone.
Eric Morris
From an early age, Eric wanted to be a cyborg. In summer 2011, he achieved this goal through the use of a zero point module and some custom-designed recursive nanobots. Now that he's done it, though, life is a little different. Editing HTML and writing regular expressions is a breeze, but visual pattern-recognition has definitely taken a hit. Dreaming in XML has its advantages; it facilitates storage and playback of Eric's dreams on most video-enabled devices. However, it means Eric's rapid eye movement during sleep occasionally undergoes catastrophic subtraction. Try not to be in the room when that happens, because it can cause a bit of a shockwave.
Claire Paduano
One day, Claire met the Energizer Bunny and decided that she wanted to be better than him. So she sat up, jumped out of her crib and got to work. Ever since that fateful day, Claire has conquered every obstacle in her path. Whether it’s imaging mouse brains, dancing on Sitara, solving Quantum Electrodynamics problems or saving Cornell iGEM from certain doom, Claire can do it all.
Shweta Patro
Not much can be said about Shweta – her radiance can only be captured through the joyous harmonies of pop music. After all, she lights up our world like nobody else. The way she flips her hair gets us overwhelmed. Our princess of vlogging, our proponent of public education, and Swati’s beloved twin, she comes with only one disclaimer: after midnight, nothing that she says can be held against her. If only we were her boyfriend, we’d never let her go.
Caleb Radens
Caleb gets the best miniprep yields because he is magic. Other examples of his hoodoo voodoo are as follows: Caleb can turn invisible, but chooses not to; he can breathe while underwater, but finds it distasteful; he can levitate birds, but laments that nobody seems to care. Also, Caleb has always found it curious that he can't remember not existing, and has thus concluded that he must be immortal. Lately, he's considered the possibility that the universe is merely a product of his mind, and that we'd all cease to exist if he were to die. After cogitating on whether such a view would commit him to solipsism, he's concluded that other minds can exist within the gestalt of a greater, emergent consciousness – viz., his own.
Paras Sanghavi
Paras eats electricity for breakfast, and is also known as one of the original 151 Pokémon. To the unacquainted stranger, Paras appears to be an ambitious member of the dry lab team, but can defeat Chuck Norris in any sort of competion, be it a contest of strength, speed, agility, or facial hair.  A man of fine taste, my boy Paras is now a fan of Latin, so I'll finish off the bio with a bit of the classics.  Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.  Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat.
Chie Shu
Simply put, Chie can do everything. You can find her in our wet lab, dry lab and mathematical modeling teams. With a wild background from a Japanese all-girl high school and taiko drumming (Yamatai), she would also sit down at a piano to play classical music and cook delicious Asian food.  Her love for cats has reached the level where she can now talk to them (seriously). We suspect her reason for joining iGEM is to steal Claire’s cute cats.
Mark Simpson
As the God of Making Electrocompetent Stocks, it is appropriate that Mark has taken the mighty lightning bolt as his emblem. Like Almighty Zeus, one day Mark too may smite enemies with his bolts of vengeance and seduce nyiads, mortals, and nymphs alike. But, for better or for worse, as of yet Mark draws most of his power not from his promiscuity, but from his cell-washing prowess – we can only hope that he will soon take up the baton of social chair (passed to him against his will, probably because he wasn’t in the room to protest) and buy the team a round of pepperoni pizza.
Tina Su
Currently a sophomore Chemistry major, Tina is interested in just about everything. Her passion for learning has allowed her to be one of two people who span both the wetlab and drylab. Her dependability in interjecting with at least one question has allowed us to lovingly nickname her the 'Random Question Generator.' Tina brings lots of hard work and dedication to the team, the same of which can be seen in her hobbies, such as running three miles a day. The team really needs her ability to be thorough while managing her >20 credits and researching for CUGEM, and not just because nobody else is small enough to be the subject in analogies involving the size of our Pelican bioreactor encasement. Tina is incredibly caring and friendly, but if you still need something to talk about, simply mention yogurt. Or bread. Or Feynman.
Swati Sureka
In the panhandle of Florida, born and raised
In the lab is where she now spends most of her days
First stop, up. Then second stop down.
Such precision and skill, she deserves her crown.
Once, a couple of bubbles that were up to no good,
Started making trouble in the fume hood.
Swati used her powers to flick em out the tip, yeah
Everyone agrees: Man, she's a trip!
Upstairs, for the purpose of quantification
Swati never really does take a vacation
Nanodrop. Load up, wait for the click.
Concentration: 10 million. Wow, she's slick!
Manny Valdez
There was once a chemical engineer who feared no machine.
His name was Manny Valdez, and he frequently dominated Pita Pit.
On iGEM, he is our tank.
When you need to bring in the big guns.
When you need to break out the machines.
When you need to CAD the **** outta some Septimus.
You call Manny Valdez.
He rumored to have DJ prowess on par with deadmau5.
Lydia Wang
Lydia is a unique specimen in the Cornell iGEM team. Not only is she one of the rare electrical engineers that have been ensnared by iGEM, but she also has shown an incredible skillset in the electronics lab. These include the ability to communicate to electronics and defy the laws of physics. When she is not busy trying to move batteries in Phillips 228, she is often seen showing off her magnificent rowing skills for the dragon boat team.
Dylan Webster
Dylan visited our world when our universe's membrane collided with an adjacent one. A being composed of energy, but not matter, he chooses to veil himself in a human guise because he found the stares distracting. Because he exists independently of time, he experiences all of time simultaneously, and does not believe in free will. When we asked him whether he could tell us if we'll win, he simply shook his head and replied cryptically ""If you immediately know the candle light is fire, then the meal was cooked long ago"".
Robert Zhang
His memory, photographic. His vision, legendary.      On a mission to Weill Hall, he once sniped a rogue Shewanella at 400 yards.      He logged its last words, recounting all meals, behaviors, and decisions performed before the kill.
In lab he can be found crafting tools for our next challenge, working on the latest iteration of Septimus Prime. He is rumored to live a double life as a Deus Ex Aug. With a sweet pair of shades.
Faculty Advisors
Dr. Lars Angenent - Biological and Environmental Engineering
Lars Angenent is interested in converting organic materials with undefined mixed cultures, defined mixed cultures, or pure cultures of microbes to generate specific products, such as the energy carriers – methane; carboxylates; electric current; n-butanol. Pretreatment of the biomass may be necessary to increase the conversion rates, and therefore Lars Angenent is also interested in physical/chemical (e.g., dilute acid method), thermochemical (e.g., slow pyrolysis), and biological pretreatment steps. In regards to bioprocessing steps, Lars Angenent studies anaerobic digestion, anaerobic fermentation, bioelectrochemical systems, syngas fermentation, and ABE fermentation. Other areas of interest are biosensors and biocomputing devices that are based on bioelectrochemical systems (BESs); and photobioreactors.
For organic waste conversion into bioenergy, Lars Angenent is promoting the carboxylate platform as an important platform in biorefineries because water and nutrients must be recycled while bioenergy yields must be maximized. This platform is based on microbial conversions with undefined mixed cultures that can handle the complexity and variability of organic wastes. Therefore, Lars Angenent is interested in the microbial community dynamics in engineered systems. For this reason, his lab utilizes second-generation sequencing platforms in combination with powerful bioinformatic tools and ecology theory.
Dr. Shivaun Archer - Biomedical Engineering
Dr. Shivaun Archer is a Senior Lecturer in charge of the Biomedical Engineering Undergraduate Instructional Laboratories. She designs and teaches undergraduate instructional labs for five biomedical engineering courses: BME 131, BME 301, BME 302, BME 401, and BME 402. The labs are designed to illustrate the course material and bring research to undergraduate education whilst exposing students to cutting edge technology and research methodology. A significant emphasis in all the labs is biomedical nanotechnology. Each of the five courses has a hands-on lab module that focuses specifically on nanobiotechnology. Overall, the lab modules enhance the hands-on training of Cornell students in the areas of microfabrication, microfluidics, biosensors, nano/microbiotechnology, and drug delivery. In recognition of her efforts in undergraduate education, Dr. Archer has received a prestigious College of Engineering Teaching award.
Before coming to Cornell, Dr. Archer worked for five years at Lynntech, Inc. a small research company specializing in biotechnology, biomaterials, chemical and biological sensors, medical biotechnology, and environmental remediation. Her work on wastewater treatment for long term space missions resulted in her receiving two NASA Inventions Space Act Awards. She also holds a joint appointment as a Research Associate in the School of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering. Her research interests include nanobiotechnology and tissue engineering.
Dr. Matthew DeLisa - Chemical Engineering
Matthew DeLisa received his B.S. in Chemical Engineering from the University of Connecticut in 1996; his Ph.D. in Chemical Engineering from the University of Maryland in 2001; and did postdoctoral work at the University of Texas-Austin, Department of Chemical Engineering. DeLisa joined the Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering at Cornell University as an assistant professor in 2003 and was promoted to associate professor in 2009. He recently served as a Gastprofessur at ETH Zürich in the Institut für Mikrobiologie.
Professor DeLisa's research focuses on understanding and controlling the molecular mechanisms underlying protein biogenesis -- folding and assembly, membrane translocation and post-translational modifications -- in the complex environment of a living cell. His contributions to science and engineering include the invention of numerous commercially important technologies for facilitating the discovery, design and manufacturing of human drugs and seminal discoveries in the areas of cellular protein folding and protein translocation. DeLisa has received several awards for his work including an NSF CAREER award, a NYSTAR Watson Young Investigator award, a Beckman Foundation Young Investigator award, an Office of Naval Research Young Investigator award, and a NYSTAR Distinguished Faculty Award. He was also named one of the top 35 young innovators (TR35) by MIT's Technology Review in 2005 and was selected as the inaugural recipient of the Wiley-Blackwell Biotechnology and Bioengineering Daniel I.C. Wang award, which honors a distinguished young researcher in this field. Most recently, he was honored with a Cornell Provost's Award for Distinguished Scholarship and was the recipient of the Young Investigator Award from the American Chemical Society's BIOT division.
Dr. Jeff Gralnick - Microbiology, University of Minnesota
Jeffrey Gralnick has extensively studied the physiology of Shewanella, a species of gram-negative bacteria found throughout the world in aquatic environments. By understanding the molecular mechanism that enables this species to respire a diversity of compounds - including insoluble minerals - he hopes to engineer strains that can generate power in microbial fuel cells or react against certain toxic metals in the environment.
Working in collaboration with Prof. Daniel Bond, Gralnick made a key discovery about how bacteria can convert organic compounds into electricity. It was observed that riboflavin (commonly known as vitamin B-2) was responsible for much of the energy produced by Shewanella bacteria growing on electrodes. Riboflavin produced by the bacteria was able to carry electrons from the living cells to the electrodes, and rates of electricity production increased by 370 percent as riboflavin accumulated. This finding has major implications for the development of scaled-up microbial fuel cells using similar bacteria.
Gralnick is developing strains, tools and techniques for increasing the robustness of using Shewanella for metabolic engineering and downstream applications in both Bioenergy (microbial fuel cells), Bioremediation and Biocatalysis.
Dr. Bruce Land - Electrical and Computer Engineering
Bruce Land is a Senior Lecturer in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Cornell. He teaches three courses in ECE and advises masters of engineering projects in ECE and Biomedical Engineering. When time allows, he does some neural modeling and spike train analysis. He has been in this position since 1998.
Land received a BS in physics from Harvey Mudd College in 1968 and a Ph.D. in neurobiology from Cornell University in 1976 . He was a Muscular Dystrophy Association postdoc in NBB at Cornell for three years, then a lecturer in NBB for seven years. During this time he worked with Miriam Salpeter on the coupling of activity at the vertebrate neuromuscular junction, both experimentally and by computer modeling. In 1987 he moved to the Cornell Theory Center as a computational research associate, then started supporting graphics and animation. He was visualization project leader at the CTC from 1989 to 1998. From 1992 to 1998 he taught an introductory computer graphics course in Computer Science at Cornell. From 1998 to 2007 he taught computer programming and electronics courses in NBB and was a Senior Research Associate in Neurobiology and Behavior.
Dr. Xiling Shen - Electrical and Computer Engineering
Dr. Xiling Shen has been an assistant professor in the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Cornell University since August 2009.
Born in Shanghai, China, Dr. Xiling Shen went on to receive his BS and MS degree from the Electrical Engineering Department of Stanford University in 2001. He then worked at Barcelona Design Inc. for two years, specializing in analog circuit design and optimization, before joining Professor Mark Horowtiz' research group in the Electrical Engineering Department at Stanford in 2003. In the first two years of his PhD, he collaborated with Professor Joseph Kahn on using adaptive spatial equalization to compensate modal dispersion in multimode fibers. From 2005 to 2008, he worked with Professor Harley McAdams, Professor Lucy Shapiro, and Professor David Dill on modeling and analyzing the asymmetric division of Caulobacter crescentus. Xiling’s postdoctoral work focused on synthetic biology with Dr. Adam Arkin in Bioengineering at UC Berkeley prior to joining the faculty at Cornell University’s School of Electrical and Computer Engineering.

Team Members
Spencer Chen
Some people think Spencer is a pretty nice guy. But what they don’t know is Spencer can be quite the liar. For example, ask him who the smarter twin is and he’ll say himself. Spencer however, is definitely the meaner twin. Whether any of this is true is up to you.
Spencer likes to read Ancient Greek and Roman literature, which has limited to no real-world application to his life. He is however, passionate about immunology and genetics research. He is a freak of nature with many bodily disorders. For example, his arms and legs are different lengths. He idolizes Thomas Keller and secretly wants to drop out and make haute cuisine for a living.
Steven Chen
Some people think Steven is a pretty nice guy. But what they don’t know is Steven can be quite the liar. For example, ask him who the smarter twin is and he’ll say himself. Steven however, is definitely the nicer twin. Whether any of this is true is up to you.
Steven is also strangely obsessed with all things Medieval Europe but that is about all that makes him interesting; he is actually a really boring person. His research interests are in the field of biochemistry, cell biology, biomedical engineering-- though why these interest him I couldn’t begin to understand. Steven really likes eating bread. He likes his bread plain, just like his personality.
Maneesh Gupta
A true Renaissance man, and a true ladies man. Any task you give Maneesh, from PCR to programming, will be done flawlessly. Just don’t try to get him to leave his house in the process. He’s the master of all things barbecue and Boolean, tasty and triangulated, mathematical and manly. But vegetarians beware, he's Maneesh Gupta, and he’s so delicious.
Danielle Huang
Danielle, ""the overachiever"" always aims for higher goals. Her schedule is packed just like that of a Hollywood star, except that she doesn't act, but she truly enjoys keeping herself busy and productive. What an exemplary student. Over the summer break, she worked very hard to contribute to Cornell iGEM until the day before she left Cornell for a co-op at Johnson & Johnson. We miss you Danielle!
Dan Levine
While most of us are water-based, Dan is not water-based. He enjoys long walks on the tight-rope, bumpy rides on the pommel horse and protein-heavy meals. If you are what you eat, then Dan is a bowl of non-fat Chobani yogurt (the serving spoon being a vanilla-flavored Power Bar). However, a cranial examination reveals Dan is wired to circuit-boards and graphics cards. At a glance, his computer models could be mistaken for supermodels. Needless to say, Dan is popular among ladies.
Rafael Lizarralde
Averages 200 + APM in StarCraft II, makes chimeric polymerases in his spare time, and proficiently speaks four languages - Rafael is a modern day renaissance man. His brain surpasses Amazon's servers with the storage capacity approximately equal to a googlebyte or three of data. After majoring in Biological Engineering, Rafael plans to go to graduate school. In graduate school, it is rumored that Rafael plans to study meat science and the art of turf grass management. Rafael's career aspirations are to win a couple of Nobel prizes and designation as Cosmo's ""Man Candy of the Year.""
Kelvin Luu
There are only 10 types of people on Cornell iGEM: Kelvin Luu, and those who wish they could count like Kelvin Luu. Basically, the man’s a G – a Graphics G. Beyond website design and Android coding, Kelvin enjoys orienting objects and warping System.time with his compsci genius. Other talents involve staying up past 4 AM and making burnt hash browns.
Jim Mathew
An elocutionist so suave you'd think he speaks in songs of the Sirens. But don't let his baby face and sunny smile fool you. Featured four times on the front cover of Nature, Forbes, and Maxim's Hot 100, Jim seamlessly integrates his wizardry in chemical engineering and applied economics into a leader's conviction that's not to be taken lightly.
Jim has been especially prolific the past couple of years. He coined the acronym YOLO after wrestling black bears on one of his favorite morning hikes in the great outdoors. As an esteemed member of the Cornell Consulting Group, Jim personally advised Carly Rae Jepsen to append ""maybe"" to her signature call phrase, single-handedly launching her path to fame. He founded the student organization ""Nebraskans at Cornell,"" for which he juggles all the responsibilities as president, treasurer, social chair, and...sole member.
Sorry, ladies, but this bro's heart already belongs to a special someone.
Eric Morris
I don't know who you are. I don't know what you want. If you are looking for ransom, I can tell you I don't have money. But what I do have are a very particular set of skills; skills I have acquired over a very long career. Skills that make me a nightmare for people like you. If you let my daughter go now, that'll be the end of it. I will not look for you, I will not pursue you. But if you don't, I will look for you, I will find you, and I will kill you.
Claire Paduano
One day, Claire met the Energizer Bunny and decided that she wanted to be better than him. So she sat up, jumped out of her crib and got to work. Ever since that fateful day, Claire has conquered every obstacle in her path. Whether it’s imaging mouse brains, dancing on Sitara, solving Quantum Electrodynamics problems or saving Cornell iGEM from certain doom, Claire can do it all.
Shweta Patro
Not much can be said about Shweta – her radiance can only be captured through the joyous harmonies of pop music. After all, she lights up our world like nobody else. The way she flips her hair gets us overwhelmed. Our princess of vlogging, our proponent of public education, and Swati’s beloved twin, she comes with only one disclaimer: after midnight, nothing that she says can be held against her. If only we were her boyfriend, we’d never let her go.
Caleb Radens
Caleb gets the best miniprep yields because he is magic. Other examples of his hoodoo voodoo are as follows: Caleb can turn invisible, but chooses not to; he can breathe while underwater, but finds it distasteful; he can levitate birds, but laments that nobody seems to care. Also, Caleb has always found it curious that he can't remember not existing, and has thus concluded that he must be immortal. Lately, he's considered the possibility that the universe is merely a product of his mind, and that we'd all cease to exist if he were to die. After cogitating on whether such a view would commit him to solipsism, he's concluded that other minds can exist within the gestalt of a greater, emergent consciousness – viz., his own.
Paras Sanghavi
Paras eats electricity for breakfast, and is also known as one of the original 151 Pokémon. To the unacquainted stranger, Paras appears to be an ambitious member of the dry lab team, but can defeat Chuck Norris in any sort of competion, be it a contest of strength, speed, agility, or facial hair.  A man of fine taste, my boy Paras is now a fan of Latin, so I'll finish off the bio with a bit of the classics.  Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.  Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat.
Chie Shu
Simply put, Chie can do everything. You can find her in our wet lab, dry lab and mathematical modeling teams. With a wild background from a Japanese all-girl high school and taiko drumming (Yamatai), she would also sit down at a piano to play classical music and cook delicious Asian food.  Her love for cats has reached the level where she can now talk to them (seriously). We suspect her reason for joining iGEM is to steal Claire’s cute cats.
Mark Simpson
As the God of Making Electrocompetent Stocks, it is appropriate that Mark has taken the mighty lightning bolt as his emblem. Like Almighty Zeus, one day Mark too may smite enemies with his bolts of vengeance and seduce nyiads, mortals, and nymphs alike. But, for better or for worse, as of yet Mark draws most of his power not from his promiscuity, but from his cell-washing prowess – we can only hope that he will soon take up the baton of social chair (passed to him against his will, probably because he wasn’t in the room to protest) and buy the team a round of pepperoni pizza.
Tina Su
Currently a sophomore Chemistry major, Tina is interested in just about everything. Her passion for learning has allowed her to be one of two people who span both the wetlab and drylab. Her dependability in interjecting with at least one question has allowed us to lovingly nickname her the 'Random Question Generator.' Tina brings lots of hard work and dedication to the team, the same of which can be seen in her hobbies, such as running three miles a day. The team really needs her ability to be thorough while managing her >20 credits and researching for CUGEM, and not just because nobody else is small enough to be the subject in analogies involving the size of our Pelican bioreactor encasement. Tina is incredibly caring and friendly, but if you still need something to talk about, simply mention yogurt. Or bread. Or Feynman.
Swati Sureka
In the panhandle of Florida, born and raised
In the lab is where she now spends most of her days
First stop, up. Then second stop down.
Such precision and skill, she deserves her crown.
Once, a couple of bubbles that were up to no good,
Started making trouble in the fume hood.
Swati used her powers to flick em out the tip, yeah
Everyone agrees: Man, she's a trip!
Upstairs, for the purpose of quantification
Swati never really does take a vacation
Nanodrop. Load up, wait for the click.
Concentration: 10 million. Wow, she's slick!
Manny Valdez
There was once a chemical engineer who feared no machine.
His name was Manny Valdez, and he frequently dominated Pita Pit.
On iGEM, he is our tank.
When you need to bring in the big guns.
When you need to break out the machines.
When you need to CAD the **** outta some Septimus.
You call Manny Valdez.
He rumored to have DJ prowess on par with deadmau5.
Lydia Wang
Lydia is a unique specimen in the Cornell iGEM team. Not only is she one of the rare electrical engineers that have been ensnared by iGEM, but she also has shown an incredible skillset in the electronics lab. These include the ability to communicate to electronics and defy the laws of physics. When she is not busy trying to move batteries in Phillips 228, she is often seen showing off her magnificent rowing skills for the dragon boat team.
Dylan Webster
Dylan visited our world when our universe's membrane collided with an adjacent one. A being composed of energy, but not matter, he chooses to veil himself in a human guise because he found the stares distracting. Because he exists independently of time, he experiences all of time simultaneously, and does not believe in free will. When we asked him whether he could tell us if we'll win, he simply shook his head and replied cryptically ""If you immediately know the candle light is fire, then the meal was cooked long ago"".
Robert Zhang
His memory, photographic. His vision, legendary.      On a mission to Weill Hall, he once sniped a rogue Shewanella at 400 yards.      He logged its last words, recounting all meals, behaviors, and decisions performed before the kill.
In lab he can be found crafting tools for our next challenge, working on the latest iteration of Septimus Prime. He is rumored to live a double life as a Deus Ex Aug. With a sweet pair of shades.
Faculty Advisors
Dr. Lars Angenent - Biological and Environmental Engineering
Lars Angenent is interested in converting organic materials with undefined mixed cultures, defined mixed cultures, or pure cultures of microbes to generate specific products, such as the energy carriers – methane; carboxylates; electric current; n-butanol. Pretreatment of the biomass may be necessary to increase the conversion rates, and therefore Lars Angenent is also interested in physical/chemical (e.g., dilute acid method), thermochemical (e.g., slow pyrolysis), and biological pretreatment steps. In regards to bioprocessing steps, Lars Angenent studies anaerobic digestion, anaerobic fermentation, bioelectrochemical systems, syngas fermentation, and ABE fermentation. Other areas of interest are biosensors and biocomputing devices that are based on bioelectrochemical systems (BESs); and photobioreactors.
For organic waste conversion into bioenergy, Lars Angenent is promoting the carboxylate platform as an important platform in biorefineries because water and nutrients must be recycled while bioenergy yields must be maximized. This platform is based on microbial conversions with undefined mixed cultures that can handle the complexity and variability of organic wastes. Therefore, Lars Angenent is interested in the microbial community dynamics in engineered systems. For this reason, his lab utilizes second-generation sequencing platforms in combination with powerful bioinformatic tools and ecology theory.
Dr. Shivaun Archer - Biomedical Engineering
Dr. Shivaun Archer is a Senior Lecturer in charge of the Biomedical Engineering Undergraduate Instructional Laboratories. She designs and teaches undergraduate instructional labs for five biomedical engineering courses: BME 131, BME 301, BME 302, BME 401, and BME 402. The labs are designed to illustrate the course material and bring research to undergraduate education whilst exposing students to cutting edge technology and research methodology. A significant emphasis in all the labs is biomedical nanotechnology. Each of the five courses has a hands-on lab module that focuses specifically on nanobiotechnology. Overall, the lab modules enhance the hands-on training of Cornell students in the areas of microfabrication, microfluidics, biosensors, nano/microbiotechnology, and drug delivery. In recognition of her efforts in undergraduate education, Dr. Archer has received a prestigious College of Engineering Teaching award.
Before coming to Cornell, Dr. Archer worked for five years at Lynntech, Inc. a small research company specializing in biotechnology, biomaterials, chemical and biological sensors, medical biotechnology, and environmental remediation. Her work on wastewater treatment for long term space missions resulted in her receiving two NASA Inventions Space Act Awards. She also holds a joint appointment as a Research Associate in the School of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering. Her research interests include nanobiotechnology and tissue engineering.
Dr. Matthew DeLisa - Chemical Engineering
Matthew DeLisa received his B.S. in Chemical Engineering from the University of Connecticut in 1996; his Ph.D. in Chemical Engineering from the University of Maryland in 2001; and did postdoctoral work at the University of Texas-Austin, Department of Chemical Engineering. DeLisa joined the Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering at Cornell University as an assistant professor in 2003 and was promoted to associate professor in 2009. He recently served as a Gastprofessur at ETH Zürich in the Institut für Mikrobiologie.
Professor DeLisa's research focuses on understanding and controlling the molecular mechanisms underlying protein biogenesis -- folding and assembly, membrane translocation and post-translational modifications -- in the complex environment of a living cell. His contributions to science and engineering include the invention of numerous commercially important technologies for facilitating the discovery, design and manufacturing of human drugs and seminal discoveries in the areas of cellular protein folding and protein translocation. DeLisa has received several awards for his work including an NSF CAREER award, a NYSTAR Watson Young Investigator award, a Beckman Foundation Young Investigator award, an Office of Naval Research Young Investigator award, and a NYSTAR Distinguished Faculty Award. He was also named one of the top 35 young innovators (TR35) by MIT's Technology Review in 2005 and was selected as the inaugural recipient of the Wiley-Blackwell Biotechnology and Bioengineering Daniel I.C. Wang award, which honors a distinguished young researcher in this field. Most recently, he was honored with a Cornell Provost's Award for Distinguished Scholarship and was the recipient of the Young Investigator Award from the American Chemical Society's BIOT division.
Dr. Jeff Gralnick - Microbiology, University of Minnesota
Jeffrey Gralnick has extensively studied the physiology of Shewanella, a species of gram-negative bacteria found throughout the world in aquatic environments. By understanding the molecular mechanism that enables this species to respire a diversity of compounds - including insoluble minerals - he hopes to engineer strains that can generate power in microbial fuel cells or react against certain toxic metals in the environment.
Working in collaboration with Prof. Daniel Bond, Gralnick made a key discovery about how bacteria can convert organic compounds into electricity. It was observed that riboflavin (commonly known as vitamin B-2) was responsible for much of the energy produced by Shewanella bacteria growing on electrodes. Riboflavin produced by the bacteria was able to carry electrons from the living cells to the electrodes, and rates of electricity production increased by 370 percent as riboflavin accumulated. This finding has major implications for the development of scaled-up microbial fuel cells using similar bacteria.
Gralnick is developing strains, tools and techniques for increasing the robustness of using Shewanella for metabolic engineering and downstream applications in both Bioenergy (microbial fuel cells), Bioremediation and Biocatalysis.
Dr. Xiling Shen - Electrical and Computer Engineering
Dr. Xiling Shen has been an assistant professor in the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Cornell University since August 2009.
Born in Shanghai, China, Dr. Xiling Shen went on to receive his BS and MS degree from the Electrical Engineering Department of Stanford University in 2001. He then worked at Barcelona Design Inc. for two years, specializing in analog circuit design and optimization, before joining Professor Mark Horowtiz' research group in the Electrical Engineering Department at Stanford in 2003. In the first two years of his PhD, he collaborated with Professor Joseph Kahn on using adaptive spatial equalization to compensate modal dispersion in multimode fibers. From 2005 to 2008, he worked with Professor Harley McAdams, Professor Lucy Shapiro, and Professor David Dill on modeling and analyzing the asymmetric division of Caulobacter crescentus. Xiling’s postdoctoral work focused on synthetic biology with Dr. Adam Arkin in Bioengineering at UC Berkeley prior to joining the faculty at Cornell University’s School of Electrical and Computer Engineering.

Our Team
The Penn iGEM 2012 Team consists of 4 undergraduates, 3 advisors, and many others who have provided important contributions along the way. Together, we have learned a lot over the last few months. We have taught ourselves different protocols and developed new standards to synchronize our work. Through our participation in iGEM, we have collaborated to learn more about synthetic biology - from the initial days of cloning constructs to the final days of imaging and analysis. Our idea for spatio-temporal control of drug delivery first originated in late May after weeks of reading papers. Slowly we have been able to piece together different components of the system to help the project materialize to the system it is today. We believe our work in optogenetics and drug delivery has a promising future and we are excited to share our results at the World Championships!

Sanghoon Han : Team Leader
Hi, I'm Sanghoon Han(or you can call me Richard if you want) and I somehow became team leader. :O Whatever.. I'm a junior double majoring in Biotechnology and Business management at Korea University. This is my second year in iGEM competition. I mainly deal with wiki page coding, human practice activities and laboratory works.
Jeong Min Lee
Hello my name is Jeong Min Lee and I am majoring in division of life science in Korea University. I am junior here and this is my first time participating in igem.

Undergraduates
Akshay Sethi: Biochemistry & Molecular Biology
Hey guys, my name is Akshay Sethi and I am a sophomore majoring in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology. This is my first year participating in iGEM and I have since taken a great interest into synthetic biology and its importance in the near future. I aspire to attend medical school, and to furthermore pursue a career in medicine or health care management. When I am not working in lab, I enjoy volunteering at a student-run clinic for the underserved and also staying active through tennis and basketball.
Christine Olson: Neurobiology, Physiology & Behavior
I am a fourth year neurobiology, physiology, and behavior major and I love everything I have learned here on our iGEM team. It's been such an awesome experience from every angle. I am a Training Coordinator at The House, which is a peer counseling center on campus. In my free time, I love biking out to huge fields of sunflowers, listening to music, and taking pictures. After college, I plan on perhaps going to graduate school or going into teaching. Fun fact: I am an underground rapper.
Colin Deniston: Biological Sciences: Molecular & Cell Biology
I’m a fifth year Biological Sciences major at UC Davis. I joined iGEM due to my interest in learning how to manage a realistically scaled research project, as well as, to increase my knowledge of in lab protocol and technique. On the iGEM team I work on the protein engineering and mutant creation/screening protocols. I hope to continue on to graduate school and eventually become a professor.  On my free time I’m an avid video game enthusiast of all game types. I also enjoy reading books, manga, and spending time with friends.
Deborah Park: Biological Sciences
I'm a fourth year and I love brains! I love all things related to science, but neurobiology is something I would love to study more after graduation! I like to draw, play the violin, stargaze, and listen to some music! I love animals, so I like to help out at a ranch to take care of horses and dogs! I also like exclamation points!!!
Mattan Hamou: Neurobiology, Physiology & Behavior
I am an undergraduate student at the University of California, Davis. As an undeclared Life Science major at UC Davis I am currently exploring all the opportunities available to me in the college of biological sciences. I am currently debating between cell biology and neurobiology, physiology and behavior. Through my Emergency Medical Technician training, I obtained a stronger sense of what life in the emergency medical world entails. After learning on a deeper level the value of genetic engineering this past year I wanted to shift to the laboratory spectrum of the medical field. My intention in joining iGEM was to research possible solutions to medical problems which would allow me to combine both of my aspirations of research in a practical medical field. My main interests in research are in cell functions and how they interact with one another, particularly in immunology and oncology, biomedical devices, and bioremediation. As treasurer of The Triple Helix, Outreach Assembly member, Garamendi for Congress volunteer, and brother of AEPi I am an active member of the UC Davis student body. In my spare time I play the saxophone, video games, sports, and watch a lot of movies. My favorite superhero is Batman :).
Nick Csicsery: Biological Systems Engineering
Hi, I'm Nick Csicsery, a senior studying biological systems engineering at UC Davis. This is my second year doing iGEM and I'm very excited to complete another project! I'm interested in all things engineering and in learning more about synthetic biology. When I'm not in lab or studying for classes, I'm usually busy organizing events as the president of the Biomedical Engineering Society at Davis. Otherwise, I like spending my time playing guitar or running long distances.
Pui Yan Ho: Biotechnology: Microbiology & Fermentation
Hello everyone, I’m Pui Yan! My ambition is to pursue a career in the biomedical field after completing my undergraduate studies. In the future, I plan to continue onto graduate school and become a college professor. In my spare time, I like to play piano and discover new restaurants to try. I would say that I’m a big fan of dessert and tapioca drinks, so I eat something sweet everyday all day!
Sahar Hojjat: Biological Sciences: Molecular & Cell Biology
Hi! My name is Sahar and I am a senior at UC Davis. My major is Biological Sciences with an emphasis in Molecular and Cell Biology. I am pursuing to be a doctor, but I am also fascinated by the field of synthetic biology and so I want to do more research in the field as well. If I'm not studying, some of my favorite hobbies are dancing, yoga, and meditation.
Sergio Waqued: Biomedical Engineering
Hello and good day, I'm Sergio Castro Waqued fourth year Biomedical Engineering student. I'm the team's renaissance man and resident troubleshooter. I enjoy transmuting ideas into a physical form and working on electronics. I love to listen to blues and classic rock, as well as read horror and mystery novels. In the future hope to continue on with more research, possibly in the field of imaging and devices.
Spencer Wong: Genetics & Economics
Hello! I’m Spencer, a junior studying both Economics and Genetics. I love baking and chocolate cakes are my favorite. Food is amazing to me, and I think I should have been a Food Science major sometimes. I love learning about genetic manipulations, such as making things glow in the dark! I play volleyball, listen to Shwayze, and watch Teen Wolf. I’m a bobaholic, true story. I get tapioca (boba) at least once a week. After graduation, I hope to work at a biotechnology firm and then attend graduate school.

Team:UC Davis/Team wip
From 2012.igem.org
The Team
The undergraduate portion of the IGEM 2011 team at UC Davis is currently comprised of four UC Davis students, two of whom are carried over from the team that brought home a Gold at the iGEM Jamboree last year. Candidates for this years iGEM team were selected based on their academic achievement, previous work and laboratory experience, interviews with faculty and responses to a questionnaire about iGEM and synthetic biology.
Keegan Owsley
Major: Biomedical Engineering.
Year: Senior.
iGEM Experience: 2 years.
Specialty: Team leader. Code-guy.
Musical Expertise: None.
Autobiography: Hello! This is my second year being on an iGEM team, and it feels good to be back. We hit the ground running fast this year, and we've gotten a lot done - but the science never stops! Working on iGEM has been an excellent opportunity as an undergrad to participate in self-driven research. As other igemmers probably understand, I spend most of my ""free"" time in lab - but on the off chance I'm not there, you can often find me online, playing Minecraft, surfing reddit, and hanging out with friends!
Tim Fenton
Major: Cell Biology.
Year: Senior.
iGEM Experience: 3 years.
Specialty: Photo-guy. Wiki Designer.
Musical Expertise: 17 years of piano, plays about a dozen other instruments.
Autobiography: Hey there I'm Tim.  I really enjoy doing iGEM because it is one of the best undergrad research opportunities and I love working in the field of synthetic biology.  If I'm not working in lab (almost never) I enjoy cycling on the country roads around Davis and playing tennis.
Aaron Heuckroth
Major: Microbiology, Classics.
Year: Senior.
iGEM Experience: 1 year.
Speciality: Bacteria Geek, Fundraiser/PR Guy.
Musical Expertise: 7 years of electric guitar. Metal, prog-rock, whatever!
Autobiography: I started this summer feeling like the odd man out -- before iGEM, I had no experience with any kind of engineering, and I was the only member of the team not to have taken advanced math courses. My focus on microbiology ended up coming in handy more than once, and I've picked up a lot from my team members, Marc, and the other members of the Facciotti lab, and I plan to explore the field of synthetic biology further in graduate school. If I had free time left over from both majors, I would spend it playing guitar, cooking delicious food and toying around with the occasional video game.
Nick Csicsery
Major: Biological Systems Engineering.
Year: Junior.
iGEM Experience: 1 year.
Speciality: Wetlab Powerhouse, ""The New Guy.""
Musical Expertise: Several years of electric guitar. Classic Rock.
Autobiography: Hi I'm Nick. iGEM this year has been my first lab experience and I have really enjoyed learning how to work in a research lab. I've learned quite a bit about how a project can be taken from an initial idea to a finished product. I've been most amazed by seeing how much a small group of people can get done when they all diligently work together. In my spare time I like long distance running and hiking.
