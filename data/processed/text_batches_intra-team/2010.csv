ChoaChoa's Delivery Service is composed of 5 undergraduate wetlab students, 2 undergraduate computational students, 2 graduate student advisors, 2 faculty advisors, and administrative support.
Our wetlab group of Christoph Neyer, Amy Kristofferson, Daniela Mehech, Conor McClune, and Tahoura Samad built the Choano payload delivery devices, transposase devices, developed and performed all assays associated with this project. Ben Bubenheim and Bing Xia built the infrastructure for Clotho's API, wrote the Datum layer, worked out the Netbeans and Hibernate platforms, the Biosafety framework, and several Apps including Sequence Checker, BBAligner, StringAppend Algorithm, and Groovy Scripter. Tim Hsiau was the ringleader of the iGEM team providing training, advise, technical and moral support. Jin Huh provided parts derived from his mammalian payload delivery project which yielded many of the basic parts used in the project in addition to parts used from Berkeley iGEM 2008. Chris Anderson and Terry Johnson provided lab space, reagents, consumables, moral support, graphics, guidance, and training to the team.   Chris Anderson wrote many of the Apps not mentioned here included within the distributed version of Clotho.  The specific architecture of the Clotho API was determined through many conversations between Ben, Bing, Josh Kittleson, Douglas Densmore, Tim Ham, and Michal Galdzicki.  The new clothocad.org website was provided with support by Autodesk with advice from Carlos Olguin and made by a professional firm, Noble Studios. The UC Berkeley iGEM is selected by the Berkeley iGEM Advising Group composed of Adam Arkin, Jay Keasling, Chris Anderson, Terry Johnson, and Susan Marqusee.  We are blessed to receive administrative support from Kate Spohr.

The history of higher education in Debrecen goes back to the 16th century. The city established the Calvinist College of Debrecen in 1538. The College became soon the most important cultural center of the whole country, where a great number of writers, scientists and politicians received their education.
In the 18th century the schools of Law and Theology were founded and although no separate School  of Medicine existed, physicians were also trained in the College. Today's University  Medical School is rooted in this spiritual heritage. The present day Debrecen is also famous for its schools and higher educational establishments. The Medical School of the University of Debrecen is Central  Europe's first campus medical school. It was in the year of the millennium (1896) of Hungary's foundation when the establishment of a modern University was decided upon in Debrecen. The University was officially inaugurated on October 23, 1918 and at that time consisted of four faculties: Arts, Science, Theology and Medicine. The Faculty of Medicine became an independent  University Medical School under the supervision of the Ministry of Health in 1951.
 
The Medical School has 22 departments of basic sciences and 25 clinical departments specializing in various fields e.g. clinical chemistry, internal medicine, surgery, orthopedics, radiology, neurology, neurosurgery, psychiatry, pediatrics, obstetrics and
gynecology, cardiology and pulmonology, oto-rhino-laryngology, dermatology, ophthalmology, stomatology and urology. The Medical School serves as the city hospital for Debrecen therefore students of upper terms may also obtain their clinical training here.
Education at Debrecen Medical School is accredited by the World Health Organization, US Department of Education, The State Education Department (NY, USA), Medical Board of California  , the General Medicine Council (UK - PLAB exam is compulsory), Medical Councils of Israel, Ireland, Iran and Norway. In most European countries - not listed above - and also in India the diploma of the University of Debrecen, Medical and Health Science  Center is accepted for registration purposes; however a qualifying exam is compulsory.
Debrecen is one of the most vivid and coziest nooks in Hungary: this city is a unique and outstanding whirlpool of a dynamic cultural and intellectual heritage and of an effective and successful economic life. The centuries’ old traditions and the most recent technical and scientific innovations enhancing each other make Debrecen a nationally and internationally renowned city.
This lively city in the heart of the Carpathian Basin awaits the visitors with a cornucopia of programs and events, from a number of excellent art exhibitions, folk programs to many sports and leisure events. The outstanding collections of the local museums, the historical monuments of the city or the various and imposing programs of local folk traditions enchant all visitors who wish to explore the marvels of Debrecen: choir festivals, folk festivals, carnivals, breath-taking exhibitions, fairs offer their programs and goods for the visitors. At the same time Debrecen, which is a university centre, is also a place for conferences and scientific meetings, and this serves the active and organic cooperation of the city’s economic, scientific, educational and cultural life.
This culturally and scientifically active life is combined with a splendid leisure and wellness sphere as well: the recently renovated Mediterranean Aqua Park and the charming Zoo in the centre of the romantic Great Forest offer excellent time for the whole family, while the Aquaticum Wellness and Spa Resort designs exclusive health treatments and wellness care programmes for the visitors as Debrecen is one of the largest centres of mineral thermal water in Europe. This leisure life is enriched by the active sport life of the city: Debrecen has been hosting a number of national and international sports events from national championships to European and World championships. For the lovers of rural country life the Erdőspuszta territories and Hortobágy is a must to visit, because the calm and enchanting atmosphere is an excellent basis for relaxation, while those who seek pleasures in fishing, hunting and riding may also enjoy the region.
Thus, this city in the eastern periphery of the country is an unparalleled place – not only because of the flourishing cultural, scientific and social life but because of the dynamic economic and industrial traditions as well, which has established an outstanding and marvellous atmosphere in Debrecen.

Fellow iGEM team, here is a summary of our last team meeting (30.6.10, 14:00):
1.   The following member attended the meeting: Kata S. Kata N, Timi B, Shun CL. Endre K, Ophir K, Lilla O and Balint LB.  The meeting took place from 14:00 to 15:00.
 
2. We discussed the following administrative issues (AKA agenda’s):
Feedback about working habits:
Notebooks- TDK student do not use their notebooks as       often as they should. This causes a problem in information flow,
End of the day- Students should make it a habit to       inform their team correspondent of their day’s work and it’s progression       before leaving for the day.
Meetings- The meeting delegate (lior) and the schedule       coordinator (ophir) will arrive at team meetings earlier (20 min) in aim       of better meeting organization.
Today’s work to be done was discussed (see action      items)            
Subteam’s students will have to undertake individual      responsibilities. This will promote each individual’s work quality. This      item will be expanded in the next end of week meeting. Eg. Timi from the      cloning team will be responsible for electrophoresis        
3. Action items:
A.    Change of working habits (end of day, notebook’s and pre- meetings) as described above should be undertaken by all of the TDK students
B.     Today’s wetlab work will be split into two teams:
I.                          The cloning team will make another electrophoresis to confirm the results of the maxi prep done on Monday (Kata N. and Timi B.) . An inoculation will be made from the biobrick transformation done yesterday (Ophir K., Dorka and Lior M).
II.                       The cell culturing team will do more plating, and a transfection with the plasmids isolated from the maxi prep done at the beginning of the week (Lilla, Shun, Endre, Kata S.)
III.                    A scheduale for the next week would be revealed on Friday morning on the gmail calendar, everyone should inspect it.

----------------
Dear iGEM members,
As was discussed in the last meeting, we are going to prepare an article for the newspaper ('Medicus Lap'), and to progress with the Wiki webpage.
For this, it is essential to take an image of all the group together and some images separately, (if one has own image he/she would like to submit it is possible).
e.       Lior – publishing a summary.- here it is!
f.       Balint – Writing a web based questionnaire regarding each individual willingness and work boundaries, writing a meeting summary document format. A third questionnaire about who wants to attend the spring workshop. I merged all the question in the following questionaire: http://t7.hu/c8a
g.      Everyone- Answering the format.

Our team comprises of a mosaic of cultures and academic backgrounds. Out of twelve university students a broad range of disciplinarians may be found: five molecular biology master students, six students of the medicine faculty and one student of the medical research laboratory field. Culturally speaking, we have representatives from Hungary, Israel and Taiwan (three different continents).  Beyond plain laboratory work we got a feel of each cultures work, fun and life definitions. We view our diversity as the pinnacle of our advantage. Click here to read about the different team members

The Nuclear Receptor Research lab, led by Laszlo Nagy, focuses on the molecular and cell biology of lipid activated transcription factors, so called nuclear receptors.  We are interested in the molecular details of hormone action. Lipid soluble hormones such as oestrogens and retinoids act via these receptors that bind to and regulate the expression of certain genes. The aim of the ten PhD students, four postdocs and senior researchers, associated with several undergraduate students is to understand the details and molecular determinants of these interactions using molecular and cell biological approaches.
 
To do so, we target our questions from different aspects, applying high variety of techniques, including basic RNA and protein biology, advanced microscopy, animal models, microarray techniques and bioinformatics.
The Genomics Center is a core facility and research laboratory, a unit of the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology (University of Debrecen Medical and Health Science Center). It has been established to support the University of Debrecen scientific community, as well as other academic research teams interested in using high-throughput genomics and bioinformatics for their research projects. We put special emphasis on supporting clinical genomics projects investigating the pathomechanism of diseases or searching for novel drug targets.
  
 
The history of higher education in Debrecen goes back to the 16th century. The city established the Calvinist College of Debrecen in 1538. The College became soon the most important cultural center of the whole country, where a great number of writers, scientists and politicians received their education.
In the 18th century the schools of Law and Theology were founded and although no separate School  of Medicine existed, physicians were also trained in the College. Today's University  Medical School is rooted in this spiritual heritage. The present day Debrecen is also famous for its schools and higher educational establishments. The Medical School of the University of Debrecen is Central  Europe's first campus medical school. It was in the year of the millennium (1896) of Hungary's foundation when the establishment of a modern University was decided upon in Debrecen. The University was officially inaugurated on October 23, 1918 and at that time consisted of four faculties: Arts, Science, Theology and Medicine. The Faculty of Medicine became an independent  University Medical School under the supervision of the Ministry of Health in 1951.
 
The Medical School has 22 departments of basic sciences and 25 clinical departments specializing in various fields e.g. clinical chemistry, internal medicine, surgery, orthopedics, radiology, neurology, neurosurgery, psychiatry, pediatrics, obstetrics and
gynecology, cardiology and pulmonology, oto-rhino-laryngology, dermatology, ophthalmology, stomatology and urology. The Medical School serves as the city hospital for Debrecen therefore students of upper terms may also obtain their clinical training here.
Education at Debrecen Medical School is accredited by the World Health Organization, US Department of Education, The State Education Department (NY, USA), Medical Board of California  , the General Medicine Council (UK - PLAB exam is compulsory), Medical Councils of Israel, Ireland, Iran and Norway. In most European countries - not listed above - and also in India the diploma of the University of Debrecen, Medical and Health Science  Center is accepted for registration purposes; however a qualifying exam is compulsory.
Debrecen is one of the most vivid and coziest nooks in Hungary: this city is a unique and outstanding whirlpool of a dynamic cultural and intellectual heritage and of an effective and successful economic life. The centuries’ old traditions and the most recent technical and scientific innovations enhancing each other make Debrecen a nationally and internationally renowned city.
This lively city in the heart of the Carpathian Basin awaits the visitors with a cornucopia of programs and events, from a number of excellent art exhibitions, folk programs to many sports and leisure events. The outstanding collections of the local museums, the historical monuments of the city or the various and imposing programs of local folk traditions enchant all visitors who wish to explore the marvels of Debrecen: choir festivals, folk festivals, carnivals, breath-taking exhibitions, fairs offer their programs and goods for the visitors. At the same time Debrecen, which is a university centre, is also a place for conferences and scientific meetings, and this serves the active and organic cooperation of the city’s economic, scientific, educational and cultural life.
This culturally and scientifically active life is combined with a splendid leisure and wellness sphere as well: the recently renovated Mediterranean Aqua Park and the charming Zoo in the centre of the romantic Great Forest offer excellent time for the whole family, while the Aquaticum Wellness and Spa Resort designs exclusive health treatments and wellness care programmes for the visitors as Debrecen is one of the largest centres of mineral thermal water in Europe. This leisure life is enriched by the active sport life of the city: Debrecen has been hosting a number of national and international sports events from national championships to European and World championships. For the lovers of rural country life the Erdőspuszta territories and Hortobágy is a must to visit, because the calm and enchanting atmosphere is an excellent basis for relaxation, while those who seek pleasures in fishing, hunting and riding may also enjoy the region.
Thus, this city in the eastern periphery of the country is an unparalleled place – not only because of the flourishing cultural, scientific and social life but because of the dynamic economic and industrial traditions as well, which has established an outstanding and marvellous atmosphere in Debrecen.
The well-known Hungarian 3d puzzle known as Rubik’s cube celebrates its 30th anniversary this year. It was designed   in 1974 by Hungarian sculptor and professor of architecture Ernő Rubik. As of January 2009, 350 million cubes have sold world wide making it the world's top-selling puzzle game.The mathematical permutations of the cube are astonishing, the cube is said to house 43,252,003,274,489,856,000 possibilities (approximately forty-three quintillion). Grass roots society’s exist solely for the mastering of this unique puzzle.
We chose the cube as our logo for several reasons. Aside from being a Hungarian pride, we saw the cube as a metaphor for synthetic biology. At the heart of the game is synthetic design, which allows users to alter it’s predefined shape in order to achieve a unique and colorful three dimensional structure. Our team is coloful mixture of scientific disciplinaries and nationalities, we thought this is portrayed by the cube as well. Click here to see contemprary forms of the Cube .

In memoriam
Ethan Johnson
Ethan T. Johnson
9-22-1972 to 9-21-2010
Ethan, our dear friend, colleague and teacher, died on September 21st 2010 due to injuries suffered in a hit-and-run car accident. We are shocked and devastated by our loss. Ethan joined the Schmidt-Dannert lab in 2005, and was the go-to guy for all our questions, scientific and otherwise. He nurtured the talents of us all, and made us better scientists.
As undergraduates working on the iGEM project in Claudia’s lab, we feel blessed to call Ethan Johnson a friend and mentor.  We could not have asked for more in a teacher:  he was a knowledgeable guide at times when we felt we were blundering and lost.  He always gave a thoughtful pause before answering our questions.   When we were feeling foolish, struggling to understand a new concept or experimental technique, Ethan was always considerate and helpful.   In addition to being a great experimenter, Ethan was involved in the Minneapolis arts and outdoor activities communities.  As undergraduates, we looked up to him for his ability to balance his scientific accomplishments and diverse interests.  We feel that working with and getting to know Ethan has shown all of us on the iGEM team how to be better scientists and members of a community.
A web-site has been built to honor and remember our friend: ethantjohnson.com

Our lab
Located 5 minutes walk from the Luxembourg Gardens at the Paris Descartes Medicine Faculty in Cochin, the Centre for Research and Interdisciplinarity CRI was founded in 2005 as a convivial place at the crossroad between Life Sciences and exact, natural, cognitive and social sciences. Our environment includes a fully-equipped seminar room, a meeting room, office space for visiting professors, a library and coffee rooms and a modelling as well as wet-lab space. The CRI supported its students over three years ago to form the first French team to the iGEM and the tradition is continuing... This is where all happened!
Our Student Team
Hi! This is our iGEM team. We are 8 undergrad students from different disciplines who have worked together over this summer to design, build and test the counting bacteria. We also had great instructors and supervisors who helped us a lot with their advise and experience. It was a great group work experience, we've learned a lot and also had fun! Everyone had a chance to work on all parts of the project, but we divided the responsibilities for different aspects among our team members.

Now this is the story all about how my skills got flipped turned upside down
And I’d like to take a minute.
Just sit right there.
I’ll tell you how I became technician of a lab called St A.
In east aalen, Stadtkreis, my cultures were raised.
On the thermo cycler is where I spend most of my days.
restrictin’, incubatin, ligating, all cool and all.
shootin’ some plasmids outside of the plan.
when a couple of Docs who were up to no good started makin’ soup in my eppendorf.
I got one little colony and the boss got scared.
And said, “You’re movin’ with your auntie and uncle in Bel Air"".
Alasdair Morton
I like ordinary differential equation, but I am in fact exceptional. I breathe stochastically and I eat rate constants for breakfast, also green berets.  As a physicist I am disappointed that we are not making BioBricks out of the individual protons, neutrons and electrons. They would work much better as standard parts and can easily be captured from the wild without PCR. New parts could be generated automatically by colliding technical and legal standards at Cern, I will therefore be known to as the Collider in Chief.
Patrick Olden
My love is like a red red rose that newly springs in June, if you don’t see that is an illusion to the modelling of quorum sensing then there is no hope for you. Because we all know that it springs at 0.008 arbitrary units per mouse intestine on up regulation and at a somewhat smaller but quantitatively unknown value on down regulation. That is enough about me since I must now leave to play that funky music. Peace out.
David Owen
I am a cell biologist with a focus on neuroscience. I was attracted to the interdisciplinary nature of iGem and also by the opportunity to do novel research in a fairly independent manner. In my opinion I bring: a general understanding of lab procedure; a try anything once attitude and an appreciation of malt whisky to the team. I am hoping that this project will lead to me being more skilled and comfortable in the lab, it will also provide me with exposure to an area of science that would have been unavailable otherwise.

Sarah Shapiro
Teh Sarah is teh b0mb. Teh Sarah is teh statmaster, which is like a stairmaster but does not provide a calf work out. It does however provide a mind work out. Teh iGem crew has a wikid strong mind, cos i am all up in their statistical grills questionairing their preconcieved ideas.
James Taylor
I am a chemist from Lancaster. The opportunity to join this iGem team is the reason I chose to study at St Andrews. You may not think that this is interesting but St Andrews did not have an iGem team when I applied, therefore extraordinary prescience on my part was required. I use this talent to determine whether or not experiments will be successful before they have even taken place, this allows huge savings to be made on lab materials. I also know the final results of the competition but am keeping them secret for betting purposes.
Jonathan Ward
My name is Jaunty and I am the jauntiest person in the world. Sometimes people ask me how I can be so jaunty and I tell them that it is a gift. It can not be learned or shared. You either have it or you don’t. However, other people can bask in my reflected self confident air and buoyant personality which leads to massive productivity gains. It is for this reason that I am on the St Andrews iGEM team and it is why someday, I will be king.

I am hoping that this project will lead to me being more skilled and comfortable in the lab, it will also provide me with exposure to an area of science that would have been unavailable otherwise.
Fatemeh Salimi
I am a first year medical student with a passion for research. I entered medicine from the other side of the science spectrum, with a background in engineering. I was always involved in mathematics and physics field at high school. The interdisciplinary character of iGEM fascinated me. Being involved in the first iGEM team of St Andrews University was challenging and an excellent learning experience. iGEM was first experience analyzing papers and planning biological experiments and it was very rewarding for me. Last but not least, I like playing water polo,  archery and travelling.
Sarah Shapiro
I am a fourth year Biologist and hope to bring to the team my fun filled knowlege of all things Biology. My main hope is that iGEM will give me the oppertunity to spend more time in the lab and become more experienced in lab procedures and techniques.
James Taylor
I’m a second year chemistry student who gets enthusiastic about good spectra, chelation and names of organic molecules. Getting to contribute this to an interdisciplinary project this summer is a definite win. On getting used to working in the biology lab, I began to express myself through the miniprep and nanodrop dance. Aside from general enthusiasm for science, technology and the community of innovation, I enjoy kayaking, playing the guitar, barbeques and real ale.
Jonathan Ward
I'm a final year Computer Scientist and am looking foward to working in a new field and gaining hands on research experience. As a CS student I feel it is easy to become distanced from thinking and working like a scientist. Through iGEM I hope I can get involved in 'hard' science and apply my CS background in a new way.

Davidson & Missouri Western 2010 iGEM team
       Our team is an interdisciplinary group composed of biology and mathematics subgroups collaborating between two different campuses, Missouri Western State University (MWSU) in St. Joseph, MO and Davidson College in Davidson, NC. Davidson and MWSU are 1,032 miles/1,660 km apart, so our collaboration involves cyber meetings, wiki postings, Wiggio shared space, Skype communication, and two campus site-visits.
       During the first week of our 10 week project, Davidson students traveled to the Missouri Western campus for 5 days to determine what our project would be. During week 10, Missouri Western students traveled to Davidson to produce the wiki, PPT and poster. Our team is composed of 15 undergraduates, as neither campus has graduate students or postdocs.  We have a variety of sophmores, juniors and seniors with majors in biology, chemistry, civil engineering, mathematics, as well as some who have not declared their majors yet.  However we all share a common interest in synthetic biology research.

Project Description
Natural killer (NK) cells of the immune system identify cancer and virally-infected cells and kill them. These potent killers travel throughout the body, recognizing proteins and other molecules on the surface of cells. In order to differentiate between healthy and diseased cells, NK cells use a variety of receptors, which bind to specific ligands at the target cells’ surface. The balance between activating and inhibitory signals will tell the NK cell if the target cell is diseased or healthy, respectively. If the target cell is deemed potentially dangerous, the NK cell grips the target cell tightly and creates an immunological synapse at the site of adhesion. Within this immunological synapse, the NK cell releases cytotoxic granules to kill the target cell without harming any nearby cells allowing for a direct, apoptotic death.
Our team will focus on improving NK cells’ specificity and killing efficiency towards certain cancer types. By using synthetic biology tools and logic gates’ design, we hope to create powerful killing biomachines for the fight against cancer. Our newly engineered synthetic devices would have the potential to enhance current adoptive cell-based immunotherapy for cancer patients.

Carmen Zhou
My name is Carmen Zhou and I will soon be entering UCSD as a freshman molecular biology major. The seeding of my interest in biotechnology began when I first observed my transformed plate of fluorescing bacteria under a black light. A silly seed, I know, but having been able to see an actual result of one of my experiments first hand was something quite thrilling. This single seed grew as my knowledge of the causes and effects of diseases expanded, which made biology seem more dynamic, disgusting, and like it was begging to be changed. I guess that is where I stand today-on an open field full of possibilities to reverse such diseases. And that is where iGEM comes in. Although I initially joined iGEM as a means to get to learn more about the techniques bioengineers use and to just get an idea of how research is conducted, I was pleased to find out that my iGEM experience was going to be one of those possibilities in the open field. The combination of health, cancer killing, new techniques, and silly mentors just surpassed my expectations and made this summer unforgettable. I can now see myself zooming through lab work with confidence and even landing a research position as an undergraduate!
Lianna Fung
I just recently graduated from Abraham Lincoln High School and am now attending UCSD. I have always been interested in science and the limitless possibilities it can yield. Biotechnology in particular caught my interest after taking a course on it in high school. It fascinated me that we had reached a point where we could modify and improve upon the biology of organisms for specific purposes. This fascination caused me to seek out more opportunities to learn and improve my experience in the field. This led me to my desire to participate in iGEM. iGEM seemed a perfect combination of what I wanted and more. It was a chance to work with others as a team in a welcoming environment. It also gave me the chance to learn new skills that I would normally not be exposed to until further down in my education. My iGEM experience was interesting. It could be tiring and frustrating at times, but it was also very fun and rewarding. iGEM also creates a sort of independence in people that isn’t as easy to find in the classroom. Overall, the iGEM experience was wonderful and well worth the long hours spent on it. As a bonus, I got to meet some very interesting people as well and make some good friends too.
Connor Grant
My name is Connor Grant and I just graduated from Abraham Lincoln High School and will be a freshman at UCSD next year. I almost didn't join iGEM because it conflicted with soccer, but in the end I decided (with some encouragement from my biotech teacher) to spend the summer in the lab at UCSF. iGEM was a great way to learn lab techniques that are used very often in company and University research all over the world. It was good to get experience working in a lab and interacting with post docs and PHD students. It was a good experience over all and I'm glad I did it.
Hannah Yan
I recently graduated from Abraham Lincoln High School of San Francisco and am attending Barnard College. For me, iGEM was a chance for me to see if I wanted get into the field of science and to do something awesome during the summer. It really has been a great experience, with its ups and downs. Despite all the failures I have encountered while doing my cloning and minipreps, the ecstatic feeling I get when something worked made everything worthwhile. During iGEM, I was able to use the skills I had learned in biotechnology class and I learned a few new ones as well. I think my experience at iGEM will help me a lot when I decide to pursue the field of science in the future. My summer has been extremely academic, but being able to work with friends and on such a great project has been a lot of fun.
John Elam
Hey, I'm John Elam from this year's UCSF iGEM team.  I was born and raised in San Francisco and am currently attending UC Davis, majoring in molecular biology and biochemistry.  I joined iGEM because I knew it would be a great chance to actually do some real lab work before college, and also because I really liked the basic idea for the project that got pitched to us in May.  As of right now a four year degree from Davis is all that I am certain about; as for medical school or graduate school, I'd certainly like to go but you never know what will happen in the future.  I played football for three years in high school but currently have no plans to play in college.  I'm looking forward to presenting at the Jamboree and hope to learn a lot while I'm there.
Crystal Liu
Hello! I'm Crystal Liu, and I am currently an undergraduate at UC Davis majoring in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology. I first heard about the UCSF iGEM team as a freshman in high school, and decided that it was an experience I really wanted to be a part of at the end of my senior year. Four years later, I made it onto the team! I definitely had one of the best summers of my life. Working in a lab really opened my eyes to the world of research and helped me understand firsthand why progress and results aren't immediate. In addition to labwork, I am extremely grateful to have met all the amazing people from the Lim Lab & CPL, as well as everyone else who contributed their impressive skills and knowledge to the 2010 UCSF iGEM team. :) On a side note, I love expensive chocolate.
Sam Zorn
Although am still a senior at Abraham Lincoln High School, I am an active participant on the iGEM team. Lab work has been my passion for the last few years of my life. When I was picked for the iGEM team, I was ecstatic. Since that day I have been committed to working as hard as I could to make our project successful.  iGEM has given me a real world career experience that has helped me decide on my academic path. The field of synthetic biology has appealed to me greatly, and this summer that I spent at iGEM has more than fulfilled my expectations. I hope that my summer here will not only help me get into college, but also help kick start my career as a bench researcher. When i'm neither working in the labs nor at school, I enjoy getting out and being active. My favorite sports are soccer, and parkour, although I also like to run track, swim, and spar in various martial arts.
International Student
Min Lin
I'm Min Lin from China; I just got my Bachelor degree in Biological Science from Peking University. This is my second year in iGEM; I'm also in Peking University iGEM 2009 team. I think I've learned a lot in iGEM, and the knowledge will be really useful to me in the future. I like our project this year, because I feel that medicine is a very promising field for synthetic biology applications, although we are still at very first steps. I've been enjoying the nice environment and weather in San Francisco during the summer. And it is really an unforgettable experience to work in iGEM in the Cell Propulsion Lab.
Super Buddies
Ryan Liang
This is my second year of iGEM and I must say that I am excited to do this for a second round! I am a student in City College of San Francisco with an intent on transferring to UC Davis. Early on I had a passion for the arts and pursued it up until high school where I was introduced to biotechnology and science as an industry. This is when I realized that science is more than just reading and memorization - it is life and the most basic fundamentals of each and every one of us. iGEM allowed me to bring forth my passion for creativity in correlation with synthetic biology. iGEM has encapsulated synthetic biology into such a fun and innovative experience that getting the opportunity to participate once again is truly a blessing.
Ethan Chan
IGEM has always been such a great opportunity for all the teams to come up with project ideas are that out of the ordinary. The idea of developing a project that has never been done before is the most exciting part for me. I believe that the work done by iGEM teams have impacted the field so much that it will only get better. I am currently working towards attaining a Biotechnology degree at City College of San Francisco. I am hoping to transfer to UC Davis afterwards. After finding out UCSF's project for the 2010 year, I knew I wanted to come back. Throughout this summer, I have learned to work with mammalian cells. Before the iGEM experience, I was only familiar with prokaryotic cells. iGEM has expanded my skills and knowledge in so many ways. All the skills that i have learned will definitely help me in the future. With all these great pharmaceuticals that are being produced, the field of synthetic biology have proven its effectiveness and its future applications. I am looking forward to being a part of this field in the near future.
Eric Wong
Good Afternoon, my name is Eric Wong and i am a graduate of Abraham Lincoln High School class of 2009.  I am current pursuing my education in CCSF hoping to transfer into the UC system with the intended major of Molecular Cell Development. I was apart of the iGem team last year and in the time span of 4 months i have learned so many various things from running Assays, Cloning, Troubleshooting and analyzing Experiments and Data. I enjoyed the experience so much so that i decided to come back this year as a mentor for this year's team. I view this and last years iGem experience as something more than just a competition, I has given me the necessary education experience to prepare me for this field of study and allow me to learn about different project from various teams.
UCSF iGEM Program
Raquel Gomes
I run the UCSF iGEM program for the last three years. I really enjoy designing all the educational components of the Program but especially the 2-week bootcamp. I love teaching and  having the iGEM students around all summer. I will miss all their craziness.
Advisors
James Onuffer
This is my second year of involvement and the second year the Cell Propulsion Lab has hosted the team. It was quite an experience to set up the program this year, especially since this is a subject area that we had not begun working on in the Cell Propulsion Lab. The immune response to cancer is a challenging topic to take on (especially coupled with synthetic biology) and required an intensive two week bootcamp to teach the students basic concepts and endogenous systems/parts that they should be aware of. We challenged the students to come up with designs for synthetic cytotoxicity logic gates and increasing the cytotoxic response. It was quite rewarding to see them propose various devices during their team challenge and to see them take charge of getting them prioritized, made , and tested. Things did not always go smoothly, after all this goes with the territory. They had to learn to be organized, think on their feet, and be problem solvers.......quite a growth opportunity that I’m sure will stay with them for the rest of their lives.
Wendell Lim
I have had a lab at UCSF for 15 years. The most rewarding thing is working with bright, open-minded young scientists and seeing them develop. Its great to see that most of the iGEM kids that we have worked with have continued to be excited about science and synthetic biology.
Buddies
Jason Park
I am a 5th year MD/PhD student in the UCSF School of Medicine and the UCSF / UC Berkeley Joint Graduate Group in Bioengineering. I'm originally from the Los Angeles area and went to college at MIT. I've been in the Cell Propulsion Lab for about two years and I am co-advised by Dr. Wendell Lim and Dr. Bruce Conklin. I became a buddy for iGEM because I thought it would be fun working with bright, motivated high school and undergraduate students for the summer and I knew I would get good experience learning to be a better mentor. (Also, I had been interested in participating in iGEM as an undergraduate at MIT but never ended up doing it!) The best thing about being part of iGEM this summer has been working with and teaching students - together going through the learning process of doing lab research with all of its ups and downs.
Chia-Yung Wu
I am a transplant from MIT, where I participated in iGEM as a graduate advisor for the MIT team in 2008 and 2009.  This summer, I joined the Lim/Cell Propulsion labs as a postdoc.  It has been a great pleasure working with the UCSF team.
Russell Gordley
I majored in Biochemistry at Swarthmore College, and performed my graduate studies with Carlos Barbas at the Scripps Research Institute in La Jolla, CA. I am interested in using synthetic biology to understand and enhance the evolvability of biological systems.
After my freshman year in college, I took a summer internship with Jim Stivers at the National Institute of Standards and Technology. The practice of research turned out to be far more complex and interesting than I could have imagined--an intellectual marathon whose path is revealed with each new data set and disproven hypothesis. I am happy to participate in a program that immerses high school students in the research process.  For anyone interested in a life of science, this is a great time to join the pursuit!
Jesse Zalatan
I got started in science research with a summer internship after my junior year in high school and I was hooked! I majored in Biochemical Sciences at Harvard and went on to get my Ph.D. in Chemistry at Stanford, where I studied how enzymes speed up chemical reactions that are otherwise incredibly slow. My current research at UCSF is focused on cell signaling, where enzymes play an important role. I am trying to understand how signaling enzymes maintain specificity for the correct targets and avoid signaling mixups. Being introduced to science research in high school inspired me to pursue science in college and beyond, and I got involved with the iGEM team to help share that experience with new students.
Wilson Wong
My name is Wilson Wong and I am a postdoc at Wendell Lim's lab.  I got my undergraduate degree in chemical engineering at UC Berkeley and graduate degree in chemical engineering at UCLA.  I am currently working on applying synthetic biology to rewire human T-cell receptor signaling dynamics.  I am interested in helping iGEM because I have always enjoy teaching and mentoring.  My iGEM experience has been great.  I am very happy with the progress they've made so far and I have a wonderful time working with them.
Krista McNally
I am an Associate Specialist at UCSF and handle the Tissue Culture needs for the Cell Propulsion Laboratory. Before coming to UCSF, I was a Research Associate at a Medical Device company performing immunohistochemisty, histology, and thermal imaging. This is the first time I’ve encountered the iGEM program, and it was a great experience to see these young people work so hard as a team to accomplish a meaningful project. During the course of the summer, I gave a lecture to the Team on Tissue Culture and relevant Biosafety concerns, trained some of the students individually to do tissue culture work, and assisted with their use of the Flow Cytometer. I was really impressed with their commitment and diligence during the summer, and enjoyed having so many upbeat and energetic people in the lab.
Silinda Neou
I majored in Biochemistry from Cal State East Bay and now work at UCSF in the Cell Propulsion Lab.  I love scientific research and have been chasing a career in research ever since my first internship at a microbiology lab.  This summer I got the pleasure of interacting with the iGEM students and watching their overall scientific development.  They are a great bunch of kids.

Samantha Liang
I’m currently a second-year graduate student at UCSF in the Biochemistry and Molecular Biology Program, where I am a member of Zev Gartner’s lab.  My research involves using chemical techniques to make protein therapeutics more specific and effective. During my undergrad, I majored in Bioengineering at UC Berkeley and worked in Chris Anderson’s lab for 3 years.  At Berkeley, I was on the iGEM team in 2006 and loved it so much that I joined again in 2007.  I think that iGEM is a unique opportunity for students to conduct research in a fun team context, and also gives them to skills to perform research independently in the future.  Because of this, I wanted to stay involved in iGEM during grad school, and that’s why I’m a buddy for the awesome UCSF team this year!

Roles of people involved in making the IGEM experience the funnest summer ever!!! ....  well almost
Advisors - Advised us on project feasibility and best ideas worth pursuing.
Buddies - Postdocs and graduate students that took some time during the summer to teach us techniques and to help us trouble shoot.
Instructors - Postdocs and graduate students that taught us seminars during bootcamp.
Supper Buddies - Veteran students that were part of the UCSF iGEM 2009 team. We came back to UCSF in February to start setting up everything for the new students. We go to college at San Francisco City College.
Students - Cloning Gods. At the end of the summer we discovered the Qiagen robot - if we only knew about it earlier we could have cloned everything there is to be cloned.
International Student - Min Lin is from Peking University and he pretty much knows how to do almost everything, like a true ninja master.
Raquel Gomes - Directs the UCSF iGEM program. We first met her when she came to taught us about basic principles of immunology and synthetic biology in the after school sessions at Lincoln High school during the Spring. She is in charge of our iGEM education. She loves giving us assignments.
James Onuffer - He knows everything and also runs the CPL lab! Any question we might ask he will give us an answer way bigger than we expected. :) When things would not work out he would help us find a solution or send us the right way - when the killing assays did not work he helped us figure out what other assays we could possibly use.
Project design and Labs that contributed to our project
This summer our project was organized around engineering immune cells with enhanced anti-cancer activity: engineered cancer killer cells (natural killer (NK) cells and cytotoxic T-cells (CTL)). Our host lab was the Cell Propulsion Lab (CPL) which is an NIH-funded nanomedicine development center at UCSF /UC Berkeley. The CPL is using synthetic biology to engineer mammalian cell signaling. It has primarily been interested in synthetic scaffolds and feedback  loops to enhance and control cell signaling and studying the modularity of chemotaxis mechanisms. For this year’s iGEM team sponsorship, the CPL was interested in having us explore and work on cell mediated cytotoxicity, which is a subject area that they had not begun working on. We needed to obtain new cell lines and gene constructs from collaborators for our project as they were not already available in the lab. Additionally we needed to establish gene transfection techniques and killing assays. We obtained several natural killer cell lines from Lewis Lanier’s lab at UCSF. We also obtained plasmids containing single-chain antibody (scFv) constructs against the cancer antigens mesothelin and CD19 from the laboratory of Michael Milone at the University of Pennsylvania. Our host lab advised us on this early system work and also set up the Material Transfer Agreements (MTAs) for the scFv constructs as they are proprietary. How was this years project put together and accomplished? Earlier in the year, Ryan Liang and Ethan Chan from last year’s iGEM team started working in the lab to start growing the cell lines, work out plasmid transient transfections, and killing assays. This early work was planned with feedback and advice from members of the CPL lab. This way Ryan and Ethan could get a jump start on some of the basic systems of the project before the rest of us arrived in June. The summer goes fast, so the project area needs to be defined and planning is necessary so we can accomplish something in 3 months.
Once all of us arrived for the summer, the advisors and instructors arranged a two-week Bootcamp where we learned about cytotoxic cells, the immune response to cancer, principles of protein signaling modules and circuits, and synthetic biology. They also introduced to us the previously described use of scFv modules with signaling domains to direct the cytotoxic response towards cancer cells (Chimeric Antigen Receptors (CARs) as well as other receptors and signaling domains important in the cytotoxicity response.  At the end of the Bootcamp we were challenged by our advisors with two topics for a team challenge: 1.) how could we create synthetic logic gates to address different cancer vs normal cell antigen expression scenarios, and  2.) how could we create enhanced killing through the use of synthetic biology. We split into two teams and brainstormed and then we presented our designs to the entire group. From the first challenge we proposed to use combinations of activating and inhibitor modules on chimeric antigen receptors to create gates such as an ANDN (AND NOT) gate; these devices would mimic the self vs. cancer responses of natural receptors on NK cells. However our devices could be engineered to detect any cancer antigen for which an antibody could be raised. Although individual activating CARs had been reported by others, no one had used them in combination to create logic gates. For the second challenge we presented several ways to enhance cell killing by adding multiple signaling domains to one CAR receptor and also by engineering new granule components to overcome cancer resistance.
After the team challenge, the real work started. We were challenged to propose, list, and design the actual components of our devices. We generated lists and then in discussion and brainstorming with our advisors, we set a priority list for construction. We followed the same modular cloning to create our devices using the restriction enzyme AarI used by last year’s team. Advisors in the CPL ordered the clones we decided upon primarily from Open Biosystems. Once they arrived we went to work. We sequenced the clones to be sure they were correct and then we designed PCR primers for cloning and were in charge of all aspects of device construction and analysis. During the construction of the initial  CAR devices, we came up with the idea of sending GFP to the granules of cytotoxic cells using motifs from granule proteins and started the work on this as well.
We made many devices for assay (we had a lot of ideas :) ), but unfortunately we ran into a problem with our idea to use cytotoxicity assays to measure the killing response. The problem was that the transient transfection/expression of our devices by electroporation was too low to see responses (<20% efficiency). The large amount of untransfected cells dominated the response. In brainstorming with our advisors we decided to use/substitute T cell activation assays as a reporter of potential killing response as they should be correlated. The granule loading devices were looked at by microscopy with advice and supervision of buddies and advisors. Both of these techniques would allow us to look at transient transfected cell responses without a lot of background response from untransfected cells.
With all of this, we were only able to run a few experiments before the summer was over. We were only able to validate two ANDN gates and the loading of GFP into granules. It’s too bad that the killing assays didn’t work out with our system. Our advisors mentioned that either viral methods of gene delivery or stable cell line creation would probably be necessary to run the cytotoxicity assays so that high expression levels could be obtained. It  was a great experience to come up with devices using information from the literature and natural systems. Using combinations of CARs to construct logic gates had not been reported before and it was also very cool to see that we can use cellular zipcodes to localize proteins to granules.  The CPL is interested in some of our devices and will hopefully follow up after iGEM is over.

Natural killer (NK) cells of the immune system identify cancer and virally-infected cells and kill them. These potent killers travel throughout the body, recognizing proteins and other molecules on the surface of cells. In order to differentiate between healthy and diseased cells, NK cells use a variety of receptors, which bind to specific ligands at the target cells’ surface. The balance between activating and inhibitory signals will tell the NK cell if the target cell is diseased or healthy, respectively. If the target cell is deemed potentially dangerous, the NK cell grips the target cell tightly and creates an immunological synapse at the site of adhesion. Within this immunological synapse, the NK cell releases cytotoxic granules to kill the target cell without harming any nearby cells allowing for a direct, apoptotic death.
Our team will focus on improving NK cells’ specificity and killing efficiency towards certain cancer types. By using synthetic biology tools and logic gates’ design, we hope to create powerful killing biomachines for the fight against cancer. Our newly engineered synthetic devices would have the potential to enhance current adoptive cell-based immunotherapy for cancer patients.

iGEM is more than biology
The iGEM competition not only aims to drive the development of new Biobricks. It also encourages to think about responsibilities, safety and risks in the field of biotechnology. Furthermore, iGEM is about working together and helping other teams in various aspects. Read more how we want to contribute to these goals.
We are the proud representatives of the Technical University Munich. Our small team consists of a mixture of biochemists, biotechnologists, mathematicians and physicists. As a interdisciplinary group, we were able to combine many aspects in our project. Please note that we are the first real group of the TU Munich which participates at the iGEm for real (if you ignore the brief affair in 2008), so we are still beginners...

Ashwini Rahul Akkineni
I finished my Bachelors in biotechnology and now I am almost done with my second semester of my Masters program in Nanobiophysics at the TU Dresden. Studying in Dresden has given me an insight as to how fascinating science research and technology can be and the unbelievable rate at which it is progressing. I look forward to involving myself in research in the field of molecular biology inclined towards regenerative therapies and molecular motors. The iGEM competition is very exciting to me with its main theme revolving around novel genetically engineered organisms; the best part is that we can design our own biological system, based on our idea, which is limited only by our creativity. Apart from iGEM, I enjoy playing KHO-KHO (Indian game), travelling, music and playing video games.
Adithya Nagarakodige Ananth
aka 'Adi', from Bangalore, India. I am a master student of Nanobiophysics at TU Dresden. By education a Biotechnology engineer and by professional experience a metabolome researcher.  Being an engineer iGEM gives me a perfect blend of systematically engineering the biological assembly the way we build any machines. I consider this opportunity as the first step to be a part of the synthetic biology community. In future, I would like to be a researcher in nanobioscience . I am a reader, admirer of creativity and beauty. I am funny, witty, and sarcastic. There are very less things which do not interest me. I love cooking,traveling, pinch of yoga and lots of sports though not good at many.
Habib Tahir Syed Bukhari
Hi my name is Habib, and I am from Pakistan. I did my BSc in Kazakhstan in Genetics and Molecular Biology; currently I am doing my master in Molecular Bioengineering at the Biotec, Dresden. I participe in iGEM because I can do everything what I want and of course have fun with my teammates.
Victor Gordeev
I am Victor Gordeev, 23 years old, from the Republic of Moldova. I finished the Bachelor Program in Molecular Biology at the State University of Moldova. Currently I am a second semester student in the Master Program of Molecular Bioengineering at Biotec, TU-Dresden where I am having an exciting international experience. The interest in synthetic biology is probably innate. I joined IGEM because this is a means to prove that science can be different from how it is usually viewed, there is place for imagination in it not only limited to the ways of dissecting a mechanism, pathway, function but also to designing ingenious approaches meant do deal with various problems. In addition it is perhaps, the greatest LEGO competition ever.
Svea Grieb
Hey there. I, Svea Grieb, am 23 years of age and I am german. Currently, I am majoring in Molecular Bioengineering in the Master program offered by TU Dresden. My Bachelors mainly dealt with nanobiotechnology so i guess I add an extra flavor to the team with my experience. I applied for iGEM because I am a big fan of teamwork! Furthermore I hope to learn new lab and organizational skills of such projects. My further expectations are, to be able to build a scientific network, to realize my areas of interest and figure out the path that lies ahead of me. Meeting new people and making friends is always an additional advantage! I love any kind of outdoor sports, I travel extensively and I am always up for some beer or parties.
Sarah Mansour
I am Sarah Mansour, I majored in Biotechnology for my bachelors and I am currently a student at TU Dresden doing my masters in Molecular Bioengineering. Coming from Cairo, Egypt, has taught me that the market demands for cheaper and efficient solutions are much higher than the supply. Concerning healthcare, it stages a problem as not many can afford the highly priced treatments. I believe that with the current knowledge, technology and concerted efforts, better solutions can be offered at lower costs. I am looking forward to iGEM being an experience where motivated people from around the world can share their views and solutions to various problems through the promising field of genetic engineering.
Mareike Roth
I have already completed my Bachelor’s studies in Biotechnology in Austria. Currently I am pursuing the Master’s Program “Molecular Bioengineering” at the TU Dresden. Furthermore I enjoy Beachvolleyball, Tennis, Frisbee and basically any sport that can be done outdoors. Even though it might not seem special, for me it is the perfect balance to my studies. Taking part in the iGEM competition is very challenging; yet it allows me to follow the whole pathway of a project from idea to final presentation. Besides the professional experience you gain it also shows one its personal strengths and weaknesses which I think is advantageous to know so early in ones carrier. For my future I hope to someday work in the biotechnological or pharmaceutical industry.
Charanya Sampathkumar
I am currently a first year student in the Masters program of Nanobiophysics at the TU Dresden. I have a Bachelors degree in Biotechnology and I hope to pursue a research career. Working in a couple of labs has helped me hone my lab work skills and has enhanced my knowledge in several interdisciplinary fields of science including biophysics and neurobiology. iGEM has been a great learning experience for me so far and I see it as a fantastic opportunity to get to know the demands of real life research. Besides science, I spend most of my free time listening to music, reading books of non – fiction genre and of late, travelling and exploring new places.
Lucas Schirmer
I am an eighth semester student entering the final year of my diploma degree in Biology at the TU Dresden. When I first heard about iGEM, I was very intrigued. The idea of building a synthetic organism to solve problems in normal life presents itself as a major potential for molecular biology. What I like about iGEM is the idea of abstraction. By reducing informational weight and using common standards, we are able to accelerate the development of new synthetic devices and solutions. I am particularly fond of computers and programming. In the future, I hope to pursue a PhD at an interesting research facility.
Jonathan Tam
I have recently completed my Bachelor's degree in Honors Cell Biotechnology at the University of Alberta, Canada. During my degree, I have had the chance to take part in two projects that have greatly piqued my interest in biological research. The first experience was studying macrophage development in the lab of Dr. D. Barreda. The second was my participation in the iGEM competition as a member of the University of Alberta team last year. What I particularly like about iGEM is that biologists are challenged to think like engineers. To switch mindsets and consider cells instead as machines consisting of individual parts that can be assembled to create an organism with desired phenotypes and functions. By combining the well-established engineering principles with biology, I am certain there will be a new 'golden age' in the field of biology.
Supervisors
Kaj Bernhardt
I received B.A.(Hons) and M.Sci.(Hons) degrees in Natural Sciences (Biochemistry) from the University of Cambridge. As a graduate student in the Genomics Department of the Dresden University of Technology, I am interested in the biology of embryonic stem cells and their differentiation to distinct lineages during early development. My PhD project focuses on how differentiated cells are reprogrammed to induced pluripotent stem cells by a few magic proteins.
As a student, I took part in iGEM 2006, and after being instructor to the Dresden iGEM team 2009, I am now trying to advise the 2010 team on their efforts as best as I can.
Johnson Madrid
I am a Biochemist by training and an Electron Microscopy specialist at the MPI-CBG Dresden, where I study the Mechanosensory transduction, structural and functional aspects of Neuronal networks in Drosophila. I had Industrial R&D exposure in my early days, which gave me an insight into synthetic biology, and its potential. The reason for me to join iGem was also to be with students who are not limited with their ideas and the kind of energy they put into you…its amazing! It’s an experience to understand the psychology of Individuals in an International group. I like biking, “cooking inter cultural dishes” and meeting new people in my free time.
Andrew Oates
I’m a group leader at the MPI-CBG in Dresden, where we study the molecular and cellular mechanisms of vertebrate segmentation.   To understand this complex system of coordinated biochemical oscillators we are integrating theoretical modeling with experimental approaches, such as real-time imaging in the zebrafish embryo. I think iGem is a great platform for young scientists to combine their scientific knowledge with engineering principles to generate and learn about novel biological systems. It is an exciting opportunity to aid these students through the creative process of generating product ideas and developing a well rounded project.
Annelie Oswald
Officially I am a Bachelor of Biochemical Engineering and a Master of Molecular Bioengineering, but recently I joined a Developmental Biology Lab at the MPI-CBG.  I’m studying the segmentation clock, which regulates zebrafish somite formation, and eventually would like to rebuild that clock outside the zebrafish.  With the idea of this project came my first exposure to synthetic biology, the concept of engineering biological machines and ultimately iGem.  Unfortunately, I’m too old to be a team ‘member’ but being an ‘advisor’ is also a rewarding experience…really!  In my spare time my favorite thing to do is play, relax with friends and experience new things.
Marko Storch
I am doing my PhD at MPI-CBG in Dresden in Joe Howard's Biophysics group. My main interest lies in engineering principles and emergent properties in the molecular world. To learn about these fascinating phenomena, I am engineering motor proteins and study properties of cytoskeletal systems in vitro using a bottom-up approach. I got interested in IGEM during my master studies in Molecular Bioengineering here in Dresden, but unfortunately it was too late to get a team started. So I am very happy, that students from the Dresden Master Courses can now participate in the IGEM competition each year and I took the chance to contribute as an advisor this time. Working together with the students is very enjoyable! The attitude in this team is great and discussing with fresh minds about all the things from concepts to wet lab tricks is fun and a rewarding experience.

Attributions
We thank Professor Dr. Guhan Jayaraman for providing us with the Acid Tollerance promoter p170  in the plasmid pAMJ399 which also incidently contains the export tag sp310mut2; p170 (BBa_K372001) and sp310mut2 the two basic parts we are submitting to the registry.
We also thank Ms. Sashi Balaprasad for taking the time to help us out with the designing of PCR primers and also providing us the plasmid pNZ8048, containing the NISIN inducible promoter, which we planned to use in our Master Construct but later could not PCR amplify due to time constraints. We plan to use it in our future work.
We are grateful to Professor Dr. Nitish R Mahapatra and Mr. Parshuram Sonawane for providing us with the Sirius Illuminometer which we used for characterizing our part p170 (BBa_K372001) and for further characterization of the existent registry part J23119.
We would also like to thank Professor Dr K Chandraraj and Professor Dr Guhan Jayaraman for their help with administrative work and guidance throughout the course of this project.
Special thanks to all our Seniors and Team members of our previous iGEM team who never hesitated in helping us out.

We thank Professor Dr. Guhan Jayaraman for providing us with the Acid Tollerance promoter p170  in the plasmid pAMJ399 which also incidently contains the export tag sp310mut2; p170 (BBa_K372001) and sp310mut2 the two basic parts we are submitting to the registry.
We also thank Ms. Sashi Balaprasad for taking the time to help us out with the designing of PCR primers and also providing us the plasmid pNZ8048, containing the NISIN inducible promoter, which we planned to use in our Master Construct but later could not PCR amplify due to time constraints. We plan to use it in our future work.
We are grateful to Professor Dr. Nitish R Mahapatra and Mr. Parshuram Sonawane for providing us with the Sirius Illuminometer which we used for characterizing our part p170 (BBa_K372001) and for further characterization of the existent registry part J23119.
We would also like to thank Professor Dr. K Chandraraj and Professor Dr. Guhan Jayaraman for their help with administrative work and guidance throughout the course of this project.
Special thanks to all our Seniors and Team members of our previous iGEM team who never hesitated in helping us out.

Honorary Team Members During the summer, we were joined by two Axolotls . They are studied for their regenrative properties and praised for their constant smile. We built them a habitat in an aquarium tank with rocks and plants and fed them daily. Their presence in our workspaces added a touch of light to our basement laboratory.

Contributions/Attributions/Acknowledgements
For iGEM 2010, the description of each project must clearly attribute work done by the team and distinguish it from work done by others, including the host labs, advisors, and instructors:
For the light circuit, because the registry did not contain the majority of parts crucial to our circuit, we collaborated with teams EPF-Lausanne, PKU, and Davidson-Missouri Western to obtain the relevant parts. From EPF-Lausanne, we received BBa_K191003 and BBa_K191005. We received from PKU Beijing AraC+pBad+T7ptag+Terminator, NahR+pSal+supD+Terminator, the Bistable switch, and other miscellaneous parts. From Davidson-Missouri Western, we received BBa_K091141 and BBa_K091147 to aid in the characterization of the pLac/Mnt hybrid promoter in the distribution. Thanks all for the assistance!
For the E.Cargo project, we obtained the original Tat-PTD DNA and the idea to use Tat from fellow student Will Donovan '12 (william_donovan@brown.edu).
We would like to thank TU Delft for their WikiHacks section and BCCS Bristol for inspiring our menubar design
All other portions of the project were conducted by the undergraduate members of the Brown iGEM team. As detailed on our Obstacles/Lessons page, our advisors are there to answer questions, register us for the Jamboree, and help us troubleshoot protocols, but we are responsible for all other aspects of iGEM and the laboratory.
Gary served as an awesomely optimistic and encouraging mentor and role model
Adrian registered us for the jamboree and took care of hotel/budget logistics
Adrian and Zak helped us troubleshoot lab protocols and taught us how to use equipment
Contributions to the projects were universal. If something in the lab needed to be done, it was done by whoever was available. Particular roles/contributions of note are:
Ethan Richman was the captain of the Light Pattern project and designed the original idea of the circuit and explanatory diagrams
Julius Ho captained the Tat project and led our community outreach efforts.
James Weis was the king of modeling.
Lily Chan designed the logos for our projects and was a crucial resource for all wetlab protocols.
Jen Kao maintained our relationship with our alumni network and communications with other groups.
Tim Johnstone designed the wiki, created the SynBio survey, and took the photos you see on our site.
We'd like to thank our sponsors:

Undergraduates
José Argüelles
He investigated theoretical information for the project, performed general laboratory work and collaborated on the design of the synthesis. He was committed to finish the final construct and spent endless nights running gel electrophoreses.
Pamela Campos
She was in charge of managing and cleaning the material at the laboratory and also helped with general lab work. She contributed by writing the Importation Manual and by going to the Health Department to request information about the permits necessary to import our DNA synthesis.
Cristóbal Cevallos
He contacted possible sponsors, organized a fundraising party and was in charge of the trip logistics to Boston. He worked on general laboratory work, mainly in the characterizations of pBAD, MuC and MuMor.
Jan Contreras
He performed general laboratory work, focusing in the design of the final construct and the MuMor sensitivity tuner. He did the mathematical modelling and characterization of pBAD, MuC and MuMor sensitivity tuners and participated in the registration of the BioBricks.
Héctor Gálvez
He took the leadership of the group and helped organize the work to be done by assigning specific jobs and responsibilities to every team member. He contributed to the logistics of the project and made a calendar with goal dates. He wrote the project summary and he organized most of the information and documentation for the wiki. During the summer he helped with general wet lab work and contacted several government offices for sponsorships.
Andrés Huerta
He was in charge of the design and codification of the team wiki, the T-shirts and the poster. He collaborated with general laboratory work and helped in the DNA importation process.
Tatiana Núñez
She was in charge of the administration of chemical reactants, general laboratory work, and customs information regarding the DNA importation. She registered and submitted the BioBricks.
Diana Ostos
Diana contributed with the internal logistics of the project and ordered and paid the DNA synthesis. She also collaborated with the Importation Manual and helped with general laboratory work. She worked on the development of the MuC sensitivity tuner and the design of the final construct.
Javier Reynoso
During the summer, Javi's main task was to find sponsors for the project, which he achieved quite successfully. He also helped with general laboratory work, but left early for his exchange program in Australia. From there, he still kept tabs with our sponsors.
Flavio Siller
He performed mostly general wet lab work. He designed a program to quickly calculate the amount of enzymes needed for  digestions and ligation reactions. He also helped with the writing of several parts of the wiki.
Instructors
Dr. Mario Álvarez
He was the first one to believe in us and suggested ideas for different applications for the sensor. He donated some material from his own projects and will be accompanying us to the Jamboree.
M. Sc. Sergio García
Sergio taught us hands-on most of the protocols and procedures we needed in the laboratory - from pipetting correctly to preparing electrocompetent cells. He always had a creative explanation for our troubleshooting and encouraged us to think out of the box. Sergio always supported us with lab material and was incredibly patient with us.
Advisors
Dr. Manuel Zertuche
Dr. Zertuche, on behalf of the Biotechnology and Food Division of the Tecnológico de Monterrey, was the main sponsor of the project and helped us with the planning and the timeline in order to achieve our short and long term goals. He provided us with the facilities and gave us his approval for almost everything we asked for. We really appreciate his  advice and support, and thank him for believing in us.
M. Sc. José Manuel Aguilar
He helped us with the theoretical information and developed with us the idea of the intelligent biosensor. He also advised us on troubleshooting.
M. Sc. Johari Salgado
Johari selflessly shared his laboratory with us and was always willing to help us get material and equipment.
Felipe López
He instructed us on how to use the microplate reader for the characterization of our parts.
Collaboration with other iGEM Teams
We contributed with other universities by participating on their surveys; unfortunately we weren’t able to answer all of them, but we tried to have an active contribution.
Mexico-UNAM-CINVESTAV and UNAM-Genomics_Mexico
We contacted and befriended the other two Mexican teams (Mexico-UNAM-CINVESTAV and UNAM-Genomics_Mexico) in order to start an open collaboration in our country and encourage the development of synthetic biology. We exchanged points of view regarding the problems we had with Customs and their advice was taken into account when writing the Importation Manual .
British Columbia (2009)
We used some of the BioBricks submitted by the 2009 British Columbia team (pBAD, pBAD weak, pBAD strong), proved their correct function and re-characterized their pBAD BioBrick.
TU Delft
We would finally like to thank the TU Delft team, as we used part of their code on our wiki.

Beyond Biobricks
In addition to working hard in the lab, our team cares about the social implications of synthetic biology and developing new tools to push further along the synthetic biology frontier!! We interviewed some of the leading researchers in the synthetic biology field. We asked them about their opinions on the complex interaction between intellectual property law and synthetic biology. We also developed a new Mammalian standard for the registry! We hope this will help encourage future synthetic biology research in mammalian genetics.

MIT iGEM 2010
The 2010 MIT iGEM team. We are biological engineers, physicists, electrical engineers, chemical engineers, mathematicians, and computer scientists.
Programmable, Self-constructing Biomaterials
The 2010 MIT iGEM team focused on the control and production of self-constructing and self-repairing living biomaterials through both bacterial and mammalian engineering. We ventured to set up the framework for material formation in both types of cells, for future applications in living, self-repairing materials and in vitro organogenesis respectively.
We have accomplished far beyond what we expected of ourselves! In addition to our project, we have created a new Mammalian Biobrick standard, contributed original parts for mammalian cells and bacteriophage, and we have biobricked two working toggles for the registry.

This is Andrew. He's pretty much a
baller
joke. Nah, just messin'. Andrew, better known to the team as Andre, has an intense bromance with another team member, Paul Muir.
This is Arvind. He's our secret weapon!
This is Crystal. She is a rising junior in Course 10 who is interested in nitric oxide!
This is Grant :cough: ...I mean, Abdul. As you can tell, he's a pretty scary guy. Fun fact: Toward the middle of the summer, Grant started literally living in the lab.
This is Jstev. He's a rising senior from... wait for it... the University of Kansas! But we consider him to be an honorary MIT baller. Jstev gets paid more than we do and also has free housing. :( Chances are that Jstev is older than you, and he is known to some as Mr. Potatohead.   ...JSTEV!!!
This is Joy. She's Asian!
This is Laura. She works with mammals!
I'm Leanna. I'm a rising junior in Course 20. I like gymnastics and NCAA basketball (men's). I have an intense passion for the Situation.
This is Paul. He lived in Switzerland for years, and yes, he's related to John Muir.
This is Shawn. His unorthodox protocols may one day culminate in several BioBrick standards.
This is Shirley. She's a vegan, but apparently wouldn't mind feasting on her fellow humans. She also enjoys the artist Joanna Newsom, implying she has a few screws loose in her head. Most importantly, however, Shirley is *hungry.*

About: A guy with enthusiasm to create a bright future!
About iGEM: This is my second time in an IGEM team. The competition is focus on synthetic biology, which is a completely new concept of engineering. I think it is another good way to explore into the secret of life, and it is possible that one day we could reconstruct cells and even life. Moreover, synthetic biology is changing the way biologists think and do, and will eventually have great effect on biology and everyday life. I am looking forward to this day and hoping to participate in such a change.

The prion circuit that we have used in the Regulating Mars Temperature part of our project was developed by Li and Lindquist (2000). But we were the first to use it in a terraforming context and think about its extraordinaries possibilities and applications in Synthetic Biology. We also have made a BioBrick based in the prion.
We obtained pET28a plasmid containing soybean’s PM2 gene from Yun Liu and colleges (Liu et al, 2010) and transformed BL21 E.coli strain with it. In order to prove protective effects of this gene we followed the methods of the named publication, adding more combinations of harsh temperatures than the authors did, although we did not carry out any study related to high-salinity tolerance of E.coli expressing the PM2 protein. We also differentiated between bacteria growing without glycerol and those with 8% glycerol. Instead of using t- statistical analysis, we carried out a non-parametrical test (Kruskal-Wallis) for each one of the four treatments. We also tried to transform yeast with PM2 gene; however, due to some experimental problems, we did not manage to do it.
We based our Yeastworld model in a pre-existing static model called Daisyworld developed by Watson and Lovelock (1983). We modified and spread the model to make it dynamic, to include the prion behaviour and to apply it to a terraforming proccess.
The rest the parts of our project (see, for example, the Mars Simulation Chamber, the Microbial Albedo Recorder and the Red House experiments, the Human Practices and Safety sections) were entirely designed, developed and put into test by us.

From 2010.igem.org
Chuck Norris facts:

Our mentors from the Department of Biotechnology of the National Institute of Chemistry (NIC) were approached by the teachers from the Faculty of computer and information sciences if they could participate in this years's project. After some thought it become apparent that the simplest way to attempt to join those two fields might be using DNA binding proteins in order to achieve information processing in cells. Therefore at the meeting of student candidates interested in participating at iGEM in March 2010, we were given the task to explore the possibilities that DNA binding proteins might provide to achieve information processing and to prepare individual project proposals within a month. Initially we considered several different directions, since students of biotechnology saw the great potentials for applications in the biosynthesis. Among the suggesstions of the selected candidates there were also ideas to attempt to improve the bioynthesis of violacein and carotenoids based on DNA as a scaffold, particularly since the invividual genes for those two pathways were already deposited in the Registry of parts and were also experimentally verified. This in fact later become the main topic of our project. During the brainstorming sessions in summer, students of computer sciences proposed to investigate if we could extend the basic idea to genetic oscillators, since it had been proposed earlier that a cooperativity of DNA binding repressors (lac dimer, Tet tetramer) is a prerequisite for generating the oscillations.
 
The laboratory that hosted our iGEM team did not have any previous experiences with zinc fingers, engineering biosynthetic pathways or modelling oscillators, so the project was completely new for mentors as well. However mentors from the NIC seeked support of additional external advisors from NIC and from the University of Ljubljana, who are specialists in certain experimental techniques that could be useful for our project. They helped us learn and use techniques, such as surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and HPLC and TLC analysis of reaction products. All gene constructs were obtained from the Registry or ordered as synthetic genes exclusively for this project.
 
All the experiments connected to cloning, protein isolation, characterisation (SDS, WB) and purification, FRET experiments, EMSA, repression assays... as well as data analysis were performed exclusively by the undergraduate student team members. The only exception was that the advisors helped students with operating the instruments for SPR and HPLC ad MS analysis, which was done by the MS operator. Student team members were also assisted for the use of confocal microscope at the beginning.  
 
In this way we were encouraged to try and learn as much as we could every day and to take benefit from all the various techniques and protocols we got in touch with. Apart from the fact that the project was quite intensive and laborious, we were given so many beneficial knowledge it is really hard to imagine. Not only the final goal or destination, the path we have taken makes all the difference.
During the summer we also helped other teams participating in iGEM with filling their surveys (check the results here: https://2010.igem.org/Team:METU_Turkey_Software ) and with characterization of several parts previosly existing in the Registry ( BBa_I0500 , BBa_K165007 , BBa_K165006 , BBa_K274002 ).

Team:EPF Lausanne/Acknowledgements
From 2010.igem.org
Attributions and Contributions
All ten students on the team contributed significantly in the project. The bulk of the lab work was done by the team members, who were sometimes (especially at the beginning) helped by the PhDs (Henrike, Carine and Nicolas) or occasionally other people in the lab. * The PhDs were especially helpful when experiments didn't go as expected.
We (the students) came up with the project idea ourselves. Our advisors (Prof. Maerkl and Prof Deplancke) helped us ask the right questions and pointed us in the right direction when we were lost. And last but not least, they found all the sponsors and made our iGEM experience possible in the first place!
The beautiful drawings on our wiki are the exclusive work of Solange. Solange, your drawings are awesome and so are you!
Acknowledgements
We thank Prof. Guido Favia and Dr. Claudia Damiani from the University of Camerino for the Asaia strains, the protocols relatives to Asaia and for having been source of inspiration for our project.
We would like to thank Prof. Bruno Lemaitre from EPFL for his advice and the possibility to conduct experiments with drosophila in his lab.
Many thanks to Prof. Christian Doerig for having kindly provided us with the genomic DNA of Plasmodium falciparum from witch we extracted the P25 and P28 DNA sequences.

From 2010.igem.org
EPFL (Federal Polytechnical School of Lausanne)
EPFL is one of the two Ecoles Polytechniques fédérales in Switzerland. Like its sister institution, ETHZ, it has three missions: education, research and technology transfer at the highest international level. Associated with several specialised research institutes, the two EPFs form the EPF domain, which is directly dependent on the Federal Department of Home Affairs.
EPFL, in its idyllic location on the shores of Lake Geneva, brings together a campus of more than 10,000 people. By its novel structure, the school stimulates collaboration between students, professors, researchers and entrepreneurs. These daily interactions give rise to new and groundbreaking work in science, technology and architecture.
Here you can see the offical video clip of our beautiful school.
And now, some photos taken in the lab.

What we did
Short description of our work, our results and our supporters
The creation of certain constructs was necessary for our two systems for cell selection by means of apoptosis: “Cut’N’Survive” and “Jump-Or-Die”. We searched for sources of the DNA sequences we needed and found several supporters which are listed below.
Most genes and promoters were amplificated via PCR with overhang-primers with the BioBrick prefix or suffix. If the sequence contained a EcoR1-, Pst1-, Xba1-, Spe1- or Not1- restriction site, we used mutagenesis primers and fusioned both DNA parts by fusion PCR. All PCRs worked out, even the fusion PCRs.
The length of the PCR products were tested by agarose gel electrophoresis. We tried to sequence our PCR products, but obtained poor results and resorted to sequencing the plasmids.
In parallel, we made competent cells and multiplied ccdB (death gene)-vectors with different antibiotic resistances. All components were digested with the appropriate restriction enzymes. The samples were cleaned with a PCR clean up kit or dephosphorylated to reduce false ligations.
We ligated our constructs and several interim stages with the 3A-assembly according to our schedule. The ligations were transformed to E.coli DH5α strains and selected by antibiotics. Afterwards, some colonies were picked and we tested the insertion of the construct by colony PCR.
If the colony PCR resulted in bands of the right size, we extracted the plasmids from overnight cultures and sequenced the samples with forward and reverse BioBrick primers.
Unfortunately, not all BioBricks were cloned succesfully. However, we were able to produce 4 BioBricks, one of which represents a full construct while the other three are intermediates. The system wasn't completed on time, so we weren´t able to test them in eukarytic cell lines.
Besides, we found out that the CMV-promoter we ordered from the BioBrick registry ( BBa_J52034 ) was in fact a lacI gene, which resulted in the procrastination of our plan. We have sent the correction to the registry to facilitate future teams.
Our notebook with detailed descriptions can be found here: ApoControl notebook
The protocols we used are listed here: Protocols
The Biobricks we submitted:
BBa_K368004: attP+eGFP+SV40PA

Pictures of us hard at work!
What we did
The Penn State iGEM team had bi-weekly meetings prior to the end of the spring semester. We then went home for a small break until reconvening May 24th. During the first week, we had training under the supervision of Mike Speer and Amin Espah. During our training week, we learned the procedures and protocols to Mini-prepping, running digests, running PCRs, doing Gel Electrophoresis, Gel extractions and purifications, Ligations, and finally, Transformations.
In addition to this, Mike taught us how to make the necessary medias in which we could grow our transformed E. coli and parts. We were taught proper lab etiquette and safety techniques to insure that we, and everyone around, would be safe.
We were introduced to the Parts Registry and online articles to help us decide what project we wished to do. After researching for an extent of time, we chose a project dealing with Oxygen sensitive promoters.
Our Background
Andrew Kirk is from Hersey, Pennsylvania. He is a sophomore majoring in Biological Engineering.
Erik McCann is from Tamaqua, Pennsylvania. He is a junior majoring in Biological Engineering and plans on either attending Graduate school or entering the work force. He has interests in biological engineering focusing on either food processing or biomass energy.
Lauren Rossi is from Pittston, Pennsylvania. She is a junior majoring in Microbiology and either wants to attend Graduate School or enter the work force after college. She is interested in microbiology and music.
Anisha Katyal is from Fort Lauderdale, Florida. She is a junior majoring in biology and plans on attending Medical School.
Rebecca Hennessey is from Avondale, Pennsylvania. She is a junior majoring in Microbiology and wants to attend Graduate School for Biomedical Sciences. Her interests include cooking and baking, viruses and microbes, and traveling to new interesting places.
Trip Garland is from Virginia. He is a senior at the University of Virginia and is a chemical engineering major. He spent 10 weeks this summer at Penn State for R.E.U. (research experience for undergraduates) and helping the iGEM team.
Mike Kang is from Maryland. He is a sophomore majoring in English and Chemical Engineering at the University of Maryland. He is one of two R.E.U. students who helped with Penn State's iGEM team.

Who did what
The teams were assembled during our winter quarter.  During this term we went around to classes and had weekly meeting to introduce students to synthetic biology through a series of guest lectures.  During the spring students participated in brainstorming projects related to the sponsoring Faculty advisors labs (Baker, Mougous, Klavins, Sauro) and came up with the project they wanted to carry out.  Over the summer, students completed all of the experimental work, but worked closely with both graduate students and faculty advisors to plan the most pertinent experiments and make the most of our limited time.
The Gram Positive Therapeutic
Chris Eiben, Sean Wu, Peixian Liu, David Zong, Ivan Huang, Cindy Wu, Denny Luan designed, expressed, purified, and characterized CapD, CapD_CP, and the 87 CapD_CP variants.
The Gram Negative Therapeutic
Matthew Harger, Matthew Coyne, and Jesa Landis cloned and characterized the Tse2/Tsi2 locus into BioBrick parts.
Laura Austin and Justin De Leon recombineered and characterized the T7 promoter into the T6SS fosmid.
New Tools
Jeff Johnson developed the WikiDust and PartsRobot software. Jeff also wrote BBF RFC 68 . Michal Galdzicki and Professor Herbert M. Sauro read and revised the document.
Tomas Huber BioBricked the f1 origin, lacI repressor, and lacI regulated T7 promoter, taking them from the protein expression vector pET29b+ from Novagen.  He also constructed and characterized 4 protein-based expression cassette's made from new AND old BioBricks.

German Cancer Research Center
The German Cancer Research Center (Deutsches Krebsforschungszentrum, DKFZ) is the largest biomedical research institute in Germany and is a member of the Helmholtz Association of National Research Centers. More than 2,000 staff members, including 850 scientists, are investigating the mechanisms of cancer and are working to identify cancer risk factors. They provide the foundations for developing novel approaches in the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of cancer. In addition, the staff of the Cancer Information Service (KID) offers information about the widespread disease of cancer for patients, their families, and the general public.
BioQuant
In addition to the experimental acquisition of biological data and their analysis with bio-statistical and bio-computational methods, the modeling and simulation of these processes as well as their validation have become more important than ever before. For small systems such as single molecules and small complexes, molecular models have already provided significant insights leading not only to a better understanding of interactions, but also to the rational design of new drugs. For more complex systems (large molecular complexes, cells, organs and populations), such analysis is only preliminary. On this basis, the University of Heidelberg has established the research network for the ""Quantitative Analysis of Molecular and Cellular Biological Systems (BIOQUANT)"" which integrates research groups from different disciplines and help them to focus on these research tasks.

Acknowledgements
First and foremost, we would like to thank Professor Dr. Roland Eils for bringing together such a diverse team of students and share not only his vision, but also his resources with us. It is far from usual to put this much trust (and money) into a student research group, and it cannot be overstated how much we appreciate it.
Our greatest thanks go, without any doubt, to Dr. Dirk Grimm. His total devotion and dedication, his patience and his ability to take our project to levels that we couldn't even have dreamt of have helped to bring out the best in each of our experiments.
Without Jens Keienburg none of us would have been part of iGEM or would have ever found our inner dancing abilities (that for some of us were deeply hidden). But he believed in us, even after the first disastrous dancing lessons, and made us into the first iGEM team that would also be able to win any cheerleading competition. To offset the effects of our dancing workout, he fed us with pizza whenever possible.  Of course we are also thankful for all the support and the management of the lab.
We would like thank all of our advisors, who have been a pleasure to work with (although we are not sure they can say the same thing about us), and have been extremely patient with our questions and problems. They were always there for us and even in desperate and laborious times, they stayed with us even if that meant seeing the sunrise from the BioQuant balcony.
PhD Christina Raupp, for helping with the planning and conducting of virus production and in vivo experiments.
Clarissa Liesche, who brought us the joy of ELISA, helped us with the measurements and supplied us with everything from enyzmes to energy drinks. It was also a lot of fun exploring and manipulating the wiki with her.
Subgroup leader Joel Beaudouin, who alwys listened and helped us measuring at the flow cytometer, SP2, SP5, epifluorescence...just every measurement.
Kathleen Börner, for her continuous help and scientific and non-scientific support, she was always there to help us with everything we would ask of her, all along the way.
Marina Bechtle was always ready to help us even on a very short notice without any complaints! Special thanks for her help with the flow cytometry measurements.
Paula Gonzalez, who spent hours and hours on the microscope with us and helped us analyzing the fluorescence of thousands of cells.
Without your help, sacrifice and dedication, we wouldn't be anywhere close to here.
We would also like to thank Eike Kienle for his great help with the constructs, Nina Schuermann for the introduction for the luminometer and advice on the contructs, Stefan Mockenhaupt for his constructs and all groups of the BioQuant who helped us to collect billions of HEK cells in three days, Marlies Muernseer, UniKlinikum Mannheim, for supplying us with Mouse Primary Hepatocytes every Monday and her incredible help.
The modeling subteam would like to thank Dr. Charley Choe for his support, Dr. Rainer König for the nice debate and the suggestion to use neural network, and Nao, Tim and Stephen, from the iGEM 2009 team, whose efforts pointed us in the right direction and give us a nice ground to built on. Thanks to Stephen also for his kind help with the RFCs and part submission.
The website design team would like to thank especially SELFHTML (in German). We wouldn't have been able to create such a wiki, both from the view of graphics and coding, without using this great tutorial glossary. Furthermore, it helped us avoiding many annoying forum trolls who impede any effective search for appropriate problem solutions.
Very much appreciated are, of course, the companies, foundations and the academic sponsors, who believed in our project and sponsored our work.
We have to be thankful to our families, our partners and our friends, who had to put up with our strange work timetables and our non availability during the last four months. Thank you all for understanding what science and iGEM meant to us during all this time and helping us to push through the harder times on our way.
On a strict personal level, and without ever revealing why, we also have to thank:  Nespresso, Ritter Sport (and chocolate in general), Schokakola, the people from Burkina Faso, the dead balloon syndrome, big waterfalls, self-controlled trains, random bacteria who decide to grow up where they shouldn't and contaminate our cell culture, Polish mint-flavoured Vodka, green comfy chairs, table football, explicit hip-hop songs, our mystery coffee buddy, mojitos, tigers, easy-to-strip lab coats, emotional breakdowns in the lab, all of the Harry Potter characters, terrific Mensa food, whoever once forgot to lock the door to the great 7th floor balcony, Bellini...
all of these made iGEM experience... truly unique and unforgettable.
Thank you!!!

Students
Aastha Mathur
Before she decided to come all the way from India to Germany to do her masters in Molecular Biosciences with majors in Systems Biology, Aastha had already a bachelor degree in Bioinformatics from there. Her bachelor thesis was about creating a web tool for calculation of protein interactions which she carried out at the Indian Institute of Science. For iGEM, she is a part of the modelling force. Working with systems and synthetic biology has been of prime interest to her and, of course, she thinks with this we can achieve our ultimate goal: creating tiny pet dinosaurs.
Alejandro Macías Torre
After finishing his bachelor studies in Universidad Autónoma in Madrid with a bachelor thesis in directed evolution of dihydroxyacetone kinases, Alejandro spent a year working in the Biocatalysis department of a Japanese company with the program Vulcanus in Japan. Currently he pursues the master program on Molecular Biosciences with major in Systems Biology in Heidelberg University. One of his strongest reasons to join iGEM was the unique opportunity of combining science with creativity, something that does not happen very frequently. He thinks that synthetic biology can help mankind take steps forward at the same time it provides some insight about the basic principles of life.
Aleksandra Anna Kołodziejczyk
Aleksandra (aka Ola) is a student of Molecular Biosciences majoring in Molecular and Cellular Biology at the University of Heidelberg. She completed her bachelor degree in Biotechnology within Job Creation Oriented Biotechnology Program held by a consortium of European universities in Perugia, Italy. Working in labs at K.U.Leuven, MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology, EMBL Hamburg and ZMBH allowed her to gain wetlab skills. She considers iGEM challenging and great experience.
Dmytro Mayilo
Dima is a Master student in Molecular Biosciences with the major in Molecular and Cellular Biology, here in Heidelberg.  The topic of his Bachelor thesis, which he completed in National Taras Shevchenko University of Kyiv was production and characterization of monoclonal antibodies specific to FGFR-1.  Before applying to iGEM he thought it would be mainly focused on lab work, however it turned out to be amazingly interesting adventure, where everyone worked side by side to achieve the goal.

Dominik Niopek
As member of the first iGEM team Heidelberg, he participated in the iGEM competition in 2008 and is in love with the concepts of synthetic biology and iGEM ever since. After completing his bachelor thesis on synthetic chemotaxis fusion receptors, Dominik did an internship in the research group of Dr. Richard Cohen at Boston University in summer 2009. Being back on the iGEM-track now, Dominik is very happy to be a member of the team Heidelberg 2010 again and he is looking forward to work in this years creative and motivated team and to a great and fun iGEM summer.
Elena Cristiano
Elena completed her degree in Biotechnology at the University of Florence, with a thesis in synthesis of new NGF-agonists deriving from D-phenylalanine. She spent 1 year and a half working as a research assistant at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in a project whose aim was the remediation of lands contaminated with plutonium. Currently she is a student of Molecular Biosciences, major in Systems Biology at the University of Heidelberg. Elena is very enthusiastic about being part of iGEM 2010, because she considers it a very challenging and unique experience.
Friederike Köppe
Friederike started her Psychology studies at the University of Trier within the old system for a Diplom (graduate degree). After an academic exchange at the University of Salamanca in Spain, she is finishing her studies at the University of Heidelberg. For her diplom thesis, she is working on neural correlations of emotional recognition in patients with borderline personality disorder. After completing her degree in Psychology, she will go on with a second study in human medicine. Friederike joined iGEM bcause she loved the idea, working in a field of international students, learning something about other disciplines of science and applying her psychological skills.
Jan-Ulrich Schad
Jan-Ulrich has finished his bachelor thesis about a systems biological approach to TGF-beta induced signaling in the biology program at the University of Heidelberg. He is now in his 3rd semester of the masters program Molecular Biosciences with the major Systems Biology. The fascination about promising possibilities for alternative energy production using synthetic organisms attracted him to the field of synthetic biology. The important interplay with systems biology for the design of more effective organisms is where he wants to participate in the future. He likes iGEM as it is open source, rewards creativity and brings together pretty funny people.
↑
Jude Al Sabah
Jude is a third semester student in the Master’s program of Molecular Biotechnology at the University of Heidelberg. After obtaining her Bachelor degree in Biotechnology and Genetic Engineering, where her main focus was on Human Genetics and Pharmacogenetics, she came to Heidelberg, attracted by the many research facilities and the scientific environment the city has to offer. She thinks that joining iGEM was one of the best decisions she has ever made. For her, it’s the right place to gain unique experiences in the field of synthetic biology as well as in working within a team of highly experienced students who come from various majors and countries. She greatly enjoys working in synthetic biology and the company of her lovely lab partners.
Laura-Nadine Schuhmacher
Laura has just completed her Bachelor's degree in Biology at the University of Heidelberg this summer before joining the iGem team. For her bachelor thesis she was working on the evolution of transcription factors in the zebrafish retina. Her laboratory experience has so far been focused on neural differentation, development and marine biology. She will further her studies in the major Developmental Biology within the Master's program Molecular Biosciences in Heidelberg. Laura joined iGem in order to experience a novel field of biology and because she is interested in the scientific as well as the socio-cultural implications of synthetic biology.
Lea Flocke
Lea Flocke is a Biology diploma student at Eberhard-Karls-University in Tübingen where she will write her diploma thesis post iGEM on cellular motile functions driven by the transcription factor serum response factor (SRF). After her A-Levels, she studied two years in Darmstadt, where she did internships: for example, on Postranscriptional Gene Regulation and RNA Therapeutics. During her graduate studies, Lea got an insight into functional proteomics, cell biology, human genetics and during her internship at the Bioquant, Heidelberg into systems biology. There, she was interested in iGEM and sees this competition as a great chance to learn how to arrange one's scientific projects. She is fascinated by the huge number of possibilities that arise through synthetic biology.
Lorenz Adlung
Systems Biology is the major curriculum and the most intriguing scope of science for Lorenz. Now, he is a student of the international Master's program of Molecular Biosciences at Heidelberg University. His Bachelor thesis focused on bacterial chemotaxis networks in silico and in vivo. It is an honor for Lorenz to be a member of the iGEM Team Heidelberg, which allows him to get insights into the nascent discipline of Synthetic Biology. Engineering biological circuits attracts exceptional interests of theoreticians and experimentalists alike. Lorenz wants to benefit from offered interdisciplinary collaborations to illuminate the design principles of life.

Marcus Podewski
Marcus was smuggled into the Heidelberg iGEM team by a fundamentalist animal protection and anti-genetic engineering movement to destroy the system from within, to burn it to the ground and to leave all participants with angst (Hegels 'Weltgeist' is descending and it will confuse all of you!) ... Besides such community services, he's studying History and Philosophy at the Universitiy of Heidelberg within the old system for a Magister (graduate degree) and a teaching degree. In order to pay his rent, Marcus works as a museum education officer in the UNESCO-World Heritage Monastery Lorsch and previously in the concentration camp memorial Mittelbau-Dora. He joined iGEM to elevate his philosophical studies to a more practical level and to apply his knowledge in bio- and technology ethics.
Philipp Bayer
Philipp was part of the iGEM Team Heidelberg 2008 and since then knows the obvious reason to join the competition again: iGEM simply is the most beautiful competition existing in biology and its mix of constructive creativity and team work guarantees a uniquely inspiring science experience. Philipp's beyond-iGEM scientific interests are in neuroscience and after finishing his bachelor thesis at the Interdisciplinary Centre for Neuroscience at University of Heidelberg, he will start his master studies in Neuroscience. Since Philipp has been mentoring science projects for high school kids for years, he also enjoys the interdisciplinary atmosphere of the Human Practice Projects in science communication in which he's involved.
Rebecca Berrens
Rebecca is a first year master's student in the Molecular Biotechnology program at the University of Heidelberg. She recently finished her bachelor thesis on drosophila microRNA binding site identification at the European Molecular Biology Laboratory. Joining the iGEM Team Heidelberg 2010, Rebecca seeks to link her strong background on microRNAs to bioengineering and discover a completely new area in synthetic biology within a creative research team.
Rudolf Pisa
Rudi is not a spy (or is he?)! He’s just participating in the Cambridge-Heidelberg exchange programme. In Cambridge he was reading Natural Sciences Tripos that allowed him to gain insights into molecular biology as well as chemistry in which he specialized last year. He’s very grateful for the opportunity to be part of the iGEM team Heidelberg this year. It helped him not only to acquire some new lab experience but also to gain many other transferable skills. Rudi especially values the possibility of developing new projects from the beginning and working with a very dynamic and enthusiastic group of people. In his opinion, synthetic and chemical biology are the most exciting and promising fields for future advancement in health sciences.

Stefan Kleinsorg
Stefan is a Master's student in Molecular Biosciences - Major Molecular and Cellular Biology. He has finished his Bachelor in Biology one year ago, working on protein-protein interaction characterization. As synthetic biology is a very promising track in developing new methods and tools, he is very enthusiastic about the options given in the iGEM competition. He enjoys working in a versatile team of students and hopes to be able to contribute his wet lab experience. Besides that, he also looks forward to work on a convincing design for project presentation.
Stefan Neumann
Stefan decided to join the major Systems Biology of the masters program Molceular Biosciences, after finishing his Bachelor thesis about microevolution of chemotaxis pathways in Escherichia coli in the biology program at the University of Heidelberg. One of his strongest reasons to join the iGEM team 2010 was the possibility to take the small step from analysing how things work to designing them himself and using synthetic biology to develop functional biological applications. He now looks forward to work in a young field with many unanswered questions and the possibility to work with people from different fields.
Thomas Uhlig
Currently, Thomas pursues the master program Molecular Biosciences with major in Molecular and Cellular Biology. Beforehand, he acquired his bachelor in Molecular Biotechnology at the Technical University of Dresden, already with a focus on genetic engineering. In his opinion, the fundamental modification of the living world by synthetic biology is the only chance of mankind in the final war against the machines. Thomas took the opportunity to participate at this early stage by joining Heidelberg's iGEM team. After several weeks of wet lab work, he moved to the graphic design front and aims for an appealing presentation of an ingenious project.
Xiaoting Wu
Xiaoting finished her Bachelor studies in Molecular Cellular Biology at the University of Heidelberg and she will go on with her Master studies in Molecular Biosciences (Major Cancer Biology), which is a collaboration between the University and the German Cancer Research Centre. During her studies, Xiaoting became highly interested in gene therapy due to several internships at the German Cancer Research Centre, different departments of the University of Heidelberg and Imperial College London. In her opinion, synthetic biology can revolutionize gene therapy by creating non-existing parts which will reduce side effects and increase the efficiency of gene therapy methods. She is glad to work with a nice group of students and advisors and is looking forward to the jamboree!

Instructors
Dr. Dirk Grimm
Dr. Grimm is the leader of the junior research group ""Virus-host interactions"" which was founded in late 2007 as an integral part of the Cluster of Excellence CellNetworks as well as of the Dept. of Infectious Diseases/Virology at Heidelberg University. Central goals of his team are to basically understand, rationally improve and therapeutically harness the exquisite potency and specificity of human RNAi mechanisms as well as of gene transfer vectors derived from molecularly evolved Adeno-associated viruses. In his first year as an iGEM instructor, he very much enjoys and appreciates the unique opportunities provided by this exciting competition, by the interdisciplinary teams of highly motivated, clever and talented young students from all over the world, and in general by the rapidly emerging field of Synthetic Biology to juxtapose science and engineering. Like all iGEM participants, he cherishes the fact that we currently witness the dawn of a thrilling new research era in which SynBio will mature into a powerful and thriving goal-oriented force with extraordinary potential to synergize with analytical approaches and to ultimately transform biotechnology and many further central aspects of our lives.
Jens Keienburg
Jens is a PhD student in Systems Biology and works on the parameterization of the circadian oscillation network in Neurospora. He has continuously been an iGEM instructor since 2008, when he co-initiated the Heidelberg team. The acquaintance with so many diverse team members, the innovative and popular projects, and the intensive work with the team make iGEM for him every year a new entrepreneurial adventure. To describe iGEM in three words: vision, passion, and teamwork.

Contributions and Attributions
The overall organization of our team has been the responsibility of Prof. Dr. Roland Eils. Dr. Dirk Grimm, who is a fellow at the Bioquant institute with a strong background in adeno-associated viruses and RNA interference, has joined this iGEM team as instructor. In the spirit of iGEM, the main project idea was designed by the students themselves. The vast majority of the work has been conducted by the students with only minor exceptions, where German law required the inolvement of an instructor or advisor.
Main Project Idea
The initiative for the project idea (i.e. viral therapy with adeno-associated viruses, which is special for its low safety level 1) has been developed by our students. Encouraged by the work of Dr. Grimm and others, we further decided to focus on RNA interference as potent instrument for gene regulation.
In the following we distinguish between students, advisors/instructors, external advisors, and service providers.
miMeasure
The design of the measurement standard construct for shRNA or miRNA silencing strengths has been done by the students with support by advisors. This standard has been inspired by the measurement standard for synthetic promoters (Team Heidelberg 2009, RFC 41 ) and the prokaryotic promoter measurement kit (Jason Kelly, RFC 19 ). The design in annotated sequence format of the final construct has been conducted by students. The basic construct has been synthesized by Geneart, and the following replacements of parts (in particular binding sites) within the construct have been cloned by students. This includes the design of cloning strategies.
miTunes
The design of the tuning construct to silence target genes via shRNA has been made by the students together with instructors and advisors. The final design in annotated sequence format has been conducted by students. Source DNA (e.g. luciferase gene, promoter sequences, terminators) has been provided by advisors/instructors. The DNA has been modified/reassembled via PCR/cloning by students.
Design of shRNA-like miRNA sequences
The design of imperfect shRNA sequences to achieve various silencing strengths has been designed by students with support by advisors/instructors. The design in annotated sequence format and cloning of these sequences into the miMeasure construct has been done by students.
Measurement of shRNA silencing strengths
Measurements were done by the students under close supervision by advisors of the team to avoid the risk of damages to the expensive devices such as a wide-field and a confocal microscope, a flow cytometer, and a microplate reader. Measurement settings have also been designed in agreement with instructors/advisors.
miBEAT
The design of the model to predict silencing strengths of imperfect shRNAs has been done by the students with support by advisors. The implementation itself has been done by students. The design of the miBEAT-GUI to access the gene silencing model has been inspired by alumni of the iGEM Heidelberg 2009 team, the implementation has been done by students from our team.
Hepatocyte Identification via miR-122
The strategy to design a miRNA binding site pattern within the miMeasure construct using random assembly PCR (Heidelberg 2009 team, RFC 42 ) has been developed by students. Theoretical background on miRNA expression profiles has been given by advisors.
Virus capsid shuffling
We have followed two approaches for the capsid shuffling: (1) it has been conducted using the Alberta approach from 2009 ( RFC 47 ) in all respects by the students; (2) it has been conducted using a protocol published previously by Grimm et al. in close supervision by instructors/advisors. The digestion, ligation, and cloning of the capsid gene have been conducted by students, partially also supported by instructors/advisors.
Cell Culture
Taught by instructors/advisors and conducted completely and independently by students themselves.
Virus selection
Virus clones which are selective for hepatocytes have been selected under close supervision of instructors in a safety level 2 laboratory. The picking of the evolved clone itself has been done by a student.
Mouse study
The infection of a mouse to test a potential virus clone on its selectivity for hepatocytes has been done by an instructor for legal reasons in the presence of a student who had had already experience with mice and therefore could have done it herself.
Human Practice
The philosophical reflection, the psychological survey, and the dance performance have been done solely by students.
Documentation
The complete documentation has been done by students except the introduction, conclusion and attribution, which have been written together with an advisor. The complete documentation has been proofread and criticized by advisors.
Logo, wiki, poster, and presentation design
The team logo, the poster and the presentation have been designed by students. Advice has been given by Lange+Pflanz, a marketing agency and sponsor of our team. The layout of the wiki has been done solely by students.
Funding
A research proposal to apply for funding has been written by students after discussions involving the complete team.

Marcus Podewski
Marcus was smuggled into the Heidelberg iGEM team by a fundamentalist animal protection and anti-genetic engineering movement to destroy the system from within, to burn it to the ground and to leave all participants with angst (Hegels 'Weltgeist' is descending and it will confuse all of you!) ... Besides such community services, he's studying History and Philosophy at the Universitiy of Heidelberg within the old system for a Magister (graduate degree) and a teaching degree. In order to pay his rent, Marcus works as a museum education officer in the UNESCO-World Heritage Monastery Lorsch and previously in the concentration camp memorial Mittelbau-Dora. He joined iGEM to elevate his philosophical studies to a more practical level and to apply his knowledge in bio- and technology ethics.
Philipp Bayer
Philipp was part of the iGEM Team Heidelberg 2008 and since then knows the obvious reason to join the competition again: iGEM simply is the most beautiful competition existing in biology and its mix of constructive creativity and team work guarantees a uniquely inspiring science experience. Philipp's beyond-iGEM scientific interests are in neuroscience and after finishing his bachelor thesis at the Interdisciplinary Centre for Neuroscience at University of Heidelberg, he will start his master studies in Neuroscience. Since Philipp has been mentoring science projects for high school kids for years, he also enjoys the interdisciplinary atmosphere of the Human Practice Projects in science communication in which he's involved.

First and foremost, we would like to thank Professor Dr. Roland Eils for bringing together such a diverse team of students and share not only his vision, but also his resources with us. It is far from usual to put this much trust (and money) into a student research group, and it cannot be overstated how much we appreciate it.
Our greatest thanks go, without any doubt, to Dr. Dirk Grimm. His total devotion and dedication, his patience and his ability to take our project to levels that we couldn't even have dreamt of have helped to bring out the best in each of our experiments.
Without Jens Keienburg none of us would have been part of iGEM or would have ever found our inner dancing abilities (that for some of us were deeply hidden). But he believed in us, even after the first disastrous dancing lessons, and made us into the first iGEM team that would also be able to win any cheerleading competition. To offset the effects of our dancing workout, he fed us with pizza whenever possible.  Of course we are also thankful for all the support and the management of the lab.
We would like thank all of our advisors, who have been a pleasure to work with (although we are not sure they can say the same thing about us), and have been extremely patient with our questions and problems. They were always there for us and even in desperate and laborious times, they stayed with us even if that meant seeing the sunrise from the BioQuant balcony.
PhD Christina Raupp, for helping with the planning and conducting of virus production and in vivo experiments.
Clarissa Liesche, who brought us the joy of ELISA, helped us with the measurements and supplied us with everything from enyzmes to energy drinks. It was also a lot of fun exploring and manipulating the wiki with her.
Subgroup leader Joel Beaudouin, who alwys listened and helped us measuring at the flow cytometer, SP2, SP5, epifluorescence...just every measurement.
Kathleen Börner, for her continuous help and scientific and non-scientific support, she was always there to help us with everything we would ask of her, all along the way.
Marina Bechtle was always ready to help us even on a very short notice without any complaints! Special thanks for her help with the flow cytometry measurements.
Paula Gonzalez, who spent hours and hours on the microscope with us and helped us analyzing the fluorescence of thousands of cells.
Without your help, sacrifice and dedication, we wouldn't be anywhere close to here.
We would also like to thank Eike Kienle for his great help with the constructs, Nina Schuermann for the introduction for the luminometer and advice on the contructs, Stefan Mockenhaupt for his constructs and all groups of the BioQuant who helped us to collect billions of HEK cells in three days, Marlies Muernseer, UniKlinikum Mannheim, for supplying us with Mouse Primary Hepatocytes every Monday and her incredible help.
The modeling subteam would like to thank Dr. Charley Choe for his support, Dr. Rainer König for the nice debate and the suggestion to use neural network, and Nao, Tim and Stephen, from the iGEM 2009 team, whose efforts pointed us in the right direction and give us a nice ground to built on. Thanks to Stephen also for his kind help with the RFCs and part submission.
The website design team would like to thank especially SELFHTML (in German). We wouldn't have been able to create such a wiki, both from the view of graphics and coding, without using this great tutorial glossary. Furthermore, it helped us avoiding many annoying forum trolls who impede any effective search for appropriate problem solutions.
Very much appreciated are, of course, the companies, foundations and the academic sponsors, who believed in our project and sponsored our work.
We have to be thankful to our families, our partners and our friends, who had to put up with our strange work timetables and our non availability during the last four months. Thank you all for understanding what science and iGEM meant to us during all this time and helping us to push through the harder times on our way.
On a strict personal level, and without ever revealing why, we also have to thank:  Nespresso, Ritter Sport (and chocolate in general), Schokakola, the people from Burkina Faso, the dead balloon syndrome, big waterfalls, self-controlled trains, random bacteria who decide to grow up where they shouldn't and contaminate our cell culture, Polish mint-flavoured Vodka, green comfy chairs, table football, explicit hip-hop songs, our mystery coffee buddy, mojitos, tigers, easy-to-strip lab coats, emotional breakdowns in the lab, all of the Harry Potter characters, terrific Mensa food, whoever once forgot to lock the door to the great 7th floor balcony, Bellini...
all of these made iGEM experience... truly unique and unforgettable.
Thank you!!!

    It's always been a great pleasure to share ideas with other iGEM teams and help each other along the way from summer to Jamboree. It's a process that one can inspire and be inspired at the same time. The whole project and the participation in the competition were made much easier and enjoyable with the help and support from them.
    One of the projects of iGEM-Team Tianjin involves the expression of a heterlogous protein in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which is exactly the case for the application of our software Bach. While helping them to optimize the sequence, Bach is practiced, examined and improved in the whole process. It's a great tryout for Bach and an aid for their wet lab experiment as well. We've also consulted them about some wet lab procedures concerning operations of chemostasis, in which they offered much help in solving our problems.
    We've helped the iGEM Team of Bielefeld to translate the main page of their wiki from English to Chinese, so that their work and iGEM competition at the same time can be more accessible to Chinese people.
    We've participated in the iGEM-China meet-up hosted by iGEM team of SJTU-BioX-Shanghai at Aug.8th. Ideas about team's projects and related issues in synthetic biology have been exchanged, which has shaped our thoughts on Bach and made the summer even more memorable.

2010 iGEM Plant Summit
On Sunday November 7th, the iGEM Nevada Team is organizing the first iGEM Plant Summit. The goal of this summit is to develop a network of iGEM investigators working on plant systems that can help promote the adoption of plants by the larger iGEM community. We will discuss the initiation of a coordinated effort to develop iGEM compatible resources (i.e. plant promoters, reporter genes, and transformation vectors) and standardized plant transformation, maintenance and safety protocols. The pros and cons of various plant systems will be discussed. Furthermore, because, genetically engineered plants require more time to create than genetically engineered bacteria or fungi, we will also discuss strategies that will allow for the completion of plant related projects within the time constraint of the iGEM competition.

Graham Cromar
Graham Cromar
I am a 5th year Ph.D. student in the Department of Molecular Structure and Function at the Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto.  At various times in the past I have studied cell and molecular biology (B.Sc. Toronto), molecular biology and genetics (M.Sc. Guelph), computer programming and systems analysis (dip. Inst. Computer Studies, Toronto), bioinformatics (cert. Canadian Genetic Disease Network) and, systems and matrix biology (present).  I have worked as a lab technician, teaching assistant, computer programmer/systems analyst and IS manager.  But, what I would most like to do is what I wrote in my high school yearbook about 20 years ago... Design organisms for export to far away galaxies.  Thanks to iGEM I'm 1/4 of the way there...
Kris Hon
Kris Hon
I am currently a 2nd year masters student in the Department of Biochemistry at the Unviersity of Toronto, having graduated with a BSc. Honours in Molecular Genetics and Microbiology at the University of Toronto.  I am currently studying the effects of micro-compartmentalization in metabolic channeling.  The creative freedom and the chance of making a lasting difference drew me to synthetic biology.  The fact the iGEM allows for both certainly does help!
Amin Zia
Amin Zia
I am a post-doctoral fellow at the Dept. of Cell and Systems Biology with a background in Engineering. I'm currently working on a couple of cool ideas to tailor engineering methods for Bioinformatics and Systems Biology. My interest in synthetic biology comes naturally with my background...

With a B.Sc. Honours Biology and Bioinformatics from the University of Waterloo, Stacy is currently a 4th year Ph.D. student at the University of Toronto.  Her main focus is to identify novel enzyme drug targets against malaria by studying the metabolic networks of these parasites.  She is inspired by anything that is new, exciting, and can have a long-term impact for making the world a better place -- besides her research, iGEM is certainly one of these things!
John Parkinson
John Parkinson
Graduated from the University of Bath with a bachelor of science in Applied Biology in 1990. After receiving a PhD in Biochemistry from the University of Manchester in 1995, I completed a NATO fellowship at the University of Manitoba. From 1997 to 2000, I was awarded a fellowship at the Edinburgh Centre for Protein Technology, University of Edinburgh and from 2000 to 2003 completed another fellowship at the University of Edinburgh on Nematode genomics. I am currently a scientist at The Hospital for Sick Children Research Institute.  The research in our laboratory is aimed at understanding how molecular information can give rise to complex biological behaviour. Using computational methods, we study the organization and dynamics of cellular components within the context of integrated biological systems. Comparative genomics methods are also being applied to provide insights into how these systems may have evolved from the remote origins of life.
Contributions
Graham Cromar, Kris Hon, Anish Kapadia, Elena Pasko and Mengyan Li conceived the project.  Parts were designed by Anish Kapadia, Elena Pasko and Mengyan Li with supervision by Kris Hon.  Computational prediction of metabolic channeling candidates was performed by Kris Hon.  Dynamic simulations on multimeric enzyme assembly were carried out by Danial Wong.  Flux balance analysis and other simulations were carried out by Amin Zia.  Wet lab experiments were carried out by Anish Kapadia, Elena Pasko, Mengyan Li under the guidance of Kris Hon.  Graham Cromar performed additional experiments with the Catechol tolerance assay.  Kris Hon created the encapsulin expression construct and verified its expression.  Kenny Zhan and Yen Leung provided additional assistance with laboratory experiments and parts construction.  Stacy Hung provided assistance with figures and graphics.  Elena Pasko laid out the wiki.  Wiki content was provided by all members of the team.  The team greatly acknowledges John Parkinson who provided research space and materials.

In 2009 we also formed a software team for the first time. Wei Pan, Yuwei Cui, Jiahao Li, Yu He and Xiaomo Yao, guided by Bo Ding, also won a Gold Medal , with the Project ""Automatic Biological Circuit Design (ABCD)"" .
Since last year we have accumulated some experience from the project of Automatic Biological Circuit Design (ABCD), we expect to develop a synthetic biology game this time. The game aims at teaching non-biologists how to design biological systems so that players can compete to improve their designs in order to help biologists create the best engineered machines!

My Profile:
Chen Liao,       Room 418, Key Lab of Quantum Information, CAS, East Campus, USTC Hefei, Anhui 230026, China, liaochen@mail.ustc.edu.cn
I’ve just began my first year in the Optics and Optical Engineering program as a master candidate at University of Science and Technology of China. I became interested in iGEM because I found it a great chance to learn synthetic biology. Since iGEM is a student-run and student-manage programe which encourages students both to work collectively in a team and work individually to complete one's own task, it is a great experience to exercise my team working ability as well as creative ideas. In the last months, especially the summer, I worked with students from different disciplines to design and implement our project together and have learnt a lot from them. It is rather a wonderful experience to work with all team members. (^▽^)
As a student of department of physics, my research area is development of first principle theory and implementation of LCAO (Linear Combination of Atomic Orbitals) algorithms. As a member of LiXin He's group , I have successfully implemented atomic force calculation in LCAO method and my next project is to modify and develop algorithms under condition of  magnetic B field. Besides scientific research, I do sports very often. Basketball is my favorite and my favorite basketball player is Kevin Garnett (K.G.), his professional attitude on the court as well as his individual character in the life impresses me a lot.
Zhen Wang
I am Zhen Wang!
Zhen Wang,       Room 418, Key Lab of Quantum Information, CAS, East Campus, USTC Hefei, Anhui 230026, China.  Email: xqqixp@mail.ustc.edu.cn; wangzhen.ustc@gmail.com;
Hi, I'm Zhen Wang, I mainly work on MoDeL and Database of iGAME. As a member of Lixin He's research group, I focus mainly on calculation of quantum information, quantum correlation and entanglement.
You might have noticed that my address is same as Liao's. Yes, we are from the same Research Group, and the same department, too. It will be boring if I repeat all the information again, so I am going to write some experience of myself participating iGEM2010.
As a student majoring physics, it is hard for me to believe that I can participate in a biology project. Luckily, to my great surprise, these two areas are not so far apart. Modeling and analyzing skills of physics can also be used in biology, and dry project always means a lot of coding task, I can handle that, too. Of course, there is plenty of biology I need to learn, but with the help of our instructor and wet team members, I learn it fast. So I want to tell everyone that there's no limit in iGEM, join in and unleash your power!
Kun Jiang
Email: jkdirac@mail.ustc.edu.cn
I am Kun Jiang, the cheif software developer in iGem 2010 USTC_Software team, responsible for designing the global architecture of our software and  developing the ODE Solver module, Berkley database interface module and several simple tools for teammates.
It is my second year of studying in computer applied technology lab of Institute of Plasma Physics Chinese Academy of Sciences as a master candidate. I am interesting in software engineering and Computer Sicence.  Last year I noticed the recruit advertisement of iGem 2010 USTC_Software team in school BBS website. I make the decision to apply immediately. It's really happy for me during those past server months working with our team.
I play Ping Pong most during my spare time, because Ping Pong is a sport emphasizes on speed, skill and acting harmony ability rather than brute force. And I go jogging every day, which i think is a good way to relieve  pressure and keep me in health!
I want to be a brilliant software engineer developing some brilliant works. I gain strong knowledge in software engineering and computer algorithms. IGEM 2010 is one step to my ambitions, it is a important project but not the last project of my engineering life, I wish I would develop more and more softwares in future. If you need help, do not hesitate to contact me please!

Yubo Qi 3005, national labotarory for physical sciences at the microscape
I am an undergraduate student in theoretical physics. But I am also interested in chemical physics and biology. In my labotarory, I concentrate on the calculation about transmission in nanostructure. However, biology science is also my favourite. So, I decide to join USTC_Software team of iGem 2010. Now I write database of biology reaction for my team. I love biology, chemistry, physics and decide to devote myself to the research of interdisipline in the future.

vicwong@mail.ustc.edu.cn; victorwangluo@gmail.com;
Hey, I'm Vic, an undergraduate senior student majoring in mathematical statistics. Yet my research field is biology statistics, and that is why I'm here.
For IGEM, I'm mainly responsible for human practice and have been giving lectures as well as other promotions on both synthesis biology and IGAM. It is this special experience that has not only made my college life amazing, but also presented me with a broader view of biology. Besides working for IGEM, I've also been researching biology statistics, including bioinformatics and biology networks.
My goal is to be a biostatistician in the future, on which I'm gonna keep putting effort. Now I'm applying for an opportunity to study as a biostatistics PhD. Good luck to me, huh? : )

Email: juewang@mail.ustc.edu.cn
Hi,I am Jue, a Math majored senior student. As the boundaries among different disciplines of science are now blurring, I want to handle the ideology of maths to arrive at a higher standpoint to try to understand the principle of life. iGEM provides us with such a good state to learn from utilization.
In this group, I am the unique girl among nine boys, and the most frequently spoken of mine is ""Oh, it's my duty to get some soy sauce! "" Strange, huh?  The  connotation of it is not words but meanings. Those guys are too gentle to arrange me doing something of coding.So I am more involved in clerical works, I design the team uniform and our logo,arrange the scheduling and get in touch with sponsors and alumni connection. My life is full of unpredictable tasks, who can tell me what is the next?

My profile:
Zhaoyi Li, Hefei National Laboratory for Physical Sciences at Microscale & National Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory, East Campus, USTC Hefei, Anhui 230026, China, lizhaoyi@mail.ustc.edu.cn </p>
During my 2 years’ journey in the nano world, I got to know iGEM and joined in USTC Software team with great honor. Just as NEW YORK TIMES says, iGEM is a Do-It-Yourself Genetic Engineering Program. I am strongly attracted by this idea and cannot help imaging the science fiction picture where our daily life is changed by our genetic machine. It is unforgettable to have a brainstorm with talents from different academic background and turn our imagines into reality. Thanks to iGEM, I experienced a new trip in the synthetic biology and benefited a lot from my partners. Also, to compete against more than 1,000 other students from 100 schools, including many top-flight institutions is exciting.
I love traveling and always enjoy trips with my friends. I have a dream that one day I can travel around the world to discover the great scenery make new friends and experience different culture. Sports is also my favorite, I am good at playing football and gifted in table tennis.

This year 10 students started the iGEM USTC Software team: Chen Liao, Zheng Wang, Kun Jiang, Jue Wang, Luojun Wang, Yubo Qi, Zhaoyi Li, Zhengda He, Shangyu Luo and Mort Yao. There are only 8 of us in the picture, while the only female team member, Jue Wang was in Beijing engaging for her TOEFL exam, and Shangyu Luo had gone to Hong Kong for studying in The University of Hong Kong as an exchange student. What a pity! But they will join us at the iGEM 2010 Jamboree.
USTC has formed two IGEM teams this year, one wet lab team and one dry lab team. As many students majoring in biology was attracted to the wet lab team, our team consists of students from other departments, such as Mathematics, Physics, Computer Science and so on. Thanks to our instructors Hao Jiang and Zhaofeng Luo, with their professional instruction, we are guided to decide the project plan, design and implementation.
About iGEM@USTC
The iGEM Team of USTC are the combination of the exact tradition of USTC and the exact vitality of the young. Rigorous daily schoolwork has provided the team members with a solid foundation of basic knowledge, and an innovative spirit enables us to stand on the frontier of the modern science.
In 2007, Jian Zhan, Bo Ding, Rui Ma, Xiaoyu Ma, Yun Zhao, Ziqing Liu and Xiaofeng Su, guided by Prof. Haiyan Liu, Prof. Jiarui Wu and Prof. Zhonghuai Hou, won the ""Best Foundational Technology Prize"" and a Gold Medal, with the project ""Extensible Logic Circuit in Bacteria"" .
In 2008, Xunyao Wu, He Shen, Genxin Liu, Jia Liu, Binjie Xu, Yanting Xue, Yu Chen, Zhen Xu, Bo Ding and Jian Zhan, guided by Prof. Haiyan Liu, won a Silver Medal , with the project ""Artificial Multi-cellular Self-organization System"" .
In 2009, Hao Jiang, Li Xing, Hao Wu, Zongxiao He, Danqian Liu, Chao Li, Jiayi Dou, Hanyu Lu, Hao Zhou and Bing Wu, guided by Zhaofeng Luo, Jian Zhan, Jiong Hong and Xiaoxiao Ma, won a Gold Medal , with the project ""E. coli Automatic Directed Evolution Machine (E.ADEM)"" .
In 2009 we also formed a software team for the first time. Wei Pan, Yuwei Cui, Jiahao Li, Yu He and Xiaomo Yao, guided by Bo Ding, also won a Gold Medal , with the Project ""Automatic Biological Circuit Design (ABCD)"" .
Since last year we have accumulated some experience from the project of Automatic Biological Circuit Design (ABCD), we expect to develop a synthetic biology game this time. The game aims at teaching non-biologists how to design biological systems so that players can compete to improve their designs in order to help biologists create the best engineered machines!

Team Cooperation
iGEM 2010 China Meetup Shanghai 5/6th Aug, 2010
On August 5th, teams from 7 top universities in China, SJTU-BioX-Shanghai , ECUST-Shanghai , Peking , Tsinghua , USTC & USTC_Software , ZJU-China , and Sun Yat-sen University all gathered in Shanghai and had a nice day at the iGEM 2010 China Meetup.
The meetup started around 9 with a short speech by Professor Lin He, head of Shanghai Jiao Tong University Bio-X Institute, which hosted the event. Then each team made a presentation displaying their projects and progresses since the summer began, followed by free questioning and discussion time. And when it was near the end of the day, student members had a hour or two to talk and play freely with each other, with a big meal waiting ahead for them.

Cooperation with USTC wet team
It's always a good experience working with our wet team through the whole summer. During the process of iGEM 2010, we learn from each other and help each other to achieve more! This year we cooperate with USTC team in modeling and human practice. Read the following sections for more details.
Modeling
This year the team of USTC focuses on the construction a Host-cell-free Reaction Chamber using Synthetic Biology methods. We help them to visualize an artificial organelle of capacity. For more details, please refer to our wet team's modeling page .
Human Practice
This year, we also had close collaboration with USTC wet team on human practice, for the simple reason that none of us is biology major and we had to resort to biology major fellows for professional advice. Besides, we had several activities together; we presented several campus lectures promoting both synthetic biology and IGEM, and we started our IGEM community together. The collaboration with them not only enhanced the quality of our work, but improved the biology knowledge of our own.
iGEM2010 China Meetup Shanghai
Something amazing happened at Shanghai this summer...
Help with surveys
Penn State & Warsaw Team
This year Penn State iGEM team created a survey about Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs) in Agriculture. The survey included questions about where and when GMOs should be used, GMOs containing a lysis device, and other questions dealing with the use of GMOs. USTC Software iGEMers are happy to be participants in the survey, and we wish a good result will come out! We also help team Warsaw fill out their survey forms.

Hi!
I am one of the team-members of Team Stockholm, my name is Nina Schiller and I am a master student in molecular biology at Stockholm University. It is the endless possibilities and opportunities in the field of synthetic biology that has caught my attention to put together our iGEM team: Team Stockholm. To me, this field of research and iGEM competition drives science researchers and students to gain better insight and take advantage of the diverse and powerful characters of living organisms. This summer, I will together with my team mates work our hardest to combine biology, chemistry and engineering in order to understand, harness and imitate the complex phenomena of biological life and finally build innovative and useful biological systems.
My goal with iGEM is to challenge myself to think “out of the box” and seek for ways to put together bits and pieces in science in order to design organisms that would prove useful in the obstacles in modern life. I look forward to build up my science knowledge and laboratory experience. Of course, with a great idea in our luggage, both my and the whole teams goal is to win the iGEM competition!
Andreas Constantinou
andreas (at) igem.se
I first came in contact with synthetic biology in 2008, when I heard about attempts to create a petroleum-producing bacterium to be used as an alternative energy source. Immediately fascinated by this idea and the synthetic biology concept and methodology, my aim has been to study this interesting field ever since. This has now led to the founding of a Stockholm-based team in the 2010 iGEM competition.
What fascinates me most about synthetic biology is that it links biology and engineering together. With a great interest in both, I see iGEM as a unique opportunity for me to combine my creativity and knowledge in molecular biology to design and build a biological machine that can be used in every-day life.
With a revolutionary idea, dedicated and hard-working team-members and a large portion of self-confidence, Team Stockholm is ready to fight for the 2010 iGEM Gold Medal!
See you at the jamboree at MIT in November!
Johan Nordholm

Greetings!
Synthetic biology is all about putting engineering into biology. And I think there is a small engineer hidden in each and every one of us. As with the ever-increasing understanding of how the building blocks of the cell function and are put together, so is our capacity to redesign the building blocks and the way they are put together. This has immense potential, I guarantee it can change our society as much as the computer industry has the last decades. This summer, I will do my best to apply existing biological knowledge to hopefully solve a scientific problem, if even a very small one. I am currently in my third and last year in the bachelor program of molecular biology at Stockholm University. As I have not yet undergone any research traineeship or degree project, my time spent in the lab is limited. I therefore find this project as a tremendous opportunity to change that. What makes this even more fun is that my teammates are some of my best friends.
Emmelie Lidh
Hi!
My name is Mimmi, right now I’m finishing my bachelor in molecular biology.
I have always been fascinated by the origin of life. By how the genetic code can produce so many different life forms and make the organisms adapt to so many different niches and environments. Now, this competition is about using different traits nature invented and put them together to create new useful functions in an organism. I think this is an amazing way to study and learn more about the complex network of genes and at the same time produce a helpful organism.

Hi,
I'm a Masters student in Computational and Systems Biology at Royal Institute of Technology (KTH) and a member of the Stockholm University team for iGEM competition. My first contact with iGEM and synthetic biology wasn't so long time ago. I got introduced to iGEM competitions in 2009. Then Synthetic biology attracted my attention and it became more interesting to me when I started to study about biological circuits and how these circuits are chosen by evolution. Here I will offer all my knowledge and effort to bring our ideas and plans into reality and solve the problem with a great success.

Judging
A self assembling bio-based coating is form, a rigid biofilm .
Expression of hydrophobic proteins called chaplins is induced by the biofilm causing strong surface hydrophobicity.
The strongly hydrophobic biofilm will die off by a killswitch , leaving a nice hydrophobic biological coating.
Self assembling hydrophobic biofilm
We aim to design a biological coating as an alternative to for example chemical coatings. For this we, unconventionally, utilized a Bacillus subtilis biofilm . We wanted to enable our biofilm to be equipped with an interesting property which is automatically initiated. So we introduced an expression trigger which relies on quorum sensing. Our project was directed at finding an alternate solution to biofouling, since regular, chemical coatings which are widely in use pose a threat to the environment. In nature the lotus leaves show self-cleansing properties ascribed to their extreme surface hydrophobicity. In the prokaryotic domain we stumbled upon chaplins , strongly hydrophobic proteins originating from Streptomyces coelicolor. Surface hydrophobicity is a very useful property and is used in many applications ranging from not only antifouling coatings but also other applications which require water repellence to applications in the field of medical sciences. During our project we have contributed to the parts registry whit numerous BioBricks .
We believe that there is a great future for biological coatings as demonstrated within the project. Hydrophobic biological coatings can provide a greener antifouling solution. However using the underlying mechanisms of biofilm triggered expression for other systems like dynamic painting, sensing of environmental changes or even the integration with silicon chips might be within the realm of possibilities. So we challenge coming iGEM teams to further explore and brainstorm about the possibilities of using biofilms as a host for a wide range of applications.
This year a team of young inspired undergraduates from the University of Groningen participated in the amazing challenge of iGEM. A multi-disciplinary team of Molecular Biologists, Chemists, Computer Scientists, Journalists and others spend the summer creating a wonderful project in the emerging field of synthetic biology
Using computer models we worked on the frontiers of knowledge. Gene expression was simulated and a simple explanation for cell differentiation was proposed. Also aiding in ethics and practical feasibility a kill switch system was studied. Finally a new standard was proposed for characterizing Biobrick parts so future can be streamlined.
Because we believe that synthetic biology can better the lives of people and ensure long term prosperity for all humans we spend time educating high school students. But not all is perfect so risks were assessed and we philosophized on the ethical aspects of synthetic biology.

Gaël Chambonnier
Hi! Misses, Mister, E.coli &co. I am in a sabbatical year just before complete my last year of my master degree, so I was fully available for iGEM during the last two months, when everyone was at school or at work.  I enjoy to work in a team and to do different thing like lab work, sponsoring... The overnight work was very funny due to the good mood of the team. We are going to set MIT on fire. So, see you there!! And after this?? Lets go to Australia to see what's going on around Biology !!!!
Carole Rabouille
I am a biochemistry and biotechnology student at insa Lyon currently in my 4th year. I thought that it was a huge opportunity to participate at the iGEM competition! First of all to learn some more about microbiology but also to live a great teamwork experience, a way to exchange with people from all over the world. And finally it is a lot of fun!
Marie-Amédée Galbrun
Like a lot of us, I studied biochemestry and biotechnology at Insa de Lyon. I'm very interessed in Microbiology. I enjoyed my summer at IGEM, the team atmosphere. I'm found of sport especially gymnastic and dance. Happy to be part of this adventure!
Pierre-Yves Zundel
Hey ! I’m learning biochemistry and biotechnology at the INSA, but also salsa, rock and rugby. I’m proud to be part of the first INSA-Lyon iGEM Team for this great adventure ! The iGEM competition offers a fantastic opportunity to work like a laboratory, in a team and in a good mood, and improve our own skills and knowledge. Let’s build a smarter cell together !
Mathilde Guzzo
Student in the fifth year at the INSA Lyon, I am interested in Research and Development in industry. This competition allowed me to do a whole research project from the research of informations to the results presentation. Moreover, I am specialised in Microbiology and Molecular biology. Chassis building, now called Synthetic Biology, is an important tool for the future which has to be controlled. Therefore for me, this project is both a personal and scientific improvement that gathers team work and scientific approach.
Mathilde Arnault
Hey! I’m a student in 4th year, in Biochemistry and Biotechnology! I like skiing and eating the specialities of my region like cheese! IGEM is my first real experience in a team project and the balance sheet is more than positive: new knowledge, team spirit, fun and human relation and it’s not finish, the human adventure go on to Boston with the meeting with students from all around the world!!!
Alban Edouard-Armand
Hey ! I'm a student in BioInformatics and Modelling. It's my first concrete project in synthetic biology but i'm very motivated. Good luck and see you in the jamboree ;)
Mélanie Geffroy
Passionately fond of bacteria and their incredible powers and possibilities, I love creating new useful and fun bacteria! Team work, salsa dancing and cooking are almost as fun!
Anne Chevrel
Hey, I’m a student in biochemistry and biotechnologies. I’m starting the last year of my master degree.
When I heard about my university started  an iGEM team, I directly tought, I want to be part of this adventure !I like the international aspect, the team spirit, the meeting with other students from all over the world and of course I wanted to improve my knowledges and skills in synthetic biology. Without forgetting the fun …!!
Philippe Thomas
Hi! I’m Philippe… But you can call me Felipe! Why? Because I’m in Brazil for 6 months, in Florianopolis (it’s “just” an island, in the south of Brazil, with “just” 40 beaches… Life is hard :D)! But even under the sun, surfing and enjoying the student exchange life, I’m still helping my friends! Because iGEM is a really cool competition:  Science, Fun, Innovation, Friends, Microbiology, International meetings! A really unique experience!  I’m really proud to be a part of this first INSA Lyon iGEM Team! And if you want some surf class, to play guitar around a fire, to have a latino dance, I’m your man! ;) Boston, take care, Lyon is in the place!
Coralie Viollet
I am a 5th yr undergrad student at the National Institute of Applied Sciences (INSA), in Lyon, France. I joined the iGEM INSA team to discover the emerging field of Synthtic Biology. I was mainly involved in the computer-based approach of the project. Outside of the lab, I enjoy playing the piano and driving in the Renault 4L Trophy across the Moroccan desert.
Antonio Freire González
Hi everyone! I am Antonio Freire González and I come from Vigo, the most populated city in Galicia and the biggest fishing port in Europe. I am studying 5th year of Pharmacy in the University of Santiago de Compostela, famous worldwide thanks to its cathedral, where pilgrims from all around the world head to. I made a practice in Lyon this summer so I contacted the team Insa de Lyon and proposed my help for this new IGEM adventure. My passions are waking up Alberto at 6 AM and sleeping in every possible place. I also have other less important hobbies, like playing basketball or geography.

Arnaud Rondelet
Hi everybody ! If you are reading this, there are two possibilities… Either you are lost in this wiki and you don't have anything else to do, or we are interesting people. I like to think that the second choice is the good one. So I am gonna be narcissic and speak about me. I am currently doing a PhD in Microbiology, on a subject that would never interest someone but me. I choose several months ago to join the INSA de Lyon iGEM team as a supervisor. Why ? Because such an experience with motivated and motivating students seemt to be really interesting. What else ? I do not spend all my life in the lab (except during the last two weeks of october 2010, let you guess why). I also like rock music, hiking, travelling around the world and having fun with people.
Soufiane Boumahdi
As a student in biochemistry engineering at INSA, I first heard of Igem in 2007, when Endy Drew, Igem's founder came at INSA to promote this new competition in Europe. After two years thinking of this idea, I finally decided to join Igem Paris team in 2009 to enjoy this competition within an experienced team. Convinced that biochemistry department at INSA had the perfect tools to participate this competition, mixing together an engineering background with strong microbiological and bio informatics knowledge, I helped the emergence of a new team and tried to share my experience of the competition with all the team members
Axel Cournac
I defended a Ph.D in the speciality of Interface between Physics and Biology in 2009.  I am currently working with bacteria on gene regulation.  Thanks to our sponsors for this very cool adventure especially Speed Burger.
Nathalie Isorce
I'm 24 years old. I’ve just finished the French INSA School in Biochemistry and Biotechnology. I‘m doing a master degree, in order to do a PhD about Hepatitis B Virus. I like climbing, skiing, travelling, drinking Belgian beers, going to music concerts, watching Tim Burton’s films and reading Amélie Nothomb’s books. Finally, I hoped that iGEM competition would give me many opportunities: working with various people (done!!), reflecting about an unusual subject, understanding a new concept (under construction as our wiki!!) and above all meeting international people (soon, at the Jamboree!).
Philippe Lejeune
Hi, I am the director of the department of Biosciences of INSA Lyon. I like genetics, genetic engineering, and their historical aspects. Also taking photographs, using Photoshop and traveling. As a belgian citizen I particularly enjoy the marvelous country where I live, France : I am crazy about french culture, literature, landscapes, cities, gastronomy and wines...

Discover Lyon
Lyon is one of the  most important city of France with almost half a million of inhabitants and a superficy of 50 km². It's also the second touristic city after Paris with 6 millions of tourists every year. It is the capital of Rhone (department) and the Rhone Alpes (region).
The first real town in this area was found in 43 BC. The strategic location permitted the expanse of the town and it became the capital of the empire of Gaule in 27 BC.  Today a great area of the city is listed in the world heritage of UNESCO, like the old town, Fourvière, Croix Rousse among others.
The old town has a lot of renaissance and medieval constructions. The traboules, which are the connections between the small medieval streets, were helpful during the second world war because they permitted the resistance to escape from the gestapo.They look likes some secret passages. The roman town (Lugdunum) were on the Fourvière hill. Today you can see the antic theater and the Odeon.
A basilica was built on the former forum of Lugdunum and named Notre dame de Fourvière. It's dedicated to the immaculate conception. It is one of  the most visible building of the city. The two important places in the peninsula are the Terreaux place and the Bellecour place.The banks of the Rhone are designed and a lot of bars can be found on barges.
Some other important buildings and places :
La part dieu : it's a big tower whose nickname is the ""pencil Tower"". It is 165 m high. It is the biggest commercial center build in a city in Europe. You can enjoy almost 250 shops.
Some old buildings like the Brotteaux train station
The park La tete d'or :  it's a park of 117 ha in the north area of the city. It opened in 1857. Today it is a place where people go for walking, running, ride roller, biking, rest,... There is a zoological park, a velodrome, rosary and a botanic garden. It's located next to the campus of la Doua and the INSA.
All this places are enhanced during the “Fête des lumières” (the festival of Lights), during the week of the 8th December. In the religious history it is the date of the immaculate conception and then in 1854 the inauguration of the statue of Marie. This statue was erected in order to protect the city from the plague. At the end of the XIXème century, it became an important touristic event with millions of people coming every year. The tradition is to put a small candle (called ""lumignon"") on the window of your home. The buildings are illuminated and there are some light animations in the strategic places of the city. This event has an international reputation. Some other important events : in September the dance biennial and the contemporary art biennial.
Lyon and its region are also known as a gastronomic area : there are a lot of great chef like Paul Bocuse and Eugénie Brazier. The specialties of the city are the quenelle,  the rosette (sausage), the ""salade lyonnaise"" (lettuce whith bacon, crouton and poached egg), … You can enjoy this dish in the Bouchon lyonnais, typical restaurants, disseminated among the city. The Rhone-Alpes region is also known for the cheese (tome de Savoie, reblochon, Mont d'or,...) and the wine (Beaujolais, Côte du Rhone).
Lyon had also played a great part in the history of cinema and photography thanks to  the Lumière Brothers. August and Louis Lumière were among the earlier filmmakers in the history. In 1895, they projected their first short motion pictures, including their famous first film :“ Workers leaving the Lumieres factory”. Each film runs less than a minute, which represents a 17 meter long reel. They developed the device called cinematograph which allows the record, development and projection of motion pictures.Today, you can visit the Lumiere Institute which is located  in the brothers’ old house.

The INSA !
INSA : Institut National des Sciences Appliquées, which means National Institute for Applied Sciences. It's a network of five after-Baccalauréat (french “A” level) engineering schools. They are located in five important french cities : Lyon, Renne, Toulouse, Rouen and Strasbourg. Today, there are almost 52,000 engineers who were trained by INSA. The proposed specializations are very various : about chemistry, mechanics, civil, electric, and material engineering among others. They are public engineering schools.
INSA engineering school of Lyon is the oldest INSA. Its construction was quick and the courses started at the end of 1957. The first buildings were on a swamp. Then, the swamp has been gradually constructed with new buildings for room classes, accommodations and research laboratories. Today, INSA Lyon set 12 different specializations after the 2 years of preparation classes.
The Student life is an important part of the school after classes. There are more than one hundred student associations. The students organize a lot of events like the Raid, the 24 hours of INSA,...Then, people can acquire scientific skills but also humans skills in order to become a complete engineer.
Students with a high level in sports can enjoy rearranged timetables so they can go on with it. Next to the scientific education, other students choose to follow music, art, danse or theatre classes. The international opening is not neglected either: there are four international sections during the two first years of preparation. Those special sections welcome students from all around the world :
Amerinsa (for the latino american area),
Asinsa (for the asian area),
Eurinsa (for the european area)
SCAN (most of classes are taught in english).
There is about 30% of international students.
Our speciality: Biosciences, our departement is divided in two sections Biochemistry and Biotechnologies engineering, and Bioinformatics and Modelisation engineering. At the end of the five years in our school,  we graduate with a master of engineering in Biosciences.
It is one of the youngest department of the school and the smallest, less than 200 students. It has been created at the request of Charles Mérieux then president of the Biomerieux company, an important biochemical industry originally from Lyon. Moreover, Biomerieux is for this year our most important sponsor for the iGEM competition via the INSA Foundation Biomerieux.

The iGEM 2010 INSA-Lyon Team !
See more about the students and the supervisors
This year Pr Lejeune, head of department and professor of microbiology, had floated the idea of the participation at the IGEM competition. Then a group of students from third, fourth and fifth years (us !!) motivated themselves and wanted to be part of the iGEM adventure.
Why  we like iGEM  competition:
The international aspect: this is an international competition and moreover some of our teammates are abroad for a semester in exchange. Then we run the project from different parts of the globe. There is also Antonio, a spanish student doing an internship in Lyon, who wanted to be part of our project
The meeting with other international students: We want to meet new people with a mutual interest for synthetic biology, but we also want discover all their other interests and create contacts all around the world. We want also share our ideas and way of living.
The research project in synthetic biology: a way to materialize our courses and keep learning by a different way than books.
The idea melting: how to run a project an go on with the ideas of the team members and realize them.
The team atmosphere: We didn’t know each other very well before this adventure and we are, now, a real team with a strong  cohesion, ready to share discoveries and works and even more fun...
The IGEM competition is an event which corresponds to the INSA international logic. It's an occasion to push for INSA engineering school through the world and mostly to meet up with other students who share a same subject of predilection.
It was also an occasion for us to really have a mix between students of several years around a same work. In fact the human experience begin before the jamboree because of the group work and will continue at the jamboree in early November.
All of us didn't work in Lyon because a small part of the group begin an exchange semester in September in different university abroad. A Spanish student from Barcelona also joined the team, while he was doing an internship during this summer at Lyon.
We are involved for the first time in this international competition, but we'll do our best ! Our lab is located in the Biosciences Department, in the National Institute of Applied Sciences (INSA) of Lyon. Nice place and great city ! We invite you to discover it and share our everyday life thanks to the links on your left.
Meet us with the links Students or Supervisors. You can also have a look on our nice (or not !) photos of our adventure with the Gallery link. More photos are coming soon !

Let me guide you
UNDERGRADUATES
Camille Bernard
Camille has begun her cursus by studying chemistry, physics and mathematics in Classe Prépa. Then she decided to enter in a biotechnology school (ESBS) in Strasbourg because she was keen to learn how the living works. She was interested in taking part of this experience insofar as it is a chance to lead a project since the beginning, from the idea to the culmination. Furthermore it was the opportunity to work with a motivated team and to test our limits. Besides, Camille loves Morgane’s cake; it is the best ATP source in the world!!
Fabian Stiefel
Fabian is now in the ninth semester and so at his last year as student at the Ecole supérieure de Biotechnology de Strasbourg (ESBS). Before he entered the ESBS he studied two years of chemistry at the University of Freiburg, Germany. The idea of trilingual courses in four Universities in three different countries was and is very thrilling to him. He is very fond of synthetic biology and he wants to continue in this domain of research for his diploma/ master thesis. He finds it also very exciting to work with a highly motivated team on a self chosen project for the summer.
Three weeks before the jamboree he had discovered a great new game - the blender animation program. Since then, when he haves time, he unleashes his new skills on the innocent ClpXP protease and his friends, stretching and bending them into models and pictures and forcing them to move.
Georgio Kourjian
Georgio joined the Ecole supérieure de Biotechnology de Strasbourg (ESBS) after he got his B.Sc degree in Biochemistry at the University of the Mediterranean in Marseille France. Currently he is in the last year of the master’s program in this trinational Biotechnology school. He was interested about synthetic biology and the idea of designing and building new biological functions and systems not found in nature that is why he joined the ESBS iGEM team. He thinks that participating at the iGEM competition is a very enriching experience.
For him diploma thesis a part of his work will be the use of synthetic biology for medical purposes.
He was mainly responsible of the wiki creation.
Jens-Sebastian Kalchschmidt
Jens is in his last year as student at the Ecole supérieure de Biotechnology de Strasbourg (ESBS). Before he enrolled in the ESBS he studied 2 years molecular biotechnology at the University of Heidelberg, Germany. He decided to take the chance to continue his biotechnology studies within the trilingual study course biotechnology at the ESBS implicating four universities in three countries. In retrospect, he must say that it was absolutely the right choice and the first long-term contact with the international research community. His research interests focus mostly on immunology and infectious diseases, but the iGEM participation sparked his interest in synthetic biology.
Personal remark: Marathon preparation can be best done during incubation times.
Morgane Griesbeck
Morgane did her cursus in the so-called « classes préparatoires » where she studied Mathematics, Physcis and Chemistry. She chose then to study Biotechnology, choice she has never regretted. She was very interested in the experience provided by conducting a project from scratch. She was especially attracted by the interdisciplinary aspect of synthetic biology and the juncture of biology and engineering. Besides, Morgane loves chocolate and did amazing chocolate cakes called « Indémoulable de Jean-François ».
Pierre Dillard
Pierre is currently in his ninth semester at the ESBS. Previously he has done two years in CPGE BCPST where he received a good education in mathematics, physics, chemistry and biology. In the ESBS he specialized himself in synthetic biology because he think that this field can be the future of the biology. iGEM was a seducing project for him because of the intellectual challenge and the team work. To see the evolves of the project all summer long was very grateful. He enjoys also all the new skills acquired during this work.
Raphaël Doineau
Raphael is just like the other in his ninth semester at the ESBS. Originally from a math physics and chemistry curriculum he chose the ESBS for his international orientation and the synthetic biology approach of biotechnology. In order to obtain further biological background knowledge and skills, he decided to interrupt his curriculum to perform two six months internships in two different labs before continuing ESBS and joining the iGEM team.
Renaud Renault
Also known as Reno carré (Reno square) he tends to be famous for his experiments on the lack of sleep on himself. As some of his fellows, he is in the third year of ESBS, after having intensively studied Maths, Physics, Biology, Chemistry, and even more for 2 years in Classe Prépa. Since that time, he has  been a MATLAB freak, coding some cool stuff you can see on his youtube channel (for instance http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm0qQlzh0hw ) and earns his living (sushis are quite expensive) by doing clinical trials. He got interested in Synthetic Biology quite early, and more especially with the iGEM competition. He originally got the idea of engineering a controllable protease which was the basis of our project and is really glad that others were as excited and motivated about it as him.
Sebastien Pigeot
Sébastien decided to study biology after obtaining his A level. He studied for two years in a special school combining half practical courses and half theoretical courses. After completing those two years he decided to travel and did a Bachelor in Science at the Heriot Watt University, Edinburgh. Finally, he returned to France to Strasbourg and joined the ESBS (Ecole Supérieure de Biotechnologie de Strasbourg). He discovered a tri-national school with a great atmosphere and he is really enjoying it. He decided to take part to the igem competition with some of his friends because it is a very challenging competition and he was attracted by the fact to be autonomous toward the reflection and the manipulations. So far he has not been deceived in his expectations.
Thea Ziegler
Thea started her studies at the Humboldt University Berlin with the Bachelor program of Biophysics. As the trinational conception and organization of the ESBS captivated her, she left the German capital after finishing the 4th semester and went to Strasbourg to continue with the diploma course in Biotechnology. In the current last year of her studies she decided to specialize in Synthetic Biology and to take part of the iGEM competition. Behind the basic idea of iGEM she was attracted by the opportunity to work independently without limitations in creativity. She is very satisfied with the theme her team chose, the role and functioning of photoreceptors fascinate her since the early beginning of her studies. In the future she wants to continue within this field.
Yohann Lacotte
Yohann had pretty much the same curriculum than his copartners coming from ""Classe Prépa"". He is particularly interested in neurophysiology, biophysics and of course, synthetic biology.
He likes to go to movie theatre, draw some manga and sing in the  shower, but not at the same time natürlich. Although he really enjoys watching some cartoons on TV before his daily nap, he can also be a  brutal extrem lab worker all day AND night long. Unfortunately for us, his good mood is proportional to the success rate of his experiments,  but once he decided to succeed, he can manage the impossible. Within  iGEM, he thus can be seen as the man of the situation, as far as clearing the hurdles is concerned.
Yves Gendrault
After obtaining his bachelor's degree in Electronique, Signaux et Automatique (ESA), Yves does a Master’s degree in Micro-and Nano-Electronique (MNE) at the Université de Strasbourg (UdS). He discovers the field of Synthetic Biology during an internship in the Institut d'Electronique du Solide et des Systèmes (InESS) laboratory in Strasbourg. During this internship he creates models for several biological processes. Because Synthetic Biology is situated between engineer sciences and biotechnologies, the collaboration with biotechnologists is for him fundamental for a better understanding. He thinks that the iGEM competition is a very interesting experience of this kind of collaboration in an international team.
ADVISORS
Pr. Jacques Haiech
Jacques Haiech got a M.D. degree in Mathematics and computer science in 1975 and then a M.D. and a PhD degree in Biochemistry in 1978 dealing with cell signaling (focusing on calcium signal in muscle cells). After his PhD, he has been working part time successively at NCI in Bethesda, then at Vanderbilt University and finally at Northwestern University (Chicago) while being research director at Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique in France, studiyng cellular calcium signals before joining the Strasbourg University as a full professor in 1997. He has founded the first synthetic biology option in an engineering school in France in 2008 along with the first participation of the ESBS-Team to the iGEM competition. Since then, he has developed collaboration with the Strasbourg engineering school of physics on “Design Methodology and Modeling of Synthetic Biosystems”. He is now working in integrating concepts of synthetic biology in personalized medicine.
INSTRUCTORS
Dr. Maria Zeniou
Maria Zeniou graduated as a molecular biologist in 2002. Her PhD project included genetic studies of an X-linked inherited disorder and functional studies on the protein kinase whose loss of function leads to this disease. After her PhD, she performed a four-year post-doc in molecular and cellular biology. Within this period, she studied the roles and the regulation of lipid modifying enzymes during the process of regulated hormone exocytosis from neuroendocrine cells. In 2007, she joined the Strasbourg University as an assistant professor and since 2008 she participates to the iGEM teams of the Ecole Supérieure de Biotechnology de Strasbourg (ESBS) as an instructor. The aim of her current research project is to better understand the physiopathology of gliomas.
Pr. Christophe Lallement
Christophe Lallement received the M.S. degree in engineering from the Science University of Nancy I, Nancy, France, and the Ph.D. degree in engineering from the École Nationale Supérieure des Télecommunications, Paris, France.

ESBS - Biotech School
ESBS - Ecole Superieure de Biotechnologie de Strasbourg
The three-year curriculum in Biotechnology is organized by the “Upper Rhine Universities” in Freiburg, Basel, Karlsruhe and Strasbourg. Students from France, Germany and Switzerland receive an interdisciplinary and intensive, trilingual education in biotechnology.  Most of the lectures take place at the École Supérieure de Biotechnologie de Strasbourg (ESBS) in Strasbourg. Intensive laboratory courses and internships are offered by the universities Basel, Freiburg and Karlsruhe.The languages for lectures and exams are French, German and English.  Students for this program are selected after successful completion of two years of undergraduate education in sciences or engineering at a university or an equivalent institution.The degree obtained in this program is completed within 6 semesters. Each of the four partner universities is responsible for part of the program, according to their special strengths in research, resulting in a diverse program covering a wide spectrum of current research. All aspects of biotechnology are covered, from molecular biology to microbiology, bioprocess engineering and biocomputing. Lectures in patent law, economics and professional language courses complete the program. In the third year, students can focus on specialized areas, such as bioproduction or bioinformatics.
THE UNIVERSITY OF STRASBOURG
European by nature and international by design, the University's strengths and assets stem from its active involvement in virtually every discipline comprising the current body of knowledge. As a young university founded on an age-old tradition, it strives to attain cross-disciplinarity so that this mixing fosters new research opportunities and produces courses that meet society's need. The international dimension is fundamental for the University of Strasbourg and thanks to the world wide reputation of its research teams, built on excellence and efficiency, it emerges among Europe's foremost research universities. Each of the University's main academic fields of instruction is based upon research sections that are the driving force of the institution, with over  2,600 professors and 2,000 staff. The Technology Transfer Office, one of the very first developed in a French university, strives to promote the work of the researchers and facilitate partnerships with economic and institutional stakeholders. An essential player in the promotion of scientific and technical culture, the University interfaces with its host city, Strasbourg.  Solidly anchored in the European Higher Education Area, the University of Strasbourg, a beating heart of the Alsatian metropolis with its 41,000 students, has the potential to face the challenging international competition.
Collaboration
We set up a collaboration with the iGEM 2010 Team Freiburg_Bioware , they provided us with the YFP and CFP assembled biobricks cloned into standard pSB1C3 backbone.
We visited the Freiburg Team at their lab. Both teams made a presentation of their project and gave some ideas and impressions about the project and iGEM in general.
After the serious part, we enjoyed together a nice barbecue on the roof of the University of Freiburg.

Ng Siu Yan, Trista
I am Trista. I was born in HK. I am a year 3 student studying Biotechnology and Microbiology. I like watching movies and reading leisure books. It is a special experience to participate in the iGEM competition. In my team, I am responsible for the investigation of the project and what I have to do are the practical parts. My team members and I are actually having a great time in the lab. I enjoy the time when we are working together. It is a valuable chance to work with them. I am so happy working with my nice partners.
Salma Jalal
Hi, I am going into my second year of undergraduate studies majoring in Biomedical Engineering. I applied to iGEM in an attempt to broaden my knowledge of not only theoretical but also practical Biochemistry, since previously I have only enrolled in one elementary course in the subject. Having had no previous lab experience, I have made my share of mistakes in the lab, but it is all worth the relief and pride you feel when an experiment finally gives you the result you want. I am really happy to have been given the chance to be a private investigator and to work with the most wonderful teammates.
Tse Kung Ki, Quatre
Hi! This is Quatre. I am a Year 3 undergraduate student at HKU doing Chemistry and Finance. iGEM provides me a valuable experience in synthetic biology, which I have never heard of before. I pretty enjoy the time I spent on iGEM, the laboratory work, the human practices and video shooting. iGEM is indeed a very nice competition and I am looking forward to seeing you guys at MIT this November!!
He Peng, Brian
I'm a Year 2 student studying Biochemistry as my major with Statistics and Computer science as my two minors. You may wonder why I study such a combination of subjects. The reason is that I think a good scientist should have the ability to see the nature behind large amounts of data and explain a phenomenon quantitatively and precisely, therefore I try to get myself armed with the knowledge of Statistics and Computer science. In our HKU iGEM team, I mainly work as one of the seven principal investigators to connect theory to practice. It's really fun to spend time in lab day and night seeking for the secrets of synthetic biology. And it is iGEM competition that lets me enjoy the joys of teamwork and learn to overcome hardships in research.
Hui Wai Wai, Nadia
I am a sophomore accounting and finance major in the business school with a minor in biochemistry. You might wonder why a business student would be interested in pure science research work and how I can be of help. What fascinate me are the boundless possibilities that exist in genetic engineering, and how iGEM makes it possible to gather brilliant ideas from all around the globe. Indeed, it takes me some efforts to catch up with the lab techniques. But with the support from my team members, everything is so much easier. I have to express my gratitude to the team leaders that trusted my ability and I am proud to be part of the team. With everyone’s efforts, our research is progressing well, and we will work together to make our idea of suicide gene possible. May I wish iGEM 2010 a success.
Tsui Wai Man, Cindy (acting artistic director)
“To be or not to be, that’s the question.”- Shakespeare.
I am Cindy, one of the principal investigators of the team this year; I also work on the wiki& art as a novice :P. Joining the iGEM team as a year III chemistry student is quite a big decision for me. Biochemistry, despite its verbal relation to chemistry, is a novel subject to me. Decided to make the best of my final year in the university, I explore more in other aspects other than my own major- engaging in this project and doing psychology are two of them. I am certain that devotion to the project would be an thought-provoking experience.
Chan Kit Yu, Ako
Hi everybody, I am Ako. I am a Year two undergraduate of the science curriculum in the University of Hong Kong, taking biochemistry as major subject and chemistry as minor subject. I like playing basketball in leisure time and I do play in teams as well.
I joined the iGEM competition since I hope I will be capable to handle and, at least, acknowledge some background information of those skillful techniques useful in the biochemistry laboratories.
Ip Pui Kan, Kan
Hello guys. I am Kan. I am a Year 3 student majoring in biochemistry. I particularly like the environment and I believe that we, human, by making good use of knowledge in biology, can live with the Mother Nature harmoniously. I like playing hockey and soccer. Manchester United is my favorite team. The States is a great place. I can’t wait to visit one of the most famous universities in the world.
Human Practices:
Leung Man Hong, George
I am Leung Man Hong, George, a biochemistry student from HKU. In this year, I would like to explore the world of synthetic biology and use the power of genetic engineering to make some advancement in human living. We are going to design a Bio-safety Net so as to minimize the harmful effect of some human activities to the environment. I hope that we will succeed and try to make a step to do something for our home, The Earth, as a scientist.

SHI Yuan, Sean
Hi, I'm Sean, nice to join iGEM! I'm a maths & physics major student and I also minor chemistry. I'm fancinated by creatures living around, and I'm surprised by our ability to manipulate them. Simple as bacteria, they can already have complicated functions that cooperate extremely well. I join HKU team as a modeling guy. Providing an understanding from another perspective, I believe I can contribute to make us the best team!

Where we're from
Virginia United is a regional team between Virginia Tech, University of Virginia, Virginia Commonwealth University, Bluefield State College, and Virginia State University. The team members spent their summer spread between labs at Virginia Tech, University of Virginia, and Virginia Commonwealth University working towards a common project.
Regional Team
The Virginia United Team was created as a collaborative effort between five schools, University of Virginia, Virginia Commonwealth University, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University (Virginia Tech), Bluefield State College, and Virginia State University. We divided up and worked on separate parts of the project in three different locations in the state and maintained communication through constant emails, Skype calls, and face to face regional meetings.  Collaboration for a project of this magnitude with this many people was in itself an experimental endeavor that challenged us to develop a project and maintain strong communication and organizational skills that are vital to the interdisciplinary component of synthetic biology.  Not only did each individual offer a unique perspective to the team, but each university, based on access to variable resources and instruments, provided different approaches and angles to completing our project.  Perhaps one of the most vital components of this project was learning how to work together as a team in a research environment.  Having gained a better understanding of how research can be conducted in a multi-institutional setting has provided us with an experience that will be instrumental for development of our futures in research and beyond.  As collaborative efforts between universities, states, and even countries becomes a normal part of the research world, our team members are now better equipped to handle and solve future scientific problems.
Collaborations with Other Teams
We helped the software team create a program that can analyze a construct's DNA sequence and design oligo primers that can be used for USER fusion.  Our team helped by explaining how USER fusion works, explaining optimal length of primers, and explaining optimal melting temperatures for the primers.  USER fusion is a method for splicing together long strands of DNA and is convenient for construct assembly.
VA United Boot Camp
In order to become acquainted with the members of each sub team, the Virginia United team held a ""boot camp"" at the beginning of the summer starting June 1 and ending on June 4.  In addition to getting to know one another the team also discussed an overview of our project.  To bring each team member up to speed in the field of synthetic biology, daily laboratory projects were planned including construct assembly, screening, and analysis.  Each day, guest speakers, including advisors from each institution, lectured on important points in the growing field of synthetic biology and instilled excitement in all the students.  The FBI visited the Virginia United students to lecture on safety and discretion while participating in research and provided a workshop to help conceptualize their lecture’s importance.  In summary, the boot camp provided an exciting environment for team bonding and offered an environment conducive for thinking and learning.

Assembling
The goal is to assemble a simple device using BioBricks. Since we only have 1 week, the BioBrick parts have already been transformed and grown on plates. During the week, students will start liquid cultures for each part, miniprep the plasmids, digest the plasmids, ligate the digested DNA, transform the assembled device, grow the new cells, and measure their results.
The device contains three BioBrick parts: a TetR generator (BBa_I732084), a Ptet controlled GFP (BBa_I13522), and a vector expressing RFP (BBa_J04450). The TetR generator expresses the TetR transcription factor, which represses the Ptet promoter. The inducer aTc can be added to the growth media and block TetR from repressing the Ptet promoter. Thus, the Ptet controlled GFP will show a response in GFP level based on the presence or absence of aTc. The RFP expressing vector provides a positive control for the assembly because those vectors that do not properly digest can be identified by their expression of RFP, which can be seen by eye.

Not only did we have the opportunity to meet all the team members at the boot camp, but we also learned a lot of important elements that helped us throughout the summer.  Each speaker helped us understand a different aspect of the field, and each day we worked in the lab we became more familiar with the techniques that we were using throughout the summer.

Collaborators
Over the past six months we have collaborated with a lot of people. On this page you will find a list of the people who have helped us and whom we have helped.
The Bielefeldt team - visited us from September 24th to 26th, where we presented our projects to each other. We have sent our ninaB coding sequence (retinal generator) to the Bielefeld team and they have sent us their Lac promoter to be characterized .
The DTU-Denmark team - We visited the DTU team on October 9th where we presented our projects and commented on the power point presentations so that they can be fine-tuned for the jamboree.
The Warsaw team we helped the Warsaw team filling in the inquiry form concerning generale iGEM team questions.
Unisensor A/S - We have been working together with Unisensor A/S for characterizing our photosensor part. At unisensor they are developing a machine that is able to track many microscopic particles in a liquid, which means it is well suited for motility analysis on bacteria. The Thor prototype is able to follow a large amount of microbes at the same time, which makes the results more statistically viable than traditional cell tracking tools. For data analysis we use the unify software, which analyses the videos from the thor prototype and outputs data like: speed, force, path and tumbling frequency of the bacteria. In return we give them feedback in regards to usability and application of their machines and software.
Pictures from the Bielefeld visit
They came bearing gifts!
After the presentations we took the German guys for a tour of Odense

Advisors
This site is dedicated to our advisors, who have helped us a lot during the entire project.
Ann Zahle Andersen
I am a post.doc at the microbiology group of the department of biochemistry and molecular biology at SDU. I have a past in systems biology and mathematical modeling, but am currently researching in the field of food microbiology.
I was introduced to the iGEM team in May and immediately saw great potential. Therefore I am truly honored to be an instructor on their project and look forward to lots of fun and good science over the summer.
Martin Hanczyc
This is my second year participating as an advisor for the SDU iGEM team.  I am very pleased to see growing interest in the students who seek to educate themselves in this new field of synthetic biology.  And their initiative in pursuing high-risk projects warms my heart.  I am so pleased with the degree of success they have achieved due to their hard work, creativity and relentless determination.  I think I have learned more from their example then they have learned from me.    As an associate professor at SDU, I am primarily interested in developing laboratory models of complex systems that have life like properties.  This is done through my participation in the research center called FLinT (fundamental living technology).  Currently my research lies in physics and chemistry, but my interests are based in biology and evolution.
Jakob Møller-Jensen
Associate Professor, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Southern Denmark.  I am interested in the molecular mechanisms by which pathogenic strains of Escherichia coli cause disease. In my group, we aim to identify bacterial virulence factors and further characterize the molecular cross-talk taking place at the host-pathogen interface during infection. In this framework the C. elegans model organism is used extensively for both genetic and proteomic analyses of bacterial infection.  As a supporter throughout the summer I have become truly impressed by the SDU iGEM team enthusiasm and genuine interest in science. They really make things happen, both in the lab and outside!
Julian C. Shillcock
Associate Professor, Department of physics and chemistry, University of Southern Denmark. The aim of my research is to construct a computational model of a living cell that has predictive power for problems of biological interest on length and time scales of microns and milliseconds to seconds.  This includes biophysical processes such as:
•   Optimizing a drug delivery vehicle for delivering its payload to membrane-bound receptors
•   Signal transduction from the plasma membrane to the nucleus via motor-assisted transport vesicles
•   Pattern formation of receptors in the cell membrane
•   Sensitivity analysis of signalling networks in the presence of nanoparticles
•   Nanoparticles interacting with the plasma membrane
•   Engulfment of foreign objects into a cell
The techniques I use are particle-based simulation methods such as Dissipative Particle Dynamics, Brownian dynamics, Molecular Dynamics, and theoretical tools such as reaction-diffusion equations, non-linear differential equations.
Instructors
Janni Vester Bjerrum
I am doing my master thesis with Jakob Møller-Jensen in the microbiology group of the department of biochemistry and molecular biology at SDU in Odense.
My research is focused on discovering sRNA’s from the pathogenic adherent-invasive E. coli involved in Crohn’s disease in order to identify the ones that are involved in bacterial virulence. I work with the nematode C. elegans as a modelorganism for the human gastrointestinal tract.
I was introduced to iGEM as the 2009 SDU team was my lab neighbour which I bitched and moaned about because they were jabbering, taking up all the lab space and “borrowing” my stuff without returning it. I guess I was asked to be part of the iGEM this year so that I could no longer bitch and moan but rather be responsible for the team's interplay with the other people in the lab. Jokes aside, I hope to bring knowledge and lab experience to the team and I am very excited about working with this very diverse group of people and look forward to all the science we are going to make and all the fun we are going to have, although there has been a serious lack of cake!
Mike Stein Barnkob
It's been fun to be an advisor for the 2010 SDU-Denmark iGEM team. I participated as a student in 2009, and am glad to have been able to help this years team.
When I am not busy working on the iGEM project, I spend time studying medicine, playing with LEGOs and curing cancer.
Kir Jacobsen
I am presently working on my master thesis in biochemistry and molecular biology. My thesis is concerning methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus and new possible treatments counteracting widespread antibiotic resistance.
I also participated in last year's iGEM competition on team SDU-Denmark. This year, I'm back as an instructor which has been exactly as much fun as being a student. I wish my team all the best during the competition.
Rafal Wieczorek
I'm a PhD student at SDU Department of Physics and Chemistry. I remember from my younger years when I was a master student in biotechnology taht I read about the iGEM competition and wishing to be a part of it. Unfortunately, at that time there was no team at my university. I see now that participating in the iGEM competition as an advisor is just as exciting as being an iGEM student.
Laboratories
All of our experiments were carried out in the laboratories of

Students
This year's team consists of twelve students from the fields of biochemistry and molecular biology, medicine, biomedicine, physics, chemistry and philosophy!
During the summer we have been split up into five subgroups, three labgroups and two theoretical groups. One labgroup has been working with the development of the photosensor, one with hyperflagellating the bacteria and one with creating the retinal generator. The two theoretical groups have been focusing on modelling and biosafety, respectively.
As is obvious below, we are unable to coordinate something as simple as T-shirt color. Somehow though, we managed to get succesfully through an entire iGEM project.
Christian
Christian is a 23 year old medical student on his second year. He has been happy to get away from the books and try something new, completely out of his element. This has proved very amusing for the rest of us, seeing as he (and the other medical student, Lars Christian) had no lab experience when we started. Over the summer, however, he has learnt fast and has proven a valuable member of the team. His main interests are in neurology and cognitive development, but the thought of tinkering with E. coli and fruitfly DNA was enough to get him out of his comfort zone. His work in the iGEM competition has primarily been focused on creating the retinal part, but he has never missed a chance to involve himself in other aspects of the project. Nosy guy.
Eddi
Eddi is 22 years old and is studying physics on his fourth year. He has done a great job modelling the system together with Glenn.
When Eddi isn't working on iGEM, he spends a lot of time with his girlfriend. He is a very caring boyfriend and they live together in a small house. Eddi reads a lot and is very engaged in his studies. He impressed us all by studying on the bus all the way to Paris (16 hours) when we went to the European iGEM workshop.
Glenn
Glenn is 24 years old and studies physics on his fourth year. He is one of the modelling guys and he and Eddi have done an incredible job batteling the math that wouldn't allow our system to exist.
Glenn has a fantastic ability to convey really complicated information in a way that makes it sound interesting and relevant. No matter how tired or hungover we were at our weekly update meetings, we always woke up and paid attention when Glenn spoke. He is an excellent presenter and is always enthusiastic and truly catches his audience.
Glenn is always very busy but he still has a big smile on his face, even when he's frustrated. We would love to illustrate the correlation between his level of excitement and the number of hand gestures per minute, but the only one who knows how to do the math is probably Glenn himself.
Lars Christian
Lars Christian is 21 years old and one of our medical students. Originally, his lack of lab experience caused him to take the position of Maria's lab bitch. Over the summer, though, he has learned fast during his work with the photosensor part and is now ready to spread his wings and fly out into the world as a real boy.
Despite his tendency to whine, he is a highly valued member of the team, as he has also done an incredible piece of work on the digital part of the project. He is responsible for the awesome layout of the wiki and he has almost singlehandedly kept the blog updated over the summer. During the conference in Paris in the spring, he live-blogged incessantly, and his efforts were rewarded with a call from the Danish radio program Harddisken.
In the long hours spent waiting for PCR reactions and gels, he has enjoyed racing against Sheila and Christian in MarioKart on an old-school Nintendo 64. These races revealed him as a very sore loser. If you beat him in a game (any game), you've certainly cheated!
Louise
Louise is 23 years old and studies biomedicine on her fourth year. She was one of the founders of this year's iGEM team, and it was only due to the efforts of her, Christian and Lars Christian that the existing team was broght together in the first place.
Louise is a very happy person with a great sense of humour. She can always keep up a positive atmosphere even in the darkest of times, and she smiles perpetually whether appropriate or not.
Over the summer, she has learnt many things, including how to write and, to some extent, understand HTML code. That in itself is quite an accomplishment. In the few hours left where she isn't working on iGEM (or sleeping), she likes to spend with her family and friends or just lying on her sofa watching TV.
Nobody knows what the academic future holds for Louise as she isn't really one to plan that far ahead. One could imagine her writing a Ph.d., possibly concerning cancer development, but we all look forward to being surprised!
Maria
If you are roaming the halls of SDU after midnight and you find yourself being spoken to in the imperative by a small woman, ordering you to fetch her more pipette tips, you've probably met Maria.
She is a 5th year biochemistry and molecular biology student. She is currently 24 years old but plans to change that some time in March next year. She shares a house with Sheila and their cat Clive. None of them are lovers (as far as we know). Maria has been heavily involved in the lab work, and although her main focus has been on developing the photosensor, she has been busy answering questions from all corners of the lab, earning her the title of Lab Mom. Additionally, she has accumulated a significant number of nicknames, such as Queen of Unfunny Land, Shorty, Hamster, the Little One and Eagle Eyes. Don't even ask.
When she's not being benignly bullied by her teammates, she enjoys walking, baking cakes and folding her clothes with disturbing precision. In the future you will probably find her bossing people around in her own lab, while simultaneously answering never ending phone calls from confused lab rats.
Marie
Marie is 20 years old and has just begun her third year of studies of biochemistry and molecular biology. Her work in the iGEM project has primarily been focused on creating the retinal generator along with Tommy and Christian, which has probably been quite a handful.
In the rare hours when she's not working on iGEM, she earns a little extra money in IKEA by helping people find the bookcase that’s exactly right for them, or she spends time with the people closest to her. When she's alone, she knows of nothing better than to sit in a comfortable chair with a good book, jazz on the radio and a glass of white wine.
Apart from intending to become a famous scientist and the first single person to win a Nobel prize thrice, she also aspires to becoming an author, probably of slightly supernatural novels for grown kids and young adults.
She is the youngest member of the team and the only one not allowed to drink alcohol while in Boston, which is cause for mild irritation for her and great fun for the rest of us.
Pernille
Pernille is 24 years old and studies biomedicine on her fourth year. In iGEM, her work has been focused on hyperflagellating the bacteria.
Pernille loves going to concerts and being swept up by the hordes of people around her, all being entranced by the same music.
She is very opinionated and isn't afraid of demanding to be heard. When refusing to participate in Adult movie Thursday, she acquired the title of the team's prude.  Pernille is perpetually envied her delicios lunch packs, often involving avocado, while the rest of us struggle with our dry bread and leftovers.
She is currently working on her bachelor project where she studies gene mutations in breast cancer.
Sheila
Sheila is 24 years old and she studies biochemistry and molecular biology. She has just begun her fifth year of study. She lives in a house with Maria and Clive (still not lovers). She has primarily focused her iGEM related work on hyperflagellating the bacteria.
Sheila has a great knowledge of films and series and she is the main provider of visual material for Adult movie Thursday. If you say a quote, however small and nondescript, she will know instantly what film you are referring to.
Sheila's baking skills have been greatly exercised over the summmer due to her tendency to get out of bed five minutes too late. At least.
She enjoys jumping around in the lab to the sound of ""I don't feel like dancing"" which is slightly contradictory.
She wants a Ph.d. degree in the field of biochemistry and molecular biology, not in the least so that she can call herself ""Doctor"" in the USA.
Sif
Sif studies philosophy, but in reality, she is a natural scientist in disguise.
When forced to make a decision about her education, she was fascinated by so many things, she couldn't decide. In the end, she chose to start at the base of all science and study philosophy. Nonetheless, she attended the lab crash course intending to be a part of the daily lab work.
When she isn't working on iGEM, she practices aikido, a Japanese martial art, and is generally interested in Japanese philosophy and culture. She is very educated and masters eight languages at the age of 25, largely due to several years spent abroad. She has lived in South America for half a year and in Japan for a year, and these stays have made up the foundation of her mastery of Spanish and Japanese.
She has a great passion for mushrooms which she collects, dries and displays in glass jars. She is also a vegetarian.
Søren
Søren is also one of our philosophy students, currently on his fourth year, and, as opposed to Sif, he is a true humanist. Although he is only 22, he is easily pictured sitting in a large, cushioned chair by the fire, smoking a pipe of fine tobacco and pondering the mysteries of life.
He has been a inexpendable asset in the development of our human practice project. He has made a great effort to understand all the details of microbiology before we started the serious part of our project and has been invaluable as a mediator in our discussions, particularly in the discussion about watermarking.
When he's away from his cushioned chair, he enjoys listening to heavy metal and playing Munchkin.
Tommy
Tommy is a hardcore chemist, and during his four years of study, all the chemicals have taken their effect. He is the funny guy on the team, entertaining us all with homemade words such as his favourite swear: “Craparoo”. There can be no doubt about when Tommy has finished an experiment. He loudly exclaims “Done!” in a way that only he can reproduce.
In the lab, Tommy has been a great help calculating concentrations.
Tommy dreams of becoming a famous black rapper called Dr. T (another thing only he can say properly), but he’ll probably end up actually using his education and become the leader of a high tech lab.
When he’s not spending his time on iGEM, he enjoys drinking, gossiping and spending time with his lovely girlfriend.
By the way, he’s 24.
Clive
Clive, also known as pSB1C3, is our team mascot. He was only a tiny kitten when he joined the iGEM team but has grown into a rebellious teenager in the meantime!
While his mothers, Maria and Sheila, spent all the long hours in the lab, Clive lived in our students' association room, enriching all who entered with much joy and numerous scratches.
A portrait of the people behind Flow-E. Aren't we pretty?

Motivation (English)
Synthetic biology is a new approach towards biological research and presents a new active field, giving room for creative and innovative ideas. We - 11 students from Bielefeld, Germany - want to accept that challenge.  The iGEM competition is a great opportunity in order to do so. Added to our everyday studies, developing an own project from scratch seems to be the best preparation for professional tasks. In our own responsibility we have to deal with the ups and downs of the biological praxis. Additionally we gain the opportunity to inspect tasks like the acquisition of sponsors and mastering public relations. Beyond that, we want to use iGEM to meet like-minded people from all over the world.
We intend to bring in an idea that is both, innovative and relevant in the everyday-live. Furthermore, it has to be realizable in the short period of time that is given, since all members of our team are engaged in their studies. A sensor for spiciness seems to meet these requirements. Every day millions of people try hot and spicy food, thereby making the market for hot sauces boom. By now, the spiciness of food is scaled in Scoville and measured by taste: How many drops of water neutralize the spiciness of one drop of sauce? Obviously, that is quite subjective. This is why we want to implement a biosensor to determine an objective value for the spiciness of food.
Motivation (German)
Synthetische Biologie bietet neue, ungenutzte Wege in der biologischen Wissenschaft und eignet sich somit als aktives Feld für kreative und innovative Ideen. Wir, 11 Studenten aus Bielefeld, wollen uns diesen neuen Möglichkeiten stellen. Der iGEM Wettbewerb bietet dafür die beste Grundlage. Ausserhalb des Uni-Alltags ein eigenstaendiges Projekt zu verwicklen, erscheint uns als eine der besten Vorbereitungen auf die beruflichen Aufgaben. Es gilt Eigenverantwortung zu erlernen und in der biologischen Praxis Rueckschlaege kreativ und eigenständig zu kompensieren. Das Projekt bietet zu dem die Möglichkeit neue Arbeiten wie Sponsoring und public relations mit dem Knüpfen neuer internationaler sozialer Kontakte zu verbinden.
Wir wollten eine Idee in den Wettbewerb einbringen, die sowohl innovativ, als auch alltagsrelevant ist. Zudem muss die Umsetzung in der wenigen zur Verfügung stehenden Zeit gelingen, da alle Studenten stark im universitären Alltag eingebunden sind. Ein Schärfesensor wird in der heutigen Gesellschaft immer mehr gebraucht. Millionen von Menschen versuchen sich täglich an immer schärferem Essen. Sie werden bei diesen Speisen mit ungeahnter Schärfe konfrontiert. Zudem boomt der Markt für unnatürlich scharfe Saucen. Der zunehmende Schärfegrad macht auch nicht vor der heimischen Currywurst halt. Zum jetzigen Zeitpunkt wird die Schärfe einer Speise mit der subjektiven Scoville-Skala evaluiert. Dabei wird abgeschmeckt wie viele Tropfen Wasser benötigt werden, um einen Tropfen der Speise zu neutralisieren. Um der Gesellschaft ein geeignetes Mittel Evaluierung der Schärfe zu geben, versuchen wir einen  Schärfesensor zu implementieren, welcher sensitiver und objektiver über die Schärfe einer Speise Auskunft gibt.
Motivation (French)
La biologie synthétique propose des sentiers nouveaux et inutilisés dans la science biologique. Par conséquent,  elle ouvre de nouvelles voies à des idées créatives et innovantes. La compétition d’iGEM offre la meilleure base pour ce projet. Pour nous, la meilleure préparation à un avenir professionnel, consiste à réaliser un projet autonome hors du quotidien universitaire. Nos objectifs sont d’apprendre la responsabilité  individuelle et de compenser de manière créative et autonome de possibles difficultés apparaissant lors de certaines expériences biologiques. Au delà de ce projet, il nous est aussi permis entre autres d’établir des connections entre différents domaines comme le sponsoring et les relations publiques, et aussi de nouveaux contacts internationaux.
Dans la concurrence, nous avons voulu impliquer une idée, qui se veut innovante et importante pour le quotidien. En outre, la réalisation du projet doit se faire dans le temps imparti aux étudiants. Ces derniers sont activement impliqués dans la vie quotidienne de l’université. De nos jours, la société a de plus en plus besoin d’un capteur de saveur relevée. De nos jours les repas épicés sont de plus en plus recherchés par la population ce qui crée une augmentation du marché des sauces épicées . Beaucoup de spécialités locales ont un goût plus épicé qu’auparavant, comme par exemple « la saucisse au curry » en Allemagne.  Présentement, l’échelle subjective « Scoville » est utilisée pour évaluer l’acuité du repas. La procédure consiste à tenter d’évaluer le nombre de gouttes d’eau nécessaires à la neutralisation d’une goutte du repas. Pour aider la société à explorer l’acuité du goût, nous essayons d’implémenter un capteur pour les saveurs relevées.  Ce moyen peut objectivement et sensiblement renseigner les gens sur les repas assimilés au quotidien.
Motivación (Spanish)
La biología sintética es un nuevo enfoque a la investigación biológica y presenta un nuevo campo activo, dando lugar a ideas creativas e innovadoras. Nosotros - 11 estudiantes de Bielefeld, Alemania - queremos enfrentarnos a ese desafío. La competencia de iGEM cuenta con una importante base para ello. Además de nuestros habituales estudios, el desarrollo de un proyecto propio partiendo desde cero parece ser la mejor formación para la actividad profesional. Dentro de nuestra propia responsabilidad, tenemos que enfrentarnos a los altibajos de la praxis biológica. Además tenemos la oportunidad de involucrarnos en tareas como la captación de patrocinadores y el dominio de las relaciones públicas. Por encima de ello, queremos usar iGEM para conocer gente con ideas afines de todo el mundo.
Intentamos introducir una idea, que es a la vez, innovadora y relevante par la vida cotidiana. Además, tiene que ser viable en el corto período de tiempo concedido, pues todos los miembros de nuestro equipo están comprometidos con sus estudios. Un sensor de picante parece cumplir con estos requisitos. Millones de personas pueban comida picante todos los días, haciendo que el mercado de salsas picantes triunfe. Por el momento, el picante de los alimentos se clasifica con la escala Scoville y se mide por el sabor: ¿cuántas gotas de agua neutralizan el sabor picante de una gota de salsa? Obviamente, esto es muy subjetivo. Por eso queremos introducir un biosensor para determinar un valor objetivo del picante de los alimentos.
La motivazione (Italiano)
La biologia sintetica è un innovativo approccio alla ricerca e presenta un nuovo campo d’attività che apre nuovi spazi per idee creative e innovative. Noi, 10 studenti di Bielefeld (Germania), vogliamo confrontarci con questo campo e la iGEM competition è un’ottima opportunità per farlo. In più valutiamo l’opportunità di poter acquisire sponsor e di approfondire pubbliche relazioni. Ma prima di tutto, vogliamo sfruttare questa occasione per confrontarci con persone da altre parti del mondo con i nostri stessi obiettivi.
Siamo intenzionati a portare avanti un’idea che sia allo stesso tempo innovativa e di chiara applicazione pratica. Tuttavia deve essere qualcosa di realizzabile nel breve periodo di tempo concessoci, in quanto tutti i membri del nostro gruppo sono impegnati con i loro studi. L’idea di un sensore per la piccantezza sembra soddisfare tutti questi requisiti. Ogni giorni milioni di persone mangiano cibi piccanti e speziati, incrementando il mercato delle salse piccanti. Al momento la piccantezza dei cibi è misurata nella scala di Scoville ed è valutata dal gusto: quante gocce di acqua servono per neutralizzare una goccia di salsa piccante? Ovviamente tutto ciò è alquanto soggettivo ed è questa la motivazione per cui vogliamo progettare un biosensore in grado di determinare in maniera oggettiva la piccantezza di un cibo.
Мотивация (Russian)
Синтетическая биология это новый подход к биологическим исследованиям и представляет новые активные области, предоставляет возможности для творческих и новаторских идей. Мы - 11 студентов из Билефельда в Германии – хочим справиться с этой задачей. И при этом большое основание группы iGEM это конкурентоспособность. Кроме нашей повседневной учёбы мы разрабатываем собственный проект с нуля и считаем это как наиболее эффективной подготовкой для профессиональных задач. Кроме того мы получаем возможность для решения задач, таких как приобретение спонсоров и освоение общественных отношений. Также мы хотим использовать нашу группу iGEM для встречи с единомышленниками со всего мира. Мы намерены преподнести идею, котоая является инновационной и одновременно  значительной  в повседневной жизни. Кроме того она должна быть реализуемой в течение короткого периода времени который нам дан, поскольку все члены нашей команды находятся на обучении.  Все эти требования удовлетворяют развитие так называемого показателя остроты. Миллионы людей употребляют острую и жгучую пищу каждый день, что силно поднимает экономический рынок острых соусов. К настоящему времени острота продовольствия масштабируется вкусом и измеряется по шкале Сковилла: сколько капель воды нейтрализируют остроту одной капли соуса? Очевидно, что это является довольно субъективным. Вот почему мы хотим реализовать биосенсор для детерминированной объективной ценности остроты пищи.
我们的动力 (Chinese)
合成生物学是一个新兴的生物学研究领域，这为研究者提供了广阔的创意空间。我们比勒菲尔德大学  的11名学生想要通过iGEM这个平台来应对这份挑战。除了日常学习，从零开始开发一个自己的项目似乎  是为我们将来的专业工作做出的最好准备。我们必须面对生物实验中种种顺利与不顺，并且争取得到赞助  商的资助和协调各种公共社会关系。最重要的是，我们想通过iGEM这个平台结识世界各地志同道合的  人。因为团队成员的日常学习非常紧张忙碌，所以我们希望我们的项目既有创新性，又能和实际生活相关  联，并且能在所给定的短时间内完成。最后我们确定了辣味传感器这个想法。每天都有许多人在尝试辛辣  食物，但是目前对食物辣度的检测仅仅源于依靠感官测试的史高维尔指标，但是这个方法受个人的主观影  响很大。这就是为什么我们希望研究一个生物传感器，用于客观地评测食物的辣度。

Abgsehne vu unsrer alldägliche Laborarbet bereidet uns d’Entwicklung vu so enem Projekt vu grunduff ufd bevorstehende berufliche Ufgabe vor. Well ma für alles selbschtverandwordlich sin, müsse ma dann halt äu mitm Uff un Ab im Labor läbe. Dazöe noch bekumme ma äu d’Chance ebbis dazuzlere uf Gebiede wie zum Beispiel d’ Awerbung vu Sponsore un Öffentlichkeitsarbet.  Ganz obe uf da lischt schdoht nadierlig, dass ma uns mit andere Litt vu überall her üs da Welt bekannt mache kenne.

Well e begrenzdi Zitt vorgäh isch, mäesse ma des alles in ebbe dem kleine Zittfenschder realisiere, äu wenn alli vu uns näbeher noch ihr „normales“ Studium verfolge mäen. E Sensor um d’Schärfe zmesse schient dene Anforderunge grecht zwere. Millione vu Litt probiere pro Dag vu scharfem Esse. Bis jetz isch d’Schärfe über d’Scoville-Skala agäh wore, wo sich nachm subjektiv gmessene Gschmack grichded het: Wievieli Wasserdropfe neudralisiere d’Schärfe vu einem Dropfe Soß? Wie gseit, des isch halt üsserordendlich subjektiv. Deswege wemma gern e Biosensor iführe, um e objektiver Wert für da Schärfegrad vum Esse zha.
Motivasion (Berlinerisch)
Synthetische Biology is enee neue Heranjehensweise an biolojische Wissenschaf und presentiert neue Forschungsfelder, die Raum füa kreative und innovative Ideen bürgt. Wir, dit sind elfe an Studenten aus Bielefeld, (Nordrheinfestfalen) wollen diese Herausforderung auf uns nehmen.  Dit eijäm is ne jute Grundlaje dafür. Neben unseres rejulären Studiums, bildet die Entwicklung eneet eijenen Projekt beste Voraussetzung für professionelle Anwendung. In unsere Veräntwortung liegt der Umjang mit Erfoljen und Niederschläjen der biolojischen Praxis. Suzätzlich kriejn wa einsicht in die Anwerbung von Sponsorn und dem Umjang mit Öffentlichkeitsarbeit. Der Wettbewerb bietet aussadem die Möglichkeit Gleichjesinnte aus der janzen Welt su treffen.
Unsere Absicht ist es, zum Ennen erfindungsreiche und alltagsjegräuchliche Ideen einsubringen. Zum Anderen muss dieset Projekt innerhalb der seitlichen Vorjabe su realisieren sein. Eneen Schärfe-Sensor su afinden, wöde disen Anforderungen jerecht werden. In der modernen Küsche isset anjesagt immer schärfa su kochen, wodurch Chilli Soßn stak im Komm sind. Jejenwärtig würd die Schärfe in Scoville jemessen, einer auf subjektivn Empfundn basierende Einheit. Dabei ist die Ansahl an Wassertropfn, welsche zur Neutralisation der Schärfe benötigt wird maßjebend. Dit is der Grund für unser Team nen Biosensor zu entwickeln, der auf objektiva Grunlaje Schärfe messen kann.
Unsor Elan (Sächsisch)
Syndedische Biologie is n neuer Ansatz dor biologschn Forschung und bieded`n neues Feld mid vieln Möglichkeidn für neue und gretive Ideen. Mit zähn Studendn wolln uns dor Aufgabe stelln. Und dor iGEM Weddbewerb is dafür wie geschaffn. Fürs spädere Berufslebn isses ne gudde idee och mal nen eigenes Projekd zu endwiggeln. In eischenverandwordung ham mir mit den höhn und diefen dor biologschen Parxis zum kämpfn. Och könn mir Einbligge in andore Ofgabn wie Sonsoring und public relations gewinnn. Noch dazu könn mir andore Leude aus dor ganzen Welt dreffen, die och so denken wie mir.
Mir wolln ne Idee verbreidn , die sowohl neu als och relevand is. Abor s mus och in der kuzn Zeid zu schaffen sein, die mir bloß zur Verfügung ham. N Sensor fürs Scharfe scheind da genau s rischtsche zu sein. Millionen von Leudn fuddern jeden Dach scharfes Essen und bring den Mardt zum wachsn. Bisher wird die Schärfe in Scoville gemssen. Wieviele Wassordroppn sind notwendsch um ehn Droppn Soße zu neutralisieren? Nu klor, das is ganz schön subjecgdiv. Und  damids bald objegdiv wern kann, machn mir den Biosensor.

Bielefeld University (English)
Founded in the late 60`s Bielefeld University is one of the youngest members in the system of higher education in Germany. It is the largest of the six universities in Bielefeld with its 17.500 students. The university is divided into 13 different faculties ( see table below ). Well known for its outstanding disciplinary social science faculty, the university also turned into a lighthouse of biotechnology during the last few years.
Since the founding of the so called CeBiTec (Center for Biotechnology) in 1998 by the senate of Bielefeld the university established a huge range of techniques and equipment to cover all „omics“ research fields. Since the summer of 2007 the CeBiTec resides in a new building on the campus of Bielefeld University. The building offers laboratories for the Institute for Genome Research and Systems Biology, in particular for the Technology Platform Genomics. With focus on international collaborations , the platform hosts several techniques including sequencing (454 as well as illumina), transcriptomics, and annotations over proteomics (GC-GC-MS, MALDI-TOF-MS, qTOF-MS) up to the metabolomics took place here in the CeBiTec. Furthermore, the Chair of Genome Research resides in the building. Also the Institute for Biophysics and Nanosciences and the Institute for Biochemistry and Bioengineering run specific laboratories. This way, the CeBiTec creates an unique environment of excellent competence.

Bielefeld - A city thinking outside the box (English)
The Jahn square in Bielefeld
Bielefeld is the capital city of Ostwestfalen Lippe, one of the most dynamic economic regions in Germany, and enchants by its young and dynamic spirit. Bielefeld presents the cultural center in this region and develops into a melting pot where six excellent universities, a renowned cultural scene, pioneering social institutions and international companies are accumulated. 30.000 out of 330.000 inhabitants are students, who are creating a booming and lively city,  brimming with creativity. In 2011 the ""Campus Bielefeld"" will be developed. It is embedded in the city and the Teutoburger forest and will be one of the state-of-the-art university campuses. Therefore it will foster interdisciplinary research as well as it might present a basis for startup-companies. It will be a state-of-the-art university campus, providing an environment to deliver excellent education. Moreover there will be enough space for public parks which guarantees a nice and creative work environment.
The town's landmark is the medieval Sparrenburg at the ridge of the  Teutoburger forest. It is situated only a few walking minutes away from the  lively historical and the modern city center. The cozy old town  with its cafés and bars is a perfect location for having a good time.  Bielefeld's West Quarter hosts a number of atmospheric pubs and bars where you will find a lot of students socializing.
The culture scene of Bielefeld is affected by young actors and new  ideas. Attractions include well established art galleries, two excellent municipal  theatres, outstanding concert halls and a multiplicity of independent  galleries, theatres and studios, which are located into old industrial  places all over the town. Furthermore Bielefeld offers a varied nightlife everyone can enjoy, from fancy clubs and cafés to a variety of festivals. If you like to go shopping, you best hit the big department stores at  the ""Bahnhofstrasse"", the charming boutiques at the west quarter of  Bielefeld or the abundance of local markets. A visit to the  spectacular ""StadtParkLandschaft"" is a must, with opportunity for sports or just relaxing in the countryside.

Jonas Aretz
Currently in his 2nd semester of the master's degree 'molecular biotechnology'
The outstanding event in my last years of researching and studying was my bachelor thesis about repeated-batch fermentations with Bacillus strains. Beside I worked as a tutor for lab courses in which the students had to ferment Escherichia coli including some downstream processes. For my studies in molecular biotechnology I had some lab courses in cell culture technology (antibody production with and simulation of cell cultures including a lot of analytics and purification of the produced antibody) and fermentation technology (production of penicillin and GFP), too.
When I'm not in the lab (which is quite seldom during iGEM ;) ) I play soccer, the piano, sometimes badminton or I go to the gym. In addition I do stuff specific to students like hang out with friends, go to parties, drink coffe, eat, sleep or just ""waste time"" in a different way. In general I'm quite spontaneous and always swift to do things that promise to be fun.
""The age will rise, in which we will understand how a genome effectively works and we are able to use organisms like we want to without imitating in nature available parts. Synthetic Biology is a first step into this direction and I am glad to participate in this revolutionary development (almost) from its beginning.""
Frieder Hänisch
Currently in his 4th semester of the master's degree 'genome-based systems biology'
Starting with a bachelor in ""Molecular Biotechnology"" I made my bachelor degree in the field of renewable energy. Working with a strain of the hydrogen producing ""Chlamydomonas reinhardtii"" I studied the physiology of some promising new opportunities for our world's energy problem. To get more insights in the omics-techniques I switched for my master to ""Genome Based Systems Biology"" and in my master thesis I `m  working with an acarbose (diabetes agent) producing Actinoplanes. In a collaboration with ""Bayer Healthcare"" we are going to reveal the changes in the transcriptome under acarbose producing conditions.
At this time I'm looking for a project for my PhD with challenges in the field of systems or synthetic biology, preferentially with a medical background.
As a retired passionated baskeball player I now turned to mountainbiking. After working time I love to ride my bike with friends trough the local woods and in the wintertime I carry out my Snowboard from the basement and went south for a trip to the Alps. This summer I went to the Alps again and tried some fixed rope route climbing - it was a great pleasure!
""Synthetic biology is the key technique for an increased biosecurity through the design of minimal genomes. Because genetically manipulated organisms can only survive in their specific environment.""
Nikolas Kessler
Currently in his 4th semester of the master's degree 'genome-based systems biology'
In 2005 I began my bachelor in molecular biotechnology and in 2008 I switched to the master studies of genome based systems biology. From the very beginning I had a strong drift to computer science. In my bachelor thesis I did both, wetlab and programming for an online-image based cell classifier. Later I specialised more in biodatamining and at the moment I am preparing a realtime collaboration software in my master thesis. My upcoming PhD project will deal with analysis and dataming in metabolomics and it will somehow combine all preceding topics.
In my leisure time (as far as iGEM allows) I love sailing, soccer, playing the piano or my guitar. Besides that I am a lot into design and computer arts. And for relaxing nothing compares to beating some time with my friends in any random way.
""Biology is keeping an invaluable treasure of functions and systems. Recombination and adaption of these will help to better understand life, and it will open new medical and technological doors.""
Nils-Christian Lübke
Currently in his 4th semester of the master's degree 'genome-based systems biology'.
I started studying at the University of Bielefeld in 2005 on the subject molecular biotechnology. During my BA-thesis I optimized batch and fed-batch E.coli fermentation with the focus on the steadiness of plasmids.
In my master course I switch to ""Genome Based Systems Biology"" to amplify my knowledge about molecular biology. Currently I am working on my master thesis, which deals with the metabolomic profiling of heart failure patients. I try to identify possible metabolites as candidates for a biomarker. This could be used in clinical routines to discriminate between the stage of ""ill"" and ""healthy"" in order to improve medical attendance.
I spend my humble free time with movies, music and relaxing with friends. As a former world class football player (i avoid to use the term ""soccer""), I am still connected to the fascination of this sport.
""I define synthetic biology as a positive modification of already existing environmental systems in order to create a broad range of new possibilities for medical, environmental and industrial concerns.""
Jonas Marschall
Currently in his 4th semester of the master's degree 'molecular biotechnology'
The university has become my second home since I started to study molecular biotechnology in 2005. Within my studies in Bielefeld and abroad, I focused on glycobiology, soon. Future plans are to start a PhD in glycobiological research. Beside studying, and this time is limited but accepted, I do endurance sports by riding the mountain bike or running. Reconstructing classical racing-bikes and cooking natural gourmet-menus are my facorite activities inside. The latter can be connected to our capsaicine sensing-system by predicting spiciness in my self-made meals.
By synthetic biology numerous human requirements can be realized in future.
""Pressurizing one's body brings life's beauty to one's mind.""
Armin Neshat
Currently in his 4th semester of the master's degree 'molecular biotechnology'
My curiosity and enthusiasm towards life sciences has been the driving force to start the undergraduate course molecular biotechnology at Bielefeld University in October 2005. After the receipt of the Bachelor's degree I studied molecular biotechnology as part of an ERASMUS program at the Royal Institute of Technology in the beautiful city of Stockholm, the true Venice of the North. Following this I continued my studies at Bielefeld University and will receive my M. Sc. this November. Afterwards I will start a PhD within the CLIB-Graduate Cluster Industrial Biotechnology.
In my far too short free time, I prefer to relax with my friends, watch movies, go clubbing and various different things as long as they don’t remind me of the work waiting for me in the lab. I also love to geek and to look out for new neat gadgets.
""Economically interesting possibilities of synthetic biology are among others the production of new products and the acceleration of product development. Currently products of great economic and social importance are already beeing developed, such as the malaria drug Artemisinin.""
Kirsten Tschapalda
Currently in her 4th semester of the master's degree 'molecular biotechnology'
During my studies I tried to grab a bite of expertise in every branch of biotechnology. Therefore I worked with bacteria, fungi, algae, and mammalian tissue. I produced various proteins or DNA and analyzed it in various ways. And during all this I finally found my passion: Purification. I don't care whether it's DNA or protein. I am pretty much into developing strategies in order to get a product as pure as possible and finally doing all tests necessary to verify that it is. This mania of cleanliness completely falls of me as soon as I leave the lab. I spend most of my leisure time outdoors: Horse riding, dog training, hiking and travelling are my biggest favors.
""I reckon that synthetic biology hides a bunch of unexpected prospects and currently we are only scratching the surface of a very complex and fast developing topic. Who knows what chances will show up in future? It is definitely a very exciting part of research.""
Simon Unthan
Currently in his 2nd semester of the master's degree 'molecular biotechnology'
In the fall of 2009 I obtained the degree Bachelor of Science in the field of Molecular Biotechnology at Bielefeld University. During my arrangement of academic courses I focused particularly in the area of pharmaceutical biotechnology, with emphasis on animal cell cultivation and the purification of biopharmaceuticals. To enrich my theoretical knowledge with practical experience I successfully applied for a bachelor thesis at Boehringer Ingelheim at the division of Purification Development. Moreover, I performed a project work abroad in the laboratory of the Animal Cell Technology Group located at KTH in Stockholm during my term as an exchange student in 2009.
In my spare time I support the German association for students of Biotechnology “btS” at its local group in Bielefeld. After the daily work at the university I like to go to the gym and play football or handball. Recently I am also taking much pleasure in the invention of new board games, although my first developments still need some improvements.
""The adaption and optimization of natural pathways in organisms by means of synthetic biology offers possible solutions to challenges of mankind. To name one, it might afford the establishment of a sustainable and ecological energy supply.""
Frederik Walter
Currently in his 4th semester of the master's degree 'genome-based systems biology'
In 2005 I started my bachelor studies in molecular biotechnology at Bielefeld University. During my studies, I gained more and more interest in structural and functional genome research. Concerning my bachelor thesis it was important to me to work at the interface of genome research and biotechnology. During this time I discovered my passion for genetic and metabolic engineering. By joining the masters programme 'genome based systems biology' I was able to get an overview about the functionality of regulatory networks and metabolic competence in general.  At the beginning of this year I completed a student's project at the Institue of Molecular Systems Biology at ETH Zurich. Currently, I am looking forward to finish my master thesis by the end of November.
""As the groundbraking technology of the 21st century, synthetic biology will make a major contribution to the preservation and improvement of our standard of living in a growing and aging society.“
Timo Wolf
Currently in his 2nd semester of the master's degree 'molecular biotechnology'
After finishing my civil service in 2006 I began studying Molecular Biotechnology at Bielefeld University. In 2009 I completed my bachelor thesis with the focus on optimizing a fed batch fermentation to obtain Streptavidin. Afterwards I continued my studies with the aim to get more advanced knowledge in fermentation technologies, downstream processing, analytics and of curse genetics as well as synthetic biology during our iGEM project. My motivation for iGEM is the independent work in a team with the aim to solve scientific questions and the exchange with other international teams. During my leisure time I like to play soccer, as well as watching it or just hang around with friends.
""Synthetic Biology is an interesting and relatively new field of science, where young scientists have plenty of opportunities to pursue innovative ideas. With interdisciplinary approaches there is huge potential to develop new technologies and solve future problems.""
Eva Brombacher
After dealing with hearts in the course of my Master's thesis I now changed to brains. More details
""Concerning the medical sector I am hoping for personalized medication and therapies through synthetic biology. Besides that, the potential of the latter could also serve the environment by designing bacteria eliminating polluting substances.""

Les Genomiques
Malgré nos origines divers, on vit tous à Cuernavaca et on assiste la même Université: l'Université Nationale Autonome de Mexico, campus Morelos. Pour la plupart d'entre nous, on s'est fait la connaissance ici lorsqu'on a été acceptés au Programme des Sciences Genomiques. Ce pour cela que nous sommes très proches les uns des autres.
On voit dans la photo an dessus l'Entrée Principale aux Salles des Cours. Le hamac à gauche est suffisamment frais les jours chauds ;)

New method
Welcome to Tokyo-NoKoGen wiki!
We are Tokyo-NoKoGen and come from Tokyo, Japan.
Our team members all belong to the Department of Biotechnology at Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology.  Our team, Tokyo-NoKoGen, is composed of 18 students, 6 instructors and one adviser.
Although we ended up with a bronze medal last year, it generated lots of excitement and interest within our team and within our school.
This year, Tokyo-NoKoGen has 13 new members. We are determined to get a gold medal and fight as a finalist for the grand prize.
In researching, our team became very interested in environmental contamination and energy problem.
So our team designed the new project; EcoTanker, and we try to achieve the goal of our project.
We feel the whole iGEM experience is VERY good for students and we believe synthetic biology has become an important field.
Therefore our team will certainly continue to generate great interest in synthetic biology and iGEM within our school.
We believe, in the immediate future, the technique of synthetic biology will be used for our life.
Therefore, we are involved in the development of synthetic biology through our iGEM project. Of course, we anticipate very much the meeting with exciting and interesting studies of other teams.
Let’s open up new possibility of synthetic biology!

Collaboration with the Freiburg_Bioware team
Since our university has two teams participating at iGEM this year
our collaboration partner was quickly found. The Bioware team asked us to help them make a sponsoring Website to collect funds for our two projects. Over the time we got to know the members of the Bioware team, because we were working in the same place: While the Bioware team worked in a lab we were sitting in the associated kitchen and common room working on our code.
We got to be friends and hang out together in the evenings. Free time activities were e.g. the canoeing tour on the river Rhine or the BBQ on the top of the biology building.
Since the Bioware team took care about the sponsoring and organized the journey to iGME for both of our teams, they spared our small team a lot of work and we could concentrate better on our work.
When the complexity of the project became bigger, we needed help from potential users. The Bioware team answered all our questions and gave us proposals to improve the program outputs.
The primer designer program
In the summer the Bioware theam asked us to create a program for primer design. Until then they were using a spread-sheet calculation program to find primers for their PCRs, although the process can be automated. The primerdesign program made this task much easier for them. Furthermore a primer designer robot seemed like the perfect candidate for our growing set of add-on robots and so both our teams profited from this collaboration. Read their part of the story on their wiki !

Complete name: Natasha Natalia Gómez Pérez
Age: 19 years
Career: Biology degree.
Specialization area: Zoology
Institution: University of Panama.
e-mail: nanagope@gmail.com
Hobbies: read books, papers, write about general things that happened in life and that pass through my mind, play guitar, sing, play tennis, spend time with my family and messing around with friends and finally,  one of the most important things for me, be absorbed in my own thoughts.
iGEM expectations: This is a great step for doing something for the humanity. The entire world could change for good thanks to the synthetic biology. The power is in our hands, let`s do better things for the future.
Research interests: I am extremely interested in conducting research in order to contribute to the knowledge and development of humanity in the scientific field. Since I was a child, my passion has been to study animal behavior.  However, since I joined to study biology, the ecology and the environmental biology has been very important to me primarily because we are living a crucial moment for the world as global warming. Now I see more clearly that the synthetic biology is a good new increasing field to combat this and one good example is what we are doing in our proyect of rhamnolipids. I have many questions, there are now many aspects of biology that I like to investigate. I am looking for many answers. To go deeper and deeper into the wonderful world of the study of life, I reaffirm the maxim of Socrates, ""I only know that I know nothing"", and that gives me more thirsty of wanting to know.
Name: Nicole M. Tayler S.
Age: 25
Degree: Biotechnology
Institution: INDICASAT
Hobbies: I really don't think of myself as a person that has or cultivates ""hobbies"" at this point in my life since all of my time is shared between my thesis project (almost done! Yeay for me!) and the iGEM venture. This keeps me in the lab A LOT but I enjoy it very much. A few of the things that I do to blow off steam is sing (not only in the shower) because it helps me concentrate and make an otherwise bad day into a less stressful one. I absolutely enjoy the times when my best friend and I go out to have nice meals, as my grandmother used to say ""Eating is the only thing that we bring with us when we go back to mother earth."" A little hippie, I know. Finally, hanging out with my friends from the lab is one the things that I very much enjoy. When we are all together, we have a really hard time keeping a straight face. That's good.
The iGEM Experience: When I first learned about this, I had no idea what it was all about. Once it was all clear, let's get to work. All of the work done at the lab have all been worth it in order to come up with something that would help the world in some way, something that would further solidify Panama's position on the world map of research; a position that has been and continues to be nurtured by the best.  I hope that everyone enjoys learning about our rhamnolipid project as much as we have enjoyed concieving and producing it.
Research Interests: Sometimes I feel that I should know by now what is it that I want to invest the rest of my life doing, but being in biotechnology has taught me so much in so many areas that sometimes it's hard for me to make up my mind! I've always wanted to know what makes things tick (bacterias, viruses, parasites, etc.), with a little bit of that knowledge, I can try to find better ways for them to tick or, stop them from ticking (only if it's a bad tick). For my immediate future, I'm very interested in pursuing a doctorate degree in Pharmaceutical biotechnology.

Hobbies: Think, learn about life, fungus growing ants biology, read about phylosophy, history, science and sci-fi, listen music (playing guitar, drums, sing, specially rock music), write, I like to hear and talk with my parents and old people, I love to work in the lab and outdoor lab, sleep is the greatest pleasure, persue of happiness.
The iGEM Experience: One of the best scientific experience that I have had. I feel that I am part of something huge in terms of scientific development. I am learning a lot from the instructors, advisors and my colleagues in the lab respect to biotechnology. As a biology student am trying to understand life through evolution and how life works in his multiple forms. With the iGEM experience I am starting to see life with another perspective under the umbrella of synthetic biology, that is trying to figure it out how to  desing and modify biological systems into a standard way. Richard Feynman said ‘What I cannot create, I do not understand.’  this became one of the slogans of us, as biological engineering. Now I have a better way to understand life with the synergy between Biology  and engineered. The iGEM program made me a pioneer in this new scientific discipline in my country and I really want to keep working in this field.
Research Interests: Life understanding through evolution is my passion. I am an undergraduate student in Biology oriented in microbiology. I have been working those few years with the biology of the fungus growing ants as intern in the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute. Here in the department of behavior and evolution I start my travel into scientific research, studying how ants interact with microorganisms, how ants work against diseases, evolution of profilactic behaviors in the fungus growing ants, simbiosis, antagonism, co-evolution, bacterias, fungus, antibiotics, ecology are terms with that I have been familiarized. The development of engineered biology became one of my interest when I was studying microbial genetics, the manipulation of DNA brings to us a full knowledge of how life works and I am really interested to be involved of this kind of investigations.  Now with iGEM, the Synthetic Biology appears to me as one step further of biology engineering and I am doing a complete diving in biotechnology techniques with the aim to learn how to design and modify biological systems. I will keep studying and working in this field because it leads us to the full application of biology as a substance.

Degree: Environmental Biology
Institution: INDICASAT
Hobbies: I like very much to read and ride bicycles and clear my mind from time to time. I like to bake cakes that I feed to my friends and co-workers. That makes me and them very happy.
The iGEM Experience: At first I was worried that I couldn't make it into the team, but once I started I realized that there was a lot I didn't know about synthetic biology, much less to have it so close, I understood that there is so much that can be done in that field and it has been a great learning experience.
Research Interests: I'd llove to have the opportunity to work with marine ecosystems, specially with coral reefs or whales. I love to dive and snorkel, I believe that the ocean is greatly diverse and it is impressive. Earth also has a great diversity but, the depth of the ocean is something so marvelous with all of the creatures and it is a shame that we cannot study it so easily.

Hobbies: I spend most of my time at the lab, my co-workers are all very good friends so we have a very good time, but on my free time I love to go to the movies or watch a movie at home. For me, that is the most relaxing thing there is! I love to spend time with my boyfriend, to travel and know new places. Even though I'm not a great cook, I love food! Every outing is complemented with a good meal.
The iGEM experience: Everything has been learning. From learning how to organize ourselves, to the procedures that we have done in the lab. We have learned from each other, from our own mistakes and how to fix them. It has been an intense job, how to juggle our daily work, english courses, personal life and iGEM has been tough but not impossible. In the end, all of it has been worth it. I hope that everything that we have learned helps the next teams that participate in representation of Panama.
Research Interests: I'm a Biotecnologist therefore, my main interest is Molecular Biology. I'm currently working in the area of Parasitology and I hope to continue learning in that field and continue in Biomedical research.

Hobbies:  I am movie-lover, I like all types of movies with the exception of horror films. I like to read, to stay healthy by doing excercise. But what I like most of all is to travel.
The iGEM Expectations: It has been a new experience where I have learned a lot and we've worked very much; staying at the lab until late running the experiments. We would like to win very much so we can probe to the panamanian people that there are a lot of young people in Panama with the entreprenurial spirit.

Hobbies: The right word for me is passions, because my passions are Karate Do, running, math & physics, read (a lot) and philosophy. On the other hand I like to watch sports and scientific programs.
The iGEM Experience: As a scientist am really excite of be part of this, and could work in state of the art science field, now i want to continue understanding and learning of Synthetic Biology. But as philosopher I think that actual science have fallen in “do” without think, works in fields that not understand without the necessary “why” questions about (f.e. What we are really doing and why?). People accept new approach without question about the implications.
Research Interests: Science and Philosophy fundaments of reality and believes, how we can create a model to explain something?. Scientist’s human practice.

Hobbies: read books, papers, write about general things that happened in life and that pass through my mind, play guitar, sing, play tennis, spend time with my family and messing around with friends and finally,  one of the most important things for me, be absorbed in my own thoughts.
iGEM expectations: This is a great step for doing something for the humanity. The entire world could change for good thanks to the synthetic biology. The power is in our hands, let`s do better things for the future.
Research interests: I am extremely interested in conducting research in order to contribute to the knowledge and development of humanity in the scientific field. Since I was a child, my passion has been to study animal behavior.  However, since I joined to study biology, the ecology and the environmental biology has been very important to me primarily because we are living a crucial moment for the world as global warming.

Where are we from
We are from the Republic of Panama, Panama's natural history is of great importance to the American continent. 3.5 million years ago Panama emerged linking the seabed of North and South America. The migration of species allows the exchange of species from north to south, further increasing the number of plants, animals and other life forms in both continents. Because of evolutionary and geological processes, Panama has one of the richest biodiversities in the world. It is a huge laboratory ready to be responsibly used. Panama in native language means ""abundance of flowers, butterflies and fish.""

My education was in mechanical engineering (course 2) at MIT. I then lived in Tokyo for three years, getting a Masters degree in mechanical engineering from the Tokyo Institute of Technology. I spent my career in software development in quantitative finance and consumer web sites.
I have lived in Panama for a year. I read about the iGEM contest in February. When I learned that in addition to world famous universities some small schools participate, I thought ""I am going to try to organize a team from Panama!""
Sara Pinzon
I did my PhD at Imperial College London and the Natural History Museum, London in Molecular systematics and evolution of insects. I came back to Panama at the beginning of 2010 to apply all the techniques and methodologies I learned in the UK.
I was very pleased when Oris Sanjur and members of SENACYT (Panamanian Institute of Science, Technology and Innovation) invited me to be one of the instructors of the first Panamanian team to participate in iGEM. I trust this is a great opportunity for young panamanian students to develop and improve their skills and learn from colleagues from all around the world.

I obtained my doctoral degree in Molecular Biology and Biochemistry in Spain. After living in beautiful Andalucía I moved to Florida for my first postdoc position and then moved on to the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research in the Washington, DC area for a much longer second postdoctoral position. I moved back to my country two years ago and when SENACYT asked for my institution, INDICASAT, to help the team, I was asked if I could take charge of the team work in our lab. It has been great to see the independent thinking, great enthusiasm, and pride the students have shown facing the fact that they will be making it possible for our country, Panama, to be in the iGEM contest for the first time in our incipient scientific history.

Oris Sanjur
I obtained a doctoral degree in Cell and Developmental Biology from Rutgers University, New Jersey. After I got my degree, I returned to my home country Panama, for a two-year postdoct at the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute (STRI), using molecular tools to infer relationship among domesticated and wild squashes. In 2000, I accepted a position at STRI as Manager of the Laboratory of Molecular Biology and Evolution. Recently, I was appointed Associate Director for Science Administration at STRI. I got involved with iGEM when I was invited by SENACYT to participate as one of the instructors for the Panama team. It has been a wonderful experience to have the opportunity to collaborate and share ideas with a group of very bright and enthusiastic Panamanian students that have embrace the challenge of representing Panama in the iGEM contest.

iGEM 2010
Krystal Annand
BSc (Hons) Chemistry: University of Aberdeen
I have just graduated from Aberdeen University with an honours degree in Chemistry and am now looking for a chemistry related job.  I have enjoyed participating in the iGEM project and meeting a lot of great people and can not wait to see Boston and all the other projects!
Brychan Cromwell
MEng Chemical Engineering (4th Year): University of Aberdeen
I am currently in my fourth year of Chemical Engineering degree.  As well as being on the iGem team, I am in charge of the presentation for Aberdeen's Formula Student team (Tau Racing), working on my thesis on fuel injection systems in car engines, president of Aberdeen University Engineering Society and the ExxonMobil Student Ambassador for Aberdeen Uni.
I am also very much looking forward to going to Boston and can't wait for the Jamboree!
Lisa Dryburgh
BSc Hons Maths and Physics (4th Year): University of Aberdeen
I've just started my 4th and final year of my honours degree.  Also just started an honours project on Game Theory which is challenging but also interesting!  I loved being part of iGEM and spent most of my summer in front of a computer whilst listening to Margaret-Ann singing Disney! :D
Joseph Hoare
BSc Hons Immunology (4th Year): University of Aberdeen
Joseph is currently finishing his degree at Aberdeen.
Justyna Kucia
MSci Biotechnology (Applied Molecular Biology) with Industrial Placement: University of Aberdeen
I am in my forth year of Biotechnology degree. This year I am doing my industrial placement at MedImmune in Cambridge and I work on monoclonal antibody aggregation project. I really enjoyed iGEM project. This was definitely one of the best experience undergraduate students can get :) I can’t wait to meet all the teams in Boston and see their great projects and ideas!
Stephen Lam
University of Aberdeen
Stephen is in his fourth year of study of Immunology with a year’s Industrial placement at Aberdeen University. He is currently on placement at Novartis, Basel and investigating B cell activation signalling pathways. He joined the iGEM team to develop his knowledge of molecular biology and laboratory skills. His interests include ceilidh dancing, badminton and learning German. He used to play Triangle for his local band 'The Duffel Coats'
Christina McLeman
BSc Hons Geology (2:1, 2006), BSc Physics (1st, 2010), PhD Physics, Maths and Hydrology (1st Year): University of Aberdeen
I finished my undergraduate degree in physics this year and moved straight into doing a PhD at the University of Aberdeen. My research is interdisciplinary between physics, maths and hydrology. I am looking at applying mathematical models to river networks in order to study their fractal properties. I hope to find a link between the geometric and physical properties in order to predict and control river behaviour. I also take extra classes in maths and evening classes in German. I really enjoyed working on the iGEM project over the summer months and I am looking forward to presenting our results at the iGEM jamboree in Boston this November!
Ben Porter
BSc Hons Physics (4th Year): University of Aberdeen
My fourth year of physics has just begun, which has brought a medley of new challenges for me to get stuck into.  The best of these is my honours project where I'll be putting solid oxides through the path of fire to test their mettle (or performing ac impedance spectroscopy if you listen to my supervisor).  iGEM was an experience without comparison and I'm looking forward to joining all of the other teams in Boston.
Maragaret-Ann Seger
BS Electrical Engineering (2nd Year): Olin College
Margaret-Ann attends Olin College.
Liz Threlkeld
BS Maths and Biology (2nd Year): Olin College
I am currently a second year student at Olin College of Engineering in Needham, Massachusetts.  I haven't declared a major yet, but it will be a sweet self-designed combination of engineering, biology, and applied mathematics when I get around to it.  But really, there are only three things you need to know about me: I have eight cats, I am awkward at all else, and I have a freakish obsession with math.""

iGEM 2010
iGEM at Aberdeen Uni
About the University
King's College Chapel,
University of Aberdeen
- Basil Spence
Founded in 1495 by William Elphinstone, Bishop of Aberdeen and Chancellor of Scotland, Aberdeen is Scotland's third oldest university, and the fifth most ancient in the whole United Kingdom.
Much of the original King's College still stands today, a famous historic landmark beloved of generations of students, academics, and local people who are inspired by the finest examples of medieval and Renaissance craftwork remaining anywhere in Scotland.
The department of Physics at the University of Aberdeen has a long and illustrious history, and former staff include great physicists such as James Clerk Maxwell.  The department is research-orientated, and does world-class research in both experimental and theoretical areas.  Research topics cover classical areas such as general relativity, solid-state physics and dynamical systems and chaos, and the department is also active in multi-disciplinary topics, especially the application of physics to biology.
Systems biology research at the University of Aberdeen is centred on a growing number of interdisciplinary interactions between biologists, physicists, computing scientists and engineers. This thriving network of collaborations is underpinned by significant Research Council funding. The research teams are focused on systems biological investigations at a variety of scales, from the molecular and cell level, to modelling of cells and tissues, whole populations and continent-wide environmental processes.
The application of mathematical and systems biology approaches, ranging from applied dynamics through stochastic to qualitative reasoning is enabling swift progress to be made in understanding complex biological, medical and environmental systems. The Systems Biology Research Programme is constantly seeking to broaden this portfolio by applying this powerful suite of approaches to new areas of investigation.
Newcastle
In July, four of our team members travelled to Newcastle to meet the other teams for the UK iGEM get together. A brilliant time was had by all as we presented the AyeSwitch, discussed the technicalities of Biobrick construction and holding eggs up with marshmallows and wooden skewers.

Team - Illuminati
We are the Illuminati - a multidisciplinary team based at the University of Edinburgh , consisting of ten students, two advisors, and two supervisors from various different backgrounds including biology, engineering, informatics, and design. Assembled during the summer of 2010 to take part in the worldwide synthetic biology competition known as iGEM , we consider ourselves to be a fun and eclectic bunch, if perhaps somewhat eccentric as well.
Supervisors
    Chris French     Alistair Elfick
Advisors
    Emma Frow     Jane Calvert
    With special thanks to Damian Barnard, Kelly Joblin, Sahreena, Eugene, and Joe.
Students
    Marta Bereska     Matthew Coombes     Hannah Fraser     Sarah Hunt     Maria Kowal
    Meng Lu     Richard Partridge-Hicks     William Rostain     Donal Stewart     John Wilson-Kanamori
Contact us at: igem2010 (at) ed (dot) ac (dot) uk
Our introductory pages also contain more information on the University of Edinburgh, as well as a gallery of some of the more amusing photographs and videos taken of us during the iGEM summer.
Throughout this wiki there are words in bold that indicate a relevance to human aspects. It will become obvious that human aspects are a part of almost everything in iGEM.

The Darwin Building in the King's Buildings campus is part of the Darwin-Rutherford-Swann (DRS) complex, which is in turn home to the School of Biological Sciences of the University of Edinburgh . The 2010 iGEM team has taken over the Honours Room on the top floor of the building, where a bank of twelve computers and a small kitchen provide a base of operations, and conduct wet lab activities in the French Laboratory on the floor below. Despite the high levels of asbestos within the architecture and its generally ugly 1930s decor, it is now our home away from home.
The University of Edinburgh was founded in 1582 as the fourth university in Scotland and the sixth in the United Kingdom. It has long enjoyed a reputation for academic excellence, having been at the forefront of the 18th century Age of Enlightenment and now a member of leading international research associations including the Coimbra Group , the LERU , and Universitas 21 . Over the years, such famous alumni as Adam Smith, Charles Darwin, Alexander Graham Bell, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, Robert Louis Stevenson, and Sir Walter Scott have emerged from its halls.
The modern University of Edinburgh has three main faculties, amongst them the College of Science and Engineering , which are in turn split up into twenty-one schools including the School of Biological Sciences , the School of Engineering , and the School of Informatics . With the expansion in topics of study over its long history, the university is now split over seven campuses throughout the city, including the King's Buildings campus that houses a world-leading Biology department.
Throughout this wiki there are words in bold that indicate a relevance to human aspects. It will become obvious that human aspects are a part of almost everything in iGEM.

Throughout this wiki there are words in bold that indicate a relevance to human aspects. It will become obvious that human aspects are a part of almost everything in iGEM.
Attributions and Contributions
For iGEM 2010, the description of each project must clearly attribute work done by the team and distinguish it from work done by others, including the host labs, advisors, and instructors. And thus, with no further ado...
The BioBrick constructs for the BRIDGE protocol were mostly made by Maria, except for the cat gene made by Geraldine Avila.
sacB was characterised by Lu and Hannah, cat by Maria.
The BRIDGE protocol was adapted from the Gene Bridges Red/ET protocol by Maria. All control experiments were designed and carried out by Maria.
The bacterial BRIDGEs (FORTH) project was divided into 6 parts:
- The wild type luciferase was characterised and submitted by Will and Lu.
- The red luciferase was mutated, characterised and submitted by Will.
- The LuxAB-LumP fusion was successfully completed and submitted by Richard.
- The green light sensor was designed and made by Will and Lu.
- The red light sensor was reconstructed and characterised by Richard.
- The LovTAP characterisation experiment was designed and carried out by Marta.
The modelling components of the project were undertaken by John and Donal, building on previous unrelated work by Ty Thomson (the BioBrick framework and the core repressilator). John created the genomic and bacterial models, while Donal worked on the tools and the signalling model.
The human practices component of the project was the responsibility of Matt, with guidance from Emma Frow and Jane Calvert. The entire team (and others as appropriate) pitched in whenever possible, for example in helping to define terms and write self-reflective essays. Robbie Henderson helped out greatly with the future applications component.
The Epic was the brainchild of Maria and Hannah, who were supported in writing it by John and Richard.
Poster, presentation, and wiki design was done by Matt.
The whole team were responsible for the content of the above, but particular kudos go to Maria, Matt, and John (the presentation team!).
Credit (and discredit) for wiki implementation goes to John.
Gilbert was thrown about. Kenny cheered us on. Fun was had by all.

The 2010 SJTU-Bio-X iGEM team is composed of many fancy guys who held great passion toward biology, especially the emerging field of synthetic biology. Though we may come from similar background, we have various interests and strong points. We are happy that we cooperate with each other and fulfill our achievement together. We make it!
Recalling the first time we met up in a small classroom, the enthusiasm filled the whole room. We even came up with small crazy ideas at the first discussion. Later on, the team met up once a week, shared with each other the new thoughts upon intensive paper reading. To our great surprise, we almost had one idea a time raised by various team members during the meeting.
The day on which we decided upon our final project idea, we held a meeting lasting a whole day, with our advisors as well as our former team members. It is a really hard decision for us to carry out the eukaryote part. The silence was broken when one of the team member spoke out a word, “it is the time that we no longer follow others and try something new in the unclaimed field, however difficult it is!” Soon, the atmosphere changed as if he came up with something that is under the heart of everyone. Thus, we finally made up our mind to engage our eukaryote part into the whole OA project.
When we got the cheerful news from our team members that are responsible for the cell experiment that we have proved to some extent the effectiveness of our designed circuit in the eukaryote system, we celebrated together upon the determination of taking the challenge at the beginning.

Attributions and Contributions:
All of the experiment, modeling, and even part of lab management work has been done by our team members. Our instructors and advisors helped by offering useful advice and information. Our host lab helped by offering the equipment and consumptive materials (e.g. restriction enzymes) needed to perform experiments. Here we express our greatest thankfulness to them.
Bio-X Center, as our host lab
Bio-X Institute, Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU) is recombined and founded in 2005. The director of Bio-X Institute now is Professor HE Lin, who is an academician of the Chinese Academy of Sciences.

私たちは京都の松ヶ崎にある京都工芸繊維大学(Kyoto Institute of Technology)の学生です。
工繊大は、京の伝統文化との関わりが深く、伝統を重んじる大学です。国立の理系単科大であり、学部は工芸科学部と先端科学技術学部の2つからなります。また、本学には、世界有数の系統数を誇る「ショウジョウバエ遺伝資源センター」（""Drosophila Genetic Resource Center (DGRC)""）が設置されており、世界中の実験室からのショウジョウバエ系統株を収集し維持するとともに、世界各地の研究者に多くの系統株を提供しています。ショウジョウバエは生命科学の研究において非常に重要なモデル生物であり、遺伝学の研究において広く用いられる生物です。そのため本学は遺伝学の分野に優れた実績を持っています。
さらに、京都工芸繊維大学では科学だけでなく芸術分野の研究にも取り組んでおり、大学のテーマに「科学と芸術の出会い」を掲げています。 したがって、本学はiGEMの理念とも通じる面があるといえるでしょう。
>>京都工芸繊維大学 HP
iGEM参加に協力してくださった工繊大の方々のHPです。
各研究室の皆様ならびに大学関係者の皆様に感謝します。
>>染色体工学研究室 >>微生物工学研究室 >>昆虫バイオメディカル教育研究センター >>応用生物学部門
京都工芸繊維大学iGEMチーム“KIT－Kyoto”は今年が初参加です。2010年3月17日に発足され、当時チームメンバーは５名でした。しかし現在は学部一回生2名、二回生4名、三回生7名の計13名、大学院生7名、教員2名の合計22人で活発に活動しています。学部生は主に生物系、美術系の学生で構成されており、芸術学的観点も積極的に取り入れています。
私たちはiGEM参加にあたって以下の3つの目標を掲げています。
(1)iGEMの活動を通して生物学への興味と理解をより充実したものにしたい。
(2)世界中の学生と議論をし、交流を深めたい。
(3)私たちの大学はあまり有名ではないので、iGEMで輝かしい功績を勝ち取りより広く知られる大学にしたい。

Home > About us >Our Team
Language : English / Japanese
We are students of '''KIT''-''Kyoto Institute of Technology''.
Our University KIT is one of the National Universities located in Matsugasaki Kyoto, Japan. Kyoto is a very famous city of Japan. It had been Japanese capital for over millenium, and its history has built up its unique, traditional culture.    KIT has ties with this traditional culture and industries in Kyoto and has been advancing knowledge in engineering, design, and textile science. By pursuing ‘human-friendly practical science,’ KIT and its two predecessors have been serving our society for over a century.   KIT has Drosophila Genetic Resource Center(DGRC). The DGRC collects Drosophila stocks from laboratories all over the world, maintains them, and provides them to researchers upon request. There are only three Drosophila resorce center in the world !  Drosophila is an essential model organism for life science research as a result of its long-term use in genetic research.  KIT has great achievements in this genetic field.  And, KIT has departments not only of science but also of arts. It is rare in Japanese national universities! So KIT has philosophy that we will develop an academic community, which aspires to the fusion of science and art cultivated from the foundation of KIT.  So it is no doubt that KIT is the best university to participate iGEM projects!    KIT encourages students to participate in internships, experience the realm where design and science converge and take part in projects with our partner universities abroad. KIT also promotes collaboration in business and research with industries. The close rapport maintained with area industries over the past 100 years has allowed us to continue to have our fingers on the pulse of Kyoto design and technology.   Finally, KIT financially supports our team.
>>Kyoto Institute of Technology And, these are the members of our group. We express our thanks to all and every one of them for their cooperation. >>Yamaguchi Lab Group >>Izawa Lab Group >>Inoue Lab Group >>KIT Applied Biology Section
Kyoto Institute of Technology iGEM team ""KIT - Kyoto"" is the first participation this year. We got interested in the poster presented in iGEM by Tokyo Institute of Technology at summer school of biological science held in Japan. And decided to participate in iGEM 2010. It was started on March 17, 2010, and the team member was five people in those days. To make our iGEM team KIT-Kyoto, We got contact with some iGEM team in Japan and collected many information of iGEM 2010. Philosophy in making our team is a combination of biology and design.And now we have 2 students from design engineering department and 11 students from applied biology department in our iGEM team.
Our expectations and hope for iGEM 2010 are 3 points.
(1)We would like to promote better understanding and interest for biology through activity in iGEM 2010.
(2)We would like to discuss with many students all over the world, and we would like to make friends with all around the world.
(3)Our University, Kyoto Institute of Technology, KIT is not so large and famous enough, so we wanna make it world wide famous by achievement of brilliant results at iGEM 2010.
Details concerning the design of the team logo are links below. >>DesignNote Week1

The host lab never worked on hydrogen production; it helped with basic protocols and materials. It works with toxin-antitoxin systems, which gave us the idea to use one to kill the escaping bacteria.
The advisors Laurence Van Melderen, Johan Timmermans and Gilles Vanwalleghem helped with the design and refinements of the project; they also gave technical advices. Pierre-Alexandre Drèze brought his technical expertise to our PCRs and manipulation of E.coli.
All the students were involved in the choice of project and design; Justine Laverdeur, Baptiste Dumont,Aurelie Merckx, Thomas Gosset, Denis Loozen, Alix Delville, Maxime Iwaszko, Hubert Michaux were the wetlab team and tried to build this awesome machine.
Jonathan Frisch and Justine Laverdeur worked on modeling of hydrogen production and cell death
Eleanor Miller, Yasemin Onal and Quentin Hiernaux were our extra-scientific experts, working on the human practice and economic part of the project.

Dr Wendy Smith gave us introductory lab session and taught us about the lab safety. She also supervised us throughout our stay in the lab (often into the the early hours :-)
Dr Matthew Pocock helped us with the presentation design and talk.
Prof. Colin Harwood and Dr Jem Stach suggested the antisense RNA approach for the SR1 BioBrick Part. They also helped us in writing the cloning strategies.
Dr Colin Davie provided advice and access to the Civil Engineering labs to prepare and crack concrete.
Mr Goksel Misirili provided help and expertise with modelling.
Details of this work can be found on the Solution , Modelling and Lab book pages. This work is unrelated to the work done by the labs of our instructors and advisors.

What we did
This year, the University of Illinois Bioware Team worked with genes from Salmonella and E. coli to create a bioremediation system that removes arsenic and gold from solution.  We also improved upon the bacterial decoder project from last year, and worked to incorporate the two projects.  More information can be found on our Project page.
Where we're from
Consisting of 31,173 undergraduates and 10,322 graduate and professional students from all 50 states, the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign is a world leader in research, teaching and public engagement.  The University is distinguished by its breadth of programs, overarching academic excellence, and internationally renowned faculty.  In 2007, $473,711,000 was spent on research and development in science and engineering.
Some interesting facts about UIUC:
• In 2010, UIUC was ranked as the number 9 public university in U.S. News & World Report's America's Best Colleges.

Contributions
Undergraduates
The 2010 UIUC-Illinois iGEM team is primarily self-administrated. Three returning members (Meagan Musselman, Steve Waltersdorf, and Francis Lee) organized recruiting, applications, and choosing of a new team. They then lead discussion leading to project selection. Each member has contributed significantly through lab work as well as administrative efforts, particularly fundraising and grant writing (Tom Hsaio, Francis Lee, and Steve Waltersdorf), publicity (Amanda Chang), financial organization (Bob Cooper), coordinating the wiki (Matt Entler) and writing newsletters (Erin Borchardt).
Advisors
We have four advisors who have been incredibly helpful and supportive. Starting during the spring and continuing until the Jamboree, the team has had bi-weekly hour long meetings with Dr. Chris Rao, Dr. Yong-Su Jin, Joanne Manaster, and Courtney Evans.
Dr. Rao and Dr. Jin have been extremely helpful in providing advice on trouble shooting lab procedures and structuring the presentation.
Dr. Jin has been gracious enough to support our work within his own lab space, and and has even taken steps to ensure that the next year's team will continue to have their own dedicated lab space.
Courtney Evans has been extremely helpful with administrative questions and providing contacts.
Joanne Manaster has helped arrange outreach events such as GAMES camp and the Surrounded By Science TV Show. She has been very supportive in this area and discussed with our team the ethical implications of synthetic biology and how best to interact with the public.
Bacterial strains were donated by the Slaugh and Vanderpool labs, located on the University of Illinois - Urbana Champaign campus. We have also contacted several other professors across the UIUC campus who have all been extremely gracious and willing to discuss research with us.
Further Support
Our team would not be where we are today without the support of The Institute for Genomic Biology and its director Doctor Harris Lewin. The IGB has continually supported our undergraduate research though funding and lab space.
We have received generous product donations particularly from Promega, and also from Thermo Fisher, Corning, Midsci, and Life Technologies. Please see our home page for logos and links!
We are also extremely grateful for other on campus support that we have received from the Design Council or College of Engineering and The Student Organization Resource Fee (SORF).
Collaboration
The University of Illinois Bioware Team has collaborated with a number of different iGEM teams this year.
UIUC Software
We have worked closely with our sister team in many aspects, including recruitment, system testing and diagnostics, fundraising, etc.  Neither team would be where they are now without the significant amount of collaboration that happened this year.
Project Advice:
Email threads and video conferences were held with Peking University and Purdue University to discuss problems and to trade suggestions and advice.
Surveys:
The team participated in surveys hosted by the University of Warsaw team, the Middle East Technical University Software team, and the University of Edinburgh team to assist in their own bioethical projects.

Lisza Bruder - Team Leader
I am entering my second year as an iGEM participant and the final year of my biochemistry studies at the University of Lethbridge.  After the amazing experience last year, I am now team leader to help guide the new enthusiastic members and the development of the project.  At the University of Lethbridge I have discovered my fascination and love for proteins and research and has decided to pursue a career in research by continuing into graduate school when my degree is complete.
Justin Vigar - Summer Student
I am one of the few left handed people on the team! This is my first year participating in the iGEM competition. I'm a fourth year biochemistry major, and I am very excited to be working full-time for the Lethbridge iGEM team this summer. When not in the lab I downhill/freeride mountain bike, ride motocross, skydive, and anything else that induces high amounts of adrenaline. These risk seeking hobbies of mine seem to always result in me being hospitalized. But I guess you gotta' play to win. I also play lead guitar in a band. I can often be found listening to Zeppelin, Clapton, B.B. King, Dylan, Buddy Guy, Neil Young, etc, etc, etc...
Mackenzie Coatham
Mackenzie Coatham is going into her third year of biochemistry studies at the University of Lethbridge.  This is her second year participating in iGEM and as lab coordinator and a member of the ethics  team she hopes to gain further experience in the growing field of synthetic biology.  As an undergraduate, she works in the summer in the biochemistry lab of HJ Wieden.  She has been known to deny the fact that she is a major gLeek!
Anthony Vuong
“I, Anthony Vuong, was born and raised in Lethbridge. I graduated from Winston Churchill High School in 2008 and am currently in my second year of a B. Sc. degree majoring in Biology at the University of Lethbridge. I attend weekly Choy Lee Fut Kung Fu classes with Lethbridge Choy Lee Fut and am also part of the Lethbridge Lion Dance Team operating through the Lethbridge Chinese Free Mason’s Hung Mun Athletics Association. In my free time, I enjoy watching and playing tennis. I can draw fairly well; however, I have not picked up a drawing pencil in a few years. In fact, my picture is a self portrait I did in my senior year of high school. I have always enjoyed science and believe that iGEM is a great way to expose myself to the new expanding field of synthetic biology while gaining some lab experience along the way.“
Josh Sorell
""I grew up in the magnificent city of Calgary where wild people roam and animals sit civilized. Then promptly at the age of 19, I began academicizing at the center for academics, the University of Lethbridge. I left my established abode for this center; for it gave me credit for the AP courses I took at William Aberhart High School and had small class sizes. I am studying biochemistry and am in my 3rd year, of which aquatic biology actually was my favorite class because I had the opportunity to learn so many specifics about North American aquatic organisms. What I hope to get out of the iGEM experience is knowledge about molecular biology and satisfaction on how I helped forward the field of synthetic biology. In my free time I play Starcraft 2 from Blizzard Entertainment, subsidiary of Activision and also try to build sweet devices like a tesla coil. Coiled in my free time lies another beast which is my favorite food, ribs, they are so good.""
Harland Brandon
My name is Harland Brandon. Some people like to refer to me with a variety of variations on my name, however, I personally prefer Harlando. I am going into my third year majoring in Biochemistry at the University of Lethbridge. This is my first year on the school iGEM team and I am fulling enjoying it. I am from Lethbridge and my goal in life is to become a doctor. My biggest fears include; papercuts, centipedes, anything to do with running naked, and a world without chocolate. Aside from these fears I enjoy golfing, eating, drawing, gaming, running clothed, chocolate, and the little mints left on your pillow at hotels.
Alix Blackshaw
Hey iGEMers! My name is Alix, and this is my third year participating in the iGEM competition with the University of Lethbridge team. Obviously I really enjoy being part of this group and I am excited to head up the fundraising and ethics committees. I just graduated with my neuroscience degree and am looking forward to a year of traveling through Central America. I plan to learn a new language, volunteer in as many countries as possible and make some new friends. The final very important thing you should know about me is: I like chocolate and I like peanut butter, but I hate it when the two are combined!
Katherine Gzyl
Hi I am Katherine. In the fall I will be entering my third year in biochemistry at the U of L. This is my first year in iGEM and I am really excited to be part of the team! My goal in life is to create mini monopolies from coffee shops that will eventually turn into a centralized giant monopoly that will take over the world. To assist me in this I will have to create fire-breathing dragons. Oh I also enjoy snowboarding and the sun.
Dominic Mudiayi
I was born in the D.R.Congo and I am a currently a third year student at the University of Lethbridge majoring in Biology. This is my first year with the U of L iGEM team, and so far my experiences have been exhilirating. I am in awe of the infinite possibilities in the emerging field of Synthetic biology and I am looking forward to an action packed year in lab!  Aside from school commitments, iGEM and a deep fascination for translation factors (namely EF-Tu), I thoroughly enjoy playing a quick game of chess and numerous sports; I am an avid long jumper on the University of Lethbridge Track and Field team.
Tyler Forster
Once upon a time in land very similar to Edmonton, Alberta, lived two ordinary people with an extraordinary dream. This dream was to produce a son who would go on to contribute to the invigorating field of synthetic biology. On a beautiful morning in a time very similar the year of 1991, this dream, of a not yet existent field of science, took root with the birth of a son. He was known throughout the land as Tyler Forster. For many years, the dream lay low as it gathered force. In a year very similar to 2010, the time had come for the dream's full power to be displayed, and so Tyler got involved with iGEM while in his first year at a very similar institution to the University of Lethbridge. As part of the master plan, Tyler's parents subconsciously interested him into bird-watching, soccer, volleyball and especially basketball. Although the story is far from over, the rest of the story has yet to play out. And so dear children, I will leave you to sleep in peace, secure in the knowledge that greater things are still to be done in this city. *To be continued, but probably not*
Graduate Students
Adam Smith - Lab Technician
Adam Smith moved to Lethbridge in September of 2001 to study Biochemistry at the University of Lethbridge. After graduating with his Masters of Science in Biochemistry from the University of Lethbridge in 2008, Adam moved into the role of Research Assistant in Dr. Steven Mosimann’s (his graduate supervisor) biochemistry laboratory. He is excited to be joining Dr. HJ Wieden (his graduate co-supervisor) on a part-time foray into the world of iGEM and is particularly pleased to be experiencing the field of synthetic biology in its infancy. When not in the lab, Adam tries to balance outdoor activities such as skiing and hiking with vigorous sessions of sitting on the couch watching ‘Friends’ re-runs.
Nathan Puhl - Graduate Advisor
I have been involved with iGEM at the U of L since the spring of 2007, first as an undergraduate and now as an advisor. Through iGEM I have had the opportunity to travel to Boston twice and attend Synthetic Biology 4.0 in Hong Kong. I graduated from the U of L in 2009 with a major in biochemistry and am currently transitioning from a M.Sc. in  Biology to medical school at the University of Alberta. Unlike my fellow iGEMers, I don't have the energy to come up with a funny twist to my bio, but I'll give you
""Interesting Nathan fact #36""
I created the U of L iGEM 2007 logo and the 2008 logo .
David Franz - Graduate Advisor
Originally from a farm in southern Alberta, Dave came to Lethbridge in 2000 temporarily for a one year transfer program in Engineering... ten years later, Dave is still in Lethbridge, and is now is a 3rd year PhD candidate in organic chemistry.  Dave as received both his BSc in chemistry and MSc. in mathematical biology from the University of Lethbridge.  He has been involved in both the 2007 and 2008 Lethbridge iGEM teams in an advisory role.  Dave enjoys many outdoor activities, ranging from golf to hiking and skiing.
Fan Mo - Graduate Advisor
Fan is from the crazy, funny Wieden Lab. This is her second year in both the M. Sc program and as a supervisor in iGEM.  She can often be found experimenting with radioactivity while listening to “The Phantom of the Opera”.  In her free time when she isn’t running any experiments, she often tries to train the “mice” (the rest of the Wieden team) to sing songs from classic Disney movies. She also spends quite a bit of time keeping the mouse who shall remain nameless (Jeff Fischer) away from her food, mainly cookies.
Jeffrey Fischer - Graduate Advisor
Hi all, I'm Jeff. Currently I'm a PhD candidaate in HJ Wieden's lab, working on the prokaryotic protein synthesis machinery. Perpetually on a quest for caffeine (do science faster and with more energy), my research focuses on novel translation factors of unkown function. Outside the lab, I enjoy playing soccer, watching soccer (World Cup Year!!!), occasionally fishing, hiking, and can often be found having a beer with friends and family.
Hamid Sadeghi - Graduate Student
I am an Irani PhD student in Marc Roussel Lab working on mathematical modeling of biochemical process. My interest to systems Biology concept made me to take iGEM course and join HJ wonderful team. I have some experiences in molecular cytogenetics of fungi which dealing with chromosomes. It is believed that synthetic biology will affect all areas of industry in near future.
Supervisors
Hans-Joachim Wieden
Originally from Germany I moved to Canada in 2005 to start a research group on the structure and function of the bacterial protein synthesis machinery, a cellular process targeted by over 50% of the known antibiotics. I am intrigued by the molecular design and function of this essential bio-nanomachine. I try to unravel the underlying design principles in order to enable the rational design and engineering of novel bio-nanomachines. I am essentially asking the question if such novel bio-machines can be constructed from simple and fundamental principles or are these assemblies just to complex. Well and that’s why it was extremely easy to rope me into doing iGEM.
A. William Smith
Smith has a BS chem, BFA movement, BA mathematics, BM music theory and composition, MFA interdisciplinary, and PhD History of Theatre, History of Art. He started the New Media Department at the U of L teaching the first class in 1999. He loves getting out of his comfort zone [and encouraging others to get out of theirs].

Dongchan Yang
  Hallo! I'm third grade undergraduate student of KAIST. I'm double majoring in BBE(Bio and Brain Engineering) and BS(Biological Science). I'm also interested in the CS(computer science). I'm interested in the Virology and Bioinformatics. More speciually, my interest is coronavirus. Generally, coronavirus just cause mild cold for human. But it caused severe pandemic(SARS) in 2002. I want to prevent spreading of novel pandemic to understand the mechanism how coronavirus could cause severe pandemic. My works in this team are to suggest biological pathway based on my BS background, to analyze bioinformation from many bioinformatics database, and to design novel protein and its peptide sequence and nucleotide sequence.
Eun Soo Kim
  Hello~! My name is Eun-Soo Kim, and I'm 20-year-old junior of KAIST, Korea. My major is 'Bio and Brain Engineering'. At KAIST, I'm learning various studies including 'Bioinformatics', 'Systems biotechnology', and 'Bio-signal processing'. Especially, because I want to study about fusion biotechnology, I'm really interested in synthetic biology. So, to participate this 'iGEM' competition is not only a really good chance but also very meaningful for my future. This experience will be very helpful for my growth, and I hope that I will grow up through this experience. I'm not afraid because I have friends who have same dreams of mine. I believe that our team will do a really good job, and I'll do my best to see our team's works get results.
  See you at Jamboree~!! :)
Soo Hwan Kim
  Hello~ My name is Soo-hwan Kim. I'm a undergraduate student of KAIST. My major is Bio and Brain Engineering. In my major class ""System Biotechnology"", I learned about synthetic biology, and I heard about iGEM competition. Because synthetic biology is very interesting for me, I am also interested in iGEM competition. These days not only I but also our team research into our project very hard. Through this competition, I want to find my aptitude and passion, and finally, i want to do something that makes a difference.
Best foot forward!!

>>Team KAIST-Korea
 Our iGEM 2010 team is composed of 12 students majoring in Bio and Brain Engineering and 3 advisors from KAIST. It all started when one of our advisors, Prof. Choi, gave us a news article regarding iGEM competition. It immediately grabbed our attention and flamed our passion for research. The opportunity could not have been timelier: we, juniors, were focusing on system biology, synthetic biology, and bioinformatics at the time.  This is the first participation in iGEM from our institute. We are receiving generous support from the university and getting lots of attention. We will definitely go all the way and put our best effort. We will become the leader in this competition and carry the legacy. GO! GO! KAIST!
>> KAIST
  Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) was established in 1971 as the nation’s first graduate school specializing in science and engineering education and research. The school’s founding was a catalyst for Korea’s rapid rise from a producer of light industry goods to a world leader in high-technology industries. The political leadership in the 1960s and 1970s singled out education, work ethics and technological advancement as the means of transforming Korea from an underdeveloped agrarian society into an emerging economy equipped with technological and industrial competitiveness. KAIST was founded under a special law with government funding and initially staffed with a number of Korean engineering and science faculty educated in the United States. Research emphasis from the outset has been put on both theoretical and applied studies. KAIST continues to be Korea’s foremost center for mid- to long-term strategic R&D projects with national and international significance. The University has pioneered the establishment of competitive graduate school programs in Korea. Over the past four decades, KAIST has evolved into a global research university. The University’s strong faculty conducts internationally recognized research in cooperation with academic institutions and industries all over the world. KAIST offers generous grants and fellowships to international students, promoting Korea as a global educational power.
>> Bio and Brain Engineering Dept
  It is our mission at the Department of Bio and Brain Engineering to cultivate specialized talent equipped to create new knowledge and added value in the fields of Bioengineering and Brain Engineering, which will lead the way for future societies by standing at the nexus of life sciences, the medical sciences, and engineering.  The Department of Bio and Brain Engineering opened its doors in 2002 embracing the mission of donor Moon-Soul Chung who said, “Foster talent and develop technology that will feed and support future.”  Analogous departments at prestigious universities around the world began at similar times indicating the cutting-edge nature of this department.
>> KI Building
  The Chunghi & Byiung Jun (BJ) Park KAIST Institute Building (KI Building) was established for researchers to secure physical proximity to be able to exchange ideas and opinions and cooperate in research activities by a generous contribution from Dr. Byiung Jun (BJ) Park and Mrs. Chunghi Park, and Korean government. The KI Building has 21,120 square meters of total floor space with five floors above ground and one underground. The exterior will symbolize KAIST's vision and challenging spirit, and, at the same time, a flexibility and openness will be emphasized in the design of the interior. The building is located in a place that is easily accessible for researchers of all disciplines including biotechnology, IT, nanotechnology, and eco-technology. It is also ideally situated not only for our students and faculty, but also visitors from outside, because the KAIST Institutes will have a lot of external contacts for the exhibition of research results, information sharing, and intercultural activities. The KI building embodies KAIST's commitment to presenting a new model of creative and interdisciplinary research and to becoming a globally-competitive research-oriented university.

Introducing the Missouri Miners
Our History
The Missouri S&T iGEM team was founded under the guidance of Dr. Katie Shannon in 2006.  Dr. Shannon learned about the iGEM program at MIT through research associates from Missouri Western State University. The Massachusetts Institute of Technology had pioneered a collaborative research effort to use engineering principles to solve biological problems.  Their approach, coined Synthetic Biology, is based on creating a library of interchangeable genetic parts for bacteria and yeast. MIT expanded this project under the International Genetically Engineered Machines banner (iGEM for short). The first competition took place in the summer of 2004 with 5 teams. MIT is expecting 180+ teams in 2010.
The Missouri S&T team began with two simple projects of building a biological clock in Escherichia coli and an ethanol sensor in yeast. The projects acted as a test bed while students learned and perfected lab techniques. The team initially split into two research groups, one pursuing the clock while the other began work on an ethanol sensor and the two projects were presented together at the 2007 iGEM Jamboree. The clock project was retired after the 2007 Jamboree, and the ethanol sensor was continued for  2008 iGEM competitions. After the 2008 competition the sensor was retired and the team began its most ambitious project yet.
As the 2008 iGEM competition was wrapping up, some students on the team proposed a new project. Using genes from Geobacter sulfurreducens that shuttled electrons outside of the cell, the team wanted to construct an aerobic microbial fuel cell by moving the genes from G. sulfurreducens to E. coli.

Peter Zhu Is a sophomore at Duke University and a North Carolina local. Though he's not completely sure yet what to do with his life, he is leaning more and more towards Biomedical Engineering and pre-Law. When he's not busy with the routines of life, he is listening to the Billboard Top 100, playing Chopin Preludes, searching for new places to eat, playing tennis, studying poker, and gaming Starcraft/DoTA. Peter is a regular at Bail Hai Mongolian Grill, Lime and Basil Vietnamese Pho, and Five Guy's Burgers---bacon cheeseburger with all toppings of course.
Peter is also a philosophical person and is very much interested in the philosophies of man (as demonstrated from his staring philosophically into the sea in this picture.)

My Profile:
Chen Liao,       Room 418, Key Lab of Quantum Information, CAS, East Campus, USTC Hefei, Anhui 230026, China, liaochen@mail.ustc.edu.cn
I’ve just began my first year in the Optics and Optical Engineering program as a master candidate at University of Science and Technology of China. I became interested in iGEM because I found it a great chance to learn synthetic biology. Since iGEM is a student-run and student-manage programe which encourages students both to work collectively in a team and work individually to complete one's own task, it is a great experience to exercise my team working ability as well as creative ideas. In the last months, especially the summer, I worked with students from different disciplines to design and implement our project together and have learnt a lot from them. It is rather a wonderful experience to work with all team members. (^▽^)
As a student of department of physics, my research area is development of first principle theory and implementation of LCAO (Linear Combination of Atomic Orbitals) algorithms. As a member of LiXin He's group , I have successfully implemented atomic force calculation in LCAO method and my next project is to modify and develop algorithms under condition of  magnetic B field. Besides scientific research, I do sports very often. Basketball is my favorite and my favorite basketball player is Kevin Garnett (K.G.), his professional attitude on the court as well as his individual character in the life impresses me a lot.
Zhen Wang
I am Zhen Wang!
Zhen Wang,       Room 418, Key Lab of Quantum Information, CAS, East Campus, USTC Hefei, Anhui 230026, China.  Email: xqqixp@mail.ustc.edu.cn; wangzhen.ustc@gmail.com;
Hi, I'm Zhen Wang, I mainly work on MoDeL and Database of iGAME. As a member of Lixin He's research group, I focus mainly on calculation of quantum information, quantum correlation and entanglement.
You might have noticed that my address is same as Liao's. Yes, we are from the same Research Group, and the same department, too. It will be boring if I repeat all the information again, so I am going to write some experience of myself participating iGEM2010.
As a student majoring physics, it is hard for me to believe that I can participate in a biology project. Luckily, to my great surprise, these two areas are not so far apart. Modeling and analyzing skills of physics can also be used in biology, and dry project always means a lot of coding task, I can handle that, too. Of course, there is plenty of biology I need to learn, but with the help of our instructor and wet team members, I learn it fast. So I want to tell everyone that there's no limit in iGEM, join in and unleash your power!
Kun Jiang
Email: jkdirac@mail.ustc.edu.cn
I am Kun Jiang, the cheif software developer in iGem 2010 USTC_Software team, responsible for designing the global architecture of our software and  developing the ODE Solver module, Berkley database interface module and several simple tools for teammates.
It is my second year of studying in computer applied technology lab of Institute of Plasma Physics Chinese Academy of Sciences as a master candidate. I am interesting in software engineering and Computer Sicence.  Last year I noticed the recruit advertisement of iGem 2010 USTC_Software team in school BBS website. I make the decision to apply immediately. It's really happy for me during those past server months working with our team.
I play Ping Pong most during my spare time, because Ping Pong is a sport emphasizes on speed, skill and acting harmony ability rather than brute force. And I go jogging every day, which i think is a good way to relieve  pressure and keep me in health!
I want to be a brilliant software engineer developing some brilliant works. I gain strong knowledge in software engineering and computer algorithms. IGEM 2010 is one step to my ambitions, it is a important project but not the last project of my engineering life, I wish I would develop more and more softwares in future. If you need help, do not hesitate to contact me please!

I am an undergraduate student in theoretical physics. But I am also interested in chemical physics and biology. In my labotarory, I concentrate on the calculation about transmission in nanostructure. However, biology science is also my favourite. So, I decide to join USTC_Software team of iGem 2010. Now I write database of biology reaction for my team. I love biology, chemistry, physics and decide to devote myself to the research of interdisipline in the future.

vicwong@mail.ustc.edu.cn; victorwangluo@gmail.com;
Hey, I'm Vic, an undergraduate senior student majoring in mathematical statistics. Yet my research field is biology statistics, and that is why I'm here.
For IGEM, I'm mainly responsible for human practice and have been giving lectures as well as other promotions on both synthesis biology and IGAM. It is this special experience that has not only made my college life amazing, but also presented me with a broader view of biology. Besides working for IGEM, I've also been researching biology statistics, including bioinformatics and biology networks.
My goal is to be a biostatistician in the future, on which I'm gonna keep putting effort. Now I'm applying for an opportunity to study as a biostatistics PhD. Good luck to me, huh? : )

Hi,I am Jue, a Math majored senior student. As the boundaries among different disciplines of science are now blurring, I want to handle the ideology of maths to arrive at a higher standpoint to try to understand the principle of life. iGEM provides us with such a good state to learn from utilization.
In this group, I am the unique girl among nine boys, and the most frequently spoken of mine is ""Oh, it's my duty to get some soy sauce! "" Strange, huh?  The  connotation of it is not words but meanings. Those guys are too gentle to arrange me doing something of coding.So I am more involved in clerical works, I design the team uniform and our logo,arrange the scheduling and get in touch with sponsors and alumni connection. My life is full of unpredictable tasks, who can tell me what is the next?

During my 2 years’ journey in the nano world, I got to know iGEM and joined in USTC Software team with great honor. Just as NEW YORK TIMES says, iGEM is a Do-It-Yourself Genetic Engineering Program. I am strongly attracted by this idea and cannot help imaging the science fiction picture where our daily life is changed by our genetic machine. It is unforgettable to have a brainstorm with talents from different academic background and turn our imagines into reality. Thanks to iGEM, I experienced a new trip in the synthetic biology and benefited a lot from my partners. Also, to compete against more than 1,000 other students from 100 schools, including many top-flight institutions is exciting.
I love traveling and always enjoy trips with my friends. I have a dream that one day I can travel around the world to discover the great scenery make new friends and experience different culture. Sports is also my favorite, I am good at playing football and gifted in table tennis.

Team Overview
Team
This year 10 students started the iGEM USTC Software team: Chen Liao, Zheng Wang, Kun Jiang, Jue Wang, Luojun Wang, Yubo Qi, Zhaoyi Li, Zhengda He, Shangyu Luo and Mort Yao. There are only 8 of us in the picture, while the only female team member, Jue Wang was in Beijing engaging for her TOEFL exam, and Shangyu Luo had gone to Hong Kong for studying in The University of Hong Kong as an exchange student. What a pity! But they will join us at the iGEM 2010 Jamboree.
USTC has formed two IGEM teams this year, one wet lab team and one dry lab team. As many students majoring in biology was attracted to the wet lab team, our team consists of students from other departments, such as Mathematics, Physics, Computer Science and so on. Thanks to our instructors Hao Jiang and Zhaofeng Luo, with their professional instruction, we are guided to decide the project plan, design and implementation.
About iGEM@USTC
The iGEM Team of USTC are the combination of the exact tradition of USTC and the exact vitality of the young. Rigorous daily schoolwork has provided the team members with a solid foundation of basic knowledge, and an innovative spirit enables us to stand on the frontier of the modern science.
In 2007, Jian Zhan, Bo Ding, Rui Ma, Xiaoyu Ma, Yun Zhao, Ziqing Liu and Xiaofeng Su, guided by Prof. Haiyan Liu, Prof. Jiarui Wu and Prof. Zhonghuai Hou, won the ""Best Foundational Technology Prize"" and a Gold Medal, with the project ""Extensible Logic Circuit in Bacteria"" .

Team Cooperation
iGEM 2010 China Meetup Shanghai 5/6th Aug, 2010
On August 5th, teams from 7 top universities in China, SJTU-BioX-Shanghai , ECUST-Shanghai , Peking , Tsinghua , USTC & USTC_Software , ZJU-China , and Sun Yat-sen University all gathered in Shanghai and had a nice day at the iGEM 2010 China Meetup.
The meetup started around 9 with a short speech by Professor Lin He, head of Shanghai Jiao Tong University Bio-X Institute, which hosted the event. Then each team made a presentation displaying their projects and progresses since the summer began, followed by free questioning and discussion time. And when it was near the end of the day, student members had a hour or two to talk and play freely with each other, with a big meal waiting ahead for them.

Cooperation with USTC wet team
It's always a good experience working with our wet team through the whole summer. During the process of iGEM 2010, we learn from each other and help each other to achieve more! This year we cooperate with USTC team in modeling and human practice. Read the following sections for more details.
Modeling
This year the team of USTC focuses on the construction a Host-cell-free Reaction Chamber using Synthetic Biology methods. We help them to visualize an artificial organelle of capacity. For more details, please refer to our wet team's modeling page .
Human Practice
This year, we also had close collaboration with USTC wet team on human practice, for the simple reason that none of us is biology major and we had to resort to biology major fellows for professional advice. Besides, we had several activities together; we presented several campus lectures promoting both synthetic biology and IGEM, and we started our IGEM community together. The collaboration with them not only enhanced the quality of our work, but improved the biology knowledge of our own.
iGEM2010 China Meetup Shanghai
Something amazing happened at Shanghai this summer...
Help with surveys
Penn State & Warsaw Team
This year Penn State iGEM team created a survey about Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs) in Agriculture. The survey included questions about where and when GMOs should be used, GMOs containing a lysis device, and other questions dealing with the use of GMOs. USTC Software iGEMers are happy to be participants in the survey, and we wish a good result will come out! We also help team Warsaw fill out their survey forms.

Because we had ambitious project and very little time we adopted a shift based work system in the wet lab. Some team members used to come early in the morning and after dinner their experiments were passed to others, who like working late. Our dry lab worked whenever they could.
Attributions by project:
1.RBS Measurement
20 constructs needed for this experiment were cloned by: Kasia Grześ, Ania Puławska, Ania Safray, Cherry Moreno, Milena Bażlekowa, Anna Olchowik. The lab work was supervised by Jarek Pankowski and Kasia Grześ. Kasia's skills and patience were crucial for finishing this stage of the project.
Parts' characterization using FACS measurements were conducted by Cherry Moreno under the supervision of  Michał Lower with some help from other team members.
Parts' characterization using qPCR was performed by Anna Olchowik And Michał Lower. We'd like also thank Piotr Przanowski from Necki Institute, who allowed us access qPCR machine in his lab and advised us about experimental setup.
2.Kill Switch(MinC)
This was Jarek Pankowski's idea.
Cloned and tested mainly by Kuba Piątkowski and Jarek Pankowski with a some help from other team members.
3.Bacto DHL
Constructs containing invasin and listeriolysin were cloned by Marta Błaszkiewicz and Joanna Leszczyńska under Michał Lower supervision.
The invasion experiments followed by flow cytometry measurements were performed by Kamil Koper, Anna Olchowik, Michał Lower and Cherry Moreno.
Microscopic observations were mainly conducted by Dominik Cysewski and Michał Lower.
Dominik's camera is also an important team member, without her we wouldn't have any pictures.
RFC that would help other teams measure cell invasion in the future was prepared by Anna Olchowik and Michał Lower.
4.Human Practices
Ania Puławska, Cherry Moreno, Dominik Cysewski, Joanna Leszcyńska, Marta Błaszkiewicz, and Milena Bażlekowa prepared the presentation, went to local high schools and gave lectures about synthetic biology and iGEM competition. Moreover they prepared a questionnaire for students.
The whole team did brainstorming about Biobrick ownership. Michał came up with the idea of licensing the Biobricks like computer programs using creative commons license. Later with help of Ania Olchowik it was shaped to form of RFC document.
5. Software
Was designed and implemented by Albert Bogdanowicz and Marta Błaszkiewicz under Michał's Lower supervision.
6. Wiki
Team's webpage draft has been coded by Anna Olchowik and Michał Lower, the final webpage has been recoded by a specialist in the field - Marta Błaszkiewicz.
It wouldn't look nice without Ania Puławska hand-made pictures. All members of the team contributed to our wiki.

Sc thesis which is linked to chromatin remodeling. Besides my scientific work, I like listening to metal music and reading books especially science-fiction novels.
Anna Saffray
I am a high school student who's hobby is going to the laboratory , and one beautiful day will become a scientist. I have also another hobbby - spending time with my horse and my dogs .
Radosław Stachowiak
My adventure with biology and biotechnology dates back to 1995 when I became a biotechnology student at University of Warsaw. In the year 2000 I completed my MSc thesis and I guess I couldn’t stop there so I immidiately started PhD studies. Now I’m done with studying and my job is to take care of students and introduce them into science. Still, I like being involved in crazy projects so characteristic of Sudents’ Societies. The more crazy and incredible project the better. I guess this is the case so here I am!
Justyna Lesiak
I am a PhD student at the Technischer Universität München, I just graduated in Biology at University of Warsaw. Now I am working on solventogenic Clostridia as a participant of the UE Clostridia Programme and trying to learn German (Hochdeutsch und Bairisch[!]), which seems to be not that difficult, as some people claim. In my spare time I like to listen to classical music, read books, do irish dancing and horseback riding.
Ania Puławska
I'm Anna I study biotechnology at Warsaw University, precisely in Department of Virology. I am sure that this is exactly where I should be:) Probably I'm the happiest student in Warsaw:D
Apart from my duties, I have many hobbies. I love traveling, drawing (check the home page graphic), snowboarding in winter or sailing in spring:) What more can I say? I'm an optimist^^
Kasia Grześ
I study biotechnology on Warsaw University (Institute of Bacterial Genetics). I'm on the last year of my studies and my work here is connected with Heat Shock Proteins, especially bacterial Hsp90 and it's interactions with other proteins. During my free time I spend a lot of time in the... kitchen, I simply love cooking. Maybe in some way it reminds working in the lab...;)
Dominik Cysewski
I come from Wroclaw, most charming city of Poland;-) I'm a graduate student at the University of Warsaw (Institute of Genetics and Biotechnology). Now I'm working on cross-linking of protein complexes and mapping them. Science is fascinating of course... But my hobby is mountaineering.

Ada Wong
As a year two student of the bachelor student of Biochemistry at CUHK, IGEM is a precious chance for me to learn more about synthetic biology and scientific research. I am just a year two student, therefore I can and need to learn more in this project, including the wet-lab technique and the synthetic biology theory. I am looking forward to meet other teams from all around the world to widen my horizons.

Cathy Mak
I am a bachelor student of biochemistry at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. It is a precious chance to participate in the iGEM competition in which I learnt a lot about the leading field of science – synthetic biology. I found it very interesting to study how simple organisms can be manipulated block by block and brick by brick. I was also deeply impressed by the infinite potential of synthetic biology for seemingly any biological systems to operate. In this competition, I am responsible for the wet lab and part registry. I acquired much useful hands on experience and technical know-how. It is of great value for my future studies and further enhancing my interests in science.

Chu Tinyi
I am a sophomore student majoring in biochemistry at CUHK. I have always been fascinated by the principles behind lives – even those of a single bacteria cell – so that I take a great delight in studying and exploring them. The beauty of iGEM is that it provides a platform for us as undergraduates to not only understand these principles but also carry out creation of new function by integrating them, and that’s also the reason why I choose to participate in it. I wish I could get a deeper comprehension about synthetic biology through iGEM, and hopefully apply the knowledge to mammalian cells for disease-related research in the future.

Jacky Loo
Hey, everyone, I'm Jacky. I'm glad to lead the team this year. As a final-year student studying Biochemistry, I'm inteserted in all lab working. In daily life, I like making new joke, writing new poem, singing with my guitar, enjoying all kind of sports.~ Most important, I like dreaming a lot. I always hope my dream come true. One of my dream is to engineer a bacteria...which can help me engineer other bacteria with the function that I am dreaming! HAHAHA!
Thanks a lot!

Ricky Thomson Choi
I am a bachelor student of Biochemistry at The Chinese University of Hong Kong. After learning some basic concepts of Biochemistry in the past 2 semesters, I am interested in the idea of synthetic biology and joined iGEM competition. As a member in wet lab team, it is so challenging that I can learn lots of laboratory techniques by doing wet lab works. Moreover, I take part in the designing of WIKI page of this project as I am also interested in computer skills. Being one of the members of CUHK team, I hope to draw the attention of the public on scientific researches in Hong Kong, and looking forward to have more students studying in biochemistry.

Wong Kit Ying
I’m a year 2 undergraduate student of biochemistry at CUHK. I’m interested in camping, cookery, reading and tarot. Long ago when I studied biology in high school, I’ve been very interested in creating functional synthetic systems in biology. To me, this is really a miracle to introduce a new system into an organism. I believe participating in iGEM2010 will surely seize my horizon in the field of biotechnology. And I find myself become more engaged in studying biochemistry as well as molecular biotechnology through the competition. MIT, here I go!!!

The idea of Artificial Cooperation System was proposed by undergrad team member.
Throughout our project, experiments were done by undergrads receiving some advice from grad students/instructor.
These experiments include series of experiments for data collection (e.g. assay, characterization).
We put the name of undergraduate student who did the experiment on most of the table/graph/chart.
Also, modelling of our system was done by one of our undergrad member, Shohei Kitano.Although we received some advice from instructor,
undergrad student made the blueprint, formulated the system, and analyzed on the computer.    Last but not least, we campaigned to raise funds for our travel.

Who we are
Advisors:
Assoc. Prof Ashley Buckle currently is running a lab in the Monash STRIP under the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology with research aimed at understanding how the structure and dynamics of proteins dictates their function. More information can be found at Buckle Lab
Dr. Andrew Perry is a Postdoctoral Fellow in the Whisstock lab, with research focusing on outer membrane pore forming proteins in mitochondria and bacteria. Structural biology and bioinformatics, protein structure by Nuclear Magnetic Resonance and X-ray crystallography.
Dr. Lloyd Low is a Postdoctoral researcher in Peter Boag's lab in the the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology Monash University. He is a former member of the Melbourne University iGEM team, and helped get us started at Monash.
Students:
Ben is currently a second year Bachelor of Science student, Majoring in Biochemistry and molecular biology with a minor in Microbiology.  Ben aspires to open up his own research and development company after graduating.
Will is a final year Bachelor of science student, with majors in 'Biochemistry' and 'Immnology and Human Pathology'. Will is currently seeking honours placement for 2011, and strives to earn a PhD scholarship.
Anna is in her final year studying a Bachelor of Science with majors in Biochemistry and Physiology. She intends to further her studies by continuing with honours and pursuing a PhD.
Daniel is a first year bachelor of Biomedical science student and on completion of his degree will be a biochemistry or molecuar biology major. Daniel will further his studies with a honours and eventually a PhD, and wishes to travel the world working for various laboratories as a Post doctoral research fellow.
Ricky is a third year Bachelor of Science student majoring in Biochemistry and Molecular biology, and as of the beginning of 2010, also a first year engineering student looking at majoring in Chemical engineering. Upon graduation, with his knowledge of Biochemistry and Molecular biology and specialisation in Chemical engineering he wishes to find a niche between the two disciplines; participating in the igem competition is a great stepping stone.
What we did
For team Monash Australia we are currently balancing iGEM work with semester one and two of university, with the Jamboree around out end of year examinations. Due to this we have equally divided all work between us to help us juggle university study and iGEM project. Much of the iGEM project would have not been possible if it was not for the drive, energy and passion that both Ben and Andrew have given, Thanks guys.

Introduction
In synthetic biology when creating the minimal cell  XXX factors have been identified as essential for normal function of RNAP, both regarding normal elongation but also in terms of normal termination function. (REFFF) of these XXX have been identified to take part in regulatory function. While the rest is core subunits. Of interest for regulation in terms of termination Anti-termination will be highlighted:
NusA:
NusG:
NusE:
NusB:
Due to the construction of the RNAP of many subcomponents and systems, the function of the RNAP can be regulated by only adding or changing one or a few factors. This is the mechanism in the different termination and anti-termination functions described below.

Anastasiya S. Haugaard
Scientific Background
Molecular Biology and Chemistry
About me
I am Ukrainian and I have been living in Denmark for about 8 years. I have finished international high school IB (International Baccalaureate) at Nørre Gymnasium. Then I went to study at Roskilde University, where I received a Bachelor degree in Molecular Biology and Chemistry. Currently I am taking Masters in Biotechnology at DTU. I am mostly interested in Biomedical Microbiology and that is why I follow this study line. In my spare time I enjoy travelling, reading good books and spending time with my friends and family, especially by making “movies and dinner” times, etc. I am also going to a gym and doing other sports on regular basis.
Anja Sander
Scientific Background
Molecular Biomedicine
About me
I am original from Germany, but now I lived in Denmark for about 14 years and I like it ;-) I started to study Medicine at Aarhus University, just to find out that I, instead of treating patients, like more to do research on the causes of a given disease. That is why I have taken a bachelors degree in Molecular Biomedicine at Copenhagen University and now continue with my master studies at DTU. Bacteria are my love and therefore I want to specialize in Biomedical Microbiology. Besides bacteria, my academic focus is on immunology, medicine, antibiotic resistance and infection mechanisms, but also what it means to conduct good science and experimental set-ups incl. scientific writing. I am going to write my master thesis at the University of Massachusetts Medical School in the USA and I am really looking forward to this! In my spare time I enjoy spending my time with my husband, family and friends. I love indoor climbing, some day I will try outdoor climbing of course (until then practice, practice...), but it is a fascinating sport, believe me ;-) One of my dreams is to travel around the world, but at the moment the duration of time must be shorter than 80 days ;-)
Annemi Ingebrekt Jollmann

The University of Alberta iGEM Team from Edmonton has worked hard this summer to bring our kit to life for high school students.  Our diverse backgrounds, skills, talents and personalities have allowed us to work cooperatively and successfully. Click the names on the left panel to learn more about our members, advisors, and support staff.  Special thanks to our support staff and sponsors for aiding our project!
Karina Arnesen
Honors in Biochemistry (4th Year); Sub-project: Plasmid Construction
This is my first year with the Alberta iGEM team, and so far so good!  I plan to continue into further studies after my degree.  Otherwise, I enjoy martial arts, playing piano and reading modern fiction.
Eric Bennett
Electrical Engineering, Biomedical Option (Graduate); Sub-project: Modelling & Bead Assembly
This is my second year involved with iGEM. I expect this year to be as enjoyable as the last and even more successful. My participation in iGEM has exposed me to concepts and experiences that I could not have received elsewhere in my undergrad experience. My interests include brain machine interfacing, computational intelligence, haptic teleoperation, and of course, synthetic biology. I am now pursuing my Masters in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Florida. iGEM has proven to be a fascinating and rewarding experience and I am looking forward to the competition.
Stephanie Cornfort
Specialized in Marketing Bachelor of Commerce Program (3rd Year); Sub-project: Distribution & Market Analysis
I am in my third year of university, attending the Alberta School of Business and majoring in marketing.  I am involved in a number of students groups including iGEM, EDGE Business Competition, and Campus Recreation. In my spare time I coach figure skating in the Edmonton community.
Oscar Cortes
Specialized in Molecular Genetics (Graduate); Sub-project: Bead Assembly
My future plans include entering into a Masters program in Medical Genetics or Human Genetics, and pursuing this discipline towards a PhD. I enjoy reading books about the human genome and advancements in stem cell research. In my spare time I like to play a variety of sports that I am not necessarily good at: soccer, softball, and dodge ball. I see iGEM as an extraordinary opportunity for me to be exposed to real life research, in which my knowledge of molecular genetics will be challenged, and will help me further my understanding of Synthetic Biology. ""Man with all his noble qualities still bears in his bodily frame the indelible stamp of his lowly origin"" - Charles Darwin
Anh Dao
Biological Sciences & Chemistry (5th Year); Sub-project: BioByte Construction & Bead Assembly
Since I enjoy learning new things, the General Science program allows me to explore a broad range of subjects, from Biochemistry and Microbiology to Classics and Nutritional Food Sciences. My goal is to get into graduate studies in either Microbiology and Biotechnology or Microbiology and Genetics. Thus, I believe iGEM is a fascinating opportunity to learn about Synthetic Biology, to gain experience conducting experiments in a laboratory and work with various people with different educational backgrounds. When I am not slaving away with studying and schoolwork, my hobbies include: producing digital art on Photoshop, listening to music, playing the piano and chasing my ankle-biting dog when he slips past the backyard fence because he plans to wreak havoc around the neighborhood.
Mark Elliott
Biology with Business Minor (3rd Year); Sub-project: Bead Assembly and Fundraising
I am looking forward to the upcoming year. It’s my first year involved with iGEM and I am excited about the project that we are working on. The team is awesome and I couldn’t have asked for a better group. I am interested in the commercial applications of synthetic biology as I think it has a huge potential in the biofuels market. I am amazed at what can be done in the field already and am excited to see how it evolves and flourishes. I hope to be involved in business in some manner in my future and I think it would be an incredible experience to own a biotech or green energy company.
Kim Freeman
Biological Sciences (4th Year); Sub-project: Reusable Plates
I am about to graduate from my undergrad degree in biology and plan on pursuing a postgrad degree in a much, much warmer climate. Other than science, my favorite things include cooking, music, running and flying.  I joined iGEM because of the sheer potential synthetic biology offers and to gain a little insight into what is already a hugely controversial field. After an inspiring introduction, I am quite excited to see where we'll be in 10 years!
Paige Hacking
Biological Sciences (3rd Year); Sub-project: Reusable Plates, Fundraising, and Team Management
I am currently a third year student en route to completing a BSc degree. Although I’m not set on a particular career just yet, I am interested in optometry and medicine. When I’m not studying, I’m busy volunteering, singing with my choir, teaching dance or indulging in random vegetarian cuisine. I believe iGEM offers undergraduates a unique opportunity to collaborate with individuals from not only science, but many other fields of study. As a first time team member, I am excited to take what I’ve learned in lecture and apply it to a project with huge business and educational potential. I look forward to a fun summer and an intense competition!
Pieter Hak
Biological Sciences with Chemistry Minor (4th Year); Sub-project: Multiple Project Contributor
I’m already done my bachelors at the UofA, I’ve just been tagging along with iGEM over the summer as a volunteer. From iGEM I’m looking toward studies and work related to synthetic biology.  I really hope to see synthetic biology open up the intricate machine-like world inside cells to engineering applications.  For now, help from the biofuels industry seems to be a safe bet, as long as oil prices stay high.  I’m also a fan of rally racing, DnB, military aviation, eastern and western philosophy/metaphysics and you can find me on Starcraft 2 occasionally.
Arni Hansen
Specialized in Molecular Genetics (Graduate); Sub-project: Multiple Project Contributor
I was born in Toronto, Ontario but have spent nearly my entire life in Edmonton. I aim to contribute my knowledge and abilities in this field to the U of A iGEM team. I look forward to being a part of a team that offers its students a chance to participate in the scientific community and to contribute to the burgeoning field of synthetic biology. My outside interests are: sport (soccer, rock climbing), music (playing kit drums, listening to nearly all genres), and languages (fluent in one, nearly-functional in three more, and can say at least “thank you” in about 30 others). I sincerely hope to help ensure that the U of A team continues to prove itself as an organization in the vanguard of scientific innovation. I also love to laugh…ha ha.
Stephen Jahns
Computing Science / Genetics (4th Year); Sub-project: Software
Steve is pretty much the coolest guy I know. He grew up out in the bushes, and had to knife-fight a fully grown grizzly every day before school. Now, he's made it his mission to clean up the streets, and will stop at nothing before Eric Bennett and his gang of hooligans are brought to justice.
David Kramer
Honors in Biochemistry (4th Year); Sub-project: Competent Cells
This is my first year being involved with the iGEM team.  As Biochemistry is one of my major, it serves as my primary interest to study the inner workings of life and I find synthetic biology and it's ability to play with these processes extremely interesting.  In my spare time I can be found reading up on current scientific advances, gaming, or drinking ridiculous amounts of coffee.  I hope to either pursue Synthetic Biology through a PhD or study Medicine in the future.  So far, iGEM has been an excellent opportunity to learn about the potential that biological systems hold for future industrial applications.  I look forward to seeing everyone in Boston!
Jacqueline Lee
Honors in Bioinformatics (3rd Year); Sub-project: Software
This is my first year in iGEM. I joined iGEM because of the opportunities it presented in learning about research, synthetic biology and the applications of computing science to these fields.  I am interested in mathematical modeling, genetics and molecular biology and I would like to pursue these interests by obtaining my doctorate and doing research into mathematical modeling of biological systems.  I am originally from Red Deer, Alberta and in my free time, I enjoy traveling around the Canadian Rockies doing activities such as backpacking, canoeing and biking.  I look forward to solving problems and working with and meeting new people through the course of this project.
Kurtis Letwin
Bachelor of Commerce Specialized in Accounting (3rd Year); Sub-project: Distribution & Market Analysis
I am a third year Accounting major at the Alberta School of Business, with a minor in Strategic Management and Organization. I am originally from a small town northeast of Edmonton where it takes only five minutes to drive through the whole community! Currently, I am an External Director for the EDGE Business Competition and a Teacher's Assistant with the Management Science Department at the School of Business. As well, I am a Student Ambassador for the Alberta School of Business and represent the school at various social and recruiting events. I have attended a number of conferences and competitions on behalf of the business faculty, most notably the 2010 Deloitte National Leadership Conference. I am a complete sports fanatic and when I can find some spare time I enjoy officiating minor hockey games. I love meeting new people and iGEM is definitely a place where I will get to do just that.
Darren Liviniuk
Bachelor of Commerce Specialized in Accounting (4th Year); Sub-project: Distribution & Market Analysis
I am in my final year at the Alberta School of Business and an active representative of the University of Alberta, as President of the Accounting Club, as Captain of the JDC West Taxation Team, as a Student Ambassador, and as the Business Blogger. I attended the Deloitte National Leadership Conference in 2009 and will join the firm’s Edmonton office in 2011. Finally, in my spare time, I am an avid reader, a dismal golfer, and play soccer and basketball.
David Lloyd
Honors in Biochemistry (5th Year); Sub-project: Fundraising, Business Development & Team Management
This is my second year being involved in iGEM. While Biochemistry is my major, I have many interests including Genetics, Immunology, Cell Biology, Bioinformatics, and Microbiology. In my spare time I can be found playing sports like soccer, volleyball, or squash, as well as playing piano, listening to music, and playing video games. In the future, I hope to continue into a graduate program in Biochemistry, Cell Biology, or Synthetic Biology. iGEM has been an amazing opportunity to gain additional skills in a variety of fields and I greatly look forward to another year in the competition!
Amanda Pisio
Honors in Molecular Genetics (Graduate); Sub-project: Plasmid & BioByte Construction
I was born and raised in the city of Edmonton. I plan on continuing on to do my masters at the University of Alberta this following year. I hope to spend my career doing research in the field of immunology or developmental biology. During my free time I rock climb, dance, play Ultimate Frisbee. In the summers I love to camp, hike and spend time at lakes. I also take as many opportunities as I can to travel. This coming fall I will be backpacking around Europe. I joined iGEM because I believe that it will be an interesting experience in a field that I have little experience in and I hope to spend the summer tackling all the difficult problems that come our way.
Alina Ponomarev
Honors in Immunology and Infection (3rd Year); Sub-project: BioByte Construction & Bead Assembly
This is my second year with iGEM. Last year was an incredible learning experience and I am very excited for this upcoming year. In the future, I hope to pursue a Medical Degree or a PhD in Immunology and Infection. I moved here from Russia ten years ago. In my spare time I like to jog, dance and drive.
Fahad Safi
Biological Science and Chemistry (4th Year); Sub-project: Multiple Project Contributor
I am entering my fourth year in my undergrad degree in Biological sciences and chemistry at the University of Alberta. I love my degree because it allows me to gain experience in a wide variety of subjects. I enjoy research because it allows me to apply my knowledge, challenge myself and think critically. Working with iGEM is an opportunity in a life time and I am very glad to be a part of this very exciting group that is sure to help make many breakthroughs in modern synthetic biology and genetics. In my spare time I like to go to the gym, tan and then do my laundry. I also enjoy boxing and call of duty.
Ravina Singh
Biology (3rd Year); Sub-project: Reusable Plates
I am currently a third year BSc student with a major in biological sciences and minor in psychology.  I still have no idea what I want to do after my degree; hopefully I have figured it out by the time I graduate. This was my first year on the iGEM team and I have to say that synthetic biology has definitely sparked an interest in me.   In my spare time I like to read, play video games and catch up with my favourite TV shows.
John Taggart
Economics with Biological Sciences Minor (4th Year); Sub-project: Fundraising & Human Practices
I am most passionate about botany and as such am fond of all things plants. This is my first year with the iGEM team and I am very excited because I see synthetic biology as a vehicle to help relieve many of the challenges facing humanity. To solve problems using game theory (an economic tool) we must work our way backwards to the beginning. All life begins with a genetic code.
Jeremy Thomas
Pharmacology (4th Year); Sub-project: BioByte Design & Construction
After I finish my degree, I plan to continue into medical research. I’ve always been interested in how things work- my primary interests are in Physiology and Pharmacology. I’m motivated by challenges, and I’m glad to be joining the university's iGEM team this year. I find Synthetic Biology to be incredibly fascinating. I have high hopes for the field and our part of it this year. Though I was born and raised in and around Toronto, I came to Edmonton to get another perspective on the great big country that I live in. I’ve also always wanted to see the Northern Lights. I’ve learned many things in my time here, and I’ve truly grown to hate the cold. In my free time, I enjoy running, playing the piano, and flossing (dental hygiene is important!).
Mike Wilson
Biology with Computer Sciences Minor (4th Year); Sub-project: Software
My interests are diverse (evolution, music, visual arts, robotics, artificial intelligence, and more) but at the root of them all is my interest in creativity. I am constantly in awe of the creative power of evolution and the astounding diversity of the life on our little planet.  What better way to learn more about the the inner workings of the living things around us than to tinker with them and reassemble their parts in new and strange (hopefully useful) ways? I very excited to be a part of the iGEM team and participate in the development of new tools and methods in the field of Synthetic Biology.  I hope to continue researching in this area beyond my undergrad, and ultimately use these tools for the creation of microbial robots.
Zach Wiltshire
Specialized in Cell Biology (4th Year); Sub-project: Reusable Plates, Fundraising & Team Management
I am entering into my last year in the Cell Biology program at the University of Alberta and, this will be my third year involved with iGEM. In addition to iGEM, my other research experiences have included synbio and biophysics projects. iGEM has proven to be an amazing eye opener for the potential of biological engineering. I hope to continue to be involved with some aspect of this field in the future.
Gaby Wong
Visual Communications (4th Year); Sub-project: Kit, Poster, & Identity Design
I am finishing my last year in the BDes program, majoring in Visual Communications. My addiction involves following design & art blogs and reading design books. I spend my free time repurposing furniture, doodling, decorating cupcakes and listening to music. iGEM has given me a great opportunity to apply my design knowledge to something real and practical.

Beginning
iGEM team UPO-Sevilla is one of the smallest team of the 2010 iGEM contest. This is the first time we take part in iGEM and also in Synthetic Biology, so our goal this year is to learn all we can about SB and tools it uses. This is the reason why some 2nd course biotechnology students started looking for support in Universidad Pablo de Olavide, in Sevilla (Spain), at the beginning of their course. Luckily we soon found help from Fernando Govantes (Genetic Microbiology) and Luis Merino (Computer Engineering), two of our teachers. With them, we started to think we could take part in this international contest. Next, a student of computer engineering, Eduardo Pavón, completed the team.
In a short time, we started to meet for brainstorming. We got excited about making a project which came from our imagination. And not few times Fernando had to tell us that our ideas were biologically impossible. Little by little we narrowed the possibilities down to only two ideas: “remote control bacteria” and “targeting bacteria to a non-diffusible target exposed on a surface”. Finally we chose the last one; this idea would take the name of ""Bacterial Crowding"".
The other jigsaw we had to solve was: “Where were we going to get financing for the project?” In regard to that, we were lucky to meet Rosario Jiménez, OTRI (Oficina de Transferencia de Resultados de Investigación) director. She paid our inscription and also helped us to find sponsors for the remainder of our budget. We have to thank her for her help.

Members & Contact
Instructors:
Fernando Govantes Romero. Wet lab leader (fgovrom@upo.es) “Blues man”
Fernando is a Genetic Microbiologist who works in CABD (Centro Andaluz de Biología del Desarrollo). His research deals with molecular mechanism of gene regulation and the study of bacterial biofilm development. Thanks to Fernando, the team had access to a lab where we would develop the project. The students were undergrads, so they could not have access to the lab without his presence. This means that he has been in the lab five days a week, over ten hours a day. iGEM team UPO-Sevilla would not have been possible without him. Thanks Fernan!
Luis Merino Cabañas. Dry lab leader (lmercab@upo.es) ""The Simulator""
Luis is Assistant Professor at the UPO's School of Engineering. He works in Systems Engineering and Automation, mainly in Robotics. Although his work has few similar things with the science of life, he seemed interested in Synthetic Biology when he knew about it. Soon he had learnt much about the biological part of the project. The nexus between dry and wet lab was thinner because of him. Due to the fact that our DryLab is composed only by two people (Edu and Luis), they are doing a hard work to bring to fruition the modeling issue.
Undergrads:
2nd year students of Biotechnology:
Adrian Arellano Davín (adri.correo@hotmail.com) ""The hairy""
I really love science especially if it’s related to molecular biology or physics. I’m quite cheerful and enthusiastic and I’m always thinking about new things to do. I also love cinema, rollerblading and playing Go (but I’m not a good player at all). When I finish the degree in biotechnology I'd like to carry on my scientific career in Japan or USA. I think that the iGEM contest gives to all us a fantastic chance of learning a lot about this new science which is called Synthetic Biology.
David Caballero Pradas (davidcp-24@hotmail.com) ""The perfectionist""
Hello! I am one of those guys who cannot stop. I am always doing something and boredom is not a possibility. I like almost all types of music, but I prefer rock and blues. Also I do like to play my electric guitar or the harm. I practice sport as often as I can; principally I go to the gym, running or rollerblading. But I do not enjoy watching sports on the TV.
Biotechnology attracted me two years ago, when I had to choose my degree, due to the wide opportunities it offers. I like a lot of different investigation fields like gene regulation or nanoparticles design; most of them in the micro or nano scale. I think Synthetic Biology will help to enlarge the biological knowledge from its standard and modeling point of view.
Eva Fernández Cáceres (evitatrespuntos_27@hotmail.com) ""The hippie""
Eva would like to have lived the summer of love, been born in San Francisco and worn flowers in her hair, but she was born in Seville and she chose science as her way of life. She is a practical girl. If she hadn′t been a girl, she would have been a lovely, big-eyed cat with long whiskers.  She likes small things, that′s why she loves studying Biotechnology. She also loves drawing colorful pictures wearing her white scientific coat, because she has an artist′s soul.
Paola Gallardo Palomo (handstock@hotmail.com) ""Efficiency woman""
Short and bad-tempered. She is keen on “torture” everyone (mice, E. coli, boyfriend, etc.) and fiddle about in the lab. She doesn't respect literary people (they are not science people!), despite the fact that she likes reading philosophy books. When she lay off animals, she listens to British music, most of them unknown, and watching films, self-denominated independent, or action films which main character is a woman. She is a fussbudget of the order, in other words, she likes that everything keeps the order that she decides, otherwise it is recommended to keep at a reasonable distance.
Félix Reyes Martín (felixreyes90@gmail.com) ""Sleepyman""
The description of Félix written by himself should appear here. Félix is a great guy, but very lazy (so lazy that his description is not written yet). He is very friendly and polite and he never gets angry (except once somebody kidded about him because he had not beard, and he has not got any beard yet). He loves science and maths specially difficult problems. Actually Félix loves difficult things, ""because they are not easy"". If you meet him, you will probably think that he is an hybrid between Leonard Hofstadter (but more clever) and Edward Cullen (but he doesn't drinks blood, or at least we think so). To sum up, he is a really good guy.
3rd year student of Computer Engineering:
Luis Eduardo Pavón (lepavgom@gmail.com) ""The geek""
First of all, It's hard to describe me in a few paragraphs.
I like classic rock, although I'm not a music lover. As for sports, I like basketball, but, as I always say: ""Running is for the coward"". I love reading, among my favourite writers are Terry Pratchett, Asimov, Lovecraft, Tolkien, George R. R. Martin, Saramago...and I'm surely forgetting a few writers more. As any geek worth his salt, I'm also a videogames enthusiast and I enjoy experimenting on light-equipped or wired stuff. I usually meet my friends for a couple of beers (I love beer myself) and we also play roleplaying games every once in a while.
Finally, I'm the group's programmer. I'm in charge of the Wiki page and the Bacterial Crowding simulation, together with Luis Merino. This is my first contact with Biotechnology but still, I'm delighted with the experience so far.
Division of labor
The whole work have been done by the team members.
Wet Lab
Fernando Govantes has managed the project, from the beginning to the end. Our instructor have taught us the basic rules and protocols which are carried out in a lab and have reviewed the experiments we were doing. He did a quite strong effort continuing the work even in weekends. Without his help we could not have participated in the iGEM contest.
The students have been extracting parts from E.Coli genome, building the circuits and devices and measuring chemotaxis behaviour with different assays. Moreover, they have looked for funding financing for the project and the trip, and written huge amounts of information in the wiki. They recognize that the work have been much harder than expected(and much funnier). For more informatioin about the division of labour see in Notebook .
Dry Lab
Our dry lab instructor, Luis Merino,  gave us some classes about engineering and informatics issues that  were related to Synthetic Biology. Using Simbiology he has developed a model which describes the expected behaviour of the system we have designed. He also has debugged  some problems of the simulation. Despite of coming from the robotic field he has showed a big interest in this new area of science.
Edu (the choosen one, or the alone-informatics student) has borne all the weight of doing the whole design of the wiki. Moreover, he has programmed in JAVA a simulation which represents the behaviour of the system we developed.

University of British Columbia
The University of British Columbia, established in 1908, educates a student population of 50,000 on major campuses in two cities and holds an international reputation for excellence in advanced research and learning.  The largest campus is 30 minutes from the heart of downtown Vancouver, a spectacular campus that is a 'must-see' for any visitor to the city -- where snow-capped mountains meet ocean, and breathtaking vistas greet you around every corner.  The Vancouver campus boasts some of the city's best attractions and recreation facilities, including the Museum of Anthropology, the Chan Centre for the Performing Arts, the UBC Botanical Garden and Centre for Plant Research, and endless opportunities to explore forested trails in the adjoining 763-hectare Pacific Spirit Regional Park.
Michael Smith Laboratories
In 1987, the University of British Columbia made a bold investment in the future by establishing Canada's first interdisciplinary biotechnology unit. Under the visionary leadership of Dr. Michael Smith, the UBC Biotechnology Laboratory was created and a gifted team of young scientists were recruited.  In 2004, the Biotechnology Laboratory was renamed the Michael Smith Laboratories in honour of the founding Director.
There are approximately 250 research personnel in the Laboratory, with research activities falling into four major areas of emphasis: molecular genetics, fermentation and bio-process engineering, plant and forestry molecular genetics, bioinformatics. There is a strong emphasis on interdisciplinary interaction and overlap of interest among the different groups. Awards from prestigious national and international organizations are continually recognizing the faculty members for their excellence.
Vancouver, Canada
Vancouver, one of the world's most spectacular cities, welcomed the world as host city of the 2010 Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games.
The city of Vancouver is renowned for its incomparable natural beauty and cultural diversity.  For thousands of years the Coast Salish people have called the area now known as Vancouver home. Their history and cultural traditions, upholding a deep respect for nature and humanity, are tightly woven into the city's cultural fabric.
Today, Vancouver's cosmopolitan appeal can be attributed to its international population of citizens; there are Aboriginal populations as well as British descendants, Chinese, Japanese, German, Indo-Pakistani, French, Italian, Dutch, Scandinavian, Ukrainian, Filipino and Greek, among other diverse nationalities. As a world-class city, Vancouver continues to draw the world's great nations together in a celebration of human spirit and achievement.

Undergraduates
Alex Grigg
I’m going into my second year of biomedical sciences. It’s my first year  of iGEM, and this year I’ll be helping with designing circuits for our  project and creating it in the wet-lab. Also, I’ll be heading up our  community outreach by contacting media outlets and organizing events to  help promote iGEM awareness. My hobbies include hockey, mixed martial  arts, and eating gluten-free food. I also enjoy going to alternative rock  and dubstep shows.
Chris Tang
I just completed my second year in the Biological Sciences at the University of  Calgary. I am planning to specialize in the field of Cellular and Molecular  Microbiology, which deals primarily with investigation of bacteria. This year, I  will be helping to promote iGEM with the Marketing and Finance team as well as  assisting with the wetlab components. I joined the iGEM team because of the new  and exciting field as well as the opportunity to work hands-on with a group of  people.  Synthetic biology is a very new field with massive amounts of potential  and I am excited to be a part of this team. I love sports and am a huge Calgary  Flames and New England Patriots fan. In my spare time, I like to play sports,  play video games, read, and help out at my church.
Dev Vyas
I have just completed my first year in Biomedical Sciences working towards  my degree in the Bachelor of Health Sciences in the Faculty of Medicine. I  have a strong interest in the field of synthetic Biology and therefore am  very excited to be a part of the 2010 University of Calgary iGEM team. As  this will be my first research opportunity at the university level, the  only experience I have is that obtained from first year Biology labs and  Medical Science courses. I believe that one of the major characteristics  of iGEM, interdisciplinary cooperation, allows the team to bring together top student  talents from faculties ranging from engineering to medicine. I am also a  huge soccer fan, especially Manchester United and Leicester City!
Emily Hicks
I’ve just finished my second year as a Biomedical Science student in the  Bachelor of Health Sciences program. I have taken Medical Science and  biology courses as well as ethics and Health in Society. I joined the iGEM  team because I’m really excited to have the opportunity to work on  something that’s novel and part of a very diverse team. I think synthetic  biology is an interesting and powerful field that will only grow in the  near future and it’s exciting to be a part of something that may be able  to come up with solutions to global problems. This summer, I’m going to be  working on the outreach team as well as in the lab and the iGEM wiki. I  will be helping to present our project to high school students to try to  build more interest in synthetic biology in Alberta. In my spare time I  compete in highland dancing, play the oboe in the University of Calgary  Symphonic band and participate in plays with Storybook theatre.
Himika Dastidar
My name is Himika Dastidar and I am a Biomedical Sciences student in the University of Calgary. I am going into my 3rd year in the fall of 2010.  As a student of Biomedical Sciences, I have a background in cell biology, basic biochemistry and basic genetics. I am involved in iGEM because I think that iGEM will give me interdisciplinary exposure to molecular biology. The additional challenge of engineering circuits in molecular biology is rather new and interesting. iGEM also allows me to gain hands on experience about concepts learnt in class such as PCR, restriction digest etc. Other than academic involvement, I am involved in extracurricular activities such as volunteering with Big Brothers Big Sisters Calgary and LinkAges. I am also involved in activities like singing, playing the guitar, and martial arts. I think this summer is going to be a fantastic learning experience. I look forward to presenting University of Calgary’s team project at MIT and meeting other teams that share similar interest in synthetic biology.
Jeremy Choo
I am a second year biological science student at the University of Calgary. My main interests include microbial biology so I intend to specialize in Cellular, Microbial, and Molecular Biology. I am extremely interested in constructing genes using the BioBrick method. Wet labs will definitely be one of the highlights of the project. My contributions to the iGEM team including working primarily on the translation transcription circuit and working with periplasmic RFP. Outside the wet lab my roles include t-shirt designs and working on the team wiki. When not doing academic related work I am either playing squash, running, attending martial arts, volunteering, tutoring or watching movies.
Raida Khwaja
I’m a first year student in Biomedical Science in the Bachelors of Health Sciences Program at the University of Calgary. My interest in research emerged from my participation in Sanofi Aventis Bio Talent Challenge in 2008 through a self-initiated research project involving the behaviour of pharyngeal pumping of C.elegans upon various exposures. iGEM has given me another opportunity to increase my knowledge on the various aspects of research, with an exclusive focus on Molecular Biology and hands-on experience with technologies like PCR, gel electrophoresis and chromatography. This year, I will be working in the Wet Lab to construct the circuit of our toolkit which will detect Periplasmic Protein Misfolding in E.coli bacteria, as well as the Ethics of Synthetic Biology. Apart from iGEM, I volunteer and also tutor high school students. In my spare time, I like to write poetry and enjoy the scenic beauty of Calgary.
Patrick Wu
I am currently entering my second year of Bioinformatics in the Bachelor of Health Sciences Program at the University of Calgary. I was interested in becoming a part of iGEM because of its interdisciplinary approach to biology and engineering. This year, I will be contributing to the construction of the team wiki, as well as contributing to the modelling and animation projects. I believe iGEM will be an exciting and unique experience, since this gives undergraduate students first-hand experience in wet-lab and dry-lab work that they design and direct themselves. I'm a bit of a gamer at heart, though I do some writing on the side. I also like karate, drawing, and sleeping. Especially sleeping.
Advisors
Dave Curran
Hey, I'm Dave, and one of the two grad advisors for Calgary this year. I'm currently doing a Master's in infectious diseases, and I wanted to be a part of iGEM because I was on the Calgary team for 2 years during my undergrad. I get to play teacher/troubleshooter/advisor/etc. for the team, so here's hoping I know what I'm talking about. I had to come back to the team now, as iGEM has always been a great experience and a good place to see some really cool ideas, as well as those very cool idea with no real-world practicality to speak of (if anyone remembers the 2007 Calgary project, EcoLisa, I'm proud to say I was part of that Rube Goldberg of an idea). Anyways, I do a lot of computer stuff, at home and at work, and dabble in a little squash when time allows. Cheers!

Hey everyone, I'm Paul Adamiak. I'm in my first year of a Masters program in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology at the University of Calgary. I handled the wiki part of our team three years ago when I was in my undergraduate degree. I came back this year to take on a modeling project and to help with the logistics of running the team.

iGEM - INTERNATIONAL GENETICALLY ENGINEERED MACHINES
The International Genetically Engineered Machines (iGEM) competition is annually held at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in the field of Synthetic Biology. Since 2004, this competition encourages undergraduate teams from all over the world to develop a project that intertwines the principles of Biology and Engineering. The competition not only determines the worth of projects solely based on biological merit, but also requires teams to examine their project as a whole. This includes aspects such as modelling of genetic circuits, marketing the project and educating the public about iGEM and Synthetic Biology.  For more information about iGEM, please visit their official website .
The U of C iGEM team is made up of 15 undergraduate students from Health Sciences, Engineering, Computer Science and Kinesiology as well as 4 facilitators.  For more information regarding the U of C iGEM Enterprise, please visit our website .

A TOUR OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CALGARY iGEM TEAM
Welcome to the University of Calgary iGEM wiki! This is the first step of our tour! With this tour, you will not only learn about our overall project, but also delve into all aspects of our project and find out what we've been up to lately. On this page, you can read about iGEM, our project, and check out a few pictures that display our adventures in synthetic biology. Also, please feel free to leave any comments or suggestions at the bottom of the page. Once you've finished exploring our front page, please click HERE to continue the tour for an intro of our team!
U OF C iGEM: REPROGRAMMING A LANGUAGE AND A COMMUNITY
The progression of strong scientific research depends on whether industry and the public know about it and understand how the research can be applied. With this in mind, the U of C iGEM team’s work stretches far beyond the wetlab. We pursued initiatives all the way from mathematical modelling to ethics and from education to fundraising. Below there is a list of all the aspects of our project with respective icons and a brief description about each endeavour. These icons are present throughout our wiki so you can keep track of which aspect of our project you are learning about.
LAB. For the wetlab, we explored the concept of Quorum Sensing, a cell-to-cell communication process used by bacteria. We constructed the V. harveyi AI-2 signalling system in E. coli. This system allows for the fined tuned coordination of bacterial behaviour in that bacterial colonies are able to act as single entities.
MODELLING. We modelled the AI-2 signalling system using mathematical modelling (Matlab) and the novel Membrane Computing (Mathematica) frameworks. The purpose of these models is to characterize the AI-2 signalling system by predicting and evaluating certain parameters.
HUMAN PRACTICES. We pursued various approaches to communicate with the public about Synthetic Biology, iGEM and iGEM at the UofC. This initiative is important to gain an understanding of the public perception of Synthetic Biology, whether the public knows about this field or not. We investigated the ethical issues surrounding this emerging field as well as novel means to communicate our research work with the public.
SECOND LIFE. Education is a fundamental aspect of iGEM because synthetic biology is an emerging field in which students have limited knowledge before participating. We have created and are continually developing an educational tool for teaching synthetic biology within the virtual world of Second Life. This interactive platform has been used to teach the potential applications of synthetic biology, the assembly of genetic circuits, and molecular biology lab procedures. We hope that our virtual learning environment will allow for the training of future iGEMers.
MARKETING. In order to (1) get industry interested in Synthetic Biology/iGEM, (2) afford to send all UofC team members to the iGEM Jamboree and (3) fund lab, modelling, Second Life and outreach endeavours, we have pursued marketing and fundraising initiatives. Our communication with businesses in many industrial sectors allows for the discussion of the opportunities and future developments of synthetic biology and the potential applications of our wetlab and modelling projects. Our marketing endeavour is intertwined with the outreach initiative and can thus be found under the 'Human Practices' section.
Another important aspect of communication in this competition is the availability of collaborative work, within our own team and as a community itself. Our team is made up of students from health sciences, kinesiology, and engineering;  who are actively participating in interdisciplinary work. This requires the ability to communicate information to people from different backgrounds and perspectives. As well, iGEM allows us to communicate with other teams at an international scale. We hope to establish means of communication and thus cooperation with other teams in our respective projects, enhancing the iGEM experience.
The wetlab, modelling, second life, human practices, and fundraising components of our project have allowed us to establish communication at the cell, individual, and synthetic bio community levels.
LATEST NEWS

Faculty Instructors
Kristian M. Müller guided us during the whole time with his great expertise and knowledge. He was never to busy to have a talk with us.
Katja M. Arndt was with us during the start-up phase but then had to leave us during the project, because she followed a call to a professorship in Potsdam.
We were allowed to use their lab and all the equipment we needed. In the lab no one ever worked with AAV-2.
Ph.D candidate Instructors
Sven Hagen & Tobias Baumann taught us how to work in a lab and helped  us to get practice in many methods , e. g. they provided special iGEM training sessions for cloning and how to run a cell culture. Later on the students who already knew how to work shared their knowledge with the other team members, so that they could work in their own, too. Sven and Tobias always offered their help if we were in trouble with the daily lab work.
Post Doc Advisor
Our advisor Amor Hajri had some experience with lentiviruses. He gave us an introduction on handling viral systems in general. He also never worked with AAV-2 before.
The diploma student Björn Albrecht from the technical faculty helped us with the AFM imaging.
The technician Barbara Sauer from Katja’s lab taught us how to use the Beckman Coulter Counter for flow cytometry analysis and how to evaluate the results.
Faculty member Jochen Golecki showed us how to take pictures with the EM.
From day one, the team Freiburg_Bioware 2010 met weekly to make agreements, coordinate future work in the lab, and to talk about methods and the development of the project.

The iGEM 2010 Team Freiburg
We are a team of students consisting of 15 members. Among, there are 13 biology students specialized in various topics such as Biochemistry, Genetics, Microbiology, Plant Biotechnology, Immunology and of course Synthetic Biology. Furthermore, our team has one student of physics and one student of informatics. Combining these abilities we handled the challenges associated with our project and realized it hand in hand. Over the past summer, the team of biology students worked in groups and was greatly supported by our instructors and supervisor. Each group consisted of 2-3 students and was specialized either on DNA cloning or on cell culture. These main topics were again divided into smaller ones, like for example ‘N-terminal fusion’ or ‘loop modifications’ of our virus. As our labjournal editings reached unlimited dimensions, we realized that we need further help. Luckily our Physics and Computer sciences students reinforced our team and designed the wiki and created mathematical models.
Besides the daily laboratory work, we all spent some free time together, watching movies cooking, and having fun together. One of the funniest events was our canoe trip, sunny weather but however, wet conditions.

Collaboration with iGEM headquarters
In addition to the usual team collaborations, we communicated with the iGEM headquarters and pointed out that we had difficulties with the pSB1C3 plasmid vector sequence. A restriction digest of the backbone yielded more fragments than expected. Therefore we sequenced the whole backbone and found 7 mutations. Although the vector replicated fine and the antibiotic resistance was functional, we feared potential future problems and sent the correct sequence to the iGEM headquarters. Based on these findings iGEM headquarters introduced versioning of the plasmid backbones and our pSB1C3 was named pSB1C3_001.
Mutations in the pSB1C3 backbone:
Collaboration with the iGEM 2010 Team ESBS-Strasbourg
We established a collaboration with the iGEM 2010 Team ESBS-Strasbourg, who asked for our assembled Biobricks of YFP and CFP cloned into the standard pSB1C3 backbone. We sent out the plasmids so that they could use and test the plasmids for their cloning purposes. To expand our collaboration, the Strasbourg team visited us at our laboratory. Both teams made a presentation of their project and exchanged impressions and ideas about iGEM and the daily laboratory work. After that, we spent time together having a nice barbecue.
 
Collaboration with the iGEM 2010 Team Freiburg Software
The Software Team Freiburg programmed Add-on robots for many applications and could offer us some useful features for our cloning approaches. One of them is for example a primer designer. The primers are designed by choosing the melting temperature and the binding site of the template sequence. The robot finally creates the sequence of the forward primer (Primer 1) and the reverse Primer (Primer 2). Furthermore, the Software Team supported us in the design and coding of our homepage. In return, our team helped with information about biological interests and cloning procedures and organized the t-shirts and the trip to Boston.
Example for the functioning of the primer designer robot:
 
 
Collaboration with the iGEM 2010 Team Stockholm
The iGEM Team Stockholm 2010 was interested in using the Freiburg standard 25 and contacted us in order to get information about cloning vectors from our stocks concerning the three pSB1X3-derived BBa_J18901-3 plasmids, as well as the pMA (-BBRF) vector (BBa_K157000) available in the Registry. We made the advice that the Freiburg iGEM 2009 team last year used the pMA vector for almost all cloning steps. The plasmid is small and delivers high yields of plasmid DNA. In comparison to that the larger BBa_J18901-3 plasmids carry two antibiotic resistances making the part assembly more restricted.
Community outreach in collaboration with BIOSS and Europa Park
The sience days at Europa Park take place every year making sciences attractive for young people. Pupils of different ages take a look in sciences by doing practical experiments and playing games. In association with BIOSS we prepared a game for the younger kids, in which they could actively join in. The game gives the kids an imagination about a cells inner life by playing the role of kinases, phosphatases and signalling proteins. In addition, we made questionnaires and tested the knowledge of the pupils in biology.

iGEM focuses on science, but also encompasses community outreach, communication, representation and last but not least, fun in the lab. All this is often communicated best with visual impressions. Several team wikis feature great photos, but some of them are hard to find. Therefore, we thought it would be best to bundle them and highlight the best ones to maximize impact. This is why we started an iGEM photo-contest: The Cuckoo Clock Competition. As the name implies, the first prize is an original Cuckoo Clock typical for the gorgeous Black Forest surrounding Freiburg. All teams are cordially invited to participate! Please send your pictures of choice representing your team, project, spirit or fun in the lab along with a short description to our e-mail address:     igem.freiburg.2010@googlemail.com
Your pictures will be uploaded to the competition webpage as soon as we get them. In addition, we will send you a participation badge for your team wiki. A judging committee consisting of members from three different iGEM teams will vote for the winner picture.  The team with the best picture will receive our amazing Cuckoo Clock in Boston at the socializing event on Sunday. So put your stressful projects aside for a few minutes and take the fun part!
Looking forward to meeting you in Boston.
Cheers,
The iGEM team Freiburg 2010

Nevada
Our long term goals are to develop plant biosensors that reliably measure changes in the local environment. In the process of developing biosensors, the 2010 Nevada iGEM Team need to develop fundamental promoters, reporters, and plasmids for plants. Therefore, the 2010 Nevada iGEM Team has three goals for this year’s competition. First, we are going to test the validity of utilizing Nicotiana tabacum (NT cells) as a model for the expression of higher plant genes for future iGEM competitions. NT cells are a faster, cheaper, and safer model than traditional plant transformation. These cells can therefore be utilized as a quick proof-of-concept test model before moving synthetic constructs into plants of interest. We also aim to produce an iGEM-compatible plant-specific plasmid, several stress-inducible plant promoters, reporter genes containing Kozak sequences (ribosome binding sites) and terminators that conform to BioBrick standards. Lastly, we hope to measure the induction of these stress promoters in real-time by performing a fluorometry assay in which stress will be applied to NT cells and fluorescent output by a reporter (GFP) will be measured to detail induction in real time. This method has a distinct advantage over microarrays since microarrays are only one ‘snapshot’ in time.
Korea_U_Seoul
First one which has 3 people. Tzu Chi university, where the workshop was held, is a Buddhist school. We had a vegetarian food there. We had a photo session at the end of the workshop, and there we took this one in memory of Buddhism. Can you feel the Buddha spirit?
Second is all of our members who went to the workshop. We don't just gather to take a pictures. We follow concepts and orders. Do we look like real scientists?
We took last one in lab. We are almost done with every thing and getting ready for Jamboree! We had to take a rest and there was not enough room for us to sit down... We sat on a chair one on one... and stacked ourselves... We are happy it's almost done, though! =)

Canoe excursion
One of our greatest adventure outside the laboratory: Driving a canoe requires team work and arrangement. Everybody has to paddle synchronously, otherwise there is no chance to stay dry. A must do in team challenges!
Team meeting in the pizzeria
One of the meetings in our numerous row, a comfortable atmosphere to make further project plans is guaranteed.
ScieTalk in Heidelberg
ScieTalk is the student congress of science in Germany giving young scientists and professors the chance to present their innovative ideas without any participation fee. This year, it was the first time that it took place in Heidelberg. A good opportunity to get impressions of poster presentations, to meet interesting people and maybe a potentional sponsor for the own project. We also had the chance to meet Mr. Kleinschmidt from the DKFZ and thanked him for many of the aav plasmids and antibodies against aav we received from him.
Barbecue on the roof
Having a barbecue on the wondeful top of our biology building. To be a good scientist, sometimes there should be a break and something to eat.
Any given Sunday... literature session
Regular brain stormings to complete the needed knowledge for our project. By discussing the literature in small groups it is easier to keep everything in mind.
Get to know the team... in the kitchen
The best way of getting to know each other: working together in the lab kitchen, sharing the same implements and receipts for cooking and finally having a good meal.
How to build a virus capsid
Aim of the experiment: Build a virus capsid.
Methods and materials: Team and instructor parts (iGEM Team 2010, Freiburg) arranged in a stochiometry ratio of 1:1:10, regulated by team coding elements.
Results: 20 people enjoying the wonderful process of virus assmbly.
The press visits our lab
Our project in a public focus: A journalist from the german radio station ""Deutschlandfunk"" came to visit us in our lab. An interesting experience to be interviewed and to represent our project for a general publicity.

We are grateful for support from the College of Engineering, the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences, and the Weill Institute.
Advisors
Dr. Xiling Shen
Dr. Xiling Shen has been an assistant professor in the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Cornell University since August, 2009. He received his BS and MS degree from the Electrical Engineering Department of Stanford University in 2001, and has performed post doctorate work at the University of California, Berkeley in systems and synthetic biology.
Dr. Matthew DeLisa

His research focuses on the integration of engineering principles with protein biochemistry, microbiology and modern biotechnology. Professor DeLisa has received many awards for both teaching and research, and has recently been recognized as a Sloan Foundation Faculty Fellow and received the Cornell Provost’s Award for Distinguished Scholarship.
Dr. Pengcheng Bu
Dr. Pengcheng Bu is a postdoctoral associate in the Cornell University School of Electrical and Computer Engineering. His work under Professor Xiling Shen focuses on systems and synthetic biology. He received his PhD from the Chinese Academy of Sciences Institute of Biophysics, and has also performed post doctorate work under Dr. Lin He at the University of California, Berkeley investigating the function of microRNA in cancer development.
Undergrads
Bernard “Big Ben” Cammarata
Originating from the small town of Southborough, Massachusetts, Ben always had big things on his mind.  Like real big.  Cornell big.  After being accepted into Cornell in 2007 (he is currently a senior BEE major), Ben set his sights on curing all the world’s problems.  How did he plan on doing this? Well, establishing a universal dictatorship solely under his control did not work out so well, so he decided to join the Cornell Genetically Engineered Machines team instead.
Alyssa “Adrenaline” Henning
Alyssa, a senior Bioengineering major, was raised by penguins after she fell out of a boat.    She graduated as a valedictorian from Bakersfield High School in California, where it never snows, and then found herself attending Cornell University, where it often snows, making her surrogate penguin parents quite happy.   After making 3D movies of embryonic organogenesis via micro-CT (X-ray imaging) in Dr. Jonathan Butcher's lab and hanging out with the CU GEM team for almost three years, she has found that not everything can be reduced to black or white.  (Cells can fluoresce in different colors.)  When she is not in the lab, she enjoys playing her clarinet, hitting people with Kali Eskrima sticks, hitting even more people with Muay Thai boxing gloves and shin guards, and flying fiery, avian creations off of roofs of Engineering College buildings.
Malinka Walaliyadde
Malinka Walaliyadde was born in Sri Lanka but moved to the UAE when he was 6 months old and basically grew up there. He is currently a junior at Cornell University and is a confused Materials Science Engineering major who has an almost unhealthy interest in molecular biology. When he applied to the GEM team as a freshman, the team leader at the time was hesitant about taking him on because he couldn’t handle a pipette, let alone clone stuff. However his awesomeness shone through and he was let in, which was a good thing because he has continued to be awesome ever since.
Maneesh ""The Mathemagical Beast"" Gupta
The brainchild of a Cornell mathematics student and the number 42, Maneesh is the result of the cross product between complex eigenvectors and the spherical coordinate system.  Needless to say, Maneesh can only communicate to others by using Fourier Transforms. Being a beast of mathematics, Maneesh tested out of every single math class that was offered at Cornell. He then became the head of the Mathematics department, but was quickly fired after it was discovered that he was using Taylor series expansions on undergrads. When asked why he wanted to join the Cornell Genetically Engineered Machines team, he responded by solving the Schrödinger equation for E. Coli.
Deborah Liu
Deborah is a sophomore Chemical Engineer from San Francisco, California. She’s usually described as ""way too intense"", but is working on being more amiable. If not working on problem sets or making/eating delicious food, she can always be found not getting enough sleep or correcting other people’s grammar.
Nancy Li
Nancy is best described through anecdote. We present to you the following:
1. She has invented the better mousetrap, armed with nothing more than a tennis racquet, a skipping rope, two orange cartons, a garbage bag and a piece of cheese. Not only is her contraption cheap, safe, and effective, it manages to consistently teleport the mouse a number of miles away, thus eliminating the mouse problem and utilizing technology years ahead of its time in one fell swoop.
2. She once went without sleep for 36 hours while remaining lucid enough to finish a 4000 word paper on the Anglo-Chinese War of 1839. Two days after this experience, she was forced to blow up 200 balloons for the Multicultural Show and then continued to host the three hour show without indicating any panic about the twelve exams that awaited her the following week. True story.
3. At age 19, she’s moved more than twenty times and attended more than twelve different schools in three different countries. Basically, she's about as versatile as the bacterial colony we affectionately dubbed 'Chloe' that she's posing with. We swear we don't let our LB grow rogue colonies on a regular basis.
What else is there to say?
Angela Pring-Mill
Angela is a Senior Animal Science major who enjoys peaceful evenings in the lab with the warm crackle of a Bunsen burner.  She first learned how to use a pipette freshman year and has not been able to set one down since.  She was born in Canada, raised in Florida, and spent high school in Oregon, but there is no better place than Ithaca, NY where the winters are everlasting and you get frostbite walking to class.  Working with the CUGEM team has allowed Angela to overcome her intimidation of bioengineers and appreciate the scientific process, filled with all its stops and turns.
Jim Matthew
James Mathew is a sophomore Biological Engineering student at Cornell University interested in biomolecular and protein engineering. Besides enjoying long walks on the beach, James also prefers spending his extra time working on a device to detect infectious diseases using DNA-nanobarcodes in Dr. Dan Luo’s research laboratory, and organizing campus events for the Cornell Entrepreneur Organization.  After moving to New York, James developed low iron levels from a sore lacking of good beef from his home state of Nebraska. He joined CUGEM for the cool stickers and stayed for the creative freedom to invent and explore the possibilities of synthetic biology.
Hyundo Reiner
Hyundo was born in a small town in the Republic of Sudan. At the age of two, he was found alone in his cradle by a wandering salesman after a group of local bandits had looted his home and frightened away the inhabitants. The salesman took him along his travels across Africa to the Ivory Coast, where recent newlyweds and avid travelers Robert and Dorothy took custody of him and smuggled him back into the States. Although Hyundo regards himself as an American, he will usually speak in Sudanese while his interpreter translates.
Virginia Li
Virginia is an Ohioan by birth, a Cornellian by reputation, and a free spirit by inclination.  She joined CUGEM after university administrators removed Introductory Potions from the course roster under the premise that “magic is not real”.  With a dash of synthetic biology and a twirl of her wand (known affectionately as Pipette), she is determined to disprove their argument and restore the legitimacy of magical studies in academia.
Revanth Baddam
Born to vampire parents, Revanth Baddam can trace his family ancestry back to Count Dracula himself. During high school he developed a severe Vitamin D deficiency due to his nocturnal habits. He enrolled at Cornell partly due to the austere dark winters where he can walk the grounds at noon. Currently a junior in Biological Engineering, he has attempted to find a solution to his severe Vitamin D deficiency and has joined iGEM to help him in his quest to aid other vampires with similar conditions.
Archana Rachakonda
Archana is a junior majoring in Bioengineering. Though now a resident of Princeton, NJ, she comes from a humble background of grain farmers, doctors, and Kung Fu masters. Together, they instilled in her a great appreciation of raptors on hoverboards and lolcats. Archana traveled back in time and created DNA (dangerously nascent abacus), but unfortunately, an incompetent History intern misspelled both her discovery and name. Nowadays, she can be found in the Sacred Realm or, at night, in the shadows of Duffield Hall. She joined CUGEM last year as a spy for the Harvard team, but defected when she realized how much better Cornell is. She eagerly awaits the day when she’ll receive a CUGEM t-shirt.
Albert Li
My name is Albert Li. I have a passion for the extraordinary. Four words: corn maze laser tag. That is my dream. Glorious. Absolutely glorious. It's very relevant to biology too. Imagine this. Genetically altered corn that grows angularly or shrinks when approached by heat. An interactive corn maze. Just brilliant. Being an electrical engineer in a synthetic biology team is rather interesting. You tend to find many similarities. DNA nucleotides - bits and bytes. Ion channels or operon pathways - transistors or logic gates. My giant and inadequate brain - a lightbulb that never seems to turn on during team meetings and brainstorming sessions. Its been quite an experience. The realm of the biolab is both diabolically frustrating and teasingly rewarding. It will be cool to see whether what I've learned applies to my future or not. I can't make any accurate predictions, but for now it's just four words.
Katy Sadowski
Katy Sadowski is a junior in the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences at Cornell.  She is a Biology major with a minor in Animal Science and is a member of Cornell’s polo team.  Katy is from Shaker Heights, Ohio.

A bit more about us...
Noah Young is a dashing, young, and battle-hardened Junior in Biomedical Engineering and Applied Mathematics who enjoys finding eigenvalues, sketching quasi-instantaneous current voltage relations for fictional ion channels, and programming robots to take jobs away from hard-working graduate students. In his free time he studies neural stem cells in microfluidic devices and helps manage a $100,000 endowment portfolio.
Justin Porter is a Biophysics major of Junior standing who hails from Seattle, Washington.  His research interests are primarily in computational protein structure prediction and design, but he takes breaks to visit the wet lab when he participates in iGEM.  When he’s not too busy, he enjoys Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, making hummus, long walks on the beach, and silently scaling the rain-slicked walls of ancient Japanese fortresses in the dead of night.
Daniel Wolozny is a Junior Chemical and Biomolecular Engineer from Honduras. Yes, Honduras, that little piece of land that connects North and South America. His research interests range from introducing genes, Bclxl and Bclxl2 to make mammalian cells resistant to apoptosis to learning new laboratory techniques. He enjoys horseback riding through the forests of the homeland and attempting to take the lessons learned in lab into the kitchen setting. Results have been mixed.
Ang “Andy” Tu is a sophomore Biomedical Engineering major from Southern California. After working two years in a immunology lab as a high school student, he joined Dr. Jon Schneck’s pathology lab where he is currently involved with the development of artificial antigen presenting cells for immunotherapy purposes. Though usually quiet and reserved, Andy occasionally surprises those around him with dashes of high-spirited energy and unbelievably inappropriate jokes.
Arjun Karkhar is a sophomore in the biomedical engineering department. He has done research cardiomyocyte monolayer growth, birth simulator design and mechanics research, and designing and testing genetic switches. He enjoys dancing, painting, cooking, social infrastructure development and science fiction. He wants to be a chef if he grows up.
Roberto Passaro is a junior Chemical and Biomolecular Engineer who weathered the hazards of Westchester, New York for over 18 years before finding his way to Johns Hopkins. He studies the flow and diffusion of nanoparticles through microfluidic devices. His free time is predominately spent playing guitar and wooing women.
Andrew Snavely is a junior pursuing majors in Cellular and Molecular Biology and Neuroscience. His research interests include expression of olfactory receptors in heterologous cells and the genetic control of the epithelial to mesenchymal transition in cancer cell lines. In his spare time, he enjoys backpacking and scuba diving.
Kristin Boulier is a sophomore Cellular and Molecular Biology major from Annapolis, Maryland.  She enjoys playing with DNA, parasites (a problem exacerbated by her summer in a malaria lab), cooking and playing soccer.
Jonathan LeMoel is a sophomore in the Biomedical Engineering department. Hailing from Destin, Florida, he enjoys spending his very limited free time contemplating the intricacies of quantum mechanics, the creation of self replicating nanobots, and the grand answer to the age old question ""What am I doing?"" He also enjoys playing the guitar, not playing the piano, and the fabrication of microscale boxes.
Zheyuan Guo is senior Chemical and Biomolecular Engineer who found a passion ""mixing"" clear liquids and studying electrophoresis gels. He is currently helping assemble the 3L synthetic chromosome of S. cerevisiae. He enjoys playing poker and chess (simultaneously).

Hao Shi
email
""How is she doin'?"" Yup, that's how I will introduce myself if we ever meet. I'm just a guy going into 3rd year Life Sciences aiming to enter medical school like any other life-sci. Aside from that ambition, I have a little engineer inside my brain that craves innovative challenges, which is what brought me to iGEM. To top that off, I need to admit my addiction to badminton... it takes up about 20% of my awake-hours each week. Sherlock Holmes would deduce either I sleep a lot or I play a lot of badminton... or I might be over-exaggerating. Summary: Med school + engineer + badminton = Hao Shi = Awesome!! QED =)
Mary Tao
email

Yuli Zhang
email
Hi. I am a third year life sciences student. I am really interested in molecular genetics and participating in the iGEM competition as a QGEM member has given me the chance to learn more about synthetic biology. The QGEM team worked on engineering C. elegans this past summer. The project was very challenging (if you don’t believe me, try going through all of our gel images) and yet very rewarding (we got a transgenic worm)! The team worked mostly in Dr. Chin-Sang’s lab. When we are running gels we didn’t want to mistakenly take one of the lab’s gel, so we wrote, “You can run, but you can’t hide. iGEM” on tissue paper and laid it under our gel box. What it meant was the DNA can run through the gel by applying an electric field but afterwards, we can image the gel and find the DNA band.

The aim of our project is to create a bacterium that can detect several heavy metals in water : Arsenic, Cadmium and Mercury. If arsenic is present, GFP is expressed. If mercury, RFP is expressed. If cadmium, we can see cells become brown. This is because of amd gene products.  The bacteria contain all the three genes. Therefore, when more than two heavy metals is in water, each color is mixed so we detect several metals simultaneously. Freezedrying and Capsuling of bacteria, carrying is easier.

And finally to Yagiz , Hilal , Joanna and Olga for flying over to Boston to represent the Macquarie University team at iGEM Jamboree 2010!
Macquarie's first year in the iGEM competition:
what we have achieved
This is the first time that we have been lucky enough to enter this competition. We should note that all the gene cloning experiments conducted over the past 5 months have been carried out by the six Undergraduate team members. Professor Robert Willows kindly provided us with the pET-3A vector with the Heme Oxygenase gene already inserted and the sequencing was done by the Macquarie Sequencing Facility.
We have established a foundation upon which Macquarie University teams can build on in future years and will encourage students to take part in such a fantastic competition and have as much fun as we have!

Thorsten Heidorn
Thorsten Heidorn
Researcher at the Department of Photochemistry & Molecular Science.
Primarily I am interested in using photosynthetic microorganisms such as green algae and cyanobacteria for the biotechnological production of valuable products, particularly the potential future energy carrier hydrogen. About 4 years ago I got in contact with the idea of synthetic biology for the first time and saw immediately the big potential of this approach for my research. Last year I initiated the first iGEM team in Uppsala which was a great success, and now it comes year number two...
Daniel Camsund
Daniel Camsund
PhD student at the Department of Photochemistry & Molecular Science.
Within the greater goal of renewable production using solar energy, I’m working with the design and implementation of biological tools and systems in the photosynthetic cyanobacteria. This includes transcriptional and post-transcriptional control, development of standard (BioBrick) plasmids and heterologous expression of hydrogenases. Additional research interests include light-regulated transcription and in vivo localization. Developing and advising iGEM-teams (Uppsala-Sweden 2009 & 2010) provide me with inspiration, and will hopefully help in advancing Synthetic biology.
HsinHo Huang
HsinHo Huang
PhD student at the Department of Photochemistry & Molecular Science.
Optimizing the bio-converting process from solar energy into chemical fuel for the high energy-demanding human society is a great challenge.  Synthetic biology could be one of the solutions to add or modify novel biological functions into the existing organism and eventually design an novel biological system with the desired properties. To generate an array of genetic tools for photosynthetic organisms, my present work focuses on changing gene expression level via promoter sequence modification and quantitizing it in relative to a reference promoter via measuring fluorescence of a fluorescent protein. This year I was also involved in coaching the iGEM2010 Uppsala team, which is a nice teamwork.

Age: 25
Background: Swedish student with Peruvian roots
Why I wanted to participate in iGEM:  I heard about synthetic biology for the first time in a evening course and loved the combination of different fields in synthetic biology and the standardized engineering vision it has. That suited very well with the broad range of diverse courses I´ve studied in my programme. I became very curious how synthetic biology would work in practice hence iGEM is the perfect opportunity to get a flavor of this exciting new field and cooperate with people with the that same interest.
Interests: meeting people and friends, my family, biotech, synthetic biology, green sustainable techniques, playing piano, listen and dancing salsa, windsurfing, football, psychology, etc

Why I wanted to participate in iGEM: I’m so glad I could be part of this competition and be in this team. I love the idea adding engineering discipline and approach into biology which creates an exciting and useful new biological function and system. As a student studies both in chemical engineering and biotechnology, synthetic biology is really exciting and attractive for me. Though I’m not familiar with this subject, but I love the challenge. I also enjoy working with others to build something from scratch. From the teamwork, I learnt to contribute my part, and to be supportive to the others.

Why I wanted to participate in iGEM:Synthetic Biology has always been a fascinating subject for me. Bringing imaginations to reality by meddling with genes is quite a fun. The iGEM competition not only kindles our creativity but also helps us learn and think. This is also a good ground for learning to work as a team and together we can work wonders! I am happy to be a part of this and I am quite confident our team will succeed in our attempt.

Age:22
Background: Chinese-Swedish
Why I wanted to participate in iGEM:  Biology has always been my favorite subject since middle school. I was intrigued by the way nature works. The knowledge I absorbed along the path of wanting to understand gave me a silver medal from International Biology Olympiad in high school. Synthetic Biology, the art of combining biological systems with engineering discipline, has caught my eyes since freshman year. My dream is to be able to design biological devices with any desired functions. To me, iGEM is the perfect place to get one started. It grants you the opportunity of knowing what's out there as well as the people who share similar aspirations as you.
Interests: singing to my own piano accompaniment, dancing salsa, badminton, basketball, meeting people, seeking the next level, and Synthetic Biology!

Statement
In our iGEM team, I am responsible for the part of preservation, that is to find a way to prolong as much as possible storage time of our bacteria. From previous work, I made several types of preservation media, and our experienment results showed that the bactria in the best media can store for at most 50 days, and still have a considerably high activity.  The process to achieve my goal is full of difficulties and frustrations, through which I learn more about what research is. This experience makes me think twice about what I really want to do about science, about biology and about iGEM. I appriciate that.

Statement The era of interdiscipline has come. And our generation serves as the impulse. Standing on the blurring boundary of Chemistry and Biology, I find that developing chemical tools to study biological issues is becoming more and more vital. Certainly, synthetic biology is one of the most important methods to realize this. Also, science should serve human beings. Practical purpose is the prerequisite and technology transfer is the bridge to make it true. I believe that the project of our team this year has combined the above-mentioned significance, and together we will fight to achieve the grand success in the ultimate.

Conditioned Reflex Mimicking in E.coli
We are engineering our E.coli cells to process the correlation information of two environmental signal, similar to the process of classical conditioning in higher organisms. In our circuits we use a bistable switch as the memory module to represent the memory state; we also constructed a series of AND gates which can sense conditioned and unconditioned signals, and output a repressor protein to change the memory state of the bistable switch. In this way, our E.coli cells can convert the information on the concurrence of two signals to its memory. After the memory module is switched, given the conditioned stimulus, E.coli will activate its reporter module and thus exhibit the ""conditioned response"".

A Genetic Circuit for Directed Evolution in vivo
Directed evolution is a powerful tool for answering scientific questions or constructing novel biological systems. Here we present a simple genetic circuit for in vivo directed evolution which comprises minimal elements for random mutation and artificial selection. We engineer yeast to generate the DNA mutator hAID, an essential protein in adaptive immunity, and target it specifically to a gene of interest. The target gene will be mutated and consequently promptly evolves. By linking the expression of hAID repressor LacI and favorite gene functionality, the mutation rate inversely correlates between the functionality of the desired gene and hAID. This circuit may be adopted for in vivo evolution in eukaryotic system on genetically encoded targets. It has a variety of potential applications in academic and industrial contexts, theoretically most inter-molecular interaction that involves proteins and RNAs.

Towards Self-differentiated Bacterial Assembly Line
Our projects concern with the ability for bacterial cells to differentiate out of homogeneous conditions into populations with the division of labor. We aim at devices conferring host cells with the ability to form cooperating groups spontaneously and to take consecutive steps sequentially even when the genetic background and environmental inputs are identical. To break the mirror in such homogeneous condition, we need two devices respectively responsible for temporal and spatial differentiation. The implementation and application of such devices will lead to bioengineering where complex programs consisted of sequential steps (structure oriented programs) and cooperating agencies (forked instances of a single class, object and event oriented) can be embedded in a single genome. Although this ""differentiation"" process resemble the development of multicellular organism, we tend to use a more bioengineering style analogy: assembly line. Or maybe after some years from now, this will not be just an analogy.

The first time when I heart of Synthetic Biology, I thought it sounds like my favorite robot-model assembling, and felt great interest in it spontaneously. Thanks to IGEM and my teammates, I enjoyed a fabulous summer to understand more about SB. It was also a great honor to do the designing work of our wiki. The internet gave me a convenient platform learning computer language, as well as improving my painting strategy.

Being one part of the iGEM society is a wonderful way to learn about what is going on in the field of synthetic biology, how to share your fancy ideas with people and work collaboratively with team members. Besides, it provides fantastic opportunities to make friends with people in other teams and EVEN have collaboration internationally. Since the PKU iGEM team was founded in 2007, we have been cooperating with other iGEM teams from different countries and continents.
Asia Taiwan Workshop
In the spring, we joined the Asia workshop in Taiwan. We did a presentation to share our idea about heavy metal decontamination kit with other iGEM participants. At the same time, we learned more about projects from other teams and made friends with them. During the discussion with others, we got a deeper understanding about how iGEM was developing and what the future of iGEM would be.

We set up a Google group to improve the communication among Chinese teams. A growing number of Chinese undergraduates are interested in Synthetic Biology and iGEM. This year, there are a dozen of Chinese teams attending in iGEM competition. Some of them are newcomers to this competition. Since Peking University is among the earliest ones to establish the iGEM team in China, we would like to share our experience with other teams. In this Google group ( http://groups.google.com/group/igem-china ), a lot of information about iGEM 2010 competition and the experience of team construction have been shared.  Based on the idea from SJTU-BioX-Shanghai and us, almost all members got together in Shanghai to discuss project design and lab experience in August. On August 5th, teams from 7 top universities in China, SJTU-BioX-Shanghai, ECUST-Shanghai, Peking, Tsinghua, USTC & USTC_Software, ZJU-China, and Sun Yat-sen University all gathered in Shanghai and had a nice day at the iGEM 2010 China Meetup. Each team made a presentation displaying their projects and progresses since the summer began, followed by free questioning and discussion time. Particularly, the leader of our team, Haoqian Zhang, gave a presentation about team construction and development.

Interaction with Paris team
Paris team is our old friend, and we had interaction with them since 2009. This year, a member of PKU 2008 iGEM team joined in Paris team. We offered a set of experiment protocols to help them develop the new tech standard ""openProtocol"". Also, we translated their human practice project in Chinese( download PDF of its Chinese version ), not only to promote the internationalization of their openProtocol tool but also raise awareness of each team to make a better and safer iGEM competition in the future.
