We are Team Berkeley, a cohesive unit of 7 undergraduates and 3 advisers. Earlier this year we planned a complex and risky project, given the short amount of time iGEM made available. We quickly learned each others strengths and weaknesses and developed standard systems of organizational management in order to synchronize our efforts for the many parallel tasks at hand. We created protocols, shared them with one another, and worked together on troubleshooting. Using google docs to keep up with the status of cloning projects, the results of assays, material logistics, or the final steps required to complete a project ensured that through the months of hard work, we fine-tuned our ability to work together. As a team, we have learned firsthand how the synthetic biology community relies on the goal-oriented cooperation of skilled individuals from very different backgrounds and with very different skill sets. Some of us have strong engineering backgrounds while others of us have strong biology backgrounds, but we all share a desire to build synthetic biological systems that solve human problems. We are proud of the project that we have created which we will present at the Jamboree together in October.
Jason Cham is a third year bioengineering student at UC Berkeley. He enjoys watching movies and playing basketball. He's looking forward to the Jamboree and as always, Go Bears!
Xin Xin Lin is a 4th year Bioengineering student at UC Berkeley. When not conducting research or attending classes, she enjoys drawing, crafting, and reading up on art and cake blogs.
Miriam McQuade is a third year Molecular and Cell Biology Major. She enjoys eating food and ballet. When she grows up, she believes she will be a doctor and hopefully one who travels. Her main goal in life is to have many children and ultimately be happy.
Jessica is currently a third-year Electrical Engineering and Computer Science student at UC Berkeley. What she enjoys most about iGEM is being able to work in a team atmosphere.  When Jessica is not in class or sitting in front of a computer, she enjoys swimming, biking, running, and travelling.
He just graduated UC Berkeley with a BioE major.  He plans to attend graduate school in the fall. During his spare time he enjoys playing basketball, feeding squirrels, and making guacamole!
Fourth year Bioengineering major. Enjoys designing his own T-shirts, playing volleyball, spending all day at the beach, and eating cookies. Those close to him claim he has billions of friends, albiet they are all bacteria.
Conor McClune is a 4th year Biochem and Molecular Biology student, minoring in Bioengineering.   He enjoys upbeat music, looming mountains and volleyball, but despises sarcasm. He's currently struggling with an addiction to synthetic biology.
Gabriel studied Spanish and Biology at UCSB, joined the Berkeley/UCSF BioE Ph.D. program in 2008 and Chris Anderson's lab in 2009. Gabriel participated in iGEM because it offered an experience at the intersection of biology, engineering, teaching, leading, and management.
Terry has a master's degree in chemical engineering from MIT and is currently teaching bioengineering at UC Berkeley. He hopes that by doing so, he will be giving students the tools that they will need to repair him when he gets older.
An Assistant Professor in the Department of Bioengineering at UC Berkeley and LBNL, and a principle investigator of the Synthetic Biology Engineering Research Center, Chris is the man with the vision.

Week 8 (June 5 - 11)
6/7
Added 6 ul loading dye to each PCR reaction tube and ran on gel @ 160 V for 17 min
Lane 1 - DNA ladder
Lane 2 - 24-1
Lane 3 - 24-2
Lane 4 - 24-3
It appears that lacZ amplified correctly, but pBAD did not for whatever reason, we had very little template left (PJG408) that could be part of the issue
6/6/11
Ligation for pBAD into pPLAT; put in tube labeled Lig 23-1
6.5 ul H2O
1.5 ul 10x ligase buffer
1 ul T4 ligase
*1 ul vector (23-2)
*1 ul insert (23-1)
- Incubate for 30 min at room temp
Transformation
Followed Dr. Grose’s procedures. Incubated in 37 degree incubator overnight. - Addison
Back on ice @ 3:27
Take out of incubator @ 4:13
6/7
It appears that there is no cell growth on the plate labeled 6/6 23-1
Set up PCR for pBAD following volumes on prev. page
There is lacZ still in stock
Ran on “Phusion10” in Grose’s labe.
+25-1
pBAD recipe same as 24-1
We have pBAD!
PCR clean-up of pBAD
T26-1 PCRup w/ Dr. Grose
Low melt of T26-1 PCRup
Strong band, very nice looking
Cut out gel slice w/ Dr. Grose
pBAD GS T26-1
Ligation of pBAD w/ Dr/. Grose
Used insert: GS T26-1 and vector: GS T23-2
T26-1 pBAD + 23-2
Lig
6.5 ul H2O
1.5 ul 10x ligase buffer
1 ul T4 DNA ligase
3 ul vector
3 ul insert
mix and sit for min
T26-1
Tran
T26-1 + 23-2
pBAD ligation transformed into E. coli DH5alpha
Plate
pBAD 26-1
pPLAT 23-2
Transformation
Placed in 37*C. If we have growth the next thing is colony PCR
We have growth!!
6/9/11
Colony PCR 26-1
Took 8 colonies from plate T26-1 and swirled them in 50 ul of H2O and then plated on “T26-1 lig” and placed the plate in 37*C overnight
Took the PCR tubes with 50 ul of H2O + the 8 colonies + boiled in thermocycle - this will then be used as template for the colony PCR
19 ul of H2O
2.5 ul Rxn buffer
0.5 ul 10mM dNTPs
0.5 ul IG11 (forward) primers
0.5 ul IG 12 (reverse) primers
0.5 ul Phusion DNA polymerase
2 ul boiled colony sample
Master Mix T26-1
171 ul H2O
22.5 ul 5x Rxn buffer
4.5 ul 10 mM dNTPs
4.5 ul IG11
4.5 ul IG12
4.5 ul Phusion polymerase
+ add 2 ul boiled colony sample + 23.5 ul of master mix to each tube
Ran in Phusion 10
OOPS...USE Taq LIKE PROTOCOL CALLS FOR ON COLONY PCR...My bad
This was just the boiled template. I labeled the template and the PCR similarly, my fault...I will label the colony PCR as PCR next time + the template as “T” followed by a number.
Lanes 2-8=Tubes 1-8. No verification of insert. Will retry another colony PCR
Reused colonies 1-8 and boiled them from plate T-26-1
Master Mix A T26-A
171 ul H2O
22.5 ul 5x Rxn buffer
4.5 ul 10 mM dNTPs
4.5 ul IG11
4.5 ul IG12
4.5 Taq polymerase
add 2ul boiled colonies + 23.5 ul of this mix to each tube
Master Mix B T26-B
171 ul H2O
22.5 ul 5x Rxn buffer
4.5 ul 10 mM dNTPs
4.5 ul IG12
4.5 ul IG38
4.5 Taq polymerase
PCR: Ran 26-1 on a gel @165V for 18 min
It worked! It appears that we have pBAD in the pPLAT plasmid
Next step is to sequence the plasmid just to verify that it really worked and then we can put GFP and lacZ into the plasmid as well
No need to sequence...it’s a promoter

Plates moved
Streak plates moved from 30º to 37º @ 7:15 AM; Blue colonies marked w/ a “B” 63 2-11 Moved to 37º @ 7:25 63-12, 13 and 19 are contaminated 63 12-20 placed in 45º (42º?) in Grose’s lab @ 7:45 “Hot flash” plates not moved
Use red to mark the hours
Plates checked at 10:00 AM (Hour 2)
Plates checked at 12:00 (Hour 4) - Devin
Plates checked at 1:00 Hour 5 -Devin
Plates checked at 2:00 Hour 6 - Mark
Look at 5-1 at 3:00
Plates checked at 3:00 - Mark
5-1 (in corner on racks) is starting to look blue
Checked at 4 PM - Chet hour 8
Checked at 5 PM - Mark hour 9
Checked at 6 PM - Chet hour 10
At 6 PM, plates 2-1 were placed in 42º incubator in Dr. Grose’s lab after being marked.
Marked with an “M” the colonies that are now blue in the 42º
Colonies 5-5-10-10 may have been on plates without enough x-gal in them or something, because not even the controls turned blue
9/14/11
Moved room temp plates to 42º 8:30 AM, leave in til 10 AM
Removed 37º-->42º plates
Plate 66-1 (hour 8 colonies)
Repeat check 37º-->42º Start plates incubated at 37º then moved to 42º. Selecting colonies from original plates that were not blue at 37º but turned blue at 42º
66-2
Same as above but for 30º-->42º hours 4 and 5
66-3
Same as above but for hours 8-10
All left at room temp overnight
Plated all the old and new blue colonies from the plates that we watched change hour by hour
The colonies that changed from 37º-->42º are labeled 42-1A-->42-10A
“A” means they were from the new batch
Put in 30º incubator. Dr. Grose would like to see them before we start the next phase of the experiment
9/17/11
Watched the plates for 10 hours and marked as the colonies changed from white to blue

Mark Sabin
Mark after skydiving
Mark is a Senior at BYU majoring in Physiology and Developmental Biology. He is currently planning on going to dental school. Dentistry appeals to him because of the change a good smile can have on an individual's life. This is his fifth semester working as a TA for Dr. Brown in the BYU Chemistry Department. IGEM will be a great way for Mark to broaden his studies and contribute to the growing field of bioengineering. In the winter he enjoys snowboarding, and when its not freezing at 12,000 ft. he spends his time skydiving with his Dad. He is recently married to Ariel Johnson as of April 29th of this year.

Week 16 (July 30 - Aug. 6)
6 August 2011
Turns out the thermosensor primers were bad bad bad.  Dr. Grose performed a cloning using redesigned DeltaTS primers. I looked at the plate today, almost all colonies were big and blue! I set up the boiled template from 7 of the colonies to be able to do colony PCR and check for insertion. Tubes labeled boiled tamplate 47-1. plastic labeling on tubes. Pie slices on xgal plate which plate is in the 30oC incubator.

20 September 2011
Set up overnights for plate reader experiment. This time we used more controls to be sure the plate reader was working properly. We used high-copy plasmids from earlier in the summer as positive controls for fluorescence, and we included promoterless GFP, and blank plasmid, all as negative controls.
21 September 2011
We ran the plate reader experiment longer this time than we had before, just to be sure the superfolder GFP was maturing. We read OD and fluorescence at 3 hours after adding H2O2, and at 5 hours.
3 hour readings
5 hour readings
As the last plate reader experiment, this was a depressing conclusion. The controls worked, and our H2O2 sensor didn't. We were confused because this was the same as the katG promoter from the a published biosensor . Luckily, the thermosensor team was getting great results, which meant our summer's efforts were not in vain.

30 June 2011
Rob set up overnight cultures with the most recently cloned oxyR construct.
1 July 2011
We ran through the first version of the plate reader experiment. It was simple, with only 5 hydrogen peroxide concentrations, based on what we learned about oxyR from Ecocyc.org.  The results were not clear. This first time, we didn't take the OD, which  meant we couldn't normalize for relative fluorescence. This made our results inconclusive.

Week 5 (May 8-14)
5/20/11
After the multiple failed attempts of amplifying LacZ we decided the error could no longer be our fault. We reordered primers, as it turns out sometimes the people who synthesize the primers make mistakes too.
Set up LacZ PCR using the recently ordered primers.
(19-1)
~31 µl ddH20
10 µl 5x phusion buffer
1.5 µl 10mM dNTP’s
1 µl primer IG39
2 µl primer IG40
1 µl diluted template DNA JHG526 (we renamed  pIGGY)
0.5 µl phusion polymerase

Dr. Grose approved our pBAD insert, just said to run a control next time on the gel. Set up overnight on colonies from T26-1 lig plate from slices 2 and 5 (like a pizza! Insert drawing of a pizza)
T28-2-1 through T28-2-4
4 ml LB broth
500 ul Amp
1 tip dipped in colony from slice 2
T28-5-1 through T28-5-4
4 mL LB broth
500 ul Amp
1 dipped in colony from slice 5
Placed in 37*C shaker @ 10:41 AM
15 June 2011
Placed T28-2 through 4 and T28-5-1 through 4 in 4* “incubator” until someone can due a miniprep on them.
16 June 2011
Began Qiaprep Miniprep purification protocol on tubes T28-2(1-4) and T28-5(2-4)
MP T29-2-1 = T28-2 (1+4)
MP T29-5-1 = T28-5 (2+4)
MP T29-2-2 = T28-2 (2+3)
MPT29-5-2 = T28-5 (1+3)
all of T29-2 was combined into one and all of T29-5 was combined into one
Colony 2 plasmid is pIG12
Colony 5 plasmid is pIG13
We need to find the concentration of both of these plasmids with the nanodrop machine, then we can due a restriction digest with lacZ and GFP and insert both of them
pIG 12 -> 137.8 ng/ul
pIG 13 -> 127.8 ng/ul
17 June 2011
We did a Restriction Digest on our pLATBAD construct (pIG12) as well as our LacZ product and GFP product.  They’ll be inserted at our HindIII and XbaI sites.  Started incubating at 2:15pm and removed from the 37oC incubator at 3:50pm.  We then ran a low melt gel on the two inserts and pLATBAD at 90V for 45 min. Placed low melt in fridge. Lets check the RD with Dr. Grose before continuing.

6 September 2011
Matt met with Dr. Grose and talked about the data from Friday's experiment. She felt that, once again, the huge peak was due to cell death. Maybe we were using too much H2O2. We planned to revise the protocol and try again.
9 September 2011
We tried inducing just two strains this time, with ten concentrations of H2O2, instead of five. We covered the span depicted in the table below: 0uM on up to 1mM. We used the plasmids that had only the katG promoter fused to GFP, and only the hemH promoter fused to GFP; pIG31 and pIG32 respectively. As can be seen, the results were less than satisfactory. The random distribution of fluorescence never increased even two-fold.
Plate Reader Experiment Results 9 September 2011
10 September 2011
We attempted the protocol again, only this time with the plasmid that had always given out-of-the-ordinary results before: pIG30 (hemH promoter fused to GFP, with the oxyR gene on the plasmid under a strong constitutive promoter). It didn't fail to look great on the graph. Unfortunately, that was because the cells were dying. Because we normalize fluorescence over OD, with the tiny OD's as H2O2 concentration rose, the normalized fluorescence also rose. It was misleading, and unfortunate. Not a single one of our constructs had proven to be a useful sensor.
Plate Reader Experiment Results 10 September 2011
Moving forward, we've decided to take one more swing at it with an enlarged version of the katG promoter that is closer the version used in the literature . Just to be sure, we're planning the final construct with Pbad to demonstrate the AND gate action, in case the neo-katG doesn't work out.

Week 12 (Jul 3 - 9)
7/5/11
Removed plates from incubator
Plated 8 colonies onto a “pie plate” to check for the amp resistance. Since plate T36-1 was left for longer than just overnight it might not be truly antibiotic resistant (have the plasmid transformed) so we’ll take those 8 colonies and check by incubating overnight on plate T36-2 - Mark
I talked to Dr. Grose about the results from the last colony PCR (on pg. 33). She suggested we redo the colony PCR from plates ∆T30-1 and ∆T30-2 to make sure we didn’t mix things up because the lower bands look like they could have been lacZ and then we would need to redo GFP. So let’s redo the colony PCR from plates ∆T30-1 and ∆T30-2 using the same protocol Devin used on page 32. I don’t have time today, but I can do that a little later this week if no one else can.
7/6/11
Colony PCR for pPLATBad/lacZ-1 (∆T30-1) T37-1
Taq DNA polymerase added las to master mix
IG40 and IG12 as primers
Colony PCR for pPLATBad/lacZ-1 (T36-2) T37-2
Taq added last
IG 40 and IG12 as primers
Colony PCR for pPLATBad/GFP (∆T30-2) T37-3
IG26 and IG12 as primers. Taq added last. - Mark
7/7/11
Lanes 2, 4, and 5 look great -going to set up overnights. -Mark
Lane 3 was a neg. control because there was no growth from that colony.
Just to be clear: colonies 1,3 will be “overnighted” in LB-amp from plate T36-2
T38-1 and 2: from colony 1
T38-3 and 4: from colony 2
Colony PCR 37-3 (from plate ∆T30-2) pPLATBad-GFP
These are at about 300 bp - a little small for our GFP insert. Dr. Grose suggested we purify them anyway and sequence to see what’s going on.
Colonies 2 and 3 will be overnighted to see what’s going on.
T38-5 and 6: from colony 2 from plate ∆T30-2
T38-7 and 8: from colony 3 from ∆T30-2
7/8/11
pIG15: pLATBADlacZ colony 1 (plate T36-2)
pIG16: pLATBADlacZ colony 3 (plate T36-2)
pIG17: pLATBADGFP colony 2 (plate ∆T30-2)
pIG18: pLATBADGFP colony 2 (plate ∆T30-2)
Next step is to digest thermosensor and pIG16 and get on to the ligation! -Mark and Chet

Week 20
August 29
Streaked four blue colonies from each: Lig56-2, 56-3, 57-1 to new plates.  Incubating each colony at 30 celcius and 37 simultaneously.Expected results are that the positive controls will be blue at any temperature while the best thermosensors show drastic white-blue change between 30 and 37.
Low melt on RD 55-1, 56-1, 55-2 (40 micrometers/well) Now labeled gs55-1, gs56-1, gs55-2; put in TS freezer box
Was going to do ligation, but pIG 15 is all gone. Set up a plasmid prep using colonies from IGM 31 plate (Aug 26) 2(5ml LB amp) tubes labeled pIG 15 and a blank put in 37 degree shaker. Need to RD after plasmid prep and run on low melt so we can set up ligations.
Found “el problema” with our media recipe.  Should be 15g agar, not 5g.  So... Making plates correctly.  2L of media.
Bacto-tryptone: 20g
Yeast: 10g
NaCl: 10g
Agar: 30g (!!!)
Arabinose: 0.2g
Amp: 2ml
X-gal: 2ml
August 30
Blank not blank - must’ve been contaminated.  So, just to be safe, set up new set of IGM 31 and blank and put in shaker at 37 again.
August 31
Did plasmid prep on 3 tubes with IGM31 following Qiagen kit protocol Nanodropped it like it’s hot and labeled tubes accordingly.  All 3 tubes between 180 ng/ul and 321 ng/ul.  My class starts in 10 minutes, so no time for RD.  I’ll be back later.
RD - Vector digestion on pIG15 (IGM31)

Addison Alley
What is Addison?
Addison is a question wrapped inside an enigma, wrapped inside a paradox, wrapped inside some sort of a fried batter, served with your choice of fries or house salad. He is also best accompanied with a cold Dr Pepper. When not riding his domesticated white rhinos into battle against any series of imaginary enemies (accompanied by his imaginary friends), Addison is a super-senior microbiology major at BYU (super meaning he is in his 5th year of college, not super-powers or uniqueness, though he does possess the former and his mother would argue on behalf of the latter). He is currently applying to medical school and now understands why interrogators will often force suspects to fill out secondary applications as a strategy to make them break.
While on a secret mission/study abroad program that brought him to London, he met Abby Hartman. He eventually decided to flirt with all of the girls on the trip but her. They were married the following summer. Abby is now Addison’s sugar-mama, working the glamorous, luxurious life of a middle-school teacher.
Addison loves Star Wars, LOST, Fringe, Community, and bacteria. Do not mention them around him unless you like to hear him talk.
Addison records a lot of music; too much if you as me. You can find it here:

20 June 2011
It looks like we mixed something up. Lane 2 was marked as pLATBAD but appears to actually be the LacZ insert. Lane 3 was supposed to be the LacZ insert but appears to actually be the pLATBAD vector.  We cut out the gel slices with the respective inserts or vector and performed ligations inserting LacZ and GFP between the HindIII/XbaI sites pLATBAD.  (3 ul vector and insert for both)
Then the gel slices were placed in a 65oC heat block at 3:05pm to prepare for transformation.
Transformation performed and incubated at 37o overnight following Grose protocol.
Labeled: T30-1 (T30-1 lig/vector+lacZ) and T30-2 (T30-2 lig/vector+GFP)
6/21/11
No growth on T30-1. Only one potential colony on T30-2. Placed both in refrigerator in 888. -Addison
6/22/11
Retry of transformation (same protocol)
We’re going to run a gel on lacZ, GFP, and a few thermosensor PCRs to make sure we have good product
Looks like good PCR product
T22-4 may have gotten lost in clean up or somewhere. T19-1 was a good lacZ PCR product but I was unable to find it
6/23/11
Colonies grew on both GFP plate (30-2) and lacZ plates (30-2) (new plates from 6/22)
Boiled colonies in preparation for colony PCR
lacZ: 30-1-(1-8)
GFP: 30-2-(1-8)
6/24/11
lacZ colony PCR
Taq polymerase protocol. 9 ul of IG40 and IG12 primers
GFP colony PCR
Taq polymerase. 9 ul of IG26, IG12
PCR on lacZ (33-1)
Phusion polymerase. 2 ul of each primer (IG39 and IG40) because they were more dilute
Next step -> run all on gel to check if have product

26 July 2011
Re-doing colony PCR on DeltaTS just to double check. Colony PCR seems inconclusive.
27 July 2011
With the way the bands look again it seems as though the insertion did not happen. Talked to Dr. Grose - it in fact appears that there are even more than just two bands. Thus, she will be doing the cloning of the thermosensor.  :(
28 July 2011
Set up overnights to freeze down strains containing the pLATBAD and pLATBAD respectively.
30 July 2011
Colony PCR from transformations that Dr. Grose set up. (DeltaTS, pBAD, LacZ)
I am taking from as many of the larger blue colonies as I can between the two plates Dr. Grose set up. I may do one or two white colonies to compare.  Tubes and slices labeled 1-8 respectively.  All colonies I ended up taking were blue colonies.
Should be in Dr. Grose’s PCR machine or freezer if someone wants to check on a gel. Boiled template is in our freezer.
I am putting the colony PCR plate in the 30oC incubator at 2:00 pm. (It just has DeltaTS in one of the “pie slices”) Also I plated it on an xgal plate so if the PCR looks good we can just run experiments off that plate. Colonies they came from were blue so it could be really good.
-Julie
I put Dr. Grose’s 4 plates in the fridge in our room. I wasn’t sure what she meant by leaving them out...so at least fridge won’t hurt anything

Lawrence Williams
Lawrence Williams and a waterfall.
Lawrence is a Junior studying Computer Science at BYU. He's loved computers ever since his parents got his grandfather's Tandy 1000 computer that could run only DOS and BASIC, but it ran them well. Since it didn't have any video games his entertainment consisted of putting random numbers into a Quatro Pro spreadsheet and clicking the ""Create Graph"" button.
Since then he's worked in C, C++, Java, Visual Basic, C#, HTML, Javascript, CSS, PHP, and briefly in LOLCODE . Very briefly. He currently works for BYU developing software to manage campus computers and builds websites on the side. Some of his work is available at:

30 August 2011
After plasmid minipreps with the new low-copy constructs, Matt electroporated them into the correct wild-type or OxyR- strains.
Chet, underlining the final construct plans.
31 August 2011
Mackay set up a PCR reaction with high-fidelity polymerase, to amplify our katG and hemH promoters with new restriction sites, in order to clone them into the thermosensor team's construct with minimal work. Matt came in later that night to set up overnights for the next day's plate reader experiments.
1 September 2011
Matt and Mackay were in the lab bright and early to run the plate reader experiment with the new low-copy constructs, and with their minds made up to make no mistakes whatsoever. Indeed, it was basically a flawless execution. All constructs were run in triplicate. The data looked great:
Plate Reader Experiment Results 1 Sept 2011
As can be seen in the top graph, one promoter/oxyR combination construct gave much-increased transcription and expression of GFP. We went home very content.

Week 2 (Apr. 24-30)
Set up and ran PCR on boiled template to check for pBAD insert. To check for instertion we used primers pPlat forward and pPlat reverse. These primers are just outside our multiple cloning site, thus, as this is our first insert, if we have inserted correctly the amplified DNA will be a much longer sequence than if insert is missing. The total length should be slightly longer that 1500bp.

T47-1 placed in 37oC at 3:25 pm
T47-2&3 placed in 30oC at 3:25pm (2 plates because T47-2 might have gotten messed up)
These plates are to see if there is any difference in expression of lacZ at 30oC vs. 37o
--Mark
8/10/11
pBAD PCR, according to standard phusion protocol. Used primers IG37 and  IG38
Looked at 37oC plate compared to 30oC plate. Thermosensor A is white on 30oC plate, but a very dark blue on the 37oC plate. Thermosensors B,C, and D show no apparant difference
Not sure why these thermosensors are acting differently.
Restreaked thermosensor A, and picked several more colonies to compare. Chose colonies and labeled them E-N. Double plated each of these colony streaks one in each 30oC and 37oC, Colony A was repeated as a control to the additional new colonies.

Matt performed the ligations with the fragments from August 18th. Transformed and plated them, for a long night in the 37˚C incubator.
23 August 2011
Rob and Matt set up colony PCR for the previous day's ligations/transformations. Used primers from the low-copy plasmid backbone, and the GFP gene present in each insert.  Rob re-plated the test colonies.
24 August 2011
Rob ran the previous day's colony PCR on gels. We were very excited to see the extremely positive results. Almost every ligation had given at least a few correct colonies... even the ligations from unresolved bands.  Rob started overnight cultures with the positive hits.
Gel Image 24 August 2011
25 August 2011
Matt froze down the positive hits in the -80˚C freezer with some DMSO. Our team kept getting better with database management and storage. Later in the day, Mackay and Matt attempted a plate reader experiment with the new low-copy version of each construct in the DH5α used in the transformation. Mistakes were made ... as so often happens. Matt forgot to make several dilutions, so after the first 1.5 hour stage, they were left with only 25% of the tubes they needed. So, they diluted the already grown tubes into 3 more, further diluting the already dilute mixtures by 4-fold. What with the various complications and mistakes, the results were less than interesting. We noted the problems in the protocol, and prepared a new version for the next time around.

We purified the most recent cloning: pPlat that contained the directionally cloned GFP.
Also, purified the PCR amplification of KatG and HemH from April 19th. By referring to KatG and HemH we are actually referring to the promoters ""PHemH and PKatG"".
26 April 2011
Rob and Mackay ran the restriction digest for the HemH and KatG inserts, as well as the plasmid backbone.
Matt came in later and ran the low-melt gel. The digest worked great and we stored the slices in the -20.
27 April 2011
Matt came in and set up ligations with the fragments from April 26th. If this ligation works, we should end up with a plasmid that contains GFP under the control of an OxyR-regulated promoter. One version will have KatG and the other version will have HemH.
28 April 2011
Neither ligation worked. Not a single colony appeared. We think it may have been a problem with the inserts, so we tried re-amplifying the inserts. More carefully this time.
Even the positive control (far right) was fuzzy. We don't know how well it worked.
29 April 2011
We tried the ligation again, to clone the KatG and HemH promoters in front of GFP. Dr. Grose thinks that even though the PCR looks fuzzy, they probably worked, so the restriction digested fragments came from that PCR run. Dr. Grose suggested re-digesting the pPlat/GFP plasmid again, if this ligation doesn't work.

Set up overnight cultures for plate reader experiment on the 16th.
16 September 2011
Results from the plate reader experiment.
Last week's results were misleading. Dr. Grose showed us how the OD was so low, that when we normalized the fluorescence it made it appear like the cells were responding to the H2O2, but not so. This weeks results were no different.

Matt made another to-do list. ""Streak OxyR- to singles for electroporation, set up overnight cultures for plasmid preparations, etc.""
Mackay, minipreping.
16 August 2011
Prepared overnight cultures, and planned restriction digests to transfer our multiple cloning sites from the high-copy pPlat into the iGEM low-copy pSB4A5. Notebook diagrams helped determine the appropriate restriction enzymes.
First Sketch
Second Sketch
Those with oxyR on the plasmid would be cut with XhoI and BamHI, while those without oxyR would be cut with XhoI and PstI.
17 August 2011
Overnight cultures were set up with all the constructs to-date, prepared for Plasmid minipreps the next day.
18 August 2011
Minipreps gave decent results. The get was made from old, slimy buffer, and looked a bit rough, but at least confirmed that plasmid was indeed purified. The miniprep for the low-copy plasmid was a bit more involved because two columns were run in parallel, with double the pellet size, to quadruple the amount of plasmid DNA in the final elution stage.
Gel Image 18 August 2011
Restriction digests were set up with the pre-determined enzymes. Predicting the fragment length took a bit of 3x5 card calculating to figure out, but the predicted gel was almost spot on. When the digests were run on the low-melt gel, the plasmids with oxyR in them didn't resolve into separate bands because the length of the backbone was about the same as the insert. Both were cut out together.
Mackay, master of the pipetman

15 October 2011
Like a bolt of lightening, we realized that we had been growing the beta-galactosidase o-NPG overnights in LB that had no arabinose.  Without arabinose, the pBAD promoter would not allow transcription of our thermosensor and the lacZ gene.  This just further proved our concept of an AND gate, but had foiled our beta-gal assay.
18 October 2011
We repeated our beta-gal assay this time remembering to use the broth that has arabinose for the overnights and not just the diluted cultures.  After running the assay this time, all our controls worked wonderfully.  Our actual experimental runs however did not work, confusing us a little.
21 October 2011
Time flies! One week until the next wiki freeze.
We reviewed the goals from last week and made some updates:
Beta-gal assay on Tuesday - Devin, Addison, Mark
Modeling Research on Wednesday - Julius, Matt, Mackay
Matt compare delta-g's from various sources online and correlate with qualitative info
Julius, use false data points to create framework for thermosensor graphs, and Hill coefficients, to be ready for actual data
Primer Design Today - Julie, Chet
Presentation, add RNA alignment with mutations indicated- Addison
SoxS testing 26th Oct or sooner - Matt and Mackay
Outreach planning: get supplies and plan activities at Wasatch elementary- Julie
Wiki curator, upload video from Indianapolis - Lawrence
Poster curator forever - Chet
Thank you notes for ORCA, the Dean, and MMBio - Mark, do you want to be in charge of organizing this?

27 September 2011
Everyone was rushing around today trying to finish work before the wiki freeze tomorrow.
Julius was working hard on the math modeling of our AND gate system.
Julie, Mark and Devin all frantically purifying thermosensor plasmids to stick in the mail and overnight to Boston.
Lawrence was updating the wiki constantly, because frazzled team members needed help uploading notebook pages.
Dr. Grose was relieved when the BYU sequencing center was able to get the thermosensor sequences to her (the sequencing center had been off-line for almost two weeks).
It was a week of late nights, early mornings, and many discarded pipette tips, but with one day to go, it looks like we'll make it.
4 October 2011
First attempt at a beta-galactosidase assay with o-NPG failed.  Only one of the positive controls turned yellow, so we are obviously doing something wrong or our reagents have gone bad.
7 October 2011
Second attempt at the beta-galactosidase assay was worse, only a slight hint of yellow in one of our positive controls.  Due to our approaching trip to Indiana, we scrapped the assay before finishing and finished tweaking our poster and presentation.

2 May 2011
The ligation didn't work, from last week. We re-digested the pPlat/GFP vector and did another PCR cleanup/digest with our small promoter fragments (HemH and KatG).
3 May 2011
Today, Dr. Grose helped us run the restriction digest on the vector and HemH/KatG inserts. We did it all in her lab so she can pull them off the 37 degree heating plate. We pre-poured the low-melt gel for tomorrow.
4 May 2011
We ran the digests on the low-melt gel. Dr. Grose wants to cut out the slices herself, so we wrapped the gel in plastic wrap and stored it in the fridge. The bands showed up ""okay"".
Dr. Grose cut slices out, but said next time we shouldn't run the KatG and HemH inserts on the gel because they're too small.
6 May 2011
Ran the ligation again with Dr. Grose's gel slices. Transformed into DH5a and hoped for the best.

Ran on a low melt gel. Bands appeared appropriate size for respective DNA -Julie
7/13/11
Set pIG16, pIG17, and pIG15 up to be sequenced. We are especially curious to see what the 300bp gene was that was inserted (see July 7th)
Set up two ligations. One with our thermosensor and pPLATBADLACZ, and another with pPLATBADGFP (unsure if we acutally have GFP inserted, sequencing submitted as check)
7/15/11
Transformation. Did two transformations one for our recently ligated pPLATBADLACZ∆TS (40-1), and one for pPLATBADGFP∆TS (40-2) respectively.
100 microliters of transformation 40-1 plated on plate 40-1. 100 microliters of transformation 40-2 plated on plate 40-2.

Week 6 (May 22 - 28)
May 23 LacZ ran on gel-product YES!
LacZ PCR cleanup
Cleaned up LacZ according to Qiaquick protocol and labeled as T 20-1(needs to be checked on gel)
May 25
Restriction Digest of LacZ and GFP
Digested GFP at the HindIII and XbaI sites
oops...we realized that our reverse LacZ primer had a BglII site in it when we needed an XbaI site. Dr. Grose ordered a new primer with an XbaI restriction site in it.
Confirming pBAD clones by restriction digest
5uL buffer 4
0.5 uL BSA
30 uL plasmid(pIG 17-4 and 17-5 each in individual tubes)
12uL H2O
THEN MIX WELL AND ADD:
1.5 uL BamHI-HF
1.5 uL EcoRI-HF
If the gel shows two bands then pBAD was inserted successfully into pIG17-4 and/or pIG17-5. The Digest of pIG174 will be labeled as RD 20-4 and the digest of pIG17-5 will be labeled RD 20-5.
placed RDs in 37oC bath overnight and placed in the freezer
May 27
Running RD 20-4 and RD 20-5 on an agarose gel. We will be using a digested pBAD gene and pPLAT digested at BamHI and PstI as our controls on the gel.

Week 3 (May 1-7)
5/2/11
Ran gel on colony PCR products. Faint bands that are a bit above 1500bp are visible. Much bolder bands visible further down the gel. Not sure if pBAD inserted or not. Set up overnights using colonies 4 and 5 (the faint bands were darkest here). We plan to have these colonies sequenced to find out for sure if pBAD did insert.
5/4/11
Left overnights in for two nights! Going to proceed with plasmid prep—it’s up to QIAgen now. Set up PCR to amplify LacZ, used phusion polymerase. Lengthened extension time to six minutes on PCR machine. Used plasmid JHG526 as our template DNA.

9 May 2011
The ligation WORKED!!! Finally! Mackay picked 8 colonies from the ligation plate and re-patched them onto new plates. He also suspended part of the colonies in water and boiled them, to use as template for the colony PCR. Matt came in later and set up the colony PCR.
Looks like every colony but one had the correct insert.
10 May 2011
At Dr. Grose's request, Matt came in and set up a diagnostic restriction digest to make extra sure the ligation had worked. Digested with EcoRI and XhoI.
May 12
Added new primers to database. Replated colonies so we could freeze down some strains tomorrow.

Chet Chamberlain
Chet and his wife, Michaela
Chet will graduate from BYU in April 2012 with a major in microbial genetics and biotechnology and minors in molecular biology and business management.  He was first attracted to his field of study by an iGEM presentation he stumbled across on YouTube a few years ago.  He would love to solve some of the world's greatest problems through synthetic biology.
Chet is on an intramural ultimate frisbee team, in two local airsoft clubs, and teaches a New Testament class at his church.

3.1October 27th
22 October 2011
Retried the beta-galactosidase assay again, but placed the cultures at 30˚C and 42˚C to see if we could get our thermosensors to allow expression of the lacZ gene.  We hypothesized that the genes were acting over different temperature regions in a broth versus on a plate.  The solutions once again refused to turn yellow, making us sad.
25 October 2011
After growing the E.coli strains on plates at 30˚C, 35˚C and 37˚C, we suspended colonies in a saline solution to approximately 1.00 OD600 and repeated the beta-gal assay.  This time all of the E.coli with our different thermosensors grown at 37˚C eventually turned yellow, but because of the time it took to turn yellow, our Miller Units were very low and data was not definitive.  In the mean time, part of our team was inspiring future iGemmers in an outreach effort.
Also today, new optimized thermosensors were cloned into our pPLATBADLACZ vector. We plated approximately 20 plates of new transformants and grew at 30C.
Outreach Efforts 25 October 2011
We began our outreach at a local elementary school. We decided to approach an elementary school because, for many of us, that is where the seeds were planted that grew our love for learning-especially science. Below are some activities we did with a class of fifth graders.
Student taking notes, no wonder ""Are You Smarter than a Fifth Grader?"" is a hard question to answer yes to
We showed the kids how to extract DNA from strawberries. It was a fun experiment that got them thinking about DNA, genes, and cells. After talking about DNA we talked about how the genes found in DNA make strawberries strawberries. We got many curiosity questions like, ""Could you make a watermelon strawberry?"" The kids were very proud when their DNA extraction worked and they could see the DNA clumping up.
To introduce the idea of bioengineering we did an active exercise with the kids. We had most of the class get in a circle formation around their desks, they created the cell. We then selected a few kids and labeled them with a specific gene (clockwise, smart, red, etc.). Once the ""gene"" made it into the cell, the cell had to express the gene. We explained how we can choose different genes like that to get the cell to do what we want it to do. We also gave them a new vocabulary word, Apoptosis.
Trying to make cell
""Genes"" for cell
October 27th
Today the logically optimized and randomly optimized thermosensors were transferred from 30C to 37C to select best colonies. Most of the plates had colonies which were too numerous to perform an effective screen.  After 8-10 hours of screen randomly optimized appeared uniformly blue, contrary to what would be expected. The logically optimized had slight variation. I streaked 7 promising colonies from the logically optimized clones against thermosensor A on 3 plates which were each placed at 30C 35C and 37C to compare effectiveness of these thermosensors.

Results from plasmid purification.
Purified plasmid from overnights containing SoxS and HemH with the weak, medium, and strong promoters for SoxR and OxyR, respectively.
June 22
Did colony PCR to find OxyR medium and SoxS strong constructs.
June 23
Electroporation: plasmids with GFP only and GFP with the SoxS promoter into SoxR- strains; plasmids with GFP only and GFP with either the HemH and KatG promoters into OxyR- minus strains; plasmids with GFP only and GFP with one of the SoxS, HemH, and KatG promoters into wild-type E. Coli strains.

11 July 2011
Matt set up restriction digest with the GFP/Katg plasmid (pIG14). Also, he set up overnights for several constructs in order to purify the plasmid the next day.
12 July 2011
Matt re-did the ligation with the OxyR-Med fragment and the HemH promoter.
He also purified the plasmids from the overnights on 11 July, and entered them into the team database.
14 July 2011
Mackay came in and tried the OxyR-Med ligation again. Since it hasn't been working, we checked the iGEM website. We realized that the ""medium"" strength synthetic promoter we got from iGEM was actually the ""strong"" promoter. So, we think this OxyR-Med maybe is cloning, but simply overwhelms the cells with too much OxyR expression and inhibits growth.

Colon Cancer Detection Questions
Can isopeptags be used to detect a cancer biomarker and then create a response inside the cell? If not, what other transmembrane proteins can?
Heat Production
Diagram of proposed mechanism
What's a good ""cold switch"" - a riboswitch that would stop transcription at a specific temperature?
Does the UCP1 create enough heat, fast enough, to make a difference?
Does activation of UCP1 harmfully inhibit ATP production? Or can we overproduce ATP to compensate?
CO Detection
Can E. coli be altered to survive in CO long enough to detect it?
7 January 2011
Heat Production
We discovered that the yeast heating project was originally done by an iGEM team from Valencia. If we continue with it, our original contribution would be linking it to a riboswitch, and optimizing the heating mechanism. Addison also suggested optimizing it in E. coli because they grow in denser colonies (it has already been shown not to be lethal in E. coli, but we aren't sure if it produces heat).
Furthermore, there is a better chance of E. coli heating its environment more efficiently as the UCP-1 protein would be expressed on its membrane as opposed to the mitochondrial membrane.
Pamphlet printing is cheap, and Rob volunteered to work on the graphic design.
Colon Cancer Detection
We've found that cancer cells produce more reactive oxygen species than normal cells.  E. Coli already has detection systems for ROS so  we could couple those detection systems with some sort of report to detect the ROS. Such as GFP for fluorescence, or banana aroma for a little added flavor.
The carbon monoxide project ...
10 January 2011
We discovered that the CO detection project was already done by an iGEM team last year.
Brainstorming:
Sound-sensitive bacteria using TRP channels or MSCL channel
Engineer Lactobascillus to add vitamins to yogurt
ROS sensor in E. coli to detect cancer (and/or heat sensitivity)
Thermogenesis in E. coli
12 January 2011
Continued Brainstorming
Caffeine synthesis (Starbacts :)
Creating a psychrophile (cold-loving) E. coli (E. skimocoli :) using phychrophilic proteins, chaperonins and UCP1
Pathogenic plasmid-sharing bacteria (shares lactase-encoding plasmid with other flora in gut)
Fabric (long bacteria that interlace ... create polymer within cell then allow to die ... when cell dies, long polymers are already interlaced)
Paper (decompose plant matter and create pulp that can be made into paper)
Sound detection (TRP proteins, MSCL + MSCS proteins in bacteria)
Organic nanowires
Electron sharing between species
Cell migration
We settled on Cancer detection, when all was said and done...
Colon Cancer Detection Mechanism Proposals for Continued Research
The idea is to detect various inputs and create unique reporters or levels of reporters according to inputs. To detect colon cancer we would focus on two or more of the following:
Unique metabolic products (Fermentation - lactic acids)
Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS)
Heat Detection (Riboswitch)
Collagen cutting enzymes (detect the byproducts)
Unique parts will include: ROS sensor (fine-tune those existing in nature), Riboswitch sensitive to specific temperature, and multi-input switch (creating our own).

Pamphlet Design
Trifold Pamphlet:

Our Goals within iGEM
What we need
How you can help
14 January 2011
Wrote pamphlet text. See Papers section.
19 January 2011
Proofread pamphlet text and plan to take pictures on Friday. Friday afternoon, Addison and his friend will work on the layout.
Started research in earnest for colon cancer biomarkers that will be useful in our project.
ROS are decreased in cancerous cells
ROS are increased in CRC
ROS-sensing transcriptional regulators already in E. Coli are OxyR, SoxR, and FNR.  These could potentially be used to detect different concentrations of ROS.
Biomarkers Unique to Colon Cancer
Carcinoembryonic antigen
Detection of Glycoprotein 87 Using Monoclonal Antibody Adnab-9
Consistently Reported Candidate Biomarkers - Check last pages for lists of genes/proteins
TFF3 and GDF15
Goals for Next Few Weeks
Subjects to Study: Circuit design Directed evolution Mathematical modeling Colon cancer biology basics Other tools that will be useful.
Professors to give lectures: Dr. Clement Dr. Grose Dr. O'Neil Dr. Griffitts
21 January 2011
Assignments: Matt and Rob - ROS Transcription Factors
Addison and Chet - Riboswitches
Mark and Cameron (and Josh?) - Colon Cancer Specifics (Where are biomarkers released? Where and how does it develop, etc.)
Mackay and Julie - AND/OR Gate mechanisms AND Gate Mechanism
GOAL: Detailed strategy and schedule within two weeks
24 January 2011
Can internal biomarkers be used by our E. coli if the cells die and are found in the stool?
What biomarkers are common to most colon cancers?
What are the stages of cancer development and how much do signals/biomarkers change through the stages?
ROS/ROM's ... do they reach the environment? What causes them? Are they a good signal?
Anatomy and pathophysiology of the cancer? What is a polyp? Where does it dump things out? Is a polyp made only of cancer, or is it made of mixed cells?
And Or Gate Switches
Various Gates-AND,OR,NAND,XOR,NOT Various promoters How to get best combined response from two inputs
Colon Cancer
Colon cancer begins as normal colonic epithelium which can develop into an adenomatous polyp which can further develop in to an invasive cancer polyp-abnormal growth of tissue projecting from a mucous membrane Polyps are an early warning for colon cancer.  There are two types of colon cancer: 1.adenoma-pre malignant polyp 2.hyperplastic polyps-rarely forms a cancerous tumor

Mathematical Modeling Example (UBC Example)
28 January 2011
Circuit Design Brainstorming
We spent the day coming up with various mechanisms to express a desired gene in the presence of ROS and heat. Once expressed properly, we would like our marker gene of choice to be expressed constitutively. Following are four proposed mechanisms. The mechanism we have decided to try is the fourth mechanism, which we have named the ""SuperFlp Mechanism."" Below is a diagram.
Basic FLp Recombinase Mechanism: A DNA section that is transcribed normally in the presence of ROS, but there is nothing important downstream. When heated, the promoter inverts (5' to 3' as well as switching strands), leading to transcription in the opposite direction, which contains our desired marker.
IRES Mechanism: The promoter on the strand is ROS activated, but the mRNA lacks a Shine Dalgarno sequence. The SD sequence will be inserted by a heat-activated internal ribosomal entry site (IRES) in the proper position to result in translation of the marker protein.
Riboswitch Mechanism: The presence of ROS leads to translation of protein A. Protein A is required for translation of the desired mRNA coding for the marker. The mRNA starts with a heat-activated riboswitch flanked by LoxP sites and followed by the Cre protein. So, when activated by heat, the heat-sensitive riboswitch will be eliminated, allowing constituent translation. The Cre sequence is followed by a duplicate sequence for protein A.
SuperFlp Mechanism: (Method of choice) An ROS transcription factor is followed by a riboswitch and a Flp recombinase. In the presence of both ROS and heat, the recombinase is expressed, flipping non-local promoter to the desired position. The big question is whether the Flp recombinase's work will be undone by time or the same Flp recombinase. If the recombination is permanent, the E. Coli will continue to express the desired marker even when no longer in the presence of ROS or heat.
January 31 2011
Normal ROS levels in E. coli
Hydrogen peroxide:
""The activity of alkylhydroperoxide reductase (Ahp) is so high that, although H2O2 is formed endogenously inside aerobic E. coli at a rate of about 15 μM/s, the steady-state concentration does not exceed 20 nM.""
""When these higher doses of H2O2 saturate Ahp, the H2O2 concentration rises beyond the 0.1 μM threshold for OxyR activation (48, 58). Catalase is strongly induced, and it becomes the primary scavenging enzyme. The katG-encoded catalase of E. coli exhibits a high Km, so it is not saturated by even millimolar doses of H2O2 (60). Importantly, because catalase dismutates H2O2, its turnover rate is not restricted by the availability of reducing equivalents.""
Superoxide:
""Exponentially growing E. coli contains about 20 μM dimeric cytoplasmic SOD. Given that the rate of O2− formation is approximately 5 μM/s in these cells, the outcome is that the steady-state level of O2− is restricted to approximately 0.1 nM (53).""

16 February 2011
We checked the PCR we ran on Monday and there were only faint bands for OxyR-Weak and OxyR-Medium. We set up the PCR  again and hope it works better this time.
18 February 2011
Gel picture of the PCR we ran on the 16th. Looks great!
23 February 2011
Ran a miniprep using standard protocol.
10 March 2011
Ran PCR to amplify GFP, to clone into pPlat. The primers added an XbaI and EcoRI site to the ends  of the GFP fragment.
21 March 2011
On Wednesday last week we did the restriction enzyme digest using XbaI on the pPlat plasmid and the GFP with both forward and reverse primers containing XbaI (a non-directional cloning). There was some pipetting error that  diluted the solution. We ran it on a low-melt gel and cut out the bands.
Today we ligated the plasmid(pPlat) and the GFP, and transformed into DH5alpha. Addison showed us how to plate the bacteria and we set it to incubate overnight at 37 degrees overnight. Tomorrow we'll put it in the fridge  and continue work on Wednesday.
23 March 2011
Mackay purified the PCR from Monday. We proceeded to digest the GFP insert and the plasmid backbone (pPlat) and prepare them for directional cloning.  We also performed colony PCR on the non-directional cloning from March 21.
25 March 2011
We ran the colony PCR's from 23 March on a gel.  More than half of the non-directional clonings worked!
28 March 2011
Moved colonies from directional GFP cloning to patches. Also set up another colony PCR to check the inserts in that nondirectional cloning.
30 March 2011
Checked colony PCR from 28 March on a gel. Only once colony had the GFP, but that's enough.
6 April 2011
We purified the directional GFP insert plasmid, ran PCR on the multiple cloning site (MCS) and submitting it for sequencing. The GFP insert was perfect, with no mutations, insertions or deletions.
11 April 2011
Mackay did the PCR with the primers on this gel (these serve as templates for each other ... they prime each other to form the OxyS binding site with sticky ends for the ligation step). They worked, according to Dr. Grose. Because the PCR product is so small, Dr. Grose recommended we suspend the DNA in ethanol and spin it down, rather than use a purification kit.
13 April 2011
Restriction digests from last week were left in the 37 degree heating plate for days. Dr. Grose said they may still have worked fine. We ran it on a low-melt gel but only the plasmid showed up ... not our insert. We reviewed the primers we'd used and decided that they probably require template ... we'd designed the primers badly. We redesigned the primers to anneal to the E. coli SoxS, OxyS, KatG and HemH promoters.
14 April 2011
OxyR team came in on reading day and purified the plasmid with the GFP insert since we forgot to add ampicillin to the overnight culture last time. We boiled some E. coli to use as template for colony PCR to check the binding domain.

Devin Sabin
Devin experimenting with all-natural, hole-less earrings
Devin is a Senior majoring in Microbiology. As a sophomore, he isolated the novel micobacteriophage Sabinator through HHMI's Phagehunter program.  He then started working in Dr. Robison's Pathogenesis lab with a new antibiotic and MRSA. Last winter, he took a break from classes to work as an intern for BD Diagnostics out in Baltimore, Maryland. Eventually he plans on going to graduate school to earn a PhD in Pathology. His love of working with his hands has combined with his interest in biology to fuel his desire to pursue a career in laboratory research.
In his spare time, Devin enjoys riding four-wheelers, playing ultimate frisbee and has a knack for finding free stuff.

Mackay set up PCR to re-amplify OxyR-medium. Left note for Rob to run on gel when he came in next. Matt elaborated on the previous to-do list from July 28th:
List of plasmids and into which strains they go for electroporation:
SoxRW (pIG24) into SoxR-
SoxRM(pIG25) into SoxR-
SoxRS(pIG26) into SoxR-
HemH/OxyRW (pIG22) into OxyR-
HemH/OxyRS (pIG23) into OxyR-
KatG/OxyRW (pIG19) into OxyR-
KatG/OxyRS (pIG20) into OxyR-
Plan plate reader protocol
Move (in database) IGM22-26 to plasmid section and rename to pIG22-26. Improve descriptions.
2 August 2011
Matt did electroporations with Dr. Grose using the newly-ordered SoxR- and OxyR- strains.
Diligent Julie, writing in the notebook.
3 August 2011
Matt made more to-do lists for mundane lab tasks such as making LB-amp plates, and stating the obvious such as ""try ligations such-and-such over again"". He also noted that from the previous day's electroporation attempt, all but two (IGM22 and 27) worked and gave colonies, though only IGM23's colonies turned green.
5 August 2011
Matt and Rob were up very early and in the lab by 7:00 am to perform the plate-reader experiment with the newly constructed plasmids, in their newly electroporated strains. Their hands were tired from so much pipetting, but they did manage to finish around 1:00 pm with some data in hand:
Plate Reader Experiment Results
The sharp, green peak caught our interest. Since we hadn't done the experiment in duplicate even, the data point that caused the sharp contrast could have been an outlier, but we were excited nonetheless.

Set up Transformations for 51-6 (mutation 11), 51-7 (griff med) , 53-6 (griff short) and the purified plasmids TSA, I, and J.
Aug. 23
Mutagenic PCR – In order to get a wide range of different thermosensors we will be using a low fidelity PCR technique.  Our template DNA will be from the purified plasmid TSA which contains a thermosensor designed to be similar a thermosensor found in listeria monocytogenes.  As the PCR is carried out random nucleotides will be placed causing many different mutations of the TSA thermosensor. We will be using protocol similar to that found in the paper “Generation of synthetic RNA-based thermosensors” (T. Waldminghaus et. al.)
First created a  CT/GA stock
10mM CT (20 uL) --> same for GA
2uL C 100mM
2uL T 100mM
16uL ddH2O
20 uL total  = 10mM C/T
2mM CT         --> same for GA
1uL 10mM C/T
4 uL ddH2O
5 uL C/T 2mM stock
Dilute MnCl2 10mM --> 5mM
40uL total
20uL MnCl2
20uL ddH2O
55-1 Master mix
108uL ddH2O
20uL  pol. buffer
15uL C/T (10mM)
5uL G/A (2mM)
15uL primer IG54
15uL primer IG47
2uL Taq polymerase
20uL 5mM MnCl2
40uL of master mix in tubes 1-4
Added 1.5uL purified plasmid TSA to each PCR tube
55-2 Master Mix
108uL ddH2O
20uL pol. buffer
15uL GA 10mM stock
5uL CT 2mM stock
15uL primer IG54
15uL primer IG47
2uL Taq polymerase
20uL 5mM MnCl2
40uL of master mix in tubes 5-8
Added 1.5 uL purified plasmid TSA to each PCR tube
Ran PCR according to GB1 mutagenesis protocol
24 August 2011
Plated to plates from plates TSA, I and J to test for thermosensor activity.  One plate incubated at 30’C overnight and the other at 37’C.
Results: All 3 have more LacZ expression at 37o . TSI has very minimal LacZ expression at 30o and J and A are mostly white.
Ran gel on mutagenic PCR 55-1 and 55-2.

Upon closer examination of the data, Dr. Grose felt like that massive peak was due to cell death (dividing by an extremely small OD gave a really tall peak). She recommended cleaning up our protocol a bit, and using our low-copy plasmid from the iGEM library of parts.  Rob set up some overnight cultures and placed them on the shaker in the incubator room.

Sequencing results back
pIG 15-IG40 (396bp)--aligned with lacZ from pcDNA3_lv5hislacz_seq
score 250 bits
identities 164/188 (87%)
Strand plus/plus
E=4.8e^-70
pIG16-IG40 (640bp)--aligned with lacZ from pcDNA3_lv5hislacz_seq
Score 1029 bits
E=0
pIG17-IG12 (963bp)--aligned with sfGFP sequence from Dr. Bundy
No significant match
pIG 15 and pIG16 have inserted correctly! We can go ahead and move forward with those!
pIG17 & most likely pIG18 don’t have GFP
-Mark
7/19/11
Boiled template for LacZ∆TS (setting up to check for thermosensor insertion)
selected 8 colonies, diluted in 50microliters ddH20, then streaked on 8-slice plate (41-1). Also streaked for GFP∆TS (41-2)
-Julie
7/20/11
Standard Taq PCR set up as colony PCR for 8 colonies from plates 41-1 and 42-1.
Plate 41-1 colony PCR only because 41-2 colony PCR got “royally messed up” Not certain of the accuracy.
7/21/11
Remade boiled template so we can redo colony PCR if needed
T41-1 boiled template M
T41-2 boiled template M
Ran Gel on previously set up colony PCR--there are two bands, one looks like possible thermosensor, the other is unknown
Made XGAL/ARA/AMP plates:
10g bacto-tryptone
5g yeast
5g NaCl
5g Agar
.1g Arabinose
1ml Amp
1ml X-Gal
7 July 2011
Made LB/amp/ara/x-gal plates, put in fridge. Be CAEFUL: one bag has unlabeled plates. Label once dry.

Matt and Rob came in and set up colony PCR to check the OxyR-Med ligations. Rob was the master of boiling/patching colonies.
19 July 2011
PCR results from July 18th:
20 July 2011
Purified plasmids from the most recent round of transformations (using the colonies that passed the colony PCR test).
21 July 2011
Performed another ligation trying the katG promoter again.
22 July 2011
Plates that Matt started (the ligation from July 21st) were only pinpricks in the morning. Rob allowed them to grow a bit longer.
23 July 2011
Mackay set up a colony PCR checking the KatG/OxyR-Medium construct again (the one that hadn't been working).

Week 11 (June 26 - Jul 2)
6/27/11
It looks like 33-1 worked, but I don’t know if lacZ and GFP were actually inserted
Doesn’t look like lacZ did, but GFP looks promising.
6/28/11
PCR purfication of 33-1 (lacZ PCR)
Qiaquick PCR purification kit protocol -Julie
lacZ restricition digest (TRD 34-1)
T33-1 PCR up/lacZ with 1 ul of HindIII and XbaI each
pPLAT-Bad restriciton digest (TRD 34-2)
pIG 13 with 1 ul each of HindIII and XbaI
Ran a low melt. Cut out pPLAT-Bad and stuck in 1.5 centrifuge tube. Could not see lacZ band...->doesn’t matter, I used wrong lacZ reverse
We could run another low melt and we may want to PCR it again. Other half of low melt in fridge.
lacZ PCR (35-1)
Phusion polymerase and 1 ul each of IG40 and IG41 primers with pIGGY template
Making two in case there is another purification problem or something
35-2: PCR up of lacZ according to qiaquick instructions
6/30/11
Running gel on lacZ PCR products
Both lanes look good. Now onto restriction digest.
RD lacZ (35-3)
1-2 ul each restricition enzyme (HindIII and XbaI)
35-4 Ran low melt and cut out lacZ band. Very faint, but there!
lacZ/pPlatbad ligation 36-1
T4 ligase, 3 ul vector, 3 ul lacZ (added a little extra b/c faintness of band)
7/1/11
lacZ/pPlatbad transformation
Followed Grose protocol
Plated 100 ul on LB-amp and incubated overnight
Labeled T36-1 lacZ trans 1 July 2011 - Devin

Sequenced pLATBAD at the sequencing center and it reconfirmed that our pBAD was not successfully inserted into pLAT, next step: digest pBAD and pLAT for insertion and transformation.
Performed Restricition digest of pBAD and pLAT at PstI and BamHI on the vector and BglII site on the pBAD insert. (pBAD had a BamHI site in the gene so we couldn’t digest it with BamHI)
Placed digests in the 370C block in Dr. Grose’s lab
Dr. Grose would like us to see her for ALL protocol regarding this ligation, it needs to go right.

Thermosensor Test
Plates T61-11 through T61-29 (except plate T61-19, the plate that was originally put at 37C) moved from 30C to the 37C incubator at 8:00am. Marked all blue colonies with an “x” so that we can distinguish those that were initially blue from those which change expression of LacZ (thermosensor activitiy) and go from white to blue. Used plate T61-19 which had been placed at 37C and had variation in LacZ expression to define what we would call blue once changed. When initially transferred, some Plates were more than 50% blue at 30C We went through hourly and marked colonies that turned blue with the respective hour in which they were checked and appeared blue.
September 9
Dr. Grose, and ourselves for that matter, are very excited about how this experiment and how varied these colonies turned out to be. Next we need to streak the colonies that changed after the experiment (any of the colonies labeled with a number). We will put these at 30C and then watch them at 37C to ensure that they actually do change about the same time again. Those colonies that are still lighter in blue color we will transfer to 42C and observe their change in color, hopefully a dark blue. We also need the wild-type Thermosensor A  as a reference on multiple plates. We need to keep track again at what hour they all changed.

25 July 2011
Matt set up overnight cultures of the strains (IGM13-21) to be used in the plate reader experiment on July 26th.  Sat down with Mackay later and they decided that they didn't know which concentrations of Hydrogen Peroxide they would want to use to activate the  OxyR promoters. After talking more, they realized they hadn't discussed a protocol yet with Dr. Grose, so they jotted down questions and went down to ask her. The resulting protocol was the precursor to the ""Plate Reader Experiment"" Protocol as now described. Some important points nailed down on July 25th: 1. In analyzing our data, we need to normalize with respect to OD. 2.The lethal concentration of H2O2 is above 1 mM.  3. The maximum oxyR-regulated response to H2O2 in a similar biosensor system is around 1 mM.
28 July 2011
Rob - ran colony PCR gel from 23 July.
Gel Printout
Matt determined a to-do list for the next few days:
Make more LB
Re-amplify OxyR-Medium fragment
Electroporate the plasmids with OxyR Weak, Medium, and Strong fragments into SoxR- and OxyR- strains.
Do Plate-reader experiment (using higher doses of H2O2 and measuring OD's)

Big thanks to all of the supervisors for watching over us and guiding us through the project. Thanks also to David Simmons, Georgia Kafer and their lab for hosting us.
Thanks also go to the staff of the School of Biomedical Sciences for hosting us and providing a fun and safe environment for us.
It should be known that although the team supervisors helped us learn the necessary laboratory skills and practices to be used in this project, all experiments and other work related to the iGEM project (including fundraising, outreach, safety analysis and modelling) were conducted by the students of the UQ Australia team.
We would also like to thank the following people for their contributions during our project:
Dr. Susan Rowland from School of Chemistry and Molecular Biosciences , The University of Queensland , for sharing her bacterial expertise with us and guiding us with the project. We are also indebted to her for providing us with plasmid vectors pET16.1 and pBAD containing lacI and araC.

The 2011 iGEM team from the University of Queensland consists of six undergraduates based at the School of Biomedical Sciences. We worked mainly in the Thomas and Simmons labs.
Our team comes from a diverse range of fields, including Biotechnology, Biomedical Science and Physics. We are all third year students with differing levels of laboratory experience who wanted to expand our skills and explore the exciting new field of synthetic biology! UQ has only participated in iGEM once before, so the team and our supervisors were all learning as we went along. Nevertheless, we feel like we accomplished a lot this year and hope that future UQ teams will be able to continue our work.

In 2009, Hao Jiang, Li Xing, Hao Wu, Zongxiao He, Danqian Liu, Chao Li, Jiayi Dou, Hanyu Lu, Hao Zhou and Bing Wu, guided by Zhaofeng Luo, Jian Zhan, Jiong Hong and Xiaoxiao Ma, won a Gold Medal, with the project ""E. coli Automatic Directed Evolution Machine (E.ADEM)"" .
In 2009 we also formed a software team for the first time. Wei Pan, Yuwei Cui, Jiahao Li, Yu He and Xiaomo Yao, guided by Bo Ding, also won a Gold Medal, with the Project ""Automatic Biological Circuit Design (ABCD)"" .
Since we have accumulated some experience from the project of Automatic Biological Circuit Design (ABCD), we developed a synthetic biology game in 2010 called iGaME . The game aims at teaching non-biologists how to design biological systems so that players can compete to improve their designs in order to help biologists create the best engineered machines.

Hi, I'm Xudong Sun, a graduate student majoring in nano biophysics. All the wonders and mysteries in life sciences attract so I have changed my career from physics to biology.  Currently , my research field is nanobio detection and manipulation with SPM, MD simulation of biological systems.
My interests range from modelling and simulation, signal and image processing,coding,and electronic engineering. In my spare time, i am involved in all kinds of sports and interesting activities,all kinds of balls, swimming, dancing ,hiking and many more.
I like chatting with people and arranging things. I have learned much from the experence in iGEM of cooperating with people from different backgrounds. As the team leader,my major task in this project is  arranging the team affairs , investigating the fields we can do, writing the test codes of parameter analysis, discussing models and algorithms with other teammates and providing necessary biology background.
I hope everyone involved in iGEM can have fun, make more friends, learn more and enjoy yourself.

I am Ao Xu !   :)
I am a junior student majored in theory and applied mechanics.
As the boundaries among different disciplines of science are now blurring,             I want to handle the ideology of engineering to arrive at a higher standpoint to try to understand the principle of life.            iGEM, a Do-It-Yourself Genetic Engineering Program, provides us with such a good state to learn from utilization,            and I am strongly attracted by this idea and cannot help imaging the science fiction picture where our daily life is changed by our genetic machine.
In our team, I mainly design and construct our website, responsible for human practice, together with raise ideas about User Interface, summarize useful information from previous work.

Hi, I am Qi Wang, a graduate student majored in biostatistics and machine learning.
Being a  member of the team of USTC-software has always been an enjoyable time for me.  The DNA data I deal with in my daily research which used to be lifeless had  become vivid after learning the background knowledge from iGEM, and I have  learnt many useful programming tricks working with my team members.
In my team, I mainly work on the  statistical model to simulate biological reactions, and find the most sensitive  direction of the parameters of the systems of ordinary differential equations which describe  the dynamic state of the biochemistry system in the hyperspace.
In my  spare time, I like watching movie, my favorite film maker is Tim Burton.

Human Practice
Last year, as Human Practice activity, we, five Japanese teams, sent out questionnaires to know how people think about biotechnology. (For more detailed information, please click here. From its result, we know that the public has little information on synthetic biology and gene recombination technology. (Fig1,2)
Fig1.Q-When shopping, do you buy ""not genetically modified food”?-  Avoidance index is an average when Always buy is 4 points, Tend to buy is 3 points, Hardly mind is 2points, and Not mind is 1point.
Fig2.Q-Have you ever heard the word, ""Synthetic biology""?- This is comparison between college student and the other.
The following were done to improve this situation.
Participating in
Science Agora
Science Agora , held at Tokyo Academic Park in November every year, is the largest science communication event in Japan. Participants are kids and parents, students, companies, researchers and so on.
We took part in it with two other Japanese teams last year after the end of 2010 iGEM competition. In this big meeting, we exhibited posters that we used in World Jamboree and gave an account of iGEM and our project to not only specialists but also the public by using new posters. This was also good chance to explain synthetic biology to the public.
Bio EXPO/ nano Bio EXPO
These are the Asia’s largest drug discovery and life science event. We visited booths of companies and explained iGEM and our works.
Official site: Bio EXPO / nano Bio EXPO
the alumni of TMU
We told about iGEM to alumni and alumnae of TMU (Tokyo Metropolitan University) and exhibited posters. Many people from not only the Biology Department but also other Departments were interested in our activity.
""Open Campus"" of TMU
In Japan, “Open Campus” means the college’s open day for high school students (usually in July or August). At this event, we exhibited posters and explained what is iGEM, gene recombination technology and our project to high school students. (The result shows, high school students tend to receive gene recombination technology “friendly”.) Some of them were enthusiastic about iGEM activity.
Science education for children
As a teacher, we participated in special “science-class” which was held by Leave a Nest, a company promoting biology education. In this class, elementary school students and junior high school students did experiments selected for science education for children (i.e. easy to understand and fun).
We charged ourselves with giving a lecture on synthetic biology and prepared for an easy experiment, through which children can understand everything, including DNA, is made of atoms and molecules. After that, we gave brief explanation of synthetic biology.    Official site is here (only Japanese page).
Opening meetings with other groups
There are many other groups beside our iGEM group, for example, “Formula Racing Team”, “Converted EV”. We have opened meetings regularly to exchange ideas with these teams. These meetings are good opportunities to explain iGEM and our teams to students from other fields (mechanical, electrical engineering, for instance).
2011 JAPAN Meetup
We participated Japan meetup three times, in Tokyo University, Kyoto University, and Tokyo Metroporitan University that we hosted. The details is here . We exchanged our own views and deepened our own visions. It is dependable that we could extend our knowledge and utilize each project.

What we did...
Edoardo Baldini has been the wiki-master. He took care of the wiki design and layout very meticulously. Despite being an electronic engineer, he also learnt and carried out all the wet lab protocols, cloning parts with success and performing Tecan tests. During the brainstorming sessions of March and April he proposed a couple of interesting ideas. Finally he worked on our terrific sweaters!
Giuseppe Bertoni has been fundamental during the brainstorming sessions, thanks to his enormous knowledge and passion in biology and biotechnology. He also worked on cloning BioBrick parts and on the design and performing of Tecan experiments. He also worked on the wiki, designing our fantastic logo.
Davide Bianchini has been working hard on the model, deriving its equations and designing the Tecan tests for the parameter estimation. His work on the stability analysis was also very important; moreover he also helped in the wet lab, working on the cloning of BioBrick parts and their transferring in pSB1C3 shipping plasmid.
Niccolò Franceschi has worked hard in the wet lab, both on the cloning and the testing of our BioBrick parts, verifying, together with Viola that all of our parts were correct. He also analyzed the scientific literature and actively worked on resuming the results of our tests. Least but not last, was fundamental in raising funds for our project.
Viola Ghio worked hard in the wet lab. She cloned parts, performed screening on them and also verified that their sequences were correct. Moreover she worked on the transferring of selected BioBrick parts in pSB1C3 shipping vector. She actively took part in wiki editing and also took photographs for the Gallery and Team pages.
Tommaso Goggia, one of the biomedical engineers of our group, worked very hard on all the activities, learning to perform all the wet lab protocols, designing and performing Tecan tests. Together with Davide he derived the model equations and carried out a precise data analysis for the quantitative characterization of our BioBrick parts and the identification of mathematical model parameters.
Emanuela Pasi gave contribution in the wet lab, following all the Tecan tests and the BioBrick parts cloning. She was also involved in the analysis of the scientific literature connected with our project; freezer management was also one of her works. Finally she played an important role in the design of our poster and presentations.
Daniele Sartori was the chemist specialist of the group, who worked on all the wet lab activities; he helped us understanding the behavior of HSL at different pHs. His support in cloning and transferring BioBrick parts in pSB1C3 was fundamental; he also designed the poster and the presentation together with Emanuela and decided which results to put in it.
Nicolò Politi planned and coordinated all the student and advisor activities in both wetlab and drylab and trained the students for the cloning and quantitative experiments. Instructor for the rest of the team about promoter measurement, modeling and data analysis.
Federica Sampietro coordinated all the wet lab work. She played an important role in cloning all the parts and characterizing them, as she worked also on the data analysis and quantitative characterization. During the brainstorming meetings she analyzed all the ideas and collected a lot of information on the previous iGEM editions projects. She also took care of the freezer management together with Emanuela.
Susanna Zucca coordinated the team during the brainstorming sessions, project discussions and during the submission and documentation of BioBrick parts to the Registry.  Instructor for the rest of the team about physical and functional standardization in synthetic biology.
Maria Gabriella Cusella is the leader of the wetlab in which the students worked during the summer. She organized the spaces, the instruments and the lab funds dedicated to the   iGEM project.
Paolo Magni coordinated all the project activities: meetings, project timeline, fundraising, contacts with media and institutions. Registry, wiki, poster and presentation   supervisor (with the other advisors). He also performed the selection of the team students and he participated (with the other adivsors) to the selection and the definition of the project   and to all the discussions about its problems and issues.
All team members contributed equally to brainstorming sessions,

Attributions and Contributions
Computational team
We developed five software applications and deployed most of them in the wet lab. While this was a team effort, we point out key contributors to each of the five applications below:
G-nome Surfer Pro and  E-Lab Notebook
Both of these applications were conceived, designed, and implemented by the Human Computer Interaction Laboratory (HCI) at Wellesley College. Michael Lintz, Heidi Wang, Taili Feng, Casey Grote, and Megan Strait contributed to the design and implementation of the G-nome Surfer Pro application, whereas Kathy Liu, Michelle Ferreirae, Consuelo Valdes, and Kelsey Tempel contributed to the design of the E-Lab Notebook application.
Optimus Primer
This application was conceived by Traci Haddock (instructor) and designed and implemented by Jenhan Tao. In parallel, a Microsoft Surface version was also developed by Kelsey Tempel, Casey Grote, and Consuelo Valdes of Wellesley College's HCI Lab.
Trumpet
This application was conceived by Swapnil Bhatia (instructor) and designed and implemented by Craig LaBoda. The application implements two design algorithms, one of which was derived by Craig LaBoda and the other by Swapnil Bhatia. In parallel, a Microsoft Surface version was also designed by Michael Lintz, Michelle Ferreirae, and Alex Pan of Wellesley College's HCI Lab.
PuppetShow, and the Puppeteer Protocol Automation Stack
The Puppeteer Protocol Automation stack was conceived and designed by Swapnil Bhatia and graduate student Viktor Vasilev. The PuppetShow application was designed and implemented by Janoo Fernandes. Resource Management in the Puppeteer stack was implemented by Chenkai Liu. Python glue code was provided by Viktor Vasilev, and a Hardware Abstraction Layer implementation was provided by Viktor Vasilev and Aaron Adler (BBN Technologies).
The Clotho Fabdash skin
The new Fabdash skin for Clotho was originally conceived by Professor Anderson of UC Berkeley.  The interface was developed and refined by Jenhan Tao. The current interface is a distinct departure from the original Clotho interface, and offers a more streamlined experience.
The iGEM Team Wiki
The iGEM Team Wiki was designed and implemented by Taili Feng, Consuelo Valdes, and Heidi Wang. The content was provided by the entire team.
Wet lab team
The wet lab team helped the computational team design, implement, deploy, and test their applications.
PuppetShow, and the Puppeteer Protocol Automation Stack
The Puppeteer Protocol Automation Stack was tested in the wet lab on the Tecan Evo 150 robot with the help of Evelyn Orozco, who helped construct several genetic circuits and executed manual controls for each robotic assembly.
Clotho
All DNA samples used over the course of the summer were put into Clotho through the Batterboard Clotho application and through the Spreadit series of Clotho applications, by Vanessa Yanez and Margaux Canevari. Vanessa used Batterboard to input all of the physical DNA samples from the wet lab while Margaux used Spreadit Parts, Spreadit Features, and Spreadit Vectors to input the BioBrick names and DNA sequences attached to those samples. Kyle Jones and Alberto Purwada also met with Rishi Ganguly (graduate student), to give feedback to improve the user interface for Batterboard.
Outreach
The Genekai plan was conceived by the entire team during a group discussion and implemented by Chenkai Liu and Shannon Harrington.
The Wellesley HCI Lab mentored 2 rising seniors in High School and presented in the Wellesley College Science Center Summer Poster Session.
Lab organization
Kyle Jones and Alberto Purwada were the major contributors to the physical organization of various types of samples in the lab including plasmid DNA, gel extractions, ligations, and frozen glycerol stocks. Kyle also designed a spreadsheet for keeping track of samples, which was updated weekly by a different wet lab team member each week during the summer.
Optimus Primer
To study various TB transcription factors and their promoters, primers were designed to generate BioBricks of those parts by Kyle Jones, with Suma Jaini overseeing this process.
E-Lab Notebook
All six wet lab team members participated in multiple discussions on the desired tools and layout designs of the e-notebook as implemented by the HCI lab.
Part construction
The wet lab built new parts comprising various fluorescent proteins and promoters to generate a library of reporter circuits. Each member of the wet lab team contributed to this work under the guidance of Traci Haddock (instructor).

John is interested in anything computational and related to molecules. After a PhD in theoretical chemistry, his first postdoc was in Biochemistry at UCL. He has been a lecturer at Birkbeck and at Cambridge, before coming to St Andrews in 2009. Since then, he has done lots of chemoinformatics, quite a lot of bioinformatics and only a little real theoretical chemistry. His scientific interests include computing the binding affinities between proteins and ligands, side-effects and toxicities of pharmaceuticals, and how much of a compound will dissolve in water. His group have worked extensively on the prediction of molecular properties such as melting point and solubility from chemical structure. They also use computational methods to study enzyme reaction mechanisms. They continue to develop the MACiE database of enzyme reaction mechanisms in collaboration with Prof. Janet Thornton at the EMBL-EBI.
Dr. Morven Shearer
School of Medicine
Morven is particularly interested in the Human Practices aspect of the iGEM project. She has a background in pharmacology and neuroscience and is currently an Academic Fellow in Public Health Policy in the School of Medicine where she oversees the teaching programme in medical ethics.

Munich
Munich and its…
… facts
>
Munich (lat: apud Munichen- by the monks) is the capital of Bavaria, a state in the southeast of Germany. With 1.35 Mio inhabitants it’s the biggest town in Bavaria and the 3rd biggest in Germany. More than 2.6 Mio people live in the area of Munich. It is situated in the beautiful foothills of the Alps, which can be seen even from Munich. The river Isar runs through Munich, generating lots of nice spots alongside the river for sports or chilling like the English Garden. A lot of smaller rivers are branched of the Isar and run through the city, like the Eisbach, which is famous for its surfers.
… history
Munich was first mentioned in 1158 and belonged to the diocese Freising. In 1240 it came in hold of the Wittelsbach-family and 1314 it became residence of the king. In 1506 it became the capital of whole Bavaria. But only 300 years later under King Ludwig I and Max II Munich started to rise. It’s wellknown parts like the Königsplatz, the Residence, the Maximilianstraße were built. Munichs dark chapter started with the Hitlerputsch in 1923. After the second world war Munich became a high tech site.
>
… sights
Just to mention a few: the Marienplatz in the middle of Munich, with the town hall and its “Glockenspiel”, the Viktualienmarkt, the Olympiastadion and the surrounding area, the town gates (Isartor, Sendlinger Tor), the University, where the “weiße Rose” handed out their leaflets during the second world war, Nymphenburg Castle, the Museums of Art, a lot of churches, Feldherrnhalle, Maximiliansstraße, …
… arts
A lot of german writers lived in Munich,e.g. Heinrich Heine, Berthold Brecht, Thomas Mann and many more. There is a lot to see in theater, concerts, opera or ballet.
… its food and beer
The “Weißwurst” was made for the first time in Munich in 1857 and is one of THE Bavarian specialties, next to “leberkassemmel”, “Brezn” and the Munich beer. The most spectacular place to enjoy your beer is definitively on the octoberfest, which is a synonym for Bavaria and Munich all over the world. It takes part once a year at the end of September and attracts millions of people from all over the world. We guess you have heard about..
… its universities
There are two main universities in Munich, the Ludwig-Maximilians University and the Technical University of Munich. Besides these, there are some smaller universities where you can specialise in arts, theater, musics or politics for exampple. Besides the universities there are several non-profit research institutes in Munich. Most relevant in our field of studies are the famous Max Planck Gesellschaft, some Frauenhofer instituts and the Helmholtz centres.
TU Munich
The TU München, short TUM, is one of the two universities of Munich. Here you can study all kinds of technic-related subjects, ranging from Engineering over Medicine to Natural Sciences. Currently there are around 26.000 people studying at the TUM, whereof 2/3 are male and 1/3 is female (of course… women and technology :)). The history of the university dates way back in the 19th century and developed out of different organizations which also resulted in the spreading of the different departments.
The university does not have one big campus but is split up in several smaller locations where the main ones are
Main campus in downtown Munich
Garching: Mathematics, Computer Science, Physics, Chemistry, Mechanical Engineering, neutron source; on the same campus, there are also several other research institutes
Weihenstephan: Center for Life and Food Science
Hospital: ”Klinikum Rechts der Isar” (Medicine) in Munich
What makes the TU Munich special?
It’s so far the only technical university of Bavaria.
It has five different locations spread all over Munich/Bavaria which makes studying in an interdisciplinary research field like biochemistry or molecular biology a difficult task because you have to travel to a lot of different places. Especially when taking the regional tram- and underground system it can take hours to get from one place to another.
16 Nobel Prize Winners mainly in Chemistry and Physics studied and/or did their research at the TUM.
Only university in the whole world with its own brewery.

The 2010 Team
The last years team aim was to develop an arbitrarily extendable system, that assembles biological components to an in vivo network and thereby allows logical information processing.
By developing a biological network that is constructed in a similar manner as a personal computer, they wanted to provide Science with the feasibility to program cells and build logical networks based on AND/OR/NOT between Biobricks. This would allow functional connections between Biobricks and would give them a stronger brick characteristic.
To realise this they engineered simple and easy-to-handle switches based on predictable RNA/RNA-interactions regulating transcriptional termination. These switches represent a complete set of logical functions and are capable of forming arbitrarily complex networks.
They won a Gold Medal in iGEM 2010

Welcome to E.XPRESS3D
This year we aim to develop a light-controlled 3D-printer by innovative utilization of optogenetics. As a first step, we want to develop a genetic logical AND-gate sensitive to light of two different wavelengths (e.g. blue and red light). The bacteria are then immobilized in a transparent gel matrix, where they can be precisely actuated when hit by both blue and red light at the same time. If both of these inputs are positive, gene expression is induced. Various different gene products can be expressed using this system.
If you want to learn more about our project, the modeling, our human practice projects or the team, click on the pictures below.

Safety
1. Would any of your project ideas raise safety issues concerning researchers, the public or the environment?
The project ideas of the TU Munich Team 2011 do not raise any more safety issues than those which have to be considered in every biotechnological work involving genetics and microbiology.
All team members had to participate in a safety briefing, where we learned handling biological material, aspects on chemicals and the circumstances and protocols at the lab we work in (these may differ from institute to institute). Even though most of us have worked in laboratories before, there are some aspects you need to be reminded of when starting to work in a lab. The researcher should wear a labcoat, safety glasses and gloves and one must not drink, eat or smoke whilst working at the bench. The safety degree of the worn protection should depend on the chemicals and microorganisms handled. The most important part, however, is that everybody should always be aware of what he is doing, with what kind of biological parts and chemicals he is working and how to handle them safely.
The lab we work in is classified as BSL 1 (biosafety level 1), according to the European Union Directive 2000/54/EG and the German ""Gesetz zur Regelung der Gentechnik (GenTG)"" ( law for the regulation of genetic engineering , text in German only). There is a total of four Biosafety levels, with BSL 1 being the lowest and BSL 4 being the highest.
Work inside a BSL 1 lab, such as ours, involves no devices that are potentially harmful to the researchers if they act corresponding to the general precautionary measures. Especially, no pathogenic organisms are used, as the bacterial strains in our lab do not possess mechanisms necessary for survival outside of the lab, or in the human body. However, even in a BSL 1 lab materials are used, which can be harmful to researchers, the public or the environment.
BSL 2 and 3 laboratories are necessary to work with biohazardous material that can cause disease (BSL 3 in case of potential severe disease) for which an effective cure is available. The security measures of these labs include security work benches and an air filter system, for example.
BSL 4 laboratories are required to work with organisms capable of causing severe disease and for which effective treatment is not possible (such as smallpox or the Ebola virus). A BSL 4 lab has to have a broad range of safety measures. To give some examples there have to be hazmat suits, airlocks to maintain a low air pressure inside the lab, and many methods of decontamination to ensure that no traces of biohazardous material can get out of the lab, or harm its researchers.
2. Would the materials used in your project and/or your final product pose:
Risks to the safety and health of team members or others in the lab?
Risks to the safety and health of the general public if released by design or accident?
Risks to environmental quality if released by design or accident?
Risks to security through malicious misuse by individuals, groups or states?
There are dangerous substances used in our lab. The following list features a few important examples:
In every laboratory of molecular biology, specific chemicals are required for staining of DNA, in order to make it visible on Agarose gels. Most of them directly intercalate into the double strand of DNA, which makes them cancerogenic. A commonly used, but rather dangerous substance is ethidium bromide. In our lab, we use SYBR® Gold. It is less hazardous than ethidium bromide, but can still be cancerogenic if it comes into direct contact with human skin. Protective gloves should be made from nitrile rubber and changed frequently to prevent contamination with SYBR® Gold. All gels and materials that came into contact with SYBR® Gold need to be disposed of seperately. This is done in order to prevent their unintended leakage into the environment, with subsequent harm to humans, animals and plants.
Methods of molecular biology often require strong acids or bases, like sulfuric acid, or toxic substances such as methanol. They need to be handled with extreme caution and also need to be seperately disposed.
Many devices in the lab can be potentially dangerous towards researchers, if they are used carelessly or in the wrong way. There are lamps emitting ultraviolet radiation, which can be cancerogenic.
If all these measures are taken, the potential danger for researchers, other people and the environment can be reduced to a minimum.
There are several different bacterial strains used in our lab for transformation of BioBrick parts, which have been manipulated in some way to make sure that they are harmless. The strains used in our lab, like the heat-resistent Escherichia coli strain BH28, are derived from E. coli K-12. K-12 is a safety strain, as the bacteria carry several auxotrophies. This means that they are dependent on certain sources of carbon, amino acids and other nutritients. Without them, growth is not or only in a restricted way possible. BH28 is derived from K-12, but has over 260 mutations, which lead to its heat resistance. The other E. coli strains DH5 alpha, BL21 and CP919 that were used in the lab, are also derived from K-12.
If despite all precautions humans are infected with bacteria, the first weapon of choice are always antibiotics. They specifically kill bacteria, while keeping side effects for the patient to a minimum. Bacteria can be resistant against antibiotics. The genes responsible for this are often used as selection markers during cloning. With respect to killing them however, antibiotic resistences can make bacteria more dangerous. The number of supplied resistences should therefore be reduced to no more than necessary.
The bacteria are not motil and auxotroph, so they cannot survive in minimal medium (with only glucose as C source), but need additional aminoacids to survive. Since nothing from the lab is taken into public and stays inside there should be no safety issues considering public or environmental safety. Furthermore, used E. coli cultures and waste containing biologic material is autoclaved at 121 °C before being thrown away. This ensures that no genetically modified material can reach the outside of the lab. Our final construct itself, the optogenetical AND-Gate, is not associated with pathogenicity, infectivity or toxicity. Furthermore, it has no impact on environmental quality, as it is not able to compete to its natural competitors, due to its auxotrophies. All in all this leads to secure strains which cannot survive outside the laboratory.
A deliberate misuse of this construct is unplausible, as it does not increase pathogenicity of the E. coli strain. Scenarios, in which our construct is used to specifically trigger the production of toxins or other substances to harm humans, animals, or the environment in general are unlikely, as the strains used are not able to survive outside from controlled conditions. Even the use of efficient strains would not be able to promote misuse, e.g. as a biological weapon, because the optogenetical AND-Gate does not feature necessary factors of pathogenicity. This also applies for all intermediate constructs.
3. Do any of the new BioBrick parts (or devices) that you made this year raise any safety issues?
None of our BioBrick parts are potentially harmful to humans or the environment. The function of the optogenetic AND-Gate is to control the expression of a protein by light. The used reporter plasmids express β-galactosidase or GFP and both do not pose a threat to humans, animals or the environment.
4. Is there a local biosafety group, committee, or review board at your institution?
Every department at TU Munich needs a safety delegate. In our case this is Guenther Woehlke. In a direct talk, he did not mention any concerns about the project regarding safety issues. Also, Helene Budjarek, the supervisor of safety in the lab, sees no possible risks caused by our project.
We do not have an Institutional Biosafety Committee. All checks concerning safety in laboratories are taken care of by state officials. In general, working with genetically modified organisms in Germany is regulated by the ""Gesetz zur Regelung der Gentechnik (GenTG)"" (law for the regulation of gentetic engineering, see above).
Before starting work in a lab, every participient has to get a safety instruction and an instruction in the lab, which were both obligatory. Our supervisor of safety, Helene Budjarek, made us familiar with the lab and explained the safety rules when handling with dangerous biological or chemical substances (e.g. SYBR® Gold) or devices. She also showed us how to properly act in an emergency and where to find help, like showers or fire extinguishers. Fore more information, also refer to section 1 above.
5. Do you have any other ideas how to deal with safety issues that could be useful for future iGEM competitions? How could parts, devices and systems be made even safer through biosafety engineering?
There are several ways to increase safety when working with BioBrick parts. The easiest way is to protocol and supervise all actions, parts and bacterial strains during the creation of new, or the improvement of existing BioBricks. By denying unauthorised people access, misuse can be prevented. Furthermore, the bacteria need to be kept dependent on controlled conditions in the lab, in order to prohibit their uncontrolled spreading outside the lab. The uncontrolled multiplication and spreading of parts must also be avoided. This can be achieved by application of uncommon restriction enzymes and by using no parts containing infectious DNA in combination with parts that can multiply and spread without the help of a host organism, like transposons.

E14 Biomolecular Systems and Bionanotechnology:
The chair of bioelectronics is located at the Walter Schottky Institute - center for nanotechnology and nanomaterials of the Technische Universität München (University of Technology, Munich). The research goal is the realization of self-organizing molecular systems that are able to respond to their environment, compute, move, take action. On the long term, they envision autonomous systems that are reconfigurable, that can learn, evolve or develop.
Current reserch highlights:
Biomolecular nanodevices
DNA and RNA molecules can turn into many different structures such as double- stranded molecules made of complementary DNA molecules or self- complementary sequences which form hairpin loops for example. Molecular structures may be designed to switch reversibly between different structures, which may have  particular functions. They might be used as mechanical actuators, motors, sensors or computational elements.
Biochemical circuits
DNA hybridization, enzymatic catalysis or other biochemical processes can be used to simulate biomolecular analogues of electronic logic circuits and signal processing. The production or release of certain biomolecules can be made dependent on the evaluation of “diagnostic” computational rules. These artificial biochemical circuits offer great chances for the development of advanced biosensors as well as the re-programming of biological systems.
DNA self-assembly
DNA with its biophysical and –chemical properties can be used to construct and the assimilation of artificial biomolecular nanostructures. The close relation between the DNA sequence and the structure qualifies DNA as perfect material for “programmable” self-assembly. The recent development of the “DNA origami” technique is explored in the context of biophysics and bionanotechnology in this group.
Nanopores
Channels in lipid bilayer membranes can be used as detectors for the translocation of biological single molecules. The application of a voltage across a bilayer membrane leads to a current in the pico-ampere range due to an open membrane pore.  Molecules drawn through the pore because of electrophoresis cause a reduction of the ionic current. Statistical analysis of the current blockades of a large number of translocation events allows a characterization of the translocating species and its characterization. This popular technique is used in this lab for the characterization of unconventional  DNA and RNA structures.

He was an IEEE-LEOS Distinguished Lecturer for 1993-94 and is a fellow of both the IEEE and OSA.
What We Did
Building upon the CyanoBrick toolkit developed by the 2010 Utah State iGEM team, our project will focus on producing valuable bioproducts using Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. Our project will attempt to produce 3 different bioproducts: fatty alcohols, wax esters, and alkanes/alkenes. Fatty alcohols and wax esters are used to produce cosmetics, lubricants, and various pharmaceuticals. Fatty alcohols with a 20-carbon chain are used in the cold sore medication Abreva[reference needed], and long chain fatty alcohols have been linked to improved heart health [reference needed]. Alkanes and alkenes are utilized as hydrocarbon fuels. The production of these bioproducts in cyanobacteria will greatly reduce their cost and increase their availability. In addition to producing bioproducts, our project will also provide a more detailed characterization of the promoters and ribosome binding sites (RBS) produced by the 2010 Utah State iGEM Team. Utilizing a dual luciferase expression measurement construct, and reference promoters from E. coli and Synechocystis, our team will more precisely characterize the expression levels of 23 promoters under standard growth conditions, compared with the GFP-based measurements made in 2010. We will also produce useful intermediate parts, which are currently not available through the registry, allowing the dual luciferase expression measurement system to be easily adapted to new organisms and new reference promoters.
Team History
Utah State University first participated in the iGEM competition in 2008. Since then, the Utah State team has had the opportunity to put synthetic biology to use in many ways. Past projects include:
2008:  Efficient Systems for Monitoring PHB Production in Microorganisms
2009:  BioBricks without Borders
2010:  CyanoBricks: Developing a Cyanobacterial Toolbox
Throughout its participation, the Utah State team has brought home two gold medals as well as a bronze medal. Several former team members are now attending prestigious medical and graduate schools around the country. Others have gone on to successful careers in biotechnology.
Utah State University
Nestled in Cache Valley in northern Utah, Utah State University is sometimes overlooked as a quality college. Despite humble beginnings as a land-grant Agricultural School in 1888, USU has propelled itself into national status on the academic and athletic level. It was recently heralded as the #1 highest-ranked public university in the West and #4 in the nation for lowest tuition in ""America's Top Colleges"" (Forbes, ""America's Best College Buys,"" Aug. 2011). Engineering programs at USU consistently bring in laurels from national and international competitions.

About the team
Our team consists of members from different field of studies. We have four molecular biologist master students, a Biotechnology M.Sc. student and a biology bachelor student working in the wet lab. We also invited a high school student to join the team giving her a chance to try herself in the bond of a Lab at a University. We all think that it was fun and also beneficial to be together, learning from and supporting each other during the summer. We really got close to each other, and we're sure that we will keep in contact even after the Jamborees.

The outstanding collections of the local museums, the historical monuments of the city or the various and imposing programs of local folk traditions enchant all visitors who wish to explore the marvels of Debrecen: choir festivals, folk festivals, carnivals, breath-taking exhibitions, fairs offer their programs and goods for the visitors. At the same time Debrecen, which is a university centre, is also a place for conferences and scientific meetings, and this serves the active and organic cooperation of the city’s economic, scientific, educational and cultural life.
This culturally and scientifically active life is combined with a splendid leisure and wellness sphere as well: the recently renovated Mediterranean Aqua Park and the charming Zoo in the centre of the romantic Great Forest offer excellent time for the whole family, while the Aquaticum Wellness and Spa Resort designs exclusive health treatments and wellness care programmes for the visitors as Debrecen is one of the largest centres of mineral thermal water in Europe. This leisure life is enriched by the active sport life of the city: Debrecen has been hosting a number of national and international sports events from national championships to European and World championships. For the lovers of rural country life the Erdőspuszta territories and Hortobágy is a must to visit, because the calm and enchanting atmosphere is an excellent basis for relaxation, while those who seek pleasures in fishing, hunting and riding may also enjoy the region.
Thus, this city in the eastern periphery of the country is an unparalleled place – not only because of the flourishing cultural, scientific and social life but because of the dynamic economic and industrial traditions as well, which has established an outstanding and marvellous atmosphere in Debrecen.
University of Debrecen
The history of higher education in Debrecen goes back to the 16th century. The city established the Calvinist College of Debrecen in 1538. The College became soon the most important cultural center of the whole country, where a great number of writers, scientists and politicians received their education.
In the 18th century the schools of Law and Theology were founded and although no separate School of Medicine existed, physicians were also trained in the College. Today's University Medical School is rooted in this spiritual heritage. The present day Debrecen is also famous for its schools and higher educational establishments. The Medical School of the University of Debrecen is Central Europe's first campus medical school. It was in the year of the millennium (1896) of Hungary's foundation when the establishment of a modern University was decided upon in Debrecen. The University was officially inaugurated on October 23, 1918 and at that time consisted of four faculties: Arts, Science, Theology and Medicine. The Faculty of Medicine became an independent  University Medical School under the supervision of the Ministry of Health in 1951.
The Medical School has 22 departments of basic sciences and 25 clinical departments specializing in various fields e.g. clinical chemistry, internal medicine, surgery, orthopedics, radiology, neurology, neurosurgery, psychiatry, pediatrics, obstetrics and gynecology, cardiology and pulmonology, oto-rhino-laryngology, dermatology, ophthalmology, stomatology and urology. The Medical School serves as the city hospital for Debrecen therefore students of upper terms may also obtain their clinical training here.
Education at Debrecen Medical School is accredited by the World Health Organization, US Department of Education, The State Education Department (NY, USA), Medical Board of California , the General Medicine Council (UK - PLAB exam is compulsory), Medical Councils of Israel, Ireland, Iran and Norway. In most European countries - not listed above - and also in India the diploma of the University of Debrecen, Medical and Health Science Center is accepted for registration purposes; however a qualifying exam is compulsory.
The Lab
The Nuclear Receptor Research lab, led by László Nagy, focuses on the molecular and cell biology of lipid activated transcription factors, so called nuclear receptors. We are interested in the molecular details of hormone action. Lipid soluble hormones such as oestrogens and retinoids act via these receptors that bind to and regulate the expression of certain genes. The aim of the eleven PhD students, four postdocs and senior researchers, associated with several undergraduate students is to understand the details and molecular determinants of these interactions using molecular and cell biological approaches.
To do so, we target our questions from different aspects, applying high variety of techniques, including basic RNA and protein biology, advanced microscopy, animal models, microarray techniques and bioinformatics. The Genomics Center is a core facility and research laboratory, a unit of the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology (University of Debrecen Medical and Health Science Center). It has been established to support the University of Debrecen scientific community, as well as other academic research teams interested in using high-throughput genomics and bioinformatics for their research projects. We put special emphasis on supporting clinical genomics projects investigating the pathomechanism of diseases or searching for novel drug targets.

IIT Madras iGEM Team 2011
(Hover over the names to find out more)
Chaitra: She’s got ‘em retro bell-bottom pants from the 80’s. Fancy. The one and only matriarch of the team, she does a good job of taking care of the whole lot of us. She frets, but we cheer her up. She works quietly, but Avaneesh makes sure she makes some noise. She’s hella cool, but we don't tell her that. By the way, her surname is Prabhakara and she’s from Bangalore so that’s a couple of +1’s on the coolness scale.
Chaitra is (another) Senior in the Department of Biotechnology, and can be found in the molecular biology lab. Look for the bell-bottoms if you want to find her. Kthxbai.
Sri Teja Mullapudi: “Pinku” Mullapodi is your friendly team workaholic. He resembles a shaggy mountain goat, and sleeps like a dead mountain goat. He even bleats once in a while. Wake him up, and I assure you that you will gain the respect of the whole team (we’ve tried and failed numerous times, it’s impossible!). He’s always bristling with energy and enjoys cracking random PJs once in a while to make sure the team sighs in unison. He enjoys MCing and we think he would do well to identify and work on this talent of his. We enjoy his bleating, and we love placing wagers on who’s going to succeed in waking him up so he’s definitely an asset to our team. Great company, no kidding!
Teja is a Junior in the Department of Biotechnology. He’s currently working on molecular virology, and kills time playing Monster Dash and dreaming about MCing.
Vivek Parthasarathy: Lovingly (and unintentionally) referred to by the Director of IIT Madras as Vivek Parathasarathy (this is a paratha), he claims that he is NOT available at any cafeterias. He’s fascinated by his own voice, and seems to be proud of the fact that he can get under people’s skins/cheer them up at will. Blah blahblahblah, blah blahblah- if you want to hear the full story hit him up at vivek.windwaker@gmail.com. Partha’s in charge of raking in the moolah for the team, and he aspires to handle PR as well (yeah, right!). He claims his midi-chlorian count is higher than yours.
Vivek is a Junior in the Department of Biotechnology. He splits his free time between cricket, bringing in funds, and trying to find his true calling in the biological sciences.
Varun Chokshi: He’s the chill dude of the team. Period. He doesn’t dance to his circadian rhythms, although he’s usually not that into dancing. When you hear a burst of hindi, usually curses at a dratted BlackBerry- you know it’s theChoksh (he’s Indian, so Varun works fine as well). With his level-headedness and an inability to lose hope, even in the face of an impending deadline, he sits around clicking away at his old Dell. Remember, don’t panic!
Varun is a Senior in the Department of Biotechnology, and spends time away from iGEM working on cardiovascular genetics (He claims it’s not as fancy as it sounds. Really?)
Avaneesh Thautam: Dommi. The man on a mission .The mission: To not cut his hair ever again. Progress: Considerable enough to make us flinch when we see his locks. Our plan: To shear his lovely locks off when he’s not looking. Wish us luck! If he’s not working tirelessly in the LF hood, he’s probably tired and asleep, curled up in a blanket in a corner of our lab. Either that or he’s getting into a heated discussion with Chaitra, so yeah.  He’s perpetually spaced out, although he makes sure he gets his point across crystal clear. When he’s around, working becomes fun (at his expense!).
Avaneesh is (the last) Senior (on the team) in the Department of Biotechnology, and works in the vascular biology lab. Remember, look for the locks. May the force be with you.
Chetan Srinath: This bird-man is a Junior in the Department of Biotechnology. An inspirational high school teacher got him interested in biology and he hasn't looked back since. IBO fame apart, Chetan is a Bangalore loving dude who is usually found playing football, or immersed in fantasy books (GRRM ftw!). He intends to do a Master's and a PhD in the biological sciences although he hasn't decided on what he'd like to specialize in just yet.
Don't miss a chance to get candid with the bio-geek at chetan.srinath@gmail.com.
Vinay Lathi: RG god. Rings a bell? Actually it prolly means striking a bell with a Lathi. If you don’t understand this, worry not. If you do, ask yourself this question- are you from IIT Madras? If you are, stop smirking and get back to work on whatever you were working on before you stumbled across this user profile. For you non-IIT Madras people, hello and welcome to Vinay’s bio. He claims to waste lots of times on his computer fixing “bugs”, but we all know what he means by that, right? (actually no, but we just like sounding like we’re a bunch of smart alecs). Vinay likes giving a deeper meaning to the things he does, and enjoys the recognition that comes with hard work. Fancy!
Vinay is a Junior in the Department of Biotechnology, and is currently looking to work on something that enables him to see the patterns in biology and make sense of them. Pester him at vinaylathi@gmail.com.
Sonia Chothani: The dancer girl/lab rat/Son. The team tries to take care of the Son. The rest of the team chose to foster her and let her labor away in the lab as a way of expressing her gratitude. NOT. She’s from Mumbai, and she claims she can drive- although we beg to differ. On a different note, she’s one of them team “juniors”, she won’t turn 21 until after iGEM so she’ll prolly have to make do with a good dance at Jillian’s. Which she will, considering the fact she’s a pro dancer. But yeah, we all think she’s awesome. She is. She really is.
Sonia is a Senior in the Department of Biotechnology. Sonia splits her free time between dancing and computational modeling/bioinformatics.
Nayan Jain: The Nyan Cat is his evil spawn. When Nayannyans, the Nyan Cat listens. In case you’re wondering what in the world a Nyan Cat is, find out here. Pop tarts and rainbow fart apart, say hello to the quietest member of the team. He’s all composed and stuff (but we think his demeanor is a big pile of mumbo-jumbo). He just turned 21, and all he craves for is a nice, frilly pink dress. The things people crave for when they realize they’re getting old- crazy! Interestingly enough, we intend to make him our mascot next year so feel free to mail in designs to nayanjain28@gmail.com. There’s a catch though- theyHAVE to be pink.
Nayan is a Junior in the Department of Biotechnology, and he hasn’t homed in on what he wants to work on yet. Remember- respect the SMRL!
Abhishek De: De. That is his surname and not a typo. Surprised much? Well, we’ve gotten used to it. The muscle man of the team, Abhi helps us with the circuitry and wiki-editing. We’ve pretty much convinced ourselves that he glorifies the process of connectingbatteries to LEDs, but the circuits do their job so we let him be. The day De’s lights go out, night will fall. Ominous, yes. His interest in neuroscience put him on path that eventually led him to us, and he’s been a welcome addition to the team ever since.
Abhishek is a Junior in the Department of Electrical Engineering, and has chosen to focus on network theory to help him understand neural networks better. Connect with him at abhishekde95@gmail.com.
Kousik Sundararajan: Cow-sick. That’s how you pronounce his name. What’s in a name, you ask? Well ask Kousik. We estimate that he’s spent roughly half his social life teaching people how to pronounce his name, so we hope you’ll get it right the first time. He’s our team man, and he moderates and mediates his way to glory. Oh and he went home for Diwali. We have no idea why we decided to throw that random piece of information at you but we did, so ha! He’s our team’s official source for manga references, with his Japan connect and all. Or so we think.
Kousik is a Senior in the Department of Biotechnology, and works on cancer biology when he isn’t helping people settle scores.
Govind Krishna Joshi: If you want to strike fear into this kid’s heart, utter but one word. Passport. It’s bound to bring him to his knees begging for forgiveness and mercy. But don’t put him through that, because he’s theguruji. He follows the way of the Ninja, and gets work done swooping in and out of the lab unseen, and unheard. You won’t be seeing him at the World Championship Jamboree this year but we assure you that the P word won’t scare him as much next year. If you feel like comforting him, go ahead and IM him at govindkrjoshi@gmail.com.
Govind is a Junior in the Department of Biotechnology. He uses his ninja skills to slip into the vascular biology lab under the cover of night to get some work done before his weekly reviews.

Abhishek De: De. That is his surname and not a typo. Surprised much? Well, we’ve gotten used to it. The muscle man of the team, Abhi helps us with the circuitry and wiki-editing. We’ve pretty much convinced ourselves that he glorifies the process of connectingbatteries to LEDs, but the circuits do their job so we let him be. The day De’s lights go out, night will fall. Ominous, yes. His interest in neuroscience put him on path that eventually led him to us, and he’s been a welcome addition to the team ever since.
Abhishek is a Junior in the Department of Electrical Engineering, and has chosen to focus on network theory to help him understand neural networks better. Connect with him at abhishekde95@gmail.com.
Kousik Sundararajan: Cow-sick. That’s how you pronounce his name. What’s in a name, you ask? Well ask Kousik. We estimate that he’s spent roughly half his social life teaching people how to pronounce his name, so we hope you’ll get it right the first time. He’s our team man, and he moderates and mediates his way to glory. Oh and he went home for Diwali. We have no idea why we decided to throw that random piece of information at you but we did, so ha! He’s our team’s official source for manga references, with his Japan connect and all. Or so we think.
Kousik is a Senior in the Department of Biotechnology, and works on cancer biology when he isn’t helping people settle scores.
Govind Krishna Joshi: If you want to strike fear into this kid’s heart, utter but one word. Passport. It’s bound to bring him to his knees begging for forgiveness and mercy. But don’t put him through that, because he’s theguruji. He follows the way of the Ninja, and gets work done swooping in and out of the lab unseen, and unheard. You won’t be seeing him at the World Championship Jamboree this year but we assure you that the P word won’t scare him as much next year. If you feel like comforting him, go ahead and IM him at govindkrjoshi@gmail.com.
Govind is a Junior in the Department of Biotechnology. He uses his ninja skills to slip into the vascular biology lab under the cover of night to get some work done before his weekly reviews.

Myth: Transgenic maize can cause harm in humans.
The corn marketed as StarLink™  is one of the reasons this myth has spread, they produce a protein endotoxin as insecticide.  This raised concern since it could be allergic or harmful for humans and, since the US Environmental Protection Agency could not find certainty of no harm to humans, the corn wasn’t approved for human consumption.
Fact:  Conventional maize is transgenic.
A transgenic organism is an organism that contains a gene or genes transferred from another organism (this could be from the same or from a different species). According to an article by the CANIA (an institute of nutrition of Venezuela), maize crops  are the ones with the highest level of domestication in cultivated plants. This means that man, considering the properties like the size or the resistance to heat, selects the crops. The selection of the best species is necessary to improve the quality of the product.
Because of the cultural features, a lot of options are available. Either natural or induced, causing the existence of many varieties and hybrids.  We can call all these hybrids “transgenic”, because they contain genes from others plants. Therefore, all the corn that we consume is a transgenic organism with a mixture of genes that our ancestors considered the best options to improve the maize.
The corn marketed as StarLink™ is not only an example of genetically modified organism (GMO) with issues, but also an example of the regulations of the GMO don't allow the release of a product that can be harmful for humans.
Myth: Biotechnological modifications of crops and foods are very different from traditional methods.
Reality: Biotechnology has helped the traditional agricultural methods.
In the last 10,000 years, people have used their knowledge to improve food production. Farmers used to cross their plant to obtain features of interest. But this method was highly unproductive since a lot of effort was placed in obtaining a desired feature.
Genetic modification is a more efficient and accurate tool that has allowed scientists to find the specific gen they need for a particular trait. Later on, this gen could be cloned and introduced to a plant which would get the desirable characteristic.
It´s not that easy for the plant to express the desirable feature, even so, genetic modification has allowed the next advances:
• Plants resistant to insects.
• Resistant stems harsh climates
• Higher yields of production
To get more information, visit actionbioscience.org and read the article: Biotechnology in crops: Issues for the developing world, and Crop Biotechnology: Feeds for livestock from the university of California.
Fact: No genetically modified organism is released if it doesn’t comply with the regulation required.
In the United States, the regulation of genetically engineered (GE) foods is divided among three federal agencies: the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) (oversees GE crop field trials); the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)(for selectable marker genes and proteins in crop development); the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) (conducts voluntary consultations on other aspects of GE foods with the companies that choose to consult it). For more information about these agencies, please consult the review Safety Testing and Regulation of Genetically Engineered Foods in Biotechnology and Genetic Engineering Reviews.
In Mexico, the regulation is based on the Mexican Constitution that establishes the general guidelines to be followed by government dependencies.
Some examples are:
•Ley General de Salud (Health General Law)
•Ley Federal de Sanidad Vegetal (Federal Law of Vegetal Sanity)
•Ley federal sobreMetrología y Normalización (Federal Law about Metrology and Normalization)
•Ley Federal sobre Producción, Certificación y Comercio de Semillas (Federal Law about Production, Certification and Trade of Seeds)
• Normas OficialesMexicanas (NOM) (Official Mexican Standards).
An important law that regulates most of the crops in Mexico is the Ley de Bioseguridad de Organismos Genéticamente Modificados (Biosecurity Law for Genetically Modified Organisms). This law regulates the activities of confine employ, experimental, pilot program and commercial release, marketing, import and export of GM organism.
For more information, you can consult it here
For more information about Biotechnology and Biosecurity in Mexico check the review of the Mexican Congress here
Myth: The production of resistant crops to pests and weeds will create immune “super insects”.
Reality: There is no scientific study that suggests this scenario may happen as a result of a genetically engineered crop production. Even so, there are a plenty of systems to prevent this scenario: crop rotation, hybrid rotation, and pest integral manage. Insects and weeds are not the same as they were in the past, but biotechnology could potentially improve their management so they do not gain a resistant.
To get more info see: Crop rotation form Penn State university and the site oisat.org
Myth: The crops produces by biotechnology will have a negative impact on the environment.
The origin of the myth is based in the conviction that the genetically modified (GM) crops promote insects’ resistance and affect the soil.
Fact: Genetically modified organisms (GMO) cause some positive impacts. According to the Journal of Agrobiotechnology Management & Economics, GMO have benefits related to the changes of insecticide and herbicide use and the reduction of greenhouse gases.
(GHG) emission levels. The use of genetically modified organisms has resulted in 224 million kg less pesticide use and a 15.3% reduction in the environmental impact associated with pesticide use. The GM crops also contribute in the reduction of GHG emissions of 9 billion kg in 2005, equivalent to removing 4 million cars from the roads. For more information about this study, click here .
An example of the employment of Biotechnology to substitute the use of pesticides, are the transgenic plants expressing Bacillus thuringiensis toxins. B. thuringiensis is a bacterium that produce a toxin that has been used as insecticide and as a natural regulator of insects. In accordance with an article of Nature Biotechnology journal, these organisms have also the capacity to delay insects’ resistance evolution in the plants.
Myth: The long-term effects produced by biotechnological generated food are unknown.
Reality: A lot of years of research have allowed scientists to know the enormous benefits that biotechnological food provides. The scientific consensus says that the risks associated with foods derived from biotechnology are fundamentally the same as the  other food products. Current science shows that foods produced through biotechnology are safe for consumption and there are a plenty of regulatory authorities like the FDA, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, and EPA that have determined that these products are safe.
To get more info visit the sites of FDA, EPA and the U.S. Department of Agriculture
Controversy on Stem Cells
Stem cells have been an object of interest for many biotechnology researchers. Stem cells are cells that can divide and differentiate into diverse cells types. They have potential to treat tumors, tissue regeneration, diabetes, Parkinson, neuronal regeneration and hearth attacks.
The controversial discussion around stem cells is because of their origin. In the beginning, they came from  embryos which were destroyed after the cells were obtained. The problem is that life begins once the embryo is fertilized.
What most people don’t know is that there are different types of stem cells: Embryonic and Adult. The embryonic stem cells are obtained from a fertilized embryo; meanwhile, adult stem cells are obtained from other sources such as teeth, bone marrow and umbilical cords. These type of cells could be used to avoid controversy and they may also be used in therapeutic treatments.
To get more information, see the article: Las células madre embrionarias totipotenciales by Guzmán and Solís from UNAM Gaceta Biomédica 2006.

Our headquarters for the development of this project were the facilities at the FEMSA Biotechnology Center at the Tecnológico de Monterrey in Monterrey, Mexico. At this center, we were kindly given access to the Laboratory of Genetic Manipulation and Molecular Diagnostics, which became our main workplace throughout the summer. It was in this laboratory that we had all the necessary equipment to perform most of our experiments: DNA extractions, gel electrophoresis, ligations, digestions and gel purifications, as well as space to carry out research for the development of the project.
We also had access to the Fifth Floor Research Facilities at the Biotechnology Center, where we performed the part of the project that demanded much more sophisticated equipment, such as transformations by electroporation, quantifications and fluorescence assays.
Additionaly, part of our work had to be done at the ITESM School of Medicine, namely the preparation of electrocompetent cells.  This Center, located at the Tecnológico de Monterrey in Monterrey, Mexico, is devoted to the generation of research, the transfer of knowledge and the modeling of new business schemes that involve biotechnology and food technology areas. For such reasons, it is equiped with cutting-edge infraestructure in laboratories, pilot plants and business incubators.
The Center emerged 15 years ago as a response to the increasing trends in scientific and technologic innovation in the country and the whole world and through time it has supported the following lines of research, all focused in the innovation of products, processes and services:
Food Biotechnology:
• Study of biomolecules found in Mexican plants and foods with therapeutic properties.
• Development and optimization of new food products and processes.
Bioprocess Engineering:
• Design, scaling and optimization of biotechnological processes.
• Pharmaceutical and Medical Biotechnology:
• Development and validation of new drugs.
• Molecular diagnostic of diseases.
• Culture and differentiation of tissues.
• Biological Chemistry:
• Isolation and characterization of biologically active compounds.
• Synthesis of new drugs
• Design of new materials with applications in the pharmaceutical and biotechnological industries.
Some of the strategic partners of the center are:
• Cambridge University, UK
• Texas A&M University
• Cornell University
• Arizona State University
• University of California (San Diego & Davis)
• Carnegie Mellon University
Some of the achievements of the center are:
• More than 14 patent requests.
• More than 250 papers published in journals with high indexing level.
• 3 published books.
• 12 book chapters
• 30 researches, of which, more than 70% belong to the National System of Researchers.
The Monterrey Institute of Higher Education, or in Spanish Instituto Tecnológico y de Estudios Superiores de Monterrey (ITESM, or simply Tec de Monterrey) is one of the largest private, non-profit, independent coeducational multi-campus universities with no political or religious affiliation in Latin America. It is based in Monterrey, Mexico and has 33 campuses throughout the country, in addition to international presence through liaison offices in 12 foreign countries. It has one of the top graduate business schools in the region (EGADE) and is one of the leaders in patent applications among Mexican universities.
The Tecnológico de Monterrey was founded in 1943 as a result of the far-reaching vision and the commitment of Don Eugenio Garza Sada and a group of businessmen. Today, when reality has outreached the original concept, the Tecnológico de Monterrey includes practically all the areas of knowledge, having an educational offering that consists of a wide assortment of undergraduate majors, specialties, Masters Degree programs, medical specialty programs, and Ph.D. programs in the fields of Agriculture, Architecture, Biotechnology, Business and Management, Communications, Design and Applied Art, Engineering and Sciences, Health, Humanities and Social Sciences, Information Technology, and Law, among others.
The Tecnológico de Monterrey is working to be the most widely recognized educational institution in Latin America for the leadership exercised by alumni in the private, public, and social sectors, and for the research and technological development it carries out to promote a knowledge-based economy, generating management and business incubators models, improving public administration and public policies, and creating innovative models and systems for the sustainable development of the community.
The educational model emphasizes collaborative work and uses didactic techniques such as problem-based learning, project-oriented learning, and the case-solving method. In this way knowledge is applied to solving real-life problems, it makes studying meaningful and becomes the object of critical reflection and social commitment. There is also a big emphasis and commitment on generating knowledge and creating an entrepreneurial culture.
During the past years, the Institution has turned its attention to biotechnology, heavily investing in infrastructure, teaching and laboratory equipment. This includes the FEMSA Biotechnology Center, which is an intellectual hub for the different researchers and students that come together. The Institute now offers undergraduate, M.Sc. and Ph.D. studies in Biotechnology in different fields such as Food Biotechnology, Bioprocess Engineering, Biopharmaceuticals and Bioproducts.

Team Attributions
Thelma Bolón
She was in charge of the enzymatic assay that involved one of our constructs, as well as general lab work. Her disposition and devotion are worth mentioning, as she never gave up on the toughest moments and always carried on with her endeavors.
Fausto Ortíz
He was in charge of the experiments that involved arabinose induction, as well as general lab work. Calm and collected, good-humored and always positive, he’s someone who kept his soul even after losing his gallbladder.
Anita Sifuentes
As our only non-B.S. student, she created the wiki and the video, and was as well involved in our augmented reality program. A small but great woman, who despite having a bigger understanding of computers than of her own body, became interested in the dream of a bunch of strangers and made great things out of it.
Camilo Chávez
He performed general laboratory work, helping to build one construct.  Such a weird and strange person who might as well become one of your best friends. Someone who can make you laugh just after he’s made you want to kill him, he’s got molecular biology skills that far surpass his DJ skills.
Rolando Moreno
He was responsible for contacting our sponsors and suppliers.  It’s said around campus that he’s a man full of love, and he very well is. With his great size also comes a great friend. Faster at thinking than at speaking, he always tries to find what’s better for everyone else.
Bong Min Bae
She performed general laboratory work, helping to build one construct. She was the main responsible of lab work and teaching several techniques to other team members. We are seriously hoping of hearing great things about this woman in the next 10 years, well, that’s if she starts sleeping just a bit. A total workaholic, she always does her best to make better everything that’s already perfect.
Gabriela Gutiérrez
She was in charge of the biosafety research and essay. Although small, her multitasking abilities are worth of awe. Even when doing five things at a time, she’s always focused on all of them. Her kindness and friendliness are equals, and she’ll never say “no” to a request of help.
Margarita Calixto
She was in charge of sponsors and of contact with iGEM headquarters. She’s also the mistress of electrocompetents. Not only pretty, but she also commits to whatever she’s doing in a kind of hardcore way. But anyway, the best of people are always hardcore, always giving the best of themselves and giving both soul and body at school, work and life.
Jesús Hernández
The unofficial leader of our team, he coordinated most of the lab work and worked a lot with diverse gels and the high performance gel imaging systems.  Although his looks are deceiving, he slowly became the key for getting the whole project going through the correct words and attitude, creativity and a whole lot of patience.
MS.C. Sergío García
Sergio taught us hands-on most of the non-basic protocols and procedures we needed in the laboratory. A true tor-mentor, both an angel and a demon coexisting in one being, not only because he’s also called Angel, but because an infinite source of knowledge and advise not only result in the best of projects, but also in the development of the best of scientists.
Dr. Manuel Zertuche
Dr. Zertuche, on behalf of the School of Biotechnology and Food Engineering of the Tecnológico de Monterrey. He provided us with the facilities and gave us his approval for almost everything we asked for. Before meeting him, we had never tried to reach for the stars, but he taught us how to do it. We’re really thankful for having you believe in us, and for giving us your smile on every visit. We thank you for being part of iGEM Tec-Monterrey 2011.
Dr. José Manuel Aguilar
He helped us with the theoretical information and developed the initial idea for our project. Way more than an instructor, he’s a friend who gave us all of his trust and affection; who taught us to think much more as researchers than as technicians. Thank you for all of the times when you made all of those questions we couldn’t answer, because that’s what a true teacher does: ask you for more every time, since he knows you’ve still got much more to give.
Dr. Guy Cardineau
He provided us with a lot of supplies, guidance and overall support, almost like a “lab-dad” for us. It’s because of professors like you that there are students like us, willing to follow your steps. You’ve taught us that dreams can become true, and that we’ve got to strive to reach them.
Dr. Marco Rito-Palomares
As our main instructor, he provided us the tools to keep on working. This dream could’ve not come true if you had not believed on us and given us the backup of the whole institution, teaching us that for realizing a dream, all you need is waking up from it.
Sincerely, the whole project would’ve gone to dust had it not been due to the commitment and dedication of each and every team member, who managed to come out unscathed from both good and bad situations gazing towards the future, together.

Mito: La aplicación de la biotecnología a cultivos y alimentos es muy diferente a los métodos de agricultura tradicionales.
Realidad: La biotecnología es una evolución de los métodos tradicionales de agricultura. En los últimos 10, 000 años, la gente usa rutinariamente sus conocimientos para mejorar la producción de alimentos. Los agricultores mejoraban una planta cruzándola con otra que tuviera una característica deseada, para agregar o eliminar rasgos específicos genéticos de una planta. Pero este método era inexacto ya que para que se lograran transmitir de una generación a otra la característica deseada tenían que hacer muchas cruzas.
Ahora con ayuda de la modificación genética, es más eficiente y preciso lograr los beneficios del mejoramiento en los cultivos; usando nuevas tecnologías, los científicos tienen la posibilidad de precisar el gen específico responsable de un rasgo en particular, para poder extraerlo o añadirlo a una planta específica.
Regularmente toma mucho tiempo hacer que una planta exprese una característica deseada, a pesar de ello, han sido capaces de generar plantas:
• Resistentes a sequías, pesticidas y enfermedades.
• Tallos más fuertes para resistir fuertes vientos.
• Rendimientos más altos.
Para más información, visita el sitio actionbioscience.org y lee el artículo Biotechnology in crops: Issues for the developing world y también el artículo Crop Biotechnology: Feeds for Livestock de la Universidad de California.
MITO: La producción de cultivos resistentes a ciertas plagas y malezas dará lugar a “superinsectos “ y/o “supermalezas” que son inmunes a los métodos existentes de manejo de plagas y malezas.
REALIDAD: No hay estudios científicos que sugieran esta clase de escenario pueda ocurrir como resultado de los cultivos producidos usando biotecnología. Sin embargo, existen muchos sistemas incluyendo la rotación de cultivos, la rotación de híbridos y el manejo integrado de plagas que se emplean como una medida de precaución que ayuda a prevenir que esto ocurra. Insectos y maleza ya han evolucionado y desarrollado tolerancia o resistencia a su entorno, por lo que la biotecnología puede lograr, potencialmente, mejor manejo de esta evolución de la resistencia.
Para obtener más información ver Crop rotation de Penn State university y el sitio oisat.org
Mito: Se desconocen los efectos a largo plazo de los alimentos desarrollados usando biotecnología.
Realidad: Durante años de investigación, científicos conocen que los beneficios de los alimentos biotecnológicos son enormes. El consenso científico dice que los riesgos asociados con los productos alimenticios obtenidos por biotecnología son fundamentalmente los mismos a los otros alimentos. La ciencia actual muestra que los alimentos producidos mediante la biotecnología son seguros para su consumo y una gran cantidad de autoridades regulatorias como la FDA, el departamento de agricultura de
EE.UU. y la EPA han determinado que estos productos son seguros para introducirse en el suministro de alimentos.

Las Células Madre y su Controversia
Las Células Madre han sido el objeto de más investigación en la biotecnología en los últimos años debido a su gran potencial para tratar diversas enfermedades como tratamiento contra tumores, regeneración de tejidos, diabetes tipo I, parkinson, regeneración neuronal e infartos. Una Célula Madre es una célula indiferenciada que puede transformarse en otro tipo de célula. Indiferenciada significa la célula aún no tiene una función específica en el organismo.
El debate alrededor del uso de estas células involucra un dilema ético debido a que provienen de un embrión que es destruido al momento de hacer investigaciones o usarlas. De acuerdo a muchas religiones, la vida comienza a partir de la fecundación así que su destrucción podría ser considerada como la pérdida de una vida.
Lo que la mayoría de la gente no sabe es que hay dos tipos de Células Madre: Embrionarias y Adultas. Las Embrionarias, como se menciona antes, son obtenidas de un embrión cuando tiene entre 4-5 días de edad. Por otro lado, las Adultas son obtenidas de otros tejidos como el cordón umbilical, médula osea entre otras.
Éste segundo tipo de célula madre es el que se puede usar para evitar la controversia y poder realizar las investigaciones en pro de la salud.

One of our human practice achievements is the “Augmented Reality Biobrick Software” in which the technology, science and a little bit of fun are combined. Our software is useful tool both for iGEMers and non-iGEMers as an interactive option to teach and learn more about the synthetic biology. During the iGEM competition, the iGEMers can use this software to build up their genetic constructs with a user-friendly-interphase that can store 3D symbolic models of constructions. As a teaching tool it can be used as representations of biobricks in a more immersive way, being able not only to control the buildup of genetic constructions but also to learn about the interactions between prefixes and suffixes.
If you want to build your biobricks in a new and entertaining way you only need a webcam and to follow these simple instructions!
1.- Download and install "".exe"" file (Biotecnologia.exe)
2.- Download and print "".pdf"" file in black and white (save ink!)
3.- Cut the printed figures, they represent the parts for the construct
4.- Once ""Biotecnologia.exe"" is running, place the figures in webcam view, you'll be able to see them on screen.
5.- Find the image representing a Plasmid backbone.
6.- Next, select another part to add, whether it is a promoter, a ribosome binding site, a coding sequence, or even a terminator. In order to do so, you must put a part next to the plasmid backbone image and wait for a few seconds to begin assembling.
7.- Place the parts in the order you want and capture your construct in a "".jpg"" file for further reviewing.
If you need to delete a part click on it and then delete.
If you want to save the image click on save and you will have your construct ready.
If you have any questions, send us an email!
Augmented Reality creates a mix between reality and a 3D computer program, by taking information from the physical world, a computer or any other electronic device is able to complement what you are seeing or hearing with multimedia information. Some programs let you interect with them, other show small animation sequences but all of them exploit the boundaries between reality and CG graphics.
We thank a lot Engineer Pablo Guillermo Ramírez Flores and Engineer Héctor Eduardo Ramírez from the ""Center for Knowledge Systems"" (Centro de Sistemas de Conocimientos) for helping us create this program. We think your world and ours have so many differences that can be joined to create magic!

Since its inception, our project was aimed directly towards helping society. Our main goal was to update a process for a dying industry in Mexico. Sugar cane, once an agricultural product of international value, is now left to wither due to high production costs, low demand and the rise of alternative sweeteners. Millions of Mexican families depend on the sugar cane factories located in their villages; not only is their income in peril, but their very way of life.
We hope to address an old but growing problem. This is something overlooked  due to the development  of new issues and new difficulties, but something that we think deserves our time and effort. We propose an alternative production scheme that might serve to revive an industry.  From sugar cane, we can extract sucrose,  which then can be transformed into fructose and used in the current sweetening processes. With the immobilization method we use, the number of steps are reduced and production costs are reduced. If this process is improved, a new demand for sugar cane arises, which has the potential for a significant prositive impact on the lives of millions of Mexicans.
We believe that synthetic biology is not only for increasing knowledge, but it also provides a platform for research projects and studies that are aimed towards helping people improve their quality of life. Hence, iGEM encourages teams around the world to promote synthetic biology in their local communities.  In order to fulfill this task, we organized a series of activities during our summer and the beginning of our semester.
We also worked collabratively with the technology department in order to develop an augmented reality software. Using physical marks and a webcam we are able to create a real-time interaction program that allows you to assemble biobricks. This can be used to build genetic constructs with a user-friendly-interfase that can store 3D symbolic models of constructions. As a teaching tool, it can be used as representations of biobricks in a more immersive way, being able not only to control the assembly of genetic constructions but also to learn about the interactions between prefixes and suffixes.
This software, along with the instructions for use, is available here .
Our main event in took place during the summer when we hosted a meeting for all the Mexican teams in our campus. We held a series of conferences in order to discuss synthetic and molecular biology, not only the research projects or the technological aspects of the new advances and discoveries but also, the ethical impact our field has in people’s daily lives.
We also saved a special part in our congress to discuss and review the difficulties of importing genetic material into Mexico. Not only our team, but also our fellow teams, had problems receiving our kits. The Customs Agency in our country gave us a hard time but, with the help of Manuel Tiscareño (customer manager of Fedex at the Monterrey International Airport) , we were able to understand the bureaucratic process behind the entrance of biological material and find a solution to these problems.
We were very glad to receive our kit but we were also very happy that we could help our fellow teams along the way.  If you would like to read the full note, click here .
One of the first steps we took was writing a series of articles discussing the myths and facts of biotechnology. They were published in our school’s journalism webpage. Thanks to the ene.pé group (New Press), we had a place to review biofuels, genetic modified organisms and stem cells. In Mexican society, any modification in the natural structure of an organism is seen as taboo, hence, what we hoped to accomplish was to familiarize people with such terms by giving them clear and concise answers about biotechnology.
(The ene.pé website is undergoing a few server changes, but our articles will be available soon.)
An introductory workshop to the processes of synthetic biology was offered to freshmen students at our University campus. We worked with a DNA extraction kit, a common task in the lab, but since all the labs safety rules were followed strictly, students received a clear idea of what it's like to work on a research project.
Last but not least, we created an animation video in order to explain our process. We hoped to represent in a simple yet beautiful way how the enzyme immobilization process takes place. This video was made with Maya 2012, under the sponsorship granted by Autodesk to all iGEM teams. Anita Sifuentes, the team’s animation student, knows that designing with educational purposes in mind is a difficult task. It is not the easiest of jobs, but it is the one with the most impact and, for her, it’s also the most rewarding.
You can watch the video in our Main tab or by clicking here .
Recently a note related to our video went up in our Autodesk blog, which can be read here .

Currently, customs regulations in Mexico do not allow quick access for biological material, which includes the kits containing the biobricks sent to each team. This is not a new problem; thus iGEM team Tec-Monterrey 2010 (link) did, as Human Practice, a guide that explained the process, step by step, of importing biological material to Mexico without problems. However, this procedure consists of preparing the documents, sending them to Mexico City and waiting for the response from the pertinent authorities, supposing said documents are not rejected. This procedure may take three months approximately, depending on the location in which the team resides. Generally speaking, this is a procedure that can’t be applied in the case of kits arriving from the United States.
 
This year, three teams in México had problems with the arriving kits, our friends and colleagues ITESM_Mexico, UANLMty_Mexico and us. After some conversations between the teams and the iGEM Headquters, we decided to obtain the kits and look for an alternative method to get them. We also wanted to help our collegues because we wanted a fair competition, where all teams could have their kits in order to work with them at the beginning at the summer, with the same rules and the same instruments to do our best.
 
At first, we didn’t know the enormous amount of problems that we would confront with Mexican customs. First, we contacted M. Sc. Manuel Tiscareño, custom manager of FedEx at the Monterrey International Airport FedEx Customs Agency, in order to seek advice and support in obtaining the kits. He gave us tips, support and contacts in order to solve the problem. He also was invited to the Micro Congress carried out by us during the summer in our university.
 
Because of this contact, a lot of e-mails and some calls, we were able to obtain two kits that were retained in the Mexican customs at the Monterrey International Airport. We gave one kit to the UANLMty-Mexico and we sent the other one to ITESM_Mexico team in the city of Queretaro, Mexico.
 
We thank the collaboration of Shannon Gmyrek and Vinoo Selvarajah that were also involved in the situation and helped us with the documents required for the discharge of the kits.

In collaboration with “Nueva Prensa” (New Press, a student group of our University), we released interesting articles to share with people unrelated to biotechnology and synthetic biology, even though it is part of their daily lives. Said articles consisted on facts commonly known by everyone, but whose way of functioning are unknown, as well as the explanation of diverse myths that exist about genetic engineering. Below, you can see the links corresponding to the articles issued by “Nueva Prensa” on their website (www.enepe.org).
This is an amazing world we all should know about, as science should be part of our daily lives both unconsciously and consciously.

Individual presentation
Biology students
Adrien Lhomme-Duchadeuil
Master 1, Interdisciplinary approaches to Life Sciences (AIV), Paris Descartes University
As far as I can recall I was always immersed in Sciences  and multi-culturalism. Following a bilingual education in France,  I obtained an Honours Bachelor of Science in Anthroplogy and  in Biology from the University of Toronto. Drawing from such a  wide education, I really wish to participate in the iGEM  competition so that I can bring to the team my biology skills and  my anthroplogical knowledge. I want to seize the opportunity  and contribute to this new adventure that synthetic biology is.
Axel Séguret
Master1, Interdisciplinary approaches to Life Sciences (AIV), Paris Diderot University
After many talks with some teachers, I had the wish to  participate in the iGEM competition. The idea of life engineering  seems to me very interesting. To create standards could  simplify experiments and all shares. We are not yet researchers  but we have the ambition to achieve a research project end to  end. Finally, iGEM contributes to the development of synthetic  biology, while attempting to demystify the image of science. I  think science is accessible to people that get caught into the  game.
Camille Huet de Froberville
Master 1, Interdisciplinary approaches to Life Sciences (AIV), Paris Diderot University
It's in the Center for Research and Interdisciplinarity (CRI), I discovered and enjoyed really, Synthetic and  Systems Biology in a multidisciplinary and international  atmosphere that fitted me well. It's also during my master that I  heard about iGEM. It's for me, a unique opportunity to work in a  lab and to be confronted to its management. Moreover it allows  to completely get involved in a project that is ours from the  emerging idea to its realisation. Last, iGEM needs us to surpass  ourselves. That's something that motivates me a lot : pushing  further our limits to accomplish something that we can be proud  of.
Edward Kwarteng
Master 1, Interdisciplinary approaches to Life Sciences (AIV), Paris Descartes University
iGEM competition is the platform for young researchers to develop  their talents in such a world competition. Participating in iGEM  competition will give me the opportunity to think of a scientific  problem and design how to  solve it autonomously with  colleagues from different disciplines. It will enhance my  capabilities to work in a group and share ideas with fellows.  Synthetic biology is a great tool for future discoveries and i see  iGEM as the gateway for me to develop interest and equip  myself in this upcoming field of science.
Laura Da Silva
Master 1, Interdisciplinary approaches to Life Sciences (AIV), Paris Diderot University
While having a bachelor's degree in Biology of Lyon 1  University, physics and computer science have always  interested me. iGEM meaning interdisciplinarity: the mixture of  all basic sciences, represents, in my mind, a unique opportunity.  It is an adventure not only from the personal point of view:  working and setting up a team with students from different  backgrounds and interacting on different views of Life Sciences  induced, but also from a professional point of view: to have the  possibility at our study level to take part in the creation and in  the development by ourselves of our own scientific project, so  means a source of intellectual enrichment, at which I am willing  to take part.
Mathias Toulouze
Master 1, Interdisciplinary approaches to Life Sciences (AIV), Paris Diderot University
I am very impatient thinking about this competition. According to  me, it is a special opportunity offered to us. Indeed, in the  course of this competition we will have to  leverage our creativity, our passion for science and our team  spirit. Synthetic biology is an emerging discipline that has  already led to several innovations, which transforms a little  more, each day, our vision of life. iGEM is a unique opportunity  for us to learn and to excel.
Physics students
Ouriel Caën
Master 1, Theoretical Physics, Paris Diderot University
As a Physics student my curiosity and enthusiasm towards life  sciences has been the driving force to undertake a research  internship in an Israeli laboratory of modern theoretical  Biophysics. There, I learned that Biology is an inexhaustible source of  functions and systems which identification, recombination and  adaption will help to better understand life, and open a new era  of original and fruitful technologies. Synthetic Biology and iGEM  are the best way to implement this teaching. The numerous  testimonies of former iGEM participants evoking an invaluable  personal gain as much on social, organizational and  psychological dimensions, convinced me of my interest to join  the Paris iGEM team.
Hovannes Agopyan
Master 1, Physics for Biology, Paris Descartes University
An opportunity to work with future researchers in a daring  project? A way to get matches in scientifically viable? The  opportunity to be the strong link in a chain? To assume our  capabilities and know how to cooperate? Take pleasure by  advancing? That are the questions that I would like to meet and  answer through my participation in iGEM! I want to test my  own limits in a group that strives for excellence through powerful  synergies. iGEM is probably the missing link that connects  youth and dynamism to the particular world of research. Finally,  I see in iGEM the opportunity to serve Human being, regardless  of the adopted draft.
Computer sciences student
Adrien Basso-Blandin
Master 2, Computer Science, Evry University
My internship's subject deals with Synthetic biology and I would  like to do my thesis on the same subject. Thus, participating to  iGEM allow some practice in synthetic biology. It is also the  opportunity to share knowledge with members of other scientific  communities (biologist, physicist, engineer). Being computer-  scientist, I see iGEM like the creation of RISC processor, an  opportunity to search similitudes between different older projects  in order to model these. Hopefully, this research will simplify  next years work by proposing better computer-science tools for  project development.
Chemistry
Cyrille Pauthenier
Master 1, Chemistry, ENS Ulm
I'm a student in chemistry master at the Ecole Normale Supérieure. Aware that most of the common chemicals we use in our everyday life derived from oil and because I also enjoy studying biology, I started to focus my interest on living materials as an alternative source of carbon for chemistry, and natural chemical transformation processes. This is how I first stepped in Biocatalysis. Then, I discovered the iGEM contest, and get very fan of the idea of engineering life for our own human interest. I'm a very motivated guy, loving to work in team, and on such interesting projects. My aim is to go on in Synthetic Biology after the contest, and probably make a PhD in metabolic pathway engineering.
Pharmacy and Medical students
Babak Nichabouri
2nd year, Pharmacy, Paris Descartes University
I am currently following the Pharma.D Phd Program. I have to  do a summer internship in the lab of my choice. I chose the CRI  for the multi disciplinary aspect and particularly innovative side.  It is important for me to not shut myself away into one particular  domain, as interesting as it is, and to be always open minded.  iGEM is not only a simple lab internship, it is a pedagogic  program, with no equal, and we will learn as well about people  we work with as ourselves. But iGEM is also a competition, a  great team challenge that motivates us to do great things and do  better still.
Danyel Lee
3rd year, Medicine, Paris Descartes University
I learned about iGEM from a classmate that also wants to  participate in the project. A unique project planned and carried  out by a interdisciplinary group of students, both creative and  innovative, iGEM was clearly not an opportunity that i could  pass by. I look forward to learning from the other members,  learning through the experience, and contributing my own  knowledge and assets to the team.
Kevin Yauy
3rd year, Medicine, Paris Descartes University
I wanted to participate to iGEM for a long time and this year I  have finally possibility, motivation and energy to do it! The project  sounds amazing, work with other peoples, discover new things  in biology, do research. Enpowering my mind. I'm very  interested because I think that I can learn different things with  this competition than if I do another classic internship. It will be  a special experience to live and this is the moment maybe  when ideas of mine and the team could change our world.
Engineering students
Baptiste Couly
3rd Year, Engineer, Ecole des Mines ParisTech
I am an engineering student in his final year of study at Mines ParisTech. I discovered synthetic biology almost by chance during an introductory course I took because I remembered dimly that I liked biology in high school. I never regretted it. Synthetic biology is for me the opportunity to design complex systems using the strengths of life to create devices that ""traditionnal"" engineering can not. It is also the perfect time to work with a team with all kinds of backgrounds.
Oleg Mikhajlov
1st Year, Engineer, Ecole des Mines ParisTech
I'm a first year student at Ecole des Mines de Paris. Before that I studied at the physics faculty of Saint Petersburg State University, Russia. Now I would like to see how physics works in biology. Synthetic biology seems to be an excellent example of the interdisciplinary science that regroups biology, physics, computer sciences etc. That's why I joined the iGEM team.
The supervision team
Ariel Lindner
PhD, Researcher (Inserm)
INSERM tenured senior researcher and co-director of the AIV master, has graduated from the Hebrew University (Jerusalem, Israel) ""Amirim"" interdisciplinary program with major in Chemistry and received his M.Sc. and Ph.D. from the Weizmann Institute of Science (Rehovot, Israel) in Chemical Immunology for his work on catalytic antibodies as enzyme models, antibody conformational changes and directed evolution.

Antoine Decrulle
Master 2, Interdisciplinary approaches to Life Sciences (AIV),
Currently in Master 2 and preparing a thesis, i was in the team  Paris-Liliane Bettencourt during the last edition of the iGEM  competition. For me, it has been a great scientific and human  experience. This year I decided to be part of the new team as  advisor in order to share my experience and to keep learning  from the student and the new project.
Aleksandra Nivina
5th year, Pharmacy, Paris Descartes University
I discovered the iGEM competition one year ago, and  committed myself to this scientific adventure by joining the 2010  team. Having learned a lot during this intense and exciting  work, I would now like to share my knowledge and experience  with the members of the next team. I'm sure this collaboration  will be interesting and fruitful for both me and the new iGEMers.

4th year, Pharmacy, Paris 11 University
Last year, I participated to the iGEM competition as a student,  this experience was incredibly exciting and instructive.  However, building a project from its imagination to its design,  modeling and achievement at the bench is not an easy task…  That’s why I would like to share my experience and help the  new iGEM team to go as far as they can!
Thomas Lombès
3rd Year PhD at FdV
Last year’s iGEM competition was for me, as an advisor, a great  human and scientific experience. I am already thrilled by the  brainstorming sessions we have for the 2011 iGEM edition. I will  be glad to share my experience and help the new iGEM team  as much as I can.
Yifan Yang
1st year PhD at Frontiers of Life (FdV)
Naturally, I would be glad to contribute my experience in  previous iGEMs to the current team. Besides the science side,  I'm very interested in teaching science with research, and  untraditional mode of scientific research. iGEM is the perfect  model of both of these. From the teaching side, I'm really  excited by the prospect of getting to know and working with  people from different backgrounds. In addition to that, iGEM is  an opportunity where interdisciplinary projects got done by  undergraduate students, which would never happen in  traditional scientific labs. It's exciting to participate in such  endeavors year after year.

Attributions & Contributions
We are hosted by the Centre de Recherche Interdisciplinaire at the laboratory Inserm U1001 under the supervision of Ariel Lindner. We have decided to split the roles in terms of tasks to be performed, thereafter is the list. A single student can be in different categories. He/she would then use his time accordingly.
Experimentator
There are the regular experimentators who spend most of their time on the bench while punctual experimentators are the rest of the team. The latter are the rest of the people  of the team that have/will be trained in all basic synthetic biology experiments in order to give a hand to the main ones if need be.
Modeling
There are no iGEM projects without some kind of modelling. It allows to predict the behavior of the system, allows to maybe foresee some of the problems that might otherwise be incomprehensible in vivo.  They also take in charge the characterization of future biobricks.
Communication
The students within this sub-team have taken charge of creating the wiki, contacting the sponsors as well as trying to provide the tools and the environment for optimal communication within the team. One must always remember that communicating allows for coordination.
Lab management
The students in charge of this are supposed to know all the security precautions and the functioning of the different machines and microscopes. They are the backbone of the team since they also make the media and the solutions necessary to perform the experiments. Last but not least, they make sure supplies never run out.
Side projects
A non mandatory work that two students of the team are working on. They will contribute to the team by adding some interesting new viewpoints.

Information & Material Sharing with other teams
Peking University is among the earliest ones to establish iGEM team in China, and we would like to share our experience and experiment materials with other teams. OUC-China iGEM team and Tsinghua_A iGEM team participate in this competition for the first time this year. We 3 teams have some online discussions, and a lot of information about iGEM 2011 competition and team organization affairs has been shared with these 2 new teams.
Besides,  we are very glad to have discussions with Yifan Yang at Peking University on  May 23rd, 2011. Yifan Yang was a member of 2007 iGEM Peking University  team and is currently an advisor of 2011 iGEM Paris_Bettencourt team. Ideas of  the two teams had been discussed and Yang also shared his current work on cell  aging.

Professor  Miha Mraz's visiting in Peking University
Professor Miha Mraz, one of the instructors  of 2010 iGEM Slovenia team from University of Ljubljana, visited Peking  University on June 17th, 2011. At the Center for Theoretical  Biology, he gave a talk on the introduction to Slovenia and University of  Ljubljana, the experience of previous iGEM Slovenia teams, and modeling and  bifurcation analysis of biological systems. Prof. Miha Mraz's visit has surely  promoted the link and communication between Slovenia team and Peking University  team.
 
iGEM CHINA Meetup 2011 Held in Hefei
Four team members of Peking_R team, along with the instructor Haoqian Zhang, attended iGEM 2011 China Meetup at University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) on July 30th-31st, 2011.        The Meetup invited several professors and graduate students to give us talks on current status, challenges and prospects of synthetic biology. Besides, each team gave a brief introduction to its project, and all the attendants participated into discussions and giving suggestions. Our instructor, Haoqian Zhang, gave a talk on forward and reverse engineering approaches in synthetic biology. Shuobing Chen, our team leader, gave a brief talk on our project, ""softcoding design in synthetic biology"".        After this two-day Meetup, we have learned a lot from other iGEM teams from China, and we hope we can have more discussions with them in the following summer!
 
 
the Online Video talk with Dr. Hoo from the University of Edinburgh
Dr. Linda Hoo from the University of Edinburgh interviewed Peking_R team on Aug. 10th. During this online video talk, Dr. Hu asked a few questions to each of our team members relating to the construction, operation and division of work of our team. We hope this talk could help  promote the communication between Peking_R team and Edinburgh team!

Professor  Miha Mraz's visit in Peking
Professor Miha Mraz, one of the instructors  of 2010 iGEM Slovenia team from University of Ljubljana, visited Peking  University on June 17th, 2011. At the Center for Theoretical  Biology, He gave a talk on the introduction to Slovenia and University of  Ljubljana, the experience of previous iGEM Slovenia teams, and modeling and  bifurcation analysis of biological systems. Prof. Miha Mraz’s visit has surely  promoted the link and communication between Slovenia team and Peking University  team.
 
IGEM CHINA 2011 Held in Hefei
Four team members of Peking_R team, along with the instructor Haoqian Zhang, attended iGEM 2011 China Meetup at University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) on July 30th-31st, 2011.        The Meetup invited several professors and graduate students to give us talks on current status, challenges and prospects of synthetic biology. Besides, each team gave a brief introduction to its project, and all the attendants participated into discussions and giving suggestions. Our instructor, Haoqian Zhang, gave a talk on forward and reverse engineering approaches in synthetic biology. Shuobing Chen, our team leader, gave a brief talk on our project, softcoding design in synthetic biology.        After this two-day Meetup, we have learned a lot from other iGEM teams from China, and we hope we can have more discussions with them in the following summer!
 
 
the Online Video talkwith Dr. Hu from the University of Edinburgh
Dr. Linda Hu from the University of Edinburgh interviewed Peking_R team on Aug. 10th. During this online video talk, Dr. Hu asked a few questions to each of our team members relating to the construction, operation and division of work of our team. We hope this talk could help  promote the communication between Peking_R team and Edinburgh team!

Biodecontamination  Kit
We've developed a strategy for heavy metal bioreporter and bioabsorbent engineering, based on reverse engineering principle, which will help us to break the limitation of our current knowledge and research method. As MerR family TFs share highly conserved homology and most kinds of heavy metals have corresponding MerR family TFs(Brown et al., 2003; Hobman, 2007; Hobman et al., 2005; Julian et al., 2009), we can state that we have developed an extensible method to construct heavy metal decontamination kits composed of valid bioreporters and bioabsorbents for field application in the near future.

Conditioned Reflex Mimicking in E.coli
We are engineering our E.coli cells to process the correlation information of two environmental signal, similar to the process of classical conditioning in higher organisms. In our circuits we use a bistable switch as the memory module to represent the memory state; we also constructed a series of AND gates which can sense conditioned and unconditioned signals, and output a repressor protein to change the memory state of the bistable switch. In this way, our E.coli cells can convert the information on the concurrence of two signals to its memory. After the memory module is switched, given the conditioned stimulus, E.coli will activate its reporter module and thus exhibit the ""conditioned response"".

A Genetic Circuit for Directed Evolution in vivo
Directed evolution is a powerful tool for answering scientific questions or constructing novel biological systems. Here we present a simple genetic circuit for in vivo directed evolution which comprises minimal elements for random mutation and artificial selection. We engineer yeast to generate the DNA mutator hAID, an essential protein in adaptive immunity, and target it specifically to a gene of interest. The target gene will be mutated and consequently promptly evolves. By linking the expression of hAID repressor LacI and favorite gene functionality, the mutation rate inversely correlates between the functionality of the desired gene and hAID. This circuit may be adopted for in vivo evolution in eukaryotic system on genetically encoded targets. It has a variety of potential applications in academic and industrial contexts, theoretically most inter-molecular interaction that involves proteins and RNAs.

Towards Self-differentiated Bacterial Assembly Line
Our projects concern with the ability for bacterial cells to differentiate out of homogeneous conditions into populations with the division of labor. We aim at devices conferring host cells with the ability to form cooperating groups spontaneously and to take consecutive steps sequentially even when the genetic background and environmental inputs are identical. To break the mirror in such homogeneous condition, we need two devices respectively responsible for temporal and spatial differentiation. The implementation and application of such devices will lead to bioengineering where complex programs consisted of sequential steps (structure oriented programs) and cooperating agencies (forked instances of a single class, object and event oriented) can be embedded in a single genome. Although this ""differentiation"" process resemble the development of multicellular organism, we tend to use a more bioengineering style analogy: assembly line. Or maybe after some years from now, this will not be just an analogy.

Biodecontamination  Kit
We've developed a strategy for heavy metal bioreporter and bioabsorbent engineering, based on reverse engineering principle, which will help us to break the limitation of our current knowledge and research method. As MerR family TFs share highly conserved homology and most kinds of heavy metals have corresponding MerR family TFs(Brown et al., 2003; Hobman, 2007; Hobman et al., 2005; Julian et al., 2009), we can state that we have developed an extensible method to construct heavy metal decontamination kits composed of valid bioreporters and bioabsorbents for field application in the near future.

Jenny Cheng
is a recent graduate of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, currently working at Ginkgo Bioworks. She received her Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science in June of 2011. Jenny decided to  join the iGEM team to gain further experience in synthetic biology after becoming interested in the  subject while working as an undergraduate researcher under Peter Carr. She looks forward to being able to continue to  combine her solid computer science skills with her lab experience to solve  biological problems through iGEM. In her free time, Jenny enjoys  video game design and animation and has worked in the Singapore-  MIT GAMBIT Game Lab where she was part of a team that created  the game Phorm. She also likes to travel and is fluent in both English  and Mandarin Chinese. Last summer, she taught computer science  to students in Jerusalem as part of the Middle East  Education through Technology (MEET) Program.
Charles Hsu
is a sophomore studying biology at MIT. Charles decided to participate in iGEM because he felt it would be an excellent  opportunity to explore the manipulation of fundamental  principles of life to engineer innovative solutions to challenging problems. He hopes to use the  leadership and technical skills he gains from iGEM to help him in his aspiration of becoming a  clinical physician. Charles has previous lab experience from working at the  National Yang-Ming Medical University Department of  Physiology Clinical Medicine Core Lab. While there, he  researched the effect of anti- inflammatory chemicals on  the recovery rate of wounded alveolar epithelial cells and  designed a new error-minimizing measurement technique utilizing  basic geometry software.  Outside the lab, Charles spends his free time leading the  MIT Freshman Heavyweight Crew as a  coxswain. Charles is also an Eagle Scout studies  viola and chamber music with Professor Marcus Thompson.
Michelle Dion
is a rising junior pursuing a degree in chemical-biological engineering with a minor in  literature. Michelle decided to participate in iGEM because she felt it was an ideal opportunity to utilize  her knowledge of engineering and of biology to design and implement an innovative synthetic biology  project in a team environment. Her interest in iGEM and synthetic  biology stems from her belief that, as an athlete and MIT student,  no one should be kept from pursuing their passions by physical  limitations, such as disease or disability. She hopes in the future to  be able to pursue a career in either medicine or biological  engineering in which she is able to use synthetic biology to  improve the lives of people suffering from chronic diseases.   Michelle also looks forward to gaining extensive experience in a  lab environment through iGEM as well. When not in lab, Michelle  is a starter for both the MIT Varsity Field Hockey and the MIT  Varsity Softball teams, where she has been a two-time NEWMAC  Academic All Conference selection. She also spends time  volunteering in the greater Boston area as a tutor for Tutors for All,  a program dedicated to providing one-on-one instruction to  students in underserved urban schools.
Divya Arcot
is pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Biological Engineering as a member of the  Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s Class of 2014. Divya decided to participate in iGEM because she  believed it would give her an unparalleled insight into the field of  synthetic biology and the ways in which she could apply it to use in  solving problems in immunology, an area in which she is extremely  passionate about. Outside of biology, Divya’s interests include  aerospace and space exploration. She is a member of the executive  board of MIT Students for the Exploration and Development of Space  where she serves as publicity chair. Divya also interned at the NASA  Johnson Space Center where she created the infrastructure for an  Asbestos Exposure Assessment Database, which compiles hazardous  material exposure data into a well-organized format for NASA, OSHA,  and the EPA. Divya was the 2010 National Winner of the National  Center for Women and Information Technology Award for Aspirations  in Computing and the Colorado State Winner and National Finalist for  the Daughters of the American Revolution Good Citizen Award.
Clara Park
is a rising sophomore pursuing a degree in Biological Engineering. Clara became  interested in iGEM because she enjoys the way in which synthetic biology is a dynamic, interactive field  with infinite potential to be able to solve global issues. She was also excited to join iGEM because she  felt it was one of the very rare opportunities that she would get to build something out of her  imagination with minimal restrictions. Clara hopes to use iGEM to gain  skills to build a foundation for her future career in synthetic biology.  Outside of iGEM, Clara’s research experience includes being a research  assistant in OLED Research at Hongik University in Korea where she  developed a theoretical model for view angle dependent emission  pattern of OLEDs and was a second author of a thesis published in  Journal of Korean Institute of Electrical and Electronic Materials  Engineers (KIEEME). Clara also has a patent under examination in Korea  for a travel carrier that resembles a drawer to facilitate the process of  packing. Clara won the Kyungki State government Global Leadership  Award and the Taiwan Ministry of Education International Intelligent  Creativity Contest, both in 2009.
Jonathan Chien
is a rising sophomore at MIT, studying Biological  Engineering. He’s participating in iGEM because he’s fascinated by the  idea of manipulating and programming biological life as a system of  circuits.  Prevous to iGEM, he’s worked in a biochemistry laboratory,  purifying enzymes and synthesizing deuterated RNA for structure analysis  and has also had programming experience. In his free time, he serves as a  Tour Guide, Treasurer for the MIT 2014 Class Council, and Vice-President  of his fraternity. After graduation, he hopes to work at a local  biotechnology company.
Grant Robinson
is a rising junior at MIT, studying Biological Engineering. He was a member of MIT’s  2010 iGEM team and is back because he really enjoyed the pairing of a  group collaborative and friendly atmosphere with intense novel  research last summer.

In the 2011 China Meetup @USTC, about 20 teams from China mainland and Taiwan District got together to share and discuss projects and new ideas. We could see different perspectives of synthetic biology through varied projects.
From Ribo/toggle switch to condon optimum, from chemotaxis to quorum system, from pollution control to construction of functional modules, the enthusiasm from youth and creativity from undergraduates filled the auditorium with joy and wisdom.
iGEM always encourage cooperation and collaborations between universities for better scientific communication and deeper comprehension of Synthetic Biology. This year, our university agreed on helping NYMU with the plasmid transformation and growth curve measurement. This cooperation would bring mutual benefits to both our universities, not only for academic research, but also for the long lasting friendship.

Overview | Biobricks | Source Code | Acknowledgments | Accomplishments
Team Acknowledgments
Our project was selected from a pool of many possible project ideas submitted by both team members and advisers. Team members decided to focus on zinc finger proteins because of the technologies (chip DNA synthesis and MAGE) available to us: we believed that developing new zinc finger proteins was a way to use both technologies to their greatest possible extent. This project was not an extension or a continuation of any existing work on zinc fingers, in the Church lab or otherwise. The original idea of zinc finger proteins was contributed by the Harvard iGEM 2011 advisors and mentors, including but not limited to, Jagesh Shah, Srivatsan Raman, Daniel Goodman, Noah Taylor, Jameson Rogers, Joyce Yang, and Jun Li.
This project was made possible by support from Dr. George Church's lab at the Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering as well as Alain Viel at the Harvard Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology.  Without their valuable guidance and great patience, we never would have been able to achieve what have done so far. While our teaching fellows - members of the Church Lab - gave us many opportunities, they also made sure that we achieved our goals and results entirely via our own work: our teaching fellows provided inspiration, team members achieved what we did through our own perspiration.
Although the project is the first to combine several key technologies in novel ways, these technologies were developed outside of Harvard iGEM.  The multiplex automated genome engineering (MAGE) method was developed by Harris Wang et al [2] .  Chip-based DNA synthesis method was developed by Sri Kosuri et al [1] , and the actual oligo synthesis was generously provided by Agilent Technologies, a sponsor of iGEM. Lambda red was originally developed by Yu et al [3] . We would like to make it clear that we do not claim any credit whatsoever for the creation of the technologies used in this project. Our project and Foundational Advance proposal rest on our successful use of and novel integration of these multiple technologies in concert, and subsequent application of this system to generate novel zinc finger proteins as a proof of concept.
We owe great thanks to Alain Viel for his flawless management of the logistics of iGEM, including but not limited to providing lab space, ordering lab supplies when we needed them, arranging our trip to the Americas Regional and World Jamborees, and for his excellent taste in footwear. Furthermore, we would also like to thank our lab manager Andrew Cumming for all of his practical lab advice and for helping to make everything run smoothly in the day to day logistics of lab.
Jagesh Shah provided us with excellent advice on both our project and the iGEM competition as a whole: what to expect, how to improve our presentation, and not to take ourselves too seriously. We also owe Jagesh's children Harvard iGEM t-shirts for depriving them of Jagesh's company when several of our meetings ran late into the night.

TEAM
Our team is composed of students from ENSPS School. Initially, the project was carried out by a team of 6 students, but some of them have left the project in May. The team has so been restructured, and after discussions we have decided to continue the project, even with a small team. Indeed, the interest in presenting a project to iGEM competition, to be innovative in an emerging field like synthetic biology is a great experience, and the rest of the team is excited to finish the accomplished work, and to have the best results.
The team is so composed of only two students, advised by professors and doctors from the microelectronics laboratory InESS, and also by the biology professor J.Haeich, for the Strasburg faculty of Medicine.
Undergraduates:
Martin Andraud
Martin Andraud started studying electronics for his Baccalauréat in 2006. After a technician diploma in electronic systems in 2008, he did a preparatory course so as to integrate ENSPS in 2009. Here, after choosing the microelectronics course, he is now interested in applying electronics to live sciences (medicine, biotechnologies). This project is so a way for him to put his knowledge in electronics into an emerging research field, synthetic biology, and apply it to a new approach of merging those two sciences.
Vincent Wlotzko
Vincent Wlotzko has studied mathematics and physics, for his baccalauréat in 2007, and his two years preparatory course so as to enter at ENSPS in 2009. For the continuation of his course, he has chosen a specialization in micro and nano electronics, and the “bio-systems” module is a way for him to extend his electronics skills to a living science field, to develop a new idea of applying microelectronics to synthetic biology, and also give new possibilities, between those two fields.
Advisor:
Pr. Jacques Haeich
Jacques Haiech got a M.D. degree in Mathematics and computer science in 1975 and then a M.D. and a PhD degree in Biochemistry in 1978 dealing with cell signaling (focusing on calcium signal in muscle cells). After his PhD, he has been working part time successively at NCI in Bethesda, then at Vanderbilt University and finally at Northwestern University (Chicago) while being research director at “Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique” in France, studiyng cellular calcium signals before joining the Strasbourg University as a full professor in 1997. He has founded the first synthetic biology option in an engineering school in France in 2008 along with the first participation of the ESBS-Team to the iGEM competition. Since then, he has developed collaboration with the Strasbourg engineering school of physics on “Design Methodology and Modeling of Synthetic Biosystems”. He is now working in integrating concepts of synthetic biology in personalized medicine.
Instructors
Yves Gendrault
After obtaining his bachelor's degree in Electronique, Signaux et Automatique (ESA), Yves does a Master’s degree in Micro-and Nano-Electronique (MNE) at the Université de Strasbourg (UdS). He discovers the field of Synthetic Biology during an internship in the Institut d'Electronique du Solide et des Systèmes (InESS) laboratory in Strasbourg. During this internship he creates models for several biological processes. Because Synthetic Biology is situated between engineer sciences and biotechnologies, the collaboration with biotechnologists is for him fundamental for a better understanding. In this way, he has started his Ph.D program, untitled “standardization of the design flow for synthetic biology”.
Yves has already participated to iGEM competition, with the ESBS team in 2010.
Pr. Christophe LALLEMENT
Christophe Lallement received the M.S. degree in engineering from the Science University of Nancy I, Nancy, France, and the Ph.D. degree in engineering from the École Nationale Supérieure des Télecommunications, Paris, France. From November 1994 to September 1997, he was a Postdoctoral Research Scientist with the Laboratory of Electronics, Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne (EPFL), Lausanne, Switzerland, working on the characterization and modeling of the metal-oxide-semiconductor field effect transistor (MOSFET) in the development team of the Enz-Krummenacher-Vittoz MOSFET model. In September 1997, he was an Associate Professor with the Université de Strasbourg (UdS), Strasbourg, France, and the Laboratory for Physics and Applications of Semiconductors, Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique. Since September 2003, he has been a Professor with the École Nationale Supérieure de Physique de Strasbourg, Illkirch, France. He is currently with the Institut d’Électronique du Solide et des Systèmes (InESS), UdS, working on the study and the modeling of advanced devices, very-high-speed integrated-circuit hardware description language analog and mixed-signal systems, and biosynthetic systems. He is the responsible for the group “Integrated Instrumental Systems” at InESS.
Dr Morgan MADEC
Morgan Madec was born in 1980. He received the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in microelectronics from the University Louis Pasteur (ULP), Strasbourg, France, in 2003 and 2006 respectively. From 2003 to 2006, he was with the Laboratoire de Physique et Application des Semi-Conducteurs (PHASE), ULP Centre National de Recherches Scientifiques, Strasbourg, where he prepared a Ph.D. thesis on the design, the simulation and the characterization of optical processors in order to speed up image reconstruction in the medical field.  He is currently a Professor Associate with the Institut d’Électronique du Solide et des Systèmes, Université de Strasbourg, Strasbourg and teaches electronics in the Ecole Nationale Supérieure de Physique de Strasbourg, University of Strasbourg. His research interests include compact modeling of integrated microsensors (Hall-effect sensor, photodiode ...). Since 2008, he collaborates with a team of the Laboratoire d’Innovation Therapeutique. The aim of this work is to put the experience in microelectronics system design to good use in synthetic biology.
ENSPS
The ENSPS (Ecole Nationale Supérieure de Physique de Strasbourg) is a French graduate engineering school. It is a part of the internationally recognized Strasbourg University (UDS). The school is located in the golden triangle of European research bounded by Alsace, Baden-Wurtemberg and Switzerland in which can be found a major part of the scientific potential of Europe. Rich in high-tech industries, this border region has developed its own international technological-exchanges. Since its foundation in 1970, research training has been a strong tradition at ENSPS through its partnerships with a number of UDS and CNRS  (Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique) research laboratories.  Among the different courses offered by the school, a micro and nano electronics specialization is possible during the last year of the engineering degree. As the school is also turn towards live sciences, optional modules of this course enables students to see microelectronics applied to  live sciences. One of the optional modules of this course is called “synthetic biology”, and is aimed at making links between the emerging synthetic biology field and microelectronics. In this way, basic biology knowledge is provided to the students, and a project is settled so as to familiarize students with synthetic biology. The last part of this course is dedicated to make a project, and participate to the iGEM competition.
Strasbourg University
European by nature and international by design, the University's strengths and assets stem from its active involvement in virtually every discipline comprising the current body of knowledge. As a young university founded on an age-old tradition, it strives to attain cross-disciplinarily so that this mixing fosters new research opportunities and produces courses that meet society's need. The international dimension is fundamental for the University of Strasbourg and thanks to the worldwide reputation of its research teams, built on excellence and efficiency; it emerges among Europe's foremost research universities. Each of the University's main academic fields of instruction is based upon research sections that are the driving force of the institution, with over 2,600 professors and 2,000 staff. The Technology Transfer Office, one of the very first developed in a French university, strives to promote the work of the researchers and facilitate partnerships with economic and institutional stakeholders. An essential player in the promotion of scientific and technical culture, the University interfaces with its host city, Strasbourg. Solidly anchored in the European Higher Education Area, the University of Strasbourg, a beating heart of the Alsatian metropolis with its 41,000 students, has the potential to face the challenging international competition.

Because of the restructuration of the team, it was a great challenge to have all the iGEM requirements, but because we cannot cut ourselves in 4 people, the task repartition was easier to do! This fact explained the lenght of this part...
Behavioral
The behavioral version of the software was developed by the students:
The whole team has worked to have VHDL models, validated by the instructors, then students have realized the file generation part in C++, the GUI, and have integrated the file generation into the GUI to have a complete program.
Conservative
Concerning the conservative version, the instructiors have created the VHDL-AMS models, because of the specificities of the VHDL-AMS language, and the team has then integrated those models into the software, helped mainly by Yves Gendrault.

The original team was no more than a group of friends looking for an original idea about synthetic biology, but as this idea grew and took shape, it was clear that it could perfectly fit this competition. So the team recruited some other acquaintances and people interested in the project: biologists, biochemists, biotechnologists, computer engineers and advisors joined the group to build the definitive Arcanum Project Team.
If you want to know more about us, just click on one category and then on the name or the photo and you'll see a personal description of that member of the team!
STUDENTS
Álvaro Adame
Biology Student
Oh my garden!
When I was at school I loved drawing cells and all their content, as another world that works thanks to a perfect communication between its elements. At high-school I fall in love with the DNA and I still remember that weekend I spent studying how bacteria exchange their genes.
I really want to know more about wet lab and the way we use the different techniques in researching. And I found the great opportunity of developing our own project and our ideas.  We can’t miss that chance. I´ve always said that just spend two months in the lab, solving the problems by ourselves, would be very satisfactory. I hope it will be a great experience and we could learn a lot doing real science.
Pablo Camino
Computer Science Student
“I´m in Brighton”
I have never had clear my vocation, because I always wanted to know as much as possible about everything around me. Finally, I decided to satisfy my curiosity about how the machines work, so I immersed myself in the computer science world.
When I heard about this project I was very interested in being part of this research, that I consider as important as attractive. Despite of the fact that I came a little late, I have been working with the illusion of knowing that it goes into something big.
Inés García
Biotechnology Student
""Let´s buy cookies!""
My dream when I was a little girl was to become an astronaut and travel through outer space. Therefore, I am a clear example of EVOLUTION; but because I’m quite attached to my life here on Earth, I exchanged giant planets for minute bacteria. For as everybody knows, the best perfumes come in small bottles.
Evolution always leaves traces: I do sometimes have my head in the clouds, but I know I made the right decision. As a Biotechnology student I enjoy working with “small things” and I’m sure this will give me great satisfaction, both during this project and throughout the rest of my career.
Rocío Gaudioso
Biotechnology Student
""There's something with limbs here, I'm gonna call the police!""
If I hadn’t been able to study Biotechnology I would have had a serious problem, because I really can’t see myself researching anything else. I love what I do - or what I try to do - I should say, because it’s an extraordinary fusion of all the subjects I liked when I was child.
A biotechnologist can cut out, paste onto, turn over or colour anything in GFP green; but most importantly they know why they’re doing it. I don’t know what I’d like to be in the future, each year I discover a new branch of Biology that hooks me more than the previous one, so for now I’m just enjoying the lessons and the practical projects I’m involved in.
Andrés Gónzalez
Biochemistry Student
""HIP HIP!""
There were myriad reasons why I chose the degree I’m currently studying; and hope to finish soon. I’ve always liked to build new devices from simpler components. Actually, the fact that all my Lego, Kennex and Mecano pieces fell apart at the age when hair started to appear under my armpits, made me think I needed new, improved pieces to work with.
Getting involved in this project means having a great opportunity to “play” again and develop amazing constructions not only for me, but for everybody to enjoy them. Who knows? Maybe what we’re doing today will be useful tomorrow for somebody to create even bigger, more complex biological machines. Working with such components might lead me to reconsider a thought I used to have: studying some kind of engineering. But that, apart from studying Physics and Chemistry before, will happen only if I win the lottery, or maybe if some great gentle patron contacts me thanks to this project... :)
Roberto Martín
Computer Science Student
""I want my sticker!""
It wasn’t until I was teached by Mario Pérez in the subject Computation and Computability that I discovered the link between computer science and biology. The last part of the subjet was about natural computing, the introduction of a genetic algorithm, neural networks and p-system. Since then, I’m sure that the future of computation lies in biology, so I asked my teacher for further information. And now I’m here, getting involved in this interesting project, of which I expect I can learn a lot about both biology and computation.
But... what about me? I am a creative, curious person, who likes web projects and getting results. If you want to know more about me, follow me!
Elena Moreno
Biotechnology Student
”Not only I´m PERFECT but I´m BLOND too”
Though I’ve always been considered a “science girl”, I can’t say my vocation was always Biotechnology. Actually, I didn’t even know of its existence until a year before starting the degree. Undecided between languages, medicine or maths, I eventually chose this new degree, which was apparently challenging and promised lots of further opportunities for research.
And what a great discovery! I can’t help but admire how all the different scientific branches intertwine, right down to the deepest element to form a whole that works just like a programmed clock. I was far from imagining to what extent we have managed to gain control over nature on so many levels, especially taking into account how unpredictable, and downright powerful Mother Nature still proves to be. And what’s better is how fascinating and erratic she is even nowadays. As each new year in my degree goes by I keep changing mind about what to do in the future; I guess I may have to keep studying for the rest of my life...

""Dude, things are going too well, something bad is going to happen soon""
Unlike the majority of the group, I’m studying Information Technology at the University of Seville, though when I came to make the final choice I was in serious doubt over which degree to do as Biology, Maths and Chemistry were also extremely appealing to me. So, when Pedro called me that evening to meet up and talk about the project they were involved with, I had no option but to give a categorical YES to his proposal of joining them.
In the three or four months since I’ve learnt so much about different fields of Biology, such as Genetic Regulation; about management and about people that I otherwise wouldn’t have known. If participants are from the field of biology, they’ll find enterprising people with original ideas. Equally, if they’re from another specialism, they’ll benefit from teaming up with Biologists: if there’s one good thing about Synthetic Biology it is the fact that any project needs people from several disciplines. Four pairs of eyes can see better than two, especially if they are looking from different perspectives.

""Where are the damned scissors?!?""
I have loved science since I was a little girl; maybe the documentaries I watched with my mother had something to do with my passion. I was much older when I went to a conference about embryonic stem cells which featured Bernat Soria - a famous Spanish expert in stem cells – talking about their use for the treatment of diabetes, and at that moment I decided that I wanted to devote myself to the study of the smallest and most complex mechanisms found in life.
When I think that all  the living organisms that surround us have appeared because of thousands of years of evolution I can’t help feeling dizzy. And there are still so many things left to understand and discover that we will never finish learning. That’s why synthetic biology  is so awesome.. I am very proud to be able to contribute to the improvement of technology and further our knowledge in this field.
Carlos Toscano
Biology Student
“That´s perturbingly demoniac”
Long ago I started university studying one of my other great passions: Mathematics. For some reason I decided to change my degree and nowadays I’m somewhere between the fourth and the fifth year of a/my Biology degree, and about to finish.
From the very moment I began the degree I’ve thought about possible biotechnology projects which could help solve some of our species’ problems and recently I’ve realised that my mind is actually always working on the code of synthetic biology. So, I find it amazing to have this opportunity to participate in iGEM 2011, where we’ll show everybody there’s still such a lot to do. My favourite part of the about the Ubbit Standard project  is the theoretical development of the basis of the standard, and the rules governing the new levels of abstraction. I think the Ubbit Standard has a promising future far beyond the contest and we will be able to promote it as it deserves.
Pedro Victori
Biology Student
”This is not noble at all”
One of the things I like the most about biology is how incredibly complex it is. And I don’t mean complex as in difficult to understand, but as in how vast the subject is. I’ve often thought how fascinating it must have been to be a scientist 100 years ago, or even 50 years ago, when all the great findings we now take for granted were still undiscovered. Even though we’re clarifying our basis of knowledge little by little - which means becoming more and more specialized - biology still offers a huge amount of challenges to undertake. I think that’s the reason I know researching biology is my vocation, the sheer size of the subject matter and something which occurred naturally – by chance - on our planet.

I’m currently studying Biochemistry at the Faculty of Biology in the University of Seville, after having completed the first three years of a biology degree.

""Please, don't tell me to go to the lab from one day to the next""
I have been interested in life sciences since I was a little child, when I used to bring home every small living creature that I found in the playground. My mother was not so happy about these adventures, but someway I managed to study Biochemistry and I got more and more interested in laboratory research. So I packed my things and went to the North of the world, to Norway, and did my PhD on human misfolding diseases. At the moment I am a postdoctoral research fellow at the Biomedicine Institute (IBiS) in Seville, Spain, working on synaptic transmission of the nervous system in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. You see? Still taking care of the small creatures of the world (both the worms and the students).

""Have you come to steal more materials from my lab?""
Since I first set foot in a laboratory, I have been cutting and pasting DNAs, doing what had always been called “molecular biology”… and a few months ago a couple of students came to my lab and told me that they would like to “copy&paste” DNAs with direction, that they intended to create things that don't exist in any living being, that they would like to do “synthetic biology” in order to participate in a competition, which was unknown to me at that time, the iGEM. I haven't been able to get iGEM out of my life since then, but most importantly, only good things have happened to these and the other students of the team: interviews in the newspapers and in the national TV; meetings with very important people (vice-deans, minister of science, directors of scientific agencies...). And, of course, hard work in the lab during three months. I have only one thing to say: I am proud of these students, for what they have got and done and for what they will be able to get and do.

Hello! My name is Curro. I´m 22 years old and I´m Sevillian. I have a very busy life dedicated to looking for the sense of this thing we call life, and I believe I´ll never get to know it. But meanwhile, if some day you want to achieve your objective, don´t let the candel of hope fall from your hand.

I never thought I would pass my summertime in a lab nor that I would enjoy these months as I have! My cat friends think I´m crazy, but I´m a very lucky cat. Not only for being golden or getting everything I want, but for being the oficial mascot of Arcanum Project. Althought they didn´t feed me very much (I´ve lost some weight during the last few months)I know I have been a very important part of the team this summer. LET´S GO ARCANUM!!!

""I don't always clone (that's actually not true) but when I do, I prefer BrickMason!""  Dan Jedrysiak
uOttawa 2011 iGEM Team
Instructors
Dan Jedrysiak
I am in the second year of my Master's program in Cellular and Molecular Medicine. I have been involved in iGEM as an undergraduate since 2008 and this year I am participating as an instructor. I don't always clone (that's actually not true) but when I do, I prefer BrickMason!
Alex Power
I am currently doing my Master's in Cellular and Molecular Medicine, and have been a member of the University of Ottawa iGEM team since 2009. I may not be as handsome as Dan Jedrysiak but I've still tried to be as valuable to the team as possible. We have a great project this year and I am impressed with the effort that all the team members put forth. I considered writting something about myself, like my hobbies, then I realized that I don't have any hobbies. I do, however, love synthetic biology and look forward to leveraging this love to build a billion-dollar biotech empire, or at least find interesting employment as a scientist.
Undergrads
Afnan Azizi
I'm entering my last year of studies in Honours BSc with Specialization in Biochemistry. I've had the privilege of being a part of the iGEM team for three years now, although due to some technical issues this is the first time I actually get to go to a Jamboree. As someone who's done both wet lab research last year and administrative tasks, as the co-president, this year, I can tell for a fact that the lab work is a lot more fun. At any rate, iGEM is fun in all its aspect and I am very pleased to be a part of this great community.
Kyle Hinskens
I am currently entering my second year in Software Engineering and I felt I needed to get involved with something. Participating in iGEM for the first time this summer has been an interesting experience. I may not know too much about synthetic biology, but I did learn quite a bit about designing a website inside a MediaWiki template. Just because the members of this team are epic cool, this country geek is looking forward to working alongside them next year as well!
Bushra Khan
This fall, I’ll be starting my 3rd year of an Honours BSc. in Biomedical Science with a Minor in English Literature. I’m incredibly excited to be a part of the uOttawa iGEM team as it amalgamates my love for biology and the real-world applications of science. With a few years of research experience under my belt and a past history as a competitive public speaker, iGEM and I are a great fit as it caters to my need to learn new things and to be heard! This year, I will be assisting the team by writing the human practices essay and getting some awesome t-shirts for us to showcase at the jamborees!
Wilson Lam
In the fall of 2011, I will be going into my second year of undergraduate studies of Honours Specialization in Biochemistry. This past summer has been my first year as a member of the uOttawa iGEM team, as a wet lab worker. iGEM has proven simply to be an amazing experience, by being a method of learning outside of the normal textbook or lecture-based education that we are all so familiar with. Aside from science, I spend my time making music, breakdancing, and enjoying a night out every so often...Oh, and you can catch me on Youtube at 1MaginAZN!
Simon Laplante
Student at uOttawa going to 3rd year Biochemistry.
Simon is the French guy in the team. He collaborates and collaborated with sponsors to help find sponsorship such as reagents to minimize the costs and to help the project move forward. He is also helping the team to find new ideas such as website design and look. He enjoys cycling hundreds of kilometers a week and he has a lot of laboratory experience already having begun doing research before entering university.
Fangshi Lu
3rd Year Biomedical Sciences
I helped in fundraising as well as logistics, and will be back in the fall to help out with posters and other various things.
I'm fairly new to the team, but I have confidence that this year's turnout will keep up the tremendous work that has preceeded us. So excited for this year's competition! :)
Matthew Orton
I am currently entering my fifth year of Biopharmaceutical Science with an option in Genomics. This is my fourth summer as a member of the uOttawa iGEM Team and since I am now a Co-President, my role on the team is wide ranging, from fundraising to wet lab work to administrative duties. I think what keeps me so engaged in iGEM is its interdisciplinary nature and the opportunity to be creative and innovative in a research environment. Other interests include running, reading and gaming. I really think the uOttawa Team has something truly exceptional and awesome to contribute to the competition this year and I can’t wait for the jamboree(s)!
Richard Robbins
This semester I'll be entering my 3rd year of a B.Sc Honours in Computer Science, with a minor in physics.
This is my first year contributing to the uOttawa iGem team, which has given me an excellent opportunity to gain some interdisciplinary experience. Looking forward to the jamboree and coming back next year!
Kuba Rogowski
3rd year Honours BSc with Specialization in Biology
Graphic design and logistical support
This is my second year contributing to the uOttawa iGEM team and I'm looking forward to my first Jamboree!
Ian Roney
Ian is currently entering his 3rd year of biomedical sciences. His ability to understand obscure references is simply amazing. But do not let that innocent face fool you: underneath lies a relentless wit of sarcasm. Although this is only his first year as a part of iGEM, Ian has made a significant contribution to the team from wet lab work to fundraising to providing great ideas and being hilarious. Ian is quite ecstatic to go to the jamborees.
Jaclynn D. Smith
Currently heading into my 3rd year of a B.Sc. with specialization in Psychology
Role: Part of the administrative team!
I'm super excited to be attending my first Jamboree this year as I have been admiring the uOttawa iGEM team from afar for a few years and have finally gotten involved with the team this year!
Daniel St. Jules
20 year old programmer and designer. Going into 3rd year Honours B.Sc. with Specialization in Computer Science.
Though it's my first year participating in iGem, I'm hoping it won't be my last. Can't wait for the jamboree too!
Zuhair Syed
Zuhair is entering his third year of biomedical sciences with a  minor in math.
Zuhair's role on the team is to supply us with an endless amount of family guy references, super hero movie reviews and bash apple for everything they have ever made. This is Zuhair's first year on the iGEM team and he has worked tremendously hard in the lab this summer. He will be one of our presenters at the Jamboree(s).
Naveen Venayak
5th year Biotechnology (B.Sc. Honours Biochemistry and B.A.Sc. Chemical Engineering)
I've always been interested in biochemistry and engineering and systems biology allows me to apply my two interests simultaneously. iGEM is a great way for me explore systems biology with my peers.

Wet lab work
The undergraduates Matt Orton, Ian Roney, Wilson Lam and Zuhair Syed constructed and submitted all BioBrick parts created by the uOttawa Team. The two graduate students on the team, Alex Power and Dan Jedrysiak, assisted with project design, integration of BioBricks into S. cerevisiae and characterization of BioBricks by flow cytometry.
Dan Jedrysiak and Alex Power also developed and tested the new BioBrick assembly protocol. All parts submitted by the uOttawa Team were constructed using this method by the undergraduates mentioned above.
Our lab technician Mila Tepliakova assisted with day to day lab work and advice.
Our instructor Dr. Mads Kaern supplied the team with all lab related resources and assisted with project design.
Design
All aspects of the project related to artistic design including poster, wiki, presentation, brochure, and logo were created by many of the undergraduate students on the team without the use of third party designers.
Fundraising
All fundraising activities were performed exclusively by members of the team.
Financial and Administrative
The financial and administrative aspects of the project were carried out mainly by the undergraduates Afnan Azizi, Matt Orton and Jaclynn Smith.
Human Practices
The undergraduates Richard Robbins and Daniel St. Jules designed and programmed the game, ""Gears of Evolution"" for the human practices aspect of the project with science and art direction from Matt Orton, Afnan Azizi, Zuhair Syed and Ian Roney.
The undergraduate Bushra Khan wrote the essay entitled ""Why Society Worries - The Social Apprehension of Synthetic Biology"" for the human practices aspect of the project.
Wiki
The undergraduate Kyle Hinskens was in charge of web design for the wiki.

Who did what
The teams were assembled during our winter quarter. During this term, we went around to classes and had weekly meetings to introduce students to synthetic biology through a series of guest lectures. During the spring, students participated in brainstorming projects related to the sponsoring Faculty advisors' labs (Baker and Klavins) and came up with the project they wanted to carry out. Students also planned and participated in community outreach events where we taught the local public about synthetic biology. Over the summer, students completed all of the experimental work, but worked closely with both graduate students and faculty advisors to plan the most pertinent experiments and make the most of our limited time.
The work documented here in this wiki and on our presentation is entirely the work of iGEM students - it does not represent the project of any host lab, advisor, or instructor participating in iGEM.
Diesel Production
After producing promising results, in future directions:
Casey Ager, Austin Moon, and Seth Sagulo worked on Enzyme Localization via Direct Fusion and Zinc Finger Fusion methods.
Juhye An, Elaine Lai, and Benjamin Mo worked on Decarbonylase Redesign
Marika Cheng and Justin De Leon worked on Alternative Chassis
Chris Choe and David Zong worked on Alternate Aldehyde Production
Matthew Harger worked on Branched Alkanes Production
Matthew Harger and Lei Zheng worked on System Optimization
Emily Yang worked on modelling the alkane production pathway.
Gluten Destruction
Sydney Gordon, Daniel Hadidi, Liz Stanley, Angus Toland, Sarah Wolf, and Sean Wu designed, built, and tested Kumamolisin-As and over 100 mutants to combat gluten intolerance by increasing the activity on the PQLP antigenic peptide.
iGEM Toolkits
Michael Brasino, Rashmi Ravichandran, and Alicia Wong worked on extracting and BioBricking the essential genes for magnetosomes, made the fusion proteins, and did the experimental measurements.  They also expanded on work that was started by UW iGEM students in 2010, by constructing more Gibson-friendly plasmid backbones and characterizing the Gibson-assembly efficiencies of pSB and pGA plasmids.
Community Outreach
Cindy Wu headed and organized all iGEM 2011 Community Outreach events.

Americas Regional Jamboree
We had a lot of fun at the Americas Regional Jamboree! It was an action packed weekend filled with great talks, posters and people, and overall lots of thought-provoking science. It was amazing to see the diversity of projects presented, as well as the immense amount of work that was completed by all teams over the course of the summer. Many thanks to iGEM and IBE for hosting the jamboree, as well as to all of the judges and coordinators who put in so many volunteer hours. We are honored to have been chosen as the Americas Regional Grand Champion, and to have our enzyme, that we engineered to break down gluten, named Best New Part, Engineered. We look forward to the opportunity to meet again and experience more of the fantastic iGEM community.
After the Americas Regional Jamboree we were excited to tell the rest of our teammates about our experience, as only five of us were able to travel to Indianapolis. Thanks to Joe Oh at The Daily for this team picture.

Week 26
This week we discussed everyone's knowledge of the project so far using a compilation of pictures illustrating several parts of the project. Listing all open questions gave a nice overview of what still needs to be understood in more detail. At the same time we defined what experimental steps to take and made a rough cost-time estimate. Using this setup we went to work on the lab manuals. We also visited the kick-off meeting for ""Meeting of Minds"", where we met representatives of the ""young"" divisions of Hollands main political parties. In september we will hold a debate on Synthetic Biology with young scientists and politicians.
Week 22
This week was mainly research into the final systems we will use for localization and internal activation of Mfp-5. Building on the work of iGEM team Denmark 2010 we will use transmembrane Tar-receptors to form fusion proteins with Mfp-5 resulting in polar clusters of adhesiveness. Internal Tyrosine activation may be achieved easily within the cytoplasm, but periplasm would require use of the same Sec transporter as Mfp-5, possibly fused to TonB for inner membrane integration.
Also a modeling plan was set up, consisting of several parallel parts mainly aimed towards determining the thresholds of required binding strength, and the major factors affecting those thresholds.
Week 21
This week all literature had to be available on friday concerning localization of Mfp-5. The focus soon fixed to use of the polar clusters affecting the signaling pathway for flagellae. The transmembrane receptors may be a nice target. The sequence for cloning the BH4 pathway genes was constructed and reviewed by several advisors.

Week 26
This week we had a general scientific meeting to ensure the ""scientific gaps"" in our project. We listed all the questions which rised during this meeting, at the end we made a more detailed plan for the labwork. Afterwards Janneke, Carsten, Esmee and Tania worked on the lab manuals.  On wednesday we joined the kick off meeting ""Meeting of Minds"", organised by the Ratthenau institute. Their intention was to introduce synthetic biology to politicians. Therefore, we had a meeting with the young representives of the different poltical parties of the Netherlands. During this meeting we had several presentation about synthetic biology, the ideas of the Ratthenau institute for the Meeting of Minds, explanation og iGEM for the politicians etc. It was a very nice meeting and I think it is a very interesting oppertunity for our team to do a part for Human Practice! I'm looking forward to the further progress for this part. Beside meeting the politicians, we also had a drink with the other Dutch iGEM teams again. I liked the enthausiasm very much!
Week 23
This week I had a talk with Alessandro about setting deadline, was good! From now on I’ll be more strict on deadlines guys! Beside that we discussed also the modelling plan. On Tuesday till Thursday I worken in Zeeland, at my parents place…Since I have to baby sit the dog, I finished the planning and did research for modelling. Further I made a flow diagram for modelling and on Friday I had a meeting with Christian Picioreanu and Alessandro. Together we distinguished the several different modelling parts in the total idea. The total idea for modelling is very nice, but it’ll take lots of time and needs lots of more research. Enough to do for next week!
Week 22
This week I focused on making the general planning…I think it sometimes is rather difficult to plan everything, especially with everybody still having exams etc. Beside this Esmee and I discussed the collaboration with the science centre, what are the possibilities, what would we like to do? A lot is possible and we really like to collaborate with the science centre, also for human practice. Just before the weekend, Carsten and I made a plan for modelling, which we will discuss next week with our supervisor Alessandro, the king of modelling.
Week 21
This week we gave a lecture to all the professors about our project to gain usefull input. I was only present on Monday, since from Tuesday till Saturday I was allowed to do the business course of Heineken.
Week 20
This weekend was lots more busy then we thought. Everybody worked very hard for the OSLI sponsor application, put a lot of effort in it and just in time we were finished! I was very proud of the team, so on Monday we had a bubble wine to celebrate. For me this week was full with meetings with lots of people again. For example; Han de Winde, the head of the department of biotechnology, some professors, Hans Fraaije from University Leiden, Peter Post from TNO…I discussed a lot of different angles of incidence which all will contribute to our project!
Week 19
By doing a lot research, little meetings with experts (professors, companies, other universities etc) and a lot of discussions we finally decided the main parts of our project. A fundamental part, a optimization part and an application part. This was also chosen after we had a meeting with team about what we really expected during this project. It became clear that almost everybody expected something else from the project. Luckily there was a lot of overlap, and in the end we have a plan where everybody will satisfied and happy.  On Friday the team had a meeting in Amsterdam with all the iGEM teams of Holland, initiated by team Amsterdam. Everybody gave a little presentations, updated each other and of course there were some beers involved.  Unfortunately I could not be there, but I think it was a very good initiative!
Week 18
After a short meeting with only the team, we decided what we’ll do. It was still a bit vague….We would like to do something with specific characteristics of mfp5. From now on we were thinking out of the box and find a real clear idea of our project.
Week 17
This week we converged the ten ideas into three main ideas. We gave on Friday a presentation for the advisors, supervisors and some experts-guests from companies.  After the presentation we decided to take into account the advice of all the advisors and decide after the weekend which real topic we’ll do.
Week 16
The focus this week was mainly brainstorming. We had 150 ideas, and we wanted to converge these ideas to maximal 10 ideas.

TU Delft: A modern university with a rich tradition
In Greek mythology Prometheus, whose torch forms the TU Delft logo, was a titan who defied Zeus, the supreme god, to steal fire from Olympus and give it to mankind. It was an act that marked the beginning of man’s technological development.
In the spirit of Prometheus, TU Delft is an entrepreneurial university at the forefront of technological development. As such it is perpetually involved in furthering technological advancement in the interests of society. By means of its fundamental and applied research and educational programmes, TU Delft trains the engineers of tomorrow.
Established on 8th January 1842 by King Willem II, TU Delft has a rich tradition reaching back more than 160 years. Initially the university focused predominantly on civil engineering but gradually more and more engineering disciplines have appeared on the academic programme. Today TU Delft has eight faculties and it currently offers fifteen BSc and twenty-nine MSc programmes. With approximately 13,000 students and an academic staff of 2,100 (including 200 professors), TU Delft is the largest and most comprehensive university of engineering sciences in the Netherlands.
TU Delft website
Excellent research and education standards
TU Delft is a state university which conducts cutting edge research and provides first class education. In addition to national accreditation, many of TU Delft's educational programmes have also been acknowledged by international organisations such as the American Board of Engineering & Technology (ABET).
TU Delft's research portfolio is clustered around thirteen interdisciplinary technological themes examples of which are Computational Science and Engineering, Mechatronics and Microsystems, Nanotechnology, Sustainable Industrial Processes and Water: Water Works, Water Management and Water Quality. Research is conducted within the faculties, research institutes and research schools. Each year, the University's cumulative research results in an average of 185 PhD dissertations, and over 4,000 publications in scientific journals. Research and education are interrelated. This is most notable in the MSc programmes which are research driven and challenge students to make their own contributions.
Life Science & Technology
Most participants of the TU Delft iGEM team follow the Life Science & Technology bachelor at TU Delft or Leiden University. This programme aims to equips us with knowledge and expertise on the fundamental level and to familiarise you with the technologies inherent to practical applications of that knowledge. The subsequent master programs at the TU Delft are Biocatalysis, Cell Factory and Biochemical Engineering. As a graduate of the programme, we are well prepared for a career in either an industrial or an academic environment.

The department of Biotechnology concentrates on the multidisciplinary fields of Biocatalysis, Metabolic Engineering & Fermentation Technology, Environmental Biotechnology and Bioprocess Technology as well as the exciting developments in the area of Life Science & Technology - in particular, genomics and metabolomics.
TU Delft Department of Biotechnology website
Enzymology
The TU Delft iGEM Team is very happy and proud to be a guest at the Enzymology Department. This group carries out fundamental and applied research in the field of enzymology: the bio-chemistry, biophysics and molecular biology of enzymes in living cells and as purified chemical compounds.
Emphasis is on the bioconversions by redox enzymes, in particular metalloenzymes, from extremophilic organisms, i.e. with a putative, intrinsic added value of stability under typical operational conditions for practical applications. A general Leitmotiv is the study of physiologically related proteins (e.g., metallo-enzymes, metal transport, metal insertion) as elements of a sub-network of the cell machinery with the objective to gather an understanding of integrated biological functioning.

The supervising team
Supervisors
Aljoscha Wahl
Since 2008 I am teaching at TU Delft in the Biotechnology department. In our research we focus on in-vivo metabolism of yeast, penicillium chrysogenum and to less extend E.coli. Quantitative analysis of metabolic fluxes and concentrations is challenging and only by using tracer experiments and extensive modeling can elucidate intracellular processes with sufficient precision.
iGEM has a close connection to my teaching and research, experiments, assay development and modeling. For me iGEM is the way to go in education – challenge yourself with a design and make it work, plus the fun iGEM is as a growing, motivated community.Looking forward to the Jamborees and see all the amazing work done at iGEM!
Esengül Yildirim
For several years, I, Esengül Yildirim, have been employed at Kluyver laboratory for Biotechnology at the Enzymology section as a supporting staff member on education and research. My research focusses on expression of membrane associated oxidoreductases. In addition, I supervise several Bachelor and Master students that are doing their internship at our department. As soon as I learned about the iGEM competition, I was immediately enthusiastic and made my molecular laboratory available for the summer period. Now iGEM is a recurring event at our department. Together with three colleagues, Anne, Aljoscha and Alessandro, I will supervise this year's iGEM team. Hopefully, this year's multidisciplinary team will perform well and will make it trough to the World Championship Jamboree in Boston. 
Alessandro Abate
I'm a system theorist and control engineer who has been charmed by the fundamental questions that biology tries to give an answer to, and yet who believes in formal and engineering approaches to tackle such questions. My research interests are in the analysis, control, and verification of probabilistic and hybrid systems, and in their general application over a number of domains, particularly in systems biology.
Anne Meyer
I have been a professor in the Department of Bionanoscience at TU Delft since January 2011. My laboratory utilizes techniques of biochemistry and microbiology to study processes of stress response in bacteria. In particular we are currently interested in biocrystallization, a phenomenon in which bacteria condense their chromosome into a highly compacted linear array that can provide protection from damaging environmental conditions. I have enjoyed learning about the iGEM competition in previous years, and I am thrilled to be able to take part in helping with the challenge this year!
Katelijne Bekers
I am a third-year PhD student at TU Delft in the Biotechnology department. In the section Bioprocess Technology I do research on the redox metabolism of yeast and its relation to bioethanol production and ethanol stress. As a part of my PhD I am involved in education, which I enjoy a lot. Having the opportunity to supervise iGEM allows me to be involved in a unique project with fascinating challenges, surprising results and great teamwork.

Week 24
This week was a wiki week. I am a noob in HTML, but I am starting to understand it. It is really cool. Furthermore we try to set up a collaboration with Lyon and Michigan to discuss to
Week 23
This week more funding applications went out for the TU Delft project. I hope to get some positive answers soon and round up the funding part. The lab is calling out for occupation. It was a long and exhausting week for me so i'm very happy the weekend is ahead of me.
Week 22
This week I focused on the funding. Mondag and Thuesday I worked on the funding application of the StuD Fund. It is now finished and send out for evaluation. Wednesday I  had again a meeting with Simon Goede. Thursday and Friday I worked on the sponsor application of the University Fund Delft.
Week 21
This week we gave a lecture to all the professors about our project to gain usefull input. I worked whole week on the sponsoring brochure in Indesign, but it is a lot more complicated then I thought. A friend of mine, industrial design student Stefan Heijboer, made the final logo on thursday evening.
Week 20
Sunday we finished the OSLI sponsor application with a lot of effort from the whole team! Thursday we had a meeting with Han de Winde, head of department of Biotechnology. It was a brief get-to-know meeting. I also had a meeting with Elly Muilman, head of finance of Biotechnology. She explained me how fund raising works and she had very useful input. Wednesday I sad down with a friend to make a quick draft for the logo.
Week 19
This week was a lot of general brainstorming on the project topic and doing research on the feasibility of the idea. Wednesday I had my first meeting with Simon Goede, board member of Biotechnology. We talked about what we expected from each other. A good fundament for a long term collaboration. Friday we had a meeting with all Dutch teams (Gronigen, Wageningen and Amsterdam) in Amsterdam for an update on what everybody was doing, a topic presentation and exchanging valuable information.
Week 18
Sunday I returned from a ten-day trip to the UK. When I entered the iGEM room on Monday I was a bit disappointed that there was still no real topic choice. We wanted to do something with Mfp-5, but we still didn't know exactly what. A week of brainstorming and research followed.
Week 17
I spent the whole week in the UK. I walked past Imperial College for a meeting with their iGEM team, but unfortunately the building was closed because of Bank Holidays. Later that week I had a tour at Cambrigde University and I totally forgot to ask about their iGEM team. Shame on me!
Week 16
This week was filled with brainstorm sessions and discussions. The goal was to make a top 10 out of the 150 ideas we generated during the brainstorm sessions. Thursday morning I left for the UK.

Aljoscha Wahl
Since 2008 I am teaching at TU Delft in the Biotechnology department. In our research we focus on in-vivo metabolism of yeast, penicillium chrysogenum and to less extend E.coli. Quantitative analysis of metabolic fluxes and concentrations is challenging and only by using tracer experiments and extensive modeling can elucidate intracellular processes with sufficient precision.
iGEM has a close connection to my teaching and research, experiments, assay development and modeling. For me iGEM is the way to go in education – challenge yourself with a design and make it work, plus the fun iGEM is as a growing, motivated community.
Looking forward to the Jamborees and see all the amazing work done at iGEM!
Esengül Yildirim
For several years, I, Esengül Yildirim, have been employed at Kluyver laboratory for Biotechnology at the Enzymology section as a supporting staff member on education and research. My research focusses on expression of membrane associated oxidoreductases. In addition, I supervise several Bachelor and Master students that are doing their internship at our department. As soon as I learned about the iGEM competition, I was immediately enthusiastic and made my molecular laboratory available for the summer period. Now iGEM is a recurring event at our department. Together with three colleagues, Anne, Aljoscha and Alessandro, I will supervise this year's iGEM team. Hopefully, this year's multidisciplinary team will perform well and will make it trough to the World Championship Jamboree in Boston.

Week 32
Weeks 30 & 31
Finally vacations!!! I was looking forward for that one year now…. Greece I am coming…
Week 29
Week 28
Week 27
Week 26
Week 25
Week 24
Week 23
Week 22
This week also was full of literature research. We wanted to have a final answer and solutions in our localization questions. Finally, we decided to use parts of Denmark 2010 iGEM team, where transmembrane proteins were used (large clusters at the cell poles). The end of the week was mainly for study of the activation of mfp-5. Questions for the existence of tyrosinase in the periplasm and its degradation but also about the normal way of tyrosinase secretion from mussels were my priority.
Week 21
This week started with a long presentation of our ideas and questions in front of the professors of the Biotechnology Department. It was a very good opportunity for their scientific input in our project. From that moment we focused in literature study about the genes that we are planning to use for our more advanced biobricks, the constructs that have to do with the localization of our protein in the membrane. The question was: Flagella machinery or chemoreceptors???
Week 20
Funding letters...
Week 19
We spent all weekend working on the research proposal for OSLI. It was a long and stressful weekend but and the end we did it! It was very nice to see all of us working for the same goal. This week we, as the new iGEM team, had a first meeting with Han de Winde, the head of the department of biotechnology.
Week 18
With the team we decide to concentrate our research in one of all the Mussel foot proteins: the Mussel foot protein 5 (Mfp-5). Esmee and I did a deeper research about the properties of Mfp-5. At the end of the week we had already concluded in our final idea and its subprojects: cell-cell adhesion, cell-surface adhesion, and the regulation of the adhesive properties of Mfp-5. On Friday afternoon the team had a meeting with the other three Dutch iGEM teams in Amsterdam.
Week 17
After a weekend that we had enough time to relax and think all our possibilities, we conclude in the topic of our iGEM project. In the beginning the idea was to combine both topics. Finally, the adhesive Mussel foot protein (Mfp) ""stuck"" in our minds... From Wednesday we started the literature research about our topic and its prospects. On Friday we gave a detailed presentation for our ideas in the Department of Biotechnology. In between, we had relaxing time going for a boat trip with all the members of the team, followed at the end of the week from some drinks in Beestenmarkt.
Week 16
This was a week full of brainstorming meetings...On Monday we had a meeting with our supervisors and advisors. We finally reached around 150 topics. Our goal until the expire of the week was to come as closer as possible to our goal: our final topic!!! On Thursday we decide to continue with the four most prevalent topics. Esmee and I were responsible for the topic: Adhessive Mussel foot protein. On Friday we gave a presentation for each one of these topics in front of advisors, supervisors and some guests. We finally end the week with the two best ideas for us!
Week 15
Lesley Robertson, the Biological Safety Officer of the Faculty of Applied Sciences met us in her office. She explained us about the safety issues and the regulations that we have to follow while working in the lab. At the end of the week we had our second brainstorming session. All of us were very creative and we came up with many new ideas for topics.
Week 14
""Our first Brainstorming session"". We came up with a lot of interesting ideas. It was a very productive day! Our goal for the next meetings is to have as many topics as possible.
Week 13
This week a presentation from two members of the last year's iGEM team of TU Delft (Nadine and Eva) was in our schedule. They gave us a short introduction about Synthetic Biology, their way of working last year, their advices, but also about our responsibilities while working for iGEM. Amsterdam’s iGEM team was there as well! We had the opportunity to meet them and to have our first talk about our progress and our future plans. The advices of the supervisors from both teams were very inspiring and useful in planning our first steps…
Week 12
Exams...Stress...but at the end success!!!
Week 11
At the end of this week, our first meeting with the team took place in the iGEM room! We finally met with the rest of the members of the new iGEM team of TU Delft. We had the opportunity to introduce ourselves, to express our interests and the reasons that led each one of us to join the team of this year. Nice experience... At the end we decided to have our next meeting one to two weeks later, due to the exam period, in order fun to start!!!

Week 26
This week we decided to work out the laboratory ideas in more detail. We divided our project into 4 ""subprojects"": production, transport, activation and characterization of Mgfp-5. Tania, Janneke, Carsten and I each worked on one of these subprojects. I wrote a laboratory manual for characterization of Mgfp-5. Hope to get started in the lab next week!
Week 23
After the general meeting I had a wiki meeting with Conrad and a PR meeting with Janneke. Together with Carsten I did some more research on companies that perform gene synthesis. I also put online everybody's notebook.
Week 22
On Monday we had a general meeting with the team and supervisors. After that I had a meeting with Conrad for the wiki. In the evening we presented iGEM to the DreamTeam board of the TU Delft. After that we went to the city center to have diner and drink some beers. On Tuesday Janneke and I generated ideas for PR and human practice which we worked more out on Friday. On Wednesday and Thursday I did research for gene synthesis companies.
Week 21
On Monday we presented our ideas to professors of the Department of Biotechnology and we discussed the possibilities with them. After the general meeting we we ate pancakes in the Botanic Garden for lunch. In the afternoon I had a wiki meeting with Conrad. On Tuesday we had a meeting with Han de Winde, the chairman of the Department of Biotechnology. The same week I requested bio-bricks of Berkeley Wetlab 2009, Tokyo Tech 2009 and SDU-Denmark 2010.
Week 20
This week I had a meeting with Conrad for the wiki, Janneke and I looked for bio-bricks of previous iGEM teams which we can use for our own project.
Week 19
Tania and I did research on the properties of Mussel foot protein 5. On Friday we discussed the best way of going on with the whole team. We deciced to divide our project in three subprojects: cell-cell adhesion, cell-surface adhesion, and enhancement of the ahesive properties of Mfp-5. In the afternoon we had a meeting with the other three Dutch iGEM teams (Amsterdam, Wageningen, Groningen) in Amsterdam. We teams presented our project after which we discussed each project in more detail in smaller groups. In the evening wee drank beers and ate pizza with the whole group. It was fun to meet the other teams and to get an idea of what they are doing!
Week 18
This week we presented our ideas of iGEM to the other team members. I looked into bio-bricks of previous iGEM teams and sent emails to people who worked with Mussel foot proteins to increase our knowledge.
Week 17
On Easter Monday we had the idea to combine the two left topics to one, but on Tuesday we finally decided to go one with just one: adhesiveness of Mussel foot protein. On Wednesday and Thursday we studied the literature on Mfp. For relaxation we made a boat trip trough the canals of Delft. We presented our final topic to the Biotechnology department on Friday. Afterwards, we went to the Beestenmarkt to drink some beers. We also drank some beers in the Botanic garden because of Mark Loosdrecht's medal.
Week 16
On Monday we had our third brainstorm session with advisors and supervisors. On Tuesday our 100 ideas were narrowed down to a top 20. We did literature study on these 20 topics and on Wednesday we made a top 10. On Thursday 4 topics were left. On Friday we gave a presentations about each topic to businessmen, adivisors and supervisors. Two ideas survived the elimination race and were further studied during the weekend!
Week 15
On Tuesday Drew Endy gave a presentation at Department of Bionanoscience!!! On Wednesday we had a meeting with Lesley Robertson, Biological Safety Officer of the Faculty of Applied Sciences. On Friday we had our second brainstorm session with advisors and supervisors.
Week 14
On Friday we had our first brainstorm session with advisors and supervisors.
Week 13
On Thursday we had a practical lab course by Nadine Bongaerts and Eva Brinkman (team members of last year's TU Delft iGEM team). The Amsterdam iGEM teams was there too and afterwards we had lunch together and discussed the progress our the projects with each other.
Week 11
On Friday we had our first team meeting in the iGEM room!

What we did
We used standard parts from the Registry from the Gronigen Team (K190015: ArsR-regulated promoter) and the Endy Lab (E0840: GFP-generator) and from the MIT 2006 Team (J45119: Wintergreen generator).  We made two composite parts with the ArsR-regulated promoter and the GFP-generator or the Wintergreen generator.  We then joined them together to make our device which scientifically detects arsenic by a green fluorescent glow and warns about arsenic with a wintergreen smell, in case you don't have any scientific equipment.

Tony Papanicolaou, Jeff Boudreau and the Chin-Sang Lab
Everyone at the Chin-Sang lab, particularly the technicians Tony Papanicolaou and Jeff Boudreau, were extraordinarily helpful this summer. We are heavily indebted to their constant advice, training and troubleshooting practices (and supplying countless supplies when our stocks ran low!). We would also like to thank Tony for the microinjection training and always being around with a cheerful smile.
You can find out more about the groundbreaking research being conducted by the Chin-Sang lab here .
Chris Palmer,  Steven Goldie, Geoff Halliday and QGEM 2010
Last year's Queen's_Canada team was a great help to transition the 2011 crew. Chris Palmer acted as our Hiring & Transitions Manager and got the team up-to-speed on synthetic biology practices and the iGEM Competition. In addition, he was often frantically called in to answer questions and provide additional support. Our Winter/Spring Team Manager, Steve Goldie ,  was responsible for all preparations for the team entering the lab this summer. Geoff Halliday was an invaluable asset with his tech-savvy recommendations for the 2011 Wiki.
Check out the Queens_Canada 2010 Project Wiki for a comprehensive look at C. elegans and the team members behind it all.
QGEM Executive and the 2009 Team
QGEM 2011 would not be possible without the foundational effort put forth by the founding members of iGEM at Queen's. Harry Zhou and James MacLeod were not only co-founders of QGEM 2009 , but have been instrumental in securing funding for the 2010 & 2011 teams. They have also been a continual resource throughout the years.
The 2011 executive was a team of undergraduates who worked in the winter semester to recruit, train and prepare the summer team members for the iGEM stretch. Led by Steve Goldie, they ensured a smooth transition and quick startup of lab work.

Mission Statement
The objective of the Queen’s Genetically Engineered Machine (QGEM) Team is to provide a learning opportunity to a team of Queen’s students by supporting them to allow them to compete at the International Genetically Engineered Machine Competition (iGEM).
The team will develop their genetic engineering project, complete it over the course of the summer and then prepare for the iGEM competition in the fall.
Completing an iGEM project will give the students experience in applying engineering and biological principles to solve real‐world problems, while allowing them to gain a broader knowledge base and learn to work in an interdisciplinary team environment.

Novel Assembly Method: PCR Ligation
While an effective method, our team felt the standardized method of BioBrick assembly had two key issues which limited it's effectiveness:
Undesired Ligation Products: Both the Standard BioBrick Assembly and the 3A Assembly require the ligation of the desired insert into one of the standard BioBrick plasmid vectors for amplification. During the digestion and ligation process, the plasmid bones and the desired inserts may ligate in many possible configurations and may generate undesired ligation products
Lengthy Ligation Time: The conventional method is very time- intensive. The Standard BioBrick Assembly Standard and the 3A Assembly allow only the assembly of two BioBrick parts at once. Consequently, the assembly of a construct containing 3 BioBrick parts, will require at least 4 incubation periods to complete assuming each step of the assembly is successful on the first attempt.
To improve the assembly progress, our team examined the possibility of using the polymerase-chain reaction (PCR) to complete ligations.
back to top
Mechanism
The PCR-Ligation Method of BioBrick Assembly allows the ligation of two linear BioBrick Parts surrounded by the BioBrick prefix and suffix, hereon referred to as Part A (red) and Part B (blue).They can be permanently ligated to each other using the SpeI cut site of Part A and the XbaI cut site of Part B. This linear ligation product is then PCR amplified using the Left Primer of Part A and the Right Primer of Part B. The PCR product then undergoes gel electrophoresis, and the DNA product corresponding to the right length is extracted and purified for further use.
During the ligation process, only one of the digestion enzymes, XbaI and SpeI is removed, and one remains in the ligation mixture. If the correct ligation occurred, a permanent scar will result from the ligation of XbaI sticky end to SpeI sticky end that is no longer recognized by either XbaI or SpeI digestion enzymes. The one enzyme remaining in the solution will serve as a selection mechanism for the correct ligation product, and prevent the re-ligation of digested fragments. The removal of one enzyme is necessary for the procedure. If both enzymes remain in the ligation mixture, undesired ligation can occur in which Part B will be ligated to Part A due to the double sticky ends created. However, if both digestion enzymes are removed, there will no longer be a selection mechanism for the correct ligation product.
The PCR Amplification of the ligation product using the left primer of Part A and the right primer of Part B serves as another selection mechanism for the correct ligation product, because only the correct ligation product will be amplified in the PCR reaction using those two primers. In addition, the PCR Amplification using high fidelity polymerase system improves the fidelity of this assembly method. Each step of the assembly only requires one PCR reaction for amplification instead of two bacterial incubation periods. This shortens the amplification time required for the assembly of a construct containing 3 BioBrick parts from 4 bacterial incubation periods to 2 PCR reactions.
The PCR-ligation method of BioBrick assembly is easy to debug once errors arise during the assembly. The PCR amplification product after each step of the assembly undergoes gel electrophoresis. Only the DNA product corresponding to the correct length of the desired ligation product is extracted and purified for further use. In order for the assembly to proceed to the next step, the previous step of the assembly must be successful. Since every step of the PCR-ligation assembly is checked before further processing, the number of potential errors that need to be accounted for during troubleshooting is significantly reduced compared to the convention methods of assembly.
Like the conventional methods of assembly, the linear product of PCR-ligation also contains the BioBrick prefix at its 5’ end and the BioBrick suffix at its 3’ end. Therefore, this method of assembly can theoretically be repeated an infinite number of times for the assembly of multiple BioBrick parts.
PCR Ligation, with one cleanup (above)
PCR Ligation, without cleanup (below)
Protocol
Materials
- Thermocycler
- PCR Tubes (0.2mL)
- KAPA HiFi™ Hotstart Kit
- 10 µl of each of the 2 linear BioBrick parts to be ligated
- 10 µM solution of left primer of BioBrick part A
- 10 µM solution of right primer of BioBrick part B
- Fermentas FastDigest SpeI system
- Fermnetas FastDigest XbaI system
- KAPA Fast Ligase system
- TBE (pH = 8.0)
- 3 µl of Ethidium Bromide
- Biotechnology grade Agarose
- Gel Box
- Power Supply
- Gel Supply
- Loading Dye
- Bio Basics EZ-10 PCR Product Purification Kit
- Transilluminator
Method
1.  Digest linear BioBrick part A with the SpeI FastDigestion system, and digest linear BioBrick part B with the XbaI FastDigestion system.
2. Perform enzymatic cleanup for one of the digest mixtures using EZ-10 PCR Product Purification kit.
3. Mixing of the clean-up product and other digestion product in a 1:1 ratio to obtain a 10 µl mixture.
4. Use the 10 µl mixture and the Fast Ligase System to ligate the two BioBrick parts together.
5. Use the ligation product from the previous step as the template DNA for PCR amplification. Use the 10 µM solution of left primer of BioBrick part A and the 10 µM solution of right primer of BioBrick part B as primers for the PCR Amplification.
6. Follow the instructions in the KAPA HiFi™ Hotstart Kit to perform the PCR reaction. Only 20 to 25 thermocycles are necessary to amplify the ligation product.
7. Create a 1% agarose gel for electrophoresis of the PCR products.
8. With loading dye, load the entire digestion mixture to the 1% agarose gel. Perform gel electrophoresis at 100V and 400 mA for 60 minutes.
9. Using transilluminator, gel extract the visible DNA product corresponding to the right length of the ligation product.
10. Follow the instructions in the Bio Basics EZ-10 Purification Kit, perform purification of the gel extracted products.
11. This gel extracted product may be used for further assembly and processing.

Attributions and Contributions
An iGEM project needs a great team to accomplish and it can not be done by one day. Our team is built up of 1 instructor and 7 students (1 student advisor, 1 graduate student, and 5 undergraduate students). During the whole summer of 2011, our team members were working on CRISPR or ""E. Curi""  cooperatively with our instructor. We would like to thank the USC Leonard Davis School of Gerontology, the David and Dana Dornsife College of Letters, Arts, and Sciences, and the Viterbi School of Engineering for their help and support.  We also appreciate the help of all the sponsors and Dr. Brouns from Wageningen University.
Details about our members' work are listed:
Alexa brainstormed with the team and cooperated with other members to do research involving the CRISPR system.
Kevin brainstormed with the team, cooperated with other team members, spearheaded scholarly research, and designed the human practices event. His background in physics and mathematics provided useful counterpoints and insights to other aspects of early stage projects and then eventually the CRISPR system.  Led the T-Shirt designing process.
Dongzhu's chemical engineering knowledge was applied to an earlier idea of enhancing yeast ethanol tolerance.  As the team decided to move forward with the CRISPR system, he brought his insight and knowledge into that project.  Dongzhu designed the hardcopy survey for the human practices event and was one of the main contributors/editors to the wiki page.
Ellen brainstormed with the team, cooperated with other team members, and was engaged in an early stage idea of rust detection and elimination. Her background in biology and years of experience in wetlab techniques were very valuable during research and implementation of the CRISPR system.  Ellen led the implementation of the social media aspect of the human practices event.
Indi brainstormed with the team and cooperated with other members to do research involving the CRISPR system. She was also heavily involved in the T-shirt design process and helped launch the wiki page.
Percy was involved in the initial brainstorming and early project investigations.  He led and contributed to the development of implementing the CRISPR system.  He was the led on the CRISPR project and ran the project implementation from day to day, including, but not limited to wetlab research, team networking, fund acquisition, and non-standard part acquisition. He helped design both the panel discussion and social media aspects of the human practices event.  Percy was also one of the main contributors/editors to the wiki page.
Nolan was involved in the initial brainstorming and early project investigations.  He acted as team manager, university liaison, fundraiser, scientific/engineering adviser and all around good guy. Design and wrote simple matlab code to analyze growth testing data and determine OD Levels based on the data.  Nolan was also one of the main contributors/editors to the wiki page.
Dr. Sean Curran graciously provided the team with lab space, equipment, reagents and supplies.  As the advisor he organized the iGEM effort at USC, recruited an outstanding team, organized and led the early training of non-experienced iGEM members, and led all brainstorming and wetlab efforts.  An invaluable resource, USC iGEM would not have gotten off the ground without him, thank you Dr. Sean Curran.

Hi dudes,
I’m Gaël and I’m still a student at the INSA of Lyon while all my mates are going to be graduated in the last few month but without me because I had decided to take a gap year before my last year of studies, which allowed me to take fully part at the iGEM championship in 2010.
Then after 6 months in Australia and 3 in Spain, I’m back to the lab (again yo!!), giving my best to allow the team to go confident in Amsterdam where I hope I will meet again people I met last year. See yaaaaaaaaaaa!!

Graduated from the University Claude Bernard Lyon 1 in 2009 with a Research Master in “Microbiology and Ecology”, I am currently doing a PhD on Plant Growth Promoting Bacteria at the laboratory of Microbial Ecology of Lyon .
Within this framework, I have had the opportunity of supervising several trainees on ecological and bacterial genetics issues. Being mainly interested in ecological issues, my participation in the iGEM 2011 international competition is my own way of sharing skills in microbial genetics, ecology and to learn from my interaction with students in return.

Soufiane Boumahdi
As a student in biochemistry engineering at INSA, I first heard of Igem in 2007, when Endy Drew, Igem's founder came to INSA to promote this new competition in Europe. After two years thinking of this idea, I finally decided to join Igem Paris team in 2009 to enjoy this competition within an experienced team. Convinced that the department of Biosciences at INSA had the perfect tools to participate in this competition, mixing together an engineering background with strong microbiological and bio-informatics knowledge, I helped the emergence of a new team in 2010 and tried to share my experience of the competition with all the team members. After the success of team iGEM INSA Lyon 2010 (silver medal), I am very happy to be an advisor for team Lyon INSA-ENS in 2011.

Alexandre Duprey
I am a third year student in biochemistry and biotechnology at INSA Lyon. This project is, for me, a unique opportunity to participate in a research project. As my objective is to become a researcher, I hope this will be rewarding. But also, as iGEM is more than just experiments, to acquire different skills like how to look for sponsors, scientific communication... in an international context. All this will be enriching for me.

The city
The first traces of a town date from 43 BC. Thanks to its strategic location, the town quickly expanded and became the capital of the empire of Gaul in 27BC. The roman town was situated on the Fourvière hill. Nowadays, the anthic theatre and the Odeon remain.
Lyon is also marked by its medieval and renaissance legacy, like you can see in the old town. The traboules, which were  connections between the small medieval streets, were helpful during the Second World War because they allowed the French resistance, for example, to escape from the gestapo. They're narrow, like some sort of secret passage. Today a great area of the city is listed in the world heritage of UNESCO, like the old town, Fourvière, Croix Rousse among others.
As far as industry is concerned, Lyon was historically specialised in chemistry and textile. When the textile industry started closing, pharmacy and biotechnology developped instead.  Today, Lyon is one of the most important cities of France with almost half a million inhabitants (3rd in France, behind Paris and Marseille) and an area of 50 km². It's also the second touristic city after Paris with 6 millions of tourists every year. It is the capital of Rhône department and the Rhône-Alpes region.
A basilica was built on the former forum of Lugdunum and named Notre-Dame de Fourvière. It's dedicated to the immaculate conception. It is one of the most visible building of the city. The two important places in the peninsula are the Terreaux place and the Bellecour place. The banks of the Rhone are designed and a lot of bars can be found on barges.
Some other important buildings and places :
La Part-Dieu : it's a big tower whose nickname is the ""pencil Tower"". It is 165 m high. Near the tower, there is also the biggest commercial center built in a city in Europe. You can enjoy almost 250 shops.
Some old buildings like the Brotteaux train station.
The park ""La tête d'or"" :  it's a park of 117 ha in the north area of the city. It opened in 1857. Today it is a place where people go for walking, running, ride roller, biking, rest,... There is a zoological park, a velodrome, a rosary and a botanic garden. It's located next to the campus of la Doua and the INSA.
The ""fête des Lumières""
All these places are enhanced during the “Fête des lumières” (the festival of Lights), during the week of the 8th December. In the religious history, it is the date of the immaculate conception and then in 1854 the inauguration of the statue of Marie. This statue was erected in order to protect the city from the plague. At the end of the XIXth century, it became an important touristic event with millions of people coming every year. The tradition is to put a small candle (called ""lumignon"") on the window of your home. The buildings are illuminated and there are some light animations in the strategic places of the city. This event has an international reputation.
Some other important events : in September the dance biennial and the contemporary art biennial.
Gastronomy
Lyon and its region are also known as a gastronomic area : there are a lot of great chef like Paul Bocuse and Eugénie Brazier. The specialties of the city are the quenelle, the rosette (sausage), the ""salade lyonnaise"" (lettuce with bacon, crouton and poached egg). You can enjoy these dishes in the ""Bouchon lyonnais"", typical restaurants, spread among the city. The Rhone-Alpes region is also known for the cheese (tomme de Savoie, reblochon, Mont d'or,...) and the wine (Beaujolais, Côte du Rhone).
Cinema & Photography
Lyon had also played a great part in the history of cinema and photography thanks to the Lumière Brothers. Auguste and Louis Lumière were among the earliest filmmakers in the history. In 1895, they projected their first short motion pictures, including their famous first film :“ Workers leaving the Lumieres factory”. Each film runs less than a minute, which represents a 17 meter long reel. They developed the device called cinematograph which allows the record, development and projection of motion pictures.Today, you can visit the Lumiere Institute which is located in the brothers’ old house.

Graduated from the ENS Cachan, and after a first experience in research at Pasteur Institute in Paris on mRNA alternative splicing, I am currently working at the Human Virology Department (INSERM U758) in Lyon on issues in relation with translational control of viral proteins during an infection, and in particular control of the internal entry of ribosomes in the messenger RNA by RNA sequences called IRES (Internal Ribosome Entry Site).
I am also a trainer to the aggregation of Life Sciences and Sciences of the Earth and the Universe. I have always had a passion for biological mechanics, and facing the enthusiasm of students, I have decided to accompany them in this international competition that represents iGEM.

Graduated from INSA de Lyon in 2009, I decided to carry on with a PhD in Molecular Microbiology in the same school.
In 2010 I came down with a synthetic virus called iGEM and to recover from it Dr P.Lejeune told me to become the instructor of the 2010 INSA Lyon iGEM team. Since this time I struggle with this virus and being an advisors of INSA ENS team this year is my new treatment (Thanks Dr. C. Dorel).
More seriously and accurately being an instructor of last year team allowed me to learn a lot from students and as I wanted to learn again this year I am really glad I can be an advisor of this INSA ENS Team.

Hi! I have just completed my first year in biochemistry and biotechnology at INSA of Lyon. It's my first year of participation to IGEM. I am excited participating to this contest, I think it's a great scientific and human  adventure which allows us to get more experience. I also take part to IGEM because it's a project led by students, which is the best way to apply what we learnt in class. Moreover our working on a subject which contributes to the preservation of the environment is a way to give a real meaning to our challenge.

INSA : Institut National des Sciences Appliquées
INSA (see the website) : Institut National des Sciences Appliquées, which means National Institute for Applied Sciences is a network of five engineering schools in which students can enter after Baccalauréat (french ""A"" level). They are located in five important french cities : Lyon, Rennes, Toulouse, Rouen and Strasbourg.
Today, there are almost 52,000 engineers who graduated from INSA engineering schools. Specializations in various fields are proposed : chemistry, mechanics, civil, electric, and material engineering among others. They are public engineering schools.
INSA engineering school of Lyon is the oldest INSA. Its construction was quick and the courses started at the end of 1957. The first buildings were on a swamp. Then, the swamp has been gradually constructed with new buildings for room classes, accommodations and research laboratories. Today, INSA Lyon sets 12 different specializations after the 2 years of preparation classes.
The Community life is an important part of the INSA Student life. There are more than one hundred student associations. The students organize a lot of events like the Raid, the 24 hours of INSA,...Then, people can acquire scientific skills but they can also develop  human relations in order to become a complete engineer.
Students having great abilities in sports can enjoy rearranged timetables so that they can keep practicing their favorite sports. During their scientific education, other students choose to follow music, art, dance or theater classes. The international openness is not neglected either: there are four international sections which students can attend during the first two preparation years. Those special sections welcome students from all around the world :
Amerinsa (for the latino american area),
Asinsa (for the asian area),
Eurinsa (for the european area)
SCAN (most classes are taught in english).
There are about 30% of foreign students.
Our speciality: Biosciences, this departement is divided into two sections which are Biochemistry and Biotechnologies engineering, and Bioinformatics and Modelisation engineering. At the end of the five years in our school,  we graduate with a master of engineering in Biosciences.
It is one of the most recent department of the school and the smallest with less than 200 students. It was created at the request of Charles Mérieux then president of Biomerieux company, an important biochemical industry which was founded in Lyon.

During my studies, I heard about biofilms for the first time. I’m passionate about these amazing structures since. That’s why I began a thesis about biofilms functions in sewers. Being in charge of this student project, about environment and biofilms is, for me, really interesting and enriching.

Bruno Cedat from the Rovaltain Center, technopole implied in the environmental protection.
Chun Chau Sze from the NTU Laboratory, who gave us a fluorescent strain (MG1655) and allowed us to use it for our experiment in the iGEM competition.( J Microbiol Methods. 2009 Feb;76(2):109-19. Epub 2008 Sep 24 )
For some aspects of our communication, thanks to Amanda Lo Van for editing the video of the ""CROSS de l'INSA de LYON"" and France3 Rhône-Alpes, Le Progrès, Radio RCF, Viva,... for broadcasting our project.
Thank to TU Delft for their collaboration and especially Krijn Warringa for making it possible.
Then, our project, close to industrial purposes, led us to deal with people from firms connected to the nuclear power plant industry. We are very grateful to the Tricastin nuclear power plant, Centraco, Michel from the Bugey Nuclear Power Station and Assystem for answering our questions and helping us to get our project closer to reality.
To conclude, we have to dedicate a really big thanks to the team INSA-LYon iGEM (2010)(check their wiki ). They engaged for the first time Lyon and its prestigious schools into the iGEM competition. Without them, the Lyon Biosciences team wouldn't exist.
Using their experience, we learned a lot and understood all the benefits to collaborate wih other people. In this aim, we create a partnership between the INSA de Lyon and the ENS de Lyon, everyone contributing by different ways to an unique project.
But the gathering between these two schools wouldn’t have been possible without the work of some of our supervisors! So, as students and advisors, we would like first to thank them for all the efforts! This collaboration is really rewarding for all the members of the team, as  on the scientific side than the human side.

A la découverte de Lyon
La ville de Lyon

La ville de Lyon
Les premières traces de la ville datent de 43  av JC. Grâce à sa location stratégique la ville s'est rapidement développée et est devenue la capitale de l'empire des Gaules en 27 av JC. La ville romaine était située sur la colline de Fourvière. Aujourd'hui, le théâtre antique et l'Odéon sont encore visibles.
Lyon est aussi marquée par son héritage du Moyen-Age et de la Renaissance, visible dans la vieille ville.  Les traboules, qui sont des passages à travers des cours d'immeuble qui permettent de se rendre d'une rue à une autre, ont été très utiles pendant la Seconde Guerre Mondiale. En effet, c'était des lieux de résistance qui permirent notamment aux résistants d'échapper à la Gestapo. Ils sont étroits, comme des sortes de passages secrets. De nos jours, une grande partie de la ville de Lyon est listée au patrimoine mondial de l'UNESCO, comme la vieille ville, Fourvière, la Croix-Rousse et bien d'autres encore.
En ce qui concerne l'industrie, Lyon était historiquement spécialisée dans la chimie et le textile. Quand les industries textiles ont fermé, la pharmacie et la biotechnologie se sont développées. De nos jours, Lyon est l'une des villes les plus importantes de France avec près d'un demi-million d'habitants (3ème en France derrière Paris et Marseille) et une surface de 50 km². C'est la deuxième destination touristique de France après Paris avec 6 millions de touristes annuels. C'est le chef-lieu du département du Rhône et de la région Rhône-Alpes.
Une basilique fut construite sur l'ancien forum de Lugdunum et nommée Notre-Dame de Fourvière. Elle est dédiée à l'immaculée conception. C'est l'un des bâtiments les plus visibles de la ville. Une partie de la ville de Lyon est située sur une presqu'île qui comprend deux places très connues : la place des Terreaux et la place Bellecour. On trouve de nombreux bars et péniches  sur les bords du Rhône.
D'autres bâtiments ou places importantes :
La Part-Dieu : c'est une grande tour dont le surnom est ""le Crayon"" et de hauteur 165m. Près de la tour, il y a également le plus grand centre commercial construit dans une ville en Europe avec plus de 250 magasins.
Des constructions plus anciennes comme la gare des Brotteaux.
Le parc de ""La tête d'or"" : parc de 11 ha situé au nord de la ville. Ouvert en 1857, c'est aujourd'hui un endroit où les Lyonnais se promènent, courent, font du roller, du vélo, se reposent... Il y a également un parc zoologique, un vélodrome, une roseraie et un jardin botanique. Il est situé près du campus de la Doua et de l'INSA.
La Fête des Lumières
Tous ces lieux sont illuminés durant la ""Fête des Lumières"" le week-end du 8 Décembre. Dans le calendrier religieux, c'est le jour de l'immaculée conception. C'est également un 8 décembre en 1854 qu'a eu lieu l'inauguration de la statue de Marie. Cette statue a été érigée pour protéger la ville de la peste.  A la fin du XIXème siècle, la fête des Lumières est devenue un évènement touristique qui attire des milliers de personnes chaque année. La tradition est de mettre ce jour là une petite bougie (appelée ""lumignon"") sur les rebords de fenêtre. Les immeubles sont alors illuminés et on peut voir dans les rues des animations aux endroits stratégiques de la ville. Cet événement jouit d'une réputation internationale.
D'autres événements ayant lieu à Lyon : en Septembre la Biennale de la Danse et la Biennale de l'Art Contemporain.
Gastronomie
Lyon et sa région sont connus pour leur gastronomie. De nombreux chefs cuisiniers comme Paul Bocuse et Eugénie Brazier exercent à Lyon. Les spécialités lyonnaises sont les quenelles, la rosette, la salade lyonnaise. Tous ces plats peuvent être dégustés dans les ""Bouchons lyonnais"", restaurants typiques, disséminés dans toute la ville. La région Rhône-Alpes est également connue pour ses fromages (tomme de Savoie, reblochon, Mont d'or,...) et le vin (Beaujolais, Côte du Rhône).
Cinéma & Photographie
Lyon a également joué un rôle important dans l'histoire du cinéma et de la photographie grâce aux frères Lumière. Auguste et Louis Lumière ont été parmi les premiers  réalisateurs de l'Histoire. En 1895, ils ont projeté leurs premiers courts-métrages dont leur premier film connu : ""Travailleurs quittant l'usine Lumière"". Chaque film dure moins d'une minute soit une bobine de dix-sept mètres de long. Ils ont développé un appareil appelé cinématographe permettant l'enregistrement, le développement et la projection d'images animées. Aujourd'hui, on peut visiter l'Institut Lumière dans l'ancienne maison des Frères Lumière.

Mathilde Dumond
Hi,
I am an undergraduate student in fundamental biology, at the ENS of Lyon. It is the first time I am taking part in an iGEM team and I like to be in it. I am expecting much from this work, not only because everyone in the team invested a lot in, but also because it would be really nice to achieve the trip in Boston. I enjoy participating to the big picture of the iGEM: the creation of a bank of genes and concept, easily exportable, usable by everyone. For the future whatever the way it will end, this project helps me to realize how a research team works.
Don't forget to follow science, it's so exciting.

Nous sommes très reconnaissants à la centrale du Tricastin, Centraco, à Michel de la centrale du Bugey et à Assystem d'avoir pris le temps de répondre à nos questions, et de nous avoir aider à donner un aspect réalisable  notre projet.
Enfin, pour finir, nous nous devons de remercier l'équipe INSA-Lyon iGEM (2010)(Pour voir leur wiki ). Ce sont eux qui ont engagé la ville de Lyon et ses prestigieuses écoles au sein du concours iGEM. Sans eux, l'équipe Lyon Biosciences n'existerait surement pas.
En se basant sur leur expérience, nous avons beaucoup appris et compris tous les avantages à collaborer avec d'autres personnes. Dans cet objectif, un partenariat a été créé entre l'INSA de Lyon et l'ENS de Lyon, chacun contribuant de sa propre manière au même projet.
Mais le rassemblement de ces deux écoles n'auraient pas été possible sans le travail de certains de nos Instructors . Ainsi, en tant qu'étudiants et conseillers, nous aimerions les remercier pour tous leurs efforts! Cette collaboration est très enrichissante pour l'ensemble des membres de l'équipe, autant scientifiquement qu'humainement.

Third year student in Biology at the ENS Lyon, it is my first participation to iGEM and it is well worth it. The engeneering approch of this project is very interesting, opposed to the approach we can see in the fondamental research we are taught. iGem is also a great way to meet people, share idea, and have fun !
I hope to meet more people at the European Jamboree, then in the final round.
By the way, I am also a ninja.

L'Ecole Normale Supérieure de Lyon
L'Ecole Normale Supérieur de Lyon (voir le site Internet) est un établissement d'enseignement supérieur dont les statuts sont proches de ceux d'une université avec quelques particularités, notamment le recrutement d'élèves sur concours national et l'accueil sur titre d'auditeur.
C'est un établissement qui dans sa forme actuelle est récent puisqu'il résulte de la fusion au 1er janvier 2010 de l'ENS Sciences et l'ENS Lettres et Sciences Humaines. Dans les faits, elle est l'héritière des écoles de Saint-Cloud et Fontenay aux Roses, créées par Jules Ferry en 1880 et 1882. C'est un établissement dédié à l'enseignement, la recherche et la diffusion des connaissances. Il est multi-disciplinaire et interdisciplinaire, allant des sciences exactes et expérimentales, aux lettres, sciences humaines et sociales et il est à caractère européen. Il rassemble 2150 étudiants dont 400 doctorants.
La qualité de la recherche au sein de l'établissement lui permet de figurer au 100ème rang en 2010 parmi les 604 meilleures universités mondiales (sur les 9 000 recensées par l'UNESCO) et au 3ème rang français selon le classement international publié par le Times Higher Education Supplement.
Le département de biologie propose une formation généraliste de haut niveau à travers un L3 et un master ""Biosciences"" qui sont adossés à des laboratoires reconnus permettant un lien étroit entre la formation et les activités de recherche fondamentale. Il prépare aussi aux métiers de l'enseignement avec une préparation à l'agrégation de Sciences de la Vie, de la Terre et de l'Univers. A l'issue de leur scolarité, environ 80% de nos étudiants poursuivent par une thèse dans différents domaines de la Biologie

Hi !
I'm a student in the fundamental biology department of the ENS Lyon, starting my master's degree in the fall. I've always been very interested in understanding the complex processes that make life what it is, and it seems to me that this iGEM project will help me towards this goal.  Furthermore, the social, and community-oriented aspect of this project will help me get better at working in a group environment : a skill that I'm sure will prove most useful during my academic career.

Associate professor at the Institut National des Sciences Appliquées de Lyon
After a Master of Advanced Studies in Biochemistry and a PhD in Chemistry and Science and Techniques of waste, now I teach Chemistry classes and also  a class dealing with radioactive waste management in the Energy Engineering and Environment department. My research work at the Laboratory of Civil engineering and Environmental engineering (LGCIE) is currently aimed at the study of biophysicochemical interactions of pollutants in various compounds (soils, sediments, municipal solid waste) using molecular biology tools. I am very excited to take part in the iGEM 2011 project which leads to the development of a synergy, already launched, between the Biosciences department and Environmental sciences.

ENS : Ecole Normale Supérieure de Lyon
The Ecole Normale Supérieure de Lyon (see the website) is a high education institution whose statutes are those of a university with a few special features, in particular regarding the recruitment of students on a national competitive entrance examination and the admission with an auditeur status.
In its current form, this institution is considered as recent, resulting from the merge, on January 1st 2010, of the scientific branch and the arts, humanities and social sciences branch. In fact, it inherits from the Saint-Cloud and the Fontenay-aux-Roses schools founded by Jules Ferry in 1880 and 1882. It is dedicated to teaching, research and the dissemination of knowledge. It is both multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary, from accurate and experimental sciences, to human and social sciences. It gathers 2150 students including 400 PhD students.
The quality of research within the institution puts it on the 100th rank in 2010 among the 604 best universities in the world (among the 9000 identified by the Unesco) and on the 3rd rank in France according to the international ranking published by the Times Higher Education Supplement. The department of biology offers a general training of high level through a Bachelor’s degree in Sciences and technologies (BSc) and a “Biosciences” Master’s degree in partnership with renowned laboratories enabling a close bound between the education and the fundamental research activities. It also prepares students for careers in teaching with a preparation for aggregation of Life Sciences and Sciences of the Earth and the Universe. At the end of their education, around 80% of our students follow a thesis in various fields of Biology.

INSA
INSA (voir le site Internet) : Institut National des Sciences Appliquées. C'est un réseau de 5 écoles d'ingénieur post-baccalauréat publiques, localisées dans les villes de Lyon, Rennes, Toulouse, Rouen et Strasbourg.
Aujourd'hui, il y a environ 52 000 ingénieurs formés par l'INSA. Les spécialisations proposées sont très variées : chimie, mécanique, génie civil, électrique, matériaux, informatique et bien d'autres encore.
L'école d'ingénieur située à Lyon est la plus ancienne des INSA. Sa construction a été rapide et les cours ont commencé fin 1957. Puis, les batiments ont été construits petit à petit pour les salles de classes, les logements et les laboratoires de recherche. Aujourd'hui, l'INSA de Lyon propose 12 spécialisations différentes après 2 années de classes préparatoires intégrées.
La vie étudiante occupe une place privilégiée en dehors des cours. Il existe plus d'une centaine d'associations étudiantes. Les étudiants organisent de nombreux évènements comme le Raid, les 24 heures de l'INSA ... Ainsi ils peuvent acquérir, en plus des savoirs scientifiques dispensés en cours, des qualifications humaines pour devenir des ingénieurs humanistes.
Les sportifs de haut niveau peuvent bénéficier d'un emploi du temps aménagé de manière à pouvoir continuer leurs entrainements. En plus des cours scientifiques habituels, les étudiants peuvent également choisir de suivre des cours de musique, de théâtre, d'art ou de danse . L'ouverture à l'international est elle aussi importante : les étudiants peuvent effectuer leur premier cycle (les deux premières années de l'école) dans quatre filières internationales. Celles-ci accueillent des étudiants venant du monde entier :
Amerinsa (pour l'Amérique latine),
Asinsa (pour l'Asie),
Eurinsa (pour l'Europe)
SCAN (la plupart des cours sont en Anglais).
Il y a environ 30% d'étudiants étrangers .
Notre spécialité : Biosciences. Ce département est divisé en deux filières : Biochimie et Biotechnologies d'un côté et Bioinformatique et Modélisation de l'autre. A la fin des cinq années d'école, les étudiants obtiennent un diplôme d'ingénieur de niveau Bac +5.
Il s'agit d'un des plus jeunes départements de l'école et du plus petit de tous avec moins de 200 étudiants. Il a été créé à la demande de Charles Mérieux, alors président de la société Biomérieux, une importante industrie biochimique initialement implantée à Lyon.

Corinne Dorel
My teaching activities in the Microbial Genetics mainly take place within the Biosciences department at INSA Lyon, but also at the Ecole Normale Supérieur de Lyon and at the University Claude Bernard Lyon 1.
My research work is based on the understanding of genetic mecanisms involved in the formation of biofilms and the contamination of materials. Being the Communications officer for the Biosciences department, my participation in iGEM 2011 is part of a strategy to promote and share knowledge in the field of research in genetic engineering and more generally in Biological Sciences.

Viviane Chansavang
As a student in the Biochemistry and Biotechnologies department at INSA Lyon, participating in the iGEM 2011 project is a great opportunity to work within a team to go beyond what we are taught in class, in a both fun and creative way. I believe that this can be a very positive experience for the future. Meeting people from all around the world throughout this competition is something that I am really looking forward to.
I enjoy travelling, learning languages, cooking (and eating), and practicing all kinds of sports (but especially volleyball as well as Beach volleyball).

  The history of Zhejiang University goes back to 114 years ago.As a university founded in 1897, Zhejiang university is one of the earliest Western academic new type schools in China. During the Second World War, Zhejiang University suffered disaster. but insisted on the school's spirits. And moved to the hinterland of China to avoid the aggressor. After called on Zhejiang Univeristy,     the British scholar Joseph Needham said, ""I found in this oriental Cambridge.""
  Zhejiang University survived the War and gradually become one of the top universitys in China. As a truly comprehensive institution with a full range of disciplines, Zhejiang University covers lots of subjects and aims at providing an outstanding education that will enable its students to build a future of professional, intellectual and personal success, capable of leadership in different areas, whether it be political, economic or academic. The elective system of the school is very flexible，so students can enroll whatever the courses they are interested in. That is why we could build such a team with various majors but have no difficulity in understanding each other.
  The school locates in the city of Hangzhou. A saying goes that:""Hangzhou is the most beautiful city in the world!""I don't know whether it is true,but it is the the most beautiful city I've ever seen.And I find that the school equips the beauty of this city.We have five campuses. The names are:""Yuquan"", ""Xixi"", ""Huajiachi"", ""Zhijiang"", and""Zijingang"". These names are all ""water"" related. In English,they mean spring, stream, pool, river, and port. Each campus has its own beauty. Yuquan is charming, Xixi is elegant, Huajiachi is simple, Zhijiang is ancient and Zijingang is modern.

As a truly comprehensive institution with a full range of disciplines, Zhejiang University covers lots of subjects and aims at providing an outstanding education that will enable its students to build a future of professional, intellectual and personal success, capable of leadership in different areas, whether it be political, economic or academic. The elective system of the school is very flexible，so students can enroll whatever the courses they are interested in. That is why we could build such a team with various majors but have no difficulity in understanding each other.
The school locates in the city of Hangzhou. A saying goes that:""Hangzhou is the most beautiful city in the world!""I don't know whether it is true,but it is the the most beautiful city I've ever seen.And I find that the school equips the beauty of this city.We have five campuses. The names are:""Yuquan"", ""Xixi"", ""Huajiachi"", ""Zhijiang"", and""Zijingang"". These names are all ""water"" related. In English,they mean spring, stream, pool, river, and port. Each campus has its own beauty. Yuquan is charming, Xixi is elegant, Huajiachi is simple, Zhijiang is ancient and Zijingang is modern.

Overview
Team Collaboration
Yizhi CAI from Johns Hopkins visiting our team
 
  Yizhi CAI, the instructor for Johns Hopkins iGEM Team and one of the organizers for iGEM, visited our team in late May.23rd. He introduced his Yeast Genome 2.0 Project to us and then discussed some related issues and problems of regional jamboree. In turn, we’ve briefly introduced our team and team project to him. The visit certainly broadened our view of synthetic biology, of other iGEM teams and of the competition itself as well. And more importantly, the visit brought us much closer to iGEM and built the bridge between ZJU and Johns Hopkins.
Haoqian ZHANG from Peking University visiting our team
 
  Haoqian ZHANG, the instructor for this year’s Peking iGEM Team and a former iGEMer, came to visit our team in early May.7th. He first gave a lecture introducing synthetic biology to synthetic biology club members in ZJU, as part of the College of Life Sciences Festival activity. He then introduced Peking iGEM team and projects, and held a wonderful discussion with us. We learned a lot not only from his introductions, but from himself as well. The visit has no doubt built a close relationship between Peking University and ZJU iGEM teams.
iGEM 2011 China Meet-up in USTC
  The iGEM2011 China Meetup was held at University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) from July 29th to July 31th. Seven members of ZJU-China, Ye LI, Keyue MA, Ruoxi PI, Chenlin XU, Yakun XI, Yu XIA and Luyi TIAN participated in this event. During the conference, we introduced our ‘Rainbofilm’ project as well as our experiment progress. We also discussed experiments and team organizing experiences with members
from many other China iGEM teams. Haoqian ZHANG from Peking_R iGEM team kindly helped us with problems we met during our experiments.

Acknowledgements
The iGEM Amsterdam 2011 team would like to thank everyone that helped with our project for their generous support.
As this is the first year the Vrije Universiteit and the Universiteit van Amsterdam sent a team to the iGEM competition, it was a learning experience for everyone. Representing two universities as one team has proven to be very challenging, especially because we are the first team to do so, and we couldn't have gotten this far without all the support. A special thanks goes out to:
Domenico Bellomo; for his invaluable support and experience in running a successful iGEM team.
Pernette J. Verschure; for her help in maintaining the general flow of the project, and for her assistance with all our biosafety related enquiries.
Our daily supervisors: Lisette Anink, Frédéric Crémazy and Diewertje Piebes; for their invaluable advice and limitless patience.
The Nuclear Organization Group of the Swammerdam Institute of Life Sciences; for allowing us to use their lab space and equipment.
The Institute for Biodiversity and Ecosystem Dynamics; for letting us use their climate chambers and cold storage.
Nadine Bongaerts and Eva Brinkman from BioTecture; for their help with developing our game for the night of the nerds.
Willem Fokkema; for an insightful brainstorm session on outside-the-box applications.
Tsjalling Swierstra, of the Universiteit van Maastricht; for giving us a workshop in ethics and the socio-public aspects of synthetic biology.
All Dutch iGEM teams; for the great get-togethers and moral support.
Team Yale; for sharing their anti-freeze proteins with us.
Team Stanford-Brown; for offering us the opportunity to participate in their extreme altitude balloon flight experiments.
And to all our sponsors; for their most generous support.
Thank you all!

The Team
The team consists of seven students from Amsterdam's two universities: the VU and the UvA. In the short paragraphs below, you can find out about who they are and what role they play in team iGEM Amsterdam 2011.
Jantine Broek
Paul v. Dieken
Isoude Kuijper
Jorick Mul
Sandra v. d. Nat
Bas Stringer
Yuri v. Warmerdam
Jantine Broek
Studies: Biomolecular Sciences
Team Role: Public Relations and fund raising
As a biochemistry and biophysics major, Jantine is interested in what makes cells tick on the molecular level. She chooses to participate in iGEM not only for the interesting research, but also because it is a unique opportunity to develop other skills invaluable to scientific research: PR, sponsoring, communication, creative skills and, of course, the subtle art of teamwork.
Paul van Dieken
Studies: Biomolecular Sciences
Team Role: Maintaining wiki, labwork and a bit of everything else:)
Paul is currently following the Biomolecular Sciences master at the Vrije Universiteit in Amsterdam. As his main area of interests are both genomics and proteomics, iGEM provides the perfect opportunity for an exciting summerproject.  He is also interested in exploring the fascinating possibilities of creating molecular machines, as the applications of synthetic biology is not limited to the field of Biomolecular Sciences.
Isoude Kuijper
Studies: Systems Biology
Team Role: Modeler and labwork
After completing a BSc study in Biology, Isoude came to the conclusion that she would like to do some more math and modeling in her study and decided to become a System Biology student. This field of study is not only appealing because of the nice balance of biology, math and programming but also because it is a combined study of the VU and UvA. Isoude likes long walks and boardgames.
Jorick Mul
Studies: Systems Biology
Team Role: Deadline manager and labwork
After completing a BSc study in Biochemistry, Jorick wanted to do a master study that allowed him to learn more about data processing of lab results. This is the reason he is doing the MSc ""Systems Biology"" in Amsterdam. He is intrigued with his new field of study and is very happy to be a part of this iGEM team. His interests lie mostly in music and drumming. Of course he also likes partying with his team members.
Sandra van der Nat
Studies: Biology spec. Science communication
Team Role: Public Relations, fund raising and maintaining wiki
Sandra is following the Biology master at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, where she specializes in Science communication and Ecology. Her interests lie in translating scientific discoveries into a language that everyone can understand. This makes iGEM a real challenge. In the team she mainly focuses on PR and fundraising, allowing her to translate the labwork of her teammates for the rest of the world to understand, and explaining the importance of synthetic biology.
Bas Stringer
Studies: Systems Biology
Team Role: Lab Manager and modeler
Having completed a BSc study in Biology, Bas decided to continue at the VU, studying Systems Biology. His interests include molecular and microbial biology, programming and modelling. He plays bass guitar in a band, practices dim mak and karate, and likes to party as much as the next student, if not slightly more so.
Yuri van Warmerdam
Studies: Systems Biology
Team Role: Protocol design and lab work
Having completed his Bsc in Biochemistry, Yuri is continuing his studies in the Msc in Systems Biology. He is most interested in combining lab work with computer modeling. He also strongly believes in the ability of Synthetic Biology to create sustainable energy sources and cradle to cradle consumer products. In his spare time he likes gaming, comics and hosting parties in his beautiful new house.

Supervisors
The team is under the supervision of different teachers and scientists from Amsterdam’s two universities: the VU and the UvA. In the short paragraphs below you can find out about who they are and what role they play in team iGEM Amsterdam 2011.
Domenico Bellomo
Pernette Verschure
Bas Teusink
Douwe Molenaar
Frederic Cremazy
Lisette Anink
Diewertje Piebes
Dr. Domenico Bellomo
Department: Molecular Cellphysiology, VU
Team role: Instructor
Domenico is a postdoc in the Systems Bioinformatics IBIVU at the VU University Amsterdam. Trained as an electrical engineer with a specialization in systems and control theory, he now enjoys himself as a computational biologist. He is interested in understanding the decision & control machinery of the cell (systems biology), and in tinkering with it (synthetic biology). Since 2008, he has joined different iGEM teams  as instructor and is still not fed up with it...
Dr. Pernette Verschure
Department: Swammerdam Institute for Life Sciences, UvA
Team role: Instructor and advisor
Pernette Verschure is Assistant Professor at the University of Amsterdam, leading a research team focusing on the rules that dictate mammalian epigenetic gene regulation using a systems and synthetic biology approach. She is very enthusiastic about using the rational design of synthetic cell systems to uncover systems behavior ultimately providing tools and solutions for public health problems. Presently, Pernette is instructor and advisor of the iGEM team. Pernette is exceedingly positive about student learning through the iGEM competition, since it clearly stimulates creativity of multidisciplinary students. It also gives students a taste of their future careers as independent scientists by making them responsible for their own fund raising and PR as well as socio-public awareness.
Prof. dr. Bas Teusink
Department: Molecular Cellphysiology, VU
Team role: Advisor
Bas Teusink studied (bio)chemistry in Amsterdam and obtained his PhD in theoretical biochemistry at the University of Amsterdam in 1999. In 2008 he became full professor in Systems Biology, in particular Integrative Bioinformatics, at the VU University Amsterdam. His group focuses on understanding the regulation of metabolic networks using a combination of theory and modeling, quantitative experimentation and laboratory evolution experiments.
Dr. Douwe Molenaar
Department: Molecular Cellphysiology, VU
Team role: Advisor
Douwe studied biology in Groningen, and obtained a PhD degree in molecular microbiology. He then moved to the fields of theoretical biochemistry (Amsterdam), microbial bioenergetics & enzymology (Duesseldorf) and genomics and bioinformatics (Wageningen and Ede). The recurring interests in these fields are evolutionary biology, extracting knowledge from data and modeling of life. Currently Douwe is a researcher in the Systems Bioinformatics group of Bas Teusink at the VU University.
Dr. Frederic Cremazy
Department: Swammerdam Institute for Life Sciences, UvA
Team role: Bench supervisor
F. Crémazy is Assistant Professor at the University of Versailles St Quentin in France and guest at the University of Amsterdam. He aims to unravel the connection between nuclear architecture, chromatin structure and gene expression using imaging and molecular biology. He is one of the bench supervisors of the team.
Lisette Anink MSc.
Department: Swammerdam Institute for Life Sciences, UvA
Team role: Bench supervisor
Lisette is a PhD student at the University of Amsterdam doing her thesis on epigenetic gene regulation in the group of Pernette Verschure. She is trying to change the regulatory state of genes by changing their epigenetic environment. If she had heard of iGEM while she was still a student Lisette would have joined the team. Now she has to be content with being a supervisor.
Ing. Diewertje Piebes
Department: Swammerdam Institute for Life Sciences, UvA
Team role: Bench supervisor
Diewertje Piebes is a PhD student at the University of Amsterdam, aiming to unravel the connection between chromatin structures, transcription, and epigenetics in time, by creating a synthetic cell system and using microscopy for single cell measurements. She is one of the team's bench supervisor.

iGEM being a competition between students, we worked as independently as possible. Once having been taught all the useful procedures, we did them on our own and analyzed the data before presenting them to the instructors and teaching assistants on our weekly meetings. We also planned the experiments needed to be done each week.
Being a small group, each student specialized on one part of the project, such as using the MITOMI or creating the T7 promoter variants. This allowed us to spend less time on learning the procedures; especially true for the microfluidics setups. The different parts of the project are detailed below, with the name of the student that worked on each task. The teaching assistants were assigned to the different tasks based on their personal competence; this does not mean that they completed the task, but rather that they taught us how to do it and answered our questions relative to it.

The Team
We are nine students that were brought together by our advisor, Eivind Almaas , to work on this project during the summer. Six of us study biotechnology, while the remaining three students on the team have background in mathematics, physics and information technology. This is the first time a university from Norway is competing in iGEM and we are all really happy to be part of this.
Most of us have not been working too much with synthetic biology before, so the process have been very educational. Since synthetic biology is a relatively new and very interesting field, we are all excited to get the opportunity to learn more about the subject. When we first got together, we came up with several project ideas that we would like to work on. After a lot of discussion we decided to make the stress sensor, mainly because we all thought the idea was really cool, and because the stress sensor had more interesting modeling aproaches than the other projects we considered. The stress sensor also seemed like a proper challenge, and since we all like a challenge, we went for it.
Until now, we've mostly been having fun in the lab. When the Trondheim weather permits it (which is not too often unfortunately), we try to take a break from the work and enjoy the summer and go barbequing. We have also arranged a street ping-pong tournament, the First international NTNU iGEM Street Ping-Pong Annual Tournament (FiNiSPPAT), which was won by Jon. Congratulations.
Student members
Anders Halgunset
Biography:
Currently starting my 5th year of Biotechnology at NTNU and will from the autumn start working on my master thesis at the Norwegian Defense Research Establishment, involving characterization of different Legionella bacteria.
I joined the iGEM team to get valuable experience and for the opportunity to have a great summer with lots of friends.
In my spare time I like to be in the lab, working. But I occasionally hang out with friends, play football, go swimming or do some staircase running.
Fun fact:
Is unofficial world champion in long distance staircase running.
Favourite lab procedure:
The one with D aNd some A.
Gunvor Røkke
Biography:
I am 23 years old, and starting my fifth year of studies on the master program of industrial chemistry and biotechnology this autumn. For my master thesis I will be investigating the mechanisms the DNA repair enzymes use when they detect base lesions in DNA.
Even though I have never been working with synthetic biology before, I have had lab courses in practically every chemistry and biotechnology course I have attended, so I have already spent quite a lot of time in the lab. Being on the iGEM team and working independently on the lab have been a great experience for me, and I have learned a lot.
My main interest outside of academia is playing violin. I have been playing since I was five years old, and I am currently leading the folk music orchestra of the students association in Trondheim.
Fun fact:
Is able to whistle and hum in two-part harmony with herself!
Favourite lab procedure:
Isolation of DNA from bacteria, and gel electrophoresis.
Jon Andreas Lorentzen
Biography:
I am 24 years old, and have studied biotechnology at NTNU for four years. I have started working on my master thesis which involves how the UTR region affects the gene expression.
I joined the iGem team because it's awsome and it's a valuable experience for me.
On my spare time I enjoy activities such as volleyball, basketball, longboarding, snowboarding, chilling, beerdrinking, movie-watching, music-listening, gaming and so on.
Fun fact:
Is a professional RPS (Rock, Paper, Scissor) player
Favourite lab procedure:
All of them
Eirik Selsaas
Biography:
I am 24 years old and have recently finished my masters thesis in biotechnology here at NTNU. The aim of my thesis was to characterize genes in Pseudomonas fluorescens that influence biosynthesis of alginate. My best field of knowledge is in prokaryotic genetics, but I also have knowledge about most other fields of molecular biology and biochemistry. My favorite type of work in iGEM is to design new systems and find out how to make them. Besides the fun I'm having working with biotechnology, I have some things that I like to do whenever I'm not at the lab. I like to go skiing (yes, I'm Norwegian), play soccer, play guitar and hang out with friends
Fun fact:
Surprisingly good at arm-wrestling.
Favourite lab procedure:
The moment you look at your gel, and all the DNA-fragments look correct.
Espen Bang Leistad
Biography:
This fall I'm starting my 5th year of biotechnology studies here at NTNU. For my master thesis I will investigate mice poop from wild type and knock-out mice which is missing a gene coding for a protein thought to be important in the immune system and establishment of normal bacterial flora in the colon.
I joined the iGEM team in order to gain some valuable lab experience before i start my work on the master thesis and because its simply sounded like great fun. There's never a boring day here at the iGEM NTNU lab/headquarter.
Fun fact:
Most handsome in the team.
Favourite lab procedure:
I love the sound of our old beadbeater machine..
Christian Page
Biography:
I am 23 years old, and starting on the second year in my master in statistics, focusing on medical science and cancer research. From before I have a bachelor's degree in biomathematics, which is a combination of biology (mostly (molecular/ecology) and mathematics/statistics. This gives me a firm background in theoretical modeling in biology, which is basically what I do on the team. My academic interest revolves around using theoretical statistics in modeling/solving medical problems.
When not at school, I can often be found on the volleyball playground, or out running.
Fun fact:
Is able to memorize 15 digits of pi and e.
Favourite lab procedure:
Turning on the PCR machine, and writing on the blackboard
Henrik Fahre Lutro
Biography:
I am 23 years old and starting at my fifth year in Applied Physics this autumn. I had little knowledge of biology before I joined the team, but I have already learned a lot and will probably learn even more. I have however experience of making models of physical systems and solving complex problems. My work will therefore mainly be to model the system to give as good understanding of the system as possible.
Fun fact:
Can move my ears
Favourite lab procedure:
Looking at DNA fragments under UV light
Adrian Ertsås Naas
Biography:
I'm 25, and will be starting my 5th year of Biotechnology at NTNU next semester. I've been doing lab-work for my master's thesis for half a year already, and will continue this fall. The project is on expression in E. coli, so I already had some experience with cloning techniques and lab-work before we started the iGEM project.
I joined the iGEM project because I saw it as a great opportunity to get more experience in the lab, and also in planning experiments and working more independently. Of course, the thought of putting together genes of our own choice to create something cool was also a big motivator!
Fun fact:
The strain of E. coli we're using was isolated from his hair.
Favourite lab procedure:
Growing culture to OD X +/- 0,01.
Tormund S. Haus
Biography:
I am 24 years old, currently studying for a Master in Computer Science. Does most of the programming and wiki design.
Fun fact:
I own a 7x7x7 Rubik's Cube, and can solve it.
Favourite lab procedure:
Drink random samples and see if they give me super powers.

I like laughing out loud till my cheeks are getting tired

I would like to (be able to) think one think at a time

People, who don't like me, say I'm bossy

If I win the lottery, I will swim in the money I won! YAY! \(^O^)/

The idea and design of the circuit was developed by the team members in the beginning of the project. The supervisors only had a consultative function.
All experiments and the modeling were planned and carried out by the team. The wet-lab team was supervised by Jan-Willem Veening. Maarten Mols advised us with the flow cytometer.
The team also took care of the sponsoring and other organisational issues.
The logo was made and designed by Judit González Barcina. For more information: http://www.sacajugo.com
We received a plasmid containing pBAD/araC sequence (Invitrogen) from Franz Bianchi of the Membrane Enzymology research group.
The Glossy Accordion menu was obtained via: http://www.dynamicdrive.com/dynamicindex17/ddaccordionmenu-glossy.htm

All work on Operation ECHO, including Wet Lab Experiments, Modeling and Wiki Designing, was done by the team members during the past few months.
Additionally, we get our basic Wet-Lab training from the team's advisor, Dr Chen(陈阳) and lab teacher Ms Yang.
Also some java-script used in my web-designing is acquired from the jQuery library .
Operation ECHO could not have been accomplished without the effort of every AutoGemers!
To Those we gave our deep appreciation
Ms. Yang and Dr. Chen for instructing us in strain construction.
Dr. Wang  for instructing on our model building.
Dr. Chen  for advices on prototype design.

Tsinghua-A 2011 iGEM Team consists of 8 undergraduates, together with professors on biology and information acting as advisors.
The letter ‘A’ stands for ‘Automation’, for that most of our teammates come from Department of Automation, School of Information Science and Technology. With the background of EECS, we determine to achieve a harmonious combination of biology and information science in a special and innovative perspective.
This is our first year participating in iGEM. We will do our uttermost!

All work on Operation ECHO, including Wet Lab Experiments, Modeling and Wiki Designing, was done by the team members during the past few months.
Additionally, we get our basic Wet-Lab training from the team's advisor, Dr Chen(陈阳) and lab teacher Ms Yang.
Also some java-script used in my web-designing is acquired from the jQuery library .
Operation ECHO could not have been accomplished without the effort of every AutoGemers!
To Those we gave our deep appreciation
Ms. Yang and Dr. Chen for instructing us in strain construction.
Dr. Wang  for instructing on our model building.
Dr. Chen  for advices on prototype design.

University
Harbin Institute of Technology (HIT) was founded in 1920, initially known as Harbin Sino-Russian School for Industry. HIT sets a very high standard in education. As a prestigious institution in China, HIT is known for its achievements in science and engineering areas for several decades. A 2009 analysis of research citations by Thomson Reuters Essential Science Indicators found HIT among the top 1% of institutions in the fields of Material Science, Chemistry, Engineering and Physics, and No.9 in the number of theses published in the area of Material Science worldwide. HIT has a high-level research faculty of over 2900 full-time teaching and research faculty, including 22 academicians of the Chinese Academy of Science and the Chinese Academy of Engineering. In recent years, the faculty and students have made great contribution to the development of the Chinese aerospace, especially the success of Shenzhou series spacecraft. In April 2004, the “Experimental Satellite No.1” was launched successfully, which was the first applicable small satellite developed by a Chinese university. Taking talent cultivation as a task, HIT will draw on its heritage of excellence and make full use of its comprehensive advantages to mold itself into world-class universities and contribute to the prosperity of the nation.

Where we're from
UNIVERSITY OF COPENHAGEN's iGEM team consist of 5 Molecular Biomedicine-, 2 Biochemistry- and 1 Biotechnology undergraduate(s)
MOLECULAR BIOMEDICINE:
Molecular Biomedicine is a branch of medical science that applies biological and other natural-science principles to clinical practice. Biomedicine involves the study of patho- and physiological processes with methods from biology, chemistry and physics with the particular point of view of devising new strategies for diagnosis and therapy. The program in Molecular Biomedicine is one of Denmark's elite programs, with extra funding from the Ministry of Science and Technology. The curriculum is focused on experimental work with the molecular biology of human disease and is a joint effort between the two faculties of science and health, both on the same campus in Copenhagen.
BIOCHEMISTRY:
Biochemistry is a wide field involving the study of living systems, their composition, and chemical makeup and reactions. This includes the processes for how living systems obtain energy, react to disease and pass characteristics from one generation to the next. Biochemistry has a wide range of applications, from studying plants in order to create disease or drought-resistant crops, to studying diseases in order to create better medicines.
BIOTECHNOLOGY:
Biotechnology is a field of applied biology that involves the use of living organisms and bioprocesses in engineering,technology, medicine and other fields requiring bioproducts. Biotechnology also utilizes these products for manufacturing purpose. Modern use of similar terms includes genetic engineering as well as cell- and tissue culture technologies. The concept encompasses a wide range of procedures (and history) for modifying living organisms according to human purposes — going back to domestication of animals, cultivation of plants, and ""improvements"" to these through breeding programs that employ artificial selection and hybridization.

Mexico
Mexico, officially named Estados Unidos Mexicanos, is a country located in the southern part of North America. It is bordered on the north by the United States; on the south and west by the Pacific Ocean; on the southeast by Guatemala, Belize, and the Caribbean Sea; and on the east by the Gulf of Mexico. It is the fifth largest country in the Americas and the fourteenth largest country in the world. The current population is estimated above 112 million, mostly Spanish-speakers.
According to the World Tourism Organization, Mexico is the main tourist destination in Latin America and one of the ten most visited countries in the world. Mexico also counts with one of the most diverse climates in the world, considered one of the 12 most diverse countries. It is home to the 10-12% of global biodiversity and to over 12 000 endemic species.
Mexico in the world.
Monterrey City
Monterrey is a Mexican city, capital of Nuevo León, as well as head of the urban area that bears the name: Monterrey Metropolitan Area. It is the third most populous city in Mexico, after the metropolitan areas of Mexico, D.F. and Guadalajara, Jalisco. As a city, Monterrey is known for its great industrial activity, and one of the greatest centers for technological and commercial interchange in Latin America.
It is also known for its business and service centers. Its industries include: cement manufacturing, beer, glass, steel and food products. It is one of the most accessible cities in the country, with close connections to the U.S. border. It is surrounded by impressive natural wonders, such as the majestic mountains of the Sierra Madre Oriental (English: Eastern Sierra Madre Mountain Range), and ""Cerro de la Silla"" (English: Saddle Hill), which is the immutable symbol of the city. It also has many theaters, art galleries and sporting venues, as well as regional and international restaurants.
Monterrey, Nuevo León.
Universidad Autónoma de Nuevo León
The Universidad Autónoma de Nuevo León (UANL) is the third largest public university in Mexico and the most important institution of higher learning in Northeastern Mexico, which offers the highest number of academic programs. The UANL is one of the oldest universities in Mexico. It began as a School of Law in 1824, and later the Civil Academy and the School of Medicine were founded in 1859. Through the years, its reputation for outstanding academic achievement has become known throughout the country, and it reflects the intellectual achievement of its students as well as the innovative research carried out by its faculty.
The UANL has seven distinct campuses: the Main Campus, which houses the Administration Building, Colleges of Law, Biology School, Chemistry, Public Accounting and Philosophy, among others, as well as the Football Stadium, and other sport facilities. Other campuses include the Health Sciences Campus, the Mederos Humanities and Fine Arts Campus, the Marin Agronomy Center, the Escobedo Agricultural Sciences Campus, the Linares Earth Sciences, and Forestry campus:

Photochassis
Since light induction is becoming increasingly used in synthetic biology, we decided to create a built-in light induction system in E. coli through chromosome insertion. Avoiding the need of any extra-chromosomal DNA when light-inducing gene expression offers several advantages to the researcher. We therefore propose these modified E. coli strains as photochassis that could make useful tools in the field.
Chromosome integration will be performed through a two-step method for the insertion of large DNA fragments into any desired location in the E. coli chromosome, designed by Kuhlman and Cox [1] . Light induction genes will be obtained from plasmids constructed by Dr. Jeff J. Tabor (2010) [2] .
Ideally, three photochassis will be built: the first enabling green light induction, the second enabling red-light induction, and the third enabling both green and red lights induction in the same cell. A common chromophore is shared by the three strains. All genes and biobricks used for this purpose are listed at the bottom of the page.
Red Photochassis
Red Photochassis. Genes ho1 and pcyA are responsible for the chromophore synthesis. Cph8 codes for the chimaeric red-light receptor [3] . These three genes are constitutively expressed. Mnt repressor is expressed from pOmpC promoter, which stops being induced in presence of red-light. It is therefore used as a NOT-gate to regulate expression from pMnt (see Circuit Cell One ).
Red photochassis.
Green Photochassis
Green Light Photochassis. Genes ho1 and pcyA are responsible for the chromophore synthesis. CcaS and CcaR code for the two-component green-light receptor. Absorption of green light increases the rate of CcaS autophosphorylation, phosphotransfer to CcaR, and transcription from the promoter of the CpcG2 promoter [2] . All four genes are constitutively expressed.
Green photochassis.
Red and Green Photochassis
Red and Green light Photochassis. Assembles both constructions above with only one chromophore synthesis complex.

iGEM-UANL2011 Official Logo. The logo represents a bacterial community that is capable of interpreting a simple light code. Light stimuli is filtrated through 532nm (green) and 650nm (red) bandpass filters, represented by the green and red glasses. Five fluorescent proteins used as reporter genes in our project are represented by the five colored gear.The logo was made and designed by Diego Cuerda.
iGEM-UANL2011 Circuit Simbol. The Circuit Symbol represents essentially the idea of ​​our project in general: the construction of a genomic circuit that works using only two inputs —the two different wavelength lights—, and gives as a response five different fluorescent proteins that are represented as the five outputs.

E. coli MxRed. Derived from Dr. Jeff Tabor JT2 E. coli strain, this part is a built-in red-light induction system in E. coli made through chromosome insertion. Avoiding the need of any extra-chromosomal DNA when light-inducing gene expression offering several advantages to the researcher.
It is proposed as a photo-chassis that could make useful tools in this field of light induction.
Integration include the genes pcyA, ho1, Cph8 and a Mnt working as follows: Genes ho1 and pcyA are responsible for the chromophore synthesis. Cph8 codes for the chimaeric red-light receptor. These three genes are constitutively expressed. Mnt repressor is expressed from pOmpC promoter, and the red light stops its induction. It is therefore used as a NOT-gate to regulate expression from pMnt.

BBa_K566042
Second State for Biphasic switch. Biphasic switch proof concept. Composite part of BBa_K566015 , BBa_K145015 , BBa_B0014 and BBa_K566039 . The biphasic switch may be used to control both expression and repression of pRM through a single input, which must control cI protein concentration. Furthermore, if repressor cI434 is placed under pRM's control along with the gene of interest, this switch may be coupled with the modified promoter pRM434 BBa_I12006 , which is stimulated by cI but repressed by cI434; hence resulting in a two-state switch controlled through a single input. The expected behavior will be the following: 1) at low concentrations of cI, both promoters will be activated. However, because of cI434 repressing pRM434, only pRM will stay ON eventually leading to the first state. 2) At high concentrations of cI, pRM -and consequently cI434- will be turned OFF, allowing pRM434 to be activated by cI and leading to a second state. pRM promoter from Phage 434 (not to confuse with pRM434 mentioned above) seems to exhibit the same biphasic behavior. This part is intended to prove the behavior shown in figure 1, using fluorescent proteins as reporter genes. It is coupled with the part K566040 , which contains the pRM434 promoter. GFP -transcribed from pRM- represents the first state, while YFP -transcribed from pRM434- represents the second state.

Construction
This page explains extensively how to build a ""Light Machine"".
Overview of the ""Light Machine""
We built a special machine that allows us to properly excite both photoreceptors (CcaS/CcaR and Cph8) independently/simultaneously using specific wavelengths of 535 and 650 nm, respectively. This ""Light Machine"" was based mainly on previous publications that work with light [1][2][3] .

Light Machine Diagram.
Instructions
First of all, collect or make all the materials shown above
Wallpaper completely the inside of the incubator with black paper.
Clear the thermometer hole in the top of incubator such that light can pass through.
Place the T-45° Block at the top of the incubator on the thermometer hole and fix it with a plastic ring.
Place two mirrors on T-45°Block.
Immobilize the bandpass filter inside a plastic 1' coupling with small plastic ring.
Join the desired coupling to the small aluminum pipe of T-45° Block.
Immobilize the emitter-receptor pieces at both sides of incubator, we use adjustable shelves.
Join the aluminum tube to the Emitter-Receptor.
Leave proper distance (two finger rule) between coupling and aluminum pipe.
Immobilize aluminum tubes with support stands.
Place the aluminum tube in Emitter-Receptor piece and place the pipes parallel to the T-45° Block.
Turn on the lamps; adjust the positioning of mirrors such that a clear and homogeneous light pattern appears in the center of your incubator.
Notes:
Have fans near Aluminum Pieces, they become very hot over time, prevents halogen lamp and filter fails.
Our incubator has a 1 3/4' hole.
When placing T-45° Block ensure to cover all light penetrable areas.
Buy more than 2 halogen lamps; they break easily.
Be careful when handling the halogen lamps, they heat in a very short time.
We bought 4 BP filters 532, 575, 650, 710 nm respectively.
Make experiments in dark room.
Clean mirrors when possible.
Measure light intensity before starting test.
Light Intensities Measurements
Before starting making measurements it is necessary to understand the following concepts:
Radiometry: is the measurement of optical radiation from a physical point of view, includes the regions commonly called the ultraviolet, the visible and the infrared. Two out of many typical units encountered are Watt and Joule.
Photometry: is the measurement of visible light, which is detectable by the human eye. These measurements tend to be subjective.  Typical photometric units include lumens, lux and candelas.
Photometry is almost the same as radiometry, except that radiometry includes the entire optical radiation spectrum, while photometry is limited to the visible spectrum as defined by the response of the eye [4][6] .
Irradiance (a.k.a. flux density) is a SI derived unit and is measured in W/m2. Irradiance is power per unit area incident from all directions in a hemisphere onto a surface that coincides with the base of that hemisphere.
Illuminance (a.k.a. luminous flux density) is another SI unit and is measured in lux. Illuminance is the total luminous flux incident on a surface per unit area. (Is the photometric equivalent of irradiance) [5] .
**In a few words you need to measure in photometric units (lux) and convert them to radiometric units (W/m2) or measure directly in W/m2
There are two typical kinds of devices to measure light intensities once having assembled the ""Light Machine"":
Photometer - is an instrument for measuring Illuminance (Photometric units), then this value will be converted into Irradiance (W/m2).
**Cheaper measurement device and works properly.
Photometer.
Spectrometer – is an instrument for measuring Irradiance.
**Is the device that has everything but it costs much more
Spectrometer.
Determining light Intensities
The intensity of light was measured in lux units, lumens per square meter using an Easy View Light Meter (Model EA31) calibrated photometer, which later were converted to power units of Watts per square meter.
The light beam was divided into zones, which underwent an average of intensities in the X, Y-axis to determine the intensity of that area. Intensity averages were calculated before each test. Samples were placed in the zone that better fits the desired intensity.
The Bandpass interference filters have a 10 nm transmission window with a peak at the emission wavelength.  Precise light wavelengths and intensities are very important to achieve the desired response of photoreceptors.
How to convert to from lux to W/m2
Radiometric and photometric units can be converted into each other [6] . Several factors, such as wavelength and mono/multicromatic light source must be take into account.
The conversion between photometric and radiometric units, for a monochromatic light source, is given by the following equation:
K(λ) = Km*V(λ)
Where:
K(λ) - Radiant flux (lm/W)
V(λ) - Photo tropic spectra  luminous efficiency function. Corresponds to the sensitivity of the human eye and its function of the wavelength of light (Fig 2 Appendix B) [6]
Km – Scaling Factor: 683 lm/W
**Remember that this formula is effective only for monochromatic light sources (Multicromatic light sources are a bit more complicated).
**Observe measurement device modality (Photopic or Scotopic)**
 
Example of conversion from photometric to radiometric units for a 532 nm wavelength:
K(λ) = Km* V(λ)
K(532 nm) = 683 lm/W *V(532nm)
K(532 nm) = 683 lm/W * 0.862
K(532 nm) = 588.746 lm/W
 
1 W = 588.76 lm @ 532 nm
1 W/m2 = 588.79 lm/m2 ; 1 lux = 1 lm/m2
1 lux = 1/588.79 W/m2 = 1.69 mW/m2 @ 532 nm
Now calculate your respective intensities for your experiment.
Correlation W/m2 to Lux @532nm
Correlation W/m2 to Lux @650nm
Correlation W/m2 to Lux @710nm
Intensity/Wavelength
The light intensity on the sample depends mainly on 3 factors:
Distance - Is inversely proportional to the light output
Lamp light output - Depending on the type of lamp, it will produce different wavelength intensities.
Specific Wavelength.
Consider the light loss during the pathway.
It is very important to have the correct intensity/wavelenght (W/m2 for @ nm) for each photoreceptor, otherwise it may produce unwanted results.
1) Two-color optical control of gene expression in E. coli. Light intensity transfer functions of strains carrying each sensor alone or both sensors. Strains expressing the green sensor only CcaS/CcaR (green circles), red sensor only Cph8 (red squares), or both (gray circles) were exposed to varying intensities of 532 nm or 650 nm light. 2) Spectral transfer functions. E. coli carrying the green or red sensor was exposed to saturating levels of a given light wavelength, and Miller assays were conducted. Figures taken from Tabor JJ et al. (2010) J. Mol. Biol. 405: 315-324.

Introduction
In our Project, one of the main contributions has been the generation of a new genetic circuit construction standard called ""UANL Bricks Assembly"". This standard has arisen from the need of an alternative way for device construction from pieces containing some of the restrictions sites of the classic biobrick standard, besides having the ability to have more options when performing cuts and ligations of the genetic elements. The structure and origin of our new standard is explained next.
At the time of carrying out  the device construction to integrate, the main idea was use the classic biobrick standard.  However, it was observed that some of the genetic elements used for this construction had the PstI, EcoRI y SpeI sites, avoiding it from being used.
Description
For these reasons, we opted for the generation of a new standard that will meet our needs. That was why we generated the UANL Bricks, having the following structure:
The main reasons why we chose these sites is explained next:
ApaI Site: This site was chosen because of its wide distributed in the polylinkers of many of the most used vectors in molecular biology.
SpeI and XbaI sites: Coming from the Biobrick classic standard, these sites generated compatibles sticky ends which can be used for the union of elements of interest. However,  its important to point that the SpeI site is present in our ccas gene.
XhoI and SalI sites: Due to the complications presented in the ccas gene, it was necessary to introduce a second set of sites for the union of elements, which in this case were XhoI and SalI sites. Further, the SalI site also could be use like PstI was it in the classic standard because it's present en most of the vectors polylinkers.
The use of this second pair of sites allow us to have versatility at the moment of the elements union for the generation of devices or circuits in a Biobrick way, increasing the variability of options for constructions.
Therefore, If the parts do not have XbaI or SpeI inside of them, construction could be performed using ApaI and SalI as EcoRi and PstI, respectively. However, if the parts do have Xba or SpeI sites, the constructions could be performed as show in the following scheme.
Specifications
The next subject to evaluate of our new standard was the viability, reason why we did a search of the economics, practical and useful aspects of the chosen enzymes.
First, we did a search for the prices, concentrations and compatibility of the used enzymes, obtaining the first two aspects was equivalent in both standards (classic and UANL bricks), besides they all work at 100% in buffer 4 of New England Biolabs.
Also, we evaluated the capacity of these enzymes to cleavage close to the end of linear DNA fragments, which would be useful when directly cut PCR products.
Finally, we search the distributions of UANL Brick's sites in vectors used in molecular biology, in order to know which ones could be used for cloning. In this study we include vectors from companies like Fermentas ®, Promega ®, Invitrogen ®, New England Biolabs ®, besides the classic biobrick vector pSB1A2.

Brian Pfleger PhD.:
Brian Pfleger received his PhD after studying in the laboratory of Jay D. Keasling at Cal-Berkeley where he developed metabolic engineering methods to enhance the biosynthesis of pharmaceuticals. This experience trained him to design, construct and evaluate strains of Escherichia coli for the production of small molecules by integrating synthetic and systems biology. After graduating, he accepted a postdoctoral fellowship (NIH-GLRCE) in the laboratory of David H. Sherman at the University of Michigan, where he studied six Bacillus anthracis enzymes and how they assembled a complex natural product essential for iron acquisition and pathogenesis. Research in the Sherman lab exposed him to the combinatorial nature of natural product biosynthesis and taught him how to work with these novel enzymes. His current interest is engineering sustainable chemical production using synthetic biology.
Tyler Youngquist:
Tyler Youngquist is a PhD student in the Pfleger lab at UW-Madison in the Department of Chemical and Biological Engineering. He is working with large scale fermentations to produce valuable small molecules such as fatty acids with metabolically engineered strains of E. coli. He helped answer the iGEM team's myriad questions over the summer, and provided them with invaluable goodies like plasmids, cells, and fluorescent markers.

Hi~My name is Zhilin Chen   \(^o^)/ and I'm a sophomore student in life science department of USTC. Greatly attractied by synthetic biology, I chose to take part in iGEM2011 team,UTSC-China.I not only learnt a lot about Synthetic Biology,practiced my experimental skills,also, I believe it's worthwhile to spend time and energy to our promising project, which will certainly pay back. As for myself, outgoing, optimistic, considerate are all my characters,yet sometimes I could be really sentimental and depressed. Now I'm looking forward to the 2011 Jambooree and making friends with a common goal.
Fangzhou Zhao
Hi,everyone!I am Zhao Fangzhou, a sophomore student majoring in Life Science in USTC. Born in the autumn of 1991, I was lucky enough to enjoy a 21-year life filled with happiness and sadness. Shangrao, located in the northeast of Jiangxi Province, is the very place where I was brought up. This beautiful town, positioned in Southern China, with its natural scenery and cultural heritage, has been teaching me how to handle with my own life and with the whole world. Over the years before, I have developed interests in a variety of occupations, like reading books, playing computer games and various ball games. However, since the day I was admitted into USTC, I began to devote much of my time to studying, and correspondingly cut down the time spent on after-class activities, expecting that two years later, I can walk out of this university without any regret.

Young as we are,
only dreams can be the wings.
Where is the will,there is the way.
Everytime we fail
Everytime we want to say
no we can't
or even
Sometime when we feel
everything we have done are nothing
but the moon in the deep well
Someone is there...

Since the research strategy of systems biology is well fit to analyze the biological complex systems. I am applying this strategy on the mechanism of the complex diseases such as cancer and diabetes. My ongoing project is to identify biomarkers in order to detect the progress stages of the diabetes. As a metabolic disease, diabetes-related proteins tend to enter the circulation system, thus the biomarker discovery in plasma has the potential to play an important role in the early detection and treatment of diabetes. We have developed systematic approaches based on proteomics and bioinformatics to analyze human normal and diabetic serum. In addition, I have planed to analyze the genetic and environmental factors and their interactions during the progressing of the type 2 diabetes with systems-biology approaches.

I am a senior student majoring in systems biology in university of science and technology of China.Excellence in learning is not only in my biological field ,but also in many other subjects which I am interested in ,such as history ,mythology ,philosophy and Linguistics. Especially in the language learning ,I have learned German ,Japanese ,Italian and a little Egyptian hieroglyphs by myself. In my own professional field ,I particularly focus on the studying of systems biology and synthetic biology ,therefore ,besides learning and studying in the Computational Biology Laboratory of USTC ,I also took part in the iGEM(International Genetically Engineered Machine) team to design the blueprint of the project ,experimental protocols and safety standards.
Zhilin Chen
Hi~My name is Zhilin Chen   and I'm a sophomore student in life science department of USTC. Greatly attracted by synthetic biology, I chose to take part in iGEM2011 team,UTSC-China.I have learnt a lot about Synthetic Biology and practiced my experimental skills through the process. I believe it's worthwhile to spend time and energy to our promising project, which will certainly pay back. As for myself, outgoing, optimistic, considerate are all my characters,yet sometimes I could be really sentimental and depressed. Now I'm looking forward to the 2011 Jambooree and making friends with all of you.
Fangzhou Zhao
Hi,everyone!I am Zhao Fangzhou, a sophomore student majoring in Life Science in USTC. Born in the autumn of 1991, I was lucky enough to enjoy a 21-year life filled with happiness and sadness. Shangrao, located in the northeast of Jiangxi Province, is the very place where I was brought up. This beautiful town, positioned in Southern China, with its natural scenery and cultural heritage, has been teaching me how to handle with my own life and with the whole world. Over the years before, I have developed interests in a variety of occupations, like reading books, playing computer games and various ball games. However, since the day I was admitted into USTC, I began to devote much of my time to studying, and correspondingly cut down the time spent on after-class activities, expecting that two years later, I can walk out of this university without any regret.

The Team
We are a French team from Grenoble, a well known city for skiing and nanotechnology. We are forming a joint team between biology students from Université Grenoble 1 (Joseph Fourier University)  and engineer students from Grenoble INP Phelma (Grenoble Institute of technology) that have taken some more specialized courses in biotechnology.
The team will be composed of 11 students that will work in 7 different laboratories (lab directors in parentheses):
2 microbiology laboratories (H. Geiselmann, I. Attree)
3 laboratories of biotechnology (F. Bruckert, O. Peyret, D. Peyrade)
1 Fundamental research laboratory  (R. Calemczuk,)
1 bioinformatics laboratory (H. de Jong).

Geoffrey Bouchage
2nd year of Engineering School in Biotechnologies
Grenoble Institute of Technolgy PHELMA
Hi everyone! I'm Geoffrey and I come from Albertville, city of the Olympics  1992. I'm a big big fan of the Vancouver Canucks and I'm sorry for the MIT but I don't think Boston will win the Stanley Cup this year! I'm french so I'm totally in love with cheese, bread and wine. You can find here the best food in the whole world! Try it is to adopt it. iGEM ​​is for me a wonderful life experience that I could not miss.
Felix Ciceron
M1 Molecular and Cellular Biology
Grenoble University Joseph FOURIER
I am Felix Ciceron and I am studying molecular and cellular biology at the University Joseph Fourier in Grenoble, France.  I would like to work in bioremediation, bio-detection of pollution, or enzymatic engineering.  All of these fields require both laboratory and project  skills.  I believe the iGEM competition is a tremendous way to get experience of working in a team, as it combines the spirit of competition with learning.
Marion Cristea
2nd year of Engineering School in Biotechnologies
Grenoble Institute of Technolgy PHELMA
Hey Folks! If you've started Clement's and Geoffrey's descriptions, you'll probably believe that we are obsessed by food. As French people, it's true. But we are also interested in many other things. For example, as you, I decided to launch into this Great Human Adventure because I'm convinced that Synthetic Biology is the futur and I'm looking forward to meet people from everywhere. Sport also represents a large part of my hobbies: running, cross-country biking, swimming, climbing... One last thing to fit with the French stereotype! Even if I come from the Alpes, I prefere dishes from the South like Ratatouille, Bouillabaisse or Soupe au Pistou.
Morgane DeGasperi
M1 Molecular and Cellular Biology
Grenoble University Joseph FOURIER
Hi everyone! I’m Morgane, and I come from Grenoble. Logic? Well no! As Grenoble is one of the best student cities, almost the entire team doesn’t come from here.  On the other side, I prefer listen music rather than sports making: I have never skied. The participation to iGEM is a unique experience, to have an approach of synthetic biology but is also a human adventure. And I’m proud to participate.
Eric Durandeau
M1 Molecular and Cellular Biology
Grenoble University Joseph FOURIER
My ambition is to become a researcher, at the interphase of microbiology and immunology. moreover, my other passion are badminton, makeshift job, and informatic. iGEM is really in line with my love for biology. I think this adventure will give to me a great experience and plunge myself in the scientifc world, and show up some meeting with differents people who have alternative science-thinking.
Maxime Huet
2nd year of Engineering School in Biotechnologies
Grenoble Institute of Technolgy PHELMA
Dear competitor, I did not have the pleasure to grow up between the beautiful mountains of the Alps. But since I'm studying in Grenoble, I'm taking the opportunity to go skiing or hiking. What better feeling than to admire this awesome landscape and thinking to the tartiflette waiting for your return in the sweet heat of your beloved home ?
Beside this ""food's poetry""  I'm studying physics (many different stuff, nuclear, optic, IT, modeling, a spoonful of electronic) and biotechnology at Phelma an engineering school. I like science in general, I practice archery and I'm very fond of rollerskating.
Jean-Baptiste Lugagne
2nd year of Engineer School in signal processing
Grenoble INP PHELMA
Hi all. I'm a student in information technology, therefore i became the IT guy of the group. Some would say I'm the shepherd of the group but I prefer to see myself as a glimmer of hope for my biologist teammates when their pc crashes down. But don't think I live in symbiosis with my computer, like most of Grenoblois I like outdoor activities such as trail, skiing or climbing.
Clément Masson
M1 Molecular and Cellular Biology
Grenoble University Joseph FOURIER
Hey! I'm a student in microbiology and genetic engeenering. I participate to iGEM because it's an extraordinary opportunity to work on genetic engineering, and to have a real lab' life experience. Otherwise, what can I say, I come from Albertville like Geoffrey, incidentally I think he is right about cheese,bread and wine. I don't no what can I say moreover, so I think I will leave you with an expression from Savoie : ""Qui boit trop de gnole casse la bagnole!""
Feriel Melaine
Master 2 Nanosciences
Grenoble Université Joseph FOURIER
Hi to all of you!!!
I’m Feriel (alias Fifi) from Joseph Fourier University where I’m finishing my Master in Nanobiotechnology. Ever since I can remember, I have been fascinated by what Life Science might achieve, especially by designing new living processes that, I’m sure, will really cause major scientific advancements in the future. So when one of our teacher mentioned the possibility to join Grenoble iGEM team, it immediately excited me and I was determined to  participate! This competition is definitely a unique opportunity to learn about life science, experience new things, meet other people and work in a team, all at the same time! An exceptional adventure in few words! Apart from iGEM, I like to cook Kessra and Boureks (Algerian specialties)… I had to talk about food!
Samia Menad
Master 2 Nanosciences
Grenoble Université Joseph FOURIER
Hello everyone, I’m Samia, I am student in second year of Nanosciences research master, specialty nanobiology, I love biology especially when it is associated with other scientific  fields like physics. My participation in the iGEM Grenoble -Team is due to my interest in synthetic biology, I am highly motivated and curious about the project and I am glad to have the opportunity to extend my knowledge in this field. I believe the iGEM is a great human adventure for every member team.
Robin Pinilla
M1 Health and drugs engineer
Grenoble University Joseph FOURIER
Student in first year of master degrees of engineering for health and drugs (mmm drugs...) speciality biotechnologies, I am particularly interested in cell engienering and biological expression systems. In this context, I find that the iGEM, plus that beeing a great learning tool, is a unique opportunity for students to participate in a project of engineering bacteria from the idea to the functional biological system.
Advisor
Stéphane Pinhal

I am a microbiologist at the university of Grenoble. In the past, I have combined biophysics, molecular biology and bacteriology to understand the functioning of Escherichia coli. More recently, in a systems biology approach, I have used precise measurements of gene expression to test predictions of mathematical models of the corresponding regulatory system. Synthetic biology, and thus iGEM, is the next step in understanding biological systems: if we really understand the functioning of a system, we can modify its behavior. In iGEM we move from designing a desired behavior to instantiating the network in the real organism: a formidable challenge in interdisciplinary research and a very stimulating endeavor, in large parts thanks to a team of excellent and motivated students from different backgrounds.

To my point of view, the most interesting aspect of the iGEM project is the collective construction of a new way of doing bioengineering. The modular approach is clearly more efficient in terms of experimental effort and it also helps understanding how cellular functions are organized. Implementing new functions in bacteria should in turn help to build up more efficient ways to represent the living beings complexity. Besides that, I like  and challenges and iGEM is all of this.
Marianne Weidenhaupt
LMGP
Grenoble INP
I am a biology and immunology teacher at the Grenoble Institute of Technology-Phelma. One of the important points of my teaching is to train students to be able to work at the interface of different scientific disciplines. iGem is a very exciting challenge that plunges us straight into interdisciplinarity and puts teachers and students face to face with what we aim for in our daily work. Personally I worked in bacterial genetics during my PhD, a field I left some 15 years ago and which I am more than happy to work in again with our team.

I am a researcher in bioinformatics and mathematical biology at INRIA Grenoble - Rhône-Alpes. I am particularly interested in the modeling of bacterial regulatory networks.
Delphine Ropers

Grenoble
Graduated in Biochemistry,  I developed a strong interest for pluridisciplinarity in the course of my training. I received a PhD in Molecular Biology from Nancy University for my work on the regulation of HIV-1 RNA alternative splicing by modeling and experimental approaches. I am now a researcher within the Systems Biology group Ibis at Inria Grenoble - Rhône-Alpes, a French research institute in computer science and control. I work on the mathematical modeling and experimental validation of biochemical regulatory networks involved in bacterial adaptation to environmental cues.

Dr. Robert Baptist, physicist, is Research Director at CEA.  He is an author or a co-author of 60 publications and 15 patents. He has recently leaded the interdisciplinary and transversal CEA program ChimTronique on chemistry applied to nanoelectronics. Today, he participates to the scientific animation of MINATECÒ and enjoys the active contact with the newly created Grenoble iGEM group.
Roberto Calemczuk

SPRAM
I am a physicist working at the CEA-Grenoble. My research field is mainly focused on bioanalytical devices, in particular on new methods for the rapid detection and the study of bacteria. My idea in the IGM context is to marry together two domains of excellence in Grenoble: microtechnology and bacteriology.

From 2011.igem.org
Acknowledgement
Would any of your project ideas raise safety issues in terms of: researcher safety, public safety, or environmental safety?
Do any of the new BioBrick parts (or devices) that you made this year raise any safety issues?
Is there a local biosafety group, committee, or review board at your institution? What does your local biosafety group think about your project?
Do you have any other ideas how to deal with safety issues that could be useful for future iGEM competitions? How could parts, devices and systems be made even safer through biosafety engineering?
Would any of your project ideas raise safety issues in terms of: researcher safety, public safety, or environmental safety?
Parts, ideas, and strains of model organisms in the 2011 HKUST iGEM team will not pose any threat to safety of researchers, public or environment. All biological parts, when functioning correctly, should not produce toxins or harmful chemicals to other organisms. Model organisms used include Escherichia coli DH10b, BW25113 and BW25141. They are non-virulent strains and are common in microbiology laboratories for basic biology studies.
Top
Do any of the new BioBrick parts (or devices) that you made this year raise any safety issues?
The new BioBrick parts that are currently under design encode non-hazardous genes and should be harmless, with only one exception. That BioBrick part might slightly raise the resistance of Escherichia coli to certain antibiotics, but the effect will be limited to the bacteria cultured for testing experiments.  The part encodes a multi-efflux pump that mainly transports aminoglycosides out of the cytosol. Yet we believe it does not have significant impact on the general safety of the environment since, in theory, it would only raise the minimum inhibition concentration (MIC) of the host organism by no more than 10 µg/ml.
To avoid any potential hazards, Biological Safety Level 1 requirements are strictly followed. Biological wastes and all equipment that have physical contacts with biological samples are bleached (optional) and autoclaved before disposal or reuse.
Top
Is there a local biosafety group, committee, or review board at your institution? What does your local biosafety group think about your project?
The Biosafety Committee of HKUST Health, Safety & Environmental Office keeps track of all safety regulations and practices in the campus. They address all issues arisen from current experimental procedures taking place and keeps an eye on ethical practices that involves the handling of genetically modified cells and animals, the latter of which does not apply in this project, since animal study will not be included in the project described here.
Procedures currently involved in iGEM 2011 HKUST team mainly concern molecular cloning and constructing reporter systems for antibiotics resistance. Constructs and parts will NOT be distributed or released to the environment. Guidelines from NIH recombinant DNA regulations are followed as closely as possible. Therefore details of our project had not, and will not evolve into any public safety issues that need to be addressed.
Top
Do you have any other ideas how to deal with safety issues that could be useful for future iGEM competitions? How could parts, devices and systems be made even safer through biosafety engineering?
We propose to include a suicide system inside all BioBrick plasmid backbones. Using toxin-antitoxin systems coupled with the appropriate promoters, we can trigger self-destruction in any cell that has taken up the plasmid using particular inducers or by subjecting undesired hosts to a slightly varied physical environment. This can safeguard against undesired gain of resistance or gain of advantage by the manipulated organism, or contaminant species that have obtained the plasmid through horizontal gene transfer.

Team:HKUST-Hong Kong/contribution.html
From 2011.igem.org
Contributions
iGEM  2011 HKUST team is composed of 29 undergraduate members, 10 advisors, and 3  instructors. Together, we have gone through successes, setbacks, and precious  moments as a team to beget the E. trojan.
The  project, starting from the proposal of its topic to its implementation and  finalization, is carried out independently by the team members. Our instructors  and advisors, however, have   provided us with great technical support and  invaluable experience sharing. Without them, there is no way the project could  reach its current state. Right now, we have submitted eight BioBrick parts, one  of which has been characterized and also a new plasmid vector. All of them were  designed and constructed through a great collaborative effort by our team members.
Laboratory work apart, our Human Practice Group also held a ""Synthetic Biology Workshop"" in September and conducted a “Synthetic Biology Survey” for the general public in Hong Kong (mostly alumni and students of HKUST). The questionnaire was disseminated from August to October this year. The lab tour in the workshop was coordinated by our instructor Dr. Jessica TANG. The survey was originated from IDC and Biofaction in Austria [kindly provided by Markus Schmidt, Lei Pei and Wolfgang Kerbe] and was further modified by our human practice team members.
Supports from external parties on data evaluation are documented in details on our Acknowledgements page.

1. Professor King-Lau CHOW, Division of Life Science
2. Dr. Jessica Ce Mun TANG, Division of Life Science
3. Ms. Kit NG, Division of Life Science
Advisors:
1. Julie
iGEM has always been surprising me with its vivid illustration of how powerful synthetic biology can possibly be.
2. Audrey
The two years' iGEM experience has enhanced my understanding of Synthetic Biology and love for this promising scientific field. iGEM is a learning process with both pains and fun.
3.Yimo
I am a positive person crazy for both sports and life science. I really enjoy the great time with all the other members, advisors and instructors, from whom I learned quite a lot. Things were so great, thank you guys!
4. Wendy Lu & 5. Rory
We really enjoyed the process of understanding and solving problems, with all our fellow teammates, advisors and instructors, using every bit of our intellect and dedication. It is great to witness the 2011 team grow & good luck to HKUST iGEM 2011!
6. Jack
During my second year of iGEM, I found myself entering a deeper level of the life science world and have a deeper bonding with my fellow teammates.
7. Hanson
iGEM is a great place where we not only share our ideas, but also realize them by working as a team.This year, as an advisor, I witnessed the development of a brand new iGEM team, which was exciting and inspiring.
Team members:
1. Trevor
By manipulating genes we imitate the creations of God, and from failures I learned that the All Mighty patented his creations.
2. Jinny
3. Peter
4. Steven
Thanks to iGEM, I have precious experience of working cooperatively with all of my teammates and achieving our goals as a whole.
5. Max
6. Kwan
7. Claire
Even though today we are still at a preliminary stage, we are doomed to master it one day. Besides,the stronger the power, the more careful we should be.
8. Cynthia Chen
Thanks to iGEM, I have really learned a lot during this summer. It's great to have a whole team working together for our goal. We love iGEM~
9. Nathaniel
iGEM reflects many realities of scientific research, especially the need to do the mundane repeatedly to obtain success. YET, the best part of all, still, is when you receive the sequencing sheet, and realize that your construct is present and correct. Exhilarating!
Team members:
1. Theodore
Being on the iGEM team this year was an inspiring experience. I enjoyed the time spent in the lab debating over our data, not unlike the kind of thrill you feel when you place a piece of jigsaw puzzle into the right location.
2. Cynthia Wang
3. Michael
4. Yellow
Synthetic biology is extremely interesting, especially when you deal with the little and cute lives that can not be seen by naked eyes. Based the current knowledge, actually what we can control is not so much and it always gives us a lot of surprise.
5. Julia
6. Wendy Xu
7. Shirley
I really enjoy the days spent with my smart groupmates in this year's iGEM and hope other participants can share the same experience with me.
8. Jeff
9. Vincent
In the project, I am very delighted to learn different wet lab skills like miniprep. and aseptic techniques. Moreover, I met many friends from different places and I was happy to chat with them. Thank you so much for iGEM HKUST.

Year 2010
Biocontamination Kit
 We’ve developed a strategy for heavy metal bioreporter and bioabsorbent engineering, based on reverse engineering principle, which will help us to break the limitation of our current knowledge and research method. As MerR family TFs share highly conserved homology and most kinds of heavy metals have corresponding MerR family TFs(Brown et al., 2003; Hobman, 2007; Hobman et al., 2005; Julian et al., 2009), we can state that we have developed an extensible method to construct heavy metal decontamination kits composed of valid bioreporters and bioabsorbents for field application in the near future.

Year 2009
Conditioned Reflex Mimicking in E.coli
We are engineering our E.coli cells to process the correlation information of two environmental signal, similar to the process of classical conditioning in higher organisms. In our circuits we use a bistable switch as the memory module to represent the memory state; we also constructed a series of AND gates which can sense conditioned and unconditioned signals, and output a repressor protein to change the memory state of the bistable switch. In this way, our E.coli cells can convert the information on the concurrence of two signals to its memory. After the memory module is switched, given the conditioned stimulus, E.coli will activate its reporter module and thus exhibit the ""conditioned response"".

Year 2008
A Genetic Circuit for Directed Evolution in vivo
Directed evolution is a powerful tool for answering scientific questions or constructing novel biological systems. Here we present a simple genetic circuit for in vivo directed evolution which comprises minimal elements for random mutation and artificial selection. We engineer yeast to generate the DNA mutator hAID, an essential protein in adaptive immunity, and target it specifically to a gene of interest. The target gene will be mutated and consequently promptly evolves. By linking the expression of hAID repressor LacI and favorite gene functionality, the mutation rate inversely correlates between the functionality of the desired gene and hAID. This circuit may be adopted for in vivo evolution in eukaryotic system on genetically encoded targets. It has a variety of potential applications in academic and industrial contexts, theoretically most inter-molecular interaction that involves proteins and RNAs.

Year 2007
Towards Self-differentiated Bacterial Assembly Line
Our projects concern with the ability for bacterial cells to differentiate out of homogeneous conditions into populations with the division of labor. We aim at devices conferring host cells with the ability to form cooperating groups spontaneously and to take consecutive steps sequentially even when the genetic background and environmental inputs are identical. To break the mirror in such homogeneous condition, we need two devices respectively responsible for temporal and spatial differentiation. The implementation and application of such devices will lead to bioengineering where complex programs consisted of sequential steps (structure oriented programs) and cooperating agencies (forked instances of a single class, object and event oriented) can be embedded in a single genome. Although this ""differentiation"" process resemble the development of multicellular organism, we tend to use a more bioengineering style analogy: assembly line. Or maybe after some years from now, this will not be just an analogy.

DNA Double Digestion Protocol
download PDF version
Materials:
DNA sample(s) in water or TE buffer
10x digestion buffer
Restriction enzymes (EcoRI or SpeI or XbaI or PstI)
DNA loading buffer (if electrophoresis is subsequent)
Agarose gel 1.5% (or different depending on expected band sizes)
Procedure:
1. Test the concentration of the DNA sample(s).
2. Pipet the following into a microfuge tube:
20uL reaction system     50uL reaction system
DNA around 1ug     around 2.5ug
10x Digestion buffer 2uL     5uL
1st Enzyme 1-1.5uL     2.5-4uL
2ndEnzyme 1-1.5uL     2.5-4uL
ddWater Rest of volume Rest of volume
3. Incubate at recommended temperature (37.0 degrees) for 2 or 4 hours (0.5~2hfor enzymes of NEB, 4h for enzymes of Takara).
4. Take 2 to 5 uLof the digested sample, add loading buffer, and run it on the agarose gel to check the result, or take the entire sample to run to extract a wanted fragment).
Tips:
1. DNA:
For identification of DNA, use 0.4 ug/uL DNA; (or 2uL from a nice DNA mini prep)
For cloning, 1ug/uL DNA is enough.
2. Buffer: we’d better use the buffer that comes with the enzyme, which means buffers from other company may cause some abnormal results.
3. Enzyme: the maximum volume that an enzyme can be used is 1/10 of the total reaction volume (example: 2 uL for 20 uL reaction system). If you want to do overnight digestion, add less enzyme (example: 1 uL for 20 uL reaction system). It is necessary to point that too many enzymes will reduce the efficiency of enzyme digestion with glycerol in it.
4. Gel: make sure to run the uncut DNA as a control along with the digested DNA sample(s). And, always run a DNA marker!

Safty Page
1.    Would any of your project ideas raise safety issues in terms of:
•    researcher safety,
•    public safety, or
•    environment safety?
safety measures taken during experiment
Since our project concentrates on developing a versatile and unique platform for bacterial cell-cell communication, there may beseveral safety issues relating to researchers, the public and the environment regarding the parts from pathogenic bacteria. Therefore, a laboratory regulation had been established according to national biosafety standards as well as with requirements from experienced supervisors. It is required that researchers follow strict guidelines during experiments to minimize their possible exposure to potential risks. Parts from pathogenic strains are also carefully dealt with to prevent any possible horizontal gene transfer to the environment outside. Specifically, bacterial cells are preserved in certain conditions and all the materials and instruments, wastes included, are sterilized with alcohol or bleach after experiments. In addition, our protocols are carefully designed to eliminate potential hazards to the public or to the environment.
2.    Do any of the new BioBrick parts (or devices) that you made this year raise any safety issues? If yes,
•    did you document these issues in the Registry?
•    how did you manage to handle the safety issue?
•    how could other teams learn from your experience?
No, none of our newly-made BioBrick parts would bring about any safety issues according to current professional information.  Although our system includes several genes from Vibrio cholera, Streptomyces griseus and S. coelicolor, respectively, these genes are not directly involved with virulence or antibiotic resistance in any case.
3.    Is there a local biosafety group, committee, or review board at your institution?
•    if yes, what does your local biosafety group think about your project?
•    if no, which specific biosafety rules or guidelines do you have to consider in your country?
Yes. The project is supervised by several professors and managers in laboratory. The proposals, guidelines and protocols have been carefully revised regularly to ensure biosafety control. The Office of Laboratory and Equipment of Peking University is responsible for any of our relevant safety issues. This webpage provides links of laboratory management rules and regulations generated and implemented by the office, This page specially focuses on laboratory safety issues, biosafety included.
Also, we have taken national laws, rules, policies, standards and regulations into consideration. Our laboratory strictly follows the national standard ’ Laboratories—General requirements for biosafety’(GB19489-2008) and ‘Biosafety Regulation on Pathogen Microbes’.The links are as follows:
•Laboratories—General requirements for biosafety
•Biosafety regulation on pathogen microbes
4. Do you have any other ideas how to deal with safety issues that could be useful for future iGEM competitions? How could parts, devices and systems be made even safer through biosafety engineering?
safety measures taken during experiment
Biosafety issues are not only academic topics but also ethic and public affairs. Thus, public engagement is of necessity and significance. Here we are proposing the idea of an online safety workshop in both academic and plain styles. With the workshop pages teams or any other visitors may have an easy excess toward the most essential knowledge regarding researcher safety, public safety and environment safety as well as participate in the assessment of projects.  Also, more new ideas about safety control might be collected through online forums. In addition, it is also a good idea to encourage safety issues to be discussed in human practice. In order to minimize potential hazards through engineering, special attention should be placed on horizontal gene transfer (HGT). Engineered lab strains are less likely to compete with wild type strains in field niche and consequently HGT is the more possible occurrence for public or environmental safety issues. Since safety characteristics of a system may vary with its component gene parts, orthogonality and distribution of the system and self-destruction devices within single plasmids should be encouraged. By developing biologically orthogonal platform and distributing whole system into different membrane-insulated cells, HGT of any single gene would probably not give rise to negative effects of the system working together. As for the single gene case, a suicide system integrated in the standardized backbones may help. E.g. the plasmids could encode endogenous toxins, while engineered lab strains chromosomally bear anti-toxin gene. Toxin will work once the plasmid accidentally transformed, so that the hazards of HGT would be further reduced.

The Greenfield-Central School Corporation is proud to be one of the newest additions to the iGem community as well as a pioneer into the high school division. Our team has been formed from the Biomedical Innovations class at GCHS, which is the fourth year course of the Project Lead the Way Biomedical Sciences Academy.  In this capstone course, we apply our knowledge and skills gathered throughout our high school careers to answer questions or solve problems related to the biomedical sciences. We have designed innovative solutions for the health challenges of the 21st century as we worked through progressively challenging open-ended problems, addressing topics such as clinical medicine, physiology, biomedical engineering, and public health. We had the opportunity to work on an independent project with mentors or advisors from universities, hospitals, physician’s offices, or other industries. At the end of the course, we were expected to present our work to an adult audience that may include representatives from the local business and healthcare community. This is our first year being involved in iGEM and we hope to expand our team as well as the high school division as a whole.
Who we are
HEY!!!! I need your individual pictures so as soon as you have them email them to me! :)

All work described on this wiki or on our Partsregistry pages was done by ourselves. We managed the whole project, from planing to financing and the complete lab work by ourselves. Nevertheless we could not have done all this work without the help, advice and guidance of several people. Hence, special thanks to the following people:
Our Instructor Dr. Jörn Kalinowski for giving us the opportunity to participate in iGEM through letting us work in his lab. We were provided with our own laboratory room and could use all instruments and materials of the lab. Furthermore, Jörn helped us with scientific guidance, financing, paper work and was always available for answering questions.
Prof. Dr. rer. nat. Erwin Flaschel for providing us with lab space. We were able to use all the fermentation and downstream processing equipment we needed in his Fermentation Engineering lab. Additionally, he helped us finding sponsors by mediating contacts.
Our Instructor Dr. Christian Rückert always gave great advice for our scientific problems. He helped us for example with primer design, the preparation of DNA synthesis or gave advice on our purification protocols.
Nils Lübke as a former iGEM team member helped us with his experience, listened to our endless discussions and problems during our weekly team meetings and adviced us on our public relations work.
Dominik Cholewa aided us with his knowledge considering our large-scale fermentations and various purification methods.
Maurice Telaar helped us with our fermentation and downstream processing questions.
We want to thank Prof. Dr. Alfred Pühler for promoting our work, giving us the opportunity to host a session at the CeBiTec Symposium and always answering our questions.
Nikolas Kessler as a former iGEM team member gave us guidance especially with web and graphic design.
Armin Neshat as a former iGEM team member helped us with our everyday questions and ordered all our chemicals and primers.
Frederik Walter as a former iGEM team member answered our questions as a specialist for the LC-qTOF MS/MS.
Prof. Dr. Thomas Noll helped us finding sponsors by mediating contacts.
Dr. Werner Selbitschka for inviting us to and organizing the CeBiTec symposium.
Dr. Petra Lutter and Melanie Gerken for helping us getting started with the model.
Prof. Dr. Dario Anselmetti for the analysis of our S-layer coated silicon wafer by atomic force microscopy.
Dr. Volker Walhorn for analyzing our beads under the atomic force microscope, explaining to us that beads are not that easy to handle and methods for an AFM need to be established in more than three days...
Dr. Karsten Rott and Dieter Akemeyer for performing scanning electron microscopy for our S-layers.
Carola Eck and Manuela Meyer who gave us support dealing with protein analysis by MALDI-TOF MS.
Yvonne Kutter and Eva Schulte-Berndt for giving us advice each time when there were uncertainties in the lab.
Janine Müller who introduced us to confocal laser scanning microscopy to analyse our S-layer coated beads.
Thomas Schäffer for fixing any laboratory equipment that needed fixing.
All members of the Coryne AG for sharing the lab and equipment with us as well as helping us with our everyday questions.
All members of the Fermentation Engineering AG for sharing the lab and equipment with us as well as helping us with our everyday questions.

iGEM links and other stuff
UNAM-Genomics_Mexico presents:
Hydrobium etli
for iGEM competition 2011
Project
Hydrogen. The doubtful begining, the unreachable end. Our paths, both the one drawn in the    maps of our heads and the one awaiting our fall in reality, will be written here, with blood     and sweat, for other adventurers wishing to reach the border of what our knowledge lights.
The Rhizobium etli Work Kit
Arrows, bow, rope, shield, sword. The warrior relies heavily on his tools. This is why     trustworthy tools are not necessary but vital along the travel. The blacksmith is a hero    too. Here is his story.
Model
Wizard wisdom lights all heroes paths. The seers ability to overcome trouble beffore it    presents itself saves resources and lives. Being a step ahead can make the difference.
There are many kinds of wizards. Most of them lack the beard, the hat and the magic wand.    But you must not be deluded. They can be just as powerful. They are vital for any heroic    campaign.
Yes, wizards don't know it all. But who does?
Safety and Ethics
If while saving the princess you destroy the kingdom, you're no hero.
Human Practices
Little heroes save their princess. Big heroes save towns, cities or nations. Great heroes    save the people.
Our
This is how we changed along the path:
Our logbook (or the team's tale)
Our tools, and how they grew old with us
Our memories, imprinted in minds and bytes
Ourselves (as childs, teens, men and women)
Sponsors
Thank you Puss in Boots, thank you Tinker Bell, thank you Godmother

We study the Genomic Sciences Undergraduate Program at the Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México. Synthetic Biology is bliss and we are more than eager to share our passion for science. iGem is a great opportunity to design, create, and explore within Synthetic Biology (and sometimes beyond!); which is the reason we are all here. Our team is a mosaic of people where each of us has a major area of interest. Therefore we have split ourselves in different subproject teams, never forgetting the integrative approach needed for engineering. We hope you enjoy learning about our proyect as much as we enjoy doing it.

Sung Won Lim, Genspace NYC co-founder. Aspiring mad scientist. Biolaser coming soon to an enemy near you.
Justin Fabrikant hails from the paradise of Santa Cruz, California. He studied Biology at Brown University while playing Ultimate Frisbee, his true passion. Justin is currently pursuing a Master of Architecture degree at Columbia University, but misses the rigor of science. Thus, he joined the Cooper-Columbia iGEM team in order to explore his most intimate love for the hack, Frankenstein, bizarre, and absurd world of synthetic biology.
Peter Liu is a junior at The Cooper Union majoring in Chemical Engineering with a minor in biochemical engineering. He joined the igem team this year to further his knowledge and lab skills in the field of synthetic and microbiology. In my free time I enjoy breakdancing, freerunning, and basketball.
Alison Acevedo is a junior at Cooper Union studying Interdisciplinary Engineering. She has been working on the wetlab team at Cooper Union. Alison joined iGEM because of her interest in synthetic biology and to gain experience working in fields related to biomedical engineering.
When she’s not hard at work tasting exotic foreign cuisine (Icelandic minke whale wasn’t as good as she had hoped), Rikki Frenkel studies architecture at Columbia University and coaxes bacteria to produce quantum dots at her local community biolab.  Hailing from beautiful Cedarhurst, Long Island, she has built an exciting life out of creative indecision.  Frenkel has lived in three countries while pursuing women’s studies, chemistry, architecture, and atomic force microscopy.  She has questionable eyesight and prefers the world blurry.
Matthew Piziak grew up in Queens and New Jersey and is now studying Computer Science and Mathematics at Columbia University. iGEM taught him that programming bacteria is just as interesting as programming computers.
Christina Eng is a sophomore majoring in Chemical Engineering at The Cooper Union. In addition to her engineering studies, she is also interested in the biomedical sciences and public service. She has many hobbies, which include swimming, playing tennis, and traveling to places.
Chris Lin originates from Carlisle, MA where stop lights do not exist. He continued his love for small towns at Bates College before transferring to Columbia University in an attempt to become an Electrical Engineer. He has developed a keen interest in synthetic biology after experiencing the glory of iGEM.
David Isele is a recent Cooper Union graduate who is now pursuing his PhD in Robotics at the University of Pennsylvania. He has formally studied Electrical Engineering, Oil Painting, and Perception and he thoroughly enjoyed his wondrous though sadly brief excursion into the world of Biotechnology.
Hi! My name is Mingyu Kim. I'm a Jericho High School student and one of the High School students at Genspace. I love wet lab and I love Biology! Bio-engineering is COOL!
When not plugged in, Will Long attends the Bronx High School of Science. He enjoys coding in Python, Java, and DNA. Someone should tell his teachers to give him less homework, so he can actually sleep at night.
Jason Walker is a M. Arch Candidate at GSAPP - Columbia University with a BS in Engineering Physics from Lehigh University
Ellen Jorgensen is passionate about increasing science literacy in both student and adult populations, particularly in the areas of molecular and synthetic biology. She is presently an adjunct faculty member at New York Medical College, and teaches courses and workshops in molecular and synthetic biology for the general public at Genspace. She is the leading mentor of the Columbia University-Cooper Union 2011 iGEM team.
David Orbach joined Cooper Union in the summer of 2008 with a BS in Agricultural and Biological Engineering from Cornell University and a MS in Biomedical Engineering from the University of Rochester. Before joining Cooper he also earned an MD, did an intern year, and developed an interest in improving efficiency and patient throughput in the Emergency Room setting. He teaches several biology and biomedical engineering courses, including cell and molecular biology, physiology, and microbiology; helps direct the Kanbar Center for Biomedical Engineering; and serves as the college’s pre-medical advisor. Outside of Cooper, David now helps create iPhone apps and workbooks for children. See www.Brain-go.com.
Dionne Lutz began her love of science at SUNY Purchase, earning a degree in biology with concentrations in biochemistry and biotechnology. After years of research at Albert Einstein College of Medicine, she got antsy and picked up her masters in education. Feeling philanthropic, she taught middle and high school in NYC's Department of Education. Now at The Cooper Union, Dionne is the Technician of the Maurice Kanbar Center for Biomedical Engineering. She helps students to transform their biological theory into actual laboratory experience, focusing on tissue culture and molecular biology. Upon hearing of the iGEM competition, she had only wish the program existed while she was an undergrad.
Oliver Medvedik earned his Ph.D. at Harvard Medical School, in the Biomedical and Biological Sciences program.  As part of his doctoral work he has used single-celled budding yeast as a model system to map the genetic pathways that underlie the processes of aging in more complex organisms, such as humans. Prior to arriving in Boston for his doctoral studies, he has lived most of his life in New York City.  He obtained his bachelor's degree in biology from Hunter College, City University of New York. Since graduating from Harvard, he has worked as a biotechnology consultant, taught molecular biology to numerous undergraduates at Harvard University and mentored two of Harvard’s teams for iGEM
David Benjamin is Director of the Living Architecture Lab at Columbia University’s Graduate School of Architecture, Planning and Preservation (GSAPP) and principal of the architecture firm The Living. Recent projects include Living City (a platform for buildings to talk to one another), Amphibious Architecture (a cloud of light above New York's East River that glows and blinks according to water quality and public interest in the environment), Proof (a series of design studios at Columbia that explore testing as a design methodology), and Architecture Bio-Synthesis (a collection of new software and wetware tools for design with synthetic biology). Benjamin received an M.Arch. from Columbia GSAPP, and a B.A. in Social Studies from Harvard University.

Tokyo_NoKoGen 2011 is built up of 10 students, 2 advisors, and 3 instructors. Student members through discussion with the advisors and instructors decided our project concepts. All laboratory works were only done by student members (Kotone, Shoko, Yuki, Chifuku, Saki, Masataka, Eri, Koichi, and Hikaru) in the laboratories at the Department of Biotechnology and Life Science, Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology. Our wiki was designed and constructed by ourselves(Our wiki was designed and constructed by Nasa. The contents were mainly written by Nasa, Kotone, Shoko, and Masataka. Chifuku made nice figures.). Sponsors only supported by providing laboratories to work at, experimental materials, and funding. All team members very much enjoyed doing our project and greatly appreciate Assist. Prof. Ferri, Prof. Ikebukuro, and Prof. Sode for all their supports.

Tokyo-NoKoGen 2011 official team profile
We are the Tokyo-NoKoGen 2011, a Japanese team from Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology. 10 undergraduates and 2 graduates have been joining the project in this year. All members belong to the Department of Biotechnology and Life Science of TUAT. Our team name stands for the name of our university (東京農工大学), in Japanese.
Tokyo-NoKoGen has participated in iGEM since 2009, making our broad knowlegde of biotechnology to use in synthetic biology. NoKoGen had worked on the E. coli auto protein synthesizer designated ""ESCAPES"" in 2009 and the EcoTanker in 2010. With contribusions for iGEM and synthetic biology, our teams got a bronze and a gold medal in 2009 and 2010, respectively.
In this year, Tokyo-NoKoGen 2011 produce EcoLion, the E. coli collecting heavy metal ions. The EcoLion works for bioremediation and recovery of heavy metals such as cadmium and arsenic. The EcoLion can be differenciated from other team's previous projects aiming at collecting heavy metals using E. coli. Our EcoLion transport heavy metal ions into its cell and capture the ions using metallothionein. Then the captured heavy metals are transferred into a bacterial microcompartment (BMC) and concentrated in it. BMCs are very atractive protein structures that function for localization particular small molesules and proteins, especially enzymes. The combination of a BMC and a metallothionein fused to locallization-tag peptide would make it possible to accumulate more amount of heavy metals in E. coli and concetrate the collected metals, thus you can collect much more heavy metals using the EcoLion.
In the same time of having fun for our iGEM projects, we had many discussions on the synthetic biology and biosafety. We hope our EcoLion project contribute to expand the potential of synthetic biology for the future.

iGEM Prizes
Best Human Practice Advance
This has been the first presence of Trieste in iGEM and this meant quite a hard venture in building up a team, finding money, finding a hosting lab, designing and developing our project.
We students have made it all, obviously with the support of the University of Trieste but mostly with our passion and determination.Here in Trieste, for its history and location, we found an ideal place in which young students like us could undertake this innovative approach to research that iGEM represents.
We invested a great amount of energy on human practices because we aimed at creating the right environment to make iGEM a core activity among the first steps of the future researchers.
We decided to talk about iGEM and about our experiences as iGEM team through different channels and in different ways referring to a wide range of audience.
You can find a detailed description of UNITS_TRIESTE team human practices here!

Comments
IGEM more than a competition is a life experience; it involves you at all, sometimes it is hard sometimes funny but above all it is by far the best experience which a student could done during his undergraduate studies. The UNITS_TRIESTE Team is an “Handmade” team, no advisors working in synthetic biology field, no company linked to synthetic biology business only 6 students and their mighty wish to take their place in a worldwide acknowledged competition as IGEM is.
Synbiome is made of  ""undergraduate"" thoughts  and it has been realized by ""undergraduate"" hands.
As any researchers know three months are nothing, only 90 days tu build up a new, innovative and competitive project to face the world of synthetic biology.
We decided to do it as it must be do, no shortcuts: 6 month of preliminary work making reality the wish to partecipate at igem, learning about  everything as biobricks, sponsors, registry, registration,  human practice, tracks, jamboree, team and whatever else but mostly we thought about the project, tons of rough ideas falling down as bricks (Not yet so “Bio”J), looking for the best way to handle our first partecipation. At the end of june Synbiome was birth, son of all our minds and father of all our expectation.
Thanks to Synbiome we had the chance to involve scientists originally unrelated to the field of synthetic biology as our instructors. They believed so much our project that we’re not only working at Synbiome  in a competitive optical but mostly looking forward  to reach a publication at the end of the year.
These rows have been written only to give you all the feelings that this experience has meant for us, we really hope that you will enjoy Synbiome.
Looking for Boston
During the Regional Jamboree in Amsterdam we focused our attention in collecting any kind of feedbacks from everybody: judges, instructors, advisors and other igemmers.
This has been really useful also to plan our work during this supplementary month.
Looking for Boston we decided to change the genetic circuit inside the bacterial strain A.
At the beginning of this experience we believed that forcing a strong mutualism between the two bacterial strains would represent the best way to build a stable consortium. Following this purpose we designed for Amsterdam a bacterial strain A, which in response to OXOC8 produces OXOC12 and glucosidase and a bacterial strain B, which produces OXOC8 and glucosidase in presence of OXOC12. Both A and B are not sensible to their own language and so A needs B and vice versa. This kind of circuit guarantees a strong mutualism but will also generate a kind of useless redundancy in which both A and B produce the same  reward for the whole system.
Moreover this genetic circuit needs an initial external injection of or OXOC8 or OXOC12 to start the system.
Our feelings suggested us to keep Symbiome simple and more effective associating to each characters a specific and unique task.
On these new evidences we decided to give to cell A the role of starting up the system by constitutively producing OC12, leaving to cells B and C the production of the rewards, respectively the beta-glucosidase and the secreted beta-lactamase.

COOPERATIONS
Edinburgh IGEM team
During the theoretical work on Synbiome we decided to use a β-glucosidase to provide our Interkingdom Consortium with a usable carbon source. We asked Chris French to send us the part BBa_K392008, made by team Osaka in 2010 and encoding a β-glucosidase from the bacterium Cellulomonas fimi. Firstly, we tested the part and it worked, but the DNA sequencing we decided to make during the generation of our parts BBa_K553005 and BBa_K553006 underlined the presence of a frameshift at the beginning of the coding sequence, introducing a stop codon. We shared this information with team Edinburgh and together we elaborated a solution to this strange problem (more details can be found on the cooperation page of team Edinburgh’s website). They were also very kind to provide us with a protocol of an assay that can be used to test the activity of this β-glucosidase using 4-methylumbelliferyl-β-D-glucuronide.
Beta Glucosidase
CYP Analysis
Wageningen IGEM team
We also collaborated with team Wageningen, analyzing a bacterial strain expressing CFP with Fluorescence Microscopy. During the summer they typed on Twitter looking for a Confocal Microscope with the proper laser and filter for CFP’s wavelength. Since we had it here at ICGEB, we positively replied to team Wageningen’s request and helped them analyzing their samples, as they also reported in their website’s cooperation page.

SINBIOME TEAM
OVERVIEW
iGEM team UNITS_trieste is composed by 6 students 2 advisors and 4 instructors: a small team with a great idea!!
The first meetings with the complete team started in march, however we individually started thinking of good ideas for iGEM in november 2010, so we did a hard work also before starting the actual work in the lab.
At the beginning there was only three members in the team and it seemed impossible to find all the necessary for our project, but we finally enlarged the team proper to the actual 6 members, and then together we found the teachers and researchers who helped us and critically judged our ideas for iGEM (we thought of at least at 50 ideas before finding the right one!). After a lot of meetings with different people, we found our path and we designed our project, which was approved and enthusiastically received by all our advisors with a “great idea guys!!!we can help you, let's start working!!!”.
Lots of people who are not an actual part of the team have carefully listened to our imaginative projects and helped us find the right way, giving us a great support for which we deeply thank them all!!
The current members of the team are:(Click for details on image clickable areas!)

Giulio Bernardinelli: THE PERFECT
24 years old, Functional Genomics student.
He is from Verona, and has a BSc in Medical and Pharmaceutical Biotechnology (S.Raffaele, Milano).
The perfect one, he is careful that everything is going well, takes care of who is in trouble with his work and needs a hand. He has everything in his mind and if you need to know something about the wide world of molecular biology you just have to ask him, he’ll know it for sure!!
Dont' try to decompose his orderly way of taking pipette tips out of their boxes because he won't stand it! But he does indeed do some beautiful drawings with his tips' boxes!
He is a member of the bacterial lab but, as said before, he always runs in help to the  “eukariotics” whenever they need him.
Luca Braga: THE COMMUNICATOR
23 years old, Functional Genomics student.
He is from Piacenza and obtained a BSc in Medical Biotechnologies from the University of Milan.
The communicator, he can speak with everyone. Maybe some students fear about speaking with directors of departments or of research centres... This is not his case, he always has the right word in every moment for every person! Totally hyperactive, he has the ability to speak with 3 people, prepare a PCR, write an e-mail and control 4 different gene sequences, all at the same time!!
He is a member of the eukaryotic lab, he has all the cells under his control... And they do what he wants... He has the right words for them as well!!!
Veronica Parisi: THE RED
24 years old, Functional Genomics student.
She is from Trento and got a BSc in Biology at the University of Bologna.
The red, she stands out a mile because of her hair,: now she is red but you never know how she could be tomorrow, maybe blue or yellow...
The one who remembers all the numbers of the biobricks we are using, and their position in the plates without checking the registry. Do not disturb her while she is working because you could be bitten! Indeed she is really nervous and concentrated in the lab but out of it she is more like a funny Oompa Loompa!
She is a member of bacterial lab and she loves her competent cells!
Francesca Cesaratto: THE SMALLEST
23 years old, Medical Biotecnology student.
She is from Trieste and obtained her BSc in Biotechnology at the University of Trieste.
The smallest one, hard worker and serious when it is necessary. She has a perfect  scheme of what we have done and what we will do, no step will be skipped! But she also is a little brat during relaxing cofee moments… Pay attention if you are quietly drinking your coffe because she probably will jump at you laughing and tickling your belly!
She is a member of bacterial lab and won’t let anyone skip his experimental control… She will know everything and will never be so nice with you... Until you do everything properly!!
Niels Ntamati Rwaka: THE PEACEFUL
23 years, Neuroscience student.
He is from Trieste and had his BSc in Biotechnology from the University of Trieste.
The peaceful one of the group. He never complains of his work and is never angry or nervous. When you see him in the lab he is always doing his work quietly and serenely, and he always welcomes you with a smile. Unfortunately, though, shooting the rubber band of his gloves to the people passing in the hallway of the lab has become his favourite hobby, and he has a good shot so he never misses his target.
He is a member of the eukaryotik lab, and cells are so happy when he is around them!!
Pierluigi D’Antrassi: THE INVISIBLE MAN
28 years, Clincal Engineering student.
He is from Catania and had his BSc in Informatic Engineering from the University of Catania.
You can't see him in the lab working with the other igemmers..but when you take a look to units igem website you can understand that he is working hard...alone at home!!
Indeed he is IGEM_UNITS wiki's guru!
All the igemmers miss his presence in the lab, he is a gentleman with everyone (expecially with girls), and he has a smile for everyone!He is always busy, he does at least 1000 calls per day, and he has always 1000 people to meet...but nevertheless, first, he thinks about igem website, and he is doing a great job!!!
Giulia Devescovi:
Research Assistant, Bacteriology and Plant Bacteriology group, ICGEB Trieste.
She helps the bacterial group for iGEM, without her we are lost. If you don't know how to do something or it’s nearly the tenth time you are redoing an experiment, she’ll have the right answer!!
Rudy Ippodrino:
PhD Student of Scuola Normale Superiore of Pisa. He works in the Molecular Medicine group, ICGEB Trieste.
He advises the eukaryotic group with his experience, but his best skill is throwing deadly water-filled gloves at the unsuspecting iGEM members!
Guidalberto Manfioletti:
Associate Professor, Faculty of Mathematical Physical and Natural Science, University of Trieste.
Serena Zacchigna:
Staff Research Scientist, Molecular Medicine group, ICGEB Trieste.
Vittorio Venturi:
Group Leader, Bacteriology and Plant Bacteriology group, ICGEB Trieste.
Alberto Pallavicini:
Associate Professor, Faculty of Mathematical Physical and Natural Science, University of Trieste.

Team:Panama/Team
From 2011.igem.org
Where are we from
We are from the Republic of Panama, Panama's natural history is of great importance to the American continent. 3.5 million years ago Panama emerged linking the seabed of North and South America. The migration of species allows the exchange of species from north to south, further increasing the number of plants, animals and other life forms in both continents. Because of evolutionary and geological processes, Panama has one of the richest biodiversities in the world. It is a huge laboratory ready to be responsibly used. Panama in native language means ""abundance of flowers, butterflies and fish.""

IMPACT OF iGEM
TEAM
OVERVIEW
STUDENTS
ACADEMICS
SPONSORS
Our core team was made of 9 Cambridge University undergraduates from a wide range of courses. There were 4 biologists, three engineers, one physicist and one mathematician. While every member of the group broadened their knowledge, our different areas of expertise allowed us to simultaneously approach problems from many angles.
We were also aided by a student from the Royal College of Art (RCA) who was able to provide us with a completely different perspective on our work. Her advice and creative input was invaluable to our project.
We were advised by several academics (both from within the university and externally), both professors and PhD students, who provided technical assistance and insight. They all did a fantastic job of providing positive feedback, without guiding the direction of our project.
With the team's budget especially tight this year due to the increased cost of the competition, our sponsors were invaluable - they contributed the reagents, kits and cash which enabled us to take part.
Attribution
Work carried out primarily by our advisors is clearly labelled as such. In particular we are grateful to Paul Grant for assistance operating the confocal and for his advice during our microscopy , and to Matthwe Hawkeye (or collaborator in the Nanophotonics Dept) for assisting Felix in making thin films and in measuring spectral properties of reflectin.

I finished the second year of Natural Sciences at Cambridge University and I plan to specialize in Genetics from October, being particularly interested in different methods of regulating gene expression. The iGEM experience was especially valuable for me because it allowed me to get a glimpse into the world of real science and showed how fascinating the work in the lab can be! During the project I was mainly involved in the wet work, especially enjoying sealing gel tanks, vortexing and laborious pipetting. Apart from biology, I'm interested in modern art and underground Polish music scene.

I just finished my second year engineering course, still haven't quite decided which area of engineering to specialize in. In the past one and half week, I enjoyed roaming the unfamiliar territory of synthetic biology despite the steep learning curve.

Biological Natural Sciences - I've just finished my second year of Natural Sciences here at Cambridge University. So far I have studied modules in Cell Biology, Evolution and Behaviour, Plant Physiology, Animal Physiology, Neurobiology and Developmental Biology. iGEM has so far introduced me to lots of Biology that is outside of the courses I have studied in the last couple of years and I have really enjoyed stepping outside of my comfort zone and building a working 8x8 LED matrix my first Arduino project and getting stuck into some computer programming with the Microsoft Research team. I have high hopes for our team this summer.
Haydn King

I have just finished second year Engineering at the University, and am likely to be studying Information and Computer Engineering next year. Having no biological training since GCSE, I was very interested to learn more about the subject during the course of this project. I am particularly interested in the parallels which can be drawn between computation 'in silico' and that which can be done within a living cell.
I come from a small village called Brechfa near Carmarthen in south west Wales, and am a fluent Welsh speaker.
Catriona McMurran
Cat
Soon to be a third year Biochemist, currently learning more than anyone needs to know about what a squid looks like on the inside.  Thanks to iGEM I have become mildly obsessed with the number of followers on the team's Twitter feed, and have read so much about reflectins I can pull references out of my ears.  Having studied mostly pure biology in my degree so far, I'm finding the engineering-based approach of synthetic biology really interesting.
Jonathan Very
Jonathan
I'm a Natural Scientist who's specialised in the most abstruse of all the Biological subjects: Biochemistry (I like to think of it as being like the 'particle physics' of life). My role in the group is to document the peculiar and often amusing things that go on our lab (see the blog), track down ex-iGEMers and charm them into taking our questionnaire (see the 'society' page) and occasionally put what little biological skill I've gleaned from my two years' study into some labwork. When not doing such things I can be found playing and performing Renaissance lute pieces, and writing fiction.
Katy Wei
Katy
I'm a physicist who has not encountered biology since GCSE times, and I joined iGEM fearing that I wouldn't contribute any useful knowledge to the group - to my pleasant surprise, however, the physics of optics proved extremely important in our project. IGEM was a great experience for me to get familiar with biological research, and I really enjoyed getting my hands dirty in the wetwork too. Impressively, the field seems to me even more mysterious and open-ended than current research in theoretical physics, which I was previously looking to specalise in. I now confess to being a complete convert, and am looking forward to working in biophysics in the future!

Research Format
Our research for iGEM included both a spring semester seminar and summer lab work. The spring semester portion of our research consisted of a small student-led seminar and laboratory boot-camp. The seminar experience was led by members of last year’s UVA iGEM team. We met twice weekly to discuss and analyze timely research from extensive readings drawn from scientific journals on topics germane to our changing synthetic biology focus areas. During the final few weeks of the seminar, we developed several proposals for our summer project which we presented to our advisers. In addition, two hours per week were dedicated to intensive hands-on lab instruction regarding lab safety, protocols, modeling, and methodology. Aside from background research, all work for the project was done during the summer and a few weeks spilling into the fall 2011 semester.

Human Practices - Outreach
Human practices are an important part of iGEM. Synthetic Biology and the idea of a parts registry is not well-established among the general public. It is important to inform people of the potentials, but also the risks of synthetic biology. For our human practices we decided to do several things. On one hand we were present with a talk and discussion round at the “CBB come together afternoon” to introduce iGEM to the new master students. On the other hand we were present at the Open house day of the department of Biosystems Science and Engineering (D-BSSE) of the ETHZ to bring SmoColi to the public.
7.10.11 CBB Get together afternoon
The CBB Get together afternoon is an event where students, alumni and professors of the Computational Biology and Bioinformatics ( CBB ) Master programme at ETH come together and talk about academic life. Every year several senior students and alumni present their experiences and give programme-related advice to their colleagues (primarily to first year students). On this year's CBB Get together, Lukas had the honor to talk about his studies and he highlighted the iGEM competition as one of his most memorable experiences. Among others, he talked about synthetic biology and about our project. After the event, during the ""Apero"", many first-year students approached us and started asking lots of questions. We simply couldn't resist taking out our laptops and presenting our cool simulations and our results. We had very interesting discussions with them, and we feel that we conveyed our excitement about our SmoColi. We are convinced that after our talk many of the new students are thinking about joining the team next year.
Some impressions of the CBB meeting
22.10.11 D-BSSE Open house
The cover of the flyers distributed at the entrance of the D-BSSE department on the Open House Day
The Open House day of the Department of Biosystems Science and Engineering (D-BSSE) of ETH Zurich is an event where scientists show their research to the public. During the day, all the department groups present their research through posters, pictures, computer simulations, real data etc. The event is organized with the goal to familiarize people with the work that is done in the department. The event is also a nice way for the scientists that work in a particular group of the department to get to know better what the other groups of the same department are doing. The Open House Day is also very useful for master students in a search for a master thesis and/or PhD positions. Among the visitors, there are many families with small children. The groups always find playful ways of talking about science and research to them, through games, puzzles, legos etc.
During this year's D-BSSE Open House Day, one of the stands was reserved for iGEM and our SmoColi project. We presented a Poster, showed our simulations and experimental results on a computer and even presented our microfluidics channels.We carried out a survey on the topic of Synthetic Biology. We talked to many visitors as well as to scientists of the D-BSSE department.
The science done in the department was classified in three categories: Investigation, Simulation and Design/Engineering. iGEM was classified under the third category. Read more about it at ETH Life (in German only).

Poster and Discussion
The poster that we presented during the Open House Day
During the Open House Day, we had a stand with our poster and a slideshow with some pictures of our work. A lot of people people were fascinated by our project and were asking many questions. We managed to attract a lot of audience and to promote the idea of iGEM and Synthetic Biology. Through our poster, we introduced the idea of having standard registry parts that can be used for creating synthetic circuits. We also introduced some previous iGEM projects, which we believe made people think in which areas synthetic biology can be used. Some of the people that came to us were kind to take their time and answer our survey.
Survey
We decided to do a survey to find out what the general public thinks about Synthetic Biology, what is the people's degree of knowledge regarding this field and how open they are to accepting genetically engineered machines into their daily lives.
Questions
1. Is your profession related to genetic engineering?
□ Yes □ No
2. Does anyone in your family have anything to do with genetic engineering?
□ Yes □ No
3. How would you evaluate your knowledge of Synthetic Biology on a scale from 1 to 10? (1 - no knowledge, 10 - very good knowledge)
□ 1 □ 2 □ 3 □ 4 □ 5 □ 6 □ 7 □ 8 □ 9 □ 10
4. How high would you evaluate the risks of Synthetic Biology on a scale from 1 to 10? (1 - no risk, 10 - high risk)
□ 1 □ 2 □ 3 □ 4 □ 5 □ 6 □ 7 □ 8 □ 9 □ 10
5. How much trust do you have in the scientists that do Synthetic Biology on a scale from 1 to 10? (1 - no trust at all, 10 - complete trust)
□ 1 □ 2 □ 3 □ 4 □ 5 □ 6 □ 7 □ 8 □ 9 □ 10
6. Do you think that a critical discussion for the “Synthetic Biology” issue is possible with the scientists?
□ Yes □ No □ Partly
Comment:
7. Could you imagine an implementation like SmoColi in your daily life?
□ Yes □ No
8. Do you think it is justifiable that students make genetically modified organisms for a competition like iGEM?
□ Yes □ No
9. Is the conduction of animal experiments for a competition like iGEM justifiable?
□ Yes □ No
10. Can you imagine how the genetically modified organisms could simplify your life?
Results
In order to get a better understanding of how people feel about synthetic biology, we analyzed the data that we collected during the Open House Day. A total of 34 people filled out the survey, ranging from undergraduate and graduate students, scientists to members of the general public.
Figure 1: Percentage of people whose profession is related or not to genetic engineering
Figure 2: Percentage of people who have or don't family members whose profession is related to genetic engineering
The first two questions evaluated how many of the persons who filled out the survey were themselves involved or had a family member who worked in an area related to genetic engineering. This is an important question because it allows us to see whether we have a specific bias in our survey, since we postulate that people who work with genetically modified organisms will tend to be more open to synthetic biology. The results showed that slightly more than half of the persons work in genetic engineering which is ideal for us since in this way our following results will not be biased.
Figure 3: People's knowledge of Synthetic Biology on a scale from 1 to 10 (1 - no knowledge, 10 - very good knowledge)
We were also interested in how much people know about Synthetic Biology. Our results show that although 7 is the most frequent response representing 20% of the total , the responses are widely distributed across the scale. This is again an encouraging result, because it means that we managed to capture the opinions of a wide target group.
Figure 4: People's opinion regarding the risks of Synthetic Biology on a scale from 1 to 10 (1 - no risk, 10 - high risk)
One of the most important questions was related to people's opinion about the risks of Synthetic Biology. We can notice that we obtained a Gaussian-like distribution, with the majority of the people considering that there is a moderate risk, and only a small percentage who feel that there is no risk or very high risk.
Figure 5: The amount of trust people have in the scientist that do Synthetic Biology on a scale from 1 to 10 (1 - no trust at all, 10 - complete trust)
Figure 6: Percentage of people who agree or not that a critical discussion regarding Synthetic Biology is possible with the scientists
Questions 5 and 6 assess how people feel about the scientists who work in Synthetic Biology. The results show that in general people trust the scientists and that the majority of them feel that there could be meaningful discussions on the topic. This is a positive outcome, since it tells us that overall the general public supports the development of this field and has faith in the abilities of the people who work in it.
Figure 7: Percentage of people who could or couldn't imagine an implementation like SmoColi in their daily lives
Figure 8: Question 6 analyzed only on the people whose work is related to genetic engineering
Figure 9: Question 6 analyzed only on the people whose work is not related to genetic engineering
One of the things we were most curious about is whether people think that our project could be used in reality. We are very pleased by the positive attitude of the public, 70% of them believing that SmoColi could be implemented in their daily lives. We also wanted to see whether the responses of the people whose work is related to genetic engineering is different from those whose work isn't. The results show that the persons who do not work in the field are more optimistic about the practical application of our project, with 81% responding ""yes"". On the other hand, only 61% of the people working in genetic engineering feel that SmoColi could become part of their life. We think that this more conservative attitude is due to the fact that the persons who work in this field have a better knowledge of the difficulties involved with turning a scientific idea or a novel technology into a commercial product.
Figure 10: Percentage of people who think or don't that it is justifiable that students make genetically modified organisms for a competition like iGEM
Figure 11: Percentage of people who think or don't that the conduction of animal experiments is justifiable for a competition like iGEM
Finally we were interested in the public's opinion regarding what should be allowed in student competitions. It seems that whereas the public has no problems when it comes to using genetically modified organisms, they object to the conduction of animal experiments. This is important because a few teams performed animal experiments.

Though IGEM must be quite familiar to many US students, it’s the first time for us to personally experience the whole process; it’s so worthy and is surely a new watershed and highlight of my college life. Thanks for all my iGEMers and those self-giving friends. I always insist that we should just try it again until we get what we want; I always strike for perfection however tough it is. These beliefs support me to get over all the difficulties and the unexpected. Breathe brand-new atmosphere in iGEM , let’s feel and create new vitality for Synthetic biology !   I am responsible for the whole organization of the team, designing and operation of summer experiments, mission allocation and handling all kinds of affairs and problems.   Email：no.1.liuwei@gmail.com   Research interest: neuroscience and synthetic biology
Yang Liu  Grade 2008
I am Liu Yang, student majoring biochemistry and molecular biology. I am so excited about participating in 2011 iGEM. Here, I want to give my sincere thanks to my team members of OUC_China and teachers who help us selflessly. To many iGEM teams, synthetic biology is an interesting field of biological science; but for us, it’s not just a cutting edge subject, it’s an unforgettable fantasy about dream, dignity and fighting. On the way of seeking, we are afraid of nothing!   I originally propose the idea of interpreting Theory of five elements by the bacteria. I am also responsible for external networks for our team, including ask help from sponsors, team publicity and art design.
Xiaoyan Yu  Grade 2008
Yu Xiaoyan, also named as Don Quixia, is a senior student majoring in marine biology in Ocean University of China, an explorer of freedom and natural secrets, whose interests lie in science and art，believing physics is a critical part of the key to biology's secrets.    I am responsible for information selection and experiment designing, like new biobrick searching and standardization design.
Jun Zhang Grade 2009
I'm Zhang Jun, an optimistic and enthusiastic girl.  It is my honor to take part in this synthetic biology competition. I like swimming and I'm good at singing. I like the mystique of science, in which the challenge and the sense of achievement during the experiment make me crazy. Despite setbacks, I'll never give up! I gave presentation for my team at the China meeting up in USTC, I am also responsible for many sections of the experiments, such as those about the deficient bacteria, and part of notebook making.
Xiaoxi Zhang  Grade 2009
 Hello, everyone! I'm Zhang Xiaoxi, a Chinese girl. I'm from OUC university. My major is  ecology. It's an honor to join part in this game, and I really have learned a lot. In my life, I am curious and optimistic. I want to try many unknown things to get excited, including this experience. But sometimes I will be very lazy, sitting on my bed for a whole day. I love smile, my signboard is my smiling face. Look at my! Do you want to be my friend? I am mainly responsible for searching the previous biobrick parts, drawing gene maps and doing experiments.
Qian Zhang  Grade 2009
I'm Zhang Qian. I'm very straightforward. I don't like hiding my true thoughts. I'll say and do what I think. Music and art are always a part of my life. Although I don't think I’m good at singing and drawing. I like challenging myself. It's my great honor to take part in this synthetic biology competition. Before the competition, I know little about synthetic biology. Maybe it's the first time for me to learn knowledge not in class. It’s my biggest rewarding. However it's difficult, now that I have decided to do it, I’ll never give up. I enjoy the process very much. We are fighting ~O (∩_∩) O~. I am mainly responsible for searching the previous biobrick parts, drawing gene maps and doing experiments.

Support and thanks
        The whole work of OUC-CHINA is done by 11 undergraduate students in OUC. During the process, the whole project is divided in different parts, such as design of gene loop, new biobrick  design, culture works and wiki. Not only everyone takes a part of duty, but also cooperates with others.
        Our project is supported by Qingdao Institute of Bioenergy and Bioprocess Tech Dr. XU Jian and Dr. LV Xuefeng allow us to do experiments in their lab, and help us academically. Their selfless care of us young researchers and strict science spirit really inspire us greatly. Our advisor TAN Xiaoming help us with the microbiology techniques and give advice when we encountered weird or tough problems, such as the analysis of gel result and offer reference information for us to learn. Other lab members also help us in teaching about how to use all kinds of facilities.
        College of marine life sciences in OUC also provides financial support for our registration fee. Our instructors have given us useful suggestion and academically support. Dr. YANG Guanpin works with us to design two of the whole five gene loops. Dr. SUI Zhenghong and Dr. ZHANG Xiaohua help us on microbiology.
        Besides, we are greatly appreciated: Dr. ZHANG Shicui who contributes $1,000 for our experimental fee; Dr. LIU Tao who gives us free DNA sequencing services and free PCR primers from Dr. LIU Xiaoshou. Professor WANG Xianghong and DONG Shugang also offer 1000RMB for our trip to Asia regional jamboree. Our idea is academically supported by Dr. SONG Linsheng from Institute of Oceanology, CAS.What makes us feel surprise and appreciate is 2 professors donate 1000RMB without leaving their names. Thus really let us feel encouraged, we will do our best!
        Apart from that，we must greatly thank the Zhu Jun professor, Zheng Huiming lecturer and Zheng’s graduate Ling Jun in Nangjing Agricultural University. They study the functional gene in Rhizobium, especially the genes about quorum sensing.  In our Wu Xing system, two novel quorum-sensing system in rhizobia is necessary. We learn experimental methods and get two kind of rhizobia from them.
        Finally, we want to say thanks to everyone who has shown their kindness to OUC-CHINA. We will exhaust our ability and let nobody feel disappointed!
Mutual help with other teams
        First, we want to thank Haoqian Zhang for his Enthusiastic help when we went to Peking University for experience consulting twice. Since it is the first year we took part in iGEM competition, we are unfamiliar with many affairs, his instructions help us a lot in our process.
        In return, after China Meet-up in July when we knew that Peking University were interested in our newly standardized biobricks would be useful for their project, we send three new modified strains to them, we hope that our new products will make any significance for their project.The information about the three standardized biobricks is as follows:

Who did the work on our different projects:
Primer Designer
Hannah Landes coded the primer designer scripts in python after learning it at the beginning of the summer.
BLAST Tool
Balvir Kunar completely coded the BLAST programs from beginning to end.
Genome Sequence Analysis
While we arranged the delivery of our experimental Deinococcus strains, Russell Durrett prepared the sequencing libraries for them.
Russell also taught us how to analyze the coding sequences of the new genomes by going through the pipeline on the existing sequences. He helped us write the run_pipe.sh shell script to generate the data files, and then Sun won Lim generated the visualizations. The Mason Lab typically works with Human genomic data, so this project is substantially different from the research currently going on there.

Hi I'm Steph and am currently in the first year of my PhD.  I have heard many strange and wondrous things about synthetic biology and the iGEM competition.  So I have  decided to come along and see it for myself.  It has not disappointed!  I love being part of this team and finding out just how much you can bend biology to your will....

Where we're from
We all study at the University of Glasgow in Scotland's largest city.
The University was founded in 1451, and apart from being generally amazing it is most notable for its gorgeous neo-gothic main building designed by Sir George Gilbert Scott. With its spire and quadrangles it is enough to make anyone feel like a student of Witchcraft and Wizardry.
The University was based in Glasgow Cathedral until 1460. It then moved to Glasgow High Street, where it operated for the next 400 years. When the University outgrew its facilities there it relocated to Gillmorehill, to its new, specially built campus. The campus, where over 23,000 students attend, currently comprises of 104 buildings. The University library holds over 2.5 million books on 12 floors, making it one of the largest libraries in Europe.
Glasgow itself is a great city with a vibrant nightlife and a broad range of more cultural activities to choose from. Many museums are free for anyone and always worth a look. For Example, the Kelvingrove Museum offers a slightly random collection of natural history and art, and is also architecturally very interesting. Additionally it is a great place for anybody who would like to learn more about the history of Glasgow.

Hi, I'm Christine. I had my first taste of iGEM in 2007 when I was on the University of Glasgow team and helped design an environmental biosensor called ElectrEcoBlu. Now that I have started my PhD I am back for more. I'm looking forward to seeing the products of this year's team's fantastic DisColi project.

Stirling castle.
I am undergraduate student at the University of Glasgow reading MCB. I joined the iGEM team to find out more about the exciting emerging field of synthetic biology. I actually live in a town in an area of Scotland called the Hillfoots near the historic city of Stirling, site of the famous battle of Bannockburn.

Hi, I'm Michal. I came from Poland to study in Glasgow. I have a broad spectrum of interests: from snowboarding, through sailing to martial arts. Not forgetting about molecular biology, of course. I've just finished second year of Molecular and Cellular Biology at University of Glasgow. I'm very excited with our project and working as a part of iGEM Team. I have a feeling it's going to be a great summer!

Our team has accomplished all the project design, experiments and modeling by ourselves.
Advisors Lin HE and Gang MA offered us valuable advice and information.
Professor Peter G. Schultz from the Scripps Research Institute, Professor Andrew D. Ellington from the University of Texas at Austin and Professor David A. Tirrell from Caltech are so kind to send us the plasmids that we once needed. Though later we adopted our own design and didn't use the plasmids, we still thank these professors for their kind and timely help.
Professor Jianhua LIU from Shanghai Jiao Tong University offered us a lot of useful advice and technical support, we owe our thankfulness to him.
We also would like to thank our host lab for offering us the equipment and consumptive materials needed to perform experiments.
At last, we would like to thank Merck Millipore for their sponsorship. Besides, the advice from Dr. Volker Hilarius and Dr. Shou Wong have inspired us a lot.
We also would like to thank our second sponsor GenScript.

2011 SJTU-BioX-Shanghai is composed of nine students and two advisors that come from SJTU and this is the third time for our school to participate in iGEM.
fig 1. 2011 SJTU Bio-X Shanghai iGEM Team logo
Our understanding to synthetic biology grows with every paper we read, every lecture we attend and every idea we proposed. Start with passion, we come together because of a common dream to design something cool, something brand-new and something that is applicable. We are also attracted to the broad and promising future of synthetic biology, hoping that this competition can be our debut in making contributions to human health, energy resources, research and any other field with synthetic biological methods.
There are innumerable brilliant ideas in the brain storming. There are fierce discussions in the lab meeting. There are obstacles in experiments. There are busy bodies working into midnight. We laugh, we enjoy. We argue, we improve. One thing that never changes is our trust to each other. We are teammates, we are friends, we are family.Another thing that will not change is our confidence in our project and our dream. That is what keeps us moving forward without fear.
Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU)
fig 2.SJTU
An imperial edict issued in 1896 by Emperor Guangxu, established Nanyang Public School in Shanghai. The normal school, school of foreign studies, middle school and a high school were established. Sheng Xuanhuai, the person responsible for proposing the idea to the emperor, became the first president and is regarded as the founder of the university.
Since the reform and opening up policy in China, SJTU has taken the lead in management reform of institutions for higher education, regaining its vigor and vitality with an unprecedented momentum of growth. SJTU includes five beautiful campuses, Xuhui, Minhang, Luwan Qibao, and Fahua, taking up an area of about 3,225,833 m2. A number of disciplines have been advancing towards the top echelon internationally, and a batch of burgeoning branches of learning have taken an important position domestically.
Today SJTU has 31 schools (departments), 63 undergraduate programs, 250 masters-degree programs, 203 Ph.D. programs, 28 post-doctorate programs, and 11 state key laboratories and national engineering research centers.
SJTU boasts a large number of famous scientists and professors, including 33 academics of the Academy of Sciences and Academy of Engineering, 92 accredited professors and chair professors of the ""Cheung Kong Scholars Program"" and more than 1,900 professors and associate professors.
After more than a century of operation, Jiao Tong University has inherited the old tradition of ""high starting points, solid foundation, strict requirements and extensive practice."" Students from SJTU have won top prizes in various competitions, including ACM International Collegiate Programming Contest, International Mathematical Contest in Modeling and Electronics Design Contests.  More than 200 of the academics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and Chinese Academy of Engineering are alumni of Jiao Tong University.
Bio-X Institutes
The Bio-X Institutes of Shanghai Jiao Tong University was formed in 2005 by merging the Neuropsychiatric and Human Genetics Group (NHGG), which was established in 1996, and the Bio-X Life Science Research Center, which was established in April 2000.
The founding of the Bio-X Institutes represents a landmark in interdisciplinary research among the life sciences. The mission of the Institutes is to provide not only an interdisciplinary institute, but also to serve as a forum for discussion among scientists and students from a variety of disciplines and fields.
fig 3.Bio-X Institutes
The current director of the Institutes is Prof. Lin He, a fellow of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and the honorary director is Prof. Steve Zhu, physics Nobel Laureate. The Institutes consist of a number of ""core"" and ""satellite"" groups lead by dozens of distinguished scientists and specially appointed professors from China and abroad, as well as many highly-talented post-graduates and research fellows from various academic backgrounds all being supported by a team of administrative professionals and research technicians.
The research at the Bio-X Institutes focuses on interdisciplinary topics between nutrition, health& disease, development and reproduction, biosaftey and DNA computing. More in detail, we currently have research programs in genome mapping and cloning, functional genomics, pharmacogenomics, proteomics, psychiatric metabolism, DNA computing, bioinformatics and nation-wide protection of genetic resources.

He first came to Dundee in 1992 to undertake a PhD in bacterial genetics and energy metabolism, before leaving Scotland altogether and moving to Norwich, England. Frank returned to Dundee in 2007 as a Professor in the College of Life Sciences. He knows a bit about E. coli physiology, basic molecular biology, and protein chemistry. Hopefully this will come in handy. Frank also has the important job of raising sponsorship for the team and somehow getting everyone to two international jamborees.
Natasha Christodoulides
I’m a 4th year Biomedical Sciences student with a passion for public health. I’d like to work towards bridging the gap between science and clinical medicine. What initially caught my attention when we were told about the iGEM competition was the prospect of turning ideas into reality from scratch. The opportunity to use my imagination, think outside the box while still building upon my scientific knowledge and skills.
Emelie Johansson
I am a 3rd year Biomedical Science student. A lot of my dedication at university has been directed towards Neurobiology and Pharmacology. However, synthetic biology is a fascinating and relatively new field which is providing me with a unique perspective on science. On my free time I like to rock climb, play golf, read, sing, travel or just hang out with friends.
Lucia Licandro Lado
I was born in Belgium, but have lived most of my life in Spain and Italy. I developed a love for science during high school, and specially for microbiology, because I love the idea of being able to modify microorganisms for our advantage. I also like to read and write short stories.
Rachel Montague
I am about to start my fourth and final year of Applied Computing at the University of Dundee. I have always had an active interest in technology and love keeping up-to-date with new and current technologies. A lot of my time at University is spent developing software solutions for clients as well as responding to briefs set by lecturers. At the moment I am developing applications and games for smart phones and hope to have them available for download very soon. In my spare time I also like attending festivals and hanging out with friends.
Brian Ortmann
I have just finished my final year of BSc(Hons) in Biomedical Sciences and I am delighted to be graduating with a first class honours. My next step is to further my knowledge through a PhD. My research interests lie in the fields of diabetes and cancer. I look forward to studying the new exciting field of synthetic biology and I believe the practical experience gained through our iGEM project will greatly aid me in pursuit of my PhD. I also like the interdisciplinary element of the project allowing me to take part in a lab work but also the computing and mathematical model building. Outside of the lab I enjoy playing tennis and also reading.
Lionel Dupuy
Lionel Dupuy is Research Leader at the James Hutton Institute. He has expertise in computational biology with track record in root system architecture visualisation, image analysis and modelling. His research has made important contributions to the understanding of root system development and interaction with the environment. He has developed various methods for imaging and modelling plant development.
Ciarán Kelly
Hi I'm Ciarán and I'm delighted to be an advisor to the Dundee iGEM team 2011! I'm originally from Dublin, Ireland, but came to Scotland in 2002 for my undergraduate degree at the University of Glasgow. I've just gone into the 2nd year of my PhD in Frank Sargent's lab (MMB) and my project is to try and engineer a ""superstrain"" of E. coli producing lots of biohydrogen! I love my sport and apart from my borderline obsession with football, I like to do a bit of running, tennis, golf and basically any other sport going!
Rachelle Binny
I am about to start my 4th and final year of Mathematical Biology at the University of Dundee. When people ask me what I study, my response nearly always triggers questioning looks, raised eyebrows and comments such as maths and biology?...what an unusual combination!. In actual fact, mathematics has many applications in biology, for example in population dynamics or mathematical modelling of cellular processes. I am particularly interested in the modelling and simulation of tumour growth and its applications in cancer research. Getting involved in the rapidly evolving new field of synthetic biology is going to be a challenging but immensely rewarding experience and I'm very excited to be a part of the interdisciplinary Dundee team for iGEM 2011. When I'm not scribbling down equations, I enjoy climbing, hill-walking, skiing and other outdoorsy activities!
Dave Gibson
I am an Applied Computing student going into my final year. My interests lie mainly in web application development and learning new languages/skills so coming into this project with minimal biology knowledge has been a fun learning experience. Outside of University, I love to play guitar and my dream is to move to somewhere cold and mountainous like British Columbia, Canada.
Kasia Kozyrska
I have just finished my final year of a BSc(Hons) in Molecular Genetics and hope to graduate spectacularly this June. I spent most of my two last years of university wreaking havoc in various research labs, where I discovered that my love for budding yeast goes far beyond my simple fondness of beer. Manipulating yeast uses similar techniques to those used for bacteria, so my mad wet-lab skills should come in useful on our quest for iGEM Champions 2011. That being said, I will not tolerate unwashed DNA gel tanks or mistreatment of lab equipment and all culprits will be punished by poking with a pipette tip.
Jane MacCallum
I am a Molecular genetics student coming to terms with the fact I am entering my final year of university. I am interested in anything to do with cells and molecules but also enjoy the microbiology portions of my degree so bring on the bacteria! I love the interdisciplinary element of this project so can’t wait to get started as synthetic biology is a new and exciting area for me. Outside of science I love to cook, play tennis and watch my beloved Dundee United..
Richard Owen
Richard is a 3rd year biochemistry student, with interests in how science can be used to approach the global problems we face in a responsible and sustainable manner. I think that synthetic biology is a very interesting expanding field that has potential to address some of these problems, such as climate change and resource shortages. Outside of study I like to spend time with friends, cycling, camping or working on the university allotment.

Thanks also to the Division of Molecular Microbiology for the use of equipment and space. We gratefully acknowledge The Wellcome Trust Rotation Studentship Program for providing molecular biology equipment. We thank all our sponsors for the consumables used in this work. Student stipends over the summer were awarded by The Wellcome Trust (nine studentships), the University of Dundee (one studentship), and the James Hutton Institute (one studentship). Travel funds were provided by the Scottish Universities Life Sciences Alliance (SULSA), the Society for Applied Microbiology (SfAM), the College of Life Sciences, University of Dundee, and the School of Mathematics, University of Dundee.
T-shirt design was the work of Dyce Davidson while cakes and biscuits were baked by random team members.
Contributions
None of the advisors or instructors are involved in microcompartment research - the project areas were chosen entirely by the team. All cloning and sequencing was carried out by Rachelle, Natasha, Kasia, Lucy, Richard, Brian, Jane and Emelie - overseen, in addition, by Prof Tracy Palmer and Dr Sarah Coulthurst. Our molecular biology ""training week"" was supervised by Tracy, and we have since never ""strayed from the path"". Protein production and Western analysis was all done by the team. Confocal and electron microscopy was kindly supervised by Dr. Alan Prescott. Website design was down to Rachel. The iPhone apps were also done by Rachel, while the Android apps were designed by Dave. In addition, Ciaran and Dave conceived the Gene Synthesis tool and Dave made it a reality. The DNA analysis tool was also the work of Dave. Mathematical modelling was figured out by Rachelle, and we thank Lionel for his enthusiasm for iGEM and his modelling workshop afternoon.

Team
The Imperial iGEM 2011 team consists of a group of biochemists, biologists and bioengineers. On this page, you can find out about everyone who has contributed to the project. We would like to thank all our advisors who have assisted us throughout the project, and without whom the project would not have been possible. We would also like to thank all everyone else who has helped us realise this project, be it through invaluable advice or providing DNA, seeds, or other materials. These contributions have helped us enormously. All work on this wiki was carried out and all data collected by us unless stated otherwise. For a full list of acknowledgments, please see the bottom of this page.
Students
Atipat Patharagulpong
Atipat is also known as Ming (people sometimes call him ATP, which he finds a bit geeky). He is a third year biochemist and responsible for collaboration, part registry, and Arabidopsis (and also drawing everyone's picture). Apart from Biochemistry, he loves playing the piano, drawing anime, gardening, and also cooking (and eating too).
Chris Schoene
Chris is going into his 3rd year of Biochemistry at Imperial College London and is our official head of parts characterisation. He has been interested in Synthetic Biology since the last year's team presented their project in October. His other interests include creative writing, martial arts, the classical guitar and travelling. He is German but was born in Colombia and has lived in the USA and Spain.
Frank Machin
Frank is halfway through his degree in Biochemistry at Imperial and responsible for the software and hardware. He has been a huge fan of Synthetic Biology ever since he watched ""The Andromeda Strain"" and ""The Day of the Triffids"". When he is not working, he likes gaming, loud music, and making short films and he is going to try and include them all in this project!
Jiayue Zhu
Jiayue, or Nina, is a 2nd year bioengineer and does a lot of the modelling work as well as the design of our poster. She is best known for being an unflinching reservoir of calm and playing with her phone in all situations, except, possibly, her death.
Nicolas Kral
Nick has just finished the second year of the BSc Biology degree at Imperial. He has been attracted to Synthetic Biology because of the immense potential and creativity that is hidden in it, while still following the strict scientific thinking. His hobbies include everything to do with Nature and the great outdoors, hiking, climbing, caving and just the joy of being out.
Nikki Kapp
Nikki just finished her undergraduate studies in Biochemistry. She is our team leader and is glad to use the knowledge she has obtained from her course into practice in the iGEM competition. Her duties in the iGEM team include cloning & assembly strategies and outreach/PR. Nikki's life isn't all about science, she is passionate about music and travel and would like to have a taste of different cultures by completing an around-the-world trip.
Rebekka Bauer
Rebekka just finished a degree in Biology. She has taken the role of human practice coordinator and has done mostly plant biology in the lab with some super cool imaging. She likes the creativity of Synthetic Biology as well as its potential application in solving world problems. Outside of science, she is interested in photography, travelling and cooking some tasty food.
Si Chen
Si just graduated with a degree in Biomedical Engineering. She joined the Imperial iGEM team with the intention of delivering a solid solution that can be applied to reality in the future. She is one of our modelling whizzes and can do scarily impressive things on Matlab. She is also the most fashionable person on the team.
Yuanwei Li
Yuanwei just finished the 2nd year of his Biomedical Engineering degree. He is our wiki mastermind. He probably wants to specialise in the mechanical aspect of bioengineering, dealing with things like biomechanics. He is also quite interested in going into the area of biomedical imaging. In his free time, he likes to play his accordion and he loves to travel to different places and explore the world. He is looking forward to delivering something amazing in this iGEM project.

Outreach
The 2011 ArtScienceBangalore is a team of 12, Core Skills (2nd year) Art & Design students from Srishti School of Art, Design and Technology, Bangalore. Yashas Shetty, the team facilitator, and Aaron Joseph the team advisor, led the team through the project and research along with the help of Alisha Panjwani, Zack Denfeld & Cathrine Kramer . Special thanks to the scientists at National Centre of Biological Sciences (NCBS) – Mukund Thattai, Ashwin Seshasayee and Navneet Rai for helping us out with the experiments and lab work.
Get to know us!:
Achala Athreya
After joining an art school, Achala never imagined herself ever taking part in a science based competition. The recurring field in the second year of her college life inculcated future design inklings. Her interests however, lean towards textiles, photography and theatre.  She enjoys tennis and lately is a maniac about yoga.
Akshaya Maria Thomas
Easily recognizable with her wild curly hair, Akshaya is a keen learner and a photographer at heart. She likes experimenting with new methods and techniques. Stationary makes her happy. She enjoys baking and playing chess. She detests clowns and things that crawl.
Anvita Goenka
Anvita never had interest in biology or any kind of science from her school days and decided to try something different and that is how she landed up in Art Science Bangalore. Apart from working on this project, her interests are mythology, catching up with new trends of fashion, experimenting with looks and clothes, food and wildlife.
Biswajith Manimaran
When you say “Bisu”, his obsession with video games, his laptop, and green shirts are a few things that springs to one’s mind. He’s the “go-to” person for explaining the huge scientific terms that most commoners shy away from, and for explaining most technological terms. He’s quite naturally the resident geek of Art Science Bangalore.
Damyanti Choudhary
After the joyful moment of passing her science exam for the first time, Damyanti hasn’t looked back at science as a subject since her 10th grade. Through her years since then, her interests developed in interior design, which also led her to join art school. But now, she contemplates the thoughts of pursuing product design, which also became one of her major interests. She’s loud and very short tempered, but has got the perfect skill for organization and research.
Durga Gawde
Born and raised in an art environment, Durga always knew what her calling was. Science always intrigued her. Although, she hated the way science was taught in the school level her love for science never left her. Igem helped her see new methods of learning, understanding and application. Apart from working on this project, her interests are sports (mainly speed skating), experimenting with photography, listening to powerful music, conversing with different types of people and working out.
Madhul Singh
Madhul spends her time playing computer games and stumbling on StumbleUpon. An avid reader, she has a special fascination for mythology and wildlife. She hopes to pursue both at some point. She also has a fascination for adventure, and climbs a rock-face like a goat, though coming down is a whole different ballgame (she has Vertigo!). She's the first person you go to when you're troubled and the last person you'd want trouble with. Beware!
Manasa Thimmiya
Manasa loves music, and travel. Her love for new things and her passion for communication design are what pushed her to do iGem. She is notorious for her brilliant graphics, her interest in social service, and her laziness.
Prakrithy Pradeep
Prakrithy loves to read (everything and anything, except self-help books - they are just plain ""Blah"") and makes biryani (a preparation of a one-pot meal with rice and meat, laced with exotic spices) to die for. She spends her free time indulging in writing and photography. She dislikes cockroaches and people eating her chocolate, and indulges in using her (always-carry-with-you) Post-Its for anything and everything.
Pranav Raman Since he was 2(make that 5) Pranav has always been interested in science and its applications. Being an art student he has channelized his attempts at finding a harmonious combination of both science and design. It has always fascinated him how if put together, they can do amazing things. Looking at science through an artist’s point of view has opened up a whole new world to him. He also has a keen interest music, singing, playing the tabla and flute.
Sidharta Guha Thakurta
The “free spirited” one of the team, Sidartha is a born artist who is into expressionist sculpting and painting.  He’s enigmatic and has a wild sense of humour and culinary preferences.
Sohil Bhatia
Famous as “safety pin boy” and for his wild and crazy ideas-when it comes to his sense of dressing and lifestyle, Sohil brings the crazy side out in Art Science Bangalore.  His work ethic and dedication to any project is influenced by his idol- Lady Gaga. His interests include drama, photography and product design.

Contributions
The project workload can be separated amongst its main elements:
Wetlab:
Design of the project: all of the students partook in the choice of the  subject; the wetlab team designed the project guided by the instructor and  advisors.
Experiments: they were done by the wetlab team (Sébastien Gérard,  François Delvin, Fanny Franchini, Thibaut Hallaert, Fanny Philippart,  Esther Brihaye, Arnaud Selvais) with some help from the modelling team (Maxime  Lucas, Pierre Corvilain, Mitia Duerinckx, François Thilmany, Jonathan  Frish). The host lab contributed with the work area and the advisors and  instructor gave technical advice.
Data analyses: this was done by the wetlab team.
Modelling:
The modelling was done by the modelling team with inputs from the wetlab team  for the biological relevance of the model and some data.
Human Practice:
Virginie Jacobs, Morgane Préat, Mathieu Peiffer were responsible of the  human practice part of the project; they interacted with the wetlab team to  define the societal problems that could be relevant to the project.
Wiki:
The wiki was the work of Sébastien Gérard, Maxime Lucas  and Pierre Corvilain. The professional website designer Thomas Huret helped them for the ""Team"" page.

Damien Geeraerts
Damien is trying to write his PhD thesis, when he is not answering our many  questions or giving us technical pointers. He is working on toxin-antitoxin  systems; specifically he is trying to find new such systems in a variety of  bacteria. He got pulled in as advisor since he is the yeast guy of the lab;  since then his writing output dropped dramatically thanks to the iGEM.

      We are not the first iGEM team in Wuhan university, but the first iGEM team to participate the competition. The former iGEM team of Wuhan university was started by Shijie Zou in November 2009.Most members come from the College of Life Science and one student from the College of Math. Despite our endearvour to understand the principles of synthesis biology, we did not not convince our college to support us to compete in iGEM. Missing the 2010 iGEM, we did not give up. In April 4th 2010, we established our new team with student from College of Life Science and College of Math. Furthermore we recruit new members from the College of Computer and Software. Together with those new peers.......
      We are not the first iGEM team in Wuhan university, but the first iGEM team to participate the competition. In our team, there are 20 intelligent and dilligent students, two experienced instructors. We cooperate with each other and be sure to get success in the IGEM 2011. WHU-China is the best team .......
     Wuhan University (WHU)is a comprehensive and key national university directly under the administration of the Ministry of Education. It is also one of the ""211 Project"" and ""985 Project""universities with full support in the construction and development from the central and local government of China.      The history of Wuhan University can be traced back to Ziqiang Institute, which was founded in 1893 by Zhang Zhidong, the then governor of Hubei Province and Hunan Province in the late Qing Dynasty. In the process of development and evolution, the institute changed its name several times before it was finally named Wuhan National University in 1928.......

Together with those new peers, we began to study the previous projects in iGEM history as well as research papers in synthetic biology. After 4 months brainstorm we successfully came up with four projects and two of them passed the oral presentation in our college. In March 24, 2011, we established our team in the iGEM competition with instructors: Dean Jianbo Wang, Professor Zhixiong Xie. Professor Xiufen Zou and team leaders: Chao Zhang, Jing You. We began our pre-experiments from March 29th.     In April and May, we establised our first iGEM experiment platform. In July till now we worked on our project using biobricks and other biological parts. We have spent a busy summer full of happiness and joy.

Introduction for WHU
     Wuhan University (WHU)is a comprehensive and key national university directly under the administration of the Ministry of Education. It is also one of the ""211 Project"" and ""985 Project""universities with full support in the construction and development from the central and local government of China.      The history of Wuhan University can be traced back to Ziqiang Institute, which was founded in 1893 by Zhang Zhidong, the then governor of Hubei Province and Hunan Province in the late Qing Dynasty. In the process of development and evolution, the institute changed its name several times before it was finally named Wuhan National University in 1928. It is one of the earliest comprehensive national universities in modern China. By the end of 1946, the university had established 6 colleges, the colleges of liberal art, law, sciences, engineering, agriculture and medicine. In 2000, an amalgamation of the former Wuhan University, Wuhan University of Hydraulic and Electric Engineering, Wuhan Technical University of Surveying and Mapping, and Hubei Medical University was announced, which ushered in a new era in its 100-odd years of development.      For the past century, Wuhan University has built an elegant palatial architectural complex of primitive simplicity which blends perfectly the eastern architectural style with that of the west. It is honored as the ""Most Beautiful University in China."" Furthermore, Wuhan University's centennial humanistic accumulation boils down to its succinct motto, that is, ""Improve Oneself, Promote Perseverance, Seek Truth and Make Innovations.""      Since its establishment, Wuhan University has cultivated more than 300 thousand professional talents in various occupations, among whom there are over 100 members of the Chinese Academy of Science and the Chinese Academy of Engineering. They have made great contribution to the national construction and social advancement. The remarkable achievements of Wuhan University have won itself an extensive international reputation. In 1999, the world renowned journal Science listed Wuhan University as one of the most prominent institutions of higher education in China.      Burgeoning are the international exchanges and cooperation of Wuhan University in recent years. It has established cooperative relationship with more than 300 universities and research institutes in over 40 countries and regions. Now Wuhan University is endeavoring to shape itself into a world-class comprehensive research university domestically and internationally.

Team:WHU-China/Acknowledgement
From 2011.igem.org
   WHU_iGEM team is the first time to participate the iGEM competition. Our project is about light sensing systems. But our college does little research on this filed. Luckily, we got a lot help from our instructors and other iGEM teams. Here we would like to give our sincere thanks to all of you. Thank you very much and wish you iGEM teams get good results.
Instructors
During this summer, our two instructors gave us a lot of help. They did not help us do experiments. But without their good suggestions, good instructions and also the laboratory's supporting, we could not carry out our projects.
iGEM_11 Team-Edinburgh
They sent us materials of green light sensing and reporting parts. List: 1. lac promoter plus repaired phycobilin synthesis operon(ho1 + pcyA), in pSB1C3. 2. green light sensor, with and without lac promoter, in pSB1C3. 3. PhoA promoter with lacZ'alpha and mCherry reporter genes, in pSB1C3. 4. CcaRS DNA, sent by Mexico - it appears that this is a PCR product, not a plasmid.
iGEM_11 Team-HUST-China
They gave us the BBa_I15010, as ours was identified as void-vector.
iGEM_11 Team-UNAM-Genomics_Mexico
They sent us materials of blue light sensing and reporting parts. List: 1. part BBa_K360123 in plasmid pSB1c3. 2. part BBa_K360129 in plasmid pSB3k3. 3. part BBa_K360129 in plasmid J61002 (or J61003). 4. part BBa_K360129 in plasmid pSB1c3. 5. The TrpR(-) E.coli strain.
iGEM_11 Team-UANL_Mty-Mexico
They sent us materials of green and red light sensing and reporting parts. List: Plasimds: pJT106, pJT116, pJT118, pJTPCB, pJT106b, pJTCph8, pJT122. E.coli strains: 1. JT2-pJT106,pCph8. 2. JT2-pJT106,pJT122. 3. JT2-pJT122. 4. JT2-pJT122,pPLPCB(S)
Our Help to Other iGEM Team
iGEM_11 Team-XMU-China
This summer we have made good relationship with iGEM Team XMU_China. We sent them backbone plasmid with chloramphenicol resistance gene and bacteria with it. These helped them to build the new biobricks and also other experiments. Details: https://2011.igem.org/Team:XMU-China/Human_Practice Furthermore, we have got some help from iGEM Team XMU_China. They gave us many useful suggestions.

Lazy excuse of a doctoral student who spends all his time reading any research paper except those about the topic
he’s ought to study. Quite knowledgeable about entomology, marine biology and world mythology, can read hieroglyphics.
Still a worthless researcher because he’s supposed to do microbiology work. Special skills
include using his rubber gloves as a sling to shoot.
Eppendorf tubes with remarkable accuracy and reading while walking on difficult terrain (our faculty is
on top of a hill and surrounded by a forest for some reason, there's a lot of difficult terrain here.)

It is Burcu from Bilkent University, Institute of Material Science and Nanotechnology. I am very proud of being a
member of Bilkent UNAM Turkey team because I think; here we reflect the real team spirit. Here is a brief
information about me: I spent every minute of me by listening music! Nothing makes me happy like talking with
people. I do love sports activities if I can bring down my laziness. Reading books is not for me but reading
articles has become my pleasure for a long time. As many members of my team, it is my first IGEM participation.
I hope we will rock the IGEM world with our endless energy and success!

The picture you look represents me. And that is all.
By the way, I like playing computer games such as DotA , TF2 and AoE2 and also -while playing-
I love characterizing other players. In order to do so, I may sometimes change, replace or insert some DNA into computer games,
I mean the source code. Some calls this cheating, but I swear it is not.

I am Tarkan and one of the member of the Bilkent – UNAM – Turkey team. I love watching and playing sports especially
football and basketball just as usual Turkish guys do. I love dancing but generally too shy to start
doing it in public. I like talking and meeting new people. Telling jokes and amusing people is my style of
communication, because that is the best way of telling your good intentions towards others. I participate
volunteering action a lot in the campus which target poor, rural and disabled children. I love them
and enjoy spending time with. So, that is it for me now.

Team Uppsala Sweden
were the first iGEM team to take up the idea for the SynBioOath and spread it via their wiki > https://2011.igem.org/Team:Uppsala-Sweden/HumanPractice/Oath .
Attributions
Each team must clearly attribute work done by the team on this page.  They must distinguish work done by the team from work done by others, including the host labs, advisors, instructors, graduate students, and postgraduate masters students.
Thus we declare that the planning and organization of an iGEM Team in Freiburg 2011 was done solely by us students. Furthermore,  the complete setup and installation of the lab, the wiki,  all the ideas for all areas of our project and all labwork  was exclusively done by the members of the iGEM Team Freiburg.
Sven Fischer
a short time team member who left us at an early state of the iGEM Project. Thanks to him, we could use the 3D protein prediction from DNA sequence web-tool I-TASSER http://zhanglab.ccmb.med.umich.edu/I-TASSER/ with which we did the rational modelling for the Precipitator protein.
ATG:biosynthetics
The company sponsored us the synthesis of the Precipitator protein and additionally a sequence optimization, to adjust the codon usage in a way that there is just the right polymerase concentration on the RNA.
Tobias Knust
soldering of the LED Box for light induction of the light sensitive promotors.
Mathias Möhl
Came into our lab with his movie equipment and shot all the scenes with us. He also did all the clipping and the animations afterwards. Thanks a lot. The result is brilliant.
DIYbio community
the fundamental ideas for the Synbio Oath were developed by the community of DIYbiologists who met at the London conference in May 2011. We frequently contacted the community for feedback on our approach.
Contributions
Team iGEM-UANL_Mty-Mexico
we had the first conversation with Mexico about the light receptor idea and after we couldn't amplify the red light receptor from the registry they send us the Jeff Tabor Plasmid pJT122. Jeff Tabor also provided us information about the plasmid. Thanks for that!
Edinburgh (iGEM Team 2010)
as the blue light sensing system was not in the distribution kit, we contacted Dr. Christopher French from University of Edinburgh to help us and send the following parts:
BBa_K360121
RBS + LovTAP Photosensor + terminator
BBa_K322999
Blue light sensor (lovTAP) + Reporter system
plus a Trp promotor with mCherry reporter gene (all parts in pSB1C3)
ΔEnvZ strain from Paris

Johannes Kaiser
Is a: Ph.D. in Biochemistry and the Manager of BIOSS
iGEM team role: Main supporter for funds and equipment
Tobias Knust
Is a: Ph.D. in Microbiology/Biochemistry
iGEM team role: Instructor of a team that does not need a instructor (ok, very little).
Is proud of: what the team has achieved.
Likes: my famlily, microbes and proteins
Philosophy: Anything is possible, with a little help from a friend.
Catch phrase: ""Nein!"" (aka ""D'OH"")
After finishing my Ph.D. thesis I joined the team as an instructor just before we began the lab work. We needed to settle in and build up the equipment in the empty lab. Since many things were missing at the beginning (e.g. PCR tubes), we could spent many hours discussing and improving the project.
I am lucky that I could join such a dedicated team of students being able to apply my skills in biochemistry, microbiology and bioinformatics and thereby helping the students in improving theirs. I never thought I could improve my skills so much while also having so much fun.
Hemin Faraidun
Is a: M.Sc in Molecular Biotechnology, PhD student studying molecular immunology
iGEM team role: Instructor
Is proud of: Having the oppertunity to learn from the team
Likes: Reading, watching movies and strangely Calligraphy
Philosophy: Simplicity is in the heart of every complex system, lets simplify
Catch phrase:
I knew about iGEM from enthusiastic students, the challenge and willing to do some thing new and scientifically attractive is not just an eye opening experience, but also encouraging to build up ideas and putting ideas in to action.
Manuel Hiß
Is a: Biologist (as written on my diploma)
iGEM team role: instructor
Is proud of:
Likes: Terry Pratchett, Katzenjammer, Hiking
Philosophy:
Catch phrase:
After attending the iGEM 2009 as a student I couldn't resist when I heard that the 2011 team from Freiburg was looking for an instructor. It's really great to see everything from the instructors side and I like the way the team has grown together.
Students
Rüdiger Trojok
Studies: Molecular and Cellular Biology
iGEM team role: Team founder; works on the Precipitator
Is proud of: genetical engineering
Likes: Travelling and Biology
Philosophy: is something people should think of more often
Catch phrase:
Synthetic Bio is the future technology.
It is our responsibility to make something good come out of it.
Rüdiger is the one who basically built up this years iGEM team. He had to talk to half of the biology faculty trying to organize a place where the project could take place. The years before Dr. Christian Müller was the leader of the iGEM teams of Freiburg and everything was performed in his lab, but after he moved to Potsdam, the iGEM team of Freiburg had to find a new place, a new suppervisor and so on. His motivation was contagious and he has a talent for keeping the overview thus being able to give instructions to people.The team wrote this description for him because he was too busy at the time modelling the precipitator.
Theodhor Tiko
Studies: Genetics, Bioinformatics, Immunology
iGEM team role: Provided assistance with founding the team; Works on establishing the lysis cassette; Always learning something from everyone on the team...
Is proud of: Being youthful at heart, hard-working and determined
Likes: Science, cycling and adventure... :P
Philosophy: Alexis Zorbas: Life is trouble. Only death is not. To be alive is to undo your belt and *look* for trouble.
Catch phrase: /Enter first goofy laugh sound that comes to mind.... \:D/
Rüdiger came up with the idea to found an igem team for the 2011 competition in September 2010 during our immunology course. It soon became clear that without the support from the old organizing lab, it would be a daunting task. So we (especially Rüdi) managed to obtain financing, a lab at the Max Planck Institute, equip it and then find the other members who would have enough motivation reserves for 6 months of nerve-racking, almost self-dependent lab work. Judging from the results, we were pretty successfull :)
Learning how to single-handedly organize a lab and keep it going, as well as simultaneously sharpening our teamwork skills and, most importantly, having a lot of fun has proved to be one the most important lessons during my studies.
Julia Müller
Studies:Biology
iGEM team role: master of 3a-assembly , always there to help,
contact-person for sponsors
Is proud of:being part of the team
Likes: sunshine, being on the racing bike
Philosophy: biology is not predictable
Catch phrase:Catch me if you can.
I have always been fascinated by Biology and have been curious about how living organisms function.
This was why I chose to study Biology.
Now, participating in the iGEM competition, we are given the chance to get to hands with these function by introducing
new features into living systems such as receptors for green and red light, which Jakob and I worked on over the summer.
I was a member of the team right from the start (since April we have been meeting up regularly)
and could therefore contribute to the organisation of the project. In the process of the build-up I was responsible for extra funding and managed to attract all the sponsors that you can see in the disclaimer below who helped us finance this project.
My speciality and important contribution to the project was the successful cloning into the linerazied pSB1T3-
vector, which is why I call myself the 3A-assembly master. It was not an easy task because of the many times
the results showed an unsuccessful cloning. Nevertheless we all tried again and again until we were rewarded with a successful result.
I can only agree with my team mates: working on this project over the whole summer, I have learned so much about
Synthetic Biology as well as organisation and the importance and all the benefits of team work! Great experience!
Sandra Wassner
Studies: biology
iGEM team role: blue light receptor
Is proud of: my Bachelor thesis, to be a member of iGEM
Likes: reading books, travelling
Philosophy: changes will only happen if we do the opposite of things we are used to
I study biology in Freiburg and I just finished my bachelor thesis when I heard that the iGEM team of Freiburg was looking for another team member. I was really happy to join them and support the team in the lab and with the wiki page. It is a really good opportunity for undergraduate students to improve their lab skills, their teamwork and also learn how to organize everything. With the autonomous work in the lab you get a lot more self-confident and self-consistent.
Sophie Cramer
Studies: Biology
iGEM team role: plastic binding domain; blue light receptor
Is proud of: I have done iGEM and my Bachelor thesis at once without my advisor noticing it
Likes: travelling, biking, cello music, experiments that work out
Philosophy: have fun at work
Catch phrase:
When I first heard about iGEM in my 4th semester, I was sold on the idea of being able to create my own little living machines, which would do something useful. So I did my best to find out how I could join the next year's iGEM team, which was not so easy because Rüdiger did not want the team to be flooded by Bachelor students like me ;). Nevertheless I finally convinced him and the others and worked as much as I could for iGEM while finishing my thesis. Now as the Bachelor's programme is completed, I will either stay in Freiburg and take a Master's degree in applied biology or go to Basel/Switzerland to complete a postgraduate course there.
Josef Csernalabics
Studies: Philosophy and Book-Sciences
iGEM team role: Human practices guy
Is proud of: An ability to keep cool if surrounded by panic
Likes: Books of all kinds, music with a tendency towards distorted guitars and coffee.
Philosophy: Yes, it already says so under 'Studies'
Catch phrase: [Expletive deleted]
I had learned about iGEM from Rüdiger in '09 and quickly got to following the developments with interest - i had been astonished of what students were attempting in their projects; so it is not really surprising that i was in right away when asked whether i'd lend a hand as part of this year's philosophy department for team Freiburg. It have been quite a few four-hour train rides by now, long hours in the lab, a lot of headaches over biological contexts i'd never heard of before but wanted to understand and the phrasing of the SynBioOath.... all worth it.
Jakob Käppler
Studies: Biology
iGEM team role: Is responsible for the green and red light receptors.
Is proud of: The things I learned since I joined the team.
Likes: The conversations and the work with this team in and outside of the lab.
Philosophy: One must imagine Sisyphus happy.
Catch phrase:
I just finished my 3rd year of the BSc degree in Freiburg and change now to the ESBS Strasbourg. The first time I heard about Synthetic biology and iGEM, was during my first year on the University. I decided to be part of an iGEM team at some day. So last February I took in hand and ask Ruediger... and lucky me... Sadly I couldnt stay in Freiburg so I just was able to work in the lab till the end of August, but nevertheless it was a great time and valuable experience I don't want to miss out.
Ilinca Tudose
Studies: Bioinformatics and System Biology
iGEM team role: some wiki assistance & occasional photographer
Is proud of: being a fast learner
Likes: the sea, silence, rains, animals, travelling, reading, making people feel happy and being good at something.
Philosophy: You are who you are when no one is looking
Catch phrase: I think
I first studied Computer Science in Romania and now I am almost finished with my master in Bioinformatics and System Biology in Freiburg. I joined the team in april as the computer scientist of the group and was supposed to do the Wiki and the mathematical modelling. I had to leave them by the end of July, due to a cool internship opportunity, so unfortunately that didn't leave us any time for the modelling part, nor enough for the Wiki. Even so, I am still grateful for the chance I was given to work with such dedicated and nice people.

Who We Are
Amanda Chang
""A watched gel never runs""
Mary Brown
Mary is a senior in Molecular and Cellular Biology and this year’s iGEM secretary.   She enjoys cloning cell cultures and using the microcentrifuge because as she says, ""It’s like a very small, deadly merry go round for E. coli.""  She likes to eat hard boiled eggs and read long Russian novels.  This is her first year on the team, having joined for world peace.
Amanda Chang
Amanda is the Operations Director for this year's iGEM team. She joined iGEM because she wanted to learn how to conduct research in a laboratory environment and have the opportunity to work with other undergraduates with similar interests. She loves how iGEM gives students the chance to apply their knowledge and skills as biologists in the lab while learning how to engineer biological systems at the same time. She is fascinated with how so many different fields and disciplines have come together to form the field of SynBio, and being a student at the University of Illinois constantly reminds her how important interdisciplinary collaboration is!
In her free time, she enjoys going on adventures, playing guitar, snowboarding, surfing Reddit, and learning guitar and ukulele. She also likes to read about transhumanism, which has only somewhat contributed to her slight obsession with cyborgs. She loves XKCD and Dinosaur Comics. She thinks writing about herself in the third person is strange.
Angela Chen
Angela is a second year student majoring in Biological Engineering. This is her first year in iGEM and also as a publicity director. She joined iGEM because she thought artificial gene circuits were pretty awesome and researching with undergrads would be a great opportunity to learn.
Throughout the year, in addition to the research activities in the wet lab, she learned the most from coordinating events to enhance community awareness of synthetic biology and general biology issues.
Besides iGEM, she travels and does all kinds of volunteer work.
David Chen
David is a senior in Molecular and Cellular Biology and is the webmaster for this year's iGEM team. He joined iGEM when a friend of him told his about how it was a completely different lab experience from any other one on campus. ""It's the only lab on campus that is undergrad run."" That grabbed his attention and off he went to join the team. He learned more than he was in store for, including how to deal with the wiki format. What a ride that was.
Throughout his year as a member of the team, he learned to appreciate the difficulty of planning ahead for the unknown, and learning to troubleshoot when the unexpected happened. He has gained a new appreciation for synthetic biology and is looking forward to seeing the work of all the other iGEM teams.
In his free time, he enjoys running through town, paintballing, snowboarding, and drinking some nice peach tea. I can tell you weren't expecting that one.
William Jones
Will is our 2011 Science/Research Director.  This is his Senior year as a Biochemistry student here at UIUC and his first experience on iGEM.  He was drawn to iGEM by the enthusiasm he noticed from past members and the dedication they showed.
Along with class work, he is pursuing a senior thesis, and shepherding cultures for iGEM. He enjoys running, eating PB and Js, and taking awesome naps (which he finds particularly enjoyable when performed in that order).  He plans to pursue a career in Medicine.
Madhav Khanna
Senior in Electrical Engineering. I love reading, riding bikes and hiking. I joined IGEM because I thought it would be fun and a great learning process.
Katie Murzyn
Katie is a junior in Bioengineering and this year’s iGEM Corporate Chair. This is her first year on the team, and she joined because she was intrigued by the stories about iGEM she heard from past members. She really enjoyed spending time with such spunky lab partners these past couple of months and has loved all of her experiences with iGEM. When she is not doing schoolwork, she loves to swim, watch horror movies, go dancing with friends, and read.
Jaimie Pepping
Jaimie is a Junior majoring in Agricultural and Biological Engineering with a Bioengineering minor at UIUC. For her, being a part of iGEM has been such a privilege as she feels constantly surrounded by motivated, intellectual individuals who have similar interests in this realm of science. Although this is her first year in iGEM, she has learned so much and has grown more confident in her dreams to become a biological engineer. While setting iGEM and school aside, she enjoys practicing yoga and meditation, cooking, painting, and traveling. She is also mildly obsessed with fruit and granola. And that is all :) She would like to thank you iGEM for this awesome opportunity!
Jinyu Sun
Jinyu is a senior student who is majoring in MCB. This year is his first experience with iGEM. He says it provides him with the perfect chance to challenge himself and to do a real science project in a modern lab. (He still can't believe we worked ""with"" Carl Woese for half a year).
He was a member of basketball team in high school. He used to play a lot until a big dude broke his arm. He started learning to play the piano when he was 5 and obtained the Chinese National Piano Grading Test level 7 certificate, but rarely plays since he is determined to get straight As in college . Guess what is his favorite activity now? Yes, iGEM!
Joseph Weber
Joe is a Junior in Molecular and Cellular and Biology and this is his first year on the UIUC iGEM team.  He joined iGEM to gain valuable lab experience and to be a part of some cutting edge science!  He has really enjoyed his experience on the UIUC iGEM, so much that he may actually get some sick satisfaction out of getting a whiff of the 37˚C grow room, not to mention a full plate of successful transformants.  Outside of iGEM he enjoys running, hiking, and skiing.

Collaboration - Cell Viability in Tailings Pond Water
We were asked by the Calgary iGEM team to to test the viability of their chassis to survive in tailings pond water. If E. coli DH5α cells containing one of their constructs can grow normally in medium prepared with tailings water, we can be confident that the chassis can be applied to tailings pond water in general.
Materials and Methods
50 mL of LB medium was made with tailings water and filtered through MILLEX filter Unit GS MF-Millipore MCE Membrane 0.22 µm in order to sterilize it and appropriate antibiotics were added. The tailings LB was inoculated with E. coli DH5α cells containing BBa_K331009 to an OD600 of 0.1. The flask was incubated at 37˚C with shaking for 7 hours, during which photometric readings were taken every 30. Photometric readings were taken using the Pharmacia Biotech Ultrospec 3000, as the OD600 readings reached 1.0 the solutions was diluted with LB media to keep the OD600 reading between 0.1 and 1.0. The same protocol was used to observe cell growth of E. coli DH5α cells containing BBa_K331009 in 50 mL of LB medium made with MilliQ H2O.
Results
Figure 1. OD600 of E. coli DH5α cells containing BBa_K331009 cultured in LB medium made with tailings water (red) and LB medium made with MilliQ H2O (black).  Performed by our team.
Figure 2. OD600 of E. coli DH5α cells containing BBa_K331009 cultured in LB medium made with tailings water (red and blue) and LB medium made with MilliQ H2O (black).  Performed independently by the Calgary 2011 Team.
Conclusion
As seen in Figure 1, E. coli DH5α cells were able to grow in LB medium made with tailings water, suggesting that the chassis will survive for use in tailings pond water.

Isaac Ward
I am from Edmonton though grew up in the small town of Vermilion.  There I never would have thought this would be the path I would eventually end up on, but one thing lead to another and here I am.  I am taking my Bachelors of Science in Neuroscience, and find it a very exciting field, with a great cross application to Synthetic biology.  I enjoy camping and hiking in the mountains, I love skiing both downhill and cross country, and have coached youth cross country ski in past years.  I had heard about iGEM prior to arriving at the U of L, and was very eager to get involved.  It has been an extreamly interesting year and I have learned so much.
Ben Vuong
I was born and raised in Lethbridge for the whole span of my life. I have just finished up my first year and will be entering my second year at the University of Lethbridge majoring in Biochemistry. This is my first year with iGEM, and I am looking forward to the knowledge to be gained from the members of the team. I plan on pursuing the career of a Veterinarian after finishing up my undergraduate degree at the University of Lethbridge. Badminton is one of my favourite activities to do. I enjoy listening to contemporary R&B music as well Hip-Hop such as Ne-Yo, Chris Brown, Claude Kelly, Frankie J and Lupe Fiasco.
Anthony Vuong
Anthony Vuong, that is my full name. I am brother to the one with the same surname (Ben). Majoring in Biology; the University of Lethbridge I am attending. This will be my fourth year—oh my, so near the ending. Also, this is my second year iGEMing. A single beer is all it takes for a crimson glow to grace my face. A common problem, they do say, for the people of my race. For me, it is a bother, though not one for my younger brother. Is it ironic that “Red” is my favourite colour? Some may say I have a unique sense of fashion. Though shy I once was, not one for social interaction. But now, others shout “Eccentric” whilst smirking at my actions. A lion’s head, I may embellish in a dance of which I do so relish—a musical exhibition originating from the Chinese tradition (Chinese Lion Dance).
Justin Vigar
I'm Justin. I think biology is way more fun when looking at it though the eyes of an engineer, so synthetic biology is a perfect fit for me. I am very excited to be working full-time for the Lethbridge iGEM team for the second year in a row. When not in the lab I downhill/freeride mountain bike, ride motocross, play guitar, and enjoy walks on the beach in San Francisco.
Dustin Smith
Hi! I'm Dustin. I was born and raised in Lethbridge and I am a third year biochem student. This is my first year in iGEM and it has been a fascinating experience thus far. The U of L iGEM team is a great group to work with and I'm happy to be a part of it. Outside of school my favorite activities are snowboarding, golfing or hanging out with friends.
Ryan Pederson
My name is pronounced identically to Peterson; the first syllable is not pronounced the same as in peddle, or pedestrian. Get it wrong and you will force me to get you a cask of Amontillado or possibly an orangutan. I have always been correctly known as a science guy among my friends, just as Prospero was known to throw killer parties, and so when iGEM came tapping at my door I graciously jumped on that beating floor board. Since then, everything seems to be going well, my house has not collapsed and all of my four cats still have both their eyes. I am a fan of Edgar Allen Poe, and, as such, I have placed nine references to different works of Poe in this paragraph. This is my first year in iGEM and I am going into my fourth year of neuroscience.

Terrance Myers
Dominic Mudiayi
I was born in the D.R.Congo and I am currently in my fourth year at the University of Lethbridge, majoring in biology. This is my second year in iGEM and I am looking forward to the fun and insightful times with the team this year. When not doing biochemistry research in lab, I can be found playing sports(track and field, soccer, rugby, cricket, hockey..etc) running or reading a good book.
Boris Lam
In north Lethbridgedelphia born and raised, at the uni is where I spend most of my days. I will be entering my third year majoring in biology, and my first year as a member of the iGEM team at the University of Lethbridge. In the future, my goal is to become a pediatric hematologist/oncologist and to own a killer car collection. In my free time, I like to play sports (mostly hockey) or playing video games, especially shooters, on my Xbox 360.
Fun Fact: According to Google, I am a yo-yo master and the winner of the 2002 France Yo-Yo championship.
Katherine Gzyl
Hi I’m Katherine, and I am in my fourth year of biochemistry at the U of L. In my free time, when I have any, I enjoy snowboarding and the outdoors. I got involved with iGEM last year, because synthetic biology fascinated me. I find anything to do with science interesting, and iGEM was a great way to get into research. This year I have stayed on the team because we have a very interesting project and a team composed of some awesome people.
Dipankar Goyal
Having moved numerous times in my lifetime, I finally ended up in Lethbridge for my undergraduate degree (Bachelors in Neuroscience). I have always been interested in pursuing a career in medicine, especially the doctors without border program. Designing medicines is highly related to synthetic biology, thus my interest in the emerging field of synthetic biology was inevitable. Outside of the science world, I live my life playing soccer, curling and cricket.
Jenna Friedt
Hello! I am a recent graduate from the U of L, earning my B.Sc. in Biochemistry this past spring. For as long as I can remember, science has been a keen interest of mine, and iGEM seemed like the perfect opportunity to explore the many different aspects involved in scientific research and innovation. In my spare time, I enjoy knitting, reading, and doing crossword puzzles (and despite what you may think, I’m not an old lady). Cheesy romance movies and bad science films can keep me entertained for hours, as well as enjoying a sparkling cold beverage on the patio with good friends, while the sun sets in the background.
Sutherland Dube
Hi I’m Sutherland (yes, that is my first name) and I am currently a 4th year student at the U of L majoring in Neuroscience. This is my first year on the iGEM team and so far it has been great! Being a neuroscience major, iGEM has been awesome at providing the opportunity to participate in research outside of my field of study. When I’m not in the lab (either neuroscience or iGEM), I love playing soccer and reading.
Nathan Dawson
Hello! I’m Nathan a student at the University of Lethbridge, currently entering my second year of Neuroscience. One thing I’ve long known about myself is that I love the sciences, so when I found an opportunity to volunteer in a biochemistry lab this spring I took it without hesitation. Through the volunteer experience I gained a wealth of knowledge (something I’m always hungry for), and a desire to continue exploring the opportunities at the university, for more learning experiences. Being on the University of Lethbridge’s iGEM team has been a gateway to the exciting world of synthetic biology. When I’m not in one of the labs (Ute Kothe’s, or iGEM), I enjoy reading, biking, scuba diving, snowboarding, and volunteering with St. John Ambulance.
Morgan Cumming
Originally from Calgary, AB I came to Lethbridge to pursue a lifelong career in academia. I figure it's the best way to avoid having to start real life. This being my first year in iGEM, I am really enjoying the learning curve and the new experiences. I cannot wait for more workshops and conferences to meet new people. When I've finally got some time off I enjoy getting outside, away from distractions, with great views and good friends. Or playing with my stereo (and you thought vinyl was dead.)
Mackenzie Coatham
Hi iGEMers! My name is Mackenzie and I’m a fourth year biochemistry major who is competing in iGEM for a THIRD time!  I’ve been involved in scientific research since high school and still love every minute of studying proteins in translation or exploring what synthetic biology has to offer.  When I’m not in a lab coat holding a pipette, I can often be found dancing or watching my fair share of So You Think You Can Dance!
Lisza Bruder
Hello!!  My name is Lisza and I have just completed my BSc in biochemistry and this will be my third year involved with iGEM.  I love being involved with research and academia which means that iGEM is perfect for me.  iGEM gives me another area of research to explore that is outside of my usual field of biochemistry.  One of the best things about iGEM is being able to help other students learn and watch them grow over the season.
Harland Brandon
I am a fourth year Biochemistry student and second year iGEM team member at the University of Lethbridge. Currently I am enjoying doing research not just with iGEM but in a research lab as well. I enjoy most things from science, to writing, to enjoying a good beer upon occasion. This year I am really looking forward to contributing to the synthetic biology community and our iGEM team. Aside from this rather bland biography of myself here is another version which should be able to put a smile on your face cortesy of my wildly wacky imagination:
It has long since been thought that the Harland was only a beast of myth, one which was said to a close relative to the tooth fairy but instead steals left over food from fridges and unguarded chip bowls. He is a beast with short blond hair and a height nearing that of a small llama. If provoked he will be easily startled and will release his bowels in order to disgust a potential threat. Not much is known about this magnificant creature aside from its high metabolism. Scientists have expressed interest in studying the Harland's digestive system in hopes of curing diabetes, although it is not known why scientists believe this creature holds the key to solving diabetes.
Advisors
Adam Smith
This is my second year as a member of the University of Lethbridge's iGEM team, and I am very excited to be back. I am taking a step back from my role last year as a lab technician, and am acting as an advisor on laboratory activities.
I am currently working as a research assistant in the molecular biology/biochemistry labs of Dr. L. Brent Selinger and Dr. Steven Mosimann, and hope that my knowledge and experience will influence this year's iGEM team positively.
In my spare time, I enjoy golfing or skiing, depending on the season, or playing Angry Birds in any season.
Fan Mo
Fan currently works as a lab technician in the Wieden lab. In her spare time she likes to play badminton, computer games and dancing in the rain. She currently holds the title for best score playing gold miner among the Wieden lab. This is her third year in iGEM as a supervisor and looks forward to another year on the team.
Jeffrey Fischer
Currently, I'm in the process of finishing my PhD in Biomolecular Science in HJ Wieden's lab. This is my third year in iGEM, and I'm delighted to be back and working with the team yet again. I am extremely busy in the lab as always, and in November, I will become a Papa! This year promises to be the best that the U of L iGEM has had yet.
Supervisors
Hans-Joachim Wieden
Originally from Germany I moved to Canada in 2005 to start a research group on the structure and function of the bacterial protein synthesis machinery, a cellular process targeted by over 50% of the known antibiotics. I am intrigued by the molecular design and function of this essential bio-nanomachine. I try to unravel the underlying design principles in order to enable the rational design and engineering of novel bio-nanomachines. I am essentially asking the question if such novel bio-machines can be constructed from simple and fundamental principles or are these assemblies just to complex. Well and that’s why it was extremely easy to rope me into doing iGEM.
A. William Smith
Smith has a BS chem, BFA movement, BA mathematics, BM music theory and composition, MFA interdisciplinary, and PhD History of Theatre, History of Art. He started the New Media Department at the U of L teaching the first class in 1999. He loves getting out of his comfort zone [and encouraging others to get out of theirs].

Team:KAIST-Korea/Team/Members
From 2011.igem.org
Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) was established in 1971 as the nation’s first graduate school specializing in science and engineering education and research. KAIST was founded under a special law with government funding and initially staffed with a number of Korean engineering and science faculty educated in the United States. Research emphasis from the outset has been put on both theoretical and applied studies. KAIST continues to be Korea’s foremost center for mid- to long-term strategic R&D projects with national and international significance.
The Chunghi & Byiung Jun (BJ) Park KAIST Institute Building (KI Building) was established for researchers to secure physical proximity to be able to exchange ideas and opinions and cooperate in research activities by a generous contribution from Dr. Byiung Jun (BJ) Park and Mrs. Chunghi Park, and Korean government. The KI Building has 21,120 square meters of total floor space with five floors above ground and one underground. The exterior will symbolize KAIST's vision and challenging spirit, and, at the same time, a flexibility and openness will be emphasized in the design of the interior. The building is located in a place that is easily accessible for researchers of all disciplines including biotechnology, IT, nanotechnology, and eco-technology. It is also ideally situated not only for our students and faculty, but also visitors from outside, because the KAIST Institutes will have a lot of external contacts for the exhibition of research results, information sharing, and intercultural activities. The KI building embodies KAIST's commitment to presenting a new model of creative and interdisciplinary research and to becoming a globally-competitive research-oriented university.

Team: Attribution and Contributions
METU-BIN is an interdisciplinary research team whose main focus is on the intersection of Systems Biology approaches and Synthetic Biology applications. For this aim METU-BIN team is composed of 12 students and 2 advisors from different disciplines such as Biology, Molecular Biology, Electronics, Computer Science, Mathematics, Statistics and Bioinformatics.
Students
Gökçe OĞUZ
Hi, I’m Gökçe :) I graduated  with a degree in Biology and currently I’m taking lectures to start the Bioinformatics graduate program at Middle East Technical University. After learning there is a huge unknown world of Syntehic Biology, I became more curious about synthetic Biology.  This is my first year in iGEM.  When I heard igem, I directly jumped into because this is a great opportunity for me to get knowledge about Synthetic biology, meet new people and have fun at the same time :) In this team, as a biologist, I am the bridge in between the partsregistry and software team.  I am working on  a database which contains bilateral relations between biobricks in Partsregistry.
Burcu YALDIZ
Hi, I'm Burcu. I'm a mathematician and I am taking scientific preparation courses for Graduate Program of Bioinformatics at Middle East Technical University. I like biology more than mathematics and bioinformatics give me a chance to use my mathematician skills in biology. This is my first year in iGEM. When I heard that two teams from METU got medals in iGEM 2010 I thought that “I must be in these teams” and now I'm a member of METU-BIN. I think Synthetic Biology is an extreme subject and it's an exciting experience for me being a part of this team. In the team I am responsible for editorial issues and organizing the sponsorship application.
İsmail ASLANER
I have just graduated from Hacettepe University Electrical and Electronics Engineering department and a fresh new student at METU Bioinformatics Msc. Program. I also have Moleculer Biology background which is the real motivation for me in this project. I would like to work more on systems biology and i believe that working on modelling and data analysis in this project is a good start for me.
Ogün ADEBALİ
Hello! I am Ogün Adebali, a fresh graduate from the 'Molecular Biology & Genetics' department of METU. Currently I am a PhD student in the program called 'Genome Science and Technology' in University of Tennessee. My mission in this team is to support our synthetic biology approach by representing it on various platforms. We organized synthetic biology round table in HIBIT2011 and participated in 'Teknovasyon' competition with our synthetic biology project. As a geneticist, I believe that it is good to be here to keep up with the developments of synthetic biology, which is one of the up-and-coming fields in my interest.
Saygın KARAASLAN
Hi there, I am a senior in Biology Department at METU and about to launch my own scientific animation company focusing on developing a Virtual Lab application. After graduation I would like to continue my studies on medical informatics, and 3D molecular animations. I was a part of the design and mutimedia group of METU-BIN and have produced METU-BIN's introductory video for BBC, logos, animation for M4B and designed the team-wear.
Ebru ŞAHİN
Hi, I’m Ebru. My major is Statistics and Computer Sciences. I’m studying Master of Science in Bioinformatics program in Middle East Technical University. I got really excited when I heard iGEM, synthetic biology and the idea of constructing artificial biological systems. This is the first time participating to iGEM and I’m on the editorial board.
Gökhan ERSOY
Hi, I am Gökhan. :) I am a Computer Engineer. And this year, I will start studying the scientific preperation class in Bioinformatics Department of Middle East Technical University, as a graduate student. This is my first year in genetics science and iGEM. Although I'm a computer scientist; I always like genetics and working in the lab environment. I think iGEM is a perfect way to improve my knowledge on genetics. In our team, I am responsible of software development. I've coded search and scoring algorithms. And I've developed GUI with the assistance of Güngör. And i've added some extra tables to the database created by Seyedsasan. Other than software development, I've helped on finding sponsorships and talked about our project in a seminar with Gökçe, for human practice. And finally with my friends, I made an interview for live news on TV. That's all. :) I would like to thank my teachers, advisors and friends for their hardwork. Good luck for all teams! :)

Güngör BUDAK
Hi, I'm Güngör. I'm one of the undergraduate students in the iGEM team METU-BIN and studying Biology major at Middle East Technical University (METU). So I'm learning the great science, Biology but at the same time, my deep interest in computer sciences takes me to that area as well. When I was taking some advice on Bioinformatics, which is the application of computer science and information technology to the field of biology and medicine, by Assoc. Prof. Yeşim AYDIN SON, she told me about the competition and the field synthetic biology. After a quick search on the Internet, I found this area amazing, and eventually I was one of the member of the METU-BIN. In the team, my contributions were to get the relational data of bioparts in PartsRegistry and store it in a standard way for computer engineers to use it. Then, I coded and designed the wiki page using HTML and CSS, and also I designed the team logo and logo of M4B. At the same time, I provided the content of wiki, with the help of my friends Burcu, Gökçe, Gökhan.

Advisors
Seyedsasan HASHEMIKHABIR
My name is Sasan. I'm studying Master of Science in computer engineering program in Middle East Technical University and participated in this team as an Advisor. I designed all the algorithms and the database in the team and also deployed the database on MySQL. In addition, I tried to motivate the rest of the team members as much as I can and to be like a chain for connecting biology subteam and our team developer, Gokhan.
Yener TUNCEL
I am a graduate of METU Molecular Biology and Genetics Program and currently studying towards my M.Sc. degree on Bioinformatics at METU. This is my second year in the iGEM competition and I am one of the advisors of the METU-BIN Software team. Synthetic biology is very promising and attractive field. Although it is a new scientific field, it holds so many opportunities for biotechnology as well as human health. My major mission is to organize and manage the team. I have also contributed to Human Practice issue for iGEM by joining innovative project competitions and scientific platforms in order to disseminate and introduce Synthetic Biology concept in Turkey.
I am very deeply interested in systems biology and its applications in the sub-fields of Molecular Biology  because I believe the holistic approach is required in all aspects of molecular biology and serves as the key factor for the understanding of entire cell behaviour, its overall mechanism and its dynamics.

Olga Pinzón Rodríguez
Olguita Pinzón
Olga is a Physics student at the Universidad de los Andes who wants to work in Cosmology and Nuclear Astrophysics. She got involved with Synthetic Biology through an advanced physics course, and she liked it so much that she decided to join this amaizing iGem team. Although Olga didn't know anything about how to work in a Microbiology Laboratory, she has learned pretty much and she spends some of her free time in the lab.
Thanks to iGem, Olga has known some friends and bacteria, but she's not very good at making jokes!
Gabriel Martínez-Gálvez
The Joy of Clowning Around
Gabriel is last year microbiology undergraduate student with a minor in physics and half way through a double major in biomedical engineering. He is also a gamer to the bone, and a heavy soccer and basketball fan. Since high school he found it fascinating and exciting to think about programming cells into living bio-robots automated to perform specific actions inside the human body. For that matter he found in systems biology and synthetic biology his main motivations for his studies and graduation thesis with the Biophysics Lab at the Universidad de los Andes .
He is very interested in the design of new biological processes through synthetic biology, dendritic cell information integration towards specific immune response coordination in humans as well as molecular psychology for a better understanding of emotions and aging phenomena.
Feel free to follow him on twitter or challenge him in PSN (PSN ID: ksk_89)!
Óscar Ortega
O^3
Oscar is a Physics student at the Universidad de los Andes, he likes biophysics and synthetic biology. He joined the Colombia iGEM team as a opportunity to learn a lot of things about molecular biology and synthetic biology. Through this experience he has known new friends and has learnt about teamwork.
Laura Marcela Guzmán Rincón
Laura always gets perfect grades
Laura is an undergraduate student in Mathematics at the Universidad de los Andes . She is a Bachelor in Physics graduated from the same university, and the main area of work is the Information Theory and Theoretical Physics. She finds in IGEM a good opportunity to explore the multiple connections between physics, mathematicas and biology. She also loves computer programming, arts, music and is very happy to know the amazing world of Synthetic Biology.
David Alejandro García Grisales
Deivid Alejandrou Garzcia Grisalues
is pursuing a degree in physics and mathematics as a member of the University of the Andes` class of 2014. David decided to participate in iGEM because he felt it would be an excellent opportunity to understand and manipulate the brick of the life to solve a big spectrum of problems. Outside the lab, David spends his free time playing the piano, reading some philosophy and literature, swimming. David also participates in a wide variety of academic activities such as in the “problem clinic” where he helps other students to solve difficulties in the resolution of problems in physics and being a prefect in a class of nanotechnology. After graduation, he wants to pursue a PhD in theoretical physics or nanotechnology. Check my video profile Here!
David Andrés Ayala-Usma
Red Bull gives you Wings!
David is a senior of Biology and junior of Microbiology that, one day, simply was in the right place to get involved with Synthetic Biology and became part of the team. He likes Molecular cell biology, Geosciences, Astronomy and some other science stuff. Also, he loves reading all kinds of tales and stories for children (like him), eating desserts, looking at the sky, taking pictures, playing at the PC, sleeping a lot, and talking, and talking, and talking... xD
He expects to eventually become a Ph.D. in Cell Biology, Earth Sciences or both, just to go around there talking about his favorite molecules, discovering new exciting things and earning money for that.
He also likes to be in contact with people around the world, and invites people with his same interests to add him on Twitter .
Roberto Carlos Lenis
Lenis
Roberto is a 19 years old, undergraduate student in Biology and Microbiology at the Andes University. He is fascinated by the regulation systems implied in cellular biology, especially with epigenetic processes and the post-transcriptional regulation systems as the RNA Induced Silencing Complex. Now that he is involved with Synthetic Biology he thinks it is one of the most powerful tools of these era, and he dream to work some day on a synthetic biology mediated response against pathogenic infections as HIV and Malaria.  In his experience trough IGEM he is focused on stracting the genes we need out of Vibrio fischeri to create the new biobricks for our project, he also may be a little bit distracted but the fines he payed for that and his work are really helpful.
He got involved with Molecular Biology in the 2002, at the Molecular Biology Estudy Center of the School Gimnacio Campestre in Bogotá [1] . There he worked on different projects including: The development of the Gorgona`s turtle karyotype, the stimulation of bioinsecticide producction by Bacillus thuringiensis by nutrient variations, the searching of new strains of Bacillus thuringiensis in the Colombian Andes, and the characterisation of the genes encoding for natural oxidation in some endemic plants of the Andes region. Now at the Laboratory of Mycology and plant Pathology of the Andes University, under the guidance of Dr. Silvia Restrepo and Dr. Adriana Bernal, he is working on preventing the natural browning of the fruits by silencing the expression of these genes.
Grad students (Also known as the Aging ones!)
Javier Tabima, M. Sc.
Oh noes, the wiki is down!
Javier is a Ph. D. student at the Laboratory of Mycology and Phytopathology and the Group of Computational Biology and Evolution at the Universidad de los Andes . He is a Master of Science and a Bachelor of Science of the Universidad de los Andes where he worked with Molecular phylogenetics and population genetics. His main area of research is Bioinformatics and Molecular Evolution, but he does a little bit of wiki design and tech support once in a while. His role in the group is still unknown, but he does the best to give a little heads up, one or two practical jokes and to draw his lab mates as they work. Additionally, he likes to spend his free time doing slideshows and videos, so lets hope his hobbies are as useful as his bioinformatics knowledge.

Where we come from
Bogotá is the main city and capital of Colombia. With at least 7 million inhabitants, its one of the world's largest cities . It is also the academic central of Colombia, and often called the Athens of South America due to the number of Universities and Libraries (106 Institutes of High Education). The Universidad de los Andes and the Universidad Nacional has been ranked in the top 500 Universities in the world.
Colombia is a country that has been stigmatized as a violent and problematic country, but in the last years the level of security of the country has improved significantly, and tourism has been one oh the main incomes due to the beauty and biodiversity (we are listed as having the fourth highest biodiveristy in the world and de first in amphibians and birds) of the country. Highlands, wet tropical forests and deserts are just two of our many landscapes. Diverse cities, town, and people, coasts in two oceans and the presence of the hugest natural forest (The Amazon) gives the country a touch of diversity and multiclimates, making this one of the culturally and naturally most blessed countries in the world.
People in Colombia are amongst the kindest and coolest people in the world. We are hard working, passionate, highly productive and the girls are beautiful.
We hope, with all our wishes, that you can come to Colombia, to understand and to have the experience of enjoying the Athens of South America!

We prefer cooperation over competition. We adopted a shift based work system in the wet lab it helped us to save time, and allowed many people to work on the same parts of the project. Some team members used to come early in the morning and after dinner their experiments were passed to others, who like working late. Our dry lab worked mainly at home.
Attributions by project:
Synthetic Cloning
RFC that would help other teams perform Synthetic Cloning was prepared by Anna Olchowik and Michał Lower.
RBS Measurement
70 constructs needed for this experiment were cloned by: Dorota Kaja Sabat, Krzysztof Szczepaniak, Elżbieta Jankowska and Paweł Urbański
Parts' characterization using FACS measurements were conducted by Paweł Urbański under the supervision of Cherry Moreno with some help from other team members.
Parts' characterization using fluorimetry was performed by Paweł Urbański. The rest of the team has put significant effort in preparation of bacterial liquid cultures for the measurement. We'd like also thank Radosław Stachowiak, who allowed us access fluorimeter in his lab and advised us about experimental setup.
Expression Adaptors
Constructs were designed by Michał Lower and Anna Olchowik and cloned by Elżbieta, Kaja and Krzysztof
Human Practices
Krzysztof and Paweł have prepared educational materials about synthetic biology and its uses for BioCen, center of BioEducation. The materials will be used by BioCen teachers to show primary and high school students what is Synthetic Biology. Moreover Paweł has prepared more detailed script about physics and modelling in Synthetic Biology directed to undergraduate students. All information is available on BioCen web page (in Polish).
Software
Was designed Michał Lower and implemented by Paweł Urbański under Michał's supervision. The original idea of expression level profiling by applying genetic algorithms and evolution in silico came from Anna Olchowik during one of our brainstorming talks.
Wiki
Team's webpage draft has been coded by Anna Olchowik and Michał Lower, the final webpage has been recoded by a specialist in the field - Marta Błaszkiewicz.
It wouldn't look nice without Ania Puławska hand-made pictures. All members of the team contributed to our wiki.
Fundrising
The whole team have worked hard to organize funding.

Radosław Stachowiak
My adventure with biology and biotechnology dates back to 1995 when I became a biotechnology student at University of Warsaw. In the year 2000 I completed my MSc thesis and I guess I couldn’t stop there so I immidiately started PhD studies. Now I’m done with studying and my job is to take care of students and introduce them into science. Still, I like being involved in crazy projects so characteristic of Sudents’ Societies. The more crazy and incredible project the better. I guess this is the case so here I am!
Ania Puławska
I'm Anna I study biotechnology at Warsaw University, precisely in Department of Virology. I am sure that this is exactly where I should be:) Probably I'm the happiest student in Warsaw:D

Team Description
If you have been interested in the iGEM competition, you probably have noticed that this is the second year that the Chinese University of Hong Kong as one of the participating teams in the world-renowned iGEM competition. We are pleased to have formed a team of 24 undergraduates, of various majors of Science faculty and Engineering faculty. The team is guided by a handful of instructors and supervisors. It is sub-divided into three groups each focusing on one of the aspects of the work, namely characterization, cloning and modeling. Through all hard work preparing for iGEM, we understand much more about Synthetic Biology and we believe the public should also learn more about its principles and benefits to the society. Finally, we hope that all participants will enjoy and have fun in the jamboree!

Hi. I’m Gordon, a year 2 undergraduate student of Biochemistry at CUHK. Since I was a child I was fascinated by numerous amazing scientific discoveries and inventions. Science has always been my favorite subject and the idea of participating in a scientific competition is very appealing to me. iGEM is a golden opportunity for me to learn stuff outside the school’s curriculum such as wet-lab, writing, leadership, social, statistical analysis and presentation skills. The workload can be quite high but it was a worthy experience since iGEM helps to develop my perseverance. It is thrilling to use state-of-the-art instruments that are seldom used by undergraduate students. I’m looking forward to seeing other cool stuff by other teams and that the biobricks will one day contribute to the society.

Hi! I am sally, a year 2 student studying Food and Nutritional Sciences. It is my pleasure to be one of the participants in the iGEM competition this year.  I remember that at the beginning, the term “Synthetic biology” is not familiar to me, what I know about synthetic biology is that it is a combination of biology and engineering. Thanks to this competition, my knowledge of synthetic biology is now enriched. Moreover, this competition gives me a precious chance to learn lots of wet-lab technique and more importantly, gives me an opportunity to meet and work with my nice teammates! The iGEM competition will begin soon and I am looking forward to meeting all the teams from around the world.

This is Sam@ee.cuhk.edu.hk (not an email address actually). The power management circuit that was built easily didn't pass endurance testing (we charged the supercap overnight and its voltage still stayed flat on some low voltage=.="", the reason is that the metal clamps are faulty and they just went off or lose contact over some time, and that was frustrating since we took weeks to isolate the problem=.=). Nevertheless, I enjoy being in the team and tackling problems with helpful hints from instructors. The fun of this competition is that even though deadlines were tight and it seemed lots of things are yet to be done, we still be able to keep everything in check.

I am glad to join the competition for the second time. iGEM is still as fascinating as I joined first time. Its inter-disciplinary nature captures my heart. Where else can we see programmers learn to do wetlab and vice versa besides iGEM? In iGEM I learnt a lot of knowledge that goes far beyond my major, chemistry. iGEM also made me tougher. Doing lab work is tedious yet it is so rewarding when I get nice data.

We are proud to say that all of the ideas we worked on this summer were proposed by undergraduate members of our own team.    We also want to thank all those advisors and instructors who help us discuss these ideas and guided us in doing the experiments.    All experimental data reported by the Tokyo Tech 2011 team comes from experiments done all by undergraduates.
The idea of a human-bacteria Rock-Paper-Scissors game (Tomoyuki Ohno),    the idea of bacteria that could make it rain (Hiroki Yoshise),    and the idea of bacteria that could help us make coolers (Natsuki Kubo)    were all proposed by undergraduate members of our team. Modeling related to our    Rock-Paper-Scissors game was also done by undergraduate students (Alejandro Tsai, Takashi Kitashima)    with the support and guide of our advisor (Hata).

The Team
The team came together during the course 'Mammalian Cell Cultivations for Production of Heterologous Proteins' in the month of June. Due to our late team registration we have been working hard all summer to catch up with the other teams. Luckily Mathilde was able to work full time on the project from August and we recruited a fifth team member Maja who joined us in the middle of August. We are five students from the Technical University of Denmark (DTU) all studying biotechnology at graduate level. The project is conducted at the Center for Microbial Biotechnology, where associate professor Mikael Rørdam Andersen is our supervisor together with Post Doc. Helene Faustrup Kildegaard and Ph.D. Dorte Koefoed Holm.

Preparations
Ethanol is added to the Wash Buffer 1 and the label is marked. Store in airtight container.
Procedures - GE healthcare protocol
Sample Capture
A DNase-free 1,5 ml eppendorf tube is weighed, and the weight is noted.
By using long wavelength (365 nm) ultraviolet light and minimal exposure time, the sample in the gel is visualized. A clean scalpel is used to cut out an the sample from the agarose gel. The agarose gel band is placed into a DNase-free 1,5 ml eppendorf tube and weighed. The weight of the agarose band is calculated.
10 μl Capture buffer type 3 is added for each 10 mg of gel slice. Never use less than 300 μl Capture buffer type 3.
The Capture buffer type 3-sample mix is mixed by inversion and incubated at 60°C for 15–30 minutes until the agarose is completely dissolved. The sample is mixed by inversion every 3 minutes
For each purification a GFX MicroSpin column is placed into a Collection tube.
Sample Binding
The Capture buffer type 3-sample mix is centrifuged briefly to collect the liquid at the bottom of the DNase-free 1,5 ml microcentrifuge tube.
Up to 800 μl Capture buffer type 3- sample mix is transferred to the assembled GFX MicroSpin column.
The sample is incubated at room temperature for 1 minute.
The sample is centrifuged for 30 s at 16 000 × g. The flow-through is discarded.
Repeat the sample binding until all sample is loaded.
Wash and Dry
500 μl Wash buffer type 1 is added to the GFX MicroSpin column.
The sample is centrifuged at 16 000 × g for 30 seconds.
Discard the Collection tube and transfer the GFX MicroSpin column to a new DNase-free 1.5 ml eppendorf tube (supplied by user).
Elution
10–50 μl MilliQ water is added to the center of the membrane in the GFX MicroSpin column placed in a Collection tube. The sample is incubated at room temperature for 1 minute.
The GFX MicroSpin column placed in the Collection tube is centrifuged for 1 minute at 16 000 × g to recover the purified DNA.
The purified DNA is stored at -20°C.

Purification of plasmids for fungi
Materials
The GenElute Plasmid Miniprep Kit from Sigma-Aldrich is used to isolate our plasmids to use in fungi. QIAGENs EndoFree Plasmid Maxi kit is used to purify plasmids for use in mammalian cells.
Preparation
The agents are thoroughly mixed. If any reagent forms a precipitate, warm at 55–65 °C until the precipitate dissolves. Cool to room temperature before use.
The solution is resuspended. Spin the tube of the RNase A Solution briefly to collect the solution in the bottom of the tube. Add 13 μl (for 10 prep package), 78 μl (for 70 prep package) or 500 μl (for 350 prep package) of the RNase A Solution to the Resuspension Solution prior to initial use. Store at 4 °C.
Wash solution; Dilute with 95-100% ethanol prior to initial use.
Procedure - according to the manufactures protocol.
Harvest cells by centrifugation of 5 ml of an overnight recombinant E. coli culture. The optimal volume of culture to use depends upon the plasmid and culture density. For best yields, follow the instructions in the note below. Transfer the appropriate volume of the recombinant E. coli culture to a microcentrifuge tube and pellet cells at ≥12,000 3 g for 1 minute. Discard the supernatant.
Completely resuspend the bacterial pellet with 200 μl of the Resuspension Solution. Vortex or pipette up and down to thoroughly resuspend the cells until homogeneous. Incomplete resuspension will result in poor recovery.
Lyse the resuspended cells by adding 200 μl of the Lysis Solution. Immediately mix the contents by gentle inversion (6–8 times) until the mixture becomes clear and viscous. The lyse reaction must not exceed 5 min.
Precipitate the cell debris by adding 350 μl of the Neutralization/Binding Solution. Gently invert the tube 4–6 times. Pellet the cell debris by centrifuging at ≥12,000*3 g or maximum speed for 10 minutes. Cell debris, proteins, lipids, SDS, and chromosomal DNA should fall out of solution as a cloudy, viscous precipitate.
Prepare columns
Insert a GenElute Miniprep Binding Column into a provided microcentrifuge tube, if not already assembled. Add 500 μl of the Column Preparation Solution to each miniprep column and centrifuge at ≥12,000*3 g for 30 seconds to 1 minute. Discard the flow-through liquid.
Transfer the cleared lysate from step 3 to the column prepared in step 4 and centrifuge at ≥12,000*3 g for 30 seconds to 1 minute. Discard the flow-through liquid.
Add 750 μl of the diluted Wash Solution to the column. Centrifuge at ≥12,000*3 g for 30 seconds to 1 minute. The column wash step removes residual salt and other contaminants introduced during the column load. Discard the flow-through liquid and centrifuge again at maximum speed for 1 to 2 minutes without any additional Wash Solution to remove excess ethanol.
Transfer the column to a fresh collection tube. Add 100 μl of MilliQ water to the column. Centrifuge at ≥12,000*3 g for 1 minute.
The DNA is now present in the eluate and is ready for immediate use or storage at –20 °C.

Simon Koplev
Systems Biology Engineering
I always wanted to be an astronaut. I wanted to travel and uncoil the unknown corridors of space itself. As my envisioned future gradually decayed and steadily got replaced by the grim and earth-bound realities of scholarship, I found myself still gazing towards stellar things. If I could still see them, that is. Eyesight was never a prime attribute due to heavy book-reading. It was at this point in time that I fell in love with the art of pipetting and working long hours in slightly unexplored corners of just about any laboratory, furiously and with great care moving small amounts of liquids from one container to another. As for know this constitutes enough reason for existence, refraining me from killing myself in a freak-space-rocket accident.
Damian Rafal Plichta
Systems Biology Engineering
I always wanted to save the world. Easy said, difficult to do. After all, what does it really mean? Saving the environment from pollution, or eradicating famine, or maybe obliterating poverty... At some point I became interested in biology and genetic engineering, which seems to be a good starting point. With the cutting edge techniques and applications, modern biology offers immense possibilities for improving the quality of life for humankind. I want to contribute to it.  Why not to do iGEM then? With all the crazy ideas people are having, this competition brings you to a new level of realization of what can be done.
Lars Roed Ingerslev
Systems Biology Engineering
I will freely admit that I have always been a bit of a science geek. Initially physics was the dream, I wanted to go to space (and preferably build the rocket myself), but sometime during my high school studies, my interest in planets and black holes was diminished and the workings of the cell became the focus of my affection.
So what better way to go than studying Biotechnology? That was where I met what has become my other academic interest: statistics and data analysis. Fortunately modern biology is full of data and there is plenty of room for people who want to spend hours in front of the computer, analyzing the latest high-throughput genome sequencing experiment.
Jing Zhao
Biotechnology Engineering
Believe it or not, my dream is to become artist or writer. The reason why I choose Biotechnology as my major is that I also interested in science and want to solve problems such as energy, environment and human health with this technology in the future. Fortunately, I can take part in IGEM and it is a very special experience for me to know a lot of friends and learn knowledge at the same time.
Helle Krogh Pedersen
Systems Biology Engineering
As a naive highscholer I wanted to save the world, to make the world a better place. I wanted to save millions of lives by being the one inventing the AIDS vaccine, finding the cure for Alzheimer or eliminating malaria. Full of hope I started at uni, just to experience that the simple “DNA” and “protein” appeared to be much more complex and I slowly started to realize that saving the world is not something you just do after studying biology for half a year. This realization was combined with frustrating, but time passed, good things happened and suddenly I found myself in the middle of a fascinating iGEM project. It will not save the world tomorrow, but it might be one of the many small steps which in the future will lead to groundbreaking scientific discoveries.
Anna Lewińska
Systems Biology Engineering
Do the words such as “mystery”, “unknown” make you excited? Do you wonder how it will be to wander in the labyrinths of forgotten places? Don’t you want to unravel all the secrets? If so you are exactly like me. I always wanted to be like Indiana Jones or Sherlock Holmes. However, as the real life came it pulled me down to earth. But still I found a field that is very close to my dream. It was of course, molecular biology. It seems like a maze with a lot of dead-ends, but when you managed to find the right path and solve all the puzzles, there is a huge treasure awaiting for you. That is why, long hours in laboratory or reading fascinatingly.
Helge Munk Jacobsen
Software Engineering
Okay, I admit it! I have no clue what this synthetic biology is all about. I don’t know what RNA is, and I can’t tell you what protein has to do with it. But, what I do know, is how to redesign a wiki page, and how to present complicated academical stuff in a way that is easy to understand. And the fact that I don’t have any kind of biotech knowledge actually just made this task a lot easier.

DiscoverE Science Fun Day
Science - it's never too early to start learning         about the world around us!
While most iGEM teams have historically focused on         educational outreach in the high school setting, Team         Alberta wanted to ensure that many students had a head-start          to their genetics education.
In August, Team Alberta invited campers ranging from grades 4-6 from the DiscoverE Summer Program         into our lab space for a morning of fun-filled science         activities! DiscoverE is an 'engaging activity-based'         summer camp whose programs allow students to explore new         ideas through hands-on projects related to a variety         of fields in the science, engineering and technology         disciplines.
Our science fun day activities included:
Presenting our project to students in an approachable and easily-understandable way!
Extracting DNA from strawberries!
Drinking delicious ice cream floats!
Sharing members of Adam's reptilian collection!
Experiencing the energy harnessed by chemical             reactions through a Diet Pepsi - Mentos geyser!
We started the morning with Kayla presenting the         educational video that she had created. The video was         made with the intent of making our project approachable         and understandable and it allowed the campers to get an         overview of the large project that we've been attempting to         undertake: ""Neurospora [...] proceeds to eat a variety of         waste substances, this causes the Neurospora to get fatter         and fatter"".
Before the campers began extracting DNA from strawberries,         Helena asked them about the molecule. When asked what is         DNA and what does it do, these intelligent campers gave a         range of responses including ""it determines whether you         have brown eyes or blue eyes, brown hair or blonde hair""         and ""it's the instructions for living things."" Team         Alberta was incredibly impressed when one camper was even         able to tell us that ""DNA is like a spirally ladder         - a helix!""
But why only talk about DNA? In contrast to traditional         iGEM outreach programs which generally only lecture about         DNA, Team Alberta provided campers with the opportunity         to see the molecule they were learning about! In our         lab, campers were given the opportunity to extract         DNA from purchased strawberries through an isopropanol         precipitation procedure! The experiment provided campers         with the opportunity not only to observe what DNA looks         like to the naked eye but also to learn that DNA is found         in everything living and once living, including the food         that we eat. If you would like to repeat our experiment         you can find the instructions here .
Next, Adam shared three members of his large reptilian         collection with the campers while they enjoyed root beer         floats. In addition to talking about the climates that these         species live in, he also reemphasized to the campers that         DNA is also found within these interesting creatures.
Energy being the focus of our project, Team Alberta         wanted to complete the morning with a fun and exciting         demonstration that visually allowed the campers to see the         energy that could be released from chemical reactions. Ray and         Mike were the brave members of our team who volunteered to         exhibit that much energy could be released from the reaction         of Diet Pepsi and Mentos.
Through these activities we hope that we achieved our         goals of teaching the campers about the roles of DNA and         the variety of organisms in which it is found, making DNA         more approachable to younger individuals, and providing         the campers with a memorable experience.
Women in Scholarship, Engineering, Science and Technology             (WISEST) Lab Tours
Students from the WISEST program visited Team Alberta         over the lunch hour on two occasions.  The WISEST Summer         Research Program provides young women that have completed         grade 11 with the opportunity to gain experience in science         or engineering settings by working as research assistants         throughout the summer.
Students were given a tour of our lab, a brief overview         of the iGEM competition and our project itself.  They were         also given the opportunity to view our race tubes, to         count conidia on a hemocytometer and to view an undergoing         esterification reaction.
But, science is often unapproachable. Students may listen         to a talk, but retain little. Instead, Team Alberta invited         these students to sit down for lunch over pizza and discuss         synthetic biology and perhaps any apprehensions that they may         have about the field. In an informal environment, our team         members described the field to students and its applications         and answered any questions that were posed. Students were         also provided with the opportunity to ask team members         general questions about their experiences as undergrad         students.
To determine whether our team had achieved its goals         through conducting these lab tours, students in attendance         were all sent an anonymous, voluntary electronic feedback         survey. Though thirty-six WISEST students attended the         tours on both days combined, nineteen students provided         responses. The following is intended as a summary of the         results of this survey.
WISEST students were asked to anonymously select which         statements they agreed with.

Heritage Youth Researcher Summer (HYRS) Program Lab Tour
Team Alberta was also given the opportunity to share our         project and knowledge about synthetic biology with students         from the HYRS program. HYRS is a summer studentship program         developed and funded by the Alberta Heritage Foundation for         Medical Research (AHFMR) that provides both male and female         students who have completed grade 11 with experience in the         sciences at provincial universities.
Similarly, students were given a tour of our lab and an         overview of the iGEM competition in addition to the opportunity         to view the many interesting experiments conducted as part of         our project such as our race tube experiments. As well, these         students were invited to participate in an informal discussion about synthetic biology over         over pizza and to ask questions of our         team.

This year, the University of Alberta team, Team Alberta,         was composed of seven undergraduate students who represent         four departments across our campus. We worked tirelessly in a         lab throughout the entire summer, conducting our project and         making the ambitious plans that we had set out to complete         a reality. Along the way, we gained invaluable lab experience         and had a memorable summer working together.
Each team member's diverse skills, background, and         talents were most important to our success. Please click         on each student's photo on the right-hand side below to learn         more about them and to read their submitted biography.
Team Members
Kayla Baretta
I am in my fourth year of a Bachelors of Science in             Biochemistry and my first year of iGEM. I plan on             pursuing a career in research and I felt that iGEM             would be a unique experience and opportunity to not             only meet people from around world, but to also broaden             my understanding of science within and outside of the             scientific community. When I am not pursuing my studies,             I enjoy making cupcakes, reading, playing with my dog,             and eating cupcakes.
Adam Foster
I have an undergrad in General Science, with a focus on Genetics and Organic Chemistry.  I tried an After Degree in Education, but did not complete it. I have been diagnosed with Asperger's Syndrome, and am seeking a diagnosis for Irlen Syndrome.
In addition to iGEM this summer, I am researching a novel pigment pathway; however, I'm not motivated to do research as a career. I hope to work at the local museum as a curator, and conduct my research as a hobbyist. I currently maintain approximately 50 temperate and tropical vivaria of orchids, geckos, frogs and boa constrictors, with a focus on Amazonian, Indonesian, Madagascan, and New Caledonian rainforests. I also have a blue eyed, all white cat, and a very understanding wife. One day, I would like to visit the ecosystems that I am so fascinated with.
Yuan Guo
Hello! I am in my fourth year of a B Sc. Hon. in Biochemistry. This is my first year of iGEM and I am having a great time so far. I got involved with iGEM because it was an unique opportunity for to meet some fellow science students from around the world. Furthermore, it was the perfect chance to put the knowledge obtained in classrooms to practical use.
Raymond Odsen
My name is Raymond Odsen and I am going into my fourth year in a B Sc. Hon. in Biochemistry. I think biochemistry is an awesome way to enter the scientific community,and I got into the iGEM project because I wanted a practical laboratory experience and the chance to work in a student-directed environment. My focus in studies is in the environmental and chemical aspects of biochemical manipulation, as well as the physics behind biochemical pathways and techniques. I plan to do an honors thesis next year in purifying proteins involved in the progression of breast cancer; I am very much looking forward to it. When not in the lab, I like to think about the lab and consider marrying the lab.
Murray Pelech
I recently completed my Baccalaureates sciences at the University of Alberta with a major in biology and minor in chemistry.
Michael Simpson
I have just completed my undergraduate degree with a B Sc. with Specialization in Biochemistry. Currently, I am seeking to pursue graduate studies at the University of Alberta. iGEM allows me to become more familiar with genetics and synthetic biology.
Helen Zakrzewski
Currently, I am in my last year of a B Sc. Hon. in Immunology and Infection and I recently completed my undergraduate honors thesis, which focused on determining the role of natural killer cells in the induction of chimerism and transplantation tolerance. Though to some extent outside the scope of my previous experiences, I was drawn to iGEM as the competition allows students from a variety of backgrounds to collaborate on a unique project and oversee its completion from concept to presentation. In my spare time I enjoy snowboarding and taking my Labrador Retriever on runs through our river valley. (photo disclaimer - I wrote a 5.5 hour exam the morning of our afternoon photo shoot and hadn't slept in days)
About our Wiki

Team
The team has doubled its size compared to 2010, to reach two main objectives: reinforce the different fields that work together in a Synthetic Biology project and give the chance to other professors and students to participate in the contest, making the UPO a prominent university in this area.
Instructors
Fernando Govantes Romero (Microbiology)
Over the years evolved to be called Fernan and then Fer... I may end up losing my name altogether. I am the grandfather of the team and I run the Foundational Advances subteam. Best known for my secular knowledge on bacterial strain genotypes, transposons and other genetic gimmicks, as well ancient protocols and media recipes.
Luis Merino Cabañas (Systems engineering)
What's doing a roboticist with a bunch of biotechnologists? Surprisingly (actually, not so) the same as before: engineering. I'm co-advising the dry-lab with my colleague Manuel (master of MATLAB and huge models). After a fast immersion last year into the (very) basics of genetic engineering, I'm still enjoying learning a lot of new things and the possibilities we have to manipulate or create new biological robots. And I met some of the creators of ARPANET in the way!!!
Manuel Béjar Domínguez (Systems engineering)
Antonio Jesús Pérez Pulido (Bioinformatics)
I am the motorized man in the group, and I don't walk but I am going on my wheels. The sequence and structure analyses are my expertise, using and developing bioinformatics tools.
Antonio Prado Moreno (Animal physiology)
Víctor Álvarez Tallada (Genetics)
This is Victor, I am one of the new supervisors recruited (on my way to the toilet !!)    for this year iGem adventure. Genetics is what I enjoy the most. I give advice to Felix and Yolanda; together we are what they call ""V subteam"".
Rafael Rodríguez Daga (Genetics)
I am a full professor of Genetics at the University Pablo de Olavide in Seville. I have joined the UPO-Sevilla Team this year. I supervise Paola in the experimental designing and construction of the epigenetic bistable using fission yeast S. pombe as model organism.
Undergrads
Adrián Arellano Davín (Biotechnology)
If you look for somebody who really loves science and learning, it is Adrián.    He will read every book he can get his hands on. He is a physicist enthusiast and a renowned go player. Adrián was the first in discovering iGEM and we have to thank him for passing on us his passion for learning beyond the degree. This year he jumped to the DryLab and he is doing great visual and parametric simulations.
David Caballero Pradas (Biotechnology)
He is a non-stopping man and the engine of the team. David is always working and thinking about every detail that can make our project better. Some people say that he never sleeps. He plays the electric-guitar and loves rollerblading. Also, he is becoming famous because of his many performances in TV. David is working in the Foundational Advance project of the team, a transposon based system to deliver BioBricks into microbial genomes.
Paola Gallardo Palomo (Biotechnology)
This quick-moving and hard-working woman could do an iGEM project by herself. Her evil look is legendary and you don’t want to disturb her when she is focused. Her not-speak-much and think-fast style is the behavior that a young scientist should subscribe. Paola managed most of our founding and is working on bistability in the epigenetic level, regulating transcription by chromatin compacting in fission yeast.
Yolanda Elisabet Gonzalez Flores (Biotechnology)
I am Yolanda, also called Yoly or even Yolibeth by my friends. I am the errant iGEMer, as this year I'll spend half of the summer working in Santander. I am a bio-geek and a T4 phage lover, and I have joint the team this year. I'm working with Felix on the optimization of the bistable by proteolysis and asRNA.
José Gutiérrez Tabuenca (Computer engineering)
What is the result of mixing Software Engineering and Synthetic Biology? This is me. After years learning about software programming, I have joined the iGEM UPO team in order to learn and to try to share my knowledge with this new amazing discipline. Together with my iGEM partners, I've developed the BioBrick Creator software tool to help creating BioBricks, saving a lot of time in the process. I hope to help iGEM teams in the future with this new software tool.
Jesús Jiménez Sobrado (Industrial engineering)
I'm the last incorporation to the group. Proteases, ribosomes or polypeptides were such a nightmare to me. I'm an engineering student and all of this is really far from me. Altough I came with no idea about biology or genetic, I've been learning... so I tried to make a good work. When I first met the group, it seemed to me quite insane... finally I found I became one of them.
Amalia Martinez Segura (Biotechnology)
I'm yet one more of the newbies in the team, and one more Biotechnology student. I define myself as a curious person, which makes me read every book I can get my hands on. I spend the rest of my spare time playing videogames and watching films and TV shows. My duty in the team is to describe the behavior of the basic biestable to its last detail, so we can show how the performance improves when adding the modifications the other subteams are working on.
Aída Moreno Moral (Biotechnology)
After years of carrying my huge friend (the double bass), I moved from music to Biological Sciences, which as not many may know, aren't completely different fields as they can look! As a bassist I learned that complex systems always start from good bases. I am one of the new acquisitions of the UPO-iGEM team. So what do I do?  I juggle between the dry and wet labs, performing bioinformatics analyses while also trying to assist in the dry lab's biological issues.
Luis Eduardo Pavón (Computer engineering)
This is my second year in iGEM competition. I belong to Dry Lab and this time I design this wonderful Wiki and the cute Logo. This time, I've been working around Sinthetic Biology, I've learnt many words: ""promotor"", ""terminator"", ""ribosome binding site""... although I still don't know the meaning of them all.
Félix Reyes Martín (Biotechnology)
Probably, i'm the laziest member of the team, at least that's what my friends usually say. However, when it comes to working in the lab, i always intent to give the best of myself. This is my second year in UPO sevilla team and although last year I worked really hard on it, I'm feeling even more eager this year. I belong to the V's subteam (a little group inside wet lab workers) and we will try to set up some improvements in the classic toggle switch.

The project team structure can be seen at the Team page. All work has been developed by the undergraduate students of the team. The main role of the instructors has been to give advice through project or subproject meetings, and provide access and space at their labs. Moreover, all the contents on the wiki have been produced by the students, with some polishing by the instructors.
Here we show the attributions of the different subprojects:
The miniTn7 BioBrick tool kit subproject has been fully developed by David Caballero, a third-year student of Biotechnology, under the supervision of Fernando Govantes, Associate Professor of Microbiology. All lab-work and design of miniTn7 derivatives has been undergone by this student and periodically debated in UPO-Sevilla team meetings. For more information about the work behind this Foundational Advance project, please read David Caballero's diary .
The BioBrick Creator software tool has been fully coded by José Gutiérrez, an undergrad on Computer Science, with the help of Aída Moreno, a last-year student of Biotechnology. They have been instructed mainly by Associate Professor Antonio J. Pérez, PhD on Bioinformatics. More details can be found in the associated notebook .
The experiments and characterization of the Basic Flip-Flop have been performed and analyzed by Amalia Martínez (check her diary for further information), undergraduate student of Biotechnology, under the supervision of Fernando Govantes.
The Spatial Multiagent Simulation of the Basic Flip-Flop, employing the tool NetLogo, has been developed completely by Adrián Arellano, a third-year undergrad student of Biotechnology. He has designed and implemented the interfaces and the code associated with the simulation ( his diary ). He has been instructed by Luis Merino, Associate Professor on Systems Engineering and Automation, which contributed with advice in the development of the simulations and discussions on the results.
The development of the Improved Flip-Flop has been carried out by Yolanda Elisabeth González and Félix Reyes, both third-year undergraduate students of Biotechnology, under the instruction of Víctor Álvarez, Associate Professor in Genetics. Their struggle along the summer can be found here .
All the lab work, experimental design and analysis in the development of the Epigenetic Flip-Flop has been performed by Paola Gallardo ( her diary ), third-year undergrad on Biotechnology. She has been instructed by Rafael Rodriguez, Associate Professor of Genetics, who has collaborated in the design of the device and has provided further advice.
The Bioinformatics tools and analysis of the the Improved Flip-Flop and the Epigenetic Flip-Flop , as well as the miniTn7 BioBrick Tool have also been performed by Aída Moreno (check her daily work on this), under the instruction of Antonio J. Pérez.
The Wiki design and code, as well as management, is due to Luis Eduardo Pavón, a Computer Science undergrad ( his diary ), supervised by Luis Merino and all the UPO-Sevilla team.
The modeling (using MATLAB and MATLAB's Simbiology) and the mathematical analysis of the Basic and Improved Flip-Flops has been carried out by Jesús Jiménez, an undergrad on Mechanical and Systems Engineering. He has developed the Simbiology models and MATLAB code in full, under the supervision of Manuel Béjar and Luis Merino, as it is narrated in his diary .

Gurpal Bisra I am an engineering physics student, in my final year of undergrad, interested in pursuing bioengineering or biomedical engineering. I joined the iGEM team to further develop my biological skills and apply my engineering skills to a real life biological problem. I have traveled to 14 countries so far and my thirst for adventure never ceases! For our wet lab component, I developed a yeast cell to contain the mutant erg20-2 gene and made ERG20 and erg20-2 bio-bricks. I also helped develop plasmids that contain the K6R-HMG2 and IDI1 genes. My contribution to modeling was to simulate the biochemical pathways for our genetically engineered yeasts. I programmed simulations using MATLAB. Furthermore, I am helping to develop another model which shows the spread of the pine beetle using ARCGIS.
Daisy Ji I am a Pharmacy student interested in translational research. One of the interesting aspects of iGEM is the multidisciplinary approach it takes towards a whole variety of problems. My project consists of expressing 3-carene synthase in yeast and also submitting the 3-carene synthase as a biobrick part. Also, I will be truncating the 3-carene synthase to increase the catalytic efficiency of the enzyme. I am also working to characterize the composite limonene synthase part from the Parts Registry by expressing it in C41 DE3 cells and assaying its limonene production in vitro. I enjoy reading books and playing chess. I also enjoy working out at Birdcoop and ballin'.
Marianne Park I completed my Bachelor of Science at UBC this year and am beginning a new and exciting journey as a first year medical student at UBC this fall. After my fantastic experience as a UBC iGEM team member last year, I decided to stay on the team for another great year of learning, research experience, friendship, and memories. This year, I am on the wetlab track once again and am working with the beta-pinene synthase to create a biobrick part and to overexpress it in yeast to characterize it under GPD and GAL promoters, with and without the erg20-2 and IDI1 gene.
Vicki Ma I completed a Bachelor of Science at UBC this year, and will be going to McGill in the fall to study Occupational Therapy with my fiance (we're recently engaged!) who is beginning his Masters in Medical Physics. This is my second year with UBC iGEM, and I am excited to share my experiences from last year as well as create new memories and stories from this year. My main wetlab role is to obtain limonene synthase from the biobrick registry and overexpress it in yeast for characterization purposes in order to meet the gold medal criteria. I am also assisting the beta-pinene synthase track to yield a variety of yeast plasmids for characterization purposes. At the same time, I am working on formatting and designing our wiki.
Joe Ho I am a 4th year science student at UBC, with the interest of virology and molecular genetics. I'm excited to discover what synthetic biology means to me, to my community, and to the world. For me, science is about making connections and iGEM is a great starting point! With previous lab experience in a medical science lab, iGEM offers another wonderful opportunity for me to explore other fields of science with the hope that one day both of these experiences will connect me to what I want to do in the future. My wetlab role for this project is on the cloning of alpha pinene monoterpene synthase into yeast cells while incorporating other parts to improve productions of monoterpenes. At the same time, I am part of the modelling team, using ArcGIS to simulate the spread of the pine beetle infestation upon introduction of our product.
Samuel Wu I've just finished my third year in engineering physics and joined the team to explore Synthetic Biology, a longtime fascination.  My role with the wet lab is to create a genetic construct for the dual expression of two genes (IDI1, HMG-2) encoding enzymes for the melavonate pathway, which supplies the substrate for the monoterpenes.  This construct will hopefully boost production of terpenes in yeast expressing a synthase.
Jacob Toth I am a biochemistry student at UBC going into my second year. I joined iGEM to get involved in the world-changing field of synthetic biology, and I am very excited about our project! Outside of science, other interests of mine include playing my violin, studying philosophy, and enjoying nature. My roles on the team include preparing two versions of the 1,8-cineole synthase gene to be put into yeast to be over expressed and working with the ArcGIS program to model the spread of the mountain pine beetle when treated by our products.
Laura Bain I have many loves in life including snowboarding, windsurfing, sailing, biking, gardening AND Biology! I am pumped to be on this year's iGEM team because we are a diverse bunch and have so much to learn from each other! I am very enthusiastic about biology and people so it is a natural fit for me to be spearheading the Human Practices project. I am keen to engage the community in discussions about synthetic biology in non-traditional ways: Creative art projects, videos, forums, roadside chats. Also, It is especially exciting to be partnering with Science World in mentoring and educating Vancouver high school students. We hope to inspire these teenagers to pursue future opportunities in Science and maybe even a 2012 Vancouver Highschool iGEM team!

So you want to be an iGEMer
Mentoring Young Scientists - Outreach at Science World September 20, 2011
The UBC iGEM 2011 team collaborated with Science World and Future Leaders in Science to deliver a synthetic biology workshop to select high school students and potentially foster the creation of a high school British Columbia iGEM team!
We are thankful to Dr. Catherine Anderson, Program Manager of Future Science Leaders for the opportunity to take part in this innovative program!
We introduced synthetic biology and iGEM to the high school students and guided them through a plasmid activity aimed at solving a real world problem by creating a plasmid with appropriate parts. Our workshop outline can be found at the wiki for iGEM outreach .
Check out our clip of ""A Day in the Life... of an iGEMer"" and lab safety:
The idea behind the “Day in the Life” video was to provide a sneak peek for Young Scientists to see what a lab looks like, where we do research and all the exciting things go on.
We incorporated safety considerations such as:
Always have proper footwear (ie. bare feet is UNACCEPTABLE and flip flops aren’t good either)
Wear long pants
Have long hair tied back
No food or drink in the lab (fuel up before you head in!)
Wear a lab coat
Always work with someone else in the lab, never work alone.
Wear gloves (for sanitary high-fives)
Use a proper lab notebook to keep a record of your lab work
and many other things that can be spotted in the video...
We wanted to show off the beautiful Michael Smith building where we not only do research, but have meetings (sometimes long ones as in the video), connect with other scientists, hang out, laugh (and cry) and get lost in the hallways...
There were also some extra Science-y tidbits thrown in there which have very little to do with our project (ahem, liquid nitrogen? It is just too cool to leave out).
Guide to Starting a High School iGEM Team
The purpose of this guide to provide a universally applicable guide for how to start a high-school iGEM team in the spirit of continuing the mentorship mentality of iGEM. Our team is striving to create a simple system outlining what necessary steps need to take place in order to achieve this goal. This is a new approach to Human Practices and although this is currently only a guide, we are passionate to see this as a working model and ignite collaboration between iGEM universities.
As a new iGEMer, I, Laura was impressed by the inherent mentorship model of this competition. It is clear that a team of Undergraduates cannot function in and of themselves. I have experienced firsthand the invaluable support from Graduate students who sacrifice their time and energy to impart their knowledge to us. Also, there is the necessary support and guidance from Faculty advisers who advocate for lab space, network us with other faculty and provide thoughtful advice in times of troubleshooting. It is clear that there is a thread on mentorship within the iGEM community and we wish to extend that into the high-school iGEM division. In doing so, we anticipate growing as individuals and as a team while passing along the tidbits of knowledge we have gathered since graduation.
Our guide to facilitating the start of a high school iGEM team can be downloaded or found on this CommunityBricks page .
Human Practices Reflections and Future Directions
I, Laura, think back to the Spring when our team first formed and I excitedly volunteered to lead the Human Practices pillar.  I was brimming with passion, ideas and naivety. It has been interesting to compare my expectations and objectives for the summer to what we have actually achieved and what objectives we have fulfilled.
It is a mixture of satisfaction and disappointment on my part. I had high hopes for all the things I would accomplish and then the summer months flashed by to this point of a nearly frozen wiki. That isn’t to say that I don’t have great pride for what we have done and where our initiatives will lead us apart from iGEM. The unfinished objectives are not failures, they are pre-formed possibilities for next year’s team!
It was important for us to invest our time into something sustainable and accessible. With regards to sustainability, we have had some keen responses from Future Science Leaders interested in being involved with our 2012 iGEM project (whatever that may be) or to start a team of their own. We wish to continue fostering relationship with these kids and be available for potential mentoring opportunities. In terms of accessibility, we have been trying to contribute to the Outreach page as much as possible and will continue to do so after the wiki freeze and even after Regionals. We aspire for our work to be accessible and replicable we found the Outreach Page to be the perfect portal.
In all, it was a good time. I definitely laughed a lot, I also cried a bit, and I worked with some amazing people. I can honestly say that this experience has changed me and I won’t ever be the same. I am looking forward to another epic year for British Columbia iGEM team in 2012!!

Gurpal Bisra I am an engineering physics student, in my final year of undergrad, interested in pursuing bioengineering or biomedical engineering. I joined the iGEM team to further develop my biological skills and apply my engineering skills to a real life biological problem. I have traveled to 14 countries so far and my thirst for adventure never ceases! For our wet lab component, I developed a yeast cell to contain the mutant erg20-2 gene and made ERG20 and erg20-2 bio-bricks. I also helped develop plasmids that contain the K6R-HMG2 and IDI1 genes. My contribution to modeling was to simulate the biochemical pathways for our genetically engineered yeasts. I programmed simulations using MATLAB. Furthermore, I am helping to develop another model which shows the spread of the pine beetle using ARCGIS.
Daisy Ji I am a Pharmacy student interested in translational research. One of the interesting aspects of iGEM is the multidisciplinary approach it takes towards a whole variety of problems. My project consists of expressing 3-carene synthase in yeast and also submitting the 3-carene synthase as a biobrick part. Also, I will be truncating the 3-carene synthase to increase the catalytic efficiency of the enzyme. I am also working to characterize the composite limonene synthase part from the Parts Registry by expressing it in C41 DE3 cells and assaying its limonene production in vitro. I enjoy reading books and playing chess. I also enjoy working out at Birdcoop and ballin'.
Marianne Park I completed my Bachelor of Science at UBC this year and am beginning a new and exciting journey as a first year medical student at UBC this fall. After my fantastic experience as a UBC iGEM team member last year, I decided to stay on the team for another great year of learning, research experience, friendship, and memories. This year, I am on the wetlab track once again and am working with the beta-pinene synthase to create a biobrick part and to overexpress it in yeast to characterize it under GPD and GAL promoters, with and without the erg20-2 and IDI1 gene.
Vicki Ma I completed a Bachelor of Science at UBC this year, and will be going to McGill in the fall to study Occupational Therapy with my fiance (we're recently engaged!) who is beginning his Masters in Medical Physics. This is my second year with UBC iGEM, and I am excited to share my experiences from last year as well as create new memories and stories from this year. My main wetlab role is to obtain limonene synthase from the biobrick registry and overexpress it in yeast for characterization purposes in order to meet the gold medal criteria. I am also assisting the beta-pinene synthase track to yield a variety of yeast plasmids for characterization purposes. At the same time, I am working on formatting and designing our wiki.
Joe Ho I am a 4th year science student at UBC, with the interest of virology and molecular genetics. I'm excited to discover what synthetic biology means to me, to my community, and to the world. For me, science is about making connections and iGEM is a great starting point! With previous lab experience in a medical science lab, iGEM offers another wonderful opportunity for me to explore other fields of science with the hope that one day both of these experiences will connect me to what I want to do in the future. My wetlab role for this project is on the cloning of alpha pinene monoterpene synthase into yeast cells while incorporating other parts to improve productions of monoterpenes. At the same time, I am part of the modelling team, using ArcGIS to simulate the spread of the pine beetle infestation upon introduction of our product.
Samuel Wu I've just finished my third year in engineering physics and joined the team to explore Synthetic Biology, a longtime fascination.  My role with the wet lab is to create a genetic construct for the dual expression of two genes (IDI1, HMG-2) encoding enzymes for the melavonate pathway, which supplies the substrate for the monoterpenes.  This construct will hopefully boost production of terpenes in yeast expressing a synthase.
Jacob Toth I am a biochemistry student at UBC going into my second year. I joined iGEM to get involved in the world-changing field of synthetic biology, and I am very excited about our project! Outside of science, other interests of mine include playing my violin, studying philosophy, and enjoying nature. My roles on the team include preparing two versions of the 1,8-cineole synthase gene to be put into yeast to be over expressed and working with the ArcGIS program to model the spread of the mountain pine beetle when treated by our products.
Laura Bain I have many loves in life including snowboarding, windsurfing, sailing, biking, gardening AND Biology! I am pumped to be on this year's iGEM team because we are a diverse bunch and have so much to learn from each other! I am very enthusiastic about biology and people so it is a natural fit for me to be spearheading the Human Practices project. I am keen to engage the community in discussions about synthetic biology in non-traditional ways: Creative art projects, videos, forums, roadside chats. Also, It is especially exciting to be partnering with Science World in mentoring and educating Vancouver high school students. We hope to inspire these teenagers to pursue future opportunities in Science and maybe even a 2012 Vancouver Highschool iGEM team!
Graduate Advisors
Alina Chan I am a PhD student in the Hieter lab utilizing yeast as a model eukaryote to study the connection between chromosomal instability and RNA processing. This is my second year with the UBC iGEM team and I'm super excited that the team is using yeast to produce monoterpenes. My main wet lab role is to train team members in the art of working with yeast and help with general troubleshooting, experimental design and wiki design. I also advise the modeling and human practices sub-teams by helping them set objectives and integrate our wet lab experience into the models and outreach. Additionally, I'm responsible for the yeastie comics and xtranormal videos on the wiki. Boston, here we come!
Rafael Saer I am a PhD student in the Beatty lab, studying the ramifications of aliphatic side chain mutations on the rate of primary electron transfer events in bacterial photosynthetic reaction centers. This is my second year being a Graduate advisor for iGEM.  My purpose in the team is to provide advice during the meetings as well as troubleshooting assistance to any wet lab issues that may arise.  I often find myself being a gopher for sundry reagents and buffers that the iGEM team may require. I enjoy hiking, biking, reading, video games, and a nice pint of good beer.
  We have also received modeling advice from:
Shing Hei Zhan I am a first-year PhD student at the BC Genome Sciences Centre studying cancer genomics and C. elegans genetics. I participated in iGEM 2010 as an undergraduate team member, modeling the response of a bacterial biofilm to a biofilm-degrading phage. This year, I have returned as an Advisor for the modeling team. Vergil's Aeneid is my favorite verse.

Dr. Anders Nygren
I have a PhD from Rice University, Houston, Texas, and MSc degrees from the University of Houston, Texas and the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm, Sweden. I am an Associate Professor in the Centre for Bioengineering Research & Education and the Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering at the University of Calgary. My main research interests deal with the electrophysiology of the heart, using a combination of experimental measurements and computer modeling. I realized a few years ago that the modeling methods used in this research also can be applied to an area I knew nothing about at the time: Synthetic Biology. This is the third time I am involved as one of the facilitators for a U of C iGEM team. The idea of applying engineering methods to biology just keeps getting more fascinating to me the more I learn about it. This year, I am particularly excited about the fact that we have built a team with students from three faculties joining forces to address a problem of great relevance to our local economy.

Dr. Lisa Gieg
I have been doing research in the field of environmental and petroleum microbiology for 20 years.  I obtained my BSc and PhD degrees from the University of Alberta, then worked as a Senior Research Associate at the University of Oklahoma for a dozen years before returning to Alberta as an Assistant Professor in Biological Sciences at the University of Calgary.  My research has focused on the aerobic and anaerobic biodegradation of hydrocarbons in the context of oil spill bioremediation and microbially enhanced energy recovery.  Since arriving at the U of C, I’ve also been examining the microbiology of oil sands tailings ponds with an eye towards how microbes can be used in their bioreclamation.  This is my first time being involved in iGEM.  I am very excited by the possibility that tools of synthetic biology can be used to help in the tailings ponds biotreatment and hope to learn a lot about all aspects of iGEM from our dynamic and diverse group of students!

About Calgary
Calgary is the largest city in Alberta, and has a population of over 1 million.  It was founded in 1875, when the RCMP erected Fort Calgary (then Fort Brisebois) to protect the western plains from whiskey traders. When the Canadian Pacific Railway reached the area in 1883, Calgary grew into an important commercial and agricultural center. Currently, Calgary's economy is dominated by the oil and gas industry, and major attractions include Canada Olympic Park (the site of the 1988 Winter Olympics), Calaway Park, the Lilac Festival, and the Calgary Stampede (an annual agricultural fair founded in 1905).  Calgary is also situated near the Rocky Mountains, and plays host to a unique weather phenomenom called the chinook. Famous Calgarians include the young, incumbent mayor, Naheed Nenshi, who is the first Muslim to become mayor of a major Canadian city, as well as the current Prime Minister of Canada, Conservative leader Stephen Harper.
The University of Calgary
The University of Calgary is ranked as one of Canada’s top comprehensive research institutions. Currently, more than 30,500 students are enrolled in 14 faculties in undergraduate, graduate and professional degree programs. The University contains more than 30 research institutions and centres, including the O’Brien Centre within which iGEM Calgary operates. The university is also the birthplace of many inventions including the neurochip, and has had 140,000 alumni since its founding in 1966.
The O'Brien Centre for the Health Sciences
The O' Brien Centre for the Health Sciences is located in the Foothills campus of the University of Calgary. It has provided the iGEM team with lab space as well as funding. The O’Brien Centre was founded by David O’ Brien, who is a member of the Board of Directors at the U of C. The O’Brien Centre is the hub of top-notch interdisciplinary research and education. It funds approximately 9 million dollars a year for research. The 2011 iGEM team thanks the O’Brien Centre for the O’Brien Centre Summer Studentships, awarded to three of our members, as well as lab space, materials, and equipment for this year.

Chelsea Leishman
I just finished my fourth year of Biological Sciences specializing in Cellular, Molecular and Microbial Biology at the University of Calgary. I have research experience related to the phytoremediation of the oil sands and as such, I hope I will be able to apply some of that knowledge to this project. I have never been involved in iGEM before, but I am very excited to be participating in the wet lab portion of it this year. I am positive that iGEM will be a great opportunity to learn about synthetic biology and to develop my independent research skills. Some of my interests outside of academia include playing competitive soccer, riding my bike and traveling.

Emily Hicks
This will be my third summer as a member of the University of Calgary’s iGEM team and as always I am super excited for the year.  I will predominantly be helping out in the wetlab and marketing aspects of the project this season. I’m most excited about showcasing our project as well as teaching others on the team.  I am also very excited about working with a new group of people this year on a subject brand new to me.  I know that I will gain a ton of new knowledge this summer and have a chance to hopefully step out of my comfort zone and learn a bit more about modeling and website design.  In the fall I will be going into my fourth year of biomedical sciences, and I bring my previous lab experience as well as my theatre experience in public speaking to the team.  In my spare time I am involved in theatre in Calgary as well as competitive highland dancing.

Robert Mayall
Hi, I'm Robert, and I'm in my third year of Biomedical Sciences at the U of C. I've never done any kind of research work before iGEM so I was really excited to have the opportunity to help out with the development of the biosensor this year. The best part of this job is that there's a Timmies (Tim Horton's - a coffee and donut store) on the walk here, so I'm full of energy by the time I get to the lab. The summer will be lots of fun, working with great people and learning a lot about science along the way!

Margaret Renaud-Young
I am in the third year of the Biochemistry and Molecular Biology PhD program in the Southern Alberta Cancer Biology Research Group at the University of Calgary.  The focus of my studies is the cellular response to obstructed DNA replication, and how disturbances to this process contribute to genome instability using the budding yeast model system. This is the first year that I have worked with iGEM but I am excited to be part of such an enthusiastic group with a fresh approach to biological study.

David Lloyd
This is my third year being involved in iGEM in which time I have had the opportunity to work with the Alberta team for two years as an undergraduate and now as a team advisor for Calgary. While my Masters focuses on developing new treatments for breast cancer, iGEM and synthetic biology have always been near and dear to my heart. I have many interests including Genetics, Immunology, Cell Biology, Bioinformatics, and Microbiology. In my spare time I can be found playing soccer, volleyball, or squash, as well as playing the piano, listening to music, and video games. In the future, I hope to merge my passions for Biochemistry, Cell Biology, and Synthetic Biology into an exciting career. iGEM has been an amazing opportunity to gain additional skills in a variety of fields and I greatly look forward to another year in the competition!

All work on this project was done by team members of the University of Calgary's 2011 iGEM Team.  Original constructs from which to obtain genes to Biobrick were supplied from Dr. Anthony Schryvers Lab, Dr. Tung's Lab and the Chlamydomonas Database. Pseudomonas strains were provided by Dr. Moore from SFU and by Dr. Lisa Gieg from the University of Calgary. Supervision and direction was provided by faculty members, however all work was done by the team, during the months of May 2011 to present.  No work was done by other labs or individuals not related to the project.

The 2011 iGEM Calgary team would like to thank the following people for helping us throughout our project:
Deirdre Lobb
Our lab tech Deirdre has been invaluable to us. She has been able to help us from providing advice on procedures to helping us pick out a colour scheme. We were very lucky to have Deirdre on hand this summer.
Cobb Lab
We would like to thank the Cobb lab for providing us access to a sonicator and a real time PCR machine. One of our TA's, Maggie, came from the Cobb lab, and we were very glad she was allowed to join our team.
Moorhead Lab
The Moorhead lab provided us with access to their HPLC as well as various reagents. Our second TA, Dave, came from the Moorhead lab, and we were lucky to steal him away from his research this summer.
Gieg Lab
The Gieg lab was extremely helpful this summer. They gave us our first strains of Pseudomonas and instructions on how to grow them. We were also allowed to use their HPLC and analyzing programs as well as their reverse phase C-18 column. A huge thank you to the Gieg lab!
Birss Lab
The Birss lab was extremely helpful with the electrochemical detection side of our project. They managed to answer so many of the questions that we came up with over the summer and were always able to direct us to the best places to learn more. They also allowed us to test some of our methods with their equipment! We wouldn't have been able to get started without them!
Moore Lab
The Moore lab was responsible for publishing one of the main papers we based our project on. They also graciously provided us with the two strains of Pseudomonas that were used in that paper.
Jennifer Hill and Sarah Lee
Jen and Sarah from Alberta Innovates Technology Futures are the reason our team was able to start this summer. From providing funding to putting on the workshops throughout the summer, both of them have been our biggest supporters.
Wendy Hutchins
Wendy was extremely knowledgable and seemed to know an easy solution to every problem we presented her with. She even told us the best places to get reagents!
Dr. Joenel Alcantara
Joenel lent us his experience with microalgae and helped us get that side of our project started.
Jennifer Logan
Jennifer has been an avid supporter of iGEM at the University of Calgary since it started in 2006. She has helped us with things ranging from finding lab space to getting faculty advisors on the team. A big thank you to Jennifer!
Christina Eshaghurshan
Christina was gracious in donating some much needed reagents to us last minute.  Thanks!

The Stress Wars Project was developed by the binational team UNICAMP-EMSE in the Systems Biology Laboratory facilities located in the Center for Molecular Biology and Genetic Engineering (CBMEG) of the Campinas State University (UNICAMP - Brazil). Project members worked as a team and we are proud to have a binational team in which members could bring different and complimentary experiences.
The host laboratory provided most of the infrastructure, equipment and laboratory material needed for the project. Other laboratories located in the CBMEG kindly provided their help when necessary. French advisors and supervisor, although geographically distant, were very helpful in administrative and bureaucratic issues.
Sponsors were indispensable to the accomplished results as they provided most of the laboratory reagents and the synthesized gene sequences used in the biobrick assemblage process.
Brazilian advisors were present in the everyday work, planning experiments and discussing results. Since some students lacked previous ""bench experience"" in routine molecular biology procedures, both advisors and more experienced students accompanied them very closely and tried to help them in this subject. Advisors had some participation in the procedures when necessary, especially in the final steps of the project.
All students, both Brazilian and French ones, were very motivated and for many times worked overnight in order to accomplish the planned objectives. They were very participative in the discussions about the obtained results in the everyday practice. Students also have a fundamental participation in the project idealization and realization, including helping the design of the proposed biobricks and devices, wiki, as well as planning and developing the human practices, for which they deserve the credits.
A especial credit must be given to Iolanda Albuquerque , since it all started with her! She is a Young Ambassador and conceived the idea of participating in iGEM with a binational team. We don't need to say how much it has enriched our experience...
Where we're from
We are a bi-cultural Franco-Brazilian team composed by students and advisors from UNICAMP (State University of Campinas, Brazil) and EMSE (École Nationale Supérieure des Mines de Saint-Étienne, France). We describe below our universities and countries:
Brazilian part of the team - UNICAMP
We are from Unicamp – State University of Campinas, a University was officially founded in October, 1966. The university is located in Campinas, one of the biggest cities of the São Paulo state, whose capital is the most important economic center of Brazil. It was created in response to the state demand of qualified personnel. In spite of being a young institution compared to other foreign universities, Unicamp is already recognized for its tradition in education, research and services to society. Unicamp responsible for 15% of the Brazilian scientific production and is the largest research patents producer in Brazil, producing more patents than institutions like Petrobras and São Paulo University (USP).
Nowadays, the university has  21 centers of teaching and research, in addition to hospital complexes, technical high schools and interdisciplinary centers. As of 2011, the university had more than 36.000 students, about 17,500 undergraduate and 19,000 graduate students, as well as 2,069 faculty members. According to the Times Higher Education 2007 World University Rankings , Unicamp is the 177th best university in the world, and the 2nd best in Latin America (after the University of São Paulo in 176th place).

Attributions & Contributions
We would like to cordially thank all of those who have made our iGEM team successful this year.
To our graduate and post-graduate students, if it was not for your careful guidance and perseverance, we would not have been where we are today. Thank you all very much.
Graduate students:
Sun Young Goo, who instructed us on various lab techniques Ryan Randall, in Eric Gaucher's Lab Samit Watve, a first-year graduate student Douglas White, in Melissa Kemp's Lab
Post-Graduate students:
Lauren Childs, working with both Joshua Weitz's Lab and with the School of Mathematics Megan Cole, in Eric Gaucher's Lab John Patrick Bardill, in Brian Hammer's Lab
Thanks to Eric Gaucher for his supply of materials and lab equipment, without your role as our host lab we would not have been able to perform even half of our experiments. We are also indebted to Ryan Randall, the lab manager, for ordering all of our supplies, sending in our DNA for sequencing, and keeping us performing science.
We would like to also thank Roldolphe Barrangou for supplying active cultures of Streptococcus thermophilus DGCC7710 and an annotated CRISPR/Cas system sequence.
Last, but certainly not least, we would like to thank all of our advisers for their support of our project and perspective on our experiments. They have worked incredibly hard, from listening to our crazy ideas to helping us receive funding. We are infinitely grateful to Dr. Joshua Weitz, Dr. Eric Gaucher, Dr. Brian Hammer, Dr. Mark Styczynski, and Dr. Harold Kim. Thank you very much!

Team:GeorgiaTech/Team
From 2011.igem.org
Advisors
Dr. Eric Gaucher
Dr. Eric Gaucher exploits a multidisciplinary approach towards research to generate an 'evolutionary synthetic biology'. This combination of molecular evolution and biomedicine provides a better understanding of basic molecular processes while simultaneously generating biomolecules useful for industrial and therapeutic purposes. Dr. Gaucher received his Ph.D. in 2001 and then worked for NASA until 2003 studying the Origins and Evolution of Early Life. He was then Researcher/President of a non-profit research organization until 2008 at which time he accepted an Associate Professor position at the Georgia Institute of Technology.
Dr. Brian Hammer
Dr. Brian Hammer is a molecular microbiologist interested a process of chemical communication called Quorum Sensing, which bacteria use to orchestrate group behavior.  He received his MS in aquatic ecology from the University of Michigan in 1995 and his PhD in Microbiology from the University of Michigan Medical School in 2001. He was a National Science Foundation (NSF) Postdoctoral Fellow and Research Scientist at Princeton University from 2001-2008.  Dr. Hammer joined Georgia Tech in 2008 where he is currently an Assistant Professor in the School of Biology.  Dr. Hammer is funded by two programs at the NSF: the Division of the Molecular and Cellular Biosciences (MCB); and the Network Science and Engineering (NetSE) program.
Many of his lab members study the aquatic pathogen Vibrio cholerae, with a focus on the molecular mechanisms that permit this bacterium to convert extracellular chemical signals into changes in the expression of genes important in marine systems and the human host. In addition, other members of the Hammer lab are developing synthetic quorum sensing systems to model, simulate, and experimentally validate the fundamental limits and protocols for molecular communication. This work is in collaboration with several professors in the College of Engineering at Georgia Tech.
Dr. Harold Kim
Dr. Harold Kim is an experimental biophysicist who studies the biophysics of the genome and its influence on gene expression patterns. His research group uses single-molecule and single-cell fluorescence microscopy to understand (1)how intrinsic DNA looping dynamics is related to nucleosome formation; (2) how nucleosome positioning influences gene regulation; and (3) how spatial distribution and copy number of genes influences their expression patterns. Dr. Harold Kim received his PhD in applied physics from Stanford University in 2004, did his postdoctoral research at Harvard University from 2005 to 2009, and joined the School of Physics in 2010 as an assistant professor. He is the recipient of a Burroughs Wellcome Career Award at the Scientific Interface.
Dr. Mark Styczynski
Dr. Mark Styczynski uses experimental and computational techniques to study the connections between the different layers of regulation in cells and the cells' ultimate phenotypic outcomes. Of most interest to his lab are metabolites, the small molecule building blocks necessary for all cellular functions both as source materials and as cues that prompt regulation and other cellular responses. He studies metabolism in a variety of systems ranging from yeast to human cancer cell lines. Dr. Styczynski received his PhD from MIT in 2007, was a postdoctoral associate at the Broad Institute from 2007 to 2009, and joined the School of Chemical & Biomolecular Engineering at Georgia Tech in 2009 as an Assistant Professor.
Dr. Joshua S. Weitz
Dr. Joshua Weitz is a quantitative biologist interested in the structure and dynamics of complex biological systems.  He received his PhD in Physics from MIT in 2003 and was a NSF Postdoctoral Fellow and Associate Research Scholar at Princeton University from 2003-2006.  Dr. Weitz joined Georgia Tech in 2007 where he is currently an Assistant Professor of Biology with courtesy appointments in Physics and Bioengineering.  Dr. Weitz is the recipient of a Burroughs Wellcome Career Award at the Scientific Interface and is funded by the James S. McDonnell Foundation, NSF, and DARPA.  His research group includes ecologists, mathematicians, physicists and bioinformaticians working on four major research themes: (i) viral dynamics at the molecular, population and evolutionary scales; (ii) quantitative systems biology and bioinformatics; (iii) structure and function of vascular networks; (iv) theoretical ecology and epidemiology. The work in the Weitz group is primarily theoretical in nature, and utilizes the tools of nonlinear dynamics, stochastic processes, and large-scale data analysis to interact with experimentalists. Examples of recent and ongoing projects include studies of collective decision making in bacterial viruses, robustness and fragility of gene regulatory networks to copy number variation, unsupervised approaches to binning short environmental sequence fragments, network phenotyping and classification of root system architecture, and a Hierarchical Bayesian analysis of allometric scaling models in biology.

""Ryan manages Prof. Gaucher's laboratory and performs original research as a 2nd year graduate student within the School of Biology at GaTech. She is currently evolving monomeric red fluorescent proteins in the laboratory. Her data will be used to construct an experimental phylogeny that will in turn be used to benchmark computational methods of ancestral sequence reconstruction. She received her BS from the University of Georgia in 2008 with a degree in Cellular Biology. She is the graduate advisor of the Georgia Tech iGEM 2011 team and has been a constant source of support for the team. She has proven invaluable to GTiGEM 2011 team and has provided us with all the lab supplies and protocols.""

Mitesh Agrawal
""""Mitesh is a 3rd year international student from India majoring in Biomedical Engineering. Besides being all around awesome, he was a member of Georgia Tech’s first iGEM team where he was a major contributor to the modeling section of the project. This year he has once again been a vital part of the team, helping with experimental design and giving us perspective on how things worked last year. His research endeavors have included study of embryonic stem cells and genetic engineering. Mitesh was a crew member (radio specialist and biologist) for the Georgia Tech Mars Desert Research Station and  he is also actively involved in the Georgia Alpha chapter of Tau Beta Pi - an engineering honors society.  When not in the lab, Mitesh enjoys playing a rousing game of racquetball and reading science fiction novels. Oh, and he is a die-hard Manchester United fan, so watch out Liverpool. >:)”

Contributions
We would like to cordially thank all of those who have made our iGEM team successful this year. To our graduate and post-graduate students, if it was not for your careful guidance and perseverance, we would not have been where we are today. Thank you all very much.
Graduate students:
Sun Young Goo, who instructed us on various lab techniques
Ryan Randall, in Eric Gaucher's Lab
Samit Watve, a first-year graduate student Douglas White, in Melissa Kemp's Lab
Post-Graduate students:
Lauren Childs, working with both Joshua Weitz's Lab and with the School of Mathematics
Megan Cole, in Eric Gaucher's Lab
John Patrick Bardill, in Brian Hammer's Lab
Thanks to Eric Gaucher for his supply of materials and lab equipment, without your role as our host lab we would not have been able to perform even half of our experiments. We are also indebted to Ryan Randall, the lab manager, for ordering all of our supplies, sending in our DNA for sequencing, and keeping us performing science.
We would like to also thank Roldolphe Barrangou for supplying active cultures of Streptococcus thermophilus DGCC7710 and an annotated CRISPR/Cas system sequence.
Last, but certainly not least, we would like to thank all of our advisers for their support of our project and perspective on our experiments. They have worked incredibly hard, from listening to our crazy ideas to helping us receive funding. We are infinitely grateful to Dr. Joshua Weitz, Dr. Eric Gaucher, Dr. Brian Hammer, Dr. Mark Styczynski, and Dr. Harold Kim. Thank you very much!

Promoters and UTRs
As we began our work with Saccharomyces cerevisiae, it came to our attention that the database is deficient in genes for this organism. This deficiency is due in part to the fact that E. coli genes are widespread through the database, whereas yeast remains a largely untapped area. In order to address this problem and facilitate the use of yeast in synthetic biology we have decided to provide the basic parts required for gene use and assembly. Dr. Jef Boeke has provided some basic parts including promoters and termination sequences of varying strengths. This will allow future teams the ease of use of premade biobricked sequences to use with their genes.
Promoters
Yeast promoter sequences of varying strength have been provided for our work. The following are the available promoters: ARD1p, BAP2p, FCY2p, Gal 1/10p, HHO1p, KRE9p, PRY1p, RPL8Ap, RPL24Ap, RPS2p, RPS8Bp, STM1p, TDH3p
UTRs
Similarly, the following UTRs, or termination sequences have been provided for our work: ARD1utr, BAP2utr, FCY2utr, HHo1utr, KRE9utr, PRY1utr, RPL8Autr, RPL24Autr, RPS2utr, RPS8Butr, STM1utr, TDH3utr

About Us
We are the combined iGEM team of Brown University and Stanford University, working together across three thousand miles and four time zones to develop synthetic biology applications for space exploration.
iGEM, or the International Genetically Engineered Machines Competition, is an annual competition at MIT that aims to advance the field of synthetic biology -- the science of creating machines from biological parts.
Our team is composed of nine undergraduates and recent graduates working under the guidance of post-doctoral students and professors. We are always looking to share our passion for the exciting new field of synthetic biology, so please make sure to contact us with any questions.

This page describes attribution of each member. Attribution was mainly based on the effort and result that a member made during iGEM activities and also considered how regularly a member worked on the part.
Although a lot of members spent effort on not only his/her charge but contributed to other parts as well, in attribution section, only main compartments that a member took charge on were considered.
So, there are limitations exist between actual activities that one made and one uploaded on this page, and therefore we now notice that describing all the detailed contributions that each team member made were difficult job.

Our system is focusing on the biochemical pathway in which glucose is adopted as the starting material and it will end up with some alkane chain of about 14 carbon atoms in length.  As there are many biomass feedstock widely and cheaply available, we can get glucose and yield 14 carbon length alkane easily.  Lignocellulosic biomass is a good example.
This existing strategies is known for ethanol production. In this process, glucose is made during the process as an intermediate. So it can be used as our starting material.  Marine agar biomass can be used as well. Agar consists of a mixture of agarose and agaropectin and agarose is made up of the repeating monomeric unit of agarobiose. Agarobiose is a disaccharide.  Several agarases have been isolated from different genera of bacteria found in seawater, marine sediments and other environments. With the hydrolytic activity of agarase, oligosaccharides are easily available.

K.U.Leuven Team
The 2011 team consists of (bio-) engineers and (biomedical) scientists of the KUL, and – new this year – media developers from the MAD faculty of Genk. Each team member spends his/her summer holiday working on the project. The project was housed at the laboratory of Functional Biology of the Faculty of Science, which kindly provided space for experiments, access to computers and appropriate equipment.
Attributions
If you scroll over the team member pictures, you will see what they mainly did for the project. Most team members actually attributed to different parts in the project than the 'prescribed' role, but you'll only see the 'main role'.
Collaborations
• We sent a plasmid containing the InaZ-gene to the Edinburgh iGEM team.
• We took the initiative to organize a debate and invited the ULB iGEM team to present their project.

We would like to thank Prof. Dr. Gregory Gloor , for providing us with a plasmid (pUC1813ICE) which contains the ice nucleating protein gene inaZ. Prof. Dr. Gregory Gloor currently does research at the University of Western Ontario, examining the vaginal microbiome, since the number and type of bacteria  in the vagina, have a profound effect on a woman's health. An article in which he uses the pUC1813ICE with inaZ can be found here .
We also want to thank Prof. Dr. Filip Rolland . He extracted genomic DNA from the Pseudomonas syringae DC3000 strain . Unfortunately, attempts to clone the INP with this template failed, possibly due to mismatches between the template and primer sequences. In addition, successfull ligation reactions were performed using a protocol optimized in his lab. Prof. Dr. Filip Rolland is a researcher and professor at the K.U. Leuven and works on plantmetabolism and the interaction with fungi. We would like to thank him too for all his effort he put in to our debate as a moderator.
We are also greatful to Prof.Dr.Johan Robben for being a panel member at our debate. He is a professor at the K.U.Leuven and head of the research group Protein Interactions. His current research focuses on DNA polymerases and their potential of incorporating synthetically modified nucleotides. Directed evolution techniques are used for evolving natural polymerases towards new substrate specificities.
Our gratitude also goes to Prof.Dr. Johan De Tavernier for his contributions as a panel member at our debate. He is a professor at the K.U.Leuven.

Our project this year is to design, create, and test a working cadmium water tester. We are going to do this by altering the existing biochemical pathway that Yeast has to recognize the cadmium, and then create our own code that will make it fluoresce red. When we originally had the idea for a water tester, we looked for metals, pesticides, and other harmful substances that are a problem in water supplies. Through much research, we found that cadmium is often a byproduct of many industrial processes, and is often leaked or exposed to the environment. Also, yeast recognizes the presence of cadmium already, so we figured it would be much more simple to alter an existing pathway than to create an entirely new one. We hope through research and experimentation that we are able to make cadmium much more detectable in the environment.

Our Thanks
We would like to acknowledge our generous sponsors, as this project would not have been possible without their financial support. Their contribution shows genuine interest towards the advancement of research efforts. The following is a short overview of each of our sponsors:
Bio-Rad Laboratories have been a major supplier to the life science and pharmaceutical research industries for more than 40 years. The wide range of products they manufacture and distribute have supported high-growth fields especially of genomics and proteomics.
Agilent Technologies is a leader in communications, electronics and life sciences. Their expertise lies in designing and manufacturing electronic and bio-analytical measurement instruments and equipments which are distributed and used globally.
This Centre is within the Department of Chemistry and Biomolecular Sciences at Macquarie University. National and international researchers undertake world-class research in the fields of biotechnology, medical research, proteomics, glycomics, and microbial genomics.
Despite all work being done by the students themselves, the support, guidance and supervision of our instructors Dr Louise Brown and Associate Professor Rob Willows have been pivotal to the success of this project. Dr Louise Brown was the unit co-ordinator who supplied us with lab access and all the materials we needed to perform the experiments. Her advice which stems from years of experience in research labs was critical in the progress of the project from learning to work more efficiently in the lab to thinking innovatively to develop new ideas to overcome obstacles. Associate Professor Rob Willows gave us directions regarding the building of the Bio-Bricks as he has a strong background in molecular biology and has worked with heme and phytochrome related research.
Finally, we would also like to acknowledge the work of Team Macquarie 2010 as the Agrobacterium tumefaciens we used was amplified from their pGemT-easy vector. We also amplified Deinococcus radiodurans from gDNA that they extracted last year. Additionally, the words of advice and experience passed on by Joanna Hare (one of the 2010 team members) was invaluable.

The Team
Supervisors
Anthony Forster
Dr. Forster received from the University of Adelaide, Australia, a B.Sc. majoring in Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry in 1983, a B.Sc. Hons. in Biochemistry in 1984, and a Ph.D. in Biochemistry in 1988. He was a post-doctoral fellow with Nobel laureate Sidney Altman at Yale and received an M.D. magna cum laude from Harvard Medical School in 1996. He then completed a residency in Anatomical Pathology followed by research as an Instructor at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, Harvard Medical School.
He was Assistant Professor in the Department of Pharmacology at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, TN, from 2005-2011 before moving to Uppsala University, Sweden, as a Professor. Dr. Forster discovered the hammerhead catalytic RNA structure, invented photobiotin for the preparation of nucleic acid diagnostics and external guide sequences for ribonuclease P, and has created unnatural genetic codes de novo. He has published in journals including Cell, JACS, Nature, PNAS and Science, edited a volume of Methods, and has authored patents. His technology has founded 3 biotech companies. He currently researches synthetic biology, protein synthesis and drug discovery.
Anders Virtanen
Anders Virtanen is a professor at the Institute of Cell and Molecular Biology and a member of the Uppsala RNA Research Centre (URRC). Anders studies primarily enzymes involved in regulating the fate of mRNA. In his research, experimental systems based on mammalian and Drosophila cells are employed. A main goal is to understand how mRNA turnover/degradation, through the mRNA specific cap and poly(A) tail, is integrated with other essential mechanisms of gene expression/regulation. Another goal is to identify previously unrecognized small non-coding RNAs (ncRNA) and to determine their functions. These studies will be of importance for the general understanding of mechanisms controlling the fate of eukaryotic mRNA.
The two greatest discoveries made by Anders Virtanen are: the first known mRNA polyA-site in a human virus; and the enzyme in the animal cells that removes polyA-tail from mRNA.

Team:Uppsala-Sweden/Team/Human Practice
From 2011.igem.org
Objective
The Human Practice group comprises a few select members of our team. Synthetic biology is an emerging field of discipline within life science. In Sweden, the general public awaits us to spread the knowledge on this new field. Uppsala region has long thrived with companies of biotechnology. It's our task to bring Uppsala to the future of biotech, so our city maintains its role as the hub of life science researches in Sweden. Exhibitions and interactive activities are planned by the Human Practice group. By reaching out to different layers of society and people with different backgrounds, we hope to make the concept ""synthetic biology"" more than just a word for everybody.

Dr. Forster discovered the hammerhead catalytic RNA structure, invented photobiotin for the preparation of nucleic acid diagnostics and external guide sequences for ribonuclease P, and has created unnatural genetic codes de novo. He has published in journals including Cell, JACS, Nature, PNAS and Science, edited a volume of Methods, and has authored patents. His technology has founded 3 biotech companies. He currently researches synthetic biology, protein synthesis and drug discovery.
Anders Virtanen
Anders Virtanen
Anders Virtanen is a professor at the Institute of Cell and Molecular Biology and a member of the Uppsala RNA Research Centre (URRC). Anders studies primarily enzymes involved in regulating the fate of mRNA. In his research, experimental systems based on mammalian and Drosophila cells are employed. A main goal is to understand how mRNA turnover/degradation, through the mRNA specific cap and poly(A) tail, is integrated with other essential mechanisms of gene expression/regulation. Another goal is to identify previously unrecognized small non-coding RNAs (ncRNA) and to determine their functions. These studies will be of importance for the general understanding of mechanisms controlling the fate of eukaryotic mRNA.
The two greatest discoveries made by Anders Virtanen are: the first known mRNA polyA-site in a human virus; and the enzyme in the animal cells that removes polyA-tail from mRNA.

Why i want to participate in iGEM: I’m interested in biology in general but in synthetic biology in particular. iGEM gives me the opportunity to apply my engineer skills on biological system and be creative. Synthetic biology is the playgrounds were you can play with your fantasy no matter how childish it might seem. I like challenges and solving problems using a different approach
As was approaching the end of my first master year. I became very curious how synthetic biology would work in practice and the huge possibilities it can offer. Hence iGEM is the perfect opportunity to get a flavour of this exciting new field and cooperate with fellow students with the same interest.
Interests: I like soccer, meeting new peopled and friends and. I’m also interested in alternative energy/ sources green, economy and entrepreneurship.

The Team
The team came together during the course 'Mammalian Cell Cultivations for Production of Heterologous Proteins' in the month of June. Due to our late team registration we have been working hard all summer to catch up with the other teams. Luckily Mathilde was able to work full time on the project from August and we recruited a fifth team member Maja who joined us in the middle of August. We are five students from the Technical University of Denmark (DTU) all studying biotechnology at graduate level. The project is conducted at the Center for Microbial Biotechnology, where associate professor Mikael Rørdam Andersen is our supervisor together with Post Doc. Helene Faustrup Kildegaard and Ph.D. Dorte Koefoed Holm.

For each PCR product a gel electrophoresis is made to make sure that the PCR product has the correct size.  7-10µl loading buffer is added to each 50µl PCR product and the samples are run in 2% agarose. The Gel electrophoresis were set on 75V for 30-60 minutes (according to the length of the product).
Purification of PCR Product
Materials
GFX PCR DNA and Gel band purification Kit from GE healthcare is used to purify the PCR product after gel electrophoresis.
Preparations
Ethanol is added to the Wash Buffer 1 and the label is marked. Store in airtight container.
Procedures - GE healthcare protocol
Sample Capture
A DNase-free 1,5 ml eppendorf tube is weighed, and the weight is noted.
By using long wavelength (365 nm) ultraviolet light and minimal exposure time, the sample in the gel is visualized. A clean scalpel is used to cut out an the sample from the agarose gel. The agarose gel band is placed into a DNase-free 1,5 ml eppendorf tube and weighed. The weight of the agarose band is calculated.
10 μl Capture buffer type 3 is added for each 10 mg of gel slice. Never use less than 300 μl Capture buffer type 3.
The Capture buffer type 3-sample mix is mixed by inversion and incubated at 60°C for 15–30 minutes until the agarose is completely dissolved. The sample is mixed by inversion every 3 minutes
For each purification a GFX MicroSpin column is placed into a Collection tube.
Sample Binding
The Capture buffer type 3-sample mix is centrifuged briefly to collect the liquid at the bottom of the DNase-free 1,5 ml microcentrifuge tube.
Up to 800 μl Capture buffer type 3- sample mix is transferred to the assembled GFX MicroSpin column.
The sample is incubated at room temperature for 1 minute.
The sample is centrifuged for 30 s at 16 000 × g. The flow-through is discarded.
Repeat the sample binding until all sample is loaded.
Wash and Dry
500 μl Wash buffer type 1 is added to the GFX MicroSpin column.
The sample is centrifuged at 16 000 × g for 30 seconds.
Discard the Collection tube and transfer the GFX MicroSpin column to a new DNase-free 1.5 ml eppendorf tube (supplied by user).
Elution
10–50 μl MilliQ water is added to the center of the membrane in the GFX MicroSpin column placed in a Collection tube. The sample is incubated at room temperature for 1 minute.
The GFX MicroSpin column placed in the Collection tube is centrifuged for 1 minute at 16 000 × g to recover the purified DNA.
The purified DNA is stored at -20°C.

10X Loading Buffer
DNA ladder standard
Electrophoresis chamber
Gel casting tray and combs
Procedures
1.25 g Agarose powder is measured and added to a 500 ml flask
125 ml TAE Buffer is added to the flask.
The agarose is melted in a microwave or hot water bath until the solution becomes clear.
The solution is cooled down to 50-55°C. A trick is to swirl the flask lightly to cool evenly.
20 µl of cybrsafe is added in 4-5 drops on the casting tray. The agarose gel is added and mixed evenly. The gel is left to cure, which takes 30-45 min.
The gel is placed in a electrophoresis chamber. Make sure the TAE buffer in the chamber is 2-3mm above the agarose gel.
The gel is loaded with the samples, a negative sample, and the DNA ladder.
The gel is run at 70V. The time depends on the bp length, but 30-60 min are usually good for 1000-3000bp.
The gel is visualized in a -GEL EXPOSER!-.

Purification of plasmids for fungi
Materials
The GenElute Plasmid Miniprep Kit from Sigma-Aldrich is used to isolate our plasmids to use in fungi. QIAGENs EndoFree Plasmid Maxi kit is used to purify plasmids for use in mammalian cells.
Preparation
The agents are thoroughly mixed. If any reagent forms a precipitate, warm at 55–65 °C until the precipitate dissolves. Cool to room temperature before use.
The solution is resuspended. Spin the tube of the RNase A Solution briefly to collect the solution in the bottom of the tube. Add 13 μl (for 10 prep package), 78 μl (for 70 prep package) or 500 μl (for 350 prep package) of the RNase A Solution to the Resuspension Solution prior to initial use. Store at 4 °C.
Wash solution; Dilute with 95-100% ethanol prior to initial use.
Procedure - according to the manufactures protocol.
Harvest cells by centrifugation of 5 ml of an overnight recombinant E. coli culture. The optimal volume of culture to use depends upon the plasmid and culture density. For best yields, follow the instructions in the note below. Transfer the appropriate volume of the recombinant E. coli culture to a microcentrifuge tube and pellet cells at ≥12,000 3 g for 1 minute. Discard the supernatant.
Completely resuspend the bacterial pellet with 200 μl of the Resuspension Solution. Vortex or pipette up and down to thoroughly resuspend the cells until homogeneous. Incomplete resuspension will result in poor recovery.
Lyse the resuspended cells by adding 200 μl of the Lysis Solution. Immediately mix the contents by gentle inversion (6–8 times) until the mixture becomes clear and viscous. The lyse reaction must not exceed 5 min.
Precipitate the cell debris by adding 350 μl of the Neutralization/Binding Solution. Gently invert the tube 4–6 times. Pellet the cell debris by centrifuging at ≥12,000*3 g or maximum speed for 10 minutes. Cell debris, proteins, lipids, SDS, and chromosomal DNA should fall out of solution as a cloudy, viscous precipitate.
Prepare columns
Insert a GenElute Miniprep Binding Column into a provided microcentrifuge tube, if not already assembled. Add 500 μl of the Column Preparation Solution to each miniprep column and centrifuge at ≥12,000*3 g for 30 seconds to 1 minute. Discard the flow-through liquid.
Transfer the cleared lysate from step 3 to the column prepared in step 4 and centrifuge at ≥12,000*3 g for 30 seconds to 1 minute. Discard the flow-through liquid.
Add 750 μl of the diluted Wash Solution to the column. Centrifuge at ≥12,000*3 g for 30 seconds to 1 minute. The column wash step removes residual salt and other contaminants introduced during the column load. Discard the flow-through liquid and centrifuge again at maximum speed for 1 to 2 minutes without any additional Wash Solution to remove excess ethanol.
Transfer the column to a fresh collection tube. Add 100 μl of MilliQ water to the column. Centrifuge at ≥12,000*3 g for 1 minute.
The DNA is now present in the eluate and is ready for immediate use or storage at –20 °C.

Dilute the starter culture 1/500 to 1/1000 into selective LB medium. For high-copy plasmids inoculate 100 ml medium, and for low-copy plasmids, inoculate 250 ml medium. Grow at 37°C for 12–16 h with vigorous shaking (~300 rpm).
Harvest the bacterial cells by centrifugation at 6000 x g for 15 min at 4°C. Resuspend the bacterial pellet in 10 ml Buffer P1
Add 10 ml Buffer P2, mix gently but thoroughly by inverting 4–6 times, and incubate at room temperature for 5 min. The lysis reaction time must not exceed 5 min.
Add 10 ml chilled Buffer P3 to the lysate, and mix immediately but gently by inverting 4–6 times. Proceed directly to next step. Do not incubate the lysate on ice.
Pour the lysate into the barrel of the QIAfilter Cartridge. Incubate at room temperature for 10 min. Do not insert the plunger!
Remove the cap from the QIAfilter Cartridge outlet nozzle. Gently insert the plunger into the QIAfilter Maxi Cartridge and filter the cell lysate into a 50 ml tube.
Add 2.5 ml Buffer ER to the filtered lysate, mix by inverting the tube approximately 10 times, and incubate on ice for 30 min.
Equilibrate a QIAGEN-tip 500 by applying 10 ml Buffer QBT, and allow the column to empty by gravity flow.
Apply the filtered lysate from step 9 to the QIAGEN-tip and allow it to enter the resin by gravity flow.
Wash the QIAGEN-tip with 2 x 30 ml Buffer QC.
Elute DNA with 15 ml Buffer QN.
Precipitate DNA by adding 10.5 ml (0.7 volumes) room-temperature isopropanol to the eluted DNA. Mix and centrifuge immediately at ≥15,000 x g for 30 min at 4°C. Carefully decant the supernatant.
Wash DNA pellet with 5 ml of endotoxin-free room-temperature 70% ethanol (add 40 ml of 96–100% ethanol to the endotoxin-free water supplied with the kit) and centrifuge at ≥15,000 x g for 10 min. Carefully decant the supernatant without disturbing the pellet.
Air-dry the pellet for 5–10 min, and redissolve the DNA in a suitable volume of endotoxin-free Buffer TE.
To determine the yield, DNA concentration should be determined by both UV spectrophotometry and quantitative analysis on an agarose gel.

The cells are cultivated in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM), supplemented with Penicillin, Streptomycin, and 10 % heat-inactivated foetal calf serum (FCS). Penicillin and Streptomycin are added to prevent any microbial growth. FCS is added to supply essential non-defined components, such as serum proteins and lipids. Supplemented DMEM medium is referred to as complete DMEM throughout the report. The cells are adherent and are kept in 75 cm2 culture flask until 80-100% confluency, where they are passed on to new culture flasks or cover slips.
Cultivation of cells
Materials
25 cm2 culture flask
Complete DMEM
Procedures
Place the appropriate amount of EDTA-trypsin and complete DMEM in the incubator (37°C), before handling the cells (about 1-2 hours before).
The U2OS cells are kept at -80°C until defrosted gently at 37°.
Exactly when defrosted, they are mixed with 12 ml complete DMEM in the pipette.
The cell suspension is transferred to a 15 ml vial and centrifuged at 280 g for 10 minutes. The supernatant is discarded.
The cell pellet is resuspended in 5 ml complete DMEM and transferred to a 25 cm2 culture flask.
The cells are kept at 37°C in a  5% CO2 incubator until the following day, where they are passed on to larger culture flasks.
Passing and maintenance of U2OS cells
Materials
75 cm2 culture flask:
50 ml vial
Complete DMEM medium
0.05 % EDTA-trypsin
Procedure
The appropriate amount of EDTA-trypsin and complete DMEM in the incubator (37°C), before handling the cells.
The filter of a 1 ml pipette is broken off, and the pipette is attached to the vacuum suction maschine. The medium is removed, and the pipette is put in a 50 ml vial for later use.
1 ml 0,05% EDTA-trypsin/PBS is added to wash the cells. Tilt the flask quickly, so the EDTA-trypsin covers the cells. Remove the liquid quickly.
1 ml 0.05% trypsin-EDTA/PBS is added and the flask is incubated for 3 min at 37°C and 5 % CO2.
9 ml complete medium is added to inactivate the EDTA-trypsin and to wash the cells of the surface. Make sure the cells are well resuspended, before you transfer them.
2,5 ml (depends on the concentration of the cells) cell suspension is transferred to a new 75 cm2 culture flask.
The cells are kept at 37°C in a 5% CO2 incubator until they are 80-100% confluent. This takes about 2-3 days. Then they are passed on to a new flask or plate.
Transferring cells to coverslips
Materials
75 cm2 culture flask:
50 ml vial
Complete DMEM medium
0.05 % EDTA-trypsin
6-well plate
Cover slips
Procedure
The filter of a 1 ml pipette is broken off, and the pipette is attached to the vacuum suction maschine. The medium is removed, and the pipette is put in a 50 ml vial for later use.
1,5 ml 0,05% EDTA-trypsin/PBS is added to wash the cells. Tilt the flask quickly, so the EDTA-trypsin covers the cells. Remove the liquid quickly.
1,5 ml 0.05% trypsin-EDTA/PBS is added and the flask is incubated for 3 min at 37°C and 5 % CO2.
9 ml complete medium is added to inactivate the EDTA-trypsin and to wash the cells of the surface. Make sure the cells are well resuspended, before you transfer them.
Calculate the concentration of cells you want in the wells
Cover slips are placed in the bottom of a 6-well plate (2 cover slips/well). 2 ml cell suspension is added gently to each well.
The plate is placed in the incubator at 37°C and 5% CO2 O/N.
Transfection of cells
Materials

MilliQ water
Formaldehyde
lint-free paper
Cover slides
Transparent nail polish
Procedure
A 10X PBS dilution is made from PBS and MilliQ water.
The coverslips are transferred to a 24-well plate (2 coverslip/well).
The coverslips are washed by adding 1 ml diluted PBS to the wells. The PBS is discarded. This is done twice
400 μl Formaldehyde is added to each well under the fume hood, and incubated for 12 min at RT. The liquid is transferred to the waste bin
The coverslips are washed 3 times with the diluted PBS.
The coverslips are dipped in MilliQ water before laid on lint-free paper for drying.
4 drops each of 4 μl Vectashield is placed on a glass slide.
When a coverslip is completely dry, it is placed on a drop of Vectashield on the glass slide. The procedure is repeated for each coverslip.
The coverslips are fixated with transparent nail polish.

The Team
The undergraduate portion of the IGEM 2011 team at UC Davis is currently comprised of four UC Davis students, two of whom are carried over from the team that brought home a Gold at the iGEM Jamboree last year. Candidates for this years iGEM team were selected based on their academic achievement, previous work and laboratory experience, interviews with faculty and responses to a questionnaire about iGEM and synthetic biology.
Keegan Owsley
Major: Biomedical Engineering.
Year: Senior.
iGEM Experience: 2 years.
Specialty: Team leader. Code-guy.
Musical Expertise: None.
Autobiography: Hello! This is my second year being on an iGEM team, and it feels good to be back. We hit the ground running fast this year, and we've gotten a lot done - but the science never stops! Working on iGEM has been an excellent opportunity as an undergrad to participate in self-driven research. As other igemmers probably understand, I spend most of my ""free"" time in lab - but on the off chance I'm not there, you can often find me online, playing Minecraft, surfing reddit, and hanging out with friends!
Tim Fenton
Major: Cell Biology.
Year: Senior.
iGEM Experience: 3 years.
Specialty: Photo-guy. Wiki Designer.
Musical Expertise: 17 years of piano, plays about a dozen other instruments.
Autobiography: Hey there I'm Tim.  I really enjoy doing iGEM because it is one of the best undergrad research opportunities and I love working in the field of synthetic biology.  If I'm not working in lab (almost never) I enjoy cycling on the country roads around Davis and playing tennis.
Aaron Heuckroth
Major: Microbiology, Classics.
Year: Senior.
iGEM Experience: 1 year.
Speciality: Bacteria Geek, Fundraiser/PR Guy.
Musical Expertise: 7 years of electric guitar. Metal, prog-rock, whatever!
Autobiography: I started this summer feeling like the odd man out -- before iGEM, I had no experience with any kind of engineering, and I was the only member of the team not to have taken advanced math courses. My focus on microbiology ended up coming in handy more than once, and I've picked up a lot from my team members, Marc, and the other members of the Facciotti lab, and I plan to explore the field of synthetic biology further in graduate school. If I had free time left over from both majors, I would spend it playing guitar, cooking delicious food and toying around with the occasional video game.
Nick Csicsery
Major: Biological Systems Engineering.
Year: Junior.
iGEM Experience: 1 year.
Speciality: Wetlab Powerhouse, ""The New Guy.""
Musical Expertise: Several years of electric guitar. Classic Rock.
Autobiography: Hi I'm Nick. iGEM this year has been my first lab experience and I have really enjoyed learning how to work in a research lab. I've learned quite a bit about how a project can be taken from an initial idea to a finished product. I've been most amazed by seeing how much a small group of people can get done when they all diligently work together. In my spare time I like long distance running and hiking.

Attributions: What Did We Do?
The short answer? Everything.
Wet Work
Undergraduates from the team performed all wet lab work, from plasmid mini-preps to PCRs to gel extractions.
We filled our own pipette tip boxes, prepared our own TAE buffer and poured our own agarose gels. We even rode our bikes to the laboratory supply center to buy our own 96-well plates for liquid culture analysis.
We based our protocols on existing Facciotti lab procedures and information on OpenWetWare.org .
We revised and improved the mutagenic PCR protocol from this paper to function well with standard BioBrick primers and to produce mutations at a suitable rate for our project.
Data Analysis and Imaging
The information and graphics on our data and project pages comes from analysis performed by undergraduate team members.
Keegan wrote scripts in Octave which were used to parse raw data from our plate reader for mutant screening, promoter activity assays and fluorescence emission scans. Similar scripts were also used to output our 2D and 3D graphs.
He also employed the Flot.js and Three.js libraries to create the 2D and 3D characterization plots seen on the data pages. To do this, he had to code a 3D plotting routine, an interpolation scheme for smooth coloring of 3D surface graphs, and the display widget that is used to present our data.
The mathematical model used to obtain parameters to fit to our data was developed by graduate advisor Linh Huynh . Thanks, Linh!
The Cell Designer graphics on our project selection page were created by Marc Facciotti . Thanks, Marc!
Wiki and Graphic Design
We designed and built this website from the ground up.
The layout was a group effort, with templates designed by Tim. Much of the wiki formatting was removed using CSS code from the 2009 TU Delft iGEM team .
Tim was the primary designing powerhouse behind the wiki and contributed largely to the Notebook section, particularly the gallery. He also implemented the Lightbox 2 code from this site to allow photo viewing from our Flickr account.
Keegan implemented the JQuery javascript library, CSS and HTML code to format our pages, animate the custom menu bar, and enable automatic in-line linking of all instances of BioBrick parts on our site to their corresponding pages on the parts registry .
Aaron wrote and edited much of the copy on the site -- all text was written and edited by undergraduate team members, too.
Nick added the bulk of the Notebook pages and created registry entries for our parts on the registry .
Photographs and Animations
All of the photographs on this site were taken by members of our team.
Tim borrowed a DSLR to take nearly all of the photographs of plates, lab equipment, and lab personnel. Aaron also took some shots with the DSLR, and all team members used the cameras on their phones to document progress and take snapshots.
Tim and Keegan created the 3D animations on the Promoter Families page  by exporting 3D data on protein models from PyMol into Blender and exporting animation frames which were then compiled into .avi files and hosted on Vimeo .
Fundraising
The majority of our fundraising was performed by undergraduate team members.
Aaron raised nearly $10,000 by writing letters to local companies and prominent faculty, and by preparing promotional material like our 2011 Summer Update brochure.
Tim also raised a few thousand dollars from several UC Davis departments.
Open-Source Mindedness
Finding financial support for any iGEM team is a struggle. This year's team had extremely limited funding, and as such we took efforts to limit the cost of our project while keeping our results and protocols accessible to other teams.
We chose software tools that are powerful, open-source and, most importantly, free to use. This doesn't just save us money -- it promotes cooperation between teams regardless of their levels of funding. This is in keeping with the spirit of BioBricks, the Parts Registry , and the iGEM competition.
GIMP
We used Gimp (GNU Image Manipulation Program) for all of our image editing. This program has a majority of the same features as Adobe Photoshop while being free and lightweight. GIMP even has some functions which haven't appeared in its more expensive counterparts!
You can visit the GIMP webiste here .
Blender
Blender is an extremely powerful 3D modeling and animation program.  We did all of our 3D modelling and animation using blender.  All of the protein structures on our wiki were exported from PyMOL into Blender where we animated and rendered them.
You can visit the Blender website here .
Octave
Octave is a language designed for numerical computations similar to MATLAB.  We did all of our data analysis using Octave.  This open-source program made sorting through thousands of lines of fluorescence data quick and easy using some simple scripts.
You can visit the Octave website here .
Inkscape
InkScape is a vector graphics editor. We used it to produce some of the images for this wiki, including our construct diagrams on the Project page.
You can visit the InkScape website here .
