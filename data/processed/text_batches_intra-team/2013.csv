Wetlab
The Dueber Lab hosted iGEM once again this year. We used many of the lab resources including the Golden Gate synthesis automation, Golden Gate parts and connectors, and Golden Gate backbones. The E. Coli promoters we used were cloned into the Golden Gate format by our team. All genes were either PCRed from Dueber Lab DNA templates, or synthesized via gene synthesis. In one instance, a template for the GT oleD came from the Anderson Lab from which we then created our own mutants for in vitro screening.
We used NCBI to locate many homologous GTs to test for activity on indoxyl. Indeed, extensive literature searches through tools such as NCBI and Uniprot allowed us to find the primary enzymes in our pathway, FMO, Glu, and GT. Cloning for both in vivo and in vitro testing was completed in full by our iGEM team. Specific use of analysis machinery such as LC-MS, HPLC, or stereomicroscope was supervised by iGEM team mentor Zach.
Presentation Materials
This Wiki drew inspiration (and basic code) from Berkeley’s 2012 and 2011 teams ( 2011 , and 2012 ). Our logo, Blue Genes, was designed by Leticia Cervantes, sister of fellow team member Bernardo. Unless cited, all other materials were designed by us.

Bernardo Cervantes
Bernardo Cervantes is a final year Bioengineering major enticed by the sheer comfort and joy of being in lab for unspeakable hours. His work revolved around finding many of the  GTs we tested by building cDNA libraries from plants and he has since mastered all flavors of PCR. He was also involved with putting together our presentation. He is perhaps most remembered as the napkin fairy, keeping everyone of us perfectly stocked with paper towels.
Hojae Lee
Hojae Lee is a 3rd year bioengineering major with previous experience working with nanodevices and biomedicine. She decided to pursue iGEM for the immersive experience - which she definitely received. Her wetlab work consisted of manipulating yeast systems for further application of our indigo pathway. Most importantly, Hojae did the most work on our economic and environmental analysis, deciphering the art of chemical process design. Hojae was the mastermind behind this wiki as well as the illustrator expert in our group, and given the location of her bench secluded from the rest of ours, she was best remembered for not always being remembered.
Roy Park
Roy Park began his 2nd year in the Bioengineering major this year. He performed almost all the experiments relating to quantifying our indigo production and also worked on characterizing the kinetic parameters of the enzymes we used in our indigo biosynthesis pathway. He was also quickest to help any of our team whenever we needed help (as long as it didn't involve sonication in the cold room). Though current evidence suggests Roy is a sophomore, he will remain a freshman forever in our hearts.
Ramya Prathuri
Ramya Prathuri is a 4th year bioengineering student known best for her impeccable taste in expensive pipettes. In wetlab, she worked predominantly on isolating and characterizing several of the glucosyl transferases we tested, and she also made our BioBrick parts for the Registry. Ramya played a role in creating our poster, presentation, and most of the written content for our material. She specializes in eating Thai food, throwing used centrifuge tubes into distally located waste bins, and never submitting sequencing on time.
Thomas Rich
Thomas Rich aka 'Sir Thomas' is in his final semester of Bioengineering at Berkeley. He was focused on mutagenizing some of our GTs to expand their substrate specificity and working on potential applications for our indigo biosynthesis pathway in yeast. He designed the introductory slider and did most of the Wiki styling and plugins. Thomas aspires to use his iGEM experience to help him think outside the box in all of life's applications, and eventually, become a high school teacher. Most notably, Thomas' facial hair grows at a most rapid pace, engulfing his face a mere week after shaving.
Mentor: Zach Russ
Zachary Russ is a 3rd year graduate student in the Dueber Lab tasked with guiding our team down the path of science. He helped us define many of our research objectives and troubleshoot many of our assays. In particular, Zach experimented with indigo production in yeast which could broaden the applications for our current biosynthesis pathway. His most prized skills include his ability to pun his way through any conversation and consume vast quantities of tangerine juice.
Mentor: Chris Eiben
Christopher Eiben, another iGEM mentor, is a 2nd year Bioengineering graduate student from the Keasling Lab. His protein engineering experience with FoldIt was extremely useful in helping us better model our GTs and hypothesize Glu activity. When together, Chris and Zach deliver a formidable onslaught of puns that both awe us and make us contemplate dropping out of iGEM.
Advisor: Terry Johnson
Terry has a master's degree in chemical engineering from MIT and is currently teaching bioengineering at UC Berkeley. He hopes that by doing so, he will be giving students the tools that they will need to repair him when he gets older.
Advisor: John Dueber
An Assistant Professor in the Department of Bioengineering at UC Berkeley and a principle investigator of the Energy Biosciences Institute, John is our fearless leader.

The Kent iGEM team of 2013. From left to right: Kara Stubbs , David Hanly , Laura Carman , Sarah Dowie , Michael Coghlan , Rathaven Gunaratnarajah .
Team members:
Laura
I will soon be entering the final year of my Biochemistry degree, but hope to continue in the field to a higher degree qualification. It is my ultimate aim to work within the industry of biotechnology.
Being part of iGEM is both exciting and rewarding, in being able to work within a team on our own project. Whilst discovering more about the area of synthetic biology.
As far as hobbies go, I play both the clarinet and flute and I enjoy reading in my spare time.
Michael
Hey, I'm Michael. I'm studying BSc Biomedical Science whilst being a professor in awesomeness, alongside competing in iGem. It's not easy.
I have a huge interest in synthetic biology, and support the idea of it. ""Do not go where the path may lead, go instead where there is no path and leave a trail"" (Ralph Waldo Emerson). Being at the forefront of synthetic biology is a unique and amazing opportunity, and being a part of such a huge community where everyone has their own ideas is really inspiring, and I'd like to wish everyone the best of luck (and commiserations for when they lose to us)! :)
Sarah
Hey I’m Sarah and I’m a member of iGem team Kent. I’m currently studying Biochemistry and will soon be entering my third year of study. In my free time I enjoy reading comics, running and gaming. Working as part of the iGem team has fuelled my interest in synthetic biology and has helped me to gain much needed experience that can be an advantage for my future career in science.
Rathu
My name is Rathaven Gunaratnarajah and I'm a third year biomedical scientist.
Upon completion of my biomedical science degree, I hope to do a postgraduate degree in medicine and qualify as a doctor.
In my free time I enjoy running, cycling and swimming.
David
Hi, I’m David, and I’ll soon be starting the final year of my biomedical science degree here at Kent. On finishing, I currently hope to either do a masters or go straight to work in industry, ideally in an as yet undecided biomedical field. In my free time, I enjoy going to the gym, watching sports, and spending time with my friends. Also, I’m loving my time working for our university’s first iGEM team. The people I’m working with are great and being part of the worldwide iGEM community really is a unique privilege. I’m amazed generally by the possibilities that synthetic biology holds for our future, and now genuinely hope that I can integrate it at some point with my future career after iGEM.
Kara
Hi I'm Kara Stubbs, I've just finished the second year of my degree (BSc Biochemistry) and I'm moving into the final year with the hope to go on to do an MSc in Bio-engineering or Biochemistry.
I originate from South-West London and now reside in Canterbury.
My hobbies include hiking, gaming (tabletop or pc) and pretending to be a computer programmer hence why I'm the biggest contributor to this wiki.
Instructors:
Dr Mark Shepherd
I am Dr. Mark Shepherd, an instructor for the undergraduate iGEM team from the University of Kent and a Lecturer in Microbial Biochemistry at the School of Biosciences. My research interests include E. coli respiration, disulphide protein folding, oxygen-binding proteins, and the response of bacteria to nitric oxide. Long-term interests in pigment biosynthesis and bacterial physiology/genetics also fuel my enthusiasm for synthetic biology.

What we did.
In our project, we managed to create two novel biobricks containing the NO sensing promoter norV and the other containing the nrfA gene. These parts will form building blocks for potential future projects for testing for the presence of NOx or its conversion to Ammonia. We hope that our project has stimulated interest in alternatives to the current methods of NOx removal from the environment.
Our project is based on the research on norV and the nrfA genes reported in:
Clarke, TA., Mills, PC. et al (2008). Escherichia coli cytochrome c nitrite reductase NItalic textrfA.. Methods in Enzymology. 437: 63-77. * Bush M, Ghosh T, Tucker N, Zhang X, Dixon R: Transcriptional regulation by the dedicated NO sensor, NorR: a route towards NO detoxification; Biochem. Soc. Trans.

Large Phage May - June Notebook: Experiments
Overview
March-April
May-June
July-August
September-October
UV Selection Test
I) Purpose
The purpose of this experiment is to subject small samples of phage to varying doses of UV light. This experiment is thought to work by selecting against phage with only one copy of each gene. When critical genes are knocked out of these phage, the phage cannot replicate themselves. Phage with multiple genomes (and thus, larger capsids) are much more resistant to UV light because they have multiple copies of each gene.
II) Expected Outcome
We predict that phage more resistant to mutation and UV light will be the ones that will survive the irradiation the best.
III) Materials
Liquid high-titer phage lysate
Parafilm
Overnight culture of E. coli
UV light (we used the UV light inside a BSL-2 hood)
IV) Methods
1. Under the hood, divide a piece of paraflim into sections, labeling each section with a time for how long that sample will be subjected to UV light. (We usually do 1 minute increments)
2. Place 20 uL from the phage stock on each section of parafilm.
3. Start the UV light for the incremental time amount. When the time is up, turn the light off.
4. Remove 10 uL from the first section and place it in 0.5 mL of E. coli in a test tube.
5. Start the UV light again, and repeat steps 3-5.
6. Plate out all infected E. coli samples in LB top agar.
V) Results

Amber Brown
Amber is not the typical lab junkie that you would imagine.  Rather than spending a lot of time indoors, she loves getting out! Between all of her hiking, rafting, and slacklining she manages to squeeze in several hours research time in the lab for the BYU iGEM team.  Amber one day hopes to become a professor of microbiology, a good fit for someone who is so dedicated to her work.  Amber has enjoyed the research opportunities offered by iGEM and found it to be a valuable experience!
Arick Christopher
Despite Arick’s creepy looking picture right here, he is actually a pretty cool cat.  Growing up a redneck in Redding, California, he somehow joined the hipster phase when he moved to Medford, Oregon.  While he is not studying exercise science, he is busy rafting, hiking, or playing Dungeons and Dragons.  He aspires to one day become an oral surgeon and is apparently quite the cook (according to his girlfriend...).
Clarice Harrison
Clarice lives a life torn between the two loves of her life: Russia and molecular biology. Self proclaimed 'gene junkie' and русская сестра, she finally achieved a merger of these two worlds when she spent a month at the University of Moscow on a biotechnology internship. After that she didn't know what to do with her life. So of course she is going to apply for grad school.  In her spare time she enjoys sleeping with her purple pillows, purple blanket, and copy of Eugene Onegin.
Kendall Kiser
Kendall Kiser is homozygous negative for the “get-PCR-right-the-first-time” gene.  Labmates marvel that he was ever admitted to an institution of higher learning.  He insists that he’s “like, way smart” and “if PCR were baseball, I’d go 1 for 20 and still make a million bucks, so there.” He sticks his tongue out like he’s three.  This childishness is to blame for the entire children’s book text.
By other descriptions, he’s a Spanish-speakin’, piano-playin’ soccer-strikin’ neuroscience nerd.  Kendall’s left-handed talent for calligraphy is legendary, and entirely useless in an age of word processing software.
Darren Lasko
Darren Lasko is from Reno, Nevada. He is majoring in Microbiology and wants to go to Medical School, because he thinks it's cool. Darren is always the person in the lab who picks up the slack and gets the job done. When everything goes wrong, he'll lighten the mood. Darren also enjoys watching the Bachelorette, and is a real ladies man!
Xiuqi (Jade) Li
There are only three parts to Jade's schedule: in the lab, on her way to the lab, or thinking about the lab. What can you say? She is a total lab junkie. Between iGEM and a Cancer Research Fellowship, Jade spent more time in the lab than outside it this summer. Being cooped up all day in a small room that most students are not aware of its existence, Jade is disappointed that she missed her chance of absorbing as much Vitamin D as possible during the best part of the year. But at least she got to make something ""explode"" safely in a biology lab (see picture on the right).
Jade challenges everyone to guess what she is holding in the picture. If you can get it right in one try, she will offer you a piece of the famous BYU mint truffles!
Bryan Merrill
Bryan is a bacteriophage aficionado.  In addition to his phage research in iGEM, he works as a TA for the Phage Hunters class at BYU and does phage genomics research on the side. He is convinced that ""phage"" and ""phun"" begin with the same two letters.
Outside of the lab and school, you'll find him training for a half-marathon, tending his honey bees, gardening, and trying to impress his amazing wife. In a rare moment of free time, he is most likely watching a good movie, playing (or writing) music, or visiting family, or watching BYU sports. (Go Cougars!)
Kelton Peck
This biography is written in loving memory of Kelton Peck, whose remains were discovered one dreary morning on the top floor of the Widsoe lab building. Rigor mortis had eternally fixed his clutch around a pipet as he was loading his last gel. While living, Kelton loved playing the violin and ukulele, tearing up the soccer field, exploring the great outdoors, and spending time with a good book. Before his untimely death ended all worldly aspirations, he had hoped to pursue a career in specialized pharmacy and pharmaceutical research.
Lindsey Perry
LJ (which stands for Lindsey Jackson Perry IV) is from Laguna Hills, California. He is a junior and studying Microbiology. LJ wishes that there was more time in the week as it's filled with iGEM lab, 17.5 credit hours worth of classes, all the homework that comes with them, a chemistry lab TA job, and volunteering at the hospital and a local hospice program. He is doing all these things in preparation for applying to Medical School next spring. In his rare free time, LJ likes to play hockey, go hiking, or practice the guitar.
Nathan Robert Sabin
Nathan always likes to have a good time. Before coming to BYU and joining the iGEM team, his only experience with bio-engineering came from learning about Mewtwo in Pokemon: The Movie. Needless to say, he has come a long way. Nathan is a sophomore microbiology student, but more accurately a rough, tough, farmbody from deep in the heart of Texas. Despite growing up on a farm, he never learned how to milk a cow. After three more years at BYU Nathan has plans to do the cool thing and go to medical school.
Michael Schellhous
Not your typical southern California guy, Michael has never been surfing. However, he has seen several movies that involve surfing, so we're pretty sure he'd be an expert if he ever tried. When declaring his major, he couldn't decide between chemistry and biology, so he made the only logical choice and chose biochemistry. This happened to turn out to be his real passion and he has a special interest in proteomics and lipidomics. He loves reading, racquetball, and just about anything outside.
Keltzie Westra
Keltzie Westra is a Senior majoring in Medical Laboratory Science from Sacramento, California. When she's not in the lab she enjoys traveling and spending time with her family. Some of her favorite things to do are nap, eat lots of candy and vacation. While she is thrilled to be a newlywed, she is still having a hard time remembering her last name after getting married last July!

5.3 T7 Phage Selection Method Test
I) Purpose
Test the size of plaques formed from x6 and x8 top agar
II) Expected outcome
As top agar increase in concentration, the number of plaques/plate should decrease and individual plaques should become smaller.
III) Reagent record
T7 + phage: -5 dilution from 4.26; E coli BL21; Agar: ×2 prepared by Jordan in 500mL glass bottle; LB: prepared by us on 4.3; overnight bacteria culture: set up on Thursday at 2:00pm using 4.6 streak; ×8 top agar stock: prepared by us on 4.3
IV) Actual procedures / observations
i) Six test tubes were labeled control, ×6, ×6, ×8, ×8, x8, and ×8. To each of the test tubes, 0.5mL of E coli overnight liquid culture was added.
ii) To each test tube 20 μL of -5 phage solution was added. This mixture of E coli and phage was left sitting for 20 minutes before proceeding.
iii) In a separate set of test tubes, top agar was diluted to give ×6, and ×8 concentration.
iv) 5mL of top agar was added to each test tube so that the concentration of the agar added matches the labels on test tube. For the control tube, ×8 agar was added. The contents of these test tubes were then plated on LB plates. Note: ×6 and ×8 solidified as soon as the content hit the plate. As a result, top agar wasn’t spread evenly.
v) After the top agar has solidified, the plates were incubated up side down
V) Results
The x8 plates had smaller and few plaques than the x6 plates
The x8 plaques are about 1mm in diameter

5.6 T7+ Liquid Culture Phage Concentration Test
I) Purpose
To determine if the volume of phage stock added effects the liquid culture concentration result
II) Expected Outcome
We hope that 100uL of phage will be enough to increase the liquid culture concentration
III) Reagants Used
E. Coli BL21 overnight from 5.5; T7+ from 5.3 T7 phage amplification/purification ; LB from 4.5
IV) Actual Procedure
Liquid culture set up (5.6)
- Three test tubes were set up. To each, add 4mL of LB and 1mL of E coli BL21 overnight
- Add 10uL, 100uL, and 1mL to each tube, respectively.
- Liquid culture was incubated for approximately 48 hours (5.6 4:00pm - 5.8 6:00pm)
Spot test to test amplification results (5.8)
- Phage liquid culture was purified and spot test was performed using procedures similar to those in 5.3 T7 phage amplification/purification
- The purified stock was labeled 5.6
- Spot test plates were incubated overnight
V) Results (5.9)
- The 10 ul spot test went down to -9, 100 ul to -8, and 1 ml to -7
- Thus, 10 ul yields the highest titer

5.3 Phage Amplification/Purification
I) Purpose
To create a higher titer of phage solution
II) Expected Outcome
A purified high titer of phage
III) Reagent Record
Chloroform from Dr. Grose’s lab. Liquid cultures prepared on 4.27
IV) Actual Procedure/Observations
Set up phage liquid culture (4.27)
+ phage: 4mL LB + 1mL E coli + 100μL phage stock (0, original received)
- phage: 4mL LB + 1mL E coli
Liquid culture purification
1) Put 1mL of liquid culture into 4 eppendorf tubes
2) Centrifuge at 3000 rpm for 5 minutes
3) Transfer supernatant into 4 new eppendorf tubes
4) Add 100 uL of chloroform to each of the new tubes and gently shake
5) We labeled the purified stock 5.3
Spot test (5.5)
1) Create a 1:10 dilution series from 0 to -11 of liquid culture that was purified above
2) Put 1mL of E.Coli in a 50mL centrifuge tube
3) Add 5mL LB with 5mL of x2 top agar to the 50mL centrifuge tobe
4) Plate 5mL of top agar solution in centrifuge tube onto 2 plates
5) Spot 5uL of each dilution onto the two plates, 6 on each. The labels on the plates should correspond to dilution series number
6) Incubate overnight at 37 C
V) Results
From spot test, we know that our phage amplification procedure worked somewhat. We were able to increase phage titer to approximately -7 or -8.
VI) Proposed next step
We’ll use this stock to further concentrate phage. Testing whether the amount of phage added to liquid culture will affect phage titering result will be helpful.

5.5 Amplification from a plaque test
I) Purpose
Test the procedure for creating phage liquid culture from a single plaque on a plate
II) Expected Outcome
In spot test, we should see plaques until the phage dilution series became too diluted.
III) Reagants Used
E. Coli BL21 overnight from 5.4; ×6 plate from 5.3 T7 phage selection method test ; LB from 4.3
IV) Actual Procedure
1. Amplifying phage from a single plaque (5.5)
To a test tube, add 1mL of E coli BL21 overnight (5.4) and 4mL of LB
Stab one of the plaques on a ×6 plate from the 5.3 T7 phage selection method test with a 1mL pipet tip, puncturing the agar. The plaque in question is labeled with a circle.
The pipet tip is then dipped into the overnight/LB solution. The solution is then pipetted up and down several times to maximize the amount of phage that gets into the solution.
The solution was then incubated for approximately 24 hours (5.5 noon - 5.6 2:00pm )
2. Spot test to test amplification results (5.6)
Phage liquid culture was purified and spot test was performed using procedures similar to those in 5.3 T7 phage amplification/purification . Stock created was labeled 5.4
Spot test plates were incubated overnight (5.6 4:00pm - 5.7 12:00pm )
V) Results (5.7)
Our method of amplification from a single plaque was successful. Phage plaque was observed up to -7

The Great Team
Our project is totally an undergraduate project. All the works in our group are done by undergraduate, starting from brainstorming the idea, wet work on the bench, lab troubleshooting, constructing wiki as well as sponsors and donors hunting, It has been a long project but it is totally rewarding. We have fun and learn a lot of things. All of team members have increase the lab work skills, journal reading skills as well as negotiating skills.
Team Description:
Supervisors
Dr. dr. Budiman Bela, Sp.MK (K)
Head of Clinical Microbiology laboratory at Faculty of Medicine, Universitas Indonesia.
Drs. Abinawanto, M.Si
Head of Genetics laboratory at Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences, Universitas Indonesia.
Students
Muhammad Hanifi (Medicine, ’11)
The leader of the group. Sing along to each and every song on the radio while we’re working in the lab. Even though sometimes he does not know the lyrics. Or the melody. Or both.
Achmad Danny Gazali (Biology, ’10)
The movie maker. Records and takes pics of our activities. Has the Yao Ming-meme-face when laughing.
Dwiantari Satyapertiwi (Chemical Engineering, ’11)
The maker of this page.The other members don’t know what I’m writing, so, the information provided here may or may not be accurate ;)
Mohamad Teguh Gumelar (Bioprocess Technology, ’11)
The naïve one. Constantly got tricked by the other members. Takes lots, yes, LOTS of selfies.
Putu Ayuwidia Ekaputri (Medicine, ’10)
The random Sanguine. Takes bus alone to her birthplace (approximately 3 hours from her current address), on her birthday, just to take picture of herself in front of the hospital she was born in. And it’s unplanned.
Rahdi Dewin Marzaini (Medicine, ’11)
The linguist. Or maybe language maniac. Knows maybe 10 languages apart from his mother tongue. Found his soulmate in High School, who is no other than...Achmad Danny Gazali.
Taufik Hidayat Abdullah (Bioprocess Technology, ’11)
The web designer. Also the main personnel in the lab. The one who has the best “bench-flip” expression.
Wisnu Tafroji (Biology, ’10)
The one who is worried about ripping more than two pairs of gloves everytime he enters the lab.

From 2013.igem.org
©Xiamen , also known as Amoy,is a major city on the southeast (Taiwan Strait) coast of the People's Republic of China. It is administered as a sub-provincial city of Fujian province with an area of 1,699.39 square kilometres (656.14 sq mi) and population of 3.67 million. Its built up area is now bigger than the old urban island area and covers all six districts of Xiamen (Huli, Siming, Jimei, Tong'an, Haicang and recently Xiang'an). It borders Quanzhou to the north and Zhangzhou making this a unique built up area of more than five million people. The Jinmen (Kinmen) Islands administered by the Republic of China (Taiwan) are less than 10 kilometres (6.2 mi) away. Xiamen and the surrounding southern Fujian countryside are the ancestral home to large communities of overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia and Taiwan. The city was a treaty port in the 19th century and one of the four original Special Economic Zones opened to foreign investment and trade when China began economic reforms in the early 1980s. It is endowed with educational and cultural institutions supported by the overseas Chinese diaspora. In 2006, Xiamen was ranked as China's second ""most suitable city for living"",as well as China's ""most romantic leisure city"" in 2011.

Our Team
XMU-China 2013
Our team consists of 11 undergraduates, 3 advisers and 3 instructors. We come from different faculties, including Chemistry, Chemical engineering, and Bioengineering, but we all belong to the College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering. There is not only strength in numbers, but also creativity. We brainstormed every single idea from circuit construction to name cards in this inspiring project along with joy and laughter.
We want to express gratitude to our beloved Prof. Grace I-Son Ng, who not only offered us her lab, but also gave us a lot of useful suggestions and encouragement throughout this project. When we had the first crisis she told us that joining iGEM is like hiking, as the altitude is getting higher, the harder it would be. However, the view would be better. Now we are trying our outmost to top the iGEM mountain and have a look at the synthetic biology world. We also appreciate Prof. Chaoyong James Yang's generous help when we had some problems in building our microfluidic devices. Furthermore, we shall extend our deepest thanks to Prof.Baishan Fang, the first organizer of XMU-China.

Our University
Xiamen University
Xiamen University was founded in 1921 by Tan Kah Kee, the well-known patriotic overseas Chinese leader. Over the past ninety years, as the result of following the school motto: Pursue Excellence, Strive for Perfection, Xiamen University has accumulated rich experience in offering its educational programs and has presented its distinctive features in running the programs. The main campus of XMU locates in a picturesque setting between the sea and a scenic mountain, spreading over 150 hectares, and is generally regarded as the most beautiful campus in China. See more
Our City
Xiamen
Xiamen is a coastal city located in the southeast coast of China popularly known as the Garden on the Sea. An early poet once described the city in this way: ""A city leans on stones like a flower; millions of mountains embrace the sea"", which was a true portrayal of the scenery of Garden on the Sea. There are many good reasons to visit Xiamen: With good food, some great architecture and a mild to hot climate, Xiamen is hard to beat. See more

Collaborations
Jamboré
Our team participated in the first event that promoted the meeting of the Brazilian teams, which was hosted by the USP team(University of São Paulo). This historic event (and very funny one) was called Jamboré. All the teams members were able to play the card game created as a human practices by the USP team, know themselves and the projects better, join a discussion about the difficulties of the competition and the solutions that each team has found (with the sponsorship, for example) and collaborate with suggestions.
Purdue´s standard protocol
We collaborated with the survey done by the Purdue´s team about the development of a standard protocol. They are developing a list of protocols and assays that need to be completed in order to submit the part to the registry. For us it seems like a great idea and we hope that our collaboration has helped this project.

Xiong Le
It is my honour to be the group leader of HZAU-2013iGEM team. My major is biotechnology. The first question I start to concern is the famous question “what is life”. I hope I will have a good understanding of this question. Synthetic biology may play an important role in solving this big question. I am also interested in physics. I want to know the framework of the world. The best motto for me is that Sky, earth and human beings are three kind of genius. (in Chinese天地人乃三才) it reflects the confidence of our human beings.

Zhang Shaowei
Several months ago, I even know nothing about the IGEM, but now, in a few days, we will go for Hong Kong and take part in it. Our team worked the whole vacation to make our design come true and I believe we can make it. In our team, I am mainly responsible for the experiment. Sometimes, it seems to be very easy to do the experiment, but it really doesn’t like what it seem to be. I have to say we have been though a tough vacation. However ,at the same time ,we all learned a lot.
Zou Xianlin
Looking at me, be careful that I will fascinate you! Aha, well, in real earnest, I’m just pursuing something from my soul in life sciences and technology college of HZAU! Enormously glorious for me to pay my passion on the biology field. There is nothing quite like spending my last remaining dollar on the project I believe in, so just do it without any concern.Best wishes for my team, and of course for you!
If you have any provoking thought, I think maybe we can have an exchange. It's my E-mail that 760103003@qq.com

Luo Xudong
Hello, I'm a student of bioinformatics. I deal with data everyday and you can call me data excavator. I search data in a variety of literature all day. However, my hobbies are very much, like different kinds of sports, cycling, dancing, photography, tourism and so on. I like to do some challenging things, maybe it's crazy, but I enjoy it very much. So, if you want to do some crazy things, call me.
Tian Liu
major in informatics,college of life science and technology
It is an accident for me to take part in the iGEM competition. The first time I heard the iGEM is in May at this year. I knew nothing about synthetic biology but felt it interesting when I searched it on internet. So I decided to join the team with knowing nothing at all. Gradually, I found the competition is filled with fun. We fight for a common goal and enjoy it.
I am a travel fan and like to seek the world on my bike. I took this photo at the ancient city wall in JingZhou. The biology is also a old subject but the longer the new. It leads me to find the world and enjoy the beauty, so does my bike. After touching with the synthetic biology and the iGEM, I found we have the chance to change the world. Wait for the collision of ideas in the Jamboree.

Ding Linfeng
Hi,I am Ding Linfeng,major in bioinformatics,college of life science and technology. My favorite subject is computer.So,I become a technical designer of our team wiki.I have learned a little before about how to make a simple web.It is aslo difficult to make a beautiful and useful web.I learn many new things about it.It is a great choice for student to know what they can do and find more friends from all over the world!
Liu Chang
Hi, I'm Changchang, the art designer of our team wiki. I’m a sophomore in life sciences and technology college of HZAU. What I do in the team is what I’m skilled in, because a big part of my spare time is contributed to design works; I’m before an art editor working for our student magazine. This is the first time I create designs for websites, I feel kind of new, and our group learned a lot in the webpage design. As you can see the cute carton figures showed in this wiki, that’s my favorite achievement!
Zhang Peijing
major in bioinformatics,college of life science and technology
Hi,I am Zhang Peijing,the technical designer of our team wiki. Though I am learning to use wiki for only two months, after this period of time, I knew something about it. All the codes in our wiki are my hard working. Besides wiki, I also train the experimental operation. Joining IGEM is an extremely right choice,I learn a lot in it and open an international perspective, which is a challenge and an unusual experience for me. I hope I could participate in it next year.

Collaboration between North Carolina A&T and The University of Texas at Austin
UT Austin and NCA&T Geneious Tutorials
NC A&T and UT-Austin are part of BEACON, an NSF center that studies evolution. We teamed up in order to combine the principles of synthetic biology and evolution in our projects, and to lay the foundation for an independent NC A&T iGEM team for next year's competition.
In June, four team members from UT-Austin visted NC A&T for a week to present a series of molecular biology workshops. Each day’s workshop would start with a “dry-lab” component such as generating project ideas, experimental design, and computational tools for synthetic biology. This was followed by a “wet-lab” application, such as transformation, PCR, and cloning. In July, five members of the NC A&T team visited Austin for another series of workshops. These activities focused on how the Austin team applied the techniques covered earlier for the MAPs and p-cresol degradation projects. More advanced techniques were demonstrated, such as advanced primer design for plasmid assembly, and the use of non-canonical amino acids for protein engineering.

Regulating protein activity is important throughout science. In fundamental science you need to regulate the activity of the protein of intrest to investigate its function. In Synthetic Biology versatile regulating protein activity allows one to control the function of any constructed system. But eversince it is complicated to regulate protein activity with a good spatiotemporal resolution. Within our project we aim to engineer a system that enables everyone to easily control the activity of any protein of choice just with light.

Although METU has been participating in iGEM for 6 years now, iGEM never caught the attention it deserved, mainly because of the technical roots of our school and the fascinating engineering clubs and their projects.
 
It was time for this trend to change.
Click on topics and pictures to see detailed information.
High school meetings
We do not restrict ourselves into METU or other teams. We want to share iGEM logic to younger people who lives in immediate surroundings. The best way of this is putting iGEM across young minds of high school students. So, we visited the high schools around us.
 
 
MEV High School and Umitkoy Anatolian High School
We went there and gave a seminar about iGEM competiton. Our main aim is sharing the logic behind the iGEM. Therefore, we basically tell the iGEM competition with project examples of not only college but also high school teams.Also, we tried to encourage them to set up a high school teams but were not that succesful, even though students are thrilled, mostly the administration of schools and teachers were sorry to decline due to lack of funds. A shame really...
 
 
Having the advantage of being located on our schools campus, we were thrilled when biology teachers from the OGV high school invited us to present ourselves to the kids.With this new gained fame we explained the general logic behind iGEM and told the kids about many of the projects including ours. After they took the bait, we infected the kids with the highschool division of iGEM :). The kids must have liked the idea because after the beginning of school an iGEM Student Club was formed by their Science and Technology teacher.
DNA day seminar
The Biology and Genetics Student Club (Biyogen) and our team joined forces to celebrate this special day! So we celebrated the DNA day with scientist candidates from OGV High school. In this seminar, we explained the structure and importance of DNA,  its history and recent applications related to the DNA based on synthetic biology and iGEM. This seminar helped them to improve the solutions to general problems via using synthetic biology. As we dwindled in areas not covered in high school level biology, the kids excitement arose. I don’t think that they will underestimate biology or DNA ever again :D.
Demo Experiments
 
The DNA day and our previous presentations must have been a great success because we were contacted again by the biology teacher of the OGV high school. This time, the kids wanted to see a lab, how things work in a lab and generally the Biological Sciences Building. So, we cleaned up the lab, gathered materials and showed the kids the bright side of a laboratory (no need to crush them with the dark sides right?)
OGV High school division help
 
We already mentioned the newly formed iGEM Student Club in OGV, so we were again summoned, this time to be more specific about iGEM. So we explained in more detail what iGEM was about and how it was done. As the kids and their teacher showed increased interest in joining iGEM we set up schedules for the therotical training of the kids. We are now trying to teach to the kids how a scientific paper should be read. I must add that the Brainstorming sessions of such young minds is pretty fascinating. We are still aiding these kids, to lectures never end.
Synbio and Children
We work as the scientific division of Guven Foundation which helps the children in social and scientific areas. We work as a bridge between synthetic biology and children. The children we are talking about had pretty hard conditions in life. We tried to influence the children by introducing them to science, especially biology and with that influence give them the courage and maybe a goal to accomplish. Seeing the faces of the kids after you explain even basic biology or let them play with colored solutions makes you believe in the motto change the World one child at a time .

Hello everyone;
I’m Selin. I am graduated from METU Biology department this year and I will become a master student in METU Biology department. I am part of the METU 2013 Team because I really enjoyed in METU iGEM 2012 team. This year, being a part of the team means different than previous year because I have more responsibility as team leader. I believe every good and valuable thing is not gathered easily. This motto and our team give me power not only making good things which based on synthetic biology but also running the team :) I am really proud of a member of this wonderful and mischievous team :)
 
Hi, I am Batuhan Elcin and i am a junior student in the department of biology,and its my first year in the iGem competition. I am also a huge fan of Sci-Fi literature. Participating in iGem project makes me feel like a mad scientist in those stories. But they call me the tech-guy in laboratory referring to my knack for machines. For further questions message directly to me via steam/linoinsenger.
 
Hi, I am Alisan Kayabölen. I graduated from Molecular Biology and Genetics department. It is my second year at master study in Biomedical Engineering, METU. I was in iGEM team of METU last year, and before that team I couldn’t do anything at “genetics” side of my own department. I studied on stem cells and tissue engineering fields during my internship and special project course. So, iGEM was a huge chance for me to study genetics and learn many techniques about synthetic biology. My dream is to be able to combine tissue engineering and synthetic biology fields. I have worked mainly in theoretical planning of project and at wet lab part. And, I also tried to find sponsors for our project, but it is difficult to say that I was very successful.
Hey! I’m Bilge, a soon to be sophomore in Molecular Biology and Genetics Department of METU. Though participating iGEM was not that hard for me, I wanted to contribute to science and I wanted to do it with my friends, but understanding and learning all the things was not easy at all. Yet, here I am, trying to do my best for our project. I always loved the idea of working in a lab but what I didn’t know was that I would fall in love with it. iGEM taught me lots of things, what I want to do in future, what I don’t want to do in future, what it takes being a part of a wonderful team and dedicating yourself to something and that you have to learn new things every day if it is an area like ours- recently developing and just a small part of it is discovered. But the most important thing iGEM taught me is that there are no boundaries when it comes to science. If your imagination is wide enough nothing is impossible!
Ahoy, my fellow iGEMers.
Me name be Özgün Kırdar, a sophomore student at METU Biology. This is my second year in iGEM and I really happy to join this again. We learn so much about synthetic biology and iGEM at last year, and this year we use this experience for not to repeat our same mistakes and hopefully gain a gold medal. This year I help my team at Funding(Again, ahh!), Project Design, Wet Lab and Human Practice( I’m a movie star, Arr!).
Synthetic Biology is what I want to study and thank you iGEM for helping me to realize that and giving me a really good opportunity.
See ye later.
 
 
Hello everyone;
I am Aykal Refik Aşkın and I will be a junior student in the Department of Statistics in METU. I am one of the non-biologist student in METU iGEM 2013. This is my first iGEM experience and I am very excited. Thanks to Gürkan I met iGEM. I am a member of the modelling part. I think iGEM will develop me. I learn taking responsibility and teamwork. I am very happy to being this wonderful team.
 
 
Hi,
I’m Oğuz, it is my second year in iGEM now. Long story short, I love synthetic biology! I love being in a lab, I love presenting a new area and fascinating people while I explain what I do in my free time. Let’s be honest, iGEM is (!) the most time consuming and energy draining thing on Earth. But and that but is important, the feeling of accomplishing something is so fulfilling, iGEM work and the Jamboree’s are so much fun that you cannot let it go anymore.
 
See you all again next year folks, until then lets have a blast of a time in both the lab work and during the jamboree!
 
 
Hi, I am Aysegul Dede.
I am a third year student at Biology Department of METU. I am the newest member of the team , i am generally called as ‘Hey intern’. Although I joined the team afterwards, all members gave me a huge hug and they encouraged me to catch up their knowledge level. I joined the team since I’ve always wanted to solve both environmental and humanity problems via biology. Thanks to IGEM, I have lab experiences which help me not only in my courses but also will help me in my future studies. IGEM helps me to fulfill my dreams.
Hi !
I’m Mehmet Nizamoğlu from METU iGEM 2013 Team, second year Molecular Biology and Genetics student at METU. Although it was hard to decide to take part in this competition team and it took hours to be convinced, right now I’m in almost every part in our team: Human Practice, Wet-Lab, Funding and whatever left. I’m in because iGEM is a perfect opportunity to take responsibility and expand your knowledge by yourself. While working on this project, you are nearly on your own, nobody to ask, nobody to blame and nobody to save you. You learn to learn, so your friends can ask you, you learn to take responsibility, so you friends can blame you and you learn to act without a command, so you can save time and what needs to be saved. That is the soul for iGEM, and I believe I have it – so here I am.
Hello people! =^o t o^=
I’m Uğurcan SAKIZLI and they call me “ghu” which is my nickname on the internet. I am a sophomore in Biology Department of METU and I was –fortunately- dragged into the iGEM team by İlkem. So, this is my first iGEM experience. I believe what I learn here will become useful in my future education and life. I like working in the wet lab but I’m mainly participating in the modeling team. Yarışmacı arkadaşlara başarılar diliyorum.
Hi, I am a senior in the department of Molecular Biology and Genetics in Middle East Technical University. I have also a minor program in Logic and Philosophy of Science in the department of Philosophy. This is my second year in IGEM. I learned lots of things that i could not even imagine last year and. I expect nothing less from this year. We are more experienced now and we have many talented newcomers this year. This competition is a great opportunity to understand synthetic biology as a discipline and and funniest way to doing science.
Hi I am Gürkan Akan, a third year student in Statistics Department in METU. This year is my first iGEM experience and I think I will be in next iGEM teams of METU. I met IGEM very spotaneously and I really loved the idea. Modifyng some creature for your own purposes, it sounds like the bad guys in animes. Sadly, this year I could only contributed the modelling part of it but I hope on the next championships I will be able to help the wet lab too. This project need too much effort and it makes our team like our family and I am very happy to being with my team.
I' m Hakan TAŞKIRAN, a third year student at  the Molecular Biology and Genetics Department in METU. This is my first year in iGEM and at the beginning I wanted to contribute my team in the lab work but now I' m the designer, scenarist, director, and party organizer of our team. I do not complain about my job because I think it is the best part of the iGEM competition. I see iGEM as a tool to reach the people who don't know what science really is and how fun it can be. Also, iGEM gives us an opportunity to do eco-friendly science and make our earth a little bit better place to live. with my team what they did and want to do i hope people will understand the purpose of science and scientist and they will be more open to science and become more aware about our environment.
Hello dear iGEMers,
 it's Ilkem Kumru here. I am a sophomore student in Biology Department of Middle East Technical University. This is my first year in iGEM. I take part in Wet Lab, Human Practice, Modeling and everything else. I always wanted to be even a small piece of biological sciences from my childhood. I am extremely happy to take place in METU iGEM team, where everyone works with enthusiasm and excitement to discover new frontiers. A biology laboratory where we work iGEM is the place where I can live and work till death, and it is also the only place where I feel myself as immortal as my love of science.
Hello everyone!
I’m Irmak a freshman from Environmental Engineering in METU. Also I’m working on granule sludge in microbiology laboratory as an assistant in my department . This is my first year in iGEM team as a wetlab worker and as a director of the videos for our human practice works and also researcher for improving projects. Although I’m studying engineer , I’ve always been interested in biology and last year I've heard about the synthetic biology which is very interesting for me. So, I’m here  and so happy to be here. Dealing with the serious problems in the world, and trying to solve them, learning new things every single day and applying them into academic life by leading our wise seniors... This is how we are in our team, and this is what I want to do in my life always.
 
 
Greetings; I’m Emre and I will be a junior student in the Department of Biology. This is my second year in this competition. I mostly work on the wet-lab but I help my friends in most fields as far as in me lain. In my first year, I gain a lot of experience both in theory and in practice. This time my prior aim is share these experiences with my new teammates since iGEM marathon is exhausting and we need fresh blood during the lab session and when the deadline comes closer. I love working on synthetic biology since iGEM gave me this opportunity and I love being a part of iGEM.
Heyy ; I am Burak KIZIL , a first year student at Biology Department in METU.Mostly the name of competition attracts me, to be participated in İnternational action , combining the concepts of Genetic and the Engineering and creating the Machine.I am really happy to be part of İGEM, since its like surviving in the endless field by the guide of team spirit and devotions. à bientôt en France..
I am Buse Isbilir , a forth year student in Molecular Biology and Genetics Department in METU and also in Computer Engineering minor program. This year is my second iGEM experience and I think I will be in next iGEM teams of METU. I am happy to be a part of iGEM, because in this competition you are the captain of your ship. My crew and I worked a lot for the modelling and wiki. This sense of freedom is just our thing.
Hi! I am Muge from Molecular Biology and Genetics Department at METU. This is my first year in METU iGEM Team. I am a member of this team because I like working in the lab, making something with our own study. As METU iGEM Team 2013 we’re all working hard for the project and the other things and also we have great friendships with all the nervous things in the lab. I am really happy to be part of this team.
Hi, I'm Samet Albayrak, a senior student at Molecular Biology and Genetics department in METU. Being in iGEM team requires huge amount of dedication and lots of hard work. But in the end I hope it will pay off. I always wanted to make a difference and change something in the world. With the almost endless energy I have, if used properly, I think I can do that. I also love working in lab. I even love my lab coat, thinking about giving a name to it :) And here's iGEM, the best and the most fun opportunity to do everything i want I've ever came across.
Hi everyone!
I’m Şeniz Yüksel and that is my first year in METU iGEM Team. I’m studying Biology at the Middle East Technical University. I am having my first iGEM experiences and I can say that I really enjoy the work during our project. The best part I like to spend time is the work in the lab. In iGEM I can find an opportunity to develop our ideas and to be a part of science. Through the processes we are doing I learned a lot of things and now I have a greater vision of synthetic biology. I think iGEM is a perfect way to improve my knowledge. We are all working and giving our best for our project. I enjoy being a part of iGEM.
Hi everyone.
My name is Begüm Ece Tohumcu, a freshmen student in Biology. I’m part of the this year’s METU iGEM Team and this is my first year at iGEM competition. I’m really excited about it. I join the team because I want to get new experiences about biology and this team is really great way for me to learn about synthetic biology. Working at real-time lab is really teaching me, a freshmen student a lot. I am also an eco-girl, and doing a project about saving the environment is just what I want to do. I help to team at lab works and human practice (I’m the Queen Bee, Yey!). I’m really looking forward to come to the Lyon for competition. See you soon.

Our Project Description:
   Taking a major role in pollination, bees are one of the most important organisms within an ecosystem. However their populations are in serious decline. Colony Collapse Disorder has been found as the most common cause of the disappearance of bees in large numbers. Some pathogens like parasitic fungi and a pesticide called imidacloprid are the leading reasons of CCD. In this study, our aim is to decrease the number of hives affected by chemical compounds such as imidacloprid.
 
          Our plan is to turn the mutualistic bacteria living in bees' guts into a shield mechanism to protect the bees against these factors. A protein CYP6G1 found in Drosophilia melanogaster has the ability to degrade imidacloprid into harmless substances. Moreover, coumaric acid increases the general immunity of bees against harmful components and parasitic organisms and we aim to increase the level of coumaric acid in bees' guts. The main objective of this study is the transformation of the genes coding for these two proteins to Bacillus subtilis, which mutualistically live in bees' guts.

My research interests are diverse, but may be placed into two large bins. First, at Concordia Computational Intelligence Lab (CCIL) we research and develop solutions to problems in Artificial Intelligence & Evolutionary Computing as well as Pattern Classification & Image Processing. More specifically, we use tools including well-established methods from Machine Learning and Genetic Algorithms to solve problems of written pattern classification and biomedical image segmentation. Our work has resulted in new methods for multiple ellipse detection in images, as well as new means of scheduling tasks on heterogeneous multi-processor machines.

My research interests fall into two main axes. First, our laboratory is investigating biochemical and molecular aspects of the sulfonation reaction in relation to plant growth, development and adaptation to stress using Arabidopsis thaliana sulfotransferases as a model system. To date, we have characterized two sulfotransferases involved in the sulfation of brassinosteroids and hydroxylated derivatives of jasmonic acid, respectively. The biochemical function and the pattern of expression of these enzymes suggest that plants like mammals use the sulfonation reaction to modulate the biological activity of hormones and chemical messengers. Our second axis of research is the study of the structure function relationship of sulfotransferases in order to elucidate the mechanism of sulfonate transfer and to define the amino acids responsible for substrate binding and catalysis. Using site-directed mutagenesis of the flavonol 3-sulfotransferase, we mapped several amino acids required for catalysis and cosubstrate binding while the construction of chimeric proteins allowed to define the domain responsible for substrate specificity.

Brainstorming and Research
All 8 undergraduates, as well as advisors Aaron Lewis, Spencer Katz, and Natalie Ma, participated in the formation of the idea for this project, and the research required to design and carry out this project.
Lab Work
Three undergraduates - Timothy Baker, Andrew Crouch, and Joel Sher - performed the lab work over the summer, as well as Kevin Zhou for the first few weeks. Natalie Ma, Adrian Haimovich, Alexis Rovner, Edward Barbieri, Ryan Gallagher, Jaymin Patel, and Miriam Amiram all provided assistance in the form of instruction of numerous new techniques and guidance on how to proceed, with Natalie Ma being our point person. Dr. Farren Isaacs, Dr. Stephen Dellaporta, Aaron Lewis, and Spencer Katz, along with Natalie Ma, provided invaluable feedback and guidance. Dr. Kenneth Nelson trained and assisted us in the use of the FACS machine.
Modeling
Kevin Zhou, with the help of Adrian Haimovich, carried out all the modeling we needed to know which parts of the E. coli metabolism we needed to target.
Wiki Design
This wiki was co-designed by Edward Kong and Andrew Crouch.
Funding and Resources
Ming Chen handled all of the team's expenses, while Amy Mulholland helped us with our purchases. All of our sponsors, listed below, provided either direct funding or helped through other means, e.g. discounts on products or services, free samples, presentation feedback, etc. Yale West Campus gave us a lab space to work in, and the Isaacs lab gave us access to their materials and strains, most notably the E. coli EcNR2 strain designed for multiplex automated genome engineering.

As a research assistant at the Hussman institute of Human Genomics at UM, I conduct research on the effects of cocaine use on genomic methylation in the brain as well as bacterial engineering experiments. I am happy to have the opportunity to be part of the 2013 UCSF iGEM team. When not in lab, I enjoy training in Gracie Jiu Jitsu and boxing.
Felicity Jika
Hey! My name is Felicity Jika, and I have been interested in science for as long as I can remember. I am a recent graduate of Abraham Lincoln High School in San Francisco and will be attending San Francisco State University in the fall. I was born in Nigeria and came to America when I was four years old. I am interested in foreign drama shows and reading books about magic, which, to me, is science that can’t be explained.
Derrick Lee
Hi, I’m Derrick! I recently graduated from Abraham Lincoln High School in San Francisco and plan to attend City College of San Francisco with the intention of transferring to UC-Davis in two years. So far my goal is to major in Molecular Biology and possibly pursue a PhD. In my off time, I enjoy playing games, watching movies, and eating.
Sherry Teng
My name is Sherry Teng.  My favorite color is red. I’m entering UCLA as a freshman this fall and I plan to major in Molecular Cell and Developmental Biology.  In my free time, I like to watch stand up comedy and exercise my own sense of humor.
Eric Wong
Hello, my name is Eric Wong. I’m a 2013 graduate of Abraham Lincoln High School in San Francisco. I’m attending the College of San Mateo and am interested in transferring to UC-Davis after two years. I intend to major in Molecular Biology with some sort of minor in business. For me, iGEM is a chance to dive straight into hands-on, innovative research. It’s a pleasure to be a part of this enormous community where we all work together to discover and create things we never imagined or thought possible.  Outside of iGEM, I read leisurely and surf the web to my heart’s content.

Verna Huang
Hi, my name is Verna Huang. I've loved science since 6th grade, and I hope to expand my interest in science through iGEM. This is my second year in the iGEM competition as part of the UCSF team. When I’m not geeking out over synthetic biology, I like to read fiction of any kind, draw my surroundings, and swim. I am currently a second year student at UC-Santa Barbara, possibly majoring in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology.
JI Weiyue
My name is JI Weiyue and I’m a senior undergraduate from Peking University majoring in Life Sciences. Impressed by the marvelous biological phenomena and the ways scientists may accurately control and freely engineer living systems, I joined the 2011 Peking iGEM team and have been working in the field of synthetic biology ever since. This summer at UCSF, I have had the great opportunity to improve my scientific skills and develop new connections. In my leisure time, I enjoy reading various kinds of books and playing the piano.
Kendall Kearns
Hi there! My name is Kendall Kearns. I love food, sleep, the color blue, music, art, and hanging out with friends and family. In my free time, I enjoy watching movies, reading, Olympic-style weightlifting or working out, and cooking! I've always loved science, probably since I started watching “The Magic School Bus” every morning in elementary and middle school. I'm currently attending UC-Irvine, possibly majoring in Microbiology and Immunology. I might also want to minor in something else, but I'm not sure yet! This is my second year competing with the UCSF iGEM team.

Susan Chen
Hello! My name is Susan and I am a third year at UCSF in the Tetrad program. I grew up in the east bay area and stayed around to study biochemistry and bioengineering at UC Berkeley (Go Bears!). During my time at Cal, I discovered academic research, more specifically synthetic biology, and became very interested in harvesting the power of biology for useful applications. Spurred by that interest, I joined the 2009 Berkeley iGEM team to work on bacterial surface display, and from there I became inspired to one day TA iGEM, contributing to this rich experience for students and just getting plain old excited for novel synthetic biology research.
Ben Heineike
Ben is assisting the IGEM team with computational tools.  He is a PhD student in Bioinformatics, and a member of the UCSF center for Systems and Synthetic Biology. He grew up in Kings Beach, Ca and graduated from North Tahoe High School, and afterwards attended the US Naval Academy, where he studied mathematics.  He also holds an MSc in Applied and Computational Mathematics from the University of Oxford.  He spent several years as a Surface Wafare Officer in the US Navy including a tour as a mathematics instructor at the Naval Academy.
Graham Heimberg
I'm Graham, a third year Bioinformatics PhD student here at UCSF.  After doing iGEM as an undergrad at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign... twice, I figured I wasn't quite done yet.  So now I help with the computational aspects of the team's project.  I think iGEM is a pretty cool opportunity. Here at UCSF where we have a team mainly comprised of high school students and it's particularly exciting for this to be their first exposure to hands on, technical science.
Greg Fedewa
Greg is a third year Bioinformatics student at UCSF. He went to Michigan State University for undergrad and studied Biochemistry & Molecular Biology.  While there he worked in a plant biochemistry lab.  After undergrad, he worked for a few years researching plant genetics.  He also helped with the iGEM Jamboree in 2009.  This year he is helping mostly with wet lab experiments and analysis.
Anusuya Ramasubramanian
Anusuya is a third year Bioengineering Ph.D. student in the UCSF/UC Berkeley joint program, where she works at the nexus of tissue engineering, biomaterials and synthetic biology.  She has an undergraduate degree in Biomechanical Engineering from Stanford University.  Having participated in iGEM twice as an undergrad at Stanford - once as team member and once as a mentor - she couldn't help but get involved with iGEM as a graduate student.  Mentoring the UCSF team, which has a unique mix of high school and undergraduate members, has been an enriching and rewarding experience.   Anusuya has been really impressed with the progress of this year's team and can't wait to see the impact of their work at the Jamboree and beyond!
Thomas Stevens
Thomas is a graduate student in Biophysics at UCSF. He worked on the iGEM team at Washington University in St. Louis in 2009, optimizing light harvesting in the photosynthetic bacterium R. sphaeroides. He is enjoying revisiting iGEM in his first mentorship role, helping students collect and analyze gene expression data.
Matt Rubashkin
Matt is assisting the iGEM team with microscopy tools and synthetic biology backround. Matt graduated from Johns Hopkins University in May 2010, receiving a B.S. in Biomedical Engineering. At JHU, he participated in Dr. Jef Boeke's Build-A-Genome project, synthesizing a functional designer eukaryotic chromosome. Currently, Matt is a PhD student in the joint UCSF/UCB program in Bioengineering. He investigates the role of epithelial cell dimensionality and membrane protein dynamics in the context of cancer invasion and metastasis. Matt is excited to teach the next generation of bioengineers and synthetic biologists through iGEM at UCSF!

Dominik Becker
Hi, my name is Dominik.
Who I am you ask? I’m the guy who is always a little loud, a little bit grumpy, a little bit over the top. The only thing I am not is little. Although my friends call me a little prick sometimes, they know they can always rely on me for help or make them smile after a long day in the lab.
If you want to look me up at any iGEM event, look out for the tall redhead with the cigarette.
Munter!
Team: Reporter Team
Jan Gundlach
When I was a child, I always wanted to keep track of everything happening around me and also to keep everything organized. I guess that this hasn’t changed since then, so I “earned” the nickname Sheriff. Even though I try to control these, sometimes annoying, characteristics, they manage to burst out from time to time.
Anyway, if you still want to find me at any iGEM event, you can also look out for a quite tall guy, but in contrast to Dominik I’m not redheaded and I won’t have a cigarette on me.
Team: Array Team , Organization Team
Nina Heckmann
I live in Göttingen since the start of my Bachelor studies and did my Bachelor thesis at the European Neuroscience Institute Göttingen. At their department of developmental neurobiology I worked on the identification of somatosensory-neuron-specific enhancers. Right know I study the DNB (Developmental, Neural and Behavioral Biology) - Master. I would like to focus on cancer research or other human diseases like Multiplies sclerosis.
iGEM is a great project where we start our own laboratory work and besides we can learn things like self organization and responsibility for our project. Our topic of antibiotic resistances is a serious problem. Finding ways to tackle it is worthwhile the work.

Sören Rindfleisch
Hey folks,
My name is Sören and the fact that I needed to write this little text more than four month might describe me quite well. I`m studying also ""Microbiology and Biochemistry"" and as you might see, endless days of cloning, trying and mistaking have manifested on the top of my head. And doubtless, the thousand cloning attempts during iGem didn't make it better. Nevertheless, success was worth it I guess.
Cheers Sören

Well, there is not much to say: I did my Bachelor studies in Biology in Göttingen, my Bachelor thesis was in Genetics. After a single Master semester in Biochemistry in Düsseldorf, I went “ruefully” back to Göttingen. Now, I’m studying “Microbiology & Biochemistry”. My scientific interests range from everything to nothing in particular: All types of eukaryotes or prokaryotes. Their evolution, ecology, physiology and molecular biology. Even non-living stuff like Physics and Chemistry is fine. The reason why I’m participating in our iGEM team? - Sounds like fun.

Organization Team
In order to get the iGEM project of Team Göttingen 2013 started, an organization team was formed in the beginning of this year. First of all, our main task was to find a proper topic. After endless discussions and brain storming sessions, we saw light appearing at the end of the tunnel. On closer examination, the light turned out to be Green Coli which can be used as an Antibiotic Detector to fight against multi-resistant bacteria. To arm for the battle we found a base at the Department of Microbiology. Furthermore, we designed a booklet by which we managed to attract several sponsors for our mission. In the end we managed to set up everything before the entire iGEM Team could start working.

We were interested in identifying novel c-di-AMP regulatory elements that control gene expression in Bacillus subtilis. In collaboration with the iGEM Groningen Team, we performed global target analysis.
Our goal was to look for genes, whose expression level is affected by the level of c-di-AMP. Therefore we compared the transcriptomes of the wild-type B. subtilis strain and a mutant strain, which produces a lot of c-di-AMP (Fig. 1).
By doing so, we are able to (i) find other pathways that respond to c-di-AMP and therefore can be used to construct a reporter system, and (ii) we can shed light on the signaling network of c-di-AMP in B. subtilis.
Fig.1: c-di-AMP concentrations determined via liquid chromatography-coupled tandem mass spectrometry method by our collaboration partner from the Hannover Medical School. In blue the c-di-AMP amount in low phosphate medium is shown, in red the c-di-AMP amount in high phosphate medium. We compared the wildtype and a hyperactive strain (1344) of Bacillus.
The microarray analysis in Groningen gave us a first glimpse on all the genes, which are affected by the c-di-AMP level. We were especially interested in ydaO. From a poster of another workgroup we knew that ydaO is connected to an upstream c-di-AMP sensing riboswitch. This means that in the presence of c-di-AMP the riboswitch will assemble and prohibit the expression of ydaO. Without c-di-AMP the riboswitch cannot be established and ydaO will be expressed. Therefore, ydaO was a perfect candidate for us to build another reporter around it. As the microarray analysis revealed, the expression of ydaO was indeed affected by c-di-AMP levels. To further analyze these results, we did some qRT-PCR analysis back in Göttingen (Fig. 2).
Fig.2: qRT-PCR analysis of c-di-AMP affected ydaO and a of control gene. The analysis revealed that in comparison to the wild type ydaO is upregulated with low c-di-AMP levels.
Our qRT-PCR analysis showed that ydaO is upregulated with low c-di-AMP levels. This means that the expression of ydaO is supposedly linked to the c-di-AMP levels inside the cell.

Introduction
In order to facilitate the development of new antibiotics, we want to build an “Antibiotic Detector” that can identify substances, affecting homeostasis of cyclic-di-AMP (c-di-AMP). c-di-AMP is a signal nucleotide that is essential for viability of many Gram-positive bacteria. It is not found in humans as well as in Gram-negative bacteria, including E. coli. For more information see Our Project overview .
For constructing a c-di-AMP detector, we need elements that are capable of sensing c-di-AMP! Moreover, in order to visualize the output of the sensors, we need a reporter.
DarR reporter system ( part BBa_K1045017 ):
Recently, in Mycobacterium smegmatis, the transcriptional repressor DarR was identified and shown to respond to c-di-AMP. It can bind to a specific DNA sequence, called the DarR operator. DNA-binding activity of DarR is strongly enhanced by c-di-AMP. Since DarR is a c-di-AMP sensor, we intended to use it for our reporter system. We cloned the DNA sequence, encoding DarR into pSB1C3 ( BBa_K1045001 ). In addition to this, we constructed the DarR operator as a Biobrick ( BBa_K1045000 ). We placed the DarR operator between a strong promoter ( BBa_J23110 ) and the GFP generator BBa_E0240 . In the very same plasmid but oriented in the opposite direction, we assembled a darR expression unit. Synthesis of DarR is driven by a weak promoter based on BBa_J23117 and terminated by BBa_K1045009 . This terminator is based on BBa_B0015 , which is part of BBa_E0240 , as well, and should ensure that transcription of darR and gfp does not influence each other. The ribosome-binding site (RBS) BBa_K1045010 (derived from BBa_B0034 ) was used as an RBS for translation of the darR mRNA. Assembly of all those parts (Fig. 1.1) required a complex cloning process which finally resulted in part BBa_K1045017 , the DarR reporter system (Fig. 1.2). E. coli was then transformed with this construct to obtain an in vivo screening system that interfere with c-di-AMP-binding to a c-di-AMP target.
Ideally, this c-di-AMP-sensing system works in the following way (Fig. 1.3): Without c-di-AMP, DarR is not bound to the DarR operator, so GFP is expressed resulting in green fluorescing cells. With c-di-AMP, DarR can bind to its binding sequence, repressing gfp transcription, leading to non-fluorescent cells. In the same way, the system might react to compounds similar to c-di-AMP. It can therefore be used to screen for compounds similar to c-di-AMP. It can be used in a high-throughput scale, as well. This way, the DarR reporter system will make it possible to find inhibitors and competitors which might be used as antibiotics.
Fig. 1.1. The DarR reporter system was assembled step by step in pSB1C3. If a certain biobrick of a specific cloning step was used as a vector, insert or derived from hybridization oligos or PCR is indicated in blue. The part numbers of the intermediates are given in black. The orientation of the arrows corresponds to the orientation of the element in the vector.
Figure 1.2: The final DarR reporter system consisted of two expression units in diverging orientation.
Figure 1.3: Without c-di-AMP, E. coli cells expressing the DarR reporter system will emit a green fluorescence signal. With c-di-AMP the will not fluoresce.

Riboswitch reporter system ( part BBa_K1045002 ):
The ydaO gene from B. subtilis is regulated by c-di-AMP. This control is mediated by a c-di-AMP-binding riboswitch, according to data of a publication that appeared this month (Nelson et al., 2013). Structurally, a riboswitch is a RNA-sequence. Functionally, it is a simple switch. It has two mutually exclusive states: ON and OFF. Depending on the circumstances, it can only be in one of the states. The ydaO-riboswitch is dependent on c-di-AMP; whenever it is present, the riboswitch will be turned OFF, meaning that the gene controlled by it cannot be read.
The ydaO riboswitch was, in addition to DarR, a perfect fit as a c-di-AMP sensor for our antibiotic detector. Hence, we constructed an alternative reporter system.
Since it was unclear where the exact beginning and ending of the ydaO promoter, the ydaO riboswitch and the ydaO RBS were, we created four different constructs (Fig. 2.; BBa_K1045004 , BBa_K1045005 , BBa_K1045006 , BBa_K1045007 ). The sequence of BBa_K1045004 was cloned in front of the reporter gene CFP ( BBa_E0020 ). For the termination of transcription, we exploited the terminator on pSB1C3. In principle, the riboswitch reporter system might respond in exactly the same way to c-di-AMP, as the DarR reporter system does: Without c-di-AMP, E. coli cells harboring BBa_K1045002 will fluoresce blue. In contrast, when c-di-AMP is present, the ydaO riboswitch will terminate transcription of cfp leading to non-fluorescent cells (Fig. 2.2). This way, we can scan substances which can act on the riboswitch as c-di-AMP does. This might lead to the identification of competitors or inhibitors for future antibiotics, as well.
Figure 2.1. The riboswitch reporter system is composed of the ydaO riboswitch and cfp as a reporter gene.
Figure 2.2. In theory, E. coli cells transformed with the riboswitch reporter system will fluoresce blue when c-di-AMP is absent. When c-di-AMP is present, however, the ydaO riboswitch will prevent expression of CFP.

Results
The DarR Reporter System
To test the DarR reporter system, E. coli cells were transformed with the DarR reporter system ( BBa_K1045017 ) (Fig. 3, right image) or with a control plasmid containing the GFP expression unit only ( BBa_K1045013 ) (Fig. 3, left image). Both strains were grown without c-di-AMP and subjected to fluorescence microscopy. While the control strain showed green fluorescing cells, the cells of the DarR reporter system strain barely fluoresced, indicating that DarR acts as a strong repressor in E. coli.
Figure 3: To test the DarR reporter system, fluorescence microscopy of E. coli transformed with a control plasmid (left) and E.coli cells harboring the DarR reporter system (right) was done. Both images are merges of GFP channel and bright field.
The Riboswitch Reporter System
For testing the riboswitch reporter system, E.coli was transformed with BBa_K1045002 and grown either with c-di-AMP or without. The cells were analyzed by fluorescence microscopy. A strong fluorescence for both strains could be observed, indicating that the reporter construct is highly expressed from the B. subtilis promoter. However, an influence of c-di-AMP was not seen.
Figure 4: E. coli cells containing the riboswitch reporter system were grown without (left) or with (right) c-di-AMP and studied under the fluorescence microscope.
Discussion
Since we are in urgent need for novel antibiotics, we constructed two different c-di-AMP reporter systems which would allow the screening for compounds affecting c-di-AMP biofunction. One system was based on the c-di-AMP-binding transcriptional repressor DarR. In our system, DarR controlled the expression of the reporter gene GFP. E. coli cells transformed with a vector harboring the DarR reporter system exhibited no green fluorescence compared to cells transformed with a control plasmid lacking the DarR expression unit. This data indicated that DarR seems to be expressed and active as a repressor in E. coli. Even in the absence of c-di-AMP, DarR was likely to bind the DarR operator strongly and repressed GFP expression almost completely. Under these conditions, an intermediate GFP expression level would be more suitable for our purpose to screen for novel antibiotics. Such an intermediate expression level of GFP in the absence of c-di-AMP might be reached in two ways: For instance, one could try a promoter for DarR even weaker than the current one. A more successful approach might be directed mutagenesis of the DarR operator to reduce the binding affinity of DarR to this DNA sequence.
Regarding the alternative reporter system involving the c-di-AMP-responsive ydaO riboswitch, optimization is needed, as well. The results obtained from fluorescence microscopy showed that the riboswitch reporter construct is expressed in E. coli though the native Bacillus promoter and Bacillus RBS were employed. Hence, E. coli seems to be able to use these elements. The strong CFP fluorescence of the E. coli cells even suggests a strong promoter activity. The high transcript levels that might be caused by this strong promoter could account for the observed ineffectiveness of exogenously applied c-di-AMP: There might be more riboswitch than c-di-AMP to bind to. Consequently, one could try to increase the c-di-AMP amounts. Alternatively, one could fuse the riboswitch biobrick BBa_K1045005 to a weaker promoter to reduce the mRNA levels. Another possibility might be to switch to low-copy plasmids for expression of the reporter system. If despite reduced transcript levels, c-di-AMP has no effect on the riboswitch reporter system, E. coli might be unable to take up c-di-AMP. Yet, this would not put an end to the construction of a screening system for antibiotics targeting c-di-AMP. It has been reported, that B. subtilis is able to take up c-di-AMP (Oppenheimer-Shaaman et al., 2011). Thus, one could put more effort in unraveling the ways by which B. subtilis and other bacteria take up c-di-AMP. This knowledge might allow the engineering of E. coli regarding c-di-AMP uptake. In parallel to this time-consuming approach, one could try to synthesize c-di-AMP in vivo by expressing diadenylate cyclases in E. coli cells containing an optimized c-di-AMP reporter system. Using DACs of different activity, the output of the reporter system could be characterized. Finally, having a well characterized c-di-AMP reporter system combined with a DAC, it is possible to screen in vivo for antibiotics interfering not only with the function of the essential signaling nucleotide c-di-AMP, but also for its essential biosynthesis enzyme, the DAC.

Introduction
In order to find a novel target that can be inhibited by new antibacterial compounds, we focused on the recently discovered signaling molecule bis-(3’,5’)-cyclic dimeric adenosine monophosphate (c-di-AMP). c-di-AMP was shown to be an essential second messenger in many important pathogenic Gram-positive bacteria (Witte et al., 2008). Moreover, c-di-AMP has a crucial function in cell wall synthesis and spore formation in Bacillus subtilis (Oppenheimer-Shaanan et al., 2011; Mehne et al., 2013). Interestingly, both lack and excess of c-di-AMP have detrimental effects on cell growth and morphology (Luo and Helmann, 2012; Mehne et al., 2013).
Based on these observations, it makes sense that we take a closer look at the enzyme, the diadenylate cyclase (DAC), which produces c-di-AMP. The DAC CdaA is conserved among several Gram-positive bacteria like B. subtilis, and in the important pathogenic bacteria Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus and Listeria monocytogenes (Corrigan and Gründling, 2013). So far, the DAC DisA from B. subtilis has been purified and crystallized (Witte et al., 2008). However, this protein is not present in all Gram-positive bacteria as well as in many pathogenic bacteria. Therefore we decided to concentrate on the DAC CdaA from L. monocytogenes, which is - as mentioned above - well-conserved in all bacteria that need c-di-AMP for growth!
Results and Discussion
Unfortunately, cloning of the full-length gene, encoding the membrane-bound DAC, DacA (Lmo2120) using Escherichia coli failed. Therefore, we decided to clone a truncated dacA gene, that encodes a DAC enzyme, lacking the trans-membrane domain. In this protein the first 100 amino acids are missing. Nevertheless, the resulting truncated part still included the essential DAC domain, and therefore represents one of our favorite BioBricks: BBa_K1045003 !
By conducting several experiments, we proved that the truncated DacA protein (BBa_K1045003) was not only active in vivo, but also did it's job in vitro. Moreover, we were able to purify the DAC domain in large scale for determining its 3D structure! Using the structure data, one can now search for chemical compounds that interfere with the activity of the cyclase either by testing with available chemical libraries or by computational modeling. In the following text, the experiments will be explained in more detail.  However, if you wish to get even more details, please visit the Parts Registry or our LabBook.
The truncated DacA protein ( BBa_K1045003 ) was extended with an N-terminal Step-tag allowing the rapid purification using the Strep-tag:Streptactin purification system. Synthesis of our protein is driven by a T7 promoter. This promoter is recognized by the T7 polymerase, which is encoded in the genome of the E. coli strain BL21. Synthesis of the T7 polymerase can be controlled by Isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG). The generated plasmid was then used to transform the E. coli strain BL21, which is a powerful strain for synthesis of recombinant proteins. In contrast to Gram-positive bacteria, the Gram-negative bacterium E. coli does not produce c-di-AMP and growth is not affected by the signaling molecule.
In order to analyze the DAC activity in vivo, DAC production by the E. coli clones was induced by adding IPTG. The cells were then lysed to extract c-di-AMP from the cells.
By performing the SDS PAGE, we could nicely show that the desired protein was well-produced (Fig. 1). Furthermore, the presence of c-di-AMP in the supernatant of the lysed bacteria was confirmed using LC-MS/MS. Thus, we can conclude that the truncated DacA protein codes for an DAC domain that is active in vivo.
Fig. 1. Confirmation of DAC production. The SDS PAGE revealed high-level DAC production by three biological replicates. As expected, the DAC domain has a molecular wight of about 20 kDa; Lane 1: Thermo Scientific Page Ruler Plus Prestained Protein Ladder.
DACs catalyze the condensation reaction of two molecules of ATP to a single molecule c-di-AMP, while releasing two pyrophosphate (PP) molecules, consisting of the β-γ-phosphates (P) of each ATP (Fig. 2). In order to analyze the DAC activity in vitro, we performed an assay in which the generation of PP molecules served as an indicator for c-di-AMP production. Among other things such as malachite-green and molybdate, the assay included a PP phosphatase that cleaves the PP molecule into free P molecules. Malachite-green forms a complex with free P molecules and molybdate stabilizes the complex. The product absorption can be measured at a wavelength of 630 nm. With this in vitro assay, the concentration of free P molecules and thus the conversion rate of ATP to c-di-AMP was analyzed.
Our results confirmed that the DAC domain of the DacA enzyme (Lmo2120) is active in the presence of a divalent cation, ATP and a buffer system at pH 8 (in vitro), however, the catalysis rate in vivo appears to be much more efficient.
Fig. 2. c-di-AMP production and degradation. c-di-AMP is produced from two molecules of ATP by DACs and degraded to pApA by phosphodiasterases. (Edited from Corrigan and Gründling, 2013)
Finally, we are coming to the core of our project, the protein structure of the DacA DAC domain! It is very helpful to have the molecular structure of a DAC in hands because it allows to perform in silico experiments. These in silico experiments can lead to the discovery of new antibacterial substance classes, that specifically inhibit DAC activity. The final goal is to use potential antibiotics to treat patients that suffer from infection with pathogenic Gram-positive bacteria.
In order to purify a large amount of this protein, we used our BioBrick BBa_K1045003 to produce the N-terminally Strep-tagged DAC domain in E. coli. Expression was confirmed by SDS PAGE and the protein showed a molecular weight of about 20 kDa (Fig. 3). The E. coli strain was grown in a large scale (10 liters), the cells were harvested by centrifugation, lysed and the protein was purified by affinity purification (Fig. 3).
Fig. 3. SDS PAGE showing high-level production and purification of the DAC domain. (A) Lane 1: Thermo Scientific PageRuler Plus Prestained Protein Ladder; NI: Non-induced clone, the cells did not produce the DAC domain and c-di-AMP; I: Induction of dac expression with IPTG, the clone synthesized the DAC domain and c-di-AMP was detected; L: Lysate; FT: Flow-through; the protein eluted in the first elution fraction.
Having dialyzed and concentrated the purified protein, we obtained a protein solution with a concentration of about 10 mg/ml, which was sufficient to perform a crystallization screening. Luckily, we have obtained very nice crystals in the initial crystallization screen (Fig. 4A). In order to find the perfect supplements for growing our crystals, the whole procedure was repeated and the conditions were refined. The crystals yielded an x-ray diffraction pattern, with a resolution of 2,8 Å (Fig. 4B,C). The dataset was measured at the EMBL Hamburg Beamline P13 at the PETRA III synchrotron on the DESY campus, using a PILATUS2 6M X-ray detector ( https://www.dectris.com/ ).
Finally, we were also able to obtain the protein structure (Fig. 5)! The structure shows a globular protein with a distinct ATP-binding cleft. The ribbon model demonstrates the secondary structure composed of α-helices and β-sheets.

Team Göttingen!
Hello, here are greetings from Göttingen!
An international group of ambitious and enthusiastic master students of the master programs ""Microbiology and Biochemistry"", ""Developmental, Neural, and Behavioral Biology"" and ""Molecular Biology"" of the Georg-August-University of Göttingen, has teamed up once again to participate in the iGEM competition 2013.
Our team is supported by Prof. Dr. Stülke , Dr. Fabian Commichau and Dr. Katrin Gunka (Department of General Microbiology). They act as advisors for our project and support us in planning and organizing.
As the achievements and the stories of our iGEM team 2012 impressed us, the iGEM competition caught our attention. The idea of having our own research project including planning, organizing, fund raising, designing and performing experiments convinced us to participate this year to continue and distribute the iGEM spirit .
We are the ones who know how to have fun when PCRs don’t work, when proteins refuse to be expressed, when gels are a total mess and when the deadline is just about to hit us. To know more, click HERE!

As is said popularly in society, “Team work is the secret that makes common people achieve uncommon results ” and let there be no doubt that there has been     a long list of people and organizations that have helped us in many ways so that we can keep working towards this project independently and with our own     creative ideas right since it’s conception.
First and foremost we are ever so grateful to the Department of Biotechnology, IIT Madras and more so to the Head of Department- Prof. Mukesh Doble and     Senior Prof. K.B. Ramachandran for believing in the project and supporting it from the very beginning.
Dr. Mukesh DobleProcess control, Chemical engineering, I.I.T. Madras

Mitan Sutradhar
The man behind the idea. A devoted biologist and a staunch meat eater, we are not surprised that he wanted to eliminate all toxins from his precious food. His life works in a binary system-food and sleep. Once in a while, the system crashes and you can see him make an appearance in the lab. When he is not luring others into mischief, you can find him immersed in research papers, carefully fine-tuning our solutions. He is (in)famous among professors for his brilliant attendance record. On occasions when he does attend classes, he manages to puzzle everyone, more so because of his jabber than his intricate questions. ""WeCanNeutraliseShigaToxin"" were his first inspiring (read incomprehensible) 'words' to our team. A reward of 100$ to anyone who can decipher his ramble in the first go.
Mitan is a 4th year Undergraduate in the Department of Biotechnology. His research interest lies in immunology and cancer biology. YouCanHearHimBlabberAt msmitans4@gmail.com. Beware! Don't steal his food. If you do, he will look for you, he will find you and he will kill you.
Namit Holay
Our team has had a long distance relationship with Namit when he had been whisked away by                      NTU, Singapore on an exchange program. We went through occasional rough patches but eventually                       made it through when Namit promised to spy on other iGEM teams for us. He seems to have a strong                       aversion to clothes and we wouldn't be too surprised if he dresses up in a sweaty shirt and skimpy                       shorts for a professional meeting. Ironically, he is as round as a drum but calls everyone else fat. In his                       free time, he tries to give ‘life advices' to whoever would listen to him.This is the time everybody claims                       that they have work to do and the lab becomes suspiciously empty. Don't get us wrong- he is perfectly                       capable of handing out some great advice. With prior experience and exposure to lab techniques, he                       leads the team ahead.
Namit is a fourth year Undergraduate in the Department of Biotechnology. He wishes to work on                       Cancer Biology in the future and has some illuminating views on Oncology. You can hear him preach at                       namit.sholay@gmail.com.                      P.S-Free advice for ze ladies!
Kanishka Waghmare
This little girl, oops, boy is involved in the Bioinformatics group of the team. He was an                      innocent boy till his summer intern in Germany, where he apparently ‘worked' on cocaine addiction. He                       claims to have tested cocaine on mice, but we are not so sure. His laugh invites funny imitations from                       all the members of the team ,at which he buries his head in his hands. When he is not checking out                       the release dates of the upcoming seasons of TV shows, you can find him working hard and picking up                       Computational Biology techniques.
Kanishka is a final year Undergraduate in the Department of Biotechnology. He wishes to work in the field of                       neuroscience in the future.You can tickle his neurons and hear him laugh at kanishkatks@gmail.com.
Mayank Choudhary
Introducing ‘Mr. Versatile' of the team. Be it PR, prowess in wetlab or drylab, he is your man.                      Throw a random quizzing question at him and he will answer it for you. He could be wrong, but                      he has an ability to convince you the other way. His ability to fall asleep anywhere, anytime is                      quite the envy of the other team-mates who haven't been bestowed with such a priceless talent. A lot                       of freshers are seen asking him for tips on how one can fall asleep. Open mouthed. In the first row. Right                       under the professor's stern eye. When he is not asleep in the weirdest of places, he is molesting Mitan                       or pranking some other team member . Either that, or he is helping out all the sections of lab work.
Mayank is a final year Undergraduate, currently studying gene expression in the Cardiovascular Genetics Lab,                        in the Department of Biotechnology. In the future, he plans to work on the molecular origins of diseases and                       the associated gene expression dysregulation and hopes to greatly impact human health, and diagnostics and              therapeutics. Don't miss a chance to know our ‘know-it-all' by mailing him at mayank.nk.choudhary@gmail.com
Nandita Damaraju
Meet the kid of the team. Technically, Nandita should be junior to everyone else on the team,                      but she isn't. She says she was so smart in her school that they decided to promote her to an advanced                       grade but we don't really buy that explanation. We suspect she bribed the Headmaster of her school                       and just skipped a year. But don't make the mistake of making fun of her ‘tender age.' She is quite feisty                       and wouldn't hesitate to give you a whack or two.
She has a very sharp brain – so sharp that it extracts a double meaning out of almost every                       straightforward sentence! If you hear her giggle in the midst of a serious discussion, you can be sure that                       the ""Mother of Double Entendres"" has struck again! She is quite multi-talented as well – strumming a                       guitar, sketching a portrait, attempting to play football, writing cryptic codes in MATLAB – she does it all.                      Nandita is a final year Undergraduate in the Department of Biotechnology. She breathes Systems                       Biology and hopes to pursue it in the quest of establishing protein networks and modeling their                       interactions. Feel free to amuse the kid with a lollypop at nandita94@gmail.com. Wait, you can surely                       hear her giggle now.
Junaid Babu
If you want to know the trick of getting into a team - any team - anytime, then you have to take pointers from this guy. He possesses some super-valuable skills - the ones that poor teams like ours desperately want. And we didnt even have to bribe him with a guaranteed flight ticket to Hong Kong or a years supply of Coke! He was kind enough to come to our rescue without asking for much. He didnt even ask for this Bio, but this is the cheapest thing we can do for him, so we will do it! Junaid has single-handedly designed our entire Wiki page. We give him content and he makes a web page out of it! He is a real wizard. Also he seems to be totally not interested in biology. And yet he has been an integral member of our team albeit for a short time!
If you want to know anything about web pages and their design, feel free to buzz our man here. But be careful, he might just weave a 'web' around you that can leave you astounded!
Aman Kumar
One does not simply get positive clones and not be Aman. He is the cloning guru of the team.                      Rumor has it that he has never ever failed at cloning. Only if he could clone himself, the wet lab work                       would have been done at lightning speed.
In his free time, he watches lame comedy shows on television and laughs out loud at the pathetic jokes.                       Speaking of laughter, he owns the patent on the most unique laughing style for a grown-up. He laughs                       like a baby, his high-pitch cackle having the ring of innocence. But don't be deceived, he is equally adept                       at conjuring up mischief and troubling you till you get exasperated. In particular, he enjoys announcing                       that his experiment has failed when it actually has shown good results, just to see the disappointment                       on our faces. But we can let that pass, given that he is the work engine of the team.
Aman is a fourth year Undergraduate in the Department of Biotechnology working in currently working in the Cardiovascular Lab.                       In the future, he wishes to go past research at just the molecular level and instead, work at a platform                       where he can have a direct impact on human health. You can mail him your cloning queries at                       aman.amp003@gmail.com. But better be quick because he might just start charging for solving them,                       soon!
Nishita Mohan
No, she is not one of those girls who wanted to make a career out of modeling but was forced                      to study Biology by her parents. She is just one of those typically rare ""beauty-with-brains"". Well, I can                       at least guarantee about the beauty. She is also responsible for more than half of the team's publicity on                       online media. You see, she has a way of getting people to do her bidding.                      Nishita is your Miss-Goody-Two-Shoes – the kind of good girls they talk about in story-books. She also                       has an eye for fashion and likes to flaunt her exquisite wardrobe ever so often. She probably figures                       in the list of ""Top 10 crazy Harry Potter fans"" and loves everything about the series. When she's not                       immersed in a novel or out shopping, you can find her in a Bioinformatics lab working on some protein                       modeling.
Nishita is a fourth year Undergraduate in the Department of Biotechnology. She is totally into                       computational biology and wants to engage herself in Bioinformatics for the next five years of her life.                       Get candid with her at nishi.rachel1111@gmail.com. But guys beware, she might just release an Avada                       Kedavra on you. Yes, her charm can be killing.
Rohan Bendre
aka Avatar aka Dodo is the funny guy of the team. Blessed with a great sense of humor, his                      uncanny imitations of fellow labmates and department seniors keep us all in fits of laughter. He is often                       seen around in the lab singing tunelessly or shaking a leg (read potbelly). We believe he could have                       played the protagonist in the movie ‘Avatar' effortlessly- No animations/make up required (Imagine the                       amount of money the Directors could have saved!) When he is around, the team works with high spirits,                       laughing all the way at his clown antics. He is quite the Biology enthusiast and  contributed to IITM iGEM                       along with Aman, for an entire summer. In his free time, he likes to read literature and short stories. We                       can assure you that he can give at least 3 synonyms for every muddling word in English. But make sure                       you have a dictionary to test him, this guy is born with a gift to prank!
Rohan is a fourth year undergraduate in the Department of Biotechnology. He is currently working in the                       Vascular Biology lab of the department. Get to ready to stimulate your happy hormones and laugh out                       loud when you mail him at robens004@gmail.com.

Idonnya Aghoghogbe
2nd year AIV Master student at Université Paris Descartes.
I obtained my Bsc in Biochemistry at the University of Birmingham, UK. I am deeply interested in biomedical studies and medicine. During the AIV’s first year master programme, I was afforded the opportunity to study synthetic, computational and systems biology. This allowed me to discover that new approaches in medicine can be taken using the principles of synthetic and systems biology. Such approaches are evident in our iGEM project, which I am very excited to be a part of.  Using synthetic biology, we are trying to address an age old medical problem in an innovative yet plausible way.
Iva Atanasković
1st year in Molecular biology and physiology, University of Belgrade - Faculty of Biology
I'm doing a Bachelor in biology in Serbia, and I came to Paris to do my summer internship in iGEM. In Serbia I work as an advisor in Petnica Science Center. There we are going to form a new iGEM team next year, so all the experiences from this internship will be very helpful. In Petnica I did several projects in microbiology, mostly regarding bioremediation technologies. I didn't have much chance to do any molecular or cellular biology, so I'm highly interested in learning new methods in this field. I also enjoy doing street art and martial arts.
Camelia Bencherif
6th year pharmacy student at Université Paris Sud 11, 1st year of hospital pharmacy at hôpital Hôtel-Dieu de Paris, and 2nd year Master in Clinical and experimental Pharmacology at Université Pierre et Marie Curie.
What I love in Synthetic Biology is that we can be creative in Sciences and not only in Arts. iGEM project should be the dream of every undergraduate student who wants to become a researcher: create our own project, work with a brilliant team and have a lot of fun! I am also volunteer at “Médecins du monde” (Doctor’s of the World) where I make Thin-layer Chromatography to analyse drugs. I like dancing, theater, playing guitar, reading and diving to admire the beauty of the ocean!
Clovis Basier
2nd year in Licence Frontières du Vivant, at Université Paris Descartes.
I’m currently doing a bachelor in biology, chemistry and physics at the Centre de Recherche Interdisciplinaire de Paris. I’m new in the research world but extremely motivated to learn and to succeed. I am very interested in the interdisciplinarity of biology, especially in genetics and synthetic biology which are likely to be a really huge field in science soon, as it’s beginning to grow fast. I enjoy doing challenging experiences as much as work in team and I’m sure that IGEM will be a great one.
Marguerite Benony
2nd year of DSAA (1st year Master) in product design at l'Ecole Boulle, Paris.
I am a 22 years old recently graduated product designer. While I was studying applied arts, I became deeply interested in Biology and harnessed my designer's energy to seek/assess the potential of an exciting upcoming field: Bio-design. Whilst investigating the friction of design with Biology, I discovered Synthetic Biology. I became instantly amazed by its potential in real life implication and the role that design could have in this technology. Naturally, I then wanted to acquire actual wet lab experience in Synthetic Biology, enabling me to explore how designers can work with scientists and what are their roles, missions, interest would be. I believe iGEM is the best place for this investigation!
Aude Bernheim
2nd year AIV Master student. 3rd Year AgroParisTech, Paris Institute of Life sciences.
I am currently completing an engineering degree in life sciences by studying interdisciplinary research at the Centre de Recherches Interdisciplinaires.  My scientific interests and previous research experience revolves around  evolution, genetics architecture, genomics and of course synthetic biology. In parraleĺ of those scientific topics, I have been studying and working in the field of public policies, especially agricultural and food ones. I got the chance of working on those very different subjects in various environnements  by living in Paris, Berlin, Washington and Shanghai. Outside my work, I am involved in different associations, mostly around science outreach. This year,  I founded an association called WAX Science which tackles inequalities, especially gender inequalities in science.
Matthew Deyell
2nd year AIV Master student at Université Paris Diderot,
I obtained my BSc. in Cellular, Molecular and Microbiology at the University of Calgary, Canada.  After which I worked as a research associate at the University of Leicester, UK working on genome and population dynamics in Pseudomonas aeruginosa.  I am very interested in bridging approaches and techniques from various fields to tackle complex problems in biology.  I am a highly problem motivated scientist and enjoy experimental design, as such I am excited at the prospect to take part in this years iGEM competition.  The iGEM competition is the ideal place to branch out into exciting new fields, enhance and broaden our skill set and showcase our talent and ideas in an international setting.
Sebastian Jaramillo-Riveri
2nd year AIV Master student at Université Paris Descartes.
I have a bachelor in Biology from Universidad de Chile and some experience doing research. I was part for two years of the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, working in bioinformatics and proteomics; and spent six months at the University of Edinburgh working on rule-based modeling. Last year I arrived to the AIV master program in Paris. My interests are related to the use of theoretical models to understand the kinetics of biochemical networks. I find Synthetic Biology exiting because its desire for precise abstractions; and its possibility for making interesting feedback between experimental design and hypothesis coming from modeling. During my free-time I like cooking, reading and dancing.
Nicolas Koutsoubelis
2nd year AIV Master student at Université Paris Descartes.
I am from Germany and biologist by training. Synthetic Biology is a very interdisciplinary and emerging field in Science. It offers many possibilities for the future. The iGEM competition is a main driving force for the visions of Synthetic Biology. I like the creativity, group work, interaction and exchanges about Science that are part of the competition process. As the CRI is a place for visions and future project, I am really looking forward to work with the team on a visionary project that will further form Synthetic Biology.
Vincent Libis
6th year pharmacy student and M2 AIV student.
I started learning pharmacy at Strasbourg University to become a researcher and as I was specializing in therapeutic innovation based on biotechnology I heard about synthetic biology. I became more and more convinced that this young field had a huge potential for fighting human diseases and I eventually came to Paris to study it intensively through internships in laboratories and through the AIV master. By doing iGEM I hope to have the chance to show creativity in applying the concepts I have learnt so far and to take advantage of the exciting working context of a truly interdisciplinary and multinational team.
Anne Löchner
2nd year AIV Master student at Université Paris Descartes.
I am biologist from Germany and I am now in the AIV Master. Since I heard the first time of Synthetic Biology and iGEM, I wanted to participate in this challenging competition. I think the iGEM Team at the CRI is a great group as it has lots of potential as we are a group of students from many different backgrounds and nationalities. As Synthetic Biology is aswell very interdisciplinary I am looking forward to work on an exciting project with the team and learn more about science and the emerging field of Synthetic Biology.
Sarah Zahra
2nd year Biomedical Engineering Master - Paris Descartes & Paris Tech Institute.
I have a bachelor in biomedical sciences and I like to explore the interface between different disciplines, and that is why I enrolled in the master. I also got the chance to follow synthetic and computational biology in the AIV track at the CRI, which made me discover what an amazing field synthetic biology is! One of my goals is to try to adress the bottleneck of therapies through synthetic biology tools. But I am also interested in exploring new perspectives that sythetic biology allowed us to open. I am looking forward for the iGEM teamwork, because I am sure we are going to have a very exciting experiment, on both the scientific and the human level!
Yonatan Zegman
2nd year AIV Master student at Université Paris Descartes.
I come from sunny Tel Aviv, Israel. I Have a B.Sc in Biotechnology. I spent my first year of master learning the fields of system's biology and synthetic biology. I Love the creativity that Synthetic biology brought to this field and I appreciate the opportunity for free thinking. I like the competitive nature of iGEM and I think it will help us produce a beautiful project.
Ariel Lindner
Researcher at INSERM, Director of the AIV Master at the Paris Descartes and Paris Diderot Universities.
I'm a researcher director at the Systems Evolutions and Engineering Dynamics (SEED) group at the French national Biomedical research Institute (INSERM) and co-founder of the Centre for Research and Interdisciplinarity (CRI) . Since 2006 I've been mentoring the first French team to participate in the iGEM adventure and still enjoy being challenged by team's students and see their projects flower.
Zoran Marinkovic
1st year PhD of the FdV doctoral school at Université Paris Diderot
I am a first year PhD student from the Frontières du Vivant PhD school. I studied Molecular Biology at University of Zagreb (Croatia) and did a semester long exchange at Uppsala University (Sweden) where I studied Microbial and Evolutionary Genetics and Bioinformatics. I spent almost whole last year working on application of synthetic biology in fundamental research and participating in iGEM as a part of the Paris Bettencourt team on a highly noticed and successful project.  My primary scientific interest is application of synthetic biology for creating bioproducts as well as using synthetic biology in fundamental research. Also, I’m quite interested in developing synthetic biology as a tool for creating living organisms from scratch as we build many non-living constructs today. I joined iGEM team again this year because I had a lot of fun last year and because it is a unique research opportunity that only rare get to experience.
Mathias Toulouze
PhD student, FdV doctoral school at Université Paris Descartes
I’m a  first year PhD student from the Frontières du Vivant PhD school and CEA, working on the dynamical behavior of chromatin. I understood the potential of synthetic biology when I participated in iGEM 2011 as a team member, during this experience I learnt a lot about research,  and more specifically I understood how to design a good research project. This year I participate in iGEM as an advisor, in order to share my passion for science and to try to make our participation in iGEM a success.
Jake Wintermute
Postdoctoral Researcher
I’m a postdoc at the CRI and I teach the Synthetic Biology course for first-year master’s students. I did my Ph.D. in Pam Silver’s lab in the Harvard Systems Biology department. My research interests include aging, evolution, metabolism and of course Synthetic Biology. This will be my second year as an iGEM advisor and I expect very good science from this team!

Host Lab
We were hosted at the CRI (Centre for Research and Interdisciplinarity) located in the University Paris Descartes.  The host lab provided us all the machines necessary for microbiology and molecular biology such as centrifuges, PCR machines, sterile hoods, freezers, incubators, microscopes, plate readers, glassware, a NanoDrop machine, etc.. We were in charge of taking care of the stocks as well as ordering lab consumables such as gloves, plates, pipettes, tips, and tubes as well as chemicals and DNA. All the media preparation and the glassware washing was done by us.
None of the subjects of this project are being studied or developed in the host lab.

Title
Erwin Schrodinger1887-1961
Died from Tuberculosis†
Physicist
Schrödinger suffered from tuberculosis and several times in the 1920s stayed at a sanatorium in Arosa. It was there that he formulated his wave equation. He died because of Tuberculosis the 4th of January 1961, in Vienna at the age of 73.
Cat StevensBorn in 1948
He had Tuberculosis
British Musicien
Stevens contracted tuberculosis in 1969 and was close to death at the time of his admittance to the King Edward VII Hospital. He spent months recuperating in the hospital and a year of convalescence. During this time Stevens began to question aspects of his life, and spirituality.
Vivien Leigh1913-1967
Died from Tuberculosis†
Actress
Vivien Leigh suffered recurrent bouts of chronic tuberculosis, first diagnosed in the mid-1940s, which ultimately claimed her life at the age of 53.
Voltaire1694-1778
He had Tuberculosis
Writer, philosopher and playwright
George Orwell1903-1950
Died from Tuberculosis†
English novelist / essayist
This English author, best known for his novels 1984 and Animal Farm, spent time in a tuberculosis sanatorium in 1938. In 1947 he was diagnosed with TB again. He struggled with this infection, going in and out of hospital until he died in 1950 of a hemorrhaged lung.
Johann Goethe1749-1832
He had Tuberculosis
German writer/scientist
Johann Schiller1759-1805
He had Tuberculosis
German writer/historian
Frederic Chopin1810-1849
Died from Tuberculosis†
Polish composer/pianist
Chopin's disease and the cause of his death have since been a matter of debate.  The terminal symptoms of pulmonary tuberculosis resemble those of cystic fibrosis, which would be described and named only a century later; but in the 19th century, in the absence of modern respiratory therapy and medical support, survival with cystic fibrosis to age 39 was virtually impossible. Given Chopin's history and symptoms, it seems likely that he suffered from pulmonary tuberculosis.
Paul Gauguin1848-1903
He had Tuberculosis
French painter
Paul Gauguin had Tuberculosis but he died of Syphillis instead
Eleanor Roosvelt1884-1962
Died from Tuberculosis†
American humanitarian/first lady
In April 1960, Eleanor Roosevelt was diagnosed with aplastic anemia. In 1962, she was given steroids which activated a dormant case of bone marrowtuberculosis. She died of resulting cardiac failure at her Manhattan home.
Franz Kafka1883–1924
Died from Tuberculosis†
Czech author
Kafka was diagnosed with tuberculosis in August 1917. He died there on 3 June 1924. His cause of death seemed to be starvation: the condition of Kafka's throat made eating too painful for him, and since parenteral nutrition had not yet been developed, there was no way to feed him
Edvard Munch1863-1944
He had Tuberculosis
Norwegian painter
Emily Bronte1818-1848
Died from Tuberculosis†
English novelist
Anne and Emily Brontë and other members of the Brontë family of writers, poets and painters were struck by TB. Anne, their brother Branwell, and Emily all died of it within 2 years of each other. Charlotte Brontë's death in 1855 was stated at the time as having been due to TB, but there is some controversy over this today.

All primer design, PCR, cloning reactions, gels, minipreps, midipreps, nanodropping, transfections, splitting, competent cell making, etc were performed by members of MIT iGEM 2013. All Zeiss and Evos microscopy was done by MIT iGEM 2013 students. All sample preparation for BCA assays, sequencing, confocal, and cytometry were done by MIT iGEM 2013. Sequencing reactions were dispatched to Genewiz and alignments were done by students. Primers were ordered from IDT and resuspended and used by students. Confocal and Cytometry samples were prepped by students, run by instructors, and analyzed by students. All DNA designs were done by students, presented to instructors for feedback (and subsequent revisions usually), and iterated until we were confident it would work.  To identify exactly where instructors assisted:
Deepak Mishra and Brian Teague, two of our advisors, taught us how to clone, general experimental techniques, and conducted training sessions on fluorescence microscopy on the Zeiss scope. After 3 hours of supervised training with one of them, several of us students were given access to the scheduling interface and could book the scope during normal hours to operate it ourselves. Similarly, we were given access to a simple tissue culture scope, the Evos system, for unsupervised use after training.
For cytometry, due to new rules enacted at MIT, undergraduates were not allowed to physically run samples on the instrument. Thus, team members would plan experiments, execute, and prepare samples suspended in PBS-1X solution before putting them on ice and giving them to an instructor to run for them. The staff member (NOT iGEM member) would sit with the student and run the samples and then provide a copy of *.fcs files to the team that we then wrote custom MATLAB code in conjunction with FlowJo to analyze.
For confocal microscopy, the lab does not allow undergraduates or any grad/post-doc operator that has not completed the 10 hour Leica Training offered once a year to operate the instrument. Thus, team members would plan experiments, execute, and prepare the wells in media before bringing them to the microscope for an instructor to load onto the scope. Each team member that prepared samples went through mandatory lectures on confocal microscopy (3 hours total) but were not allowed to operate the instrument. The instructors provided *.lif and *.tif files to us which we then used ImageJ to open, analyze, and export for publication on the wiki.
Nathan Kipniss, a member of the 2012 MIT iGEM team, assisted with the initial tissue culture training. All experiments on the wiki were executed by team members and no instructor ever split our cells, supplemented our media, or gave us any assistance outside of ordering reagants for us due to our inability to navigate MIT PO numbers.
Samira Kiani, whose work inspired the Cas9-CRISPR parts of our project, also advised our team and was a valuable resource as a trained medical doctor.
We would also like to thank the 2012 MIT iGEM team for allowing us to adapt their wiki design for our use with permission. Without all of these contributions, our work this summer would not have been possible.

Our instructors and other individuals from outside the Weiss lab provided the training necessary for us to conduct our work. Deepak Mishra and Brian Teague, two of our advisors, taught cloning and experimental techniques, conducted training on fluorescence microscopy on the Zeiss scope, and operated FACS and the confocal microscope. Jonathan Babb, also an advisor, helped teach cloning techniques and assisted the team with the liquid handling robot. Nathan Kipniss, a member of the 2012 MIT iGEM team, assisted with the initial tissue culture training. We were lucky to have Samira Kiani, whose work inspired the Cas9-CRISPR parts of our project, to advise out team. Her help with training and with design and assembly strategies was invaluable. We would also like to thank the 2012 MIT iGEM team for providing our wiki design. Without all of these contributions, our work this summer would not have been possible.
Otherwise, all of the data presented on the results page was generated by members of the 2013 MIT iGEM team, with the exception of FACS and some microscopy, time-lapse images in particular.

Wet Lab Software Human Practices Design Sponsors
Members of the wet lab undergraduate team, Wilson Lam, Dylan Siriwardena, Lloyd Mai, and Yara Abou-Hamde, built all network constructs along with the submitted BioBrick parts. Martin Hanzel built constructs designed to test an ethanol-inducible promoter and a copper-inducible promoter. Richard Beard built constructs to test functionality of chromoproteins. Dylan, Lloyd, Wilson and Yara handled yeast and E. coli transformations. Wilson and Yara ran flow cytometry.
Wilson Lam accomplished the overall network design with advice provided by team advisors Afnan Azizi and Ian Roney. The lab advisors also contributed to the day-to-day troubleshooting and helped in the training of the undergraduate team. Our lab technician, Mila Tepliakova, assisted in the safety training of the undergraduate team and provided advice throughout the progression of the project. Dr. Mads Kaern provided the team with lab resources and extensive advice and support.
The differential equations model for the system and implementation in MATLAB were done by Paul Reginato from the University of Waterloo iGEM team. This was only possible as a result of the great collaboration between the University of Waterloo iGEM team and the uOttawa iGEM teams learn more . Parameterization and analysis of the model to show pulse and fold change detection were done by Nicolas Tremblay from the University of Ottawa iGEM team with extensive guidance of Daniel Charlebois advisor for the uOttawa iGEM team. Martin Hanzel did the bulk of the work on the team Wiki with some assistance from the design team.
Bricklayer was built by Kevin Rutkay, Peter Doan, Martin Hanzel, and Mohammed Chamma. Mohammed designed the architecture and wrote the search feature using Parts Registry's API. Peter implemented the RFCs, the primer generation code, and the melting temperature calculations. Kevin created the Brick Bin, adding the ability to select and save bricks that will make up the user's final construct. Martin designed the look and feel of the app's search, results, bin, and construction interfaces. Many thanks to the wet lab team, especially Dylan and Wilson, for sitting with the dry lab and explaining the biology to us.
Mr. Cool’s Microscopic Adventures  was written by undergraduates Daniel Tesolin, Katie Harriman, Michael Xiang, Alexandra Huluta, Caitlin Johnston, Nicholas Huang, Marina Kidisyuk, Abdus Subhan Anwar, Curtis Quan, Amir Hamid, Kaitlin Kharas, Shihad Sarwar, Irene Harmsen, Meshach David, Rizwan Awan, and Fiatsgobe Dzuali.

Whatsup y'all! I'm Wilson Lam, and to date, I have had the privilege of being a member of the uOttawa iGEM Team for three years. I'm currently studying towards the awesomeness that is an Honours B.Sc. with Specialization in Biochemistry. This year, I was named the President of the team, and I cannot be more proud of what we have been able to accomplish this year. We have collected an incredible group of people on the team, and I'm proud to be a part of a group of such hardworking synthetic biologists. Feel free to follow my ramblings @1MaginAZN!
My name is Yara Abou-Hamde and I will be starting my third year of university this fall. I am studying Biomedical Science with an Option in Medicinal Chemistry. Science is a huge part of who I am and it has been a truly exceptional experience working in the lab as part of iGEM this year. I learned so much about synthetic biology, scientific research and communication as it relates to a research environment. My colleagues and I have worked incredibly hard and I am grateful for both collective and individual efforts. I look forward to competing and meeting fellow iGEM teams!
My name is Dylan Siriwardena, however the question of who I am is a much more complicated question. Since it would take far too long for you (the reader) to glean an understanding of my very soul, I shall limit myself to the superficial. I am a third year Biology student, and I am currently working in the wet lab for this year's iGEM team. Being my first year in iGEM, I am excited to be a part of such a large international competition. My interests include rollerblading, history, martial arts, and hair care. I'm hoping to make a living somewhere in the field of Biology.
Martin Hanzel is starting his first year in Biomedical Science, and is involved in uOttawa's iGEM team as part of his Undergrad Research Scholarship. He works both in the lab and on the computer science team, and is the principal meme creator for iGEM. He thinks highly of his partners and lab mates and is excited to work on such a complex and innovative research project. His hobbies include travel, music, messing with the genetic code of organisms, and speaking in the third person.
Hi, my name is Lloyd Mai and I am starting my third year of Biochemistry studies this fall. This is my first year on the iGEM team and I had a great time working in the wet lab with my colleagues. Synthetic biology is such an interesting field of research and I hope it inspires amazing iGEM projects all around the world. Looking forward to seeing this year’s competition!
Howdy! I'm Richard and I'm going into my first year of Biomedical Science at the University of Ottawa. Synthetic Biology is redesigning life on Earth, and that's pretty cool. As a member of uOttawa's 2013 iGEM team, I'm trying to learn how to do it!

Outside of iGem, I enjoy exploring new things and places.
I'm Kevin Rutkay, a fourth year Software Engineering student and am a part of the dry lab team. This is my first year on the iGEM team; I found iGEM was a great way to learn more about biology, which is one field that is really missing from my studies. When I'm not staring at a computer, I enjoy photography, baking, and a nice cup of tea.
Hi, I'm Mohammed Chamma. I'm studying Mathematical Physics here at uOttawa and I'm going into my third year. In my free time I do lots of coding and software development. I'm on the dry lab of the iGEM uOttawa team where I mainly work on an app we're making called ""Bricklayer"". Having never taken a formal biology course, I joined iGEM in the hopes that I'll learn more about biology and especially DNA. So far it's been great; I've learned a ton and met lots of cool people along the way. I think that everything iGEM is about is great and I can't wait to see more.
Hi, I am Nicolas, and I am currently a student enrolled in Software Engineering at the University of Ottawa. Having pursued three years of undergraduate studies in bio pharmaceutical sciences, I have acquired the knowledge to understand the chemistry behind the biological systems that surround us.

Whatsup y'all! I'm Wilson Lam, and to date, I have had the privilege of being a member of the uOttawa iGEM Team for three years. I'm currently studying towards the awesomeness that is an Honours B.Sc. with Specialization in Biochemistry. This year, I was named the President of the team, and I cannot be more proud of what we have been able to accomplish this year. We have collected an incredible group of people on the team, and I'm proud to be a part of a group of such hardworking synthetic biologists. Feel free to follow my ramblings @1MaginAZN!
My name is Yara Abou-Hamde and I will be starting my third year of university this fall. I am studying Biomedical Science with an Option in Medicinal Chemistry. Science is a huge part of who I am and it has been a truly exceptional experience working in the lab as part of iGEM this year. I learned so much about synthetic biology, scientific research and communication as it relates to a research environment. My colleagues and I have worked incredibly hard and I am grateful for both collective and individual efforts. I look forward to competing and meeting fellow iGEM teams!
My name is Dylan Siriwardena, however the question of who I am is a much more complicated question. Since it would take far too long for you (the reader) to glean an understanding of my very soul, I shall limit myself to the superficial. I am a third year Biology student, and I am currently working in the wet lab for this year's iGEM team. Being my first year in iGEM, I am excited to be a part of such a large international competition. My interests include rollerblading, history, martial arts, and hair care. I'm hoping to make a living somewhere in the field of Biology.
Martin Hanzel is starting his first year in Biomedical Science, and is involved in uOttawa's iGEM team as part of his Undergrad Research Scholarship. He works both in the lab and on the computer science team, and is the principal meme creator for iGEM. He thinks highly of his partners and lab mates and is excited to work on such a complex and innovative research project. His hobbies include travel, music, messing with the genetic code of organisms, and speaking in the third person.
Hi, my name is Lloyd Mai and I am starting my third year of Biochemistry studies this fall. This is my first year on the iGEM team and I had a great time working in the wet lab with my colleagues.

A motivated and enthusiastic individual who is the guiding light of our team. Meet Michiel, the multi-tasker. I can assure you that you cant find a better leader if you go searching for one in broad daylight with a candle (or a glowing algae for that matter). He is doing a dual Master(because apparently one is not enough)in Process Biotechnology and Bio-informatics. Our taskmaster is interested in determining the origin of single cell Aspergillus niger by comparative transcriptome analysis. Also, he is modelling the production of the drug, lovastatin in A. niger. And he is setting up a database for secondary metabolite backbone enzymes in Aspergilli! Phew. In his remaining time he likes to cook, read European history, watch movies and get drunk in the weekends. He regrets, long hours of bench work, long hours of desk work, shaving his beard, travelling everyday to work with our supervisor Mark, life in general.
PS- A leader is one who knows the way, goes the way, and shows the way. We believe that Michiel will lead this team on their way to Boston.

Skinny Indian boy who works till midnight, no time to eat every day. Haha, just for humorous effect. (Actually it is the working profile for all of us igemers.) For him, IGEM is a challenging experience and quite a lot of fun. He’s quite a dynamic and open minded partner, works really hard and is ready to help others. Additionally, a high-effective dreamer. He could always shock us by so many fantastic ideas during lunch meetings. “What I cannot build, I cannot understand. ” is his motto and exactly what he did for his research. Well groomed hair means there would be a presentation. For the rest chaotic hair days, which equals to reading a lot of articles or just watching too much TV series & football matches.  ;)
PS: Thanks for your shared solutions, plates and cells, Shreyans!

This Bsc Molecular life sciences student was born 04-09-1990. From the moment she could walk she knew it: I want to be part of the iGem competition! Her reason to join this year was that she had to do a Bsc thesis and really liked the opportunity of designing your own project and working both individually and as a team. The most awesome moments for her were when she made a picture of her actin-GFP fusion and the group activities. Her hobbies are diverse: horseback riding, ultimate frisbee, playing guitar and transforming fungi. Summarized in ‘one sentence’: iGem is a really awesome competition where you learn a lot & have a lot of fun, where you can work both individually but mostly as a team.
Emiel ten Buren
emiel.ten.buren@wur.nl

When describing iGEM with 3 words Emiel ten Buren would describe it as a “really awesome experience”. Emiel, who was born on 16.12.1990, is a master student in the field of biochemistry and did his bachelor in molecular life science. Currently he is working on the chromoproteins we got from Uppsala and Braunschweig to optimize them for and introduce them to A. niger. Next to the practical work he is our hard working secretary and sponsoring person. When asking him why he joined the iGEM team he says that he wants to learn more about synthetic biology and likes the idea of doing it in a competitive way such as iGEM. It might be obvious that Emiel is eager to do his job well. There are a lot of things he likes about iGEM, including the team activities such as going bowling or playing pool. But he also enjoyed attending the molecular interactions symposium in Berlin for a poster presentation.
When you meet Emiel outside of the laboratory you will find a person that likes to do weird Dutch sports such as Knotsbal, football or unihockey. Next to that he likes to read books, play games with friends, watch series, play pool etc.
Marjan Verest

Being one of the more experienced students in our team, she has already finished her thesis at virology. Her work is of vital importance, also to our project, as she is working on lovastatin biosynthesis. At the same time she is also concerned with Human Practices and will be presenting at the Jamboree. Her motivation, charisma and gentle voice make her a true addition to the team and excellent spokeswoman at the Jamboree.
Vincen Wu
vincen.wu@wur.nl

There is no doubt that the most optimistic person in 2013 Wageningen iGEM group is Vincen. You will be impressed by his enthusiasm and vigour. As a Msc student from Medical Biotechnology Programme, he loves this field and plans to continue the research as PhD. Vincen joined iGEM team at the very beginning and also introduced two members to participate. He can always come up with innovative ideas, including Gibson Assembling to produce lovastatin from Aspergillus Niger. “to be able to work and solve problems indepently as a scientist"" is the most valuable thing he've learned during iGEM.
Jingjing Hu
jingjing.hu@wur.nl

You better watch out when Jingjing is around, as our safety manager she kept us in check during the summer. She is a biotechnology master student from China and together with Emiel she has been working on the chromoproteins, a colourful project that fits her personality. Jingjing is always cheerful in and out of the lab and very willing to help you out. She started out with iGEM because it is fun to do and innovative, also it enables you to come up with new ideas and then make it come true yourself. Next to that she finds that the biobrick parts are meaningful to synthetic biology. In her spare time Jingjing ejoys playing the guzheng, a chinese instrument, and the accordion or go travelling. The highlight of iGEM for her will be when Aspergillus shows colours.
Ying Deng
ying.deng@wur.nl

With only 7 people in iGEM, Denny was the 8th and last person to join. What a wonderful number, because #8 means lucky in chinese and that is what we needed, she indeed delivered. She is studying food biotechnology, even though she doesn’t have enough lab experience, she was eager and determined to learn everything she can during her stay in iGEM, like really restlessly eager. She told me that there’s only one word to describe iGEM “AMAZING!!!!!”, and that’s the attitude I like within iGEM.
Mentors and supervisors
Mark van Passel
iGEM Mentor
Being the undisputed champion of bowling, he is also a charismatic scientist trying to raise his 5yr old son. The first team he supervised included Ruben and Dorett, who are now supervising this years team. Last years’ team did very well and managed to get to Boston. He has experience as an iGEM judge last year, which makes him a knowledgeable mentor.  He himself cannot conceive of the notion that there might be things he might not want to know and this reflects in his eagerness to explore new fields. Talkative, outgoing, genuine and always in for a new challenge; he knows how to bring together a group of intellectual individuals and initiate the formation of a team.
Dorett Odoni
iGEM Mentor
She is not as talkative as Mark, but when she speaks it is always worthwhile to listen. Together with Ruben she was part of the iGEM team from 2011 where they worked on a synchronized oscillatory system. Her input during lunch meetings has been very valuable and certainly aided in the development of our ideas and finding the right secondary metabolite. She works real hard and makes long days at lab, thereby enabling the iGEM team to work after hours as well.
Ruben van Heck
iGEM Mentor
Ruben just started his PhD at the chairgroup systems and synthetic biology. He was part of the Wageningen iGEM team 2011 and this experience contributed to his choice for Bioinformatics for his master. This year he is supervising the work on the modeling and database. Together with Dorett he will stay at the lab as long as necessary for team members to finish their lab work, allowing the team to make swift progress.
Leo de Graaff
Advisor
Leo de Graaff is an associate professor at the chair group Systems and Synthetic Biology at Wageningen University. He is known as the Aspergillus niger expert and has been working on Aspergillus since his PhD, where he worked on the characterization of the XlnR regulon. Besides his input in the form of feedback and ideas concerning the project plan he has also been generous enough to spare us one of his PhD students, Laura van der Straat, and a technician, Tom Schonewille, whom have shown to be indispensable during the project.
Teresita Bello Gonzalez
Advisor
Teresita is a 2nd year PhD student at the VLAG school of Wageningen University, whose project is about the effect of antibiotic prophylaxis therapy in ICU patients. As a supervisor of the iGEM toolbox about Aspergillus pigmenti, she is always willing to help and give proper instructions. When coming across questions, she is open to discussion and debate. She thinks the iGEM competition is a really great opportunity for students to develop some skills in science, to learn about organization and to work as a team with deadlines of the project. During this toolbox, she had a great time participating in the team and learning new things related to A. Niger.
Peter Schaap
Advisor
Peter Schaap is the person to see when it comes to bioinformatics, especially in relation to Aspergillus niger. He worked on genome sequencing, comparative genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics and analysis of the secretome of Aspergillus niger. He is interested in the single cell transcriptome because it complements the current RNA landscape profile of A. niger and allows for comparison of data from different life stages.
Laura van der Straat
Advisor
Laura is a very approachable, helpful supervisor. Whenever you’re in trouble or in need of some experimental advice, she would be there to help you. Rumour is that she never failed any experiments... Yes! she got those magic hands and we hope that the magic effects might rub on to us during our iGEM competition.
Tom Schonewille
Technician
Tom is just like the manager of the lab upstairs. As the busiest & happiest guy in the lab, he would be there ready to help you with all kinds of stuff, from technical consultancy to ordering of kits. Any tough problem is just a piece of cake for him while humming a tune.  We are all very grateful for your help. Many thanks, Jerry.  ; )

Team:Penn State/Team
From 2013.igem.org
Undergraduate Team
Advisers
Undergrad Team
Andres Carbonell
Born in the tropical paradisiac lands of Panama in Central America,  Andres a Biotechnology major is going into his junior year of college, and as a gentleman in the pursuit of knowledge and  mankind's well being, has dedicated his short academic life to science and research. His goals and dreams involve a good balance of medical research  and a life of invaluable doctor-patient relationships. Andres has found in iGEM a shortcut in the long and rewarding path of mastering knowledge and happiness
Casey Hall
Casey’s passion for agriculture has led her to pursuing a major in Biological Engineering with a Food and Biological Engineering Emphasis. She is currently in her junior year and after college, she desires to attend graduate school focusing on production agriculture and genetically modified plants. It has always been her dream to help feed the world and iGEM provided a great opportunity for her to see what genetic modification is all about. Casey was our team lead this year and has also worked specifically with the CesA project from start to finish as well as the plant promoter project design and wet lab procedures. Outside of iGEM, Casey enjoys hunting, fishing, and spending time in the great outdoors.
Kevin Thyne
Kevin is a senior in Molecular Biology and Biochemistry. He joined iGEM for the opportunity to work in a lab and do new, exciting research. He worked on last year’s iGEM project and enjoyed it so much that he’s back for more! Kevin definitely adds experience and eons of knowledge to the team and is the go-to person when anyone has questions. When he’s not being a wealth of knowledge, he is involved in the American Society of Microbiology (ASM) and the National Society of Collegiate Scholars (NSCS).
Lars Berg
Lars has just finished his freshman year at the University of Oklahoma Honors College, but will begin his sophomore year at Wesleyan University in the fall. Being a part of Penn State’s iGEM team has helped him explore genomics, botany, education, and web design, which have all been helpful experiences for someone undecided on his major. Lars worked on the butanol project, the outreach presentation to teachers and students, and the website. In addition to exploring fields of study to figure out what to do with his life, he enjoys ultimate frisbee, traveling, and walking his corgi.
Laura Hoover
Entering her junior year, Laura is a Biology major focusing in vertebrate physiology. As a trained EMT, Laura plans to pursue a career in the medical field. However, her academic interests vary greatly. After learning about synthetic biology in a molecular biology course, Laura joined the Penn State iGEM team eager to learn more about the emerging field. Beyond being able to participate in undergraduate research, the experience offered her an in depth education in the planning and execution of research projects. Laura worked on both the CesA and promoter projects. In addition, Laura is heavily involved in Penn State’s IFC/Panhellenic Dance Marathon as her sorority’s THON chair for the past two years.
Michael Easterbrook
Michael is a Penn State junior, studying Chemical Engineering with intended minors in Entrepreneurship and Molecular Biology.  He has had a passion to work with genetic engineering since high school and he has been involved in genetics research since his freshman year of college.  iGEM was an exciting next step for developing his skills in synthetic biology research.  He was heavily involved with the design and construction of the cellulose synthase, cas9, and plant promoter projects.  He also learned html/CSS this summer and was responsible for a majority of the coding for the team wiki.  In his free time, he enjoys discussing philosophy, playing soccer, playing video games, and visiting family and friends.
Michael Stokes
Michael is a Penn State Senior in the field of Biotechnology.  He has had a longstanding fascination with synthetic biology and biofuels, and other biotech applications such as organ cloning.  His plans for the future to include research in biotechnology to develop these things for use in everyday life.  He joined iGEM in order to gain experience working with biotechnology.  At the start he primarily worked on the butanol project, though he became more involved in website design later on, learning html/CSS programming language, and using his previous experience with Photoshop and attention to detail to help in its construction.
Nayab Gill
Nayab recently graduated with her bachelors in Biology from Penn State. With the goal of becoming a high school Biology teacher, her next step is to pursue a masters degree in Science education. Since her undergraduate studies focused on vertebrae physiology; iGEM served as a crash course in plant and synthetic biology. Although difficult at first, it has proven to be a rewarding experience for her.  As part of the iGEM team she worked on the vanillin project and human practices. Outside of iGEM, she is a home body that enjoys reading, the cinema and spending time with family and friends.
Phillip Cygan
As a man of intelligence and drive, Philip joined iGEM this year for the first time. Going into his Senior year at Penn State, Phil is a Mathematics Education Major, planning to educate high school students in the complex ideas of mathematics and all it has to offer. Philip is involved in Penn State through many organizations and sports, leading a very active lifestyle. As an active student, he decided to try iGEM, even with a very small background, and is working on the Cas9 project and learning more than he imagined he could. He has become a lab rat, spending nearly everyday in lab, working on this project. Phil, not just a student in Math and Education, but a student in synthetic biology now too!
Sam Ewell
Sam just finished his third year of Biomedical Engineering at Penn State. His studies have focused on human biology, so iGEM has been a good opportunity for him to explore plant biology as well. During the summer he helped with the website and the butanol project, but his main focus was running our plant nursery. In order to test all these different ideas we needed a small army of plants and he made sure they grew up to be strong little soldiers. When not studying or caring for plants, he enjoys being the best.
Stephanie Everhart
Stephanie, going into her junior year at Penn State, is a Secondary Education Major in the chemistry option. She hopes to one day become a high school chemistry teacher that can inspire more students to pursue a future in science.  iGEM has given her the opportunity to explore different facets of science, which has proved very rewarding. As part of the iGEM team, Stephanie has focused her efforts on the education outreach aspect of the Human Practices component. Outside of iGEM, Stephanie enjoys running, hiking and indulging in a good movie. In addition, she is a strong advocate for military appreciation as the president of the Dear Hero Program, a student run group on campus that sends letters and care packages to troops overseas.

The Team
This year’s iGEM team consists of 18 motivated students from the fields of biology, biomolecular engineering, chemistry, computer science, electrical engineering and industrial design. The Bachelor and Master students from various semesters are again supported by Professor Dr. Heribert Warzecha and Professor Dr. Jörg Simon. In 2012 the TU Darmstadt Team was a newcomer at the iGEM competition, receiving a Gold medal on the regional competition promptly. This year we will try to base our work on last year’s experiences and focus on improving our perfomance accordingly.
Kai Fenzl
Age: 21
Studies: B. Sc. Biomolecular Engineering
Since last year I want to be part of the iGEM-team, now in the 4th semester I have time for this challenge. I am responsible for the sponsoring of our team. I hope this projekt gives me the chance to learn new laborpractice and improve my softskills.  iGEM gives me the opportunity to see the activity of synthetic biologie, because I want to write my bachelor thesis in this field of science.  I am very greatful to be a part of this awesome team.
Sascha Hein
Age: 22
Studies: M. Sc. Biomolecular Engineering
Hey, I´m Sascha. This summer I completed my B.Sc. in Bimolecular Engineering at the TUD.  I take responsibility for website and the lab management during our project. I expects an interesting summer. Moreover, he hopes to learn many new things about synthetic biology. Besides a successful participation Sascha wants to establish many international contacts.
Sven Jager
Age: 25
Studies: M. Sc. Biomolecular Engineering
Hi! My name is Sven Jager, I am a Biomolecular Engineer in the second year (M.Sc).  Why iGEM? IGEM is the chance to solve a global problem with methods of the synthetic biology. I am looking forward to meet young scientists from all over the world and make many new experiences. In our team, I supported the lab work as well as the wiki construction.
David Kelm
Age: 22
Studies: M. Sc. Informatik
I was asked to support the current iGEM-Team. In particular, the interdisciplinary direction and the fascinating possibilities that these technologies offer, appeal to me. This allows me to apply my acquired skills within this pratice oriented project and gain a number of new experiences. In my current studies I concentrate on the field of IT Security. Since I develop an Android interface and cooperate closely with the area of electrical engineering, this project unfortunatly does not offer any connections to my area of expertise.

I watched with interest the progression of last year’s TU Darmstadt iGEM-Team but could not participate due to time reasons. This year I would not want to miss working in the project since I want to apply and extend my experience in scientific research. In the course of my previous studies, I mainly specialized in research with mammalian cells but see great importance in having a deep insight in other and novel fields such as the manipulation of bacteria and the transfer to a engineering approach. Most of all, I am glad about how our student team works together in spite of having diverse knowledge in both different fields and different levels. We complement and bring forward one another and I am looking forward to coming across new experiences as well as challenges which make me also curious about how we are going to master them.

Hi! I am Dicky, 21years old and studying my bachelor of Molecular Biomedical Sciences in The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. I had exchanged to Germany and started my unforgettable life in Technische Universität Darmstadt (TUD) for half a year. The turning point during my exchange in Germany is joining iGEM in TUD. I joined the early stage of iGEM team in Hong Kong, so I know the difference of doing science between Hong Kong and Germany. My team was really having a fun time, enjoy the process and real life but not just focus on Lab work of iGEM. iGEM is a bridge that connects the people from the world. No matter where do we come from, we still can communicate with each other because we have the same language: Science.

Studies: M. Sc. Biomolecular Engineering
Why did I join the TU Darmstadt iGEM team? There are great people on the team, we’ve got an interesting topic, so no reason not to join in. I also liked the opportunity of finally doing my own research and working without only the prospect of good grades. iGEM is a true challenge where lots of interesting fields of work collide and you can learn while having fun. I’m really looking forward to when we can get started!
Laurin Monnheimer
Age: 23
Studies: B. Sc. Biology
In the first place, I learned about iGEM more or less coincidently but I soon figured out that this is a project I definitely want to be part of. The contest offers the unique opportunity to carry out research in a practically oriented manner and to meet scientific challenges as a team. Therefore, iGEM presents an outstanding occasion to gain new valuable experiences and to further develop my personal and scientific skills.   I hope that we as a project team will be successful in finding solid solutions to the problems we will be confronted with and I am highly motivated to make my personal contribution to iGEM.
Manuel Rebenich
Age: 26
Studies: Industrial Design
Hey guys... My name is Manuel and i'm studying my diploma in industrialdesign/Productdesign at the ""h-da"" University Darmstadt. Privatly I spend a lot of time in doing different art disciplines. I joined this year's iGEM-team because I like to get involved in an exciting project and to get contact to different facultys.  In the iGEM-project I'm responsible to give the hole project a smart visual character. I design Flyers, Posters and do a lot of graphic design in general. Additionally, I made designs for the shirts, Homepage and an early prototype of the device.
Sven Rumpf
Age: 23
Studies: Chemistry
I am studying Chemistry at the TU Darmstadt but I am also interested in molecular life sciences. Hence, I participate in iGEM to get a chance in working at a complex project with other students. I am pleased working with our team and learning from others.
Daniel Sachs
Age: 24
M. Sc. Biomolecular Engineering
This is the second time I participated in the iGEM competition. Of course nothing is like the first time,  still I'm very excited to be again part of the team. I tried to focus on the safety aspect of our application, since a only a safe device can someday leave the lab and change the world through Synthetic Biology. Someday  Synthetic Biology will make the world a better place and I'll be able to say: ""I was there!""
Christian Sator
I am studying Biomolecular Engineering at TU Darmstadt. I joined this year’s iGEM-team because I like the idea of tackling a complex issue together with a team and work out solutions for it. I think iGEM is a great opportunity to experience independent and interdisciplinary research and to broaden one’s mind. I’m looking forward to learn new stuff and meet lots of interesting people.
Anne Schieferdecker
Hey, my name is Anne and I am a student of the bachelor program Biomolecular Engineering at the TU Darmstadt. When I first heard about the 2012's iGEM project of our University, it was already too late to enter, but I knew that I will not miss the next project! The possibility to actively shape all aspects of a research project from conception through laboratory work and final presentation, is my primary motivation to participate. I also love challenges and look forward to every pebble along our way and the creative search for solutions by our fortunately heterogeneous team. Privately, I not only hope for fun and accumulating knowledge but also to develop in person.
Johanna Tüshaus
Age: 23
Studies: M. Sc. Biomolecular Engineering
During my studies abroad at the KTH in Stockholm I came to know iGEM for the first time. From the beginning the idea of the competition inspired me and encouraged me to join this year's iGEM-team of TU Darmstadt. I am looking forward to the tasks and challenges we are going to deal with during this intense period of time. I think all the members of the team are able to learn from each user and everyone can profit due to the interdisciplinary setting of our team.
Bastian Wagner
Studies: B. Sc. Biomolecular Engineering
Hi, my name is Bastian Wagner and I am a student of the bachelor program Biomolecular Engineering at the TU Darmstadt. The reason why I participate in iGEM is, because I like to design and construct new biological systems for useful purposes and create societal acceptance for this new technology. I also tried several new disciplines like coding and electrical engineering successfully.
Arne Wehling
Age: 22
Studies: B. Sc Biomolecular Engineering
Hey Guys! Currently I am finishing my B.Sc. in Biomolecular Engineering at the TU Darmstadt. With some friends I already started our university's first iGEM Team in 2012. Hence, I hope that our experiences will help us to get this year's competition done even better than before. I am in charge of oraganization and team management so I am some kind of a maid-of-all-work, if you want to put it like that.  I think that our team for 2013 is just great and fortunately we are quite interdisciplinaric, so I hope we learn a lot from each other and be successful during the following months full of working!
See you at the jamborees!
Jan Wintgens
Age: 24
Studies: M. Sc Biomolecular Engineering
The free and independent choice of work, the self motivational character and to have the responsibility for you and for your team were the main reasons why I joined iGEM. In contrast to all other uni projects there are only boundaries you set yourself, showing you where you have to set them especially in the lab! The competitions variety gives you the opportunity to work with people from other studies and in different fields yourself, which makes iGEM a true challange and helps you to discover new opportunities and overlapping fields for your studies. Being a member of this team gives you motivation and the will to learn more and to have fun with what you do.

The Team
This year’s iGEM team consists of 18 motivated students from the fields of biology, biomolecular engineering, chemistry, computer science, electrical engineering and industrial design. The Bachelor and Master students from various semesters are again supported by Professor Dr. Heribert Warzecha and Professor Dr. Jörg Simon. In 2012 the TU Darmstadt Team was a newcomer at the iGEM competition, receiving a Gold medal on the regional competition promptly. This year we will try to base our work on last year’s experiences and focus on improving our perfomance accordingly.
Kai Fenzl
Age: 21
Studies: B. Sc. Biomolecular Engineering
Since last year I want to be part of the iGEM-team, now in the 4th semester I have time for this challenge. I am responsible for the sponsoring of our team. I hope this projekt gives me the chance to learn new laborpractice and improve my softskills.  iGEM gives me the opportunity to see the activity of synthetic biologie, because I want to write my bachelor thesis in this field of science.  I am very greatful to be a part of this awesome team.

Hi! My name is Sven Jager, I am a Biomolecular Engineer in the second year (M.Sc).  Why iGEM? IGEM is the chance to solve a global problem with methods of the synthetic biology. I am looking forward to meet young scientists from all over the world and make many new experiences. In our team, I supported the lab work as well as the wiki construction.
David Kelm
Age: 22
Studies: M. Sc. Informatik
I was asked to support the current iGEM-Team. In particular, the interdisciplinary direction and the fascinating possibilities that these technologies offer, appeal to me. This allows me to apply my acquired skills within this pratice oriented project and gain a number of new experiences. In my current studies I concentrate on the field of IT Security. Since I develop an Android interface and cooperate closely with the area of electrical engineering, this project unfortunatly does not offer any connections to my area of expertise.

We divided the work in lab between us, so  everybody could get some experience while working on our project.
Wiki
Our Wiki was created by our computer  sciences student, Paweł. The content was mostly written by Anna with grammar  and spelling checking done by Paweł.
Theoretical  part
Most work on theoretical part was done by  Kasia. She’s the one that sacrificed herself and was buried under tones of  scientific articles.
Wetlab
Everyone worked at lab but the one who  spent the largest amount of time there is Tomek – without him we would never  make it. Also, special thanks to Anna, our PCR master and Zofia, who knows the  lab as nobody else.
Fundraising
Most of fundraising job was done by Anna & Anna, our special PR duet.
Human  practice
Everyone worked hard on publishing articles  in web and giving interviews. This time the main PR role was held by Anna and  Paweł.
Acknowledgements
Our special thanks go to:
Our instructors: Dr Robert  Czajkowski and Prof. Bogdan Banecki, for providing us with indispensable  knowledge
 
Intercollegiate Faculty of  Biotechnology University of Gdansk – Medical University of Gdansk – for  providing us with all the specialized equipment and lab space

Bobby Capps
I transferred from Oglethorpe University in 2011 as an English major and switched to Computer Science when I arrived at GSU. I am now a Neuroscience major and joined IGEM this spring to get some research experience. Since then I have been building this lovely website and keeping mealworms and fish. I hope to graduate within the next year and enroll in a graduate program for computational neuroethology.
Tyrel Heckendorf
Tyrel enjoys sitting and staring at colors.  There is controversy as to his exact origins, yet it is rumored by scholars that he comes from ancient Sumer.  His age is unknown.  He spends most of his time researching the paranormal, from aliens to psychic phenomenon, though it is known that some days he can be found in a tree or under a bridge.  His favorite animal is his pet Chimera, but gets annoyed at the amount of human sacrifices it needs.  Majoring in physics with a concentration in biophysics, he hopes to follow his idol Dr. Frankenstein.
Reza Alavi
My goal is to get into medical school after finishing my BS in biology.  I am the current member and officer of American Medical Student Association at Georgia State University (AMSA GSU) and also member of Tri-Beta Honor society.  Some of the main activates I have done are shadowing Emory Orthopedics department’s surgery supervised by Dr. Moore and volunteer at Grady Hospital.  My passion to human study and nature of living cells made me to choose biology as my undergraduate major.  I have been fortunate to participate in the iGEM research project supervised by Dr. Brewer at Georgia State University.
Dafna Lapidot
My name is Dafna and I am a psychology major and chemistry minor. I am a senior, and am applying for medical schools. My ultimate goal is to become a neurologist. Originally I am from Israel, but have been living in the United States for almost ten years. I served in the Israeli Defense Forces for two years following my high school graduation. I have been part of the iGEM lab since last summer (June 2012). My main focus is the research side of the project, however, occasionally I do some wet lab work.
Alisha Morgan
Hello everyone, my name is Alisha Morgan and I am a biology major. Call me crazy but I LOVE it. I have a guinea pig named Leo and all he does is squeal for his veggies or hay. I'm a huge NY Giants fan but can't get enough of high heels. Anywho, once I'm completely done with school I plan on becoming an OB/GYN. I've been dreaming about this since I could remember and I know that God makes all things possible.
Blake Cherney
My name is Blake Cherney and I joined the Igem lab last semester as an undergraduate student. I hope to start my masters degree this upcoming fall. I will be concentrating on applied environmental microbiology as well as working on a project investigating the symbiotic relationship between Acanthamoeba castellanii and other organisms.
Merhawi Yigzaw
This sovereign leader of our lab, he has survived everything from the common cold to usurpation. An Adonis of a man, it was once said that while he was sailing around the world, he found a shortcut. He has also killed two stones with one bird. Our fearless leader has established a new golden age for synthetic biology through increased funds and an increase in new members. A member of the legendary Chicken & Wiffles competitive wiffle ball team, he once threw a perfect game and hit for the cycle in the same game. Having him in our lab has not only been an honor but our extreme pleasure. Although time waits for no one, it seems to wait for him. His last year with the iGEM team, he will be sorely missed.
Lydia Studdard
I am a senior biology major and am currently applying to Ph.D. programs in microbiology and immunology. I am specifically interested in studying viruses and their pathenogenesis. After graduate school, I hope to continue doing research while teaching at the collegiate level. The research experience I have gained from iGEM has substantiated my desire to ‘boldly go where no one has gone before’ in the magical world of microorganisms.  In addition to my love for biology, I am also a voracious reader of classical mysteries. I am proud to have read every Agatha Christie novel as well as her autobiography.
Nouman Tanveer
In the spring of 1991, a baby was born in the mountains of Punjab, Pakistan. Named Nouman Tanveer by his grandfather; Nouman started going to school when he was only three years old. His mother saw his future when he came 1st in third grade. She was a highly educated, brilliant woman who started teaching Nouman the rules of algebra, physics and biology when he was only 8 years old. In grade 10 he set the record for highest marks in board exams in his district and came to U.S to study medicine and become an Invasive Cardiovascular Surgeon. He is finishing his B.Sc. in Biology at Georgia State University this year and plans on going to Georgetown School of Medicine next year.
Kristin VanMouwerik
Kristin is currently taking Chemistry and Biology classes at Georgia State University with the hopes of getting into Pharmaceutical Research and Development. She enjoys working in the labs and spends more time there than anywhere else on campus. She received a Bachelor of Arts in Music from Guilford College but a tragic accident involving her partner caused her to reevaluate her goals and ambitions. While spending three gruesome days and nights by his hospital bedside, she decided that a career in medicine would allow her to directly improve the lives of more people than music.

Title Goes Here
Students
Vincent Leonardo
Vincent is amazing, he radiates positivity and he has a black belt at being good in everything from cooking delicious food to excellent lab skills. Also, Vincent is like a ""Wikipedia of genetics"", if anyone has a question about it, he is the person who will give great advice about it. In his free time Vincent gives brilliant piano lessons, and plays it beautifully himself, also dreams of being a GREAT king in the future. Furthermore, he has an amazing 30 pairs of shoes collection, which would be enough for 3 iGEM teams! Recently, during iGEM, Vincent become proud and loving father of Betty and Bertie (the first L-forms he grew on a streak plate).
James King
If you need help modelling, James is the guy you need to talk to. James is a second year Geneticist who hopes to work in bioinformatics in the future. This chirpy chappy has a passion for cooking and has treated certain iGEMers to his delectable risotto. When not working on iGEM or cooking fabulous food you will find James at the university squash courts with friends.
Yana Dem'yanenko
A trampolining, opera-watching, guitar-and-sometimes-piano-playing, dangerous-cyclling, wine-drinking, cheese-eating, gourmet chef – Yana also sometimes works on iGEM.
Matthew Law
As one of the two computer scientists on the team, Matt has been vital to the design and production of our wiki. Matt has also cheerfully immersed himself in the labwork. Matts main computing interests are game design and bio-informatics. Outside academia, Matt enjoys playing and coaching basketball and is president of the University basketball club.
Vivian Wong
Vivian studies Pharmacology and is from Hong Kong. She’s a dedicated member of the team, often working late into the evening. As well as her competence with practical lab work, she is quietly confident in many aspects of the project such as navigating the wiki and having design input. Although first seen as a little shy, Vivian quickly came out of her shell, giving excellent advice and listening and responding to problems or concerns. In her spare time she enjoys playing the piano, eating out and enjoying a good cup of tea.
Christopher Wall
Studying in the first Synthetic Biology Masters in the country (alongside Rob), Chris completed a BSc in Biology at the University of Sheffield before moving to Newcastle.  As one of the more experienced members of the team, Chris' extensive lab skills and resourcefulness have made him the first person other members turn to when an experiment goes wrong or a protocol needs adjusting. Found in the lab at weekends and late into the night, Chris' enthusiasm and maturity have enabled him to successfully juggle iGEM with the end of his Masters project. When not in the lab, Chris can be found playing or watching football, and is also something of a movie aficionado.
Justas Miknys
Justas is one of our computer scientists in the team and provides a lot of help with the computing and modelling parts of our project. Even though he doesn’t have much background in biology, he tries his best to help us all the time. Justas has a signature laugh which cheers everyone up after a long day. Throughout the day, he also likes to share haribos and cookies with everyone on the team to keep everyone full. If you see Justas really tired in the morning, it’s probably because he has been up at night playing poker. Justas suggested that our iGEM team be called Newcastle Mafia. This name was luckily voted out but he was devastated.
Alina Tamciuc
Alina is our only architect in the team but has thrown herself into the lab work with lots of enthusiasm. Her strengths are in her strong eye for design (as seen in the team logo), her straight talking attitude and supportive and friendly nature. She also enjoys hikes, cheese, wine, watching Miss Marple, cherry tea, trips to the cinema and photography.
Robert McKiernan
Rob is one of the first two people in the UK to study Synthetic Biology and prior to this he studied Cellular and Molecular Biology. He has a love of travelling, having visited 22 countries so far where he has enjoyed a wide range of experiences, from climbing to Everest base camp, to sky diving in New Zealand. He is often sighted in blur form as he skates frantically everywhere possible and he goes snowboarding whenever the chance arises. He achieved distinction in grade 8 saxophone and above all else, has a full beard!
Isabelle McLaren
Izzy is a 3rd year Biomedical Science student and is often seen helping out in the lab. She is very cheerful and lightens up the mood for everyone in the lab. Izzy is very efficient and completes tasks she is set to do quickly and accurately. When expressing her views, she is often straightforward but at the same time also listens to others member’s opinion to reach the best possible alternative while confronting a problem. While waiting for things to incubate, you can always see Izzy reading a book whilst drinking a cup of tea outside the lab. In her spare time, she also enjoys being at the beach and trying out different types of cuisine with other members of the team.
Geoffrey Pettitt
A softly spoken, contemplative chap, Geoff brings a more reflective quality to the team. his flexibility has allowed seamless movement between themes, with Geoff equally comfortable growing and experimenting on his plants or modelling the L-forms growing in them. A keen hiker, he is the vice-president of the university's fellwalking society.
Supervisors and Advisors
Prof. Anil Wipat
I am the degree programme director for the MSc Bioinformatics and Computational Systems Biology at Newcastle University.  My research interests are focussed on integrative bioinformatics, systems and synthetic biology. My group researches strategies for data integration in bioinformatics at various levels from the local integration of 'omics' datasets as probabilistic integrated functional networks, through to the integration of remote heterogeneous databases (ONDEX).  My group are investigating approaches to facilitate an integrative and systems approach to biology, with a particular emphasis on ageing and nutrition, as part of the BBSRC/EPSRC funded Newcastle Centre for the Integrative and Systems Biology of Ageing and Nutrition (CISBAN). Methods for model annotation by data integration have been developed as part of the SAINT project.   The group also researches and develops e-Science and Cloud computing technology to tackle problems in biological data analysis, simulation, and integration, and are interested in how the biological sciences can, in turn, drive developments in computing science. In particular, the group is developing technology for data integration, computational modelling and comparative genomics (e.g. Microbase).  I also researches computational design strategies for Synthetic Biology, with a focus on the role of modelling and data integration in the design of biological systems. Laboratory facilities have been estalished in collaboration with the Centre for Bacterial Cell Biology allowing computational designs to be tested in-vivo.   The biological applications of his research are quite diverse ranging from microbiology and metagenomics, through to the mechanisms of human genetic disease and ageing. Traditionally the group has a strong interest and background in microbial genomics and functional genomics particularly for Gram-positive microorganisms such as Bacillus and relatives.
Dr. Paolo Zuliani
I am a Lecturer (Assistant Professor) in the School of Computing Science at Newcastle University. My current research area is verification of biological and cyber-physical systems via model checking. I work with Anil Wipat and his group at the Center for Bacterial Cell Biology, in particular for verifying synthetic biology designs. Earlier, I worked with Edmund M. Clarke at Carnegie Mellon University, where I was the Technical Coordinator of CMACS. I am also interested in quantum and reversible programming languages, and formal methods for specifying and deriving code (a la Dijkstra) for quantum algorithms. For information visit: [http://www.ncl.ac.uk/computing/people/profile/paolo.zuliani Dr. Paolo Zuliani].
Dr. Wendy Smith
I am a research associate based in our wet lab in the Centre for Bacterial Cell Biology, Newcastle University. I studied Medical Microbiology at Newcastle University and my PhD was analysing functional genomics of group A streptococcal virulence factors.  My initial research involved investigating the mechanisms of pathogenicity utilized by the Gram positive bacteria Streptococcus pyogenes. This experience equipped me with considerable expertise in the physiology/molecular biology of Gram-positive bacteria.  I first encountered the concept of synthetic biology (at local seminars) in the context of a Gram-positive bacterium (Bacillus subtilis) and my interest stemmed initially from recognizing that this was a completely new and ‘exciting’ area, where I could make a valuable contribution exploiting my existing expertise.  I have now extended my interests into the field of synthetic biology and am specifically researching into synthetic quorum peptide mediated communication systems in Bacillus subtilis.
Dr. Jem Stach
Principal research interests include the ecology of marine actinomycetes, (diversity, abundance and biogeography), novel natural products from marine actinomycetes, the application of peptide nucleic acids in species-specific bactericide and the development of antisense-based antibacterial screens
Owen Gilfellon
1st year PhD student, studying Computer Intelligence applied to the engineering of Bacillus subtilis, in association with Microsoft Research, Cambridge.  Current Synthetic Biology designs are generally small scale and produced manually, using large amounts of specific domain knowledge. The development of automated computational tools that utilise Computer Intelligence has the potential to extend the scale of possible designs, providing the framework for genome-scale engineering.  Work on the automated design of simple devices will be the basis for research into the full or partial automation of the full Synthetic Biology process. Important to this will be investigating the role of programming languages in defining high-level design specifications, how they can best abstract the complexity of the underlying biology, and how they can usefully incorporate computer intelligence algorithms and representations of genetic parts.
Sarah Shapiro

Sungshic Park
I am a PhD student in synthetic biology. At crossroads between molecular biology and engineering, synthetic biology is a science trying to crack the code of life by building it. I want to understand how DNA governs many facets of biological life forms from microscopic regulations at the cellular level to such macroscopic phenomena as senescence, cancer, intelligence and self-awareness. I want to pursue research on building cellular machineries that can perform “simple” defined tasks. Ultimately, I want to design a framework genome that would serve as a platform for programming microbes or cellular machines.  In fact, building such a synthetic genome is a reality still far into the future. Currently, I am set out for an interim research goal: given a mathematical model of a synthetic genetic circuit, determine the what and how of in vivo measurements in terms of resolving discrepancies between the model and the world. This research calls for other enabling studies such as microfluidics, molecular quantification and directed evolution. I have background both in computing and biochemistry. I have worked on various projects involving robotics, artificial intelligence, process control, neural cell recording, animal behaviour measurement and molecular biology. Some of the species worked on include UNIX posix, Linux ubuntu, MacOS leopard, Windows seven, Rattus norvegicus (rodent), Macaca radiata (macaque), Escherichia coli, Clostridium difficile and Bacillus subtilis.
Dr. Ling Juan Wu
I am a senior research associate in the Centre for Bacterial Cell Biology, Newcastle University. I did my undergraduate and Master Degrees in China. I entered the world of bacterial chromosome segregation when I did my PhD project at Oxford University with Jeff Errington. Understanding the process of chromosome segregation and how it is coordinated with cell division in Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus subtilis remain my main research interests. Currently my work focuses on chromosome behaviour in B. subtilis L-forms and its application in synthetic biology.

Minghao Pan
I had prepared words to summary our team, quoting Mrs Hilary: Although we weren't able to shatter that highest, hardest glass ceiling this time, thanks to you, it's got about some cracks in it. And the light is shining through like never before, filling us all with the hope and the sure knowledge that the path will be a little easier next time. That has always been the history of progress in iGEM.  But can we claim that feeling no shame and embrace the results? Definitely no! Laziness, distraction and lack of orderliness were always killing us through the whole process, and we deserve the results. I wish we could become someone graceful and platonic.
Zhang Heng

As long as there is a chance to see the tip of the iceberg, it doesn't matter how many test tubes I am going to break.
Cao Qinjingwen
Excellent! Without these kinds of words, how can I say anything to describe her? As our elder sister, she always gives us self-confident, hey soul sister!
Xiao Zhuyun
Sincere and straightforward, ""piggy"", the curve wrecker in our eyes, puts all her efforts into research and study. Only when you get close to her, will you find that she also loves to play, that she also loves life.
Zeyu Wang
Although I was a freshman and initially came to USTC iGEM , I did some experiment in molecular cloning.I took part in human practice and  wiki writing.I also helped with presentation. Thank you，USTC iGEMers!
Han Yingying
Tender as a new-born kitty, Yingying doesn't like to stand in the spotlight. She's a diligent brain instead of a silken tongue. We believe that gold will shine no matter where it is.
Sijia Fan
Black humorist, and sadly, the leader is always shouting at me:"" Hurry! Hurry!"".

Jiong Hong
I am applying this strategy on the mechanism of the complex diseases such as cancer and diabetes. My ongoing project is to identify biomarkers in order to detect the progress stages of the diabetes. In addition, I have planed to analyze the genetic and environmental factors and their interactions during the progressing of the type 2 diabetes with systems-biology approaches.
Jiarui Wu
Since the research strategy of systems biology is well fit to analyze the biological complex systems. I am applying this strategy on the mechanism of the complex diseases such as cancer and diabetes. We have developed systematic approaches based on proteomics and bioinformatics to analyze human normal and diabetic serum.

Students
Vincent Leonardo
Vincent is amazing, he radiates positivity and he has a black belt at being good in everything from cooking delicious food to excellent lab skills. Also, Vincent is like a ""Wikipedia of genetics"", if anyone has a question about it, he is the person who will give great advice about it. In his free time Vincent gives brilliant piano lessons, and plays it beautifully himself, also dreams of being a GREAT king in the future. Furthermore, he has an amazing 30 pairs of shoes collection, which would be enough for 3
iGEM teams! Recently, during iGEM, Vincent become proud and loving father of Betty and Bertie (the first L-forms he grew on a streak plate).
James King
If you need help modelling, James is the guy you need to talk to. James is a second year Geneticist who hopes to work in bioinformatics in the future. This chirpy chappy has a passion for cooking and has treated certain iGEMers to his delectable risotto. When not working on iGEM or cooking fabulous food you will find James at the university squash courts with friends.
Yana Dem'yanenko
A trampolining, opera-watching, guitar-and-sometimes-piano-playing, dangerous-cyclling, wine-drinking, cheese-eating, gourmet chef – Yana also sometimes works on iGEM.
Matthew Law
As one of the two computer scientists on the team, Matt has been vital to the design and production of our wiki. Matt has also cheerfully immersed himself in the labwork. Matts main computing interests are game design and bio-informatics. Outside academia, Matt enjoys playing and coaching basketball and is president of the University basketball club.
Vivian Wong
Vivian studies Pharmacology and is from Hong Kong. She’s a dedicated member of the team, often working late into the evening. As well as her competence with practical lab work, she is quietly confident in many aspects of the project such as navigating the wiki and having design input. Although first seen as a little shy, Vivian quickly came out of her shell, giving excellent advice and listening and responding to problems or concerns. In her spare time she enjoys playing the piano, eating out and enjoying a good cup of tea.
Christopher Wall
Studying in the first Synthetic Biology Masters in the country (alongside Rob), Chris completed a BSc in Biology at the University of Sheffield before moving to Newcastle.  As one of the more experienced members of the team, Chris' extensive lab skills and resourcefulness have made him the first person other members turn to when an experiment goes wrong or a protocol needs adjusting. Found in the lab at weekends and late into the night, Chris' enthusiasm and maturity have enabled him to successfully juggle iGEM with the end of his Masters project. When not in the lab, Chris can be found playing or watching football, and is also something of a movie aficionado.

In the last two months,thanks to our devotion and the support of various professors and scientific institutions ,our team achieved proud results.
In the summer vacation,we  used  the gene material donated by scientific institutions and individuals to  standardize and splice.we standardized and spliced transdermal peptide  and gene circuits consists of various fusion protein of antigen.Meanwhile,we expressed TD1-GFP、TD1-HBsAg、TD1-LTB and all of expression of them was verified by in the E.coli. TD1-PA、TD1-HBsAg、TD1-Ag85b and TD1-LTB constructed circuits of the secretion vector,WB800N.Firstly,the transdermal experiment outside human body succeeded.Secondly,we also try to do experiment in living mice.Generally,we construct 16 new parts,we set a foundation for toolkit.Also our standardized BBa_K1074006 set a frame for other secretion expression researchers,theoretically users can use TD1 to merge any protein,to made the target protein have the function of secretion and transdermal permeation.
Thanks to the following individuals and institutions:
1.Gene donation
Standardized antigen:Chinese Centre for Disease
TD-1 short chain poly peptide:Professor Longping Wen
2.Theoretically support:
Consultation of Bacillus subtilis:Professor Xin Run,Nanjing Agriculture University
Consultation of transdermal  experiment:Professor Longping Wen
Training of mice experiment:Professor Ting Yue
3.Preliminary Partner:Hualan Biology Co.,ltd.

Here's a little bit about us
Queen's University is located in Kingston, Ontario, a beautiful limestone city which was Canada's first capital. Their iGEM team is composed of dedicated students who have devoted their summer to working with synthetic biology, toiling away in labs, promoting the field to others through outreach, and having a blast along the way. Our project this year initially began as an idea to remove foot odour. It eventually evolved to a much broader idea involving mosquitoes, malaria, and smelly feet! To find out more about what we've been up to, click over to our Project and Parts pages!

Meet the Team
HENRY BARRON
Henry is a third-year student studying Life Sciences. He dreams of a future that is inspiring and exciting. He also loves art but can't draw or paint. These two things have led him to synthetic biology.
JAMES KIM
James is a second-year student studying Life Sciences. As a scholar, gentleman as well as a boxer, you can likely find him holding doors open for damsels, pondering the mysteries of the universe, and performing spartan pushups (yes, they are as difficult as they sound).
MACKENZIE JAMIESON
Mack is a fourth-year Life Sciences student. His spirit animal is the dragon because his smouldering eyes could probably burn anyone to a crisp. His commitment to toned biceps is matched only by his love for synthetic biology, the canvas upon which he paints with powerful strokes of genius.
SYLVESTER CHIANG
Sylvester is a third-year student studying Biomedical Computing. He is aptly described as a combination of his predecessors, Sylvester the cat and Sylvester Stallone, an individual of persistence and impressive muscular structure.
CINDY ZHU
Cindy is a fourth-year Life Sciences and Psychology student. She is excited to join iGEM due to the infinite possibilities of synthetic biology, and to contribute to both labwork and creative projects. In her spare time, she enjoys reading Oliver Sacks, Youtubing Broadway musicals, and sangria.
DYLAN PIETTE
Dylan entering his fourth-year in the Biochemistry program. He really enjoys building orphanages in third-world countries, raising money for the donation of livestock and when it all gets too much, Dylan will kick back in his lawn chair and work on his children's novel.
SIMON HUANG
Simon is a fourth-year Life Science student. Much like Charlie Sheen, it is very difficult to find him not winning. When he isn’t exploring the wonders of synthetic biology, he secretly trains to be a Tetris pro.
MITANGI PAREKH
Mitangi Parekh is going into her fifth-year of Biology and English and is ridiculously excited to be back with QGEM for yet another summer. Her passions include writing and drinking copious amounts of iced coffee. She also has a special bond with huskies; in a remote village in Siberia, she is known as The Husky Whisperer.
TONY ZHU
Tony is going into third year of Life Sciences at Queen's. He's allergic to mangoes but he eats them anyways.
STEPHANIE CHAN
Stephanie blends in with the high schoolers, but in reality she is a third-year Life Sciences student. When not doing plasmid preps or running PCR gels, Steph can be found in her natural habitat, Stauffer, battling her MCAT books. She is also a keen curator of cute cat captions.
ANDY SONG
Andy is entering his fourth-year as a Life Sciences major and hails from Nova Scotia, a land famous for Keith's and copious amounts of salt water. He enjoys playing sports, hanging out with friends, and playing Settlers of Catan. His academic interests include GI cell physiology, saccade movements, and of course synthetic biology.
KYLE SUNDERLAND
Kyle is entering his third-year in the Biomedical Computing program at Queen's. With a strong interest in Neuroscience and prosthetic limbs, he figured iGEM would be a great way to combine his interests of biology and computing together. He hasn't looked back since.
LAURA CHU
Laura is entering her third year of Life Sciences. She loves cooking, reading, and watching a good old Leafs game. She loves heavy metal music and has recently developed an addiction to Benedict Cumberbatch's cheekbones. She can often be found daydreaming about her next meal.
MADDY TONG
Maddy is entering her third year in the Life Sciences program. Her days are often spent on the computer playing video games, working with Photoshop, and browsing aimlessly on websites. She also enjoys cooking, eating, and pipetting things in the lab.

All of the work that was done during this project was both planned and executed by our iGEM team members. It all started of with some brainstorming sessions that began in the middle of May, although the actual lab work began in the beginning of June.
During the summer we have worked very closely with the Linköpings iGEM team 2013 . Since it was their first year to participate in the competition we decided to do our best to provide them with any assistance they needed, such as providing them with parts, knowledge etc.
In addition to assisting Linköpings iGEM team we have also sent biobricks to the following iGEM teams:

A special thanks
We would also like to thank other sources that have helped us, such as the Slovenian iGEM team 2010 that supplied us with the genes needed for the production of carotenoid metabolites, TU-Munichs iGEM team 2012 that provided us with the gene 4CL for the production of 4-coumaryl-CoA, and Wahington University's 2012 iGEM team WashU that enabled our work with the saffron pathway. Last but not least we would also like to thank the School of chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, Cornell University for providing us with the genes involved in the production of the phenylpropanoid pathway. The article can be found at; Conrado RJ, Mori J et al (2011)
Other collaborations
In addition to this we would also like to mention some fascinating requests that have been made by external sources:
Nature reviews request to display our chromoproteins on their front page for their 10 year anniversary.
National Aeronautics and Space Administrations (NASA) biotechnology department requested our chromoproteins as reporter genes for a project that is currently being worked on.

Team iGEM Uppsala 2013
Team Uppsala iGEM is competing for the fifth consecutive year. This time we are a group of 26 under and overgraduate students in the fields of biotechnology and microbiology. We study at Uppsala University and it’s academic sister Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences. Both are located in Uppsala, once the capital of Sweden and center of norse religion; and today home to the oldest university in scandinavia and a big life science cluster. Our lab is located at Uppsala Biomedical Center.
Because we are a large team we have decided to divide ourselves into three groups. Two groups have focused on metabolic engineering and one group focused on creating a new probiotic chassi.

Evolution of the iGEM Team Frankfurt
Our Team startet to search for a suitable project for the iGEM 2013 competition in October 2012. First we screened former iGEM Wikis for interesting but incompleted ideas and held in mind our project ideas as well as the final subject from the previous year. Some of us informed theirselves and developed their own ideas and presented the topics to the rest of us for an open discussion. Each of this discussions came along with small lectures about important methods in molecular biology, since the teammembers are from different scientific disciplines including biophysics, biochemistry, biotechnology, biology and bioinformatics. Thus we've had many different inputs for new ideas and things to teach each other. After having abandoned several ideas (including luminescent plants, bacteria-produced biofilms and de novo in vivo synthesis) due to practical and time issues pursuing these plans, we remembered that if there's a fundament, we can just as well build a house on top of it. For this reason, we decided in spring 2013 to not only go back to the steviol topic from 2012 but also to solve previous problems and to dig deeper into the subject.
For creative and professional assistance we could rely really fast on our previous mentors but also got new assistance by contacting several group leaders and professors on our university. After laboratory space was provided and financial possibilities were given, we've been able to sum up our previous work and give the go-ahead for this year's project.

The team
Our team is composed of students from L3 (3rd year after baccalaureate) to M2 (5th year after baccalaureate) from various scientific backgrounds: biology, pharmacy, computer science, ethics...
We worked from mid-june to mid-october, some full time, some part time.
Lab work
Lab work (cloning and Tecan analysis) was done by the team in Institute of Systems & Synthetic Biology , Evry. Our supervisors Andrew Tolonen and Nicolas Pollet gave us advice on cloning strategy and results analysis throughout the project.
Plasmids
Plasmids were provided by our advisor Cyrille Pauthenier and his former trainee Quentin Viautour.
Microfluidic
Microfluidic chip design and mould were made by Boris Kirov, former member of the iSSB.
Microfluidic experiments were made under the supervision of Shensi Shen, actual member of the iSSB.
Homologous recombination protocol
Homologous recombination protocol for ΔFur strain was provided by Hafez El-Sayyed, former member of the iSSB.
Scientific seminar
The scientific conference and the survey were organised by member of the team with the help of Julien Picot and Veronique le Boulch (members of the Genopole).
Survey
The survey redaction and analysis were done by the member of the team. Patients associations help us to spread our survey to the patients.
Wiki
We make the style and content of the wiki by ourselves. The few images that do not belong to us are clearly attribuated.
Funding
The team did most of the fundraising work: creating a sponsoring file, contacting potential sponsors and presenting the project. We managed the money ourselves, through Genopole and through a ""1901 French law"" association. Genopole supported our project, paying inscription and Regional Jamboree participation fees, as well as donating 10000 euros towards the project. Evry university contributed 6000 euros, Agglomération d'Evry 3000 euros, ENSIIE 1500 euros, SupBiotech 1500 euros, the French embassy in the United States donated 1500 euros and CNS gave 88 euros. Our other sponsors helped us by providing us with machine (Genoscope),discounts or free samples (Corning, Macherey-Nagel, Duran Group, Geneious, Sigma-Aldrich).

Notre équipe est composée d'étudiants de Licence 3 (Bac +3) à Master 2 (Bac +5) de divers horizons scientifiques: biologie, pharmacie, informatique, éthique ...
Nous avons travaillé de mi-juin à mi-octobre, certains à temps plein et d’autres à temps partiel.
Financement
L'essentiel du travail de l'équipe dans la recherche de subventions a été : la création d'un fichier de sponsoring, la prise de contact des sponsors potentiels et la présentation de notre projet. Nous avons géré les financements nous-mêmes, à travers le Genopole et grâce à une association 1901.
Le Genopole a soutenu notre projet, en payant notre inscription et nos frais de participation à la Jamboree régionale, ainsi qu’en donnant 10 000 € pour le projet. L’université d'Evry a contribué à hauteur de 6000 €, l’Agglomération d'Evry de 3000 €, l'ENSIIE de 1500 €, SupBiotech de 1500 €, l'ambassade française aux États-Unis à fait don de 1500 euros et le CNS a donné 88 €.
D’autres sponsors nous ont aidés autrement. En nous prêtant des machines (Genoscope), en nous octroyant des réductions ou en nous donnant du matériel (Corning, Macherey-Nagel, Duran Group, Geneious, Sigma-Aldrich).
Le travail en laboratoire
Nos travaux Pratiques (clonages et analyses Tecan) ont été réalisés par l'équipe à l’ISSB (Institute of Systems & Synthetic Biology) à Evry. Nos superviseurs Andrew Tolonen et Nicolas Pollet nous ont conseillés sur la stratégie de clonage et sur les analyses des résultats tout le long du projet.
Les plasmides
Les plasmides ont été fournis par notre advisor : Cyrille Pauthenier.
La Microfluidique
La conception des puces microfluidiques et les moules ont été faites par Boris Kirov, ancien membre de l’ISSB.
Les expériences de microfluidiques ont été faites sous la supervision de Chen-si Shen, membre effectif de l’ISSB.
Protocole de recombinaison homologue
Le protocole de recombinaison homologue de la souche ΔFur a été fourni par Hafez El-Sayyed, ancien membre de l’ISSB.
Conférence scientifique et enquête
L'enquête et la conférence sur l’hémochromatose ont été organisées par les membres de l'équipe avec l'aide de Julien Picot et Véronique Le Boulch (membres du Génopole).

William Rostain
PhD Student in Alfonso Jaramillo's group, iSSB
William is a PhD student in the Synth-Bio team of iSSB, Evry University. He is developing synthetic RNA circuits using computational methods. William discovered synthetic biology through his participation in the Edinburgh 2010 and Evry 2012 teams, and is advising the 2013 Evry team.
Cyrille Pauthenier
PhD Student in Jean-Loup Faulon's group, iSSB, École Normale Supérieure alumni
Cyrille participated the iGEM competition twice, in 2011 with Paris Bettencourt's team (Nanotube's project, semi-final finalist) and 2012 Evry team (French froggies project, Best Model and Best Human Practice in the semi-final) in which he helped founding with William Rostain and Tristan Cerisy. Chemist by training and alumni of the École Normale Supérieure he is currently doing a PhD thesis in metabolic engineering on yeast at Jean-Loup Faulon's group , in the institute of System and Synthetic Biology in France.
Tristan Cerisy
Master SSB (2012), Université d'Evry
PhD student, Genoscope , Université d'Evry
After my bachelor in Bioinformatics, I did the Master Systems and Synthetic Biology at the University of Evry. During the master, William and I decided to create the iGEM Evry team in November 2011, quickly joined by Cyrille. One year after the iGEM Evry team (with 15 people) got 2 prices in Amsterdam (Best Model and Best Human Practices Advance) and was qualified for the final in Boston! Now I am beginning a PhD in environmental systems biology. I study the degradation of cellulose and hemicellulose by Clostridium phytofermentans in the French Sequencing Center under the supervision of Andrew Tolonen .
Pierre Parutto
Master2 Bioinformatics and Modeling student - UPMC Paris
As a retired modeler of the 2012 Evry team, I accumulated some experience on how to build models for biological systems. After graduating from the engineering school EPITA and an internship in metabolic network modeling in the BioRetroSynth group, I decided to do a master in bioinformatics from the UPMC university. I followed this year's project because it provides interesting challenges with the use of different modeling methods(FBA, ODE, probabilitiy) at different scales - the same kind of problems we faced last year. As a good IGEM fellow, I wanted to share my skills and pursue the Evry modeling immemorial tradition with the 2013 IGEM modelers in order to guide them through the harsh and merciless world of modeling of biological systems.

Collaboration. Fun Interactions Between iGEM Teams!
Cooperation with the iGEM Team Freiburg
We got to know the Freiburg iGEM team during the Biotechnology 2020+ conference in Berlin, where several teams from Germany presented their projects and were offered the opportunity to gather around, discuss and share experiences in the lab. Since we talked with the Freiburg team about our first experiences in the lab, we noticed that our two projects have something in common: the GibsonAssembly.  That was the start of our cooperation.
The iGEM team Freiburg had already successfully conducted several Gibson Cloning attempts and was able to establish a well working protocol. They offered to realize a little workshop with us so we could improve our knowledge about Gibson Cloning and the practical implementation. On the other hand Freiburg had problems with the CHO cells they were working with for the realization of their project. As the Bioquant is in close connection with the German Cancer Research Center we managed to organise the urgently needed CHO-Pro5 to help Freiburg.
On July 15, 2013 Natalie, Fenja and Michael arrived in Heidelberg and we met in our laboratory in the BioQuant. After a short introduction of our team and the three team-members from Freiburg, we directly started with the Gibson Assembly. Together we worked 3 hours on the theoretical and practical introduction of Gibson Cloning. We managed to successfully assemble and transform their constructs and had positive results on the next day.
Of course the fun was not missed out. During a team-dinner we got to know Natalie, Fenja and Michael better and had good discussions about several similarities in the iGEM-teams like team compositions, how to embellish the long hours in the lab and general experiences we gained in the competition.
It was not only a great collaboration, but we also had a lot of fun and are very grateful for having gotten to know the iGEM team Freiburg better. We want to thank Freiburg for their help and are very much looking forward to a great time and new experiences in Lyon together.
Collecting Soil Samples for iGEM Team Norwich
As the iGEM team of Norwich worked with the bacteria ''Streptomyces'', which can be found in soil, they wanted to collect samples from all over the world. We found their project very interesting as 'Streptomyces' are an essential organism in our indigoidine project as well. Thus we went to the forest and dug little holes at a couple of different places to collect soil in falcon tubes. All samples were labelled with date, location etc. and send to them for further analysis. It was a lot of fun and a good reason to get out of the lab and into the nature. We hope that the team Norwich could make use of the samples and discovered many interesting specimens in our Heidelberg soil.
Feedback for iGEM Team Purdue
The iGEM Team of Purdue University invited us to support their project by giving input for their plan to create a new standard for biobrick submission, which should lead to more qualitative biobricks. We were glad to help by for example providing our opinion by filling out their survey. Furthermore within a video conference we talked about the ideas of the team and how we think about them, how they would fit to our own needs and how they could implement them. We hope that our reviews were useful to them.

iGEM Team Heidelberg 2013
Ilia Kats
One of our team members, the secret nerd in chief of our group, Ilia Kats, had the initial idea for our project and inspired all of us with his dream of easy and efficient recycling of gold. He also came up with the concept to exploit the NRPS modularity for setting up the NRPSDesigner.
Besides all of his brainwork, Ilia was indispensable for all of the wetlab work for the different subprojects. He was single-handedly responsible for the cloning the methylmalonyl-CoA patwhay for the delftibactin project. In the synthetic peptides, the indigoidine-tag and tag-optimization subproject, he was involved in the pilot experiments. And last but not least, his programming skills were essential for the successfull implementation of our NRPSDesigner software where he used his supernatural force to eliminate even the toughest bugs.
A big THANK U from the whole team for the inspiration and great humor.
Synthetic Peptides
The main focus of this project was to demonstrate the feasibility of NRPS module shuffling, performed by Joshua Sachs, Philipp Walch, Tania Christiansen and Anja Riedel. They established the experimental strategy and designed all corresponding primers needed for the amplification of the different tyrocidine modules. Tania Christiansen was especially responsible for the BioBrick submission and the cloning of the fragments into the needed RFCs.
Another essential part in the synthetic peptides subproject was the mass spectrometry, which Joshua Sachs was in charge of. Everyone in this group contributed to the great success of this part of the project! Here, we want to thank our advisor Lorenz Adlung, who helped us with his great experience he shared in frequent lab-meeting discussions.
Indigoidine-Tag
The indigoidine-tag subproject was about developing an easily detectable, inert and universal tag for NRPs. The work on the module-chains comprising fusion peptides from the tyrocidine cluster were performed by Joshua Sachs, Philipp Walch, Tania Christiansen and Anja Riedel. Philipp Walch and Joshua Sachs performed the valine-indigoidine as well as the di- and tripeptide-indigoidine tagging; Anja Riedel took care of the linker variation. Joshua Sachs and Philipp Walch generated the ccdB-construct. Without the devotion of all of the people mentioned above, the project would not have been feasible. Philipp Walch performed the biobricking of the submitted parts.
We want to thank Dominik Niopek and Hannah Meyer for their expertise when writing the RFC100.
Tag Optimization
Ralf Beer, Konrad Herbst and Nikolaos Ignatiadis designed strategies for the optimization of the indigoidine-Tag, which includes the creation of 58 engineered indigoidine synthetases and the development of a quantitative time-resolved indigoidine assay. These hard-working fellows did not mind spending 48 hours in a row at the bench, generating and testing large plasmid libraries and performing hundreds of co-transformations, thereby establishing the RFC99. Meanwhile, Konrad proved that one can write a script for almost any purpose. He contributed most to the analysis of the indigoidine assay, the progress of the tag optimization strategy and the RFC99. Nikos was involved in the design of the first constructs and was a big help in the creation of the synthetic T-domains. Ralf focussed on plasmid and primer design as well as the labwork and was actually considered to be integrated into the NRPSDesigner as an alternative sequence-based domain prediction tool. But not only these three guys were infected by the blue fever - thanks to Hannah Meyer they always had an advisor at their side to engage in more and sometimes less scientific discussions.
Gold Recycling
The cloning strategies and amplification of the Del cluster were performed and developed by Florian Schmidt, Sophie Rabe, Nils Kurzawa and Johanna Meichsner. The experiments started with the amplification of DelH executed by Johanna Meichsner, which turned out to be one of the most challenging parts of our project. Johanna proved to be extremely resilient to recurrent setbacks and her power of endurance gave a great example to the whole team. Florian Schmidt, Sophie Rabe and Nils Kurzawa took care of the plasmid assembly of the remaining genes from the Del cluster. After DelRest was successfully amplified, Florian Schmidt and Sophie Rabe worked as well on the assembly of the DelH plasmid and the gold precipitation by delftibactin. Sophie Rabe was furthermore responsible of proteins assays, delftibactin purification and MICRO-TOF, Florian Schmidt established the protocol to dissolve electronic waste. All of them were extremely dedicated and cloned day and night.
Ilia Kats cloned the pIK8 plasmid and all prior plasmids necessary for the establishment of the methylmalonyl-CoA pathway. He performed all steps of the cloning procedure of these plasmids from primer design up to electroporation and screening.
Here we want to give a special thank you to our advisors Dominik Niopek, Katharina Genreith and Fanny Georgi for their great help in planning of the cloning strategies and introducing us to the world of primer design! Thanks to Fanny for helping with electroporations any time of the day (or night).
NRPSDesigner
The software-core-team consisted of Konrad Herbst, Ilia Kats, Nikolaos Ignatiadis, Julia Schessner and Nils Kurzawa. They worked together on the implementation of the NRPSDesigner software and the establishment of the respective database. Additionally, Joshua Sachs, Anja Riedel, Julia Schessner and Philipp Walch contributed to the maintenance of the database. Furthermore, administrator Ilia Kats was in charge of our internal wiki and server. All of the software geeks mentioned above worked on our sub-software project iGEM42. The advisors Hannah Meyer and Tim Heinemann helped not only with the NRPSDesigner, but also with motivating the entire team. A big thanks to Hannah for bringing all these yummy cookies and to Tim for helping to eat them!
Modeling
Modeling of the recombinant delftibactin production and the feasibility of the industrial scale gold recycling from electronic waste using delftibactin was mainly performed by Nikolaos Ignatiadis. On his journey through metabolic modeling of delftibactin producing E. coli, bioreactor simulations and cost estimations, he was supported by Johanna Meichsner and Joshua Sachs, who did research on financial data and Florian Schmidt on chemical equations. They received helpful advice by Tim Heinemann.
The modeling of the production kinetics of indigoidine to disentangle the underlying mechanisms of bacterial growth and peptide synthesis was realized by the task force consisting of Konrad Herbst, Ilia Kats, supported by Lorenz Adlung. Konrad was responsible of processing of the time-resolved experimental data, which were generated by him and Ralf Beer. Ilia then generated a model to elucidate the influence of indigoidine production on bacterial growth of bacteria and to provide a more quantitative understanding of the synthesis efficiency of the different T domains and PPTases.
Wiki Design
Our wiki is mainly build on stylesheets from Bootstrap 3.0 and was implemented by Nils Kurzawa. He wrote the main javascripts and css stylesheets used on this wiki. Nils and Tim Heinemann came up with the idea of the main page and subsequently designed the templates for all other pages. Tania Christiansen was responsible several pictures such as the symbols used in the wiki navigation. All team members developed quite some talent when generating graphics and figures in Inkskape (yes Ilia, it is a great piece of software). Thanks also to our creative advisors Fanny Georgi (who should think of an alternative career as photographer) and Katharina Genreit who came up with many ideas. After the basic implementation was finished, Nils received help in the wiki design from Nikolaos Ignatiadis, Ilia Kats, Konrad Herbst and Johanna Meichsner. Important to mention is Tim Heinemann for his niggling but always helpful comments.
Videos
We produced two videos to spread our project to a wider audience.
Introduction to NRPS Whiteboard Animation
This short clip explains the basics on NRPS and gives a very short outline of our project.
Tania Christiansen is responsible for the script, illustration and audio/video production. Ralf Beer helped with the audio recording and processing.
RFC 99 & 100: Peptide Production Pipeline Video
This video demonstrates the implementation of our two RFCs: We show short sequences of the process and explain the single steps to encourage the community to use this new peptide production approach.
Hanna Meichsner is responsible for the script and audio/video production. Ralph Beer, Tania Christiansen, Nikolaos Ignatidis, Sophie Rabe and Philipp Walch were recorded for several different scenes.
Human Practice
The entire team worked on our human practice projects. Philipp Walch is a member of the education initiative ""Life-Science Lab"" and organized the essay competition for the high school students. Philipp Walch, Sophie Rabe and Tania Christiansen presented our project at various events to the interested public together with members of the high school iGEM Team from 2012. Joshua Sachs who volunteers as a fire fighter established the contact with the army, which gave us insight in the bio-weapons defense program (ABC). Ralf Beer and Konrad Herbst received valuable input from Peptide Specialties Laboratories GmbH. Philipp Walch and Nikos Ignatiadis visited TBM Edelmetall Recycling. Johanna Meichsner introduced us to Dorothea van Aaken, who organizes environmental workshops for primary students. Fanny Georgi organized the contact to Dr. Zawatzky from German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ). Dominik Niopek introduced us to the science author Olaf Fritsche and Lorenz Adlung, who also writes, got us in contact with Isabel Marleen Pötzsch. Both Dominik Niopek and Lorenz Adlung also helped with the ""not invented by nature"" collaboration.

About Zhejiang University
“
Seeking the Truth and Pioneering New Trails
”
-- The Motto of Zhejiang University
Located in the historical and picturesque city of Hangzhou, Zhejiang University (ZJU) is a prestigious institution of higher education in China with a long history. Qiushi Academy, the predecessor of Zhejiang University, was founded in 1897 and was one of the earliest modern academies of higher learning established in China. During World War II, Zhejiang University suffered from disasters but insisted on the school's spirits “Seeking the Truth”, and been praised as one of the Four most Prominent Universities in the Republic China. In its 115-year history, Zhejiang University has always been committed to cultivating talent with excellence, advancing science and technology, serving for social development, and promoting culture, with the spirit best manifested in the university motto “Seeking the Truth and Pioneering New Trails”.
Today, Zhejiang University is one of the top universities in China with distinctive features and a national as well as international impact. Research at ZJU spans 12 academic disciplines, covering philosophy, economics, law, education, literature, history, art, science, engineering, agriculture, medicine, management and etc. The elective system of ZJU is very flexible，so students can enroll whatever the courses they are interested in. That is why we could build such a team with various majors but have no difficulty in understanding each other.
Zhejiang University Anthem
The vast sea contains all streams, all rivers;
Great learning connects Heaven and Earth.
Metaphysical is Tao; instrumental is Tool.
Rites tell people apart; Music gets them together.
To know their relations would make us ever brighter.
There’s a national university standing by River Qiantang,
Whose eternal philosophy is seeking truth from facts.
Progressive education can produce those able to govern;
Never say you know the essence, let alone the truth.
Reform is necessary, and renewal is a must;
To be a vanguard is to be both creative and innovative;
Dear young vanguards should be clear of the principles.
Be devoted to study, deep in thinking and good in understanding;
We offer arts, science, agriculture, technology, and beyond;
It needs you to know them all -- their origins and applications.
To become successful people will be like true gold to be made;
To give up fractional views we’re of far sight and broad mind;
To rejuvenate our great nation is to harmonize the whole world.

Wet lab
Before Regional jamboree
The project is mainly separated into two parts: the bacterial ghost sensor project and the dual-bacterial atrazine killer project. We also paid special attention to the biosafety issues with biomineral shell, holin-anitiholin system and ccdB circuit. Besides, standardized riboswitches have been characterized to invest their performance. Human practice is also an important part in our project and we devoted ourselves to the promotion of synthetic biology.
Angli Xue, the team leader, was in charge of all teamwork and assured everything was in order.
Jiasheng Wang was in charge of the whole experiment, mainly the bacterial ghost sensor project.
Zukai Liu was in charge of the atrazine elf project.
Yujie Chen was in charge of financial affairs and the characterization part.

Collaboration - Help Other Teams
We have helped UC Davis iGEM team this year. Part of UC Davis’s team project aims to develop and implement an experimental data depot for biobrick characterization data. We have joined the collaboration to produce a multi-lab, extensive characterization of a commonly used part library based on their protocol and requirements.
We measured the fluorescent kinetics in an 18-hour period to characterize several members of a promoter family. The parts we choose to characterize are J23101, J23112, J23113, J23114, J23115, J23116, J23117, J23118, J23119 in iGEM 2013 Kit Distribution as well as J23108, J23109, J23111 in 2012 iGEM Kit Distribution. Then we preliminary processed all the raw data and send them to UC Davis’s iGEMers together with the information of the plate reader we used and the measurement conditions.
The results (as a downloadable table in UC Davis' project) are partly shown as

Members
The HKUST iGEM team 2013 is composed of 13 dedicated undergraduate students. Click their pictures to know more about them!
Doyle
Wendi
Cecilia
Stephy
Wilson
Astrid
Lindy DHARMAWAN
Lindy is a sophomore majoring in Biochemistry and Cell Biology. Being a silver medalist in the International Biology Olympiad you might think that would make biology among her strongest virtue. Nope. It's her ability to annoy people in the lab with her singing while doing... well, everything. Her plans after UST include earning an MD in the States and joining the cast of The Big Bang Theory.
Words of Wisdom:
When lab work gives you lemons, it's time to reflect on your competent cells.
Winnie Wai In HUI
Winnie is a Year 2 Biology student. After entering HKUST she wanted to try anything new. That was why she joined the iGEM team to explore synthetic biology and to enjoy lab work with people from various countries. Besides enriching her knowledge, she hopes to gain precious memories and friendships through iGEM.
Food for Thought
Although there may be failures in experiments, it is really exciting to see our results come out!
Doyle Jihwan LEE
Doyle is a first year Molecular Biomedical Sciences student. He ultimately plans to work in an international organization involved in public health. He was born in South Korea, but lived his life mostly abroad in Bangladesh and Thailand.
Doyle's Two Cents on Life
Doyle sometimes feel envious toward the liver cells that he cultures. He thinks they live without stress and tension unlike the neuron cells in his brain.
Cecilia Xilin SHI
Cecilia is a sophomore majoring in financial mathematics and statistics. As she majors in a subject unrelated to biology she only knew a little about synthetic biology before joining, which she did to explore the mystery of biology. She feels excited to work with a group of passionate and outstanding students and appreciates their mutual support.
Lab Mood-Booster
LB smells good!
Wilson Chun Pong HO
Wilson is a year 2 Biochemistry and Cell Biology student. His favourite things to do outside the lab include distance-running, eating and sleeping. He is not sure about what to do after graduation, maybe he will apply to be a firefighter, or pursue other things he is interested in.
Random Info
Wilson loves daydreaming. When he is doing so, he will sit there, do nothing, and think nothing. Sometimes it seems like he short-circuited.
Lynn Yuqi WANG
As a sophomore Biochemistry student, Lynn is a hard working girl with an optimistic attitude toward life. She has a good sense of humor that always makes her friends happy. Lynn plans to pursue further study in the US after graduating from HKUST, where she has her memorable university life.
Cherished Lab Memories
Lynn is in charge of using GC-MS to quantify fatty acid. However, during the sample preparation, she used droppers to absorb the organic layer together with some water into the tube. That caused the FA concentration measurement to be 0 after one day of waiting.
Satien WILIAWATY
Satien came from Jakarta, Indonesia and was born in 1994. This is her second year at HKUST. Her major is Biochemistry and Cell Biology. She loves watching movies, video editing, and singing. She joined iGEM because she wanted to learn more about synthetic biology. After HKUST, she might take further studies in the same field or a different field or maybe find a job. We never know what will happen in the future.
She loves to...
Eat lunch while waiting for digestion and running the gel.
Wendi XIAO
Wendi is a year 2 student majoring in Biology. She enjoys playing around in lab and is regarded as a potential ""hazard"" because of that. Right now she doesn't have any plans for her future, but she most probably will pursue a master's degree abroad.
Little Known Facts
Greet her! Little Wendi! Don't let her run gels alone! Nothing will appear on the gel photo... and the gel melts.
Stephy Siwei XIE
Stephy is a biochemistry student, and now is in her second year in the 3-year-program. Stephy is one of the graphic design team members, and she mostly spent her weeks finding the right companies for printing iGEM needs. Stephy is planning to go for further study in America or wherever outside Hong Kong.
What We Do that People Don't
Every Thursday, we have KOR103 course in MBMS lab, which is conducted by our leader, Chloe Eonni! Great, right? We learnt a lot! LOL ;D
Chloe Hyun Jung LEE
Chloe is a sophomore majoring in Biochemistry. She learned soooooooo much going through iGEM but it was also a really really stressful and tough process!!
Random things
She really doesn't understand why the Gibson Assembly for ACEB contruct did not work out. It should at least have the same number of colonies as the negative control, how can it have no colony at all!!! The Gibson Assembly mix certainly  affected the DNA fragments in some way... Is it possible that a gene is toxic to its native strain? Also, for BBa_J176171!! She confirmed that the linear plasmid is stable at 50°C but why can't it assemble with complementary sequences engineered in GFP? Can we really trust the sequence of this part? If this is heat sensitive, how can we confirm its sequence?
Astrid Sephira ALIM
Astrid is a sophomore at HKUST, and is studying Biochemistry and Cell Biology. Astrid works in sub-group 2 and mostly does the inoculation, which might be too many times so she got a new nickname, ""Inoculation girl""! For now, Astrid still has no clear plan at all after leaving HKUST, however she absolutely wants to go for further study or find something to do.
Cherished Lab Memories
** Astrid's sub group conversation. **
How to do the gel photo?
- Take your phone out.
- Unlock your phone.
- Choose the camera function button.
And, it is doonnneee! @#$%^&$^#&@
Raul Guillermo Medina CUELLAR
Don't let Raul's severe-looking appearance and intimidating silence deceive you: he is the nicest guy on earth! As soon as he gets to know you, he will start taking care of you as if you were a little brother/sister! His great passions are biology, chemistry and all that has to do with those fields (Don't get him started on synthetic biology!!) His bright future definitely lies within the walls of a lab!
Raul's You-Ought-to-Know:
HE IS A PRO AT TERRIBLE KNOCK-KNOCK JOKES!!! (Don't ever let him tell you one; if you are a normal person, you'll probably be scarred for life.)
Derek Ka Long CHU
Derek is a second year student studying Biochemistry. He is interested in doing research and wants to explore his options in it.

Members
The HKUST iGEM team 2013 is composed of 13 dedicated undergraduate students. Click their pictures to know more about them!
Doyle
Wendi
Cecilia
Stephy
Wilson
Astrid
Lindy, LINDY DHARMAWAN
Lindy is a sophomore majoring in Biochemistry and Cell Biology. Her being a silver medalist in the International Biology Olympiad probably made you think that biology is her strongest virtue. Nope. It's her ability to annoy people in the lab with her singing while doing...well, everything. Her plans after UST involves earning an MD in the States and joining the cast of The Big Bang Theory.
Word of Wisdom:
When lab gives you lemon, it's time to reflect on your competent cells.
Winnie, HUI WAI IN
Winnie is a Year 2 Biology student. After entering HKUST, she would like to try anything new to her. Therefore, she joins iGEM Team to explore synthetic biology and to enjoy the lab work with people from various countries. Besides enriching her knowledge, she hopes to gain precious memory and friendship in iGEM.
Food for Thoughts
Although there may be failure in the experiment, it is really exciting to see our result come out!
Doyle, JIHWAN LEE
Doyle is a first year Molecular Biomedical Science student. He ultimately plans to work in an international organization related to public health. He was born in South Korea, but lived his life mostly abroad in Bangladesh and Thailand.
Doyle's Two Cents on Life:
Doyle sometimes feel envy toward the liver cells that he cultures. He thinks they live under no stress and tension unlike his neuron cells in his brain.
Cecilia, SHI XI LIN
Cecilia is a sophomore majoring in financial mathematics and statics. As a non-biology related student, she only knows a little about synthetic biology. She joined iGEM to explore the mystery of biology. She feels excited to work with a group of passionate and outstanding students and appreciates the help from them.
Lab Mood-Booster:
LB smells good!
Wilson, HO CHUN PONG
Wilson is a year 2 Biochemistry and Cell Biology student. His favourite things to do outside the lab is distance-running, eating and sleeping. He is not sure about what to do after graduation, maybe he will apply for being a firefighter, or any other things that he is interested in.
Random Info:
Wilson loves daydreaming. When he is doing so, he will sit there, do nothing, and think nothing. Sometimes it seems he  short-circuited.
Lynn, WANG YU QI
As a sophomoric biochemstry student, Lynn is a hard working girl with an optimistic attitude towards life. She has a good sense of humor that would always make her friends happy. Lynn plans to pursuit further study in US after graduate from HKUST, where she has her memorable university life.
Cherished Lab Memories:
Lynn is in charge of using GCMS to quantify fatty acid. However, during the sample preparation, she used droppers to absorb organic layer together with some water into the tube. That makes the FA concentration measurement to be 0 after one day's  waiting.
Satien, SATIEN WILIAWATY
Satien Wiliawaty came from Jakarta, Indonesia and born in 1994. This is her second year in UST. Her major is Biochemistry and Cell Biology. She loves watching movies, editing, and singing. She join iGEM because she want to learn more about synthetic biology. After UST, she might take further studies in the same field or different field or maybe find a job. We never know what will be happen in the future.
She loves to..
Eat lunch while waiting for digestion and running the gel.
Wendi, XIAO WEN DI
Wendi is a year 2 student majoring in Biology. She enjoys play around in lab and is regarded as a potential ""hazard"" because of that. Right now she doesn't have any plan for future, most probably she'll pursue a master degree abroad.
Little Known Facts:
Greet her! Little Wendi! Don't let her do the gel-run along! Nothing will appear on the gel photo...and the gel melts.

Stephy, XIE SI WEI
Stephy is a biochemistry student, and now is in her second year in 3-year-program. Stephy is one of graphic design team members, and she mostly spent her weeks in finding the right companies for printing iGEM needs. Stephy is planning to go for further study in America or wherever outside Hong Kong.
What We Do that People Don't:
Every Thursday, we have KOR103 course in MBMS lab, which is conducted by our leader, Chloe Eonni! Great, right? We learnt a lot! LOL ;D
Chloe, HYUN JUNG LEE
Chloe is sophomore majoring in Biochemistry. She learned soooooooo much going through iGEM but it was also really really stressful and tough process!!
Random things:
She really doesn't understand why the Gibson Assmbly for ACEB contruct did not work out. It should at least have the same number of colonies as the negative control, how can it have no colony at all!!! The Gibson Assembly mix certainly have affected the DNA fragments in some way...Is it possible that a gene is toxic to its native strain? Also, for BBa_J176171!! She confirmed that the linear plasmid is stable at 50°C but why does it not assemble with complementary sequences engineered in GFP? Can we really trust sequence of this part? If this is heat sensitive, how can we confirm its sequence?
Astrid, ASTRID SEPHIRA ALIM
Astrid is a sophomore in HKUST, and studying Biochemistry and Cell Biology. Astrid works in sub-group 2 and mostly does the inoculation, which might be too many times so she got a new nickname, ""Inoculation girl""! For now, Astrid still has no clear plan at all after leaving UST, however she absolutely wants to go for further study or find something to do.
Cherished Lab Memories:
** Astrid's sub group conversation. **
How to do the gel photo?
- Take your phone out.
- Unlock your phone.
- Choose the camera function button.
And, it is doonnneee! @#$%^&$^#&@
Raul, RAUL GUILLERMO MEDINA CUELLAR
Don't let Raul's severe-looking appearance and intimidating silence deceive you: he is the nicest guy on earth! As soon as he gets to know you, he will start taking care of you as if you were a little brother/sister! His great passions are biology, chemistry and all  that has to do with those fields (Don't get him started on synthetic biology!!) His bright future definitely lies within the walls of a lab!
Raul's You-Ought-Know:
HE IS A PRO AT TERRIBLE KNOCK-KNOCK JOKES!!! (Don't ever let him tell you one; if you are a normal person, you'll probably be scarred for life)
Derek, CHU KA LONG
Derek is a first year student from Biochemistry undergraduate. He is interested in doing research and want to explore his strength on it.
Favourite Phrase:
""Ohh, did I use the wrong pipette?""

TEAM SPIRIT!
Our team consists of thirteen bright undergrads, working eagerly for nine months, transforming our project design into reality. With the kind help of our advisors and instructors, we managed to make the most of our time. We learned, grew and bonded together over the (mostly) stressful hours of digestion, gel electrophoresis, PCR and ligation. These are the people with whom we celebrated when things went right, and who propped us up when things were less than right. We wanted you to know them and us better. Don't be afraid to say HI if you see us in the Regional Jamboree. Who knows, maybe we might end up doing research together in the future!

Hi, I am a junior student majoring in Biomedical Engineering with great interest in programming.                               I chose programming on IOS system as the main attack. iBricks is my first experience in video                                games. Programming Nebula on iPhone is relatively easy to me. My maxim is where there is a                                will, there is a way.

I am regarded as a hard-working student with easy-going personality.                                  Making great videos is what I am always pursuing. Besides this, I also participated                                  in parts statistics work for our projects.
Guodong Zhu
Hi, I am a freshman from School of Information and Software Engineering, also a fantastic                               guy with passion and great imagination. Wiki is rather a great challenge for me, but I                               really enjoy this process of learning and progressing. The realization of online version                               of Nebula is also my work.

Team
Our team is made up of 7 students coming from different faculties of our University. The wetlab side of the project was developed by 4 students coming up from the life science field (Biotechnologies and Nanobiotechnologies and Biological Sciences) and the team roster was integrated by the recruitment of two students from Physics and Mathematics, who dealt with Modeling, and a student from Information Engineering working as our Wiki maker.
Martina Montinaro by Mattia Corvaglia
Physics addicted.
We see a natural event, she thinks the model that describes it.
Her words are equations and her every speech is able to get everyone to agree, leave she alone in the desert with a Swiss boxcutter, a flashlight and a magnifying glass and after a month she will have built a nuclear power plant!
When the going gets tough there is Martina Montinaro.
Gabriele Alfarano by Ludovica Scoletta
Do you have any problems with your life planning? Gabriele makes you an efficent weekly check-list.
His keyword is ""Arrangement"".
He usually lyses the bacteria with his tuneful singing.
Estrus and insanity, so, a sure future in the music or in biology!
Giampiero Lazzari by Gabriele Alfarano
Don't know which lab coat wear on your prep time?
Ask him, the fashion side of our Team!
Unwillingly, he found himself recruited in our iGEM team while waiting for his next class to begin and soon became the (over)methodical and aestethically-driven one we were looking for! You're warned: don't doodle on his lab notebook, or you'll undergo his wrath!
Mattia Corvaglia by Gabriele Alfarano
One would lose his faith even in the existence of webmasters when looking for one of them!
Well, after a long time since our project was born, we finally found Mattia, and soon understood he was the man!
He learned the whole wiki language and designed an amazing wiki in less than a daytime: somebody says he can write HTML5 pages with a single hand, while doing Sudoku with the other, blindfolded and contemporaneously jumping over a ring of fire!
Davide Magrì by Roberta Bramato
His diary is tight diary, the word ""rest"" is banished from his vocabulary!
He’s like a tireless dolphin with an open and brilliant mind, always ready to make new proposals!
“Work ” is his imperative!
His muscles and his gentlemanly ways earned him the nickname “waterman”!
Ludovica Scoletta by Martina Montinaro
Graduating master student in Applied Math.
She has joined our team moved to pity for who of us spends all the days in lab.
Eventually she has gone crazy to biologists world and now she can't help biology's models.
Between one Hilbert space and the other, on her notes you can see clearly walk E. Coli bacteria.
She has studied our model proving a lot of patience, not only with bacteria.
Emanuele Rizzo by Laura Cogli
Emanuele is a sensitive guy who puts the soul into everything he does.
Do you want to know the name of a bacterium, a virus, a parasite?
Well just ask him, named by popular demand “the Bible of Microbiology”.
His obvious Turkish descent have made him a true spoils women, Ema steals hearts…
Advisors
Two wonderful doctors worked as our wetlab instructors, helping us afford otherwise incomprehensible protocols with their constant smile.
Laura Cogli by Davide Magrì
Called THE BOSS!
All people respect her power in the lab!
She gained her extensive experience in the various fields of biology, developing a manuality out of the ordinary!
There are people who swear to have seen her working simultaneously with DNA extractions, PCR, bacterial cloning and protein quantification with excellent results in all her works.
Despite the harshness of her day, Dr. Laura Cogli always shows a dazzling smile.
Her favourite motto is: open your eyes, because to close them just a nothing.
Roberta Bramato by Giampiero Lazzari
Rigor and order, these two words can describe our supervisor at best.
Chemistry and Biology have no secrets.
In a few minutes she can solve your problem, only garlic and onions can stop her.
Like a clock, she marks every moment of laboratory life.
Instructors
Our leading guides in research, our instructors Prof. Cecilia Bucci and Prof. Dario Pisignano, helped us to give life to our long-time-awaited project.
Cecilia Bucci
Professor of Cell Biology, in whose laboratories we worked. Leader researcher in molecular basis of endocytosis, phagocytosis, host-cell interaction, cancer and neurodegenerative pathologies.
Dario Pisignano
Professor of Experimental Physics, works in the fields of Material science, Nano- and Nanobiotechnologies.

We would like to thank all of the academics, PhD students, visitors and staff members who have made this project possible. Their willingness to give us their time, their help and their valuable opinions have not only made this summer far easier, but has made the iGEM experience utterly memorable and enjoyable!
Dr. Lizzy Dridge : Dr Lizzy Dridge coordinated the Exeter iGEM team for the entire summer. She offered guidance and assistance throughout the initial conception of our project, the lab work, and all of the administrative aspects. You have been amazing. Wholeheartedly, thank you.
Dr. Paul James : Dr Paul James helped the team tremendously with the Gibson Assembly of the G-blocks to make the Green light module and the GFP output brick. He also helped with all general lab queries for the duration of our project. You have helped this project run as smoothly as it ever could have gone. Thank you for all of your time, we so appreciate it.
Dr. John Love : Dr. John Love has given us a wealth of information and assistance with the planning and undertaking of the project. His overhaul of our initial construct designs was, at first, terrifying, but has definitely paid off! His enthusiasm and obvious interest in the project has been an inspiration to the team, and has often given us the much-needed boost we needed. We really hope it was sexy enough for you.
Dr. Nic Harmer : Dr Nick Harmer was kind enough to give a lecture to aid our early thought processes. He also agreed to meet with us on various occasions to check our constructs and aid us with any queries we had.
Dr. Clive Butler : Dr Clive Butler kindly gave a lecture on synthetic biology to aid our early thought processes. He also met with us regularly to discuss our ideas and offer advice.
Clio Andreae : Clio Andreae helped us hugely in the lab, advising us with 3a assembly and many other lab techniques including; mini prepping, centrifuging, making agarose gels and transformations. We are sorry for stealing your pipettes and lighter. Thank you for everything.
Victoria Baldwin : Victoria Baldwin gave us various enzymes, samples and solutions and helped us hugely with our 3a assembly method. Victoria also offered us a great deal of help and advice with the lab work.
Dr. George Littlejohn : George littlejohn gave us a lecture at the beginning of the summer when we were still brainstorming ideas. He also gave us regular advice and guidance with queries to do with our project.
Professor Rob Beardmore : Professor Beardmore gave a great lecture on modelling and helped with the modelling throughout the project to check everything was working correctly, give advice and answer any questions.
Dr. Tom Howard : Dr Tom Howard kindly gave a lecture early on in our thought progression and brainstorming. Tom lead the 2012 iGEM team so gave insight into last years experience and offered his support whenever we had questions.
Gwen Batten : Gwen is the laboratory manager. She supervised us in the labs and showed us how to undertake various lab protocols carefully and safely. She was our first port of call whenever we had lab based queries.
Professor C Peter Winlove : Professor C Peter Winlove is a professor of Biophysics in the College of Engineering, Mathematics and Physical Sciences. He met with several team members on multiple occasions to discuss the project in great detail. He highlighted certain areas that we needed to be wary of, but was generally very positive about our project. He offered a lot of guidance to the students involved in modelling our systems.
Dr. Helen Featherstone : Dr. Helen Featherstone hosted two fantastic discussion sessions with the entire team to give structure and planning to our Outreach. She inspired us to choose option that are probably not well recognised within iGEM, and even gave us contacts to various people both within and outside of the University who could help us achieve our aims.
Dr. Nicola King : Dr. Nicola King kindly organised our talk to a group of 6th form students.
Dr. Christine Sambles : Dr. Christine Sambles gave a lecture on The 'Omics and spoke to us early on in the project to cover some aspects of Biology and Chemistry that our Physicists and Electrical Engineer may not be quite comfortable with; the 'Omics that formed the backbone of our project.
Dr. Matthew Baker : Dr. Matthew Baker met with several team members to discuss the impact our project would have on the University of Exeter and the wider community. He gave us advice on how we should best present our ideas to the public.
Dr. Janet Cotter : Dr. Janet Cotter spoke to us very early on in our planning to ensure that we considered the ethics of our project, and that we wouldn't be undertaking a project that would hold risks to the environment. She left a strong message about our responsibilities as a team which we tried to uphold throughout the summer, and encouraged us to think about aspects of our project that we had otherwise not considered.
Sponsors
Our team has received generous funding from the University of Exeter's annual fund and microbial biofuels group . In addition, we wish to thank Thermo Scientific for their kind donation of a surplus of lab consumables, without which we could not have completed our project. IDT , in addition to making our G-blocks, offered greatly appreciated advice on the sequences we asked for them to build.

Our team consists of talented students from a variety of majors, just as the field of synthetic biology encompasses a variety of specialties. Each student has an interesting background which as a whole, creates a team with strength in a wide range of areas.
Adam Nighswander
I joined the team this year because I wanted to help the with some of the challenges that we faced last year.  In both years, I joined because the field of synthetic biology is something that amazes me, with its versatility and potential.  I feel the experience, knowledge, and skills I gain from this program will give me something that I can focus my future on.
Adam Nighswander is a senior Applied Biology, Biochemistry and Molecular Biology double major from Tiffin, Ohio.  He was on the iGEM team last year and uses his experiences to help this year’s team.  He was one of the co-founders of the Biology Club, and is a member of Alpha Phi Omega.
Ayla Walters
I became involved with the Rose Hulman IGEM team because I was fascinated by their project idea. I'm very interested in the intersections between art and science, and I've enjoyed working with the rest of the team to create icons, images, and designs that will engage viewers in a creative visual and intuitive way as they learn about our project and synthetic biology as a whole.

About Us
2013 is the second year that the Eindhoven University of Technology is participating in the iGEM competition. Our teams consists of seven diverse students with a variety of backgrounds. We have had a lot of aid from different people across the University, in particular from Tom de Greef, Maarten Merkx, Natal van Riel and Stijn Aper. Below you will find an overview of the team and a personal message from each member.
TeamPic The TU-Eindhoven 2013 iGEM Team!
ArdjanLabCaptainLab Lad
Currently I am partaking in the second year of my bachelor Biomedical Technology here at the TU/e. Whilst I thoroughly enjoy my courses I am always looking to do more and to put my theory into practice.  The iGEM competition gave me the perfect opportunity to do this, allowing me to spend time working on research of my own choosing, and giving me the chance to spend time in the lab. Outside the university I spend my time keeping up with my favorite TV shows or, weather permitting, on the road bike.
If you don't like penguins I don't like you.
Ardjan
PascalModelingCaptainWiki Wizard
I am a bachelor student in Biomedical Engineering at the TU/e. Classes in biochemistry and the molecular biology of the cell raised my interest in synthetic biology. Since the field is relatively new there is a vast range of possibilities for research in synthetic biology. By competing in the iGEM competition I hope to open doors to new opportunities using my Biomedical background. Furthermore it will be a big - though very interesting - challenge to set up a whole research. However, I am confident that with this great team of students we will be capable of doing great research!
I don't like penguins.
Pascal
ZandraModelingModeling MagicianWiki Minion
I am a Biomedical Engineering master student at the TU/e. I am originally from Mexico, but after finishing my bachelor on Biomedical Engineering there I decided to come to The Netherlands to continue with my studies and seek greater challenges. I love being involved in many things at the same time, the more the merrier, especially if they put my brains to the test! iGEM has definitely given me that extra something that I always enjoy, making me get involved not only in modeling and programming, which I really like, but also in the lab. When I am not busy with the iGEM or my master studies I like reading a good book and running, dancing or just keeping myself active.
Killing 'm All!

NickLabCorrespondent of External AffairsHuman Practices
As a Biomedical Engineering student, I'm always interested in some complicated and interesting things. For me, the major reason to take part at the iGEM team of this year was doing research in a quite young field of science and engineering. Now I can bring the basic knowledge of theoretical courses into practice, which I think is nice and very usefull for a better understanding of the theory. I think iGEM is a nice opportunity to widen my horizon, improve my academical skills and to learn a lot about this interesting and emerging field of science.
I don't have a quote yet...

YicongModelingStochastics Sensei
I'm currently enrolled in master program Biomedical Engineering at TU/e. My bachelor was mechanical engineering. But I thought Biomedical engineering is a newly-emerged challenging area so I switched to it. It turns out to be a rewarding decision as I learned a lot from the lectures and I found many similarities in both engineering subjects. Now I would like to try some projects to get deeper understanding of engineering principles so I parcitipated in the iGEM team.

JacquesLabThe ProtegéJoker
Finishing the third year of my bachelor in Biomedical Engineering at the TU/e I thought iGEM 2013 was the perfect project to do as my final project. Having been fascinated by the intracellular world since my first ever biology class, a synthetic biology competition seems like a logical sequel. By participating in the competition I hope to further improve my collaboration and lab skills. Next to that it's just really fun to have your own little research group running.
Look out! ... Eag1!!!

SanderLabSDS Sander
Since my enrollment as a Biomedical Engineering bachelor student at the TU/e, I have thoroughly enjoyed the wide range of subjects involved in this study. Being an extraordinary and internationally reknown challenge, participation in iGEM allows me to dive into the interesting discipline of Synthetic Biology, which I consider to continue for my Master's. Furthermore, our iGEM project offers valuable opportunities to improve my lab skills, while also enabling me to learn about the entire pathway from fundamental research to functional clinical applications.
Too basic or not too basic, that is the question.

dr. Maarten MerkxLabAssociate ProfessorBiomedical Chemistry & Chemical Biology
Maarten Merkx (1970) studied chemistry (cum laude) at the Radboud University Nijmegen specializing in organic chemistry (Prof. Nolte) and biophysical chemistry (Prof. de Grip). He did his PhD with Prof. Bruce A. Averill (University of Amsterdam, 1995-1999) studying metalloenzyme catalysis and was a Human Frontier of Science Program (HFSP) post-doctoral fellow with Prof. Stephen J. Lippard (MIT, Cambridge, USA) studying methane monooxgenases. In his scientific work he combines a fundamental interest in the molecular origin of biomolecular recognition with a strong desire to apply and test this knowledge through the engineering of protein-based tools that allow the imaging of molecular processes in live cells or organisms. An important research theme is to develop generic engineering concepts for the construction of protein switches and apply these as sensors and regulators for intracellular imaging, synthetic biology and molecular diagnostics. In 2006 he was awarded both a young investigator grant from the HFSP and a VIDI award by the Netherlands Organization of Scientific Research (NWO).
dr.ir. Tom F.A. de GreefModelingAssistant ProfessorComputional Biology
Dr. Ir. Tom de Greef was born in Eindhoven, the Netherlands, in 1980. He studied at the University of Eindhoven (TU/e, the Netherlands), where he received his M.Sc. degree in Biomedical Engineering cum laude in 2004. He completed his Ph.D. at the Department of Chemistry at the same university in 2008 with professors E. W. Meijer and R. P. Sijbesma. The subject of his Ph.D. work concerned the synthesis of novel materials based on quadruple hydrogen bonding motifs. Subsequently, he moved to the Biomodeling and Bioinformatics group of prof. P. A. J. Hilbers at the Department of Biomedical Engineering (TU/e) and focused on the kinetic modeling of a large variety of self-assembling systems using deterministic as well as stochastic modeling approaches. In 2010, Tom de Greef started as assistant professor (tenure track) in Physical Chemistry at the Department of Biomedical Engineering and the Institute for Complex Molecular Systems at the TU/e. His work has been directed towards understanding the physical basis for the self-assembly of artificial and biological molecules using a combined experimental and theoretical approach.
dr.ir. Natal A.W. van RielModelingAssistant ProfessorComputional Biology
Dr. Natal van Riel (1973) received his MSc degree from the Department of Electrical Engineering at Eindhoven University of Technology in 1995. In 2000 he obtained a PhD degree in Molecular Cell Biology from Utrecht University (Prof. Verrips; Netherlands) for research on integrating computational modeling and experimental work to study complex biochemical networks. The research was carried out in the Biotechnology group of Unilever Research Vlaardingen. From 2000 to 2003 he worked in the Department of Electrical Engineering of Eindhoven University of Technology investigating the application of system and control theory to understand biological processes. In 2003 he was appointed as assistant professor in the Department of Biomedical Engineering at the same university and initiated Systems Biology research in Eindhoven. This research was expanded when he joined the BioModeling and bioInformatics group (Prof. Hilbers) in 2006 to lead the Computational Systems Biology research program, investigating complex, multi-factorial human diseases.
Stijn Aper MSc.LabLab Guidance
Stijn Aper studied Biomedical Engineering at the Eindhoven University of Technology and obtained his MSc in 2012. Currently, he is doing his PhD research at the Eindhoven University of Technology with dr. Merkx. The topic of his master research project was the development of a genetically-encoded, modular antibody sensor for application in low cost point-of-care diagnostic assays. In his PhD project his focus shifted towards unraveling the molecular mechanisms behind complex cellular behavior. At the moment he applies a synthetic biology type of approach to develop modular protein switches to interfere with intracellular Zn2+ homeostasis and signaling.

The work for this project was fully performed by the iGEM TU-Eindhoven 2013 team members, the lab work started from June 2013 onwards.
The idea of the CEST protein producing bacteria was developed by the team way before starting the actual lab work, it was the result of thorough literature research and discussions. All the experiments, the modeling and the device design were planned and executed by the team. Our advisers gave us guidance when we required it, but their function was merely as counselors. We receive lab guidance from Stijn Aper, who is a PhD student at TU Eindhoven. He supervised our lab work, especially in the beginning of the project, and gave us valuable advices whenever we encountered an issue with the outcome of the experiments.
The human practices project was completely developed by the team with the collaboration of 6 iGEM teams from across the world. The teams were asked to revise and classify a common statement about Synthetic Biology as true, false, or inconclusive. These teams were also asked to write a brief discussion piece about the statement and the arguments behind the final classification given to the statement.
The team managed all the organizational matters, including sponsoring. We made our own logos, designs and drawings, except for those found on the safety section of our wiki which were made by the industrial designer Mariana Félix. The wiki, presentation and poster style were also designed and developed by the team, but Mariana Félix helped us with the aesthetic details of the poster and presentation.
The Escherichia coli K12 strain, MG1655 which we required for the chassis of our device was provided by Groningen University.

Boris Dyakov
Boris is a 3rd year student studying cell and molecular biology. He was our lab manager this summer and was too busy doing work to really put much thought into this section. His hobbies include cooking and repairing bikes.
Fun fact: he has his pilots license!
Adam Komorowski
Adam is currently completing his third year; he is a double major in Immunology, as well as Molecular Genetics and Microbiology. This is Adam's second year with the UofT iGEM team, in which he filled the role of President.
Michael Yu
In biological sciences I am interested in ab initio protein structure prediction, because it is a hard problem that hasn’t been fully solved and I like hard problems. At home I like to cook and not do the dishes afterwards, because the first is tasty and the second is boring so I procrastinate. When I get bored I either read a book, or go on my computer to build ahistorical countries in the historical game Europa Universalis 4, or just go buy beer.
Monica Akula
I am a neuroscience major with a 4.3 GPA. My interests include mathematics and genetics. In my barely existent spare time I do slave labour for others.
Alejandro Duque
Third year undergraduate majoring in both Biotechnology and Molecular Genetics & Microbiology. First year involved in the iGEM Toronto team. Focused on the risk assessment and biosafety of our biofilm project.
Cathy Su
I am a biophysics specialist who is especially interested in working on epigenetics. I'd like to cure myopia within the next quarter century.
Seemi
Seemi is completing her second year as a Global Health and Molecular Genetics and Microbiology major, as well as a Psychology minor.
Abdiwahab Moalim
I am a third year undergraduate student in Cell Biology and Physiology. In science, my interests lie in many fields but especially in the spaces between them. In fact I have just reached a breakthrough in my super top secret research bridging all fields that will change the world and I can't wait to tell you! But hey, look over there - fourth sentence!

Boris Steipe
Boris Steipe has been the principal UofT iGEM Faculty Advisor since 2011. He is an Associate Professor at the University of Toronto, and is cross-appointed to the Departments of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics and Microbiology. He serves as the director of the Specialist programme in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology. Boris completed both his MD and PhD at the Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität in München (Munich), Germany. Boris' post-doctoral work was completed under Nobel laureate Robert Huber at the Max-Planck-Institut für Biochemie in Martinsreid, Germany.
Kristina Han
Kristina Han is the principal graduate student advisor for the UofT iGEM team. Kristina is completing her PhD at the University of Toronto in the lab of Prof. James Rini at the Department of Biochemistry. The award for Outstanding TA was given to Kristina by the Department of Biochemistry in 2012.

Twelve Awesome Biomakers
The right team makes all the difference. Fortunately, the Purdue iGEM team has everything you could hope for.
Amanda Shanley
Amanda Shanley, preferably known as Amanda Pearl or just Pearl, is finishing up her fifth and last here at Purdue. She will be graduating in May 2014 with bachelors in both biological engineering and biochemistry. This is her second year on the team. Some of the things that make her happy are picking wild flowers, reading a good science fiction book, and spending quality time with family and friends. Because her family owns an orchard in small town Denver, Indiana, Amanda can name over 20 different varieties of apples off the top of her head from Almata to Shenango to Zestar.
Chris Thompson
Chris actually has huge writer’s block due to Charlotte’s bio being so much cooler than he could think of. He has been doing iGEM since high school and was on the team that won the first ever high school iGEM jamboree. Currently Chris is a sophomore and a biological engineering major at Purdue University. People seem to like Chris because he’s polite and rarely late. He likes to eat ice cream and really enjoys a nice pair of slacks. He also enjoys books, long bike adventures, and animals. Chris dislikes close-minded people, the letter w, and the state of Texas. Chris enjoys volunteering as a Big Brother and at his local Humane Society. Chris spends most of his time in iGEM sending obnoxious emails to other teams. Chris hopes to one day fulfill his childhood dream of ruling planet Earth. But if that doesn’t work out, he’d also settle with starting a company in Colorado!
James Nolan
James, or Jim, has just begun his third year of biological engineering at Purdue. He's the secretary of the Purdue iGEM team. Despite his best efforts to remain exclusively in the mathematical and computational side of the team, he fell into becoming Purdue iGEM's primary cloner. Jim's technical interests include synthetic multicellularity, biosensors and DIYbio. With his fellow iGEMer, Peter Mercado, he is starting a web- and eventually community-lab-based hub for DIYbio and STEM education in Indianapolis. Jim has a pet giraffe named Sally who lives in the Happy Hollow Park near Purdue's West Lafayette campus.
Peter Mercado
Peter is a junior in biochemistry and entrepreneurship. He thoroughly enjoys a good drama series like House of Cards, Ray Donovan and The Mentalist. Peter likes to go to the gym, stroll campus on late nights and chill on weekends. He has had a variety of internships at Institutes, Corporations, and universities but overall thinks hell end up starting multiple business with his friends. Peter learned this about himself after working with iGEM as treasurer! His life goal is to retire his mom then move to Dominican Republic and live off the land. If you really want to bond with Peter find an isolated spot and an stimulating topic and he'll be yours for life.
Nidhi Menon
Nidhi (also called Needy by her International friends, just because) is now a junior, majoring in biological engineering and minoring in biotechnology. She’s originally from one of the most fun to be places in the world- Mumbai, India. She plays Badminton with the Purdue Badminton Club and occasionally enjoys swimming, volleyball, soccer and basketball. Don’t be deceived by her tender looks, she has a blue belt in Karate and does not hesitate in showing off her skills. (This is a subtle warning for Chris) She enjoys adventure sports and has been river rafting, skydiving, paragliding and mountain biking! She also plans to go scuba diving in the following year! Apart from having a keen interest in forensic science and genetic engineering, she also enjoys history, exploring new places and learning new languages. She is fluent in English, Hindi, Marathi, Malayalam and French, and is now in the process of learning Arabic. She loves animals and has had a little red crested bulbul, a european shorthair and a labrador as pets. You probably already know that she talks a lot about herself but there’s one more little thing you have got to know and it is by far the most important one. Everything else aside, she still does not know the purpose of life which means you should never take her too seriously!
Xiuyuan Yang
Xiuyuan Yang is also known as Tim because his first name is hard to pronounce. Xiuyuan is now a senior majoring in biological engineering. Xiuyuan is from Nanjing, China, where the city shares a similar climate with West Lafayette. Xiuyuan likes reading books in a quiet environment, he does not care too much about the content, read for read.... Besides, Xiuyuan practices martial arts, a very controversial hobby, but he did not involve in any violence events! He has numerophobia actually.
Charlotte Hoo
Charlotte is a sophomore in biomedical engineering from the Windy City (Chicago), which is fitting because she loves to sail!  Despite her passion, she is very afraid of deep water, an interesting mix…  Charlotte has an identical twin, so if something ever goes wrong, it was her twin’s fault!  If Charlotte is not running or biking, you can probably find her eating, thinking about what to eat, or sleeping.  Did you know that Charlotte can breakdance?  Probably not, because she can’t.  But learning to breakdance is on her lifelong agenda!
Alec Gorge
Alec is a sophomore in computer science. He is originally from Minneapolis, MN but has also lived in Alpharetta, GA, Carmel, IN, Hong Kong and Sydney, Australia. He loves building awesome iPhone apps and websites, and is an avid music lover and reader. He is particularly fond of listening to Phish and Grateful Dead, playing the piano and reading books of all varieties. You might run into him playing basketball at the rec.
Austin Hogan
Clarence-Austin J. Hogan, or as our team knows him, Austin, is a junior from Tuskegee University who is studying biology. He joined the Purdue iGEM team through the HHMI program where he looked at the statistical analysis of the data we collected. He enjoys fishing, the occasional paintball game, and camping in the great outdoors. One crazy fun fact about Austin is that he enjoys driving his truck through the mud with friends while drinking sweet tea at the same time. His idea of a perfect Friday would be to mud ride after taking a test, eat a light dinner, then go fishing, cook the fish, and camp out over night.
Betsy Benner
Betsy is a junior in biological engineering. This is her first year on the iGEM team and she is working on the Human Practices aspect of the project. In her free time, she enjoys spending time with friends and family, running, and watching movies.
Ryan Wagner
Ryan is a junior in biological engineering.  He has been on the iGEM team since sophomore year, where he worked on the Human Practices aspect of the project.  Originally from sunny Fort Lauderdale, he enjoys fishing, wakeboarding, going to the beach (which sadly isn't much of an option in Indiana), and working out.  He also really enjoys cooking and grilling.  His specialty? Steak and guacamole.
Swetha Vinjimoor
Swetha Vinjimoor is a junior majoring in biological engineering and is also pursuing the pre-dental track. This is her first year on the iGEM team and is working on the human practices aspects of the project. Some of her favorite hobbies include singing, reading and hanging out with her friends. She particularly enjoys singing Indian classical music and has given vocal performances at various events and places (such as California, Ohio, India, etc). Oh, and she also loves roller coasters!! Six flags and Cedar Point are two of her favorite amusement parks. One crazy fact about her is that she has never had meat in her life (ever!), and is actually pretty proud of it.

iGEM
Official Profile
Welcome!  This is the official wiki of the Purdue Biomakers, Purdue’s official iGEM team since 2006.  The International Genetically Engineered Machine competition (iGEM) is the premiere undergraduate Synthetic Biology competition. iGEM began in January of 2003 with a month-long course at MIT during their Independent Activities Period (IAP). The students designed biological systems to make cells blink. This design course grew to a summer competition, which has then evolved over the past ten years to include over 250 teams from all over the world. Student teams are given a kit of biological parts at the beginning of the summer from the Registry of Standard Biological Parts. Working at their own schools over the summer, they use these parts and new parts of their own design to build biological systems and operate them in living cells. This project design and competition format is an exceptionally motivating and effective teaching method. In 2011 iGEM expanded to include a High School Division and an Entrepreneurship Division in 2012.
2006 was the first year that Purdue participated, entering the competition with seven undergraduate members and three advisers. Purdue continued to compete for the next four years, earning bronze medals almost every year but never anything more. Due to lack of interest, financial support, and time, Purdue did not field a team in the 2011 iGEM competition. Fortunately, the team was revived with enough interest and support to not only field a team in 2012, but receive a gold medal and advance to the international competition at MIT for the first time in the team’s history.
Now the Purdue Biomakers are back again, better than ever. With more members, funding, and a focus on reaching out to the Purdue community, you can expect the 2013 iGEM team to do better than ever in the iGEM competition!

The Base of Operations
Purdue University is a public, comprehensive institution. Founded in 1869 by a land-grant from Lafayette businessman John Purdue. It does not feel big to its students, even though it is one of America's largest universities. Indeed, the main campus in West Lafayette, Indiana, was built around a master plan that keeps walking time between classes to a maximum of 12 minutes. Its 1,579-acre campus is located in West Lafayette, 65 miles northwest of Indianapolis.
The West Lafayette campus offers more than 200 majors for undergraduates, over 70 master’s and doctoral programs, and professional degrees in pharmacy and veterinary medicine. In addition, Purdue has 18 intercollegiate sports teams and more than 850 student organizations. Today, Purdue is a member of the Big Ten Conference, and is a well known world-class research institution. Purdue enrolls the second largest student body of any university in Indiana as well as the fourth largest international student population of any university in the United States.  More information about Purdue University can be found at www.purdue.edu.

These are our team's favorite parts
BBa_K1166001
The Fumarate-Nitrate Reductase protein or FNR helps hypoxic promoters to have a more sensitive hypoxic response, it works as an activator and repressor for oxygen-dependant genes. Activity is proven by comparing the expression of GFP (BBa_E0040) by promoters with and without the simultaneous expression of the FNR protein (BAL38390.1).
BBa_K1166002
We assembled this device to save time and ligation reactions for future teams wanting to use the E.coli secretion system. This secretion device includes all the necessary elements (linker-HlyA secretion signal peptide and the expression cassette for HlyB and HlyD) for the secretion of expression cassettes cloned in the 5' terminal of the device.
This secretion device is usable by Silver standard fusion in its 5' end for proteins with no stop codon. Codes for both the proteins HlyB and HlyD (native from uropathogenic strains of E. coli), which, along with the constitutively expressed TolC protein, form a secretion channel. This secretion system recognizes proteins tagged with the C-terminal secretion signal peptide HlyA, and secretes them to the exterior of the bacteria.
Source Parts:
AraC/pBAD: Bba_I0500
HlyA: Bba_K554002
HlyB; Bba_K554007
HlyD: Bba_K554008
Parts we helped to characterize.
pArs_mRFP (BBa_K1106003)
A promoter sensitive to the presence of the arsenite ion. It codes for mRFP to produce a red fluorescence when in presence of arsenite, working as a biosensor. This part is from Team: Buenos_Aires and was characterized in our lab as a collaboration between TecMonterrey and Buenos_Aires.
New parts we created
Hip-1 (BBa_K1166000)
Composed of the HIP-1 promoter with the FNR expression cassette upstream for a stronger hypoxic regulation, this promoter will start translation in coding sequences 3' downstream in a hypoxic environment.
His-TAT (BBa_K1166003)
A biobrick that includes the TAT signal peptide that can be fused to any protein for an easy internalization into mammal cells. It includes a 6x His-tag for easy purification.
TAT is a cell penetrating peptide (CPP) derived from the transactivator of transcription from HIV and has been used to internalize a range of large and small molecules from peptides, DNA and antibodies, to liposomes.
TRAIL (BBa_K1166004)
Contains the T7 expression cassette for the soluble part (aminoacids 98-281) of TRAIL with an N-terminal histidine tag (x6) to enhance its purification. It is known to cause apoptosis by binding a membrane receptor.
TAT-Apoptin (BBa_K1166005)
Codes for the T7 expression cassette for TAT-Apoptin composed of a N-terminal TAT translocation peptide, followed by a linker (GGGGS), a histidine tag (6x) and by the same linker fused to Apoptin. Apoptin is a protein from the Chicken Anemia Virus known to cause apoptosis in human cancer cell lines only using a pathway independent from P53 by a phosphorilation in the Threonine 108.

Tec de Monterrey
We are the Tec de Monterrey iGEM team from Mexico and we are representing Tecnológico de Monterrey university. Our university institution was founded in 1943 by Eugenio Garza Sada and a group of businessmen formed a Civil Partnership, nonprofit, called Higher Education and Research, A.C.
The Tecnológico de Monterrey is a multicampus system with common parameters among which are: the culture of responsibility and attachment to work, integrity and honesty, and innovation and entrepreneurship.  Based on the results of an extensive consultation, our institution defined its new mission in the following terms: ""To be persons of integrity, ethical standards and a humanistic vision internationally competitive in their field who are citizens while engaged in the development economic, political, social and cultural life of their community and to the sustainable use of natural resources "".
During the past years, the institution has turned its attention to biotechnology heavily investing in infrastructure, teaching and laboratory equipment creating the Biotechnology Center.
Biotechnology Center
The FEMSA Biotechnology Center in the Tecnológico de Monterrey integrates researchers from several academic departments to create interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary groups. Also, it's dedicated to generate research, knowledge transfer and business design models in food and biotechnology areas. The Biotechnology Center emerged 15 years ago as a response to the growing trend in scientific and technological innovation in the country and the whole world.
To development our research and project, we have been supported by the EBA (the Biotechnology and Food Division), giving us the necessary space to work. At this center, we had access to the Laboratory of Genetic Manipulation and Molecular Diagnostics, which became our workplace in where we performed most of experiments. We also collaborate and form part of a chair for students called i4 belonging to the EBA, the Biotechnology and Food Division.
i4 CHAIR
We belong to one of the EBA research programs, the i4 Chair for students that is a series of curricular and co-curricular activities that provide the opportunity of augmenting the capabilities of:
Imagine.
Investigate.
Innovate.
Incubate.

Members
The HKUST iGEM team 2013 is composed of 13 dedicated undergraduate students. Click their pictures to know more about them!
Doyle
Wendi
Cecilia
Stephy
Wilson
Astrid
Lindy DHARMAWAN
Lindy is a sophomore majoring in Biochemistry and Cell Biology. Being a silver medalist in the International Biology Olympiad you might think that would make biology among her strongest virtue. Nope. It's her ability to annoy people in the lab with her singing while doing... well, everything. Her plans after UST include earning an MD in the States and joining the cast of The Big Bang Theory.
Words of Wisdom:
When lab work gives you lemons, it's time to reflect on your competent cells.
Winnie Wai In HUI
Winnie is a Year 2 Biology student. After entering HKUST she wanted to try anything new. That was why she joined the iGEM team to explore synthetic biology and to enjoy lab work with people from various countries. Besides enriching her knowledge, she hopes to gain precious memories and friendships through iGEM.
Food for Thought
Although there may be failures in experiments, it is really exciting to see our results come out!
Doyle Jihwan LEE
Doyle is a first year Molecular Biomedical Sciences student. He ultimately plans to work in an international organization involved in public health. He was born in South Korea, but lived his life mostly abroad in Bangladesh and Thailand.
Doyle's Two Cents on Life
Doyle sometimes feel envious toward the liver cells that he cultures. He thinks they live without stress and tension unlike the neuron cells in his brain.
Cecilia Xilin SHI
Cecilia is a sophomore majoring in financial mathematics and statistics. As she majors in a subject unrelated to biology she only knew a little about synthetic biology before joining, which she did to explore the mystery of biology. She feels excited to work with a group of passionate and outstanding students and appreciates their mutual support.
Lab Mood-Booster
LB smells good!
Wilson Chun Pong HO
Wilson is a year 2 Biochemistry and Cell Biology student. His favourite things to do outside the lab include distance-running, eating and sleeping. He is not sure about what to do after graduation, maybe he will apply to be a firefighter, or pursue other things he is interested in.
Random Info
Wilson loves daydreaming. When he is doing so, he will sit there, do nothing, and think nothing. Sometimes it seems like he short-circuited.
Lynn Yuqi WANG
As a sophomore Biochemistry student, Lynn is a hard working girl with an optimistic attitude toward life. She has a good sense of humor that always makes her friends happy. Lynn plans to pursue further study in the US after graduating from HKUST, where she has her memorable university life.
Cherished Lab Memories
Lynn is in charge of using GC-MS to quantify fatty acid. However, during the sample preparation, she used droppers to absorb the organic layer together with some water into the tube. That caused the FA concentration measurement to be 0 after one day of waiting.
Satien WILIAWATY
Satien came from Jakarta, Indonesia and was born in 1994. This is her second year at HKUST. Her major is Biochemistry and Cell Biology. She loves watching movies, video editing, and singing. She joined iGEM because she wanted to learn more about synthetic biology. After HKUST, she might take further studies in the same field or a different field or maybe find a job. We never know what will happen in the future.
She loves to...
Eat lunch while waiting for digestion and running the gel.
Wendi XIAO
Wendi is a year 2 student majoring in Biology. She enjoys playing around in lab and is regarded as a potential ""hazard"" because of that. Right now she doesn't have any plans for her future, but she most probably will pursue a master's degree abroad.
Little Known Facts
Greet her! Little Wendi! Don't let her run gels alone! Nothing will appear on the gel photo... and the gel melts.
Stephy Siwei XIE
Stephy is a biochemistry student, and now is in her second year in the 3-year-program. Stephy is one of the graphic design team members, and she mostly spent her weeks finding the right companies for printing iGEM needs. Stephy is planning to go for further study in America or wherever outside Hong Kong.
What We Do that People Don't
Every Thursday, we have KOR103 course in MBMS lab, which is conducted by our leader, Chloe Eonni! Great, right? We learnt a lot! LOL ;D
Chloe Hyun Jung LEE
Chloe is a sophomore majoring in Biochemistry. She learned soooooooo much going through iGEM but it was also a really really stressful and tough process!!
Random things
She really doesn't understand why the Gibson Assembly for ACEB contruct did not work out. It should at least have the same number of colonies as the negative control, how can it have no colony at all!!! The Gibson Assembly mix certainly  affected the DNA fragments in some way... Is it possible that a gene is toxic to its native strain? Also, for BBa_J176171!! She confirmed that the linear plasmid is stable at 50°C but why can't it assemble with complementary sequences engineered in GFP? Can we really trust the sequence of this part? If this is heat sensitive, how can we confirm its sequence?
Astrid Sephira ALIM
Astrid is a sophomore at HKUST, and is studying Biochemistry and Cell Biology. Astrid works in sub-group 2 and mostly does the inoculation, which might be too many times so she got a new nickname, ""Inoculation girl""! For now, Astrid still has no clear plan at all after leaving HKUST, however she absolutely wants to go for further study or find something to do.
Cherished Lab Memories
** Astrid's sub group conversation. **
How to do the gel photo?
- Take your phone out.
- Unlock your phone.
- Choose the camera function button.
And, it is doonnneee! @#$%^&$^#&@
Raul Guillermo Medina CUELLAR
Don't let Raul's severe-looking appearance and intimidating silence deceive you: he is the nicest guy on earth! As soon as he gets to know you, he will start taking care of you as if you were a little brother/sister! His great passions are biology, chemistry and all that has to do with those fields (Don't get him started on synthetic biology!!) His bright future definitely lies within the walls of a lab!
Raul's You-Ought-to-Know:
HE IS A PRO AT TERRIBLE KNOCK-KNOCK JOKES!!! (Don't ever let him tell you one; if you are a normal person, you'll probably be scarred for life.)
Derek Ka Long CHU
Derek is a second year student studying Biochemistry. He is interested in doing research and wants to explore his options in it.

TEAM SPIRIT!
Our team consists of thirteen bright undergrads, working eagerly for nine months, transforming our project design into reality. With the kind help of our advisors and instructors, we managed to make the most of our time. We learned, grew and bonded together over the (mostly) stressful hours of digestion, gel electrophoresis, PCR and ligation. These are the people with whom we celebrated when things went right, and who propped us up when things were less than right. We wanted you to know them and us better. Don't be afraid to say HI if you see us in the Regional Jamboree. Who knows, maybe we might end up doing research together in the future!

iGEM Team TU-Munich 2013
Experimental measurements
All experiments and measurements were conducted by student members of the iGEM Team TU-Munich 2013 . The team could build on the knowledge of Jeffery Truong, Ingmar Polte and Katrin Fischer who had already participated in last year's competition and already knew the most important techniques and the laboratory. They implemented the lab management from last year from the first moment on, such as our extensive Labjournal .  For the first usage of instruments we obtained an introduction into the lab techniques by an instructor. Measurement itself and the evaluation of the obtained data were done by us.
LC-MS Measurements
The LC-MS measurements were performed to confirm the successful degradation of pollutants by effector proteins which were produced recombinantly or which were expressed by transgenic moss plants. Here we contacted Prof. Dr. Thomas Hofmann, who already helped us in our last year's iGEM project with the detection of caffeine and xanthohumole. The responsible team member for the LC-MS was in both years Ingmar Polte who performed the degradation experiments, established the contact to Prof. Hofmann and brought the samples to the Chair for Molecular Sensory . At the chair, the student members Ingmar Polte or Andreas-David Brunner contacted the operator of the mass spectrometer (Mr. Friederich or Dr. Stark) with whose they did the sample preparation, the actual measurements and the data evaluation.
ESI-TOF Measurements
In order to confirm the correctness of recombinant proteins they were analyzed in the ESI-TOF mass spectrometer, which is present at our hosting laboratory. For this purpose a student team member did the sample preparation, calculated the theoretical mass using the AutoAnnotator and brought the samples to Andreas Reichert who is a doctoral student at the chair and is responsible for the ESI-TOF mass spectrometer. He measured the samples together with a student team member and showed us the deconvolution of the primary data.
Fluorescense Microscopy
All fluorescense microscopy experiments were performed at the Chair for Plant Developmental Biology (Prof. Dr. Schneitz) as plants (and especially P. patens) exhibit a strong autofluorescence caused by the photosystem. Therefore an advanced microscope with appropriate filters is absolutely necessary which we could use at the Chair for Plant Developmental Biology. The experiments were performed by our student member Dong-Jiunn Jeffery Truong who has worked during his bachelor thesis with fluorescense microscopy over several weeks and was therefore an essential experimentator for this part of the project. An introduction to the microscopes was given by Dr. Prasad Vaddepalli.
Transformation of Physcomitrella patens
The transformation of Physcomitrella patens was one of the main concerns when we thought about working with Physcomitrella as it might cause some trouble which can only be handled by using the appropriate equipment and the advises of an experienced researcher. Therefore we contacted Prof. Dr. Reski (Freiburg University, 350 km distance) in May and could win him as an advisor for our team. After traveling several times to Freiburg we could perform the transformations in his lab. For this purpose we brought all buffers and the sterile linearized DNA from Munich and performed the transformation under the instructions of Dr. Gertrud Wiedemann. All steps of the transformation were conducted by student team members as it can be seen in our Transformation Results section.
Outreach
The introduction video for our team created during this competition, was designed, produced and cut by the student team member Katrin Fischer.
The group photos of our team were created by the press office of the TUM.
Laboratory of Prof. Dr. Skerra
The research group at the Chair of Biological Chemistry at TUM works in the field of biochemical protein engineering and design with a focus on therapeutic proteins and their application. The three main fields of research are (1) the development of anticalins which is an alternative binding scaffold and which are a promising alternative for conventional antibodies (2) the extension of the plasma half-life of therapeutic proteins using a poly-peptide polymer and (3) the site-specific conjugation of therapeutic proteins. Thus the focus of our hosting laboratory is biomedical engineering whereas our iGEM topic shows no intersection with this topic.
The single negligible exception is that we used a higher engineered anticalin (<partinfo>K1159003</partinfo>) to bind fluorescein in our BioAccumulation subproject, compared to the conventional BioBrick (<partinfo>BBa_K157004</partinfo>). This higher engineered version has three additional amino acid exchanges and exhibits a 75-fold higher affinity for its binding partner (fluorescein). It was not essential to have this higher engineered version for our project but we wanted to supply the registry with this improved part.
Beside this plasmid, we also obtained a plasmid for the TEV protease from the chair which we have used to generate the Split-TEV protease ( BBa_K1159100 , BBa_K1159101 and BBa_K1159102 ).
Prof. Skerra kindly provided us with space in his laboratory, and generously advanced us money to pay for team registration, travel expenses and laboratory resources. Moreover he participated approximately one a month in our team meetings and advised us on our project.
Technical University Munich
As we had to cover several different scientific aspects during our project we contacted several professors from our university to get their opinion on our plans, obtain reagents or access to measuring instruments such as mass spectrometers or microscopes.
Laboratory of Prof. Dr. Helmreich
Sanitary Environmental Engineering is a horizontal discipline comprised of civil engineering, process engineering and chemistry/biology. Research and teaching include the fields of water supply, sewage and rain water treatment, water quality and the modeling of aquatic systems.
In our interview with Prof. Helmreich, she explained us several characterization techniques to assess water quality. Furthermore she kindly provided us with water samples from sewage treatment plants.
Laboratory of Prof. Dr. Thomas Hofmann
The chair of Food Chemistry and Molecular Sensory Science at the Technische Universität München (TUM) comprises an international research team with a focus on chemosensory active biomolecules (sensomics), metabolomics & nutritional biomarker discovery, as well as stable isotope labeling studies.
The chair gave us great support in form of the detection of degraded pollutans via LCMS.
Laboratory of Prof. Dr. Langosch
The Chair for Chemistry of Biopolymers focuses on the structural biochemistry of integral membrane proteins. Core themes are molecular interactions between membrane proteins, structural dynamics of membrane bound protein helices, membrane protein/lipid interactions and structure/function relationships of integral membrane protein complexes.
During the planning phase of our project we asked Prof. Langosch for advice concerning the design of the transmembrane domain of our constructs.
Laboratory of Prof. Dr. Rost
Prof. Rost works in the field of bioinformatics and computer-based biology, focusing on the prediction of structure and function of proteins and genes. His team's specialty is the use of artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms to predict structure and function of proteins.
After developing an early version of our AutoAnnotator , we presented our work to Prof. Rost and his group. He gave us some very helpful advice on features we could add and provided us with access to his PredictProtein server. A special ""thank you"" goes to Manfred Roos for tailoring the access point of the server to our needs.
Laboratory of Prof. Dr. Schneitz
The Chair for Plant Developmental Biology is interested in the genetic and molecular basis of the regulatory pathways controlling organ development and tissue morphogenesis in plants.
The chair gave us great access to their microscopes and excellent support in how to use them. Many thanks for that, especially to Prasad Vaddepalli for his introduction into fluorescence microscopy.
Laboratory of Prof. Dr. Schwechheimer
The Chair for Systems Biology of Plants investigates a range of queries concerning the ubiquitin proteasome system of plants applying a combination of genetics, molecular biology and cell biology with both genomic and proteomic approaches.
Together with Prof. Schwechheimer we discussed several different signal transduction pathways that could be utilised for our kill-switch . Moreover he kindly granted us access to a fluorescence microscope.
Laboratory of Prof. Dr. Scherer
The Chair for microbial ecology conducts basic research in the field of molecular genetics and ecology of pathogenic microorganisms. Projects include the microbial characterization of food  and microbial diagnostics and consulting in the food industry for prevention and clearance of contaminations.
The team kindly provided us with a culture of Micrococcus luteus for the Kirby-Bauer assay and also helped out with a tube of restriction enzyme during an unexpected shortage.
Other Universities
The team also obtained help from other universities in order to complete the project. As nobody at our university works with Physcomitrella patens which the team chose to work with we had to find an advisor who could support us with the transformation procedure which is not really simple for plants. Additionally researches from other universities helped us by providing plasmids.
Laboratory of Prof. Dr. Reski at Freiburg University (Germany)
The team at the Chair for Plant Biotechnology is working on gene expression in the bryophyte model plant Physcomitrella patens (Hedw.) B.S.G. at different levels in correlation with phenotype analysis and additionally employs comparative genomic approaches.
The Reski team kindly supported us by supervising our moss transformations at their lab and by allowing us to use some of their equipment and materials for the process. Our special thanks go to Dr. Gertrud Wiedemann .
Laboratory of Prof. Dr. Fussenegger at ETH Zurich (Switzerland)
The research group at the Chair for Biotechnology and Bioengineering is implementing a progress in basic research to achieve generic and prototypic advances in human therapy by focusing on mammalian cells and capitalizing on an integrated interdisciplinary systems approach. Their current research initiatives include several programs interfacing with biopharmaceutical manufacturing, gene therapy and tissue engineering.
They kindly provided us with the pSH21 plasmid which was used as template for the Polioviral Internal Ribosome Entry Site ( BBa_K1159300 ).
Laboratory of Dr. G.D. Wright  at McMaster University (Canada)
The Wright Lab is trying to understand fundamental aspects of how antibiotics work, their sources and how bacteria become resistant to them.
They kindly provided us with the plasmids pDEST14_ereA and pDEST14_ereB which was used as a template for the Erythromycin Esterase Type II (<partinfo>BBa_K1159000</partinfo>).
Laboratory of Prof. Dr. Arndt  at Potsdam University (Germany)
The team at the Chair for Molecular Biotechnology investigates the factors that mediate interactions in coiled-coil proteins in order to target coiled-coil domains of proteins e.g. involved in tumorigenesis, tumor proliferation and metastasis.
Sven Hagen who had participated several times in iGEM in the past kindly provided us with the pBad-mVenus (RFC 25) expression plasmid. This plasmid was used for the production of recombinant protein in E. coli.
Webdesign
The webdesign was entirely done by Florian Albrecht who has programmed different websites before. He also wrote the webdesign tutorial we put online to explain other teams how to use the code, developed by our team. The graphic elements used on the website were created by several different student members (such as Ingmar Polte, Katrin Fischer, Jeffery Truong, Rosario Ciccone and others) using the open source vector software Inkscape. The only component that was bought are the two direction signs used in the header (obtained from http://vector-images.de/clipart/clp217632 ).
normalize.css
Normalize.css was used to reset the wiki style (version used: 2.1.3).
jQuery
jQuery is a powerful JavaScript extension used by many Webdesigners (version used: 1.10.2).
jQuery UI
jQuery UI is a GUI extension of jQuery and was used for the datepicker on the Arduino data page (version used: 1.10.3).
History.js
History.js was used to ensure compatibility with HTML4 browsers, that do not support history.pushState().
Slimbox 2
Slimbox 2 was used as a picture viewer (version used: 2.05). The code had to be adapted to work with the wiki and bxSlider and we added a feature that fits the viewer to the browser size.
bxSlider
bxSlider is a JavaScript content slider and powers the slideshows and picture galleries on our wiki (version used: 4.1.1). The code was modified so all the images are scaled to the same height in gallery mode.
NVD3
NVD3 is a JavaScript chart library and was used for the interactive chart of the Arduino data (version used: 1.1.13).
Software - The AutoAnnotator
The software tool we have written to facilitate and improve the annotation of protein coding BioBricks (the AutoAnnotator ) was developed and programmed by the student member Christopher Wolf . He developed this idea himself to import, translate sequences and to compute important parameters. After this was completed he contacted the bioinformatics group of Prof. Rost and presented his idea and the program in a group seminar. In the seminar, ideas for further improvements were generated. The group advised Chrostopher to implement a bioinformatic module that does alignments to several databases and bioinformatic servers. The research group of Prof. Rost has a server that concentrates bioinformatic information and they enabled Christopher to use this tool. He implemented these information into the AutoAnnotator himself. It was also Chrostopher Wolf who has written the RFC 96 to describe the usage of the AutoAnnotator and who created the introduction video .
For further information please see our Software page .
James Padolsey
We used James Padolsey´s jQuery extension for Cross-domain AJAX requests in the AutoAnnotator.
Flot.js
Flot.js (see flotchart.org ) was used to draw the graphs in the AutoAnnotator and in the Filter Calculator.
Flot-AxisLabels
Flot-AxisLabels is an extension of Flot.js, adding axis labels to Flot.js.
Excanvas
Excanvas.js extends the <canvas>-tag to IE 8.0 and earlier, allowing the use of AutoAnnotator (in particular the plots) in these browsers.
Paul Johnston
We used the MD5 generator written by Paul Johnston to translate the amino acid sequences into MD5-hashs, which were used to obtain the predictions from the database of PredictProtein.org

Document the characterization of this part in the “Main Page” section of that Part’s/Device’s Registry entry:
See <partinfo>BBa_K1159000</partinfo>, <partinfo>BBa_K1159001</partinfo> as well as a series of other parts.
Submit this new part to the iGEM Parts Registry (submissions must adhere to the iGEM Registry guidelines):
See <partinfo>BBa_K1159000</partinfo>, <partinfo>BBa_K1159001</partinfo> as well as a series of other parts.
Your project may have implications for the environment, security, safety and ethics and/or ownership and sharing. Describe one or more ways in which these or other broader implications have been taken into consideration in the design and execution of your project:
See https://2013.igem.org/Team:TU-Munich/Project/Safety
Gold Criteria
Improve the function of an existing BioBrick Part or Device (created by another team or your own institution in a previous year), enter this information in the Registry (in the “Experience” section of that BioBrick’s Registry entry), create a new registry page for the improved part, and submit this part to the iGEM Parts Registry (submissions must adhere to the iGEM Registry guidelines).
We improved three previously existing parts:
Laccase: <partinfo>BBa_K863000</partinfo> to <partinfo>BBa_K1159002</partinfo>
We converted the part from RFC 10 to RFC 25.
FluA: <partinfo>BBa_K157004</partinfo> to <partinfo>BBa_K1159003</partinfo>
We submitted an engineered variant with three additional mutations which make it 75-times more affine to fluorescein (KD from 152 nM to 2 nM).
PP1: BBa_K1012001 to Part:BBa_K1159004
We converted the part from RFC 10 to RFC 25.
Help any registered iGEM team from another school or institution by, for example, characterizing a part, debugging a construct, or modeling or simulating their system.
We had close collaboration with the 2013 teams from Dundee and Paris-Saclay and exchanged Biobricks with the 2012 team from LMU Munich and the 2013 teams from Tübingen, Uppsala and Paris Saclay.  See: https://2013.igem.org/Team:TU-Munich/Team/Collaborations
Your project may have implications for the environment, security, safety and ethics and/or ownership and sharing. Describe a novel approach that your team has used to help you and others consider these aspects of the design and outcomes of synthetic biology efforts. Please justify its novelty and how this approach might be adapted and scaled for others to use.
We took a new approach to the problem of phytoremediation by introducing a new chassis to iGEM. We hope that this will serve as reference for future teams who work on bioremediation or related environmental problems. See Phytoremediation for more details.
We wrote three tutorials in order to help previous iGEM teams to program better wiki pages, create animated gifs from PDB protein structures and to use Arduino microcontrollers in their iGEM project.
We submitted RFC[96 ] to the BioBrick Foundation which describes the usage of the AutoAnnotator to increase the quality of part descriptions for protein coding BioBricks. This software translates the nucleotide sequence into amino acids, calculates several parameters and performs alignments against various data bases and finally provides all collected data in a standardized table which can easily be pasted into a part description.

Collaboration with Dundee iGEM team 2013
Figure 1: Shipment from the Dundee 2013 iGEM team.
The Dundee iGEM team 2013 also works on bioremediation: The toxin microcystin is released into water from lysed cyanobacteria and appears in great amounts during algal blooms. This cyclic peptide toxin covalently binds the protein phosphatase type 1 (PP1) and is thereby toxic for mammals. The idea of the Dundee iGEM team is to express the PP1 protein as an absorber for microcystin. We received their PP1 BioBrick, converted it from RFC 10 to RFC 25 and constructed some expression plasmids to transform Physcomitrella patens. Our purpose was applying Dundee's molecular mop in an aquatic, photoautotrophic chassis and thus expand their project's to a wider range. We  successfully obtained equipped the moss plants with our synthetic moss receptor and extracellular PP1. Please visit our PhyscoFilter results page to read more about this great collaboration.
We'd also like to congratulate the Dundee iGEM team 2013 for their success at the European Jamboree: Well done Scots!

Figure 3: Bubbling flask with our moss. This is how the moss would circulate in the bubble column reactor.
We contacted the Glowing Plant Team which has set itself the goal to develop glowing transgenic A. thaliana plants using luciferase based on the work of iGEM Cambridge 2010 . They were quite interested in our idea using transgenic moss plants as light source and we agreed on a meeting on October 25th. Ahead of the European Jamboree (October 7 th they have also posted our project video on their blog in order to promote it. We would love to see glowing Physcomitrella plants in the future.
Glowingplant performed an extremely successful kickstarter campaign to raise money for their idea of plants which gather energy by photosynthesis and emit it again later by bioluminescence.
On the 25th of October we had the great chance to meet Antony Evans of the glowingplant team on his visit to Europe. After having talked about the current status of our projects we had a great knowledge exchange about legal regulations, the public opinion on transgenic plants in Europe and in the US as well as about the potential sizes of the market for transgenic plants for home use. We intend to intensify our collaboration in the fashion of testing their gen cassette used for the luciferase reaction in our moss. It would be interesting to check how the utilized promoters for A. thaliana work in our moss P. patens. However we plan to build a new gene construct using our tested Actin 5 promotor from Physcomitrella.
Maybe one day our moss will be usable to enlighten our living environment in aerated lava lamps like the one shown in figure 2. Having explored the scientific opportunities of our moss for this purpose glowingplant could become an extremely valuable partner on the way to a commercial product.
Collaboration with Paris-Saclay iGEM team 2013
Figure 4: Screenshot from our Skype conference with the Paris Saclay team.
The Paris_Saclay iGEM team is working on the detection and degradation of polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) in the context of bioremediation. We arranged a Skype-meeting, presented our projects to each other and agreed to exchange some of our coded BioBricks. The goal of that exchange was to test the new BioBricks in different chassis.
Collaboration with Op.N
Figure 5: An architects vision of our remediation rafts
When we wondered how a moss filter could be implemented, we came across the NY PARALLEL NETWORKS concept which was designed by Op.N (Ali Fard and Ghazal Jafari). Op.N's work considers ""critical junction of architecture, landscape, and urban processes"". The design and research practice is based in Cambridge and Toronto. Ali Fard and Ghazal Jafari are researchers at Harvard Graduate School of Design.
We got in touch via E-Mail and found Ali and Ghazal interested in our ideas and willing to allow us the usage of their image material used at the ONE PRIZE competition.

The TU-Munich iGEM team 2013
Figure 1: Group picture
This year's iGEM team is a quite interdisciplinary group consisting of students and advisors from the subjects Biochemistry, Molecular Biotechnology, Engineering and Mathematics. The team-forming was initiated by three students and two instructors who already participated in last year´s iGEM team and who were looking for enthusiastic fellow campaigners to participate in iGEM 2013. The result was a team, consisting of 10 students and 3 instructors, willing to participate in a great contribution to the competition. To bridge the gap between old and new team members, we visited several folk festivals (luckily we're quite blessed with them in the greater Munich area) and had dinners together. The result was a dynamic group with fruitful relationships between the group members. Thus we have a very enjoyable working atmosphere and hopefully an equally successful participation in the iGEM competition.
We are very lucky and deeply grateful having the chance to work in the laboratory of Prof. Dr. Arne Skerra, who holds the Chair of Biological Chemistry at the Technical University of Munich. The team had full access to all laboratory equipment that was needed to realize our PhyscoFilter project. Without the help and support of Prof. Dr. Arne Skerra and his Team the project in its present form would not have been possible.
Student Members
Andreas-David Brunner
Codename:
Master of QuikChange
Field of Study:
Molecular Biotechnology
Semester:
Bachelor 4th Semester
What kind of character do you need to get a “master” grade in the 4th bachelor's semester? Due to his amount of perfect processed Quikchanges, with his diligence and inexorable endurance, Andi really deserved his codename as “Master of Quickchange”. For advancing our project in different fields, including establishing and maintaining the contact between different iGEM Teams, Andi is one of our connecting persons who travelled for example through four cities within 3 days. Next to this, Andi is a very cooperative, high flying and humorous character. In the end of our project his power was mainly invested in the preparation, execution and planning of the Educational-Kits and performing the experiment to prove the existence of cut-off membrane constructs.
Christopher Wolf
Codename:
Wolverine
Field of Study:
Mathematics
(Cambridge University)
Semester:
Bachelor 6th semester
Christopher just recently finished his Bachelor's Degree in Mathematics at the University of Cambridge this summer. In the team he mainly took care of modeling and programming tasks, but beyond that he also showed a genuine interest in the work in the lab. This enabled him to make even more essential contributions to the project as he was able to solve biological problems as well as disputes in the team from his mathematical perspective.
Dong-Jiunn Jeffery Truong
Codename:
24/7-Jeff
Field of Study:
Molecular Biotechnology
Semester:
Master 3rd semester
Former participation in:
TU_Munich 2012
Motto:
The happier we get,
the less we see.
If I would just have three words to describe Jeff, these words would be: What a Gen(e)ious!!! There is nobody in the team who can mess with him on DNA-Level. His enthusiasm for the project goes so far, that he can sleep 3 hours per night – one week straight, when there is urgent work to be done. After getting in touch with the idea of iGEM, Jeffery was immediately infected by the idea of synthetic biology. He has a keen interest in optogenetics and signaling, which made him the perfect fit to work on our safety mechanism. Besides to his enormous wisdom, he is one of the most uncomplicated and down-to-earth people we ever got acquainted with.
Florian Albrecht
Codename:
Floh
Field of Study:
Molecular Biotechnology
Semester:
Bachelor 4th semester
Motto:
Coca Cola is my water!
His extraordinary skills in nearly every situation enrich the team enormously. Lab, programing and mechanical skills are just some to mention. Florian is a reflective person, who is just talking as much as needed, nevertheless he is always up for a funny claim. As a consequence to his versatility he was especially involved in programming our wiki, building of filter prototypes and purifying proteins, if necessary the whole night long. One of his special characteristics is his coca cola consumption, true to the motto: “Coca Cola is my water!”
Ingmar Polte
Codename:
47000 xg -Polte
Field of Study:
Molecular Biotechnology
Semester:
Bachelor 6th semester
Former participation:
TU_Munich 2012
Motto:
We need more rpm!!!
At first glance Ingmar seems to be wrong in the laboratory, because you can easily mix him up with a manager of a joint-stock company, but at second glance you recognize him being the “Usain Bolt” of the laboratory. There is nothing which can not be managed and organized by him until time is used optimally, even if he is forced to run between the photo laboratory (first floor) checking a result of a gel electrophoresis and heat-shocking bacteria of a transformation (ground floor) in parallel. Ingmar is always motivated, helping in every situation as good as he can and managed to finish his bachelors thesis in Bioprocess Engineering besides iGEM. Last but definitely not least, we have to mention a hobby of Ingmar, which is called: “Destroy Falcon Tubes in an ultra-centrifuge at 47000 xg during a midi-prep and still try to extract the plasmid-pellet!”
Johanna Brueggenthies
Codename:
The Gel
Field of Study:
Biochemistry
Semester:
Bachelor 4th semester
Johanna is the “Sunshine” of our labteam, who always has a positive attitude, spreads good feelings in the lab and is always ready for a laugh. Next to her precise work in the lab she was responsible for advancing our project in different fields including establishment and maintenance of the downright good contact between different iGEM teams. Johanna is one of our connecting persons who traveled several times through Germany, for example to Berlin, to participate at the „Biotechnology 2020+ Conference of the Ministry of Research and Education“. In addition to her successfully carried out moss transformation in Freiburg Johanna played a key role in the constructive expansion of our human practice work. Her communicative and friendly nature was extremely helpful to win selveral experts for interviews. Near to the end of our project, she ardently worked ambitious on writing articles for the wiki which was a great contribution to the project and really helped us finishing the wiki in a timely fashion.
Katrin Fischer
Codename:
Microwave-Katrin
Field of Study:
Biochemistry
Semester:
Bachelor 4th semester
Former participation:
TU_Munich 2012
There is the rumor that Katrin snatched Hermiones Time-Turner, as she manages to hold a students job in a lab group and is successfully studying Biochemistry while working hard for iGEM. Katrin is a very focused and thoughtful person, who has the right ideas at the right time. If you got the chance to admire our team poster at the „Biotechnology 2020+ Conference of the Ministry of Research and Education“ in Berlin, you were admiring the work of Katrin. Her skills in using graphic applications are superlative and were mixed up with the work of a trained illustrator. Her lab skills and graphics experience really pushes the team to new boundaries.
Louise Funke
Codename:
Dances with Wolves
Field of Study:
Biochemistry
Semester:
Bachelor 4th semester
Motto:
Come on!
Although Louise is only in her 4th semester, with the lab experience she earned during a voluntary internship at the Biochemistry faculty at Cambridge University, she is able to work independently and with great efficiency. With her precise lab work and incredible dedication she propels our project forward, keeping track of any loose ends. When experiments failed, she always cheered the team up with her infectious smile and reminded us to keep the big picture in mind. In our team her main responsibility was the enzyme EreB, its characterization and in vivo experiments.
Philipp Schneider
Codename:
Phil-no-Mitrella
Field of Study:
Engineering
Semester:
Bachelor 6th semester
iGEM-Motto:
Desoxyri....whaat?!
Philipp is an Engineering student, who finishes his bachelor thesis this winter. Although he virtually had no real contact with the subject, he showed great interest in synthetic biology. Sometimes it was hard for him to follow our conversations about gene design and protein interactions, but he was a quick learner and in turn he could teach us a lot about engineering principles we did not know about!
Rosario Ciccone
Codename:
Eagle Eye
Field of Study:
Biochemistry
Semester:
Bachelor 4th semester
Motto:
Pew, pew, pew!
Rosario is a very friendly and helpful person, who mini-prepped more bacteria than the whole team together during iGEM. It is the first time for him participating in this competition and working on a project independently besides university. As you may mention referring to his name, Rosario is half Italian, half German, but representing the real Italian spirit, gesticulating and talking loudly if he is upset or enthusiastic about a new idea. His laugh is absolutely intoxicating, which is always creating an enjoyable atmosphere. Towards the end of the project, Rosario was mainly occupied with the purification of our effector proteins, to be sure that we are performing our experiments and characterizations with non contaminated proteins.

Advisors
Dr. Meike Meißner
Position: Coordinator of the degree course Molecular Biotechnology at TU Munich, Weihenstephan
Field of Study: Biology (graduated)
Meike is the coordinator of the degree course „Molecular Biotechnology“ at the Wissenschaftszentrum Weihenstephan (WZW) of the Technical University of Munich and supports us during iGEM as much as she can. Due to her position as contact person for the degree course, she had a good sense for infighting in the team, which she always approached and solved.
Prof. Dr. Ralf Reski
Prof. Dr. Reski is a German professor for plant biotechnology and former dean of the biology faculty at Albert-Ludwig University, Freiburg . His research of genetics, proteins, metabolism and peculiarities of moss cell development uses the highly efficient homologous recombination for the production of knockout moss in order to investigate unknown genes and their functions with a prospect on potential applications in agriculture and forestry. Prof. Reski´s research also includes the production of complex biopharmaceuticals in moss bioreactors (molecular farming) and he co-founded the Greenovation Biotech GmbH. He also created the International Moss Stock Center (IMSC) , a biobank that stores and distributes moss plants from all around the world.
Dr. Gertrud Wiedemann
Dr. Gertrud Wiedemann is a postdoc at the Reski plant biotechnology lab. She kindly took the time and patience to teach us the protoplast transformation method, supervised both our transformation sessions and advised us on procedure details.

Team 2013 SYSU-CHINA is composed of 15 young members, all senior students from biology, biochemistry and mathematical science at Sun Yat-sen University. Forming on October 2012, this team has created the device called iPSCs Safeguard and partly tested it, and did several human practices.  A group of greenhands as we are, we cherish each mistake we've made, enjoy every moment we've spent together, and deeply appreciate every friend who has ever helped us!
Team Members
Sun Mengyi
He is the leader of the team. He played an important role in purposing the idea this year, and did some chores to help the designers of molecular experimental work. A crazy nerd for science as he is, he reads a lot of books in different fields. His countless interesting stories about hundreds of scientists really broadened our horizons.
Zhao Yuchen
She is another leader of the team. She played an important role in perfecting this idea, and did most of our cell stable transfections in several cell lines, including iPS cells, Hep G2 cells, and hepatocytes. Besides the experiments, quarreling with Mengyi about the ideas and experiments and everything is another work she did everyday.
Chen Haoqi
He is the designer of most parts involving miRNA-122 and TRE elements. He did a lot of quantative work such as qRT-PCR and western blot. He also helped Yiming to accomplish the biobrick construction. Nice and gentle, he is absolutely the positive buffer of the team member relationship.
Lin Kaixuan
She did most of the transient infection experiments in cells, she tested each of our elements and got great data for modeling. Making a important contribution in designing the idea, she is also the professional writer of scientific articles, making our idea more clear and rigorous. she has burned a lot of midnight oil this summer for this project.
He Dawei
He is the designer of the tet system parts involving EF-1alpha , tTA and rtTA. He played an important role in discussion and designing of the idea this year. He also helped YiMing to accomplish the construction of biobricks. He is so shy that we never succeeded in catching a photo snapshot when he was looking at the camera.
Fang YiMing
He took part in constructing the part involving EF-1alpha, tTA and rtTA. He did the construction of biobrick. As the leader in Debate Team for more than three years, he is the trump card of our presentation.
Luo YingJie
She constructed some circuits involving TRE response element, and got important material for teams, like the plasmid involving TRE 3G. She had been actively involved in discussion about the idea.
Zheng Yuqing
She was the creator of most of the pictures, cartoon, flash and Powerpoint in this team. She magically turned our logo, wiki , poster, presentation, team shirt into fantastic arts. She even kept drawing in the hospital, with her right hand, while her left hand was given an injection for her temperature as high as 39.4 degrees Celsius.
Fang Chao
He is our super boss for wiki on-line construction, poster design, logo design and badge design. All the beautiful team photos are taken by him. He is a lovely guy with a strong sense of humor. Watching him cooperating with Yuqing is one of most interesting thing in this world. Thank him for those delicious food he shared with us in those days.
Xie Tianyuan
She is a member from school of mathematical science and responsible for the modeling work. She is a hardworking and rigorous guy who builded the model of our project, providing us with a different view of science.
Yang Ziyi
Another member from shcool of mathematical science, he is a pretty shy and smart boy. Not mastering much knowledge about biology before, he quickly catched up with our design and finally offered us with a model which was totally beyond our expectation.
Ji Changyang
He made a huge contribution for idea discussion. He helped the teams in every aspect, including the design of wiki, the molecular works, and the logistics. He is also an activator of brainstorming. For many times, his warm temper eased the conflicts in the team discussing about ideas.
Yang Zongying
He is the steward of the team, solving the problems about fund and logistics. It is he who made us do our work without worrying about the other complicated but necessary things. He is absolutely the standard of ""tall, rich and handsome"".
Yao Runwen
He is a reliable assistant of cell work. He provided us with the most important paper that triggered others in the team to come up with the idea. Without his help, the isolation and primary culture of hepatocytes would hardly succeed. He will play an important role in next year’s competition. Besides, his outrageous high GPA is absolutely an positive energy for the whole team=.=.
Zhang Mingxuan
She is a reliable assistant of molecular cloning. She gave us constructive advices when we were facing problems. At spare time her hobby was laughing at our leader Mengyi, which became the funny drama for the rest of us. : ) She will play an important role in next year's competition.
Zeng Jianhua, Xie Yanwen, Tang Wei,
Zhao Xiaoyu ,Li  Luyao
They actively engaged in the discussion and brainstorming, and helped us a lot in Human Practice. They will also be the strong power of SYSU-iGEM next year.
Advisor
Jiang Shuai
He is our super advisor of the team. He provided us with firmly technical support about our experiment design. It is he who always couraged and helped us to overcome most of obstacles we've met in project. Without his professional knowledge and highly experimental skills about iPS, the experiments we did in mouse iPS and human iPS would be nothing but impossible. He made our idea more clear and beautiful.
Instructor
Lu Yongjun
He is one of the dean of School of Life Sciences. Our super boss. Our super funds supporter. :) He loves his students as his own children and makes SYSU-iGEM team become normalized. He's face, which is so similiar with Yamanaka's, also gave us a inspiration spark of our project idea this year: iPSC Safeguard. (Just kidding :D
Huang Junjiu
He is a young professor in Stem Cell and Functional Genomics Laboratory in Sun Yat-sen University. He offered us with most of the experimental spaces, equipment and materials. He also gave us a lot suggestions on our idea. Thank him for standing with his office in a total mess for such a long time because of us.
Xu Hui
He is both a young professor and a pre-father who provided us with a lot of experimental suggestions and materials such as Hep G2 cell lines and some essential plasmids. Due to his abundant knowledge of miRNA mechanism and molecular cloning, he gave us the most important suggest in constructing our circuit. Besides, it's very much likely that the day when we are in Hong Kong will be the day he finally turns into a happy father.
He Xionglei
A lovely and young professor of character. Always adored by us students for his special ideas, he added some creativity and great foresight to this team. His wonderful speech in our human practice talk gave everybody a deep impression.

Advisor(1)
Dr. Chong ZHANG received his B.Sc. and Ph.D. in chemical engineering at Department of Chemical Engineering, Tsinghua University in 2002 and 2008, respectively. His current research projects aim at synthetic biology in the field of biochemical engineering including:
(1) Basic principles and methods of synthetic biology for the construction of novel enzymes, microbial cell factories and microbial consortia with new functions for industrial applications;
(2) The application of synthetic biology in the bio-synthesis of chiral chemicals, novel cofactor regeneration systems, bioconversion of methanol to isoprene and bioconversion of low-grade biomass to hydrogen and methane.
Instructors(2)
Weifan LIANG
Hi, I am weifan majored in biochemical engineering and it is my 3rd year in graduate study. As an instructor of the team, I guide them to finish the experiment. And now I am always deeply moved by their persistence and hard working. They have carried out experience overnight many times to accelerate progress and they well finish their division. Hoping for the great result in iGEM.
Tianmin WANG
I'm Tainmin Wang, PhD 2th year student in Tsinghua majored in metabolic engineering. Great for me to be the instructor for this passional team. We are really a team that everyone works for our goal and at the same time enjoys the fun of synthetic biology. We made a fantastic story in this summer and I hope everyone will enjoy it during the Jamboree in Hong Kong or even MIT. We are coming!
Team Members(14)
Hi, I am Yinan WU, the team leader, and I am going to be a senior student majored in chemical engineering. Owing to my experience in the bio chemical laboratory for about one year, I have some knowledge of traditional biological chemical industry. And thanks to iGEM, I know more about synthetic biology. My main work during this summer is to do the experiment. I have a hand in the structure and representation of the parts.
Hi, I am Yijun ZHANG,and I am going to be a senior student majored in life science. I'm familiar with traditional bio experiments, for I spent my junior year in a lab working on cell biology. And as a member of our iGEM team, I know more about synthetic biology. During experiments, I was always surprised by the interesting results. I really enioy the procedure of genetically engineering our E.coli to achieve amazing function. Hope our creation will also amaze you all!
Hi, I am Mingyuan DU majored in chemical engineering and I am going to have my 3rd year in Tsinghua University. I am the main supervisor of our cute little story about the microorganism --- including the play, the characters, the designing and finally the video. After the whole process, I picked up my confidence and was finally able to speak out loud that I am a capable person who enjoys challenges and difficulties.
I'm Zijian GUO and I'm major in Fundamental Science of Chemistry and Biology. Now it's my final year of my bachelor degree. Everything related to biology and chemistry and their interdisciplinary turns me on and I want to be a scientist in the next 10 years. After that, I'm not sure. Maybe running a café? Cooking is just another version of experiment, isn't it? For this IGEM project, I focus more on the parts design and experiment. It is nice to have such a friendly team to work in. And the exploring during the project is as fascinating as you can expect. I hope that our story could catch your attention.
I am Shude LIU from Tsinghua University, institute of chemical engineering. I feel very lucky to be a part of our IGEM team---THU-E, which focuses on the in vivo evolution for microbial cell factory. I used to think that Darwin’s theory of evolution just happen naturally without the interference of human being. But through our project, I realized that the process can actually be accurately designed and controlled by us, providing a promising way to evolve overproduction microbe. And I strongly believe that one day we can make the process of artificial evolution to be continuous, making it more accurate and controllable.
Hi! I’m Tianhui MA, a senior-to-be student majored in chemical engineering while minored in economy. Joining our iGEM team has been one of the most correct choices I have made in college since from here I’ve got the real feeling of being a part of a team and the understanding of the concept of cooperation as well as competition. As a novice, the primary part I am in charge with is the designing and actualizing of our wiki. Sharing ideas with my coworkers is like watching a firework show --- the infinite sparkles of innovations.
I am Beiduo RAO majored in chemical engineering and I am supposed to have my last year in Tsinghua University as an undergraduate students. I applied for this iGEM in an attempt to broaden knowledge of not only theoretical but also practical Biochemistry to which I have a plan to devote in the future. I always enjoy the happy time in the lab doing experiments. It makes me feel proud of myself, especially in terms of operational ability, and figure out a new definition of myself in the harmony of this team.
Hi! I’m Hao SUN and I am going to be a sophomore once more time in the coming new semester. Please hang on a second if you were considering me as a bad student with poor grades. Things became both complicated and simple after I joined our iGEM team. Though majored in ChemE, I am the leader of the programming part. As confused as I’ve got with the larger and larger gap between my status quo --- a student majored in chemical engineering --- and my real talent and interest --- computer and programming, my dream hiding in the bottom of my heart is becoming clearer and clearer and finally up to the surface. I changed my major to computer science and thanks to iGEM, I find me the true self this time.
Hi, I’m Hewei TANG a senior student majored in Chemical Engineering. I enjoy the whole procedure of taking part in this awesome IGEM team and working with my fellow teammates. Taking in charge of Human Practice, I find a brand new perspective to appreciate synthetic biology and what it can do for our life. I hope that synthetic biology can be a widely accepted concept one day and that everybody can know how it will make a difference.
Hi, here is Han WANG, a junior student majored in chemical engineering. Tasks in our iGEM team are strenuous and at the same time challenging and enjoyable. As a sophomore last year, I had not tried doing a research, and was entirely confused with the sophisticated equipments in our lab at first. It is really fascinating to take a comparison between the past me and the person I am now. Though still frustrated with not-so-ideal results, I am skilled with the operation in our lab and surrounded by the passion about the competition and biochemistry much stronger when I decided to join the team.
Hi, I’m Yifan WEI and I am going to be a 3rd year student majored in Biology next semester. To fight in our team is a great glory to me. Maybe I can be called “Main Tank” in our lab work. I am the one who has been working in the lab for the longest time in our team and the one who obtained the most techniques in our team to aid the process of the experiment. I made my progress and was able to control the experiment independently. In the later period, I was even in charge of the characterization of the part “Bitter Pressure” without other teammates’ help.
Hi, here is Zhenlin ZHAO, I am primarily in charge of human practice. Games and Biochemistry are two of my favorite things in, probably, my whole life. In the middle of a discussion with the team, an idea struck me that computer game themed synthesis biology might be a perfect marriage between them and an efficient way to publicize the idea of iGEM. And then there born our iGEM game for human practice. Along the process of making this game, I have found not only so many interesting ideas and astonishing achievements of the iGEM precursors but also my passion in biochemistry.
Hi, I’m Pengji ZHOU and I am in my 3rd year of studying chemical engineering. What fascinate me most is the boundless possibilities existing in genetic engineering and how iGEM make it possible to gather numerous brilliant ideas all over the world. That is the main reason for my initially applying the team. But soon, I have found that our team is much more than that: the cooperation and encouragement is what keeps me and us holding on to our ultimate goal.
Hi, I am Wenming ZHU majored in chemical engineering. I am going to enjoy my 3rd year in Tshinghua University and how lucky I am to get the chance of being a team member in iGEM! Just like how I devote my passion into sports, I love the feel of challenge and achievement along the process of preparing for the final competition. No matter the experiments, the designing of our loge and T-shirts or solving technical problem concerning our wiki, I am willing and capable to nail them as long as my passion do not extinguish. Thanks to iGEM, never did I have the strong and real feeling of being alive as youth!

We have thought of this project by ourselves, so it was not an assignment from one of our supervisors. The supervisors and advisors main role was providing consultancy. All the design, labwork and modeling was done by the team itself and started in June. We also took care of the sponsoring, other organizational issues and made our own presentations and poster.
The silk that we have developed was based on the article of Brooks et al. [1], but the codon optimization was executed by the team itself using software written by one of the team members. We improved the backbone made by the iGEM team from Munich in 2012 and used this backbone for our constructs. Also, we validated that biobrick BBa_E0840 works in Bacillus subtilis (Figure 1).
The coating mechanism was developed by the team using article [2][3][4]. The knockout strains were shipped from the university of Illinois and Buenos Aires .
Figure 1: The intensity in of ~40 cells in the GFP-channel, were analyzed from two pictures. The average intensity (AU) from the cells are plotted above with the standard deviation. A GFP from our group is shown and in a biobricked GFP (BBa_E0840) is shown in a plot. wt=wildtype, T0= before induction, T1,2,3=#h of induction with IPTG.

Role
Chairman
Background
Bachelor in Health (Radiographer, currently Master Biomedical Engineering
Bio
Erik Jan is a second year Biomedical Engineer. Eventually his goal is to be a medical physicist.            He decided to join iGEM after he heard about it from last years team. Synthetic biology can be close to Biomedical Engineering and this was a good opportunity to get some experience. Because Biomedical Engineering in Groningen does nothing close to the field of synthetic biology. He is the chairman of the team and is busy organizing a lot of stuff, tries to keep track of everything we do, works on the wiki a lot and helps where ever he can. Besides his studies he works part-time as a teacher and loves to sail and go scuba diving.

Probiotics: iGEM contribution
We went to the most important congress about probiotics in Mexico City, to a competition of scientific posters. In this competition our poster was about the different iGEM contributions, about probiotics, in the last five years. We did this in order to inform the people in our country about the advances of the synthetic biology, how this can help to solve illness and other important problems.
During this event we met and dialogue with the Dr. Mariano García Garibay director of biological sciences and health from UAM, and asked him what is the most important issue missing in modern probiotics? He replied that modern probiotics should not be directed in a general way because today the commercial ones do not have a specific function, this means that they do not attack a particular problem which should be treated with this tools. So the main objective of modern probiotics must be to fight specific problems of the public health which also can increase its commercial value in the market. A specialized function for a probiotic is what needs to be improved in order to ameliorate some of the most important health problems, and make it easier for people to take care of their health.
Similarly we had the opportunity to converse with the President of Yakult Mexico about the importance that the synthetic biology has in the probiotics and the big development of this in other countries, and how this advances and investigations will beneficially Mexico and the mexicans in a closed future . Also we talked about the iGEM competition and explained to him the projects of probiotics and how the combination of Engineering and Biology will help to create new systems, applicable to the development of intelligent, efficient and harmless probiotics.

Advisor(1)
Dr. Chong ZHANG received his B.Sc. and Ph.D. in chemical engineering at Department of Chemical Engineering, Tsinghua University in 2002 and 2008, respectively. His current research projects aim at synthetic biology in the field of biochemical engineering including:
(1) Basic principles and methods of synthetic biology for the construction of novel enzymes, microbial cell factories and microbial consortia with new functions for industrial applications;
(2) The application of synthetic biology in the bio-synthesis of chiral chemicals, novel cofactor regeneration systems, bioconversion of methanol to isoprene and bioconversion of low-grade biomass to hydrogen and methane.
Instructors(2)
Weifan LIANG
Hi, I am weifan majored in biochemical engineering and it is my 3rd year in graduate study. As an instructor of the team, I guide them to finish the experiment. And now I am always deeply moved by their persistence and hard working. They have carried out experience overnight many times to accelerate progress and they well finish their division. Hoping for the great result in iGEM.
Tianmin WANG
I'm Tainmin Wang, PhD 2th year student in Tsinghua majored in metabolic engineering. Great for me to be the instructor for this passional team. We are really a team that everyone works for our goal and at the same time enjoys the fun of synthetic biology. We made a fantastic story in this summer and I hope everyone will enjoy it during the Jamboree in Hong Kong or even MIT. We are coming!
Team Members(14)
Hi, I am Yinan WU, the team leader, and I am going to be a senior student majored in chemical engineering. Owing to my experience in the bio chemical laboratory for about one year, I have some knowledge of traditional biological chemical industry. And thanks to iGEM, I know more about synthetic biology. My main work during this summer is to do the experiment. I have a hand in the structure and representation of the parts.
Hi, I am Yijun ZHANG,and I am going to be a senior student majored in life science. I'm familiar with traditional bio experiments, for I spent my junior year in a lab working on cell biology. And as a member of our iGEM team, I know more about synthetic biology. During experiments, I was always surprised by the interesting results. I really enioy the procedure of genetically engineering our E.coli to achieve amazing function. Hope our creation will also amaze you all!
Hi, I am Mingyuan DU majored in chemical engineering and I am going to have my 3rd year in Tsinghua University. I am the main supervisor of our cute little story about the microorganism --- including the play, the characters, the designing and finally the video. After the whole process, I picked up my confidence and was finally able to speak out loud that I am a capable person who enjoys challenges and difficulties.
I'm Zijian GUO and I'm major in Fundamental Science of Chemistry and Biology. Now it's my final year of my bachelor degree. Everything related to biology and chemistry and their interdisciplinary turns me on and I want to be a scientist in the next 10 years. After that, I'm not sure. Maybe running a café? Cooking is just another version of experiment, isn't it? For this IGEM project, I focus more on the parts design and experiment. It is nice to have such a friendly team to work in. And the exploring during the project is as fascinating as you can expect. I hope that our story could catch your attention.
I am Shude LIU from Tsinghua University, institute of chemical engineering. I feel very lucky to be a part of our IGEM team---THU-E, which focuses on the in vivo evolution for microbial cell factory. I used to think that Darwin’s theory of evolution just happen naturally without the interference of human being. But through our project, I realized that the process can actually be accurately designed and controlled by us, providing a promising way to evolve overproduction microbe. And I strongly believe that one day we can make the process of artificial evolution to be continuous, making it more accurate and controllable.
Hi! I’m Tianhui MA, a senior-to-be student majored in chemical engineering while minored in economy. Joining our iGEM team has been one of the most correct choices I have made in college since from here I’ve got the real feeling of being a part of a team and the understanding of the concept of cooperation as well as competition. As a novice, the primary part I am in charge with is the designing and actualizing of our wiki. Sharing ideas with my coworkers is like watching a firework show --- the infinite sparkles of innovations.
I am Beiduo RAO majored in chemical engineering and I am supposed to have my last year in Tsinghua University as an undergraduate students. I applied for this iGEM in an attempt to broaden knowledge of not only theoretical but also practical Biochemistry to which I have a plan to devote in the future. I always enjoy the happy time in the lab doing experiments. It makes me feel proud of myself, especially in terms of operational ability, and figure out a new definition of myself in the harmony of this team.
Hi! I’m Hao SUN and I am going to be a sophomore once more time in the coming new semester. Please hang on a second if you were considering me as a bad student with poor grades. Things became both complicated and simple after I joined our iGEM team. Though majored in ChemE, I am the leader of the programming part. As confused as I’ve got with the larger and larger gap between my status quo --- a student majored in chemical engineering --- and my real talent and interest --- computer and programming, my dream hiding in the bottom of my heart is becoming clearer and clearer and finally up to the surface. I changed my major to computer science and thanks to iGEM, I find me the true self this time.
Hi, I’m Hewei TANG a senior student majored in Chemical Engineering. I enjoy the whole procedure of taking part in this awesome IGEM team and working with my fellow teammates. Taking in charge of Human Practice, I find a brand new perspective to appreciate synthetic biology and what it can do for our life. I hope that synthetic biology can be a widely accepted concept one day and that everybody can know how it will make a difference.
Hi, here is Han WANG, a junior student majored in chemical engineering. Tasks in our iGEM team are strenuous and at the same time challenging and enjoyable. As a sophomore last year, I had not tried doing a research, and was entirely confused with the sophisticated equipments in our lab at first. It is really fascinating to take a comparison between the past me and the person I am now. Though still frustrated with not-so-ideal results, I am skilled with the operation in our lab and surrounded by the passion about the competition and biochemistry much stronger when I decided to join the team.
Hi, I’m Yifan WEI and I am going to be a 3rd year student majored in Biology next semester. To fight in our team is a great glory to me. Maybe I can be called “Main Tank” in our lab work. I am the one who has been working in the lab for the longest time in our team and the one who obtained the most techniques in our team to aid the process of the experiment. I made my progress and was able to control the experiment independently. In the later period, I was even in charge of the characterization of the part “Bitter Pressure” without other teammates’ help.
Hi, here is Zhenlin ZHAO, I am primarily in charge of human practice. Games and Biochemistry are two of my favorite things in, probably, my whole life. In the middle of a discussion with the team, an idea struck me that computer game themed synthesis biology might be a perfect marriage between them and an efficient way to publicize the idea of iGEM. And then there born our iGEM game for human practice. Along the process of making this game, I have found not only so many interesting ideas and astonishing achievements of the iGEM precursors but also my passion in biochemistry.
Hi, I’m Pengji ZHOU and I am in my 3rd year of studying chemical engineering. What fascinate me most is the boundless possibilities existing in genetic engineering and how iGEM make it possible to gather numerous brilliant ideas all over the world. That is the main reason for my initially applying the team. But soon, I have found that our team is much more than that: the cooperation and encouragement is what keeps me and us holding on to our ultimate goal.
Hi, I am Wenming ZHU majored in chemical engineering. I am going to enjoy my 3rd year in Tshinghua University and how lucky I am to get the chance of being a team member in iGEM! Just like how I devote my passion into sports, I love the feel of challenge and achievement along the process of preparing for the final competition. No matter the experiments, the designing of our loge and T-shirts or solving technical problem concerning our wiki, I am willing and capable to nail them as long as my passion do not extinguish. Thanks to iGEM, never did I have the strong and real feeling of being alive as youth!

HIT IGEM
The HIT-Harbin team is comprised of 21 motivated students across a wide range of academic backgrounds this year: from freshman to senior, from biology to electromechanics. our common dream makes us together, leads us to realize the passion for science, gives us energy to stay up late in the lab. We have been taking great efforts to make our dream come true and enjoying the happiness and sadness in the process.
We have experienced a nice summer this year. Tears and sweats mingled. Staying up late and sleeping in the lab is an unforgettable experience for me, though our device do not work as what our model predicts. I would not forget the day we successfully linked two standard biological parts together for the first time, the feeling when we failed to see our E.coli culture becoming red, and the help from our teachers and other team members... Given more time, we would go further.--zeng

We have thought of this project by ourselves, so it was not an assignment from one of our supervisors. The supervisors and advisers only had influence on the team as a consultant.
Brain storming and discussing
All the students had read lots of literature and taken part in the brain storms offering new ideas. The brain storms began in March 2013. and last for a long time. What's more, we have meetings on Sundyas to discuss our project and share achievements with each other.
Experiments
The experiments were leading by Xiangmiao Zeng, Xingchen Zhai, Yifan Wu and Kang Yang. Besides, the sophomores often comes to give a hand and learn some basic skills of experiments as well.
Modeling
Modeling was done by Xiangmiao Zeng and Yifan Wu. They learnt a lot themselves and Pro. Xu trained them sometimes. Finally, thanks for MATLAB.
Designer
The logo was designed by Ying Zhang and Kunming Zhao. T-shirt, poster, postcard, brochure for our sponsors and our human practice, were made by Yifan Wu and Pro. Xu. Yujing Ouyang and Ye Hua designed our PPT background. And thanks for the help and advice provided by the other students.
Wiki
All of us joined the process of making wiki this summer, with the coding work by Hongfei Zhang. Yujing Ouyang and Lecheng Ruan translate our work into English. Gathering materials, designing our own style and making it, everyone is enjoying it.

Our Team
Our team consists of five enthusiastic undergraduate students, who manifest genuine interest in the sphere of Synthetic Biology. We became familiar with IGEM competition in summer 2012 and asked our faculty to organize special Synthetic Biology course in order to learn more about this exciting sphere of biology. Fortunately, our professors also became interested in this competition and were glad to organize two wonderful courses of Synthetic Biology. These courses gave us a great background in many different topics, but the most interesting topic for us was the application of aptamers in diagnosis, treatment and research. Then, in April 2013 we asked Dr. Damira, our mentor, who has been working with aptamers in our University research center, to join her team in lab.

Brief History of NYMU ( http://www.ym.edu.tw/ )
Founded in 1974, National Yang-Ming University, formerly known as National Yang-Ming College of Medicine, has been adhering to the school motto of ""benevolent mind and art, putting knowledge into practice"" while training excellent humane doctors to provide service by solving medical problems in remote and rural areas.
Graduated in 1982, the first government-sponsored class of the Faculty of Medicine was sent to public clinics and hospitals. Since then, our graduates have penetrated all corners of Taiwan and became pioneers in basic healthcare services. As our graduates won warm acclaim from society, we found that we had successfully accomplished our initial mission.
In order to cultivate a new generation of professional medical talents, we began to expand our disciplines into biomedicine. In 1994, we were promoted to ""National Yang-Ming University"" and became the first medicine-oriented comprehensive university in Taiwan. As time went on, we established the School of Medical Technology and Engineering, the School of Life Sciences, the Center for General Studies, and the School of Nursing. Finally, we were permitted to establish a School of Dentistry in 2000 and also became a research university focusing on medicine and biotechnology.
We have been endeavoring to develop academic research since our establishment. Based on our school motto: ""benevolent mind and art, putting knowledge into practice,"" we expect ourselves to both pursue academic excellence and be concerned for humanity. Thus, we have been enthusiastic at pursuing new knowledge, and apply it to teaching and research; this has led to the establishment of an extraordinary culture and an excellent tradition in academic research.
In the area of teaching, we aim to develop our students' self-learning and independent thinking skills in accordance with our explicit educational philosophy of attempting to cultivate leaders with a sound fundamental knowledge, strong humanistic concerns and critical thinking ability. In the past 30 years, we have trained many excellent doctors who have worked in remote areas and contributed significantly to the development of society; on the other hand, we have also trained excellent biomedical researchers who make very important contributions to the future of the country. Many of the active leaders in the field of biomedical science are our alumni.
In the area of research, we have been awarded the Program for Promoting Academic Excellence of Universities for results in our top two research fields of Genetics and Brain Research. Additionally, with respect to interdisciplinary research, we have participated in the Megabase Human Genome Sequencing, constructed the BAC contig map of human chromosome 4 and sequenced the chimp's chromosome 22. Thanks to our outstanding accomplishments, we have recently been accredited as a research university by the Ministry of Education. Moreover, according to Academia Sinica 2005, we are ranked top in both the quality and quantity of research publications, as well as average faculty productivity among all universities in Taiwan. The report of Chiao Tung University, Shanghai, published in the same year, gave the same result.
Our success is no coincidence but an attribute of excellent allocation of limited resources and the devoted efforts of both the faculty and students, all of which were needed to achieve ""brilliant results in teaching and research"" within such a short period of time. Due to our research atmosphere, academic accomplishments, innovative knowledge and cultivation of talent, we have well demonstrated our standing as a top university.
In the future, we will continue to make good use of our accumulated capacity in teaching and research to educate and train future experts and leaders in the discipline of biomedicine. We will further develop the field of biomedicine that has won international attention and thus begin about a new era in education and research at the top international level.

During this summer we collaborated with other iGEM teams:
1. We sent a soil sample to the NRP-UEA-Norwich team .
2. We participated to the ""Bricks of Knowledge"" project of the Copenhagen team : Our video , Copenhague explicative video
3. We met with the Evry team to discuss our respective projects. We met the Evry's team during an afternoon in August. During this meeting, we presented the various aspects of our respective projects : the scientific part, the human practice part and the modeling part. After each presentation we debated, asked questions, and proposed solutions to improve the other team's project. At the end of the day we  had a big 4 o'clock tea.

We would like to acknowledge our advisors who have assisted us throughout the project. We would also like to thank everyone else who have helped us throughout the project, such as helping us organise the SynPhilo conference and SynArt exhibition. Their helps have been invaluable and have made enormous changes during the project durations. We would also like to state that all work and data presented on this wiki was undergone by us unless stated otherwise.
Abdulkerim Ayparçası
I am a student at turgut ozal university and have some experience doing research. I discovered that new approaches in medicine can be taken using the principles of synthetic biology. Such approaches are evident in our iGEM project,as we have tried to address an age old medical problem in an innovative yet resonable way. My interests are related to the use of alternative treatments to diseases.During my free-time I like reading, cooking,  swimming and playing tennis.
Nur Nihal Baltaci
Hey my name is Nur Nihal Baltaci, I currently am studying the second year of medicine in Turgut Ozal University. I call bacteria and proteins my children since we have grown very fond of each other within the past 3-4 months. Synthetic Biology and its infinite possibilities just simply intrigues me. Every morning I wake up with an increasing lust to learn more and experiment.
Aysenur Toygar
My name is Aysenur Toygar and as you can suspect I am one of the second year medical students too! My team mates call me the coincubation girl. I feel special for being a part of this team as well as the iGEM community. Working on a project in iGEM has been a powerful food to fill my hunger of knowledge on researching and experimenting.
Taha Akcay
Hi my name is Taha Akcay and I’m no different to any of my team mates in terms of medicine. I can proudly say that I am a pro in transforming bacteria as it has been one of my most abundant occupancies besides doing experiments such as immunoflorescence colouring.
Safa Tapan
Hi I’m called Safa Tapan and am a second year medical student. Synthetic Biology fascinates me and constantly arises questions which remain in my head to be answered. For this reason, each day in iGEM has enabled me to go on a journey of searching for answers. I enjoy working in the laboratory and doing western blot. IGEM has been the right choice for me as I often can’t keep myself seated for long!
Fatih Karabacak
My name is Fatih Karabacak and I am from Konya. Just like non other I am medical student too! But guess which year? Of course two!. I feel privileged to be a part of this team and have had great time in the lab doing experiments such as SDS-PAGE.
Fethi Onal
Hi, I am Fethi Onal. This is my second year in Turgut Ozal University of medicine. As a medical student I am very excited for participating in the iGEM competition. Despite it being tiring, I really enjoyed working in the lab during the summer and doing experiments.
Furkan Bestepe
Hi! I’m Furkan. My friends and my professors call me Furkeinstein. I’m youngest member of my team. This iGEM 2013 is my first iGEM but I attended iGEM HS twice as a student before. I’m a freshmen medical school student and finally my slogan from Nikola Tesla is “Our virtues and flaws cannot be separated just like power and matter. If they are separated human is nothing.”
Mustafa Semih Elitok
Hello! I’m Mustafa. My purpose of being a member of ATOMS Turkiye team is be with my dear friends. I am a 4th year medicine student and I’m oldest and most experienced members of this team. I enjoy finding connections between medical processes and social life. Finally I want to say that if you try to look more deeply, you can recognize some metaphor in life.
Omer Bilgic
Hi, my name is Omer. I am a second year medicine student who really likes listening to piano melodies that make me relax. I often use some words or idioms that’s from my own town Konya. These words have eventually become popular around my friends. So I want to finish this text with  ‘iGEM Cok Hos La!” that means ‘iGEM is amazing’.
Busra Nur Aydin
Hi I am Busra. I am 3rd year medicine student who really enjoys to photoshop and designing. I have designed the posters and logos present on our iGEM wiki. My friends think I am very talented in Photoshop. If I am good at designing, my secret is “Be basic be elegant”.
Mikail Dogan
Hello! My name is Mikail. I am 2nd year student in med school. It is a fact that a student that study in field of science have to think analytically because of the lessons. But I believe that that turns a human to robot. So a person sometimes just look around maybe the nature and should see creature’s beauty. I think that makes us human.
Esin Demir
Hi, I’m Esin. I am the advisor of this team and I am Master student in Medical Genetic Department. I know I am the head of this team but I saw my team members as friend. Because I believe be close and sincere to your team members is best way to organize people and to be a team.
Advisors:
Esra Gunduz
Hello everyone! My name is Esra. I’m an Associate Professor of Medical Genetics. This is my fifth year back in Turkey after staying twelve years in Japan. I mainly work on Cancer Genetics and more specifically on Tumor Suppressor Genes. I enjoy being with my students and working with them together. iGEM competition has provided us to become closer. I think we share a lot scientifically, socially and friendly together with my students. I also like speaking Japanese and cooking
Mehmet Gunduz
Hello everyone. My name is Mehmet Gunduz. I’m an otolaryngologist and a medical geneticist. I can’t give up any of my subjects because I like them all; both working as a surgeon, clinician and researcher. My hobby is working hard. I like to use the every second of life and I say ‘never give up’.
Omer Faruk Hatipoglu

University of Michigan, USA
The Recombinase Team ! When we decided to use recombinase systems at the beginning of our project, we found that an iGEM team in the US ( Michigan University ) had worked last year on FimE, a specific recombination system. We established contact with them in order to get some relevant information about the recombinases and understand better how they worked. After several mail exchanges we planned a videoconference between our teams to discuss about our project and the different biobricks that could have been interesting for us or them. We received their improved fimE system from last year with the IRR and IRL sequences. In counterpart we send them our riboregulation system, but unfortunately it was too late for us to use it in their system.
University of East Anglia, United Kingdom
In order to help the iGEM Norwich team (to make a new biosensor that can detect new antibiotics), we collected soil samples from the famous ""Canal du Midi"". We hope that it served them in their great project!
Also thank you to all the other teams who helped us:

Project idea
The project idea - the detection and quantification of progestins in water samples - was drafted by the team members themselves last year. This year's team continued last year's work.
System design
The overall system design was drafted in close cooperation with the team's instructors. All primer design was performed toghether with Dr. Kristian Apel (student team members were present at all times during design sessions).
Lab supplies
All media (LB, SOB, YPD, SC), most buffers (TAE) and all competent cells were prepared by the team-members themselves following protocols that were provided by Professor Jansen's team without any additional help. Reagents like carrier-DNA (salmon sperm DNA) and ONE-STEP buffer for yeast transformations and antibiotics were provided ready-made by Professor Jansen's team.
Lab and lab hardware
Most experiments were carried out at the team's laboratory at the IFIB (Interfakultäres Institut für Biochemie) in Tübingen. The team's laboratory was kindly provided by Professor Ralf-Peter Jansen. Due to lacking hardware at the team's laboratory, some team members have carried out select experiments at University of Tübingen's ZMBP (Zentrum für Molekularbiologie der Pflanzen) or at the microbiological institute. All team members were introduced to the handling of complex instruments by the team's instructors or (when necessary) by the host lab's workers. After this introduction all lab hardware was operated solely by team members.
DNA-sequencing
All DNA-sequencing was performed by an external provider ( Eurofins ). In most cases sequencing results were evaluated by the team members alone. Sometimes results were discussed with the team's instructors. In some cases, the secquencing primers were created in collaboration with the instructors.
Lab work
All lab work was conducted by the team members themselves. Neither the team's instructors nor host lab workers have performed one single experiment. External influence on lab work was restricted to advice.
Wiki

Acknowledgements
Presenting Eugenie to Wellesley community.
We would like to thank The National Science Foundation , Agilent Technologies , Wellesley College , and The Howard Hughes Medical Institute for generously making our research this summer possible. We would also like to thank Cathy Summa for all her support, Natalie Kuldell for her teachings and advice, as well as, Rebekah for her time and advisement.
Attributions and Contributions
Eugenie
The application was designed by Tiffany Chen, Casey Grote, Catherine Guo, Evan Segreto, and Sravanti Tekumalla with input from Consuelo Valdes, Diana Eastman, and our advisor; Orit Shaer. Members of the BU iGem team and their advisor, Traci Haddock, provided input and advice during the design process. Ernst Oberortner provided an introduction to Eugene and advice.
zTree
zTree was designed by Cassie Hoef and Daniel Worstell and was inspired by a photo representation of tree structured data from the Palo Alto Research Center. They were advised by Orit Shaer, Consuelo Valdes, and Robert Kincaid. Daniel imported the data sheets from the Registry of Standard Biological Parts and Cassie designed much of the front end functionality, as well as the file IO. They were assisted by Yoav Segev, an intern.
Bac to the Future
Bac to the Future was primarily inspired by an experiment conducted by the Church Lab at Harvard Medical School, which used bacteria DNA to store encoded book citations. In addition, we drew inspiration from our participatory design session with the BU iGEM team , Robert Kincaid, and our lab experience with Professor Natalie Kuldell from MIT. The application was designed by Joanna Bi and Heather Petrow with input from Diana Eastman, Consuelo Valdes, and our advisor; Orit Shaer, and was implemented by Joanna Bi and Heather Petrow, with the help of Diana Eastman. Additionally, we were aided by interns: Neoreet Braha and Artemis Metaxas.
The iGEM Team Wiki
The iGEM Team Wiki was designed by Casey Grote and implemented by Diana Eastman and the team.

James Bergfield
James is studying for a double major in biochemistry and chemistry and before starting a medical degree next year. In the meantime he's planning to genetically engineer a lizard to be big enough to ride.
Hugh Ford
Grew up on the northern beaches of Sydney where I went to Freshwater senior campus. I went to Sydney University to major in applied maths and biochemistry, and I wanna get amongst the field of mathematical biology. I’m enrolled to do my masters of applied mathematics (hopefully doing my thesis in mathematical biology) at the University of Melbourne.
Desmond Li
Desmond is currently studying for a double major in Chemistry and Biochemistry with prospects of continuing on to do honours and a PhD in Molecular Biology. He has spent over a year working in research laboratories and is hoping to achieve a career as a researcher. One of his many dreams is to travel the world experiencing the sights and culture of various countries.
Vivian Li
Vivian is a purple-coated megababewitch, cybersurfing biohacking and latenightsnacking for the thrill of it. Plus I'm pretty sure she owns cowboy boots.
Robert Oppenheimer
Robbie wants to build the greenhouse we’ll need on Mars. Failing that he’ll return to the family sheep-farm, but that also seems pretty challenging, so he’s also considering ethnographic research about how Balinese shadow-puppeteers understand the concept of a gene. He can talk cash out of a money-tree and bluff his way into a molecular biology lab. He’s only seen it once, but he really digs the film ‘Frances Ha’, check it out.
Shuravi Paul
I am currently studying B. Science, majoring in Microbiology at USYD. I hope to become a researcher in medical microbiology. iGEM has made university that extra bit more interesting. Recently, I discovered how exciting and rewarding bengali/bollywood dancing is. I also love food (that is perhaps an understatement!) and trying out new recipes.
Cyril Tang
Aspiring Supreme Ruler of the World, and Conqueror of the Universe, he spends his quiet days at University fooling everybody into thinking he is just like any other student at Sydney University studying Science and Medicine.
Otherwise, he enjoys Scandinavia (especially Icelandic) and juggling in his spare time.
Andrew Tuckwell
Andrew has been avoiding iGEM for years but has finally caved in. He hopes for a world where every mundane detail of life is in fact alive. A magical-garden world where biology is the grand empress and everyone knows it. If you know any sick steam-punk-ribo-funk-bio-sci-fi, let him know! He dreams of aseptically jumping through flaming loops and accidentally (on purpose) made LB-agar plates with agarose.   Quote of the Year – ‘Agar and agarose: they’re just like Nic and Nicholas, right?’
Nick Coleman
Five minutes after hearing about iGEM for the first time, Nick gave a ‘provisional yes’ and became our team supervisor. He’s into bioremediation and mobile genetic elements. He’s great to visit if you have bad dreams about the secondary structure of palindromic sequences. Rumour has it he used to play in a rock-band and now plays Magic the Gathering (it’s a card game for nerds, you graduate to this after Dungeons and Dragons). He also has a samurai sword and is a Safety Officer for the building.   Quote of the Year - ‘We should also do replicates, as I believe these are quite popular with scientists’.

Ethel Roosevelt
Ethel Carow Roosevelt Derby (August 13, 1891 – December 10, 1977) was the youngest daughter and fourth child of the President of the United States Theodore Roosevelt. Known as The Queen of Oyster Bay and The First Lady of Oyster Bay by its Long Island residents, Ethel was instrumental in preserving both the legacy of her father as well as the family home, ""Sagamore Hill"" for future generations, especially after the death of her mother Edith in 1948.

This project was the independent idea of the team members and not integrated into a specific lab's research projects. Expertise, equipment and financial support was gathered from a wide range of sources.
Kathy Bates conducted many of the laboratory preparation and experiments including the phage construction and characterization. Kathy also did the programming in Solidworks and the 3D modeling and printing and coordinated some of the outreach presentations.
Ben Beltzer developed an agent-based host-phage dynamics model in netlogo. He helped the team with some of the lab procedures and is currently developing an educational, viral infection-based game.
Andrew Nadig helped develop and implement the model of KillerRed synthesis and superoxide production and helped with photobleaching experiments and other wet work. He participated in the development and delivery of outreach presentations at the University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh Science and Technology Academy, and Taylor Allderdice High School in addition to building The Laser Game and writing corny poetic parodies for the wiki.
Eric Pederson worked in developing the lambda (λ) phage, performed the cloning experiments to produce the plasmids that were used for characterization and performed the phototoxicity experiments. Eric also performed the cloning required for the BioBrick submissions. He organized and analyzed the data and helped characterize KillerRed as a photosensitizer and mRFP1 as a negative control. He participated in the outreach presentations at the University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh Science and Technology Academy and Taylor Allderdice High school.
Evan Starkweather assisted with solution preparation and other lab work when needed. He also designed the graphics for the wiki and the team t-shirts.
Dr. Marcel Bruchez was the faculty advisor for the team and secured lab and meeting space and provided technical advice on fluorescence, ROS and instrumentation as well as strategic advice.
Dr. Natasa Miskov-Zivanov led the formation of the CMU iGEM 2013 team and the fundraising for the team. She provided guidance and advice for the modeling part of the project.
Dr. Cheryl Telmer: The laboratory experiments were discussed daily with Dr. Telmer, who provided training and guidance on all laboratory techniques as needed.
Dr. Cheemeng Tan served as an advisor for the design of the project. With an expertise in synthetic biology and iGEM experience, Dr. Tan played an important role before he moved to the University of California, Davis.
Dr. Jonathan Jarvik’s lab conducts experiments involving lambda phage. Dr. Jarvik is a professor for the PhageHunters course at CMU and he offered his expertise and also supplies.
Dr. Tim Jarvela was a graduate student in Adam Linsteadt’s lab (just defended!!) who used KillerRed to inactivate Golgi proteins and he offered advice and did some imaging for the team.
Saumya Saurabh is a graduate student in the Bruchez lab who helped to set up the photobleaching apparatus.
Dr. Justin Hogg was a graduate student (just defended!!) in Computational and Systems Biology at University of Pittsburgh who provided advice to the modeling team on population and agent-based modeling and BioNetGen.

University of Southern Denmark (SDU)
The work was carried out in the Microbiology laboratory at the department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology at the University of Southern Denmark in the city of Odense.Odense University was established in 1966. In 1998, it merged with two other institutes of southern Denmark and became SDU. It has locations in multiple cities all over Denmark including Odense, Kolding, Esbjerg, Sønderborg, Slagelse, and Copenhagen with a shared focus on education and research. There are approximately 3.200 employees and more than 20.000 students enrolled; about half live and study in the city of Odense. Source http://www.sdu.dk/en/Om_SDU
Odense
Odense is quite an extraordinary city. Even though it’s the 3rd largest city of Denmark, Odense only has 2 buildings taller than the 4th floor. The city name originates from “Odins Vi”, meaning a shrine for the worshiping of Odin, the allfather of all gods from the Nordic mythology.
Located on the isle of Funen, placed almost perfectly in the middle of Denmark and with it’s direct connection to the ocean through a cove, Odense was a rich city of trade. A number of Danish kings lived in the city, Knud the Holy was even killed on the altar of the Albani cathedral during a tax-induced revolt. However, any historical figure pales in comparison to the famous author and storyteller Hans Christian Andersen, the most cherished son of Odense.
Today, Odense is a city of knowledge. A fact that is hard to dispute with the University of Southern Denmark and Odense University Hospital being the two largest workplaces in the city.

The Team
The Launch
Location: University of York
Date: January 2013
Initiators: Andra Necula and Alexandro Rizzo
Population: 60 in the first meeting, 40 in the first brainstorming session, 20 to begin dry lab work in April, 14 to survive to carry on in the lab.
The Idea
Let’s construct an improved Microbial Fuel Cell (MFC), powered by engineered E.Coli, which also converts harmful gold ions to shiny (yet tiny) gold nanoparticles!
Godparents: Evaldas Klumbys and Kobchai Duangrarranalert
Reason: Our MFC would provide a solution to growing sustainable energy needs, extract gold nanoparticles from pharmaceutical waste
Our team
When did we start?
The iGEM Team formed at the University of York started in January 2013.
Were we popular?
An introductory lecture to the concept of the competition was given by enthusiastic students and later team members – Andra Necula and Alexandro Rizzo.
60! Over 60 students showed up for the first iGEM presentation, after the competition had been advertised widely.
40! From these, about 40 came to the initial brainstorming meeting. Soon after, a couple of workshops were organised. During those workshops there was a further briefing on the details surrounding iGEM. However, the two main points of those were the brainstorming of project ideas and the subscription of new ‘recruits’ for the emerging York team.
20! After choosing two ideas from a list of over 100, about 20 enthusiastic students decided to carry on with the project.
The godparents of our idea
During one of those early sessions the idea of a Microbial Fuel Cell was mentioned by final year students Evaldas Klumbys and Kobchai Duangrattanalert. Being a complex idea, it initially did not receive as much attention as other more “exciting” ideas like ‘Organic Lemon Grenades’ for example. One other idea– Bacterial Mouthwash– was taken up seriously by several future iGEMers and the forming team was split into two subunits for the first time and a competition of sorts was organised between the ideas. Eventually, the broad application of MFCs and the rather invasive character of Bacterial Mouthwash tilted the scales towards the former.
Who takes care of us?
University of York lecturers Dr. James Chong, Dr. Gavin Thomas and Prof. Maggie Smith were established as team supervisors. Our team benefited a lot from the help of other academics as well, namely Dr. James Edwards.
The joy of reading
It was now April - the long and grueling process of dry lab work and project design had begun! Team members had to read dozens of papers to get up to the level needed for such a complicated concept. We had regular briefing workshops where we would let our supervisors know how much progress we had made. Sponsorship requests were also sent during this time and an article in NOUSE, the University newspaper and website, was released with the aim of intriguing the potential iGEMers of next year.
The Survivors
Fourteen of us carried on to form the first iGEM team ever at the University of York. We are a good mix of biologists and biochemists, spanning from 1st to 4th year of studies, coming from:
Team members from green countries:
Bulgaria: Nikola, Ivan
Latvia: Rudolfs
Lithuania: Jonas, Gintare, Evaldas
Romania: Andra
Spain: Ricardo, Alexandro
Thailand: Kobchai
United Kingdom: Andrew, Hannah, Caroline, Rebecca
Our Superheroes:
China: Oswin - wiki design
Italy: Bruna - logo design and comics
Lithuania: Mantas, Paulius - wiki coding
Biographies
Supervisors
Dr. James Chong the Lead Supervisor
Dr Chong became our main supervisor this year, just after he returned from a 3 months trip to... Antarctica! During his time on Signy Island, he investigated microbial consumption of climate gases, hoping to understand more on how climate change affects this region of our planet. However, when he is not out in the cold, he likes to conduct research on mechanisms of DNA replication, using methanogenic archaea. He has been in York for 10 years now and, a big fan of iGEM, he was thrilled to bring the competition to the University.
Supervisor Prof. Maggie Smith
Prof Smith came to York last year and, luckily for us, she was keen on getting involved in the life of the Department by joining iGEM! After nine years at the University of Aberdeen, she chose to continue here her research on phages here. Her main interest lies in the adaptations phages go through, when infecting their host, the antibiotic-producing bacteria Streptomyces.
Supervisor Dr. Gavin Thomas
Dr Thomas is a big fan of Escherichia coli, so we were very happy to have him in our team. His research focuses on transport of molecules accross bacterial membranes (for instance, sialic acid), in the hope of understanding the mechanisms used by bacteria for metabolisation or for evading the host immune system. He is also interested in the symbiotic relationships between bacteria and insect hosts. After more than 10 years at York, he was happy to see the competition coming to town.
Supervisor Dr. James Edwards
Dr Edwards was part of our department since his PhD years! This summer, after more than 10 years in York, he decided to move on to University of Plymouth, where he will be a lecturer in Biomedical Sciences. During his time at York, he investigated the mechanisms of respiration of the human pathogen meningococcus.  We were grateful that, before leaving, he found the time to help our team move the project forward!
Advisor Alexandro Rizzo
My name is Alexandro Rizzo and I am a second year biochemist student at York University. I am one of the founder members of this iGEM team, the first of our university, and I did it because I want to get hands on experience with synthetic biology which I think is gonna be a crucial technology in the near future. I am a mature student, which means I am a little bit old, because I did a lot of other stuff before coming to Uni, like import cars from Germany to Spain, work as a lifeguard, write, travel around the world, volunteer in the third world or set up an organic gardening company back home. But now here I am. I love practicing sports, the beach, movies and literature and spend time with my friends.
Team Members
Andra Stefania Necula
Having completed my Molecular Biology course at York this year, I am now about to start a PhD in Immunology at Oxford. I love being involved in educational projects and I am passionate about entrepreneurship, but at the end of the day it's Biology that makes my heart tick.
Evaldas Klumbys
3rd year biochemist. I am detonated by the power of symphonic metal, activated by the intensity of football, charmed by the grace of ice skating, calmed by the soothing voice of my singing guitar and most importantly fascinated by the beauty of sciences all together. Without them, my life would be meaningless. P.S. I am not insane my mother had me tested (by Dr. Sheldon Cooper).
Kobchai Duangrattanalert
Hello earthlings!!! I am he who knows no rest. I'm surrounded by sarcasm, though it hardly touches onto my head. But BE WARNED, don't lay a finger on me or else I shall be thou DOOM BRINGER ... you mortals. *troll face*
Nikola Panayotov
My name is Nikola. I’m a first year Biochemist originally from Bulgaria studying at the University of York. This is my first year in iGEM. I am interested in exploring the vast opportunities offered by Synthetic Biology. I believe that it will definitely be one of the most important scientific areas in the future. I’m also quite interested in Physics and would like to learn more about it. Throughout this year I have been involved both in the wet and the dry lab work – modelling, designing the wiki, making videos and funding. Apart from that I enjoy going out with friends, watching movies and playing volleyball. I am available on nik_panayotov@yahoo.com
Andrew Farthing
I am a first year Biochemistry student originally from Manchester participating in the iGEM competition this year. The wide range of experience the project offers is staggering, from sponsorship to video production to lab work to outreach. I am truly grateful to have the opportunity to work with such an intelligent and diverse group of people. Within the competition I am specifically involved in sponsorship, modelling, outreach and quorum sensing, as well as general lab work. Outside of the lab I enjoy hiking, cycling, camping. I have been a member of the scouts from a young age and have completed my Gold DofE and Queen's Scout award. I also pride myself on having walked Coast to Coast for charity last year.
Jonas Kondratavičius
I came from Lithuania to study BSc in Molecular Biology in York last year. I like it in here and I love the birds around the campus although sometimes I feel unexplainable void within myself as there are no pink pelicans in here. My part in the team was cloning, if you have any queries or need some help, contact me at jk798@york.ac.uk.
Ivan Gyulev
My name is Ivan and I just finished my Second Year of studying Genetics at York. I represent Bulgaria, Plovdiv and Language School “Plovdiv” along with my good friend Nik whose biography you can find somewhere lying around. My interests in Biology are varied and numerous. Participating in iGEM and acquiring knowledge in Synthetic Biology has given me yet another perspective on the magnificent science that is the study of life. Among other topics, I am also interested in Evolutionary Developmental Biology. In the future, I wish to explore the intersections of those two disciplines and many more. My interests and hobbies outside the lab include sports like cycling, rowing and weightlifting, and the trademark activity of my hometown – just relaxing.
Ricardo Cañavate del Pino
My name is Ricardo and I am currently studying Biochemistry at the University of York. I am originally from Spain and I am keen on fashion, marketing and botanics. I would like to lead my career into lab research (epidemics, virology and mycorrhiza are my favourite topics at the moment). Feel free to contact me at rcdp501@york.ac.uk
Gintarė Bučaitė
100% Lithuanian. And if that’s isn’t enough, a girl. Reported to have a lot of ideas, yet not enough time to bring them to life. If she fails to become a scientist, she’ll buy a Mad Cat Lady starter kit with 20 kittens and enjoy the life as it is. Before that, Gintare has plans to do something crazy, something breath-taking and something useful. By the way, Biochemistry, currently second year. iGEM duties: Jonas’ lab buddy. Also, had food. Contact: gb706@york.ac.uk
Rebecca Miles
I am just going into my second year studying biology, and would like to go on to do research in developmental biology. I’ve been learning a lot from iGEM; how to work aseptically, how to keep a lab book, and generally how to be more confident in the lab. A lot of the biological concepts which seemed daunting at first now make perfect sense, and I’m sure they will come in handy later in my degree. When not in the lab I can generally be found doing LARP (Live Action Role Play), a hobby in which I and other LARPers dress up in armour and hit each other with foam weapons. It is at least as cool as it sounds. My email address is rcpm501@york.ac.uk
Extended Team
Hannah Johnson
I’m a second year Biochemist all the way from exotic Gloucestershire, born in the saddle I love horses, and am a keen polo player for the University team. I’ve been mostly involved in the article writing for iGEM and some of the brainstorming. The experience has been enriching and inspiring, working with such a dedicated group of Synthetic Biology enthusiasts.
Rudolfs Petrovs
I am a second year Biochemist. In a search for a better education in a more suitable for me direction I came from Latvia to University of York. I am interested in Natural Sciences, Maths and Computer science but my main scientific interest is in process of ageing. I find iGEM idea fascinating and useful for advancing science and biotechnology in paricular
Caroline Pearson
My name is Caroline and I am currently studying biology at York. I am doing a year in industry this year which is great! My aim is to get as much experience out of my time at University as possible. That is why I was so excited to be involved in iGEM it was great fun to be involved in all the brainstorming sessions and discussing all the ideas which finally became refined into the fantastic idea that we went ahead with.
The University of York
York
Fantastic location, medieval city walls and town itself, lots of birds (maybe too many), friendly people, real Hogwarts express – could you ask for anything more awesome?
York is a city with a rich heritage, having been founded over two millennia ago. It was in turn a Roman, Viking and Norman city. The buildings in the city centre still preserve the beautiful Victorian style, particularly on Shambles, which has been chosen the most beautiful street in the world. York also holds the record for the most haunted place on Earth! The National Railway Museum contains a wide collection of trains, including the locomotive of Harry Potter’s Hogwarts Express.
University
1st in the UK and 7th in the world in the Times Higher Education world rankings of universities less than 50 years old.
2nd for Biosciences in the Guardian University Guide 2014 In general, cool place to study (York students’ approved)
Biology Department
Home for York iGEM 2013 team. State-of-art labs, cutting edge technologies, friendly and approachable lecturers – not boasting, just stating the facts.
Anniversaries
Being established in 1963, the uni celebrates its 50th anniversary this year, a great moment for participating in iGEM for the first time.

This summer, we faced numerous hurdles in our research and would not have been able to handle them without the generous assistance of many individuals and organizations. These contributors were essential to our progress and provided valuable aid in the form of insightful guidance (answers to ""quick questions""), useful materials, and/or necessary financial assistance.
We would like to thank Dr. Santiago Di Pietro (Assistant Professor, Department of Biochemistry, CSU) for his sharing some of his vast knowledge of molecular mechanisms of protein transport, for allowing the team access to yeast strains from his yeast-GFP collection, and for assisting in imaging yeast cells with Fluorescence Microscopy
We thank Dr. Mauricio Antunes (Special Assistant Professor, Department of Biology, CSU) for his insightful advice, time, and energy spent helping us this summer.
We thank Dr. Laurie Stargell (Professor, Department of Biochemistry, CSU) and several members of her lab for providing access to several strains from their yeast-knockout collection.
Finally, we encourage you to visit our Sponsors page, as without the financial or material help from those listed there, we would not be here now.

Lindsey
A student pursuing a Bachelor's of Science in Chemical and Biological Engineering, Lindsey was really excited to be a part of CSU's 2013 iGEM team. This is the first opportunity she has had to be a part of a collaborative engineering group effort outside of the classroom, and she learned a lot about the R&D side of the scientific field. She really enjoyed formulating the various project ideas and planning the execution of them. She took a special interest in the desalination project, and looks forward to continuing to work on it over the next couple of years. Outside of the academic realm, Lindsey loves to spend time in the Colorado outdoors and loves animals, and plans to eventually own and operate and non-profit, no-kill animal shelter in the Colorado foothills.
Adriana
Adriana is in her second year at Colorado State University working to achieve her Bachelor's degree in Microbiology. She plans to either become a research scientist or attend Medical School to become a pathologist. iGEM is important to her because she has always had an interest in the subject since she first learned about it in High School. Her favorite part about iGEM is being able to learn new scientific methods as they relate to synthetic biology because most of the work she does in her lab is not synthetic biology. Her favorite project of the summer was the bike tire because she enjoyed being able to design something that was so unique. Adriana also works as a student in Karen Dobos's Tuberculosis Research Lab on campus.
Ryan
Ryan is a senior Biochemistry major at Colorado State University, with minors in Molecular Biology and Chemistry. Aside from iGEM, he currently works in the lab of Karolin Luger in the Department of Biochemistry and aspires to continue his studies and research by pursuing a PhD after graduating from CSU. When he isn’t working or studying, Ryan is an avid ultimate frisbee player, plays piano and guitar, has recently made a beer pilgrimage to Belgium, and enjoys getting outside to enjoy beautiful Colorado’s biking, running, snowshoeing, cross country skiing, and hiking scenes. Go Broncos.
Guy
He claims he's just a regular guy, but we don't believe him. Guy is the embodiment of natural biology and you can expect to see him on the cover of Home Brewer magazine any day now.
Colin
Career Plans - After getting his biochemistry degree he plans on going into research in industry. Hopefully.
Why iGEM? - He needed cash for the summer and also synthetic biology research seemed like a pretty cool gig.
What are your other interests? - Hiking/camping, electronics, and the making and consuming of beer.
How did you hear about the club? - Guy Stewart posted fliers around campus about seeking members for CSU iGEM and he went to the meeting.
Favorite Part - Designing the projects and thinking about how to get our ideas to work.
Learning Experience - He learned that he don't know how to do Gibson Assemblies. He also learned how to use fluorescence microscopy to see the GFP tagged proteins in yeast.
Favorite Beer/Movie - Rail Yard Ale (Wynkoop) and The Blues Brothers.
Andrew
Andrew received his bachelors from CSU in psychology in 2012, but had a change of heart after shadowing a brain surgery in Denver that summer. This spawned his interest in medicine and biology, which led to courses involved in synthetic biology. While working with Dr. Thorsten in the Human Performance Lab on campus, a colleague invited him to a club meeting he attending later that day, the CSU iGEM club. It was there that he heard of the competition and a possible opening for a team member position. Despite ridiculous odds, little to no background knowledge, and no real connection to the club, he applied. He was shocked to be offered the position a few weeks later.
Andrew plans on attending graduate school in a biomedical concentration, and attending medical school in the near future. His hobbies include hockey, guitar, snowboarding, and enjoying the amazing Colorado outdoors with his dog. Oh, and drinking beer, especially Guy’s delicious gluten free beer.
Favorite Beer: New Belgium’s TransAtlantic.
Favorite Movie: Fight Club

Meet the team
This is the third year a team from the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU) is participating in the iGEM competition. Our team consists of five students with background in Biotechnology, Molecular Medicine and Medical Technology. Mostly our collective background is in molecular biology colored with biophysics,  immunology and biotechnology. We have four advisors with different specialities! Rahmi is our lab-GOD and  has all the answers, Eivind gives us money and inspiration, Martin is our GFP-expert and Gunvor with her  past iGEM team experience has been a lot of help! We are naive students that want to come up with crazy ideas  that supervisors are too experienced to consider an opportunity. Our project this year is HIGH-risk and it was almost immediately clear to us that this was what we wanted to do this year. Considering the time-limit of iGEM it was an ambitious project and had everything gone as planned and expected we could have reached our goal. We believe the project has potential and should be further investigated. We've all enjoyed working as a team and learned tons about synthetic biology and the potential this field has feels unlimited! We have had a lot of fun, the life of a scientist is like a rollercoaster of ups and downs but the excitement and curiosity of research will always be a strong motivator!

After a lot of brainstorming, discussion and presentations in self-organized team meetings over the first months, we decided to work on a Microbial Fuel Cell, although this issue is very complex and there is hardly no expertise in this area of ​​research at our university.  iGEM-Team Bielefeld 2013 team members are probably the first people at the University of Bielefeld, who built an Microbial Fuel Cell.
All work described on this wiki or on our Partsregistry pages was done by ourselves. We managed the whole project, from planing to financing and the complete lab work by ourselves. Nevertheless, we could not have done all this work without the help, advice and guidance of several people. Hence, special thanks to the following people you can see under Acknowledgements part.

The Team
The iGEM-Team Bielefeld 2013: Fabian, Thorben, Anna, Matthias, Sebastian, Nadiya, Tore, Manuel, Tom, Lukas
Members
Lukas Rositzka
Studies: Molecular Biotechnology
Motivation: iGEM - for me as a student a unique and exciting opportunity to be part of a team of young and dedicated scientists beyond the confines of university seminars and to design, implement and present a joint project in synthetic biology.
Sebastian Grenz
Studies: Genome-based Systems Biology, Master
Motivation: I'm interested in working in an autonomously organized team and in developing a very own project from the planning stage through to successful completion. Synthetic biology offers, due to its modular structure, numerous opportunities for exciting projects. iGEM is considered the most prestigious competition in the field of life sciences and enables contact and competition with teams from around the world.
Tom Tubessing
Studies: Molecular Biotechnology, Bachelor
Motivation: The rapid development in the field of synthetic biology fascinates me over and over again. I am convinced, that the insights gained int this field could - if used responsibly - benefit everyone. I am participating in the iGEM competition with our team to implement own ideas an develope new Applications in this young scientific field.
Manuel Schüler
Studies: Molecular Biotechnology, Master
Motivation: iGEM ​​is a unique opportunity beside of the study to gain new skills and develop existing skills. From the idea to the product team members decide how they structure their project themselves and make the necessary decisions independently. It is a prestigious competition in the life sciences, which also accounts for the attraction at this high level to conduct research and to compete with international teams.
Matthias Ruwe
Studies: Molecular Biotechnology, Master
Motivation: I see iGEM as a huge opportunity to gain experience in many areas. What excites me particularly is to work as a team on a separate project,  to fully implement the ideas up to the presentation of the results and to work in areas such as human practices or public relations. I'm also fascinated that it is still allowed in this competition, or even desired, to implement unusual ideas and thereby realizing possibly great developments.
Thorben Meyer
Studies: Molecular Biotechnology, Bachelor
Motivation: For me, iGEM is about being creativ on a nanobiotechnological/engineering level and working application-oriented. So that we are able to give smart and plain answers to complex problems.
Tore Bleckwehl
Studies: Molecular Biotechnology, Bachelor
Motivation: I am interested in iGEM, because of the challenge to develop new metabolic pathways and to reprogram  biological systems by the intelligence combination of BioBricks. Apart I like the opportunity to develop and improve the own ideas in the team.
Fabian Thomas
Studies: Molecular Biotechnology, Bachelor
Motivation:I particularly love the fact that it is possible to use microscopic life to improve our macroscopic world. Due to their enormous variety, microorganisms may be involved, for example, in the analysis, production and degradation of pollutants on a wide range of subject areas. I like the interdisciplinarity and the enormous range of possibilities offered by synthetic biology.

Founding member of UGA-iGEM
Dr. Zhe Lyu, Post Doctoral Associate, Department of Microbiology
Affectionately nicknamed LZ by Barny, is a 100% Chinese postdoctoral research associate in William Barny Whitman’s lab. His family name used to be spelled as Lü in Chinese dictionary and textbooks, but just like mutations are constantly taking place in genes, “point mutation” soon changed the name into Lv or Lu when it’s exposed to the world of computers and internet. Unlike mutations emerging in genes, which is a process believed to be largely random. The arising of Lv or Lu is full of human design based upon convenient communication with computers – early computers just didn’t recognize ü. The newest and also the only internationally authorized design so far - Lyu, made its debut just a year ago, as officials might want to set things straight once-for-all. LZ probably prefers such designs would have never happened to him, since it introduces some kind of identity crisis and also brings up endless hassle when it comes to dealing with personal records. However, he sure wants to make it happen on genes – how cool it would be if one can design genes, right? A coin always has two sides – being deprived of the right to design his family name, LZ gets to design genes and operons to let them express in Methanococcus in Barny’s lab. Hopefully, those ongoing gene designs, including the ones for UGA-iGEM team, would tap the great biosynthetic potential of Methanococcus as well as Archaea; hence help to address some of the most challenging problems such as energy crisis and environmental pollution in the 21st century.
Narendran Sekar (Doctoral student, College of Engineering)
PhD student first yr. Biological Engineering
Narendran Sekar is a Phd graduate student in Nano electrochemistry Lab at College of Engineering.

We submitted and sequenced three biobricks integral to our project. These can be found below:
Loading.....
This year we submitted and characterised 3 BioBricks, one of which is an improvement of BBa_K925000 !
We used an existing BioBrick component with Constitutive promoter and RBS
(BBa_K608002) to express our BioBrick parts:
Successful Expression of delta 9 and delta 12 desaturase, and FabA
In order to characterise our biobricks, we made use of the standard parts found in the registry. By inserting the created biobricks BBa_K1027001 and BBa_K1027002 in to BBa_K608002 (a biobrick consisting of a ribosomal binding site and a constitutive promoter), we were able to create a new construct that expressed the delta 9 desaturase, delta 12 desaturase and FabA proteins. The constructs are shown above.
Plates
Another piece of evidence suggesting that our constructs were successfully expressing our delta 9 desaturase and delta 12 desaturase enzymes was the size of the colonies grown on the plates. Pictures of the plates are shown below. On the far left is a control plate, with bacteria transformed with BBa_K608002 but with no gene inserted in front of the promoter. To the right of that are our delta 12 colonies. They are much smaller than the control, and even taking 20 hours to grow to that size as opposed to the usual 16 hours. We hypothesise that because delta 12 desaturase is a membrane-bound protein that the E. coli does not normally express, constitutively expressing it could inhibit the bacteria and slow growth. Compare this to FabA on the far right. Looking through the literature, we found that overexpression of FabA results in no significant difference in growth size or speed relative to the wild type strain (Luo et al, 2009). Compared to the control plate, we also found that the colonies grew normally.
Gel Digests
To confirm that our desired genes were in fact within the expression construct mentioned above, we carried out test digests of our ligated plasmids. Happily, when we ran our digests on an agarose gel, we saw all of the bands we would predict from the expected fragments. The gel pictures are on the right.
delta 9 desaturase: Cut with BamHI + EcoRV. Expected bands 1424 bp, 1262 bp, 99 bp.
delta 12 desaturase: Cut with BamHI, XbaI, PstI. Expected bands 2127 bp, 656 bp, 430 bp.
FabA Cut with EcoRV. Expected bands 1429 bp, 1115 bp. Cut with EcoRV, PstI. Expected bands 1153 bp, 1115 bp, 339 bp.
Improvement of existing BioBrick
Our biobrick BBa_K1027002 (delta 12 desaturase) is an improvement of the BBa_K925000 biobrick created by the St Andrews team in 2012. We improved this biobrick from the ground up, starting by taking the protein sequence from Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. This protein sequence was reverse translated and then codon optimised for expression in E. coli. We believe our redesigned biobrick has two features that the original biobrick does not. Firstly, the original biobrick could not be transformed by iGEM HQ, whereas we have managed successful transformation (as shown by the plate pictures). Next, the St. Andrews biobrick was cloned from cyanobacteria, and so is not optimised for expression in E. coli. As St. Andrews then went on to express their delta 12 desaturase biobrick in E. coli it follows that a sequence optimised for expression in this chassis, as ours was, would perform better than the sequence naturally found in cyanobacteria.

Orbitrap LC-MS analysis
Delta 9 desaturase and delta 12 desaturase enzymes were chosen because their products, when expressed in their host organism (Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803), convert stearic acid into oleic acid, and oleic acid into linoleic acid respectively. Therefore, we fed batches of transformed DH5-alpha with 2 different concentrations of exogenous fatty acid (0.1% and 0.5% stearic acid fed to the delta 9 desaturase batch, and 0.1% and 0.5% oleic acid fed to the delta 12 desaturase batch), left the cultures growing overnight and then harvested the cells.
To analyse the metabolites extracted from both wild-type DH5-alpha and DH5-alpha expressing our delta 9 desaturase and delta 12 desaturase enzymes, we made use of the MIB’s in-house Orbitrap Liquid Chromatography - Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS). This technique was chosen because of its high mass accuracy and sensitivity. Upon analysing the most abundant metabolites extracted from our expression strains and comparing this data with the most abundant metabolites extracted from wild-type, it is apparent that a massive increase in linoleic acid (incorporated in phosphatidylethanolamines, PE) has occurred. This is demonstrated in the two figures directly below. The chromatograms produced for the delta 12 desaturase expression strains are also shown below. There is a clear difference between the wild-type E. coli fed with exogenous substrate compared with the E. coli strains expressing delta 12 desaturase. It is probable that the peak appearing around 7.9 min in the delta 12 desaturase strains is due to phospholipid incorporating 18:2 (9Z, 12Z) - linoleic acid.

Further analysis
The data obtained from the LC-MS was enormous. 2721 metabolites were detected in the samples, and so we filtered this down to the 43 fatty acids and phospholipids incorporating the compounds we were interested in (oleic acid and linoleic acid). A heat map was generated (seen above) showing the abundances of these 43 phospholipids and fatty acids in the 17 samples we run on the LC-MS. From this heatmap the diversity of detected compounds and high dynamic range can be seen. For the characterisation of our delta 12 desaturase BioBrick construct, a focus on the individual compounds of high intensity was necessary. An example of this can be seen in the bar chart above. Here you can see that, when fed with oleic acid (to a total w/v concentration of 0.1% and 0.5%), the amount of linoleic acid found within this representative phospholipid is much higher in the delta 12 desaturase expression strain than in the wild-type DH5-alpha strain. From this data we can confidently conclude that the delta 12 desaturase is converting the substrate oleic acid into the linoleic acid. Currently, the linoleic is incorporated into a phospholipid, but expression of the tesA gene (biobricked previously) would cleave the compound away to give free fatty acid.
A work flow of the methods we used to get from sample to data analysis can be seen above.

Atomic Force Microscopy
Whilst overexpression of the delta 12 desaturase led to a 4 fold increase in linoleic acid production incorporated in certain phospholipids, we had hypothesised that both overexpression of a non-native membrane protein and the resulting fatty acid composition changes would possibly alter E. coli membrane structure and potentially interfere growth and replication.  To address this, we performed Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) on transformed wild-type and E. coli transformed with our delta 12 desaturase expression construct. From this we found that there was no significant difference in the membranes between the wild-type and delta 12 desaturase expression constructs.  From this we can conclude that overexpression of the non-native membrane bound delta 12 desaturase using our constitutive promoter system does not significantly alter the membranes. Therefore on an industrial scale the expression construct could be modified, such as by the addition of a stronger promoter sequence and RBS site or potentially using inducible expression systems, thus resulting in a greater production of linoleic acid.

Attributions in detail
Project: the idea. We came to Wormboys after a couple of brainstorming meetings including all the team. It would be impossible to define authors here: we all contributed to     the design of the project.
The riding. Biofilm formation on C. elegans was attempted on Pseudomonas by Guillermo Zafrilla and finally achieved in E. coli by Samuel Miravet, Alba Iglesias and Guillermo Zafrilla, with the collaboration of Pedro Dorado. Pedro also prepared all samples for     electron microscopy by carefully following the instructions of Joaquín Baixeras, an entomologist of our University and an expert on S.E.M. (see     acknowledgements).
Biobricks. Pedro Dorado and Alba Iglesias performed all the work to amplify, clone and submit the Biobricks to the registry. Pedro and Alba also prepared most     of the characterization data for the Registry.
The Calling. Attraction experiments were designed and conducted by Samuel Miravet and Pedro Dorado, with the collaboration of Alba Corman.
The Clumping. E. coli , iRNA and worm altered behavior stuff was done by Samuel Miravet and Pedro Dorado.
The building. Plastic production, media characterization and field test experiment were performed by Pedro Dorado.
Software. Simuelegans, a program designed to run simulations in our modeling work, and C++ elegans, our image-based analysis software, were imagined and designed by Alejandro Valero.
Hardware. The Lego-based scanner was conceived and built by Marina Mañas and Alejandro Torres.
Human Practices. Alba Iglesias was in charge of a major part of the work on RRI, including the survey and the report. Samuel Miravet wrote in Spanish the book “Ten     tales on synthetic Biology” with the collaboration of Jessica de Loma, who translated all the original tales into English. All original     illustrations were by Alba Corman.
Modelling. Our engineering students (Tonny Ruiz, Alejandro Valero, Alejandro Torres and Marina Mañas) developed our modeling.
Wiki. Tonny Ruiz passionately designed, built and maintained the wiki. Graphic design and illustrations were done with the collaboration of Alba Corman.
Poster. We prepared two different posters, one for the European Jamboree and another for Boston. The former was designed and made by Alba Corman, Guillermo Zafrilla and Marina Mañas. The second was mainly prepared by Guillermo Zafrilla and Jessica de Loma.
Talk. Jessica de Loma led this important responsibility.
Other issues. General design was conducted by Tonny Ruiz and Alba Corman; communication and crowdfunding, internet videos and other dissemination     activities were done by Alba Corman and Alba Iglesias, with the collaboration of all the team.
Main advisors and supervisors
The truth is that not all of our supervisors did a hard work supervising Wormboys. Of these, two of the most active ones were graduate students. Their     implication in the project as well as their email addresses in case it was required to contact them, are as follows:
Wetlab work mainly supervised by Cristina Vilanova (PhD student: cristina.vilanova@uv.es) and Manuel Porcar (Researcher at the University of     Valencia. Instructor. manuel.porcar@uv.es)
Modelling. Mainly supervised by Lucas J. Morales (grad student. lujemomo@alumni.uv.es)
Human Practices. Supervised by Manuel Porcar.
Bioplastic and worms. Supervised by Marta Tortajada (Biopolis, SL, marta.tortajada@biopolis.es)
Communication and logistics. Juli Peretó (professor at University of Valencia).
Acknowledgements
We are indebted to Dr. Joaquín Baixeras (professor at the University of Valencia for his technical assistance ( joaquin.baixeras@uv.es ) with the scanning electron microscopy; to Soledad Rubio and Rafa García Martínez (University of Valencia) for making possible funding and logistics; to Paco de la Torre for his advices on general     design and layout; and, finally, to the staff in the University of Valencia who kindly helped us and made possible Wormboys.

Collaboration
We provided Itu igem team with biobricks they are going to use from the kit plates, for a double check, of the parts they were having a problem with. We hoped it worked for them. METU iGEM team and our team become very good friends during iGEM preperation. We are both iGEMers from Ankara so in every step, we helped each other very much. Last year we organised a picnic together and this year we went out for a beer and talked about biology, genetics and iGEM. We shared plasmids, we helped each other’s experiments sometimes, our Wİki Maker Burak gave them hand for their wiki page. They help us create equations for our project modelling.  We invited them for this year’s “Study Groups Symposium” in our school and they gave us a presentation about iGEM and their project. Our instructor went to METU for “Synthetic Biology Days” and she gave a presentation about iGEM and our project. So, we know all about each other’s work now and we can’t wait for having fun in Europe Jamboree together. Being in Lyon together will be a great experience for both Ankara teams!

From 2013.igem.org
Yanfeng He
I believe that the synthetic biology has great potential to change the world, and it’s a good way to make the world a better place to live. I want to do some research about gastrointestinal microbiota and to learn how to cure those gastrointestinal diseases. My motto is ""Tomorrow is another day! Strive for the best!""
Yaqiu Wang
""Scientists investigate that which already is. Technologists create that which has never been."" From a fermentation background, I am intrigue by the sense of achievement when observing my little creatures thriving in their destinies I designed. I’d like to be a technologist in the future career. But successes just occur occasionally with failures and despairs in most cases. That’s why I like to eat with our team members, to exercise with my friends, to talk, to relife, to make sense of all the unhappiness and happiness, which means, I’m pursuing being a scientist of my daily life.
Tianyi Hao
I'm Tianyi Hao from CAU since I'm in senior grade. I was one of the earliest members in our team. I have a responsibility to manage the cost of our team. I am addicted to iGEM prgram, which can expand my imagination and improve my practical experiences that really make me love it. Although this is our first time to take the competition, I eager to our team can do a good job!
Qiuyu Fu
Life is simple and life is complex. However to human’s surprise, almost all forms of life share the same basic components. There are rules to connect simple form and complex apparent just like the game of go .I believe all those rules will come out in same simple way. To pursue those rules is my lifelong career and nothing could make me more excited. I graduate from CAU and my specialized field is calculation biology. Hoping my effort could partly contribute to CAU iGem team's achievement.
Sheng Wang
I'm an undergraduate of CAU,CBS and now doing research on human genetics. As one of the oldest members in our iGEM, I have witnessed the growth of our team. I hope our ideas can amaze you! And I hope our teams can be better and better!
Zhenhai Du
Hello, everyone! I am Zhenhai Du, an undergraduate student from CAU. I has worked with the other guys for one year. The experience is an unforgettable journey for me. I enjoyed the synthetic biology so much that I’m doing research on artificial mitochondria now. I have no other words. Just pay your attention on us!
Wenhong Cui
Cui wenhong, an undergraduate in his senior year, is an optimistic and hardworking man. He aims at science research and likes football very much. During the whole project, he thinks a lot and takes much experiment together with other team members.
Xiaofei Song
I am a senior undergraduate student in College of Biology Science. The complex and logical system of life attract me a lot. I think it’s a good way to study the complicate system by abstracting basic parts out firstly. I mainly respond for the modeling and acid-resistant strains screening. IGEM brings me a great fun time!
Dan Li
Hi! I’m Dan li. I am an undergraduate from China Agricultural University .I join in the CAU_China Team one year ago. I love science, especially the uncertainty it brings to me! In short, because of love , curiosity and guts, here I come!
Yuan Wang
I am a rising junior at China Agricultural University majoring in Biological Science. My current professional interests are molecular biology, cell biology, and synthetic biology. I focus on  the work relating to molecular cloning operation, such as construction of various basic plasmid backbones. Thanks for iGEM which provides an opportunity for me to make some awesome bacteria. I really have a wonderful time this summer as a part of the CAU iGEM team and learn a lot.
You Wu
Hi, my name is You and nice to see you. Maybe I’m a mix of Wendy, Dorothy, Anne and Alice from those cute storybooks so every day I discover more and more beautiful things. And books, pictures and other artworks are always on my mind. I’m responsible for the art related works and other interesting missions (e.g. asking questions) in our team. It’s a joy to work in our team since everyone wants this summer to be special and We Are Smart :D
Mengni Wang
I major in the science of biology in Agriculture University as an undergraduate and take up Applied Mathematics as a second degree. I dream to study biological science with the help of the essence of mathematics and do something big of innovation and originality in science. I am enthusiastic at volunteering and work as the captain of volunteers of the college biological science in my university in 2013-2014. My hobbies are watching movies, painting ,playing badminton and chess. What distinguishes me most-smiling.
Meiwen Wang
I have been in Li Lab for more than half a year, working on magnetotactic bacterium, so amazing a creature! In daily life, I prefer doing some reading about medical science or literature. And to tell the truth, I’m also a completest to some extent, which really exhausts me sometimes. Very fortunately, I’ve got so many good friends since I joined this team. Everybody here is excellent and special. For my part, acid resistance domestication of E.coli(BL21) was the main work.
Ji Xia
It is very important that we can design a experiment by ourselves, and make what we thought into reality, which really attracts me. Though research is interesting,  some mistake often happen on my experiment. Maybe  i cannot do things well in the first time,  but i believe efforts can make up for it.I love doing things cool, just like experiment!
Peng Qin
Peng Qin, or Roc, not freshman for iGEM’s work, but green hand for this project in lab. Appreciate this chance to apply the learned from course and books, acquire lab skills, develop scientific mind, meet great people and get the passion to drive me. Love to work on things interests or excites me without self-control, which means ignore the cost of time and energy.Synthetic Biology is an excellent tool to win the great power for mankind. All for human.

Recep Erdem Ahan: Hi all, I am Recep erdem Ahan team captain of ITU MOBGAM Team. I was born and continue to live in Istanbul. It is a lovely city to live if you can ignore some negative parts. After I watched X-man, Heroes, Fantastic Four , glowing rabbits and stuff like that, I am impressed by science of genetics and molecular biology. Now, I am last year student in Molecular Biology and Genetics Deparment in ITU. Moreover, I do double major in Chemistry. I met iGEM and synthetic biology two years ago. After doing couple researches and reading articles , I had thought that it has a potential to human life better. My searches interests are Omics Sciences, Bio- and Nano- technology, System Biology, Cancer and of course Synthetic biology. I want to pursue my carrer in academic way (at least I want to take PhD.) Besides all, in my free time I would like to watch movies, hang out with friends, smoke waterpipe, walking the Istiklal Street. Also, I am a daydreamer and enjoy to dream that I can fly without wings.
Eren Şahin: Eren is a last year student in Molecular Biology and Genetics. This is his first year in iGEM. He decided to join iGEM because he felt that synthetic biology has an unprecedented power in influencing the future of biology. He wanted to carry out his knowledge and imagination into building creative and innovative applications. The idea of working with a team of undergraduates  seemed truly fascinating as well. All in all, he believes iGEM provides a unique opportunity to develop something that can have a tangible, positive impact on the world of synthetic biology. Lastly, when i am not busy in the labs (like that ever happens), I enjoy being out having great adventures.  Outside of school my favourite activities are “goy goy” and to take pictures. (By the way, the meaning of “goy goy” is to chat with friends:D).
Behide Saltepe (Evil Queen): This is Behide Saltepe from ITU MOBGAM iGEM Team. I am one of the vice presidents at our team. This is my fourth, and last, year at Molecular Biology and Genetics department in Istanbul Technical University. I met with iGEM competition this year, as my friends. Although I am interested mostly in neuroscience, I want to discover the facilities of synthetic biology as a different interest area for me. Also I believe that researching on a project would bring lots of experience us at all aspects. That’s why I am in the team! Out of the lab, I really enjoy dancing, especially Latin dances are my area of interests. During experiments, we are listening music, singing, and dancing, lab is so exciting for us! Most importantly, my favorite hobby is travelling in Istanbul, because I fall in love with Istanbul! It is so fascinating city with all its beauty!
Büşra Ahata: Hi there, I'm Büşra:) I'm senior student at Department of Molecular Biology and Genetics and one of the proud members of wet lab in first iGEM team in ITU. I had full hands at the time I was working for IGEM because I was also working on a biotechnology company. But it was never a burden, because I always believe that IGEM provides us great opportunities to learn about technical and laborative developments. I have been always interested in biology, also I had great interest in synthetic biology which i couldn't quite improve until my juniour class at ITU. Now, I can gladly say that being iGEM member satisfy my curiosity about the subject. Moreover,preparing a project, and learning of it's entire steps are fullfilled by IGEM project and my teammates. Besides all the scientific addition that IGEM provides oneself, a person can learn to be a part of a team, to be confident with the things you create all together, and absolutely there is success you can experience by IGEM. Not even mentioning the fun we had! See you in the upcoming years fellows:)
Tuğçe Önür: I am a senior student in the Department of Molecular Biology and Genetic. iGEM is the great chance to get wet-lab and research experience for me. I have already interested in biotechnology/microbiology and now I am aware of I really want to engage in these types of research. I worked on kill-switch module in our project. In addition; travelling, camping, natural sports and taking photos are the other things that make me happy.
Seda Karabacak: Hi everyone, I am Seda  This is the last year for me at Mathematical Engineering department in ITU and first year at iGEM like all other friends. I am responsible for modelling and web site design. Let see “How I met iGEM?”.. One day after the lesson, one of my friend who is Recep (Our Godfather), suggested me to join the team. I’d never thought being a member of such a team but I said myself “Why not, it can be great opportunity” and than I accepted his suggestion. I never regretted even ones and always glad to be a part of iGEM. Because I learnt so many things thanks to iGEM competition. Many thanks to all team member and iGEM…
Mertcan Akyürek: Hello everyone! I am Can. I am studying Engineering Physics as a senior student.  Since I am interested in biology, genetics, neuroscience, biophysics, computers and programming, as well, I've taken part in this team to help my team mates for modelling and website designing. I am glad to be in iGEM so that I can improve my knowledge and skills. Apart from the academic dimension -the boring part, I have hobbies irrelevant with each other but mostly I fill my days with watching movies, dancing and swimming.
Boğaç Erçığ: Salut ! This is Bogac. I am from Istanbul Tech like the others. I have been working on biotechnology field for a really long time and then i got really bored. Now I have graduated but i am still trying to support my team by all means. I am doing a Master which is called ""in silico drug design"" - btw this is a joint master in France between Strasbourg and Paris -. And now i am looking for some new excitements in silico world. Actually I am one of the people who brought an idea to create an iGEM team, but Recep and his friends took it from theory to practice. They made people get familiar with synthetic biology and set up a really hard-working team and now we are here. Even I have pic here. That's cool! It is really great to be a part of this competition.
Cahit Haktan Çağlar: I study Department of Mol Bio and Genetics at ITU and third year in this department. I like doing taekwondo. I’m interested in research about diagnoses and treatment of genetic diseases. The biggest thing that ı enjoy at the end ofthe day to sleep idly.
Can Gürkaşlar: I’m Can Gurkaslar a second year student at the Molecular Biology and Genetics Department in ITU and this is my first year at iGEM with along with my other friends. First time I hear synthetic biology is at iGEM presentation and I love the way we can play with our little friends and I thought joining iGEM team would be a good lab experience.
Deniz Kınık: Hi I’m Deniz  =) I’m 2nd  year student at Molecular Biology and Genetics department in ITU. I am responsible for human practice in general and I have worked as a lab assistant, so, I got the opportunity to learn new techniques from our team members who have more knowledge. That was one of my goals to participate in iGEM. My first thougt when I considered joining the team was whether I will be useful for the team or not and I was fussy about it. But I got rid of all the hesitates thanks to our team leader and the team spirit, so, the stressful and funny year was started . This year, we have learned not only about synthetic biology but also thinking for new ideas, working as a team, overcoming stress…sooo thanks to iGEM =)
Dilek Gülsima Usluer (Belieber): I am Dilek Gulsima Usluer and I am a four year student of Molecular Biology and Genetics department of Istanbul Technical University. I am working in both wet lab and human practice divisions of ITU_MOBGAM team. I always believe that there are too many things to do and much more things to learn in the world of science. This is why I wanted to be involved in an IGEM project. With the help of IGEM competition, I have met with a new field of biology, synthetic biology. I have also learned how a project can be constructed. Moreover, experiencing the team work with such a lovely team was priceless. I think IGEM competition is worth to try even if you are not deeply interested with the field of synthetic biology. As I said above, there are too many things to do and much more things to learn.
Güleycan Lütfullahoğlu: I am Güleycan Lutfullahoğlu. When we started this project, I was a second grade student, with a little knowledge, but now, I am starting third grade with much more experience. We, second grades, take part mostly in the human practice project, making videos, arranging meetings and making street interviews. It was a lot of fun to observe the reaction of people about synthetic biology. It was also a lot of experience for me to take part in the lab as an assistant as much as possible. It was so nice to contribute to the team this year and I am also looking forward to enjoying  the next year with much more knowledge.
Güliz Otkıran: I am appreciated IGEM to provide us to contribute our vision,  keep alive our scientific attention and promote the science and give oppurtunity to explore the project source which grows year by year, however I found  the fees as restrictor to motive the youth to science. To introduce myself microbiology, immunology, human genome, evolution and neuroscience  are the topics that interest me more. Other than these, any kind of art, especially painting and drawing, comics, anime, heavy metal – not the element but music one – , far eastern cuisine and classical literature novels are enough to entertain me in my social life. Last, there is a quote I really like and want to share with you is “Ever tried. Ever failed. No matter. Try again. Fail again. Fail better.”
Mahir Bozan: Hey iGEM, I am Mahir and studying my bachelor in field of Molecular Biology and Genetics at ITU. Additionally, I have also studied at Roskilde University in Molecular Biology program as an exchange student for last two semesters. It was pleasure for me to be head of Molecular Biology and Genetics Student Club in 2011-2012 academic year. In one of our club meeting, our one of the club member talked about iGEM and my huge interest to iGEM began from that moment. After a long way, finally, we are in iGEM and I am really glad to be part of this competition with such a good team. Molecular Biology is not only my interest, I have also curiosity to architecture, science of physics, film art, painting and also theater. I have lots of interests to say because I believe that knowledge is something endless and I should learn them as much as I can in my entire life.
Mehmet Akdağ: I am Mehmet Akdağ. I’m a second year student at Molecular Biology and Genetics Department in ITU. This year I contributed generally the human practice part of our project and I also worked as lab assistant when I find a chance. Having limited lab experience forced me to become an iGEM member. I learn lots of lab techniques from our advisors and our senior students. I become familiar with synthetic biology which I really like and if I got a chance, I want to work on this field in future. Since it is the first iGEM team found in our university it was hard and stressful year for all of us but I really enjoyed being a member of our ITU iGEM Team.
Nazif Taşbaş: Hello there. I’m Nazif Tasbas. I’m currently studying at Istanbul Technical University Molecular Biology And Genetics Dept. On this year’s project, i mainly focused on human practice, events, social media etc. Mostly i tweet from our twitter account @ituigem. Generally I shoot photos and videos on human practice events with my mobile. I participated in wetlab whenever possible but generally watched to learn something. We don’t get enough experience on our lab courses and we have to improve it. This train of thought lead me to our university’s first iGEM Team. In future, i’m thinking of neurobiology as my primary tendency. You may think that synthetic biology has no resemblance with neurobiology but i love how synthetic biology works. I was amazed when i hear some projects from previous years like Stanford’s “Hell Cell” or Kyoto’s “Emerging The Titanic”. Thinking outside the box and applying these thoughts on real life world is amazing. As i said, synthetic biology is fun. Maybe one day, we can make synthetic neurological pathways, neuron cell networks or an entire brain. On that day, the resemblance will be unraveled.
Sibel Karaman: Hi, I’m Sibel, my third year in department of Molecular Biology and Genetics in ITU and as my team mates, my first year in iGEM team. In our team, I take part in wet lab. In my opinion, it is important to learn the experimental fields in molecular biology. iGEM provides the opportunity to get experience in molecular biology. It is a good feeling that being part of a team and studying together, so, I learn as well as have fun in the laboratory. And finally, I think iGEM provides me a big opportunity to have sufficient experience on synthetic biology.

Apart from the academic dimension -the boring part, I have hobbies irrelevant with each other but mostly I fill my days with watching movies, dancing and swimming.
Boğaç Erçığ: Salut ! This is Bogac. I am from Istanbul Tech like the others. I have been working on biotechnology field for a really long time and then i got really bored. Now I have graduated but i am still trying to support my team by all means. I am doing a Master which is called ""in silico drug design"" - btw this is a joint master in France between Strasbourg and Paris -. And now i am looking for some new excitements in silico world. Actually I am one of the people who brought an idea to create an iGEM team, but Recep and his friends took it from theory to practice. They made people get familiar with synthetic biology and set up a really hard-working team and now we are here. Even I have pic here. That's cool! It is really great to be a part of this competition.
Cahit Haktan Çağlar: I study Department of Mol Bio and Genetics at ITU and third year in this department. I like doing taekwondo. I’m interested in research about diagnoses and treatment of genetic diseases. The biggest thing that ı enjoy at the end ofthe day to sleep idly.
Can Gürkaşlar: I’m Can Gurkaslar a second year student at the Molecular Biology and Genetics Department in ITU and this is my first year at iGEM with along with my other friends. First time I hear synthetic biology is at iGEM presentation and I love the way we can play with our little friends and I thought joining iGEM team would be a good lab experience.
Deniz Kınık: Hi I’m Deniz  =) I’m 2nd  year student at Molecular Biology and Genetics department in ITU. I am responsible for human practice in general and I have worked as a lab assistant, so, I got the opportunity to learn new techniques from our team members who have more knowledge. That was one of my goals to participate in iGEM. My first thougt when I considered joining the team was whether I will be useful for the team or not and I was fussy about it. But I got rid of all the hesitates thanks to our team leader and the team spirit, so, the stressful and funny year was started . This year, we have learned not only about synthetic biology but also thinking for new ideas, working as a team, overcoming stress…sooo thanks to iGEM =)
Dilek Gülsima Usluer (Belieber): I am Dilek Gulsima Usluer and I am a four year student of Molecular Biology and Genetics department of Istanbul Technical University. I am working in both wet lab and human practice divisions of ITU_MOBGAM team. I always believe that there are too many things to do and much more things to learn in the world of science. This is why I wanted to be involved in an IGEM project. With the help of IGEM competition, I have met with a new field of biology, synthetic biology. I have also learned how a project can be constructed. Moreover, experiencing the team work with such a lovely team was priceless. I think IGEM competition is worth to try even if you are not deeply interested with the field of synthetic biology. As I said above, there are too many things to do and much more things to learn.
Güleycan Lütfullahoğlu: I am Güleycan Lutfullahoğlu. When we started this project, I was a second grade student, with a little knowledge, but now, I am starting third grade with much more experience. We, second grades, take part mostly in the human practice project, making videos, arranging meetings and making street interviews. It was a lot of fun to observe the reaction of people about synthetic biology. It was also a lot of experience for me to take part in the lab as an assistant as much as possible. It was so nice to contribute to the team this year and I am also looking forward to enjoying  the next year with much more knowledge.
Güliz Otkıran: I am appreciated IGEM to provide us to contribute our vision,  keep alive our scientific attention and promote the science and give oppurtunity to explore the project source which grows year by year, however I found  the fees as restrictor to motive the youth to science. To introduce myself microbiology, immunology, human genome, evolution and neuroscience  are the topics that interest me more. Other than these, any kind of art, especially painting and drawing, comics, anime, heavy metal – not the element but music one – , far eastern cuisine and classical literature novels are enough to entertain me in my social life. Last, there is a quote I really like and want to share with you is “Ever tried. Ever failed. No matter. Try again. Fail again. Fail better.”
Mahir Bozan: Hey iGEM, I am Mahir and studying my bachelor in field of Molecular Biology and Genetics at ITU. Additionally, I have also studied at Roskilde University in Molecular Biology program as an exchange student for last two semesters. It was pleasure for me to be head of Molecular Biology and Genetics Student Club in 2011-2012 academic year. In one of our club meeting, our one of the club member talked about iGEM and my huge interest to iGEM began from that moment. After a long way, finally, we are in iGEM and I am really glad to be part of this competition with such a good team. Molecular Biology is not only my interest, I have also curiosity to architecture, science of physics, film art, painting and also theater. I have lots of interests to say because I believe that knowledge is something endless and I should learn them as much as I can in my entire life.
Mehmet Akdağ: I am Mehmet Akdağ. I’m a second year student at Molecular Biology and Genetics Department in ITU. This year I contributed generally the human practice part of our project and I also worked as lab assistant when I find a chance. Having limited lab experience forced me to become an iGEM member. I learn lots of lab techniques from our advisors and our senior students. I become familiar with synthetic biology which I really like and if I got a chance, I want to work on this field in future. Since it is the first iGEM team found in our university it was hard and stressful year for all of us but I really enjoyed being a member of our ITU iGEM Team.
Nazif Taşbaş: Hello there. I’m Nazif Tasbas. I’m currently studying at Istanbul Technical University Molecular Biology And Genetics Dept. On this year’s project, i mainly focused on human practice, events, social media etc. Mostly i tweet from our twitter account @ituigem. Generally I shoot photos and videos on human practice events with my mobile. I participated in wetlab whenever possible but generally watched to learn something. We don’t get enough experience on our lab courses and we have to improve it. This train of thought lead me to our university’s first iGEM Team. In future, i’m thinking of neurobiology as my primary tendency. You may think that synthetic biology has no resemblance with neurobiology but i love how synthetic biology works. I was amazed when i hear some projects from previous years like Stanford’s “Hell Cell” or Kyoto’s “Emerging The Titanic”. Thinking outside the box and applying these thoughts on real life world is amazing. As i said, synthetic biology is fun. Maybe one day, we can make synthetic neurological pathways, neuron cell networks or an entire brain. On that day, the resemblance will be unraveled.
Sibel Karaman: Hi, I’m Sibel, my third year in department of Molecular Biology and Genetics in ITU and as my team mates, my first year in iGEM team. In our team, I take part in wet lab. In my opinion, it is important to learn the experimental fields in molecular biology. iGEM provides the opportunity to get experience in molecular biology. It is a good feeling that being part of a team and studying together, so, I learn as well as have fun in the laboratory. And finally, I think iGEM provides me a big opportunity to have sufficient experience on synthetic biology.

Students
We are 'happy tree friends' who found that the concept of synthetic biology is what they've dreamt of in high school.  Fascinated by biology, fascinated by computer science. Studying on two faculties, on two universities that have created a joint curriculum for people like us - bioinformatics. We mix biology and computing science in one test-tube  to find our 'bioinfo' way.

About Our Team
It all started when two wandering friends heard about the epic quest of iGEM, immediately they knew they want to embark on this adventure. A band of 12 undergrad-adventurers from 10 different disciplines was then assembled for this pioneering quest.  Against all odds they managed to learn about iGEM and introduce it to the Uni. Along with public, recruit the instructors, raise the funds create the project and get to the finals!  In some encounters it is hinted that they even had fun! We are the first team from Ben Gurion University and the only Israeli team to participate this year. To get to know us personally, move your mouse over the picture above!

Composed of twelve undergraduates and one graduate student, the Virginia iGEM Team incorporates biologists, bioethicists, and biomedical, chemical, & mechanical engineers. The team is especially young with 6 second year, 3 third year, and 3 fourth year undergraduates. We are an accomplished group of students, including one United States Presidential Scholar, two National Merit Scholars, one Coca-Cola Scholar, one Jefferson Scholar, one Rodman Scholar, three Echols Scholars, one College Science Scholar, and two Eagle Scouts. In addition, there's a rumor that we even know how to have fun. When not furiously working in the lab, researching journal articles, or programming our wiki, the 2013 Virginia iGEM Team can often be found playing basketball, buying out the local farmer’s market, or taking sunrise hikes on the numerous mountains surrounding Charlottesville.
Wahoowa!

Christopher Morton
Interested in all types of science, and finding the new area of synthetic biology greatly rewarding. Helped build the first iGEM team at the University of Leicester in 2012 as the project leader, learning so many key skills along the way. joined the 2013 team to help out as an advisor to continue my support to the Leicester iGEM team.
Duccio Conti
Undergraduates
Anton Corvinus
My name is Anton and I'm interested in different sciences, but primarily in biology and genetics. The particular areas of biology that interest me are: regenerative medicine, gerontology and their genetic basis. I joined iGEM team because I wanted to get experience of working in the lab as researcher and see if I, as part of team can achieve reasonable results.
Alice Haworth
I am Alice Haworth , studying Medical Biochemistry. Found my way to iGEM while looking for summer lab experience. I joined a little late but I soon got in to the swing of things. I mostly enjoyed the lab work but it was good fun getting to know the team.
Brett Vahkal
I am doing a Bsc in Medical Biochemistry. I saw the iGEM as an excellent opportunity to do something exciting in the summer and I really liked the idea that students get to pursue their own novel research ideas in synthetic biology. It is a great project to be involved in and I am very happy to have been part of it.
Dupsy Solomon
My name is Oluwamodupe Ayeni and I am a 3rd year Physiology with Pharmacology student at the University of Leicester. I have always enjoyed science because it’s challenging and fun. Hence when I heard about synthetic biology, I was fascinated and at the same time eager to explore this new field of science. iGEM is a great project, it encourages innovation, creativity, flexibility , decision-making, problem-solving and team working skills. I have enjoyed every moment of it and would definitely recommend it to anyone with a passion for science.
Quezia Toe
My name is Quezia Toe I'm a third year Medical Genetics student at the University of Leicester. I have always been fascinated by how the natural world around us function and this fascination led me to my love of genetics. Synthetic biology not only allows me to understand how biological system works, but also enables me to use this knowledge to manipulate these systems for a useful purpose. Joining the iGEM team gave the opportunity to learn and use synthetic biology.
Parmdeep Kullar
I am a third year Biological Sciences student and take physiology and pharmacology and microbiology modules. iGEM has been a great way to learn about various lab techniques and new research and work as part of a team to attend events and fund-raise. I am happy to be part of this project as it builds on many skills which are required in later life and the jamboree in Lyon is a good incentive to work towards. It has been an enjoyable experience and has reflected my interest in science.
Where we're from
We're from the University of Leicester, located in the UK. The University was founded in 1921 and gained  University Status by Royal Charter in 1957. It is perhaps most famous for the discovery of DNA fingerprinting by Professor Sir Alec Jeffreys FRS (one of our generous sponsors!). It is also home to the Genetics Education Network for Innovation and Exellence (GENIE), the UK's Centre for Excellence in Teaching and Learning in Genetics.

The experimental work in the lab, computational modeling and the webpage was done by team members only. Every student had a responsibility for a particular task but of course work in the lab as well as on the wiki. Meret was responsible for the human practice, optimization and cloning, Parvathi for the proof of principle experiments with GFP, Angela for the hydrolase tests, Matthias for the promoter library, Susanna for the Model and Fabian for the WIKI.
We thank our advisors for their continuous support in result interpretation, trouble shooting and debugging of the experiments, model and the WIKI.

The team
We are a team of seven Bachelor and Master students with some pretty cool advisors from the Department of Biosystems Science and Engineering at ETH. If you're around Basel, be sure to visit our team's lab to play some really fun Colisweeper!
Bachelor students
Fabian ""Fab-Lab"" Wolter
Biotechnology Student
S like superman ? Too mainstream !It's S like sweeping !!
I'm sweeping out all the scary mines and save the Coli's on the game board. In my free time I chill out waiting for an emergency call of the lab in case some mines would escape..
By the way when i'm not saving the labs from E.coli mines, I work in it with pretty cool people and code some stuff on the WIKI.
Matthias ""Mad-lab"" Niederberger
Biotechnology Student
In the lab I do all your everyday tasks from pouring agar plates to miniprepping. My main responsibilities are primer design and promoter mutation.
I also do some work on the wiki and documentation of our parts in the registry.

Brainstorming and research
All 13 team members participated in the brainstorming and research, under the guidance of last years’ team members. Team member Wenjun Wang came up with the original idea for the artificial organelle and Yu Wang with the original idea for the RNA guardian.
Lab work
Wet lab work was divided into two parts: artificial organelle construction and RNA device building. The organelle group consists of Wenjun Wang, Xiaodong Zhong, Qianyun Lu, Kaili Qin, Mengqi Sun. The RNA group consists of Yu Wang, Qiu Wang, Xue Sun. There are eight wet lab members in total.
Safety
Subjects on safety were discussed among the team. Safety form was finished by Mengqi Sun. Lab management was carried out by Wenjun Wang, Xiaodong Zhong and Hong Li at the first stage of the project, whom were later replaced by Yu Wang, Xue Sun and Mengqi Sun(QIBEBT).
Modeling
Dry lab member Lei Zhong established the model for the magnetic detection module, and Xu Lin built the model for the RNA guardian.
Wiki Design
Wiki was designed by Yuchen Zheng, assisted by Hong Li. Wiki design was guided by Past team member Yong Peng. We express great gratitude for his generous contribution.
Human Practice
Team OUC-China always observes active performance in the field of human practice. This year, Mengqi Sun was in Charge of human practice, and we could not have completed the immense workload without the help of Xiaodong Zhong, Wenjun Wang, Yu Wang, Qiu Wang, Xue Sun, Hong Li, adviser Li Kang and all the other members and friends that helped out.
Funding
Xue Sun handled all of the team's expenses, while Xiaodong Zhong seeked funding through various means. We thank all the guidance in financial issues given by past team member Li Kang.
Sponsors
We would like to thank Ocean University of China for financial fundings, Lab Center of College of Marine Life Science for our lab, and lab space in QIBEBT.
We are extremely grateful for our Magnetospirillum Magneticum AMB-1 strain provided by Dr. Xiao Tian and the mamC::GFP fusion protein plasmid provided by Prof. Wu Longfei.

Our Team
2013 SJTU-BioX-Shanghai is composed of 12 students , two Instructors and three Advisors . This is the 5th time for our school to participate in iGEM.
Our Team
Our understanding to synthetic biology grows with every paper we read, every lecture we attend and every idea we proposed. Start with passion, we come together because of a common dream to design something cool, something brand-new and something that is applicable. We are also attracted to the broad and promising future of synthetic biology, hoping that this competition can be our debut in making contributions to human health, energy resources, research and any other field with synthetic biological methods.
There are innumerable brilliant ideas in the brain storming. There are fierce discussions in the lab meeting. There are obstacles in experiments. There are busy bodies working into midnight. We laugh, we enjoy. We argue, we improve. One thing that never changes is our trust to each other. We are teammates, we are friends, we are family. Another thing that will not change is our confidence in our project and our dream. That is what keeps us moving forward without fear.
Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU)
An imperial edict issued in 1896 by Emperor Guangxu, established Nanyang Public School in Shanghai. The normal school, school of foreign studies, middle school and a high school were established. Sheng Xuanhuai, the person responsible for proposing the idea to the emperor, became the first president and is regarded as the founder of the university.
Shanghai Jiao Tong University
Since the reform and opening up policy in China, SJTU has taken the lead in management reform of institutions for higher education, regaining its vigor and vitality with an unprecedented momentum of growth. SJTU includes five beautiful campuses, Xuhui, Minhang, Luwan Qibao, and Fahua, taking up an area of about 3,225,833 m2. A number of disciplines have been advancing towards the top echelon internationally, and a batch of burgeoning branches of learning have taken an important position domestically.
Today SJTU has 31 schools (departments), 63 undergraduate programs, 250 masters-degree programs, 203 Ph.D. programs, 28 post-doctorate programs, and 11 state key laboratories and national engineering research centers.
SJTU boasts a large number of famous scientists and professors, including 33 academics of the Academy of Sciences and Academy of Engineering, 92 accredited professors and chair professors of the ""Cheung Kong Scholars Program"" and more than 1,900 professors and associate professors.
After more than a century of operation, Jiao Tong University has inherited the old tradition of ""high starting points, solid foundation, strict requirements and extensive practice."" Students from SJTU have won top prizes in various competitions, including ACM International Collegiate Programming Contest, International Mathematical Contest in Modeling and Electronics Design Contests.  More than 200 of the academics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and Chinese Academy of Engineering are alumni of Jiao Tong University.

Bio-X Institutes
The Bio-X Institutes of Shanghai Jiao Tong University was formed in 2005 by merging the Neuropsychiatric and Human Genetics Group (NHGG), which was established in 1996, and the Bio-X Life Science Research Center, which was established in April 2000.
Bio-X Institutes
The founding of the Bio-X Institutes represents a landmark in interdisciplinary research among the life sciences. The mission of the Institutes is to provide not only an interdisciplinary institute, but also to serve as a forum for discussion among scientists and students from a variety of disciplines and fields.
The current director of the Institutes is Prof. Lin He, a fellow of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and the honorary director is Prof. Steve Zhu, physics Nobel Laureate. The Institutes consist of a number of ""core"" and ""satellite"" groups lead by dozens of distinguished scientists and specially appointed professors from China and abroad, as well as many highly-talented post-graduates and research fellows from various academic backgrounds all being supported by a team of administrative professionals and research technicians.
The research at the Bio-X Institutes focuses on interdisciplinary topics between nutrition, health& disease, development and reproduction, biosaftey and DNA computing. More in detail, we currently have research programs in genome mapping and cloning, functional genomics, pharmacogenomics, proteomics, psychiatric metabolism, DNA computing, bioinformatics and nation-wide protection of genetic resources.

Dundee iGEM Team would like to thank everyone for their contributions small and large.
A number of groups and individuals aided us over the course of our project and we would like to express our thanks.
First and foremost, we are indebted to our advisors and supervisors for their roles in the project. Prof. Tracy Palmer, Prof. Frank Sargent and Dr Fordyce Davidson tirelessly supervised and guided the team, helping us to realise our goals. These supervisors organised the team, attained funding partnerships and gave the team an environment in which ideas were allowed to grow and flourish. The support and encouragement offered by these individuals was a catalyst for progress and we cannot thank them enough for this.
Our advisors (Richard Owen, Lucia Licandro, Ciaran Kelly and Grant Buchanan) were our primary source of advice in terms of our project timetable, sources of errors and for iGEM in general. Having taken part in iGEM in 2011, Richard and Lucia were able to relate to the team and provide critical feedback on the best uses of our time and what we should focus on. Ciaran Kelly, an advisor for the Dundee iGEM team in 2011, was able to provide much needed feedback from a more external perspective. Grant Buchanan aided the wet team in many respects from offering the use of reagents and providing guidance on their work to sharing anecdotes and wisdom.
Furthermore, we would like to thank the Division of Molecular Microbiology (MMB) at the University of Dundee. This division hosted this year’s iGEM team, providing lab and working space for the duration of the project along-side the use of research grade equipment for the project. The welcoming and approachable nature of the researchers within the division meant that the team felt at ease from day one. The considerable experience and knowledge of these researchers was an invaluable resource which the team came to depend upon and greatly appreciate. Not to mention the patience and understanding with which members of the department dealt with mistakes and errors on the part of the team.
We would like to extend a heartfelt thank you to ALL of the members of the MMB for their support over the summer.
Special thanks to:
Jacqueline Heilbronn
The magical MMB lab manager with an extraordinary ability of being able to help with any problem you ever have. We cannot thank Jackie enough for her help.

A transformer so I can be anything I want to be..
Kyle Harrison
Field: Applied Computing
Role: Software Development / Design
If you could be anything what would you be?
A toaster because everyone likes toast.
Rachel Findlay
Field: Mathematical Biology
Role: Mathematical Modelling
If you could be anything what would you be?
An Axolotl so I can regenerate my own limbs and live underwater.
Nasir Ahmad
Field: Physics
Role: Hardware Designer /  Modelling
If you could be anything what would you be? :
Thunder in the middle of a rainstorm because it’s absolutely lovely
Ewa Grabowiecka
Field: Microbiology
Role: Biological Mop
If you could be anything?
Grumpy Cat. I would inherit a great deal of charisma, the ability to sleep forever and fabulous fur; Yet people would still find me adorable and I would become an internet sensation without even doing anything.
Philip Rodger
Field: Molecular Biology
Role: Microcystin Detector
If you could be anything what would you be?
I want to be a sloth because they live the simple life.
John Allan
Field: Microbiology
Role: Biological Mop
If you could be anything what would you be?
Tony Stark, he’s got it all – the brains, the cash and the charm.
Alice Rowan
Field: Biomedical Sciences
Role: Biological Mop
If you could be anything?
I'd be a dream, as I would be real but also surreal. There'd be no restrictions on what I wanted to do or where I wanted to go and time wouldn't simply tick away ...it could be quickened, slowed or even reversed!
Chris Earl
Field: Molecular Biology
Role: Microcystin Sensor
If you could be anything?
I would like to be an E.coli cell. Probably a pathogenic strain so I could infect people I don’t like. The main reason for this choice is so that this curse of consciousness that I have been enduring for the last 22 years will be over.
Kyle Buchan
Field: Microbiology
Role: Microbiology Specialist
If you could be anything what would you be?
I'd like to be Morgan Freeman. Because...I'd be Morgan Freeman! What's not to like?

If you could be anything what would you be?
I’d be an Elvis impersonator in Las Vegas. Uh-huh. Thank you very much. No reason.
Dr Fordyce Davidson
Field: Mathmatics
If you could be anything what would you be?
I would be me, as I have practiced at that for while now and don't mess things up as much as I used to. Being something else would mean starting again. Imagine trying to be a wasp! - complicated with all that aggression and stinging to learn...
Grant Buchanan
Field: Postdoctoral Molecular Microbiology
If you could be anything what would you be? :
Rock guitar session musician, so could enjoy the music, meeting my heroes, playing with them but without the hassle of walking down the street being recognised. Not forgetting female groupies, of course!!
Advisors
Lucia Licandro Lado
Field: PhD Molecular Microbiology
If you could be anything what would you be? A tardigrade, to be able to survive in the vaccum of outer space.
Richard Owens
Field: PhD Molecular Microbiology
If you could be anything what would you be?
A travelling, Swedish themed magician, so I could head a show called ABBAcadabra.

== 'What we did
Cas9 is an RNA-guided double-stranded DNA endonuclease, which belongs to the type II bacterial CRISPR system , from  Streptococcus pyogenes. It has two domains, RuvC and HNH, each of which cleaves one strand within the target DNA. Here we use dCas9(“dead” Cas9) ,in which mutations of D10A and H840A were introduced to abolish the endonuclease function.

Based on the published researches about CRISPR system and tandem promoters, we are trying to explore multi-stage regulation through the combination of them. We got the plasmid containing dCas9 gene from Doudna Lab freely of Addgene. We successfully express the dead Cas9(dCas9) BBa_k1081000 in standard backbone pSB1C3 and pSB1A2 in E.coli strain k12 and fused the dCas9 with omega subunit of RNA polymease. Then we donated functional dCas9 Bio-Brick ( BBa_k1081000 ) to BGI (Beijing genomics institution) 2013 iGEM team . We constructed seven tandem double promoters BBa_k1081002, BBa_k1081003, BBa_k1081004, BBa_k1081005, BBa_k1081006, BBa_k1081007 and BBa_k1081008. We constructed 7 guide RNA coding sequences and got them sequencced right. We proved the feasibility of multiple modulation.

Our Team
Hello world, we are 2013 iGEM WHU-China. We are the third team of Wuhan University attending iGEM jamboree. Of course, it is great to have a good tradition here, the senior team member lead us to this amazing field of synthetic biology and give us tremendous help either in experiment or other parts of this match. What is more important is that we combine those with our novel ideas, passion and efforts. Every time when we carry out a brain storm, when we debate for a better solution or when we do experiment throughout the whole night, fire are burning in our heart, because we know the world will be a little different, a little better by what we are doing. From December 2012, we have passed 8 months. And steps never stop, even in the Spring Festival, meeting online kept our minds together. Although we have experienced the pains of member changing, everyone who loves this team devotes what he or she can. Now it is the time for WHU-China to give you all a surprise. And it is time for us to give a answer to ourselves! Here we come.

All design and modelling work within the project was carried out by members of the team.  Implementation in the lab was also carried out wholly by members of the team, though with supervision when carrying out procedures that required the use of complicated (and expensive) equipment.
Generally team members were responsible for areas of the project as follows: -
Vincent Leonardo – Design, lab work and presentation. Vincent was responsible for maintaining our L-form bacteria throughout the project and leading characterisation of our BioBricks.  He also had a great hand in the development of our presentation, as well as designing the HBsu-xfp BioBricks.
James King – Design, modelling and presentation.  James adopted the position of one of the modellers in the team, also developing our modelling workshop.  He also had a great hand in the development of our presentation, as well as designing the HBsu-xfp BioBricks.
Yana Dem’yanenko – Modelling and lab work.  Yana spent a great deal of the project working on modelling our systems, specifically the cell shape model.  She also helped develop our modelling workshop and contributed heavily in the lab.
Matthew Law – Wiki coding, modelling and BioGame.  Matt coded the framework and templates for our wiki, as well as assisting when possible with our modelling.  He also began the development of an open source game based upon engineering a bacterium with BioBricks.
Vivian Wong – Lab work and poster.  Vivian spent a large amount of the project working in the lab, specifically investigating L-forms in plants.  She also helped a great deal with the content and production of the poster.
Christopher Wall – Design and lab work.  Christopher designed the L-form switch BioBrick that facilitates the switching on/off of the cell wall.  He also assisted with work in the lab and the production of content for the poster.
Isabelle McLaren – Lab work and presentation.  Isabelle worked for most of the project in the lab, assisting with transformations, cultures and characterisation.  She has also greatly contributed to the development of our presentation.
Robert McKiernan – Design and lab work.  Robert designed the L-form switch BioBrick that facilitates the switching on/off of the cell wall.  He also assisted with lab work and content of the poster and presentation.
Geoffrey Pettitt – Modelling and lab work.  Geoffrey divided his time in the project between modelling and lab work.  He assisted in developing our modelling workshop, as well as carrying out lab work that specifically involved L-forms in plants.
Alina Tamciuc – Graphic design, lab work and poster.  Alina created all of the graphics used in our project, from the BareCillus logo to the buttons on our homepage.  She also designed our poster and explored links between Synthetic Biology and Architecture.  Alina also assisted in the lab as much as possible.
Justas Miknys – Wiki coding and modelling.  As one of our two computer scientists Justas assisted with coding of our wiki.  He also worked on the development of our models, in particular the cell fusion model.
All team members also contributed to the content of the wiki.  All work contained in this wiki is our own unless otherwise stated.
Further Acknowledgements
What we have achieved with BareCillus wouldn't have been possible without the help of many people. We would like to extend our gratitude to:
Our supervisors for their guidance, encouragement, advice, time, wisdom and iGEM know-how.
Our advisors for their great depth of advice in a variety of areas and their guidance in the approach of our lab-work, modelling and other areas inherent to iGEM.
In particular we would like to thank the Jeff Errington Research Group at Newcastle University. They provided us with a B. subtilis strain capable of transitioning to L-form state. We sequenced and analysed parts of the genome of this strain in order to inspire the design and implementation of our very own L-form switch BioBrick.  Furthermore, it is their published research that our project has taken inspiration from – adapting the fruits of their research for the Synthetic Biology platform.
We would also like to thank Prof. Kenn Gerdes, who has a collaboration with Harvard, for providing us with the microfluidics chip we used.
And everyone else who lent a hand in the course of our project.

Title Goes Here
Students
Vincent Leonardo
Vincent is amazing, he radiates positivity and he has a black belt at being good in everything from cooking delicious food to excellent lab skills. Also, Vincent is like a ""Wikipedia of genetics"", if anyone has a question about it, he is the person who will give great advice about it. In his free time Vincent gives brilliant piano lessons, and plays it beautifully himself, also dreams of being a GREAT king in the future. Furthermore, he has an amazing 30 pairs of shoes collection, which would be enough for 3 iGEM teams! Recently, during iGEM, Vincent become proud and loving father of Betty and Bertie (the first L-forms he grew on a streak plate).
James King
If you need help modelling, James is the guy you need to talk to. James is a second year Geneticist who hopes to work in bioinformatics in the future. This chirpy chappy has a passion for cooking and has treated certain iGEMers to his delectable risotto. When not working on iGEM or cooking fabulous food you will find James at the university squash courts with friends.
Yana Dem'yanenko
A trampolining, opera-watching, guitar-and-sometimes-piano-playing, dangerous-cyclling, wine-drinking, cheese-eating, gourmet chef – Yana also sometimes works on iGEM.
Matthew Law
As one of the two computer scientists on the team, Matt has been vital to the design and production of our wiki. Matt has also cheerfully immersed himself in the labwork. Matts main computing interests are game design and bio-informatics. Outside academia, Matt enjoys playing and coaching basketball and is president of the University basketball club.
Vivian Wong
Vivian studies Pharmacology and is from Hong Kong. She’s a dedicated member of the team, often working late into the evening. As well as her competence with practical lab work, she is quietly confident in many aspects of the project such as navigating the wiki and having design input. Although first seen as a little shy, Vivian quickly came out of her shell, giving excellent advice and listening and responding to problems or concerns. In her spare time she enjoys playing the piano, eating out and enjoying a good cup of tea.
Christopher Wall
Studying in the first Synthetic Biology Masters in the country (alongside Rob), Chris completed a BSc in Biology at the University of Sheffield before moving to Newcastle.  As one of the more experienced members of the team, Chris' extensive lab skills and resourcefulness have made him the first person other members turn to when an experiment goes wrong or a protocol needs adjusting. Found in the lab at weekends and late into the night, Chris' enthusiasm and maturity have enabled him to successfully juggle iGEM with the end of his Masters project. When not in the lab, Chris can be found playing or watching football, and is also something of a movie aficionado.
Justas Miknys
Justas is one of our computer scientists in the team and provides a lot of help with the computing and modelling parts of our project. Even though he doesn’t have much background in biology, he contributed a lot in biological modelling. Justas has a signature laugh which cheers everyone up after a long day. Throughout the day, he also likes to share haribos and cookies with everyone on the team to keep everyone full. Justas suggested that our iGEM team be called Newcastle Mafia. This name was luckily voted out but he was devastated.
Alina Tamciuc
Alina is our only architect in the team but has thrown herself into the lab work with lots of enthusiasm. Her strengths are in her strong eye for design (as seen in the team logo), her straight talking attitude and supportive and friendly nature. She also enjoys hikes, cheese, wine, watching Miss Marple, cherry tea, trips to the cinema and photography.
Robert McKiernan
Rob is one of the first two people in the UK to study Synthetic Biology and prior to this he studied Cellular and Molecular Biology. He has a love of travelling, having visited 22 countries so far where he has enjoyed a wide range of experiences, from climbing to Everest base camp, to sky diving in New Zealand. He is often sighted in blur form as he skates frantically everywhere possible and he goes snowboarding whenever the chance arises. He achieved distinction in grade 8 saxophone and above all else, has a full beard!
Isabelle McLaren
Izzy is a 3rd year Biomedical Science student and is often seen helping out in the lab. She is very cheerful and lightens up the mood for everyone in the lab. Izzy is very efficient and completes tasks she is set to do quickly and accurately. When expressing her views, she is often straightforward but at the same time also listens to others member’s opinion to reach the best possible alternative while confronting a problem. While waiting for things to incubate, you can always see Izzy reading a book whilst drinking a cup of tea outside the lab. In her spare time, she also enjoys being at the beach and trying out different types of cuisine with other members of the team.
Geoffrey Pettitt
A softly spoken, contemplative chap, Geoff brings a more reflective quality to the team. his flexibility has allowed seamless movement between themes, with Geoff equally comfortable growing and experimenting on his plants or modelling the L-forms growing in them. A keen hiker, he is the vice-president of the university's fellwalking society.
Supervisors and Advisors
Prof. Anil Wipat
I am the degree programme director for the MSc Bioinformatics and Computational Systems Biology at Newcastle University.  My research interests are focussed on integrative bioinformatics, systems and synthetic biology. My group researches strategies for data integration in bioinformatics at various levels from the local integration of 'omics' datasets as probabilistic integrated functional networks, through to the integration of remote heterogeneous databases (ONDEX).  My group are investigating approaches to facilitate an integrative and systems approach to biology, with a particular emphasis on ageing and nutrition, as part of the BBSRC/EPSRC funded Newcastle Centre for the Integrative and Systems Biology of Ageing and Nutrition (CISBAN). Methods for model annotation by data integration have been developed as part of the SAINT project.   The group also researches and develops e-Science and Cloud computing technology to tackle problems in biological data analysis, simulation, and integration, and are interested in how the biological sciences can, in turn, drive developments in computing science. In particular, the group is developing technology for data integration, computational modelling and comparative genomics (e.g. Microbase).  I also researches computational design strategies for Synthetic Biology, with a focus on the role of modelling and data integration in the design of biological systems. Laboratory facilities have been estalished in collaboration with the Centre for Bacterial Cell Biology allowing computational designs to be tested in-vivo.   The biological applications of his research are quite diverse ranging from microbiology and metagenomics, through to the mechanisms of human genetic disease and ageing. Traditionally the group has a strong interest and background in microbial genomics and functional genomics particularly for Gram-positive microorganisms such as Bacillus and relatives.
Dr. Paolo Zuliani
I am a Lecturer (Assistant Professor) in the School of Computing Science at Newcastle University. My current research area is verification of biological and cyber-physical systems via model checking. I work with Anil Wipat and his group at the Center for Bacterial Cell Biology, in particular for verifying synthetic biology designs. Earlier, I worked with Edmund M. Clarke at Carnegie Mellon University, where I was the Technical Coordinator of CMACS. I am also interested in quantum and reversible programming languages, and formal methods for specifying and deriving code (a la Dijkstra) for quantum algorithms. For information visit: [http://www.ncl.ac.uk/computing/people/profile/paolo.zuliani Dr. Paolo Zuliani].
Dr. Wendy Smith
I am a research associate based in our wet lab in the Centre for Bacterial Cell Biology, Newcastle University. I studied Medical Microbiology at Newcastle University and my PhD was analysing functional genomics of group A streptococcal virulence factors.  My initial research involved investigating the mechanisms of pathogenicity utilized by the Gram positive bacteria Streptococcus pyogenes. This experience equipped me with considerable expertise in the physiology/molecular biology of Gram-positive bacteria.  I first encountered the concept of synthetic biology (at local seminars) in the context of a Gram-positive bacterium (Bacillus subtilis) and my interest stemmed initially from recognizing that this was a completely new and ‘exciting’ area, where I could make a valuable contribution exploiting my existing expertise.  I have now extended my interests into the field of synthetic biology and am specifically researching into synthetic quorum peptide mediated communication systems in Bacillus subtilis.
Dr. Jem Stach
Principal research interests include the ecology of marine actinomycetes, (diversity, abundance and biogeography), novel natural products from marine actinomycetes, the application of peptide nucleic acids in species-specific bactericide and the development of antisense-based antibacterial screens
Dr. Martyn Dade-Robertson
The trajectory of my research and teaching to date has been underpinned by a conviction that architectural design theory and practice have a significant contribution to make to contexts beyond the built environment. I have also looked to move past technological speculation in areas such as digital technology and Synthetic Biology to develop and explore experimental prototypes, seeking to ground speculative discourse in practical reality. Through the development of core research programs in technology and scientific areas such as Synthetic Biology, my aim is to develop a rigorous intellectual engagement with new types of material systems and practices.  I have published more than 20 peer reviewed publications including the book The Architecture of Information (Routledge 2011) and received more than £400,000 in research income working on projects which span architectural design and digital technologies. My research group ArchaID is the basis form both my research and teaching and more information can be found here.  I am always keen to talk to promising prospective PhD students in areas of Architectural Design and Computation and Architecture and Synthetic Biology. I have a particular interest in design and emergence through computational and biological systems.
Dr. Jennifer Hallinan
I am a researcher in the School of Computing Science at Newcastle University in the United Kingdom. I have a backgroud in both molecular biology and computing science, and am interested in the interface between the two.  I am particularly interested in the use of computational intelligence techniques to design synthetic genetic circuits. Our group has laboratory space in the Centre for Bacterial Cell Biology, where our designs can be implemented in our favourite organism, Bacillus subtilis.Research Interests include, Systems and synthetic biology,Computational intelligence and machine learning, Molecular biology of Bacillus subtilis
Owen Gilfellon
1st year PhD student, studying Computer Intelligence applied to the engineering of Bacillus subtilis, in association with Microsoft Research, Cambridge.  Current Synthetic Biology designs are generally small scale and produced manually, using large amounts of specific domain knowledge. The development of automated computational tools that utilise Computer Intelligence has the potential to extend the scale of possible designs, providing the framework for genome-scale engineering.  Work on the automated design of simple devices will be the basis for research into the full or partial automation of the full Synthetic Biology process. Important to this will be investigating the role of programming languages in defining high-level design specifications, how they can best abstract the complexity of the underlying biology, and how they can usefully incorporate computer intelligence algorithms and representations of genetic parts.
Sarah Shapiro
Hello! My name is Sarah and I am a 2nd year Ph.D student at Newcastle University. My work focuses on the gram negative Bacteroides class, which are prominent members of the human intestinal flora. I use a traditional biochemistry “bottom up” approach to elucidating how these endogenous bacteria recognise and metabolise complex carbohydrates from the intestinal environment by both characterising target proteins in vitro and through creating strains with genetic mutations. I am acting as an informal advisor to this year’s iGEM team to answer questions about general lab practice and strategies. I competed in iGEM for the University of St Andrews in 2010 and acted as an informal advisor to the subsequent year’s team. iGEM was a fantastic opportunity for me as both a competitor and advisor and it has been very rewarding for me to take part as an advisor for the Newcastle team this year.
Sungshic Park
I am a PhD student in synthetic biology. At crossroads between molecular biology and engineering, synthetic biology is a science trying to crack the code of life by building it. I want to understand how DNA governs many facets of biological life forms from microscopic regulations at the cellular level to such macroscopic phenomena as senescence, cancer, intelligence and self-awareness. I want to pursue research on building cellular machineries that can perform “simple” defined tasks. Ultimately, I want to design a framework genome that would serve as a platform for programming microbes or cellular machines.  In fact, building such a synthetic genome is a reality still far into the future. Currently, I am set out for an interim research goal: given a mathematical model of a synthetic genetic circuit, determine the what and how of in vivo measurements in terms of resolving discrepancies between the model and the world. This research calls for other enabling studies such as microfluidics, molecular quantification and directed evolution. I have background both in computing and biochemistry. I have worked on various projects involving robotics, artificial intelligence, process control, neural cell recording, animal behaviour measurement and molecular biology. Some of the species worked on include UNIX posix, Linux ubuntu, MacOS leopard, Windows seven, Rattus norvegicus (rodent), Macaca radiata (macaque), Escherichia coli, Clostridium difficile and Bacillus subtilis.
Dr. Ling Juan Wu
I am a senior research associate in the Centre for Bacterial Cell Biology, Newcastle University. I did my undergraduate and Master Degrees in China. I entered the world of bacterial chromosome segregation when I did my PhD project at Oxford University with Jeff Errington. Understanding the process of chromosome segregation and how it is coordinated with cell division in Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus subtilis remain my main research interests. Currently my work focuses on chromosome behaviour in B. subtilis L-forms and its application in synthetic biology.

Who we are?
We are students of Computer Science Faculty at Adam Mickiewicz University. We are all into Python programming, that is why last year we have started PyCircle initiative which associate python programmer and enthusiasts in Poznań and promote this programming language among local programmers in general, not only from our University. During last year we managed to make few connections with institutions that use Python in business, what enables us to learn programming from professionalists. It is the main reason why we decided to write our project in mentioned language. Our areas of interest are – among others – algorithmics, network programming, bioinformatics, molecular medicine

Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard
Zhang lab
We used the pX334a plasmid (Addgene plasmid 42333) provided by the Zhang lab (Cong et al., Science 2013). This plasmid contains a human codon-optimized Cas9 with a nickase function (humanized S. pyogenes Cas9 (D10A) nickase). This hSpCas9 is flanked by two NLS and fused N-terminally to an HA-tag. Because of the D10A mutation, hSpCas9 is only able to introduce single strand breaks. We used this hSpCas9 as a template to introduce a second mutation that removed the nickase function (H840A, Jinek et al., Science 2012) and for our standardization mutagenesis. Our registry dCas9 device contains a different promoter, HA-tag, NLS and backbone. The pX334a plasmid also includes tracrRNA and crRNA loci which we amplified for further cloning of the RNAimer plasmid.
University of Freiburg
AG Weber
The lab of AG Weber is an extremely experienced lab in the field of synthetic biology. Prof. Wilfried Weber holds the first professorship in synthetic biology in Germany. Not only was he supervising us in our project but also providing us with a lot of information and materials and we received great support from the whole group. Additionally we want to point out the support of our PI, Prof. Gerald Radziwil as well as many members of the lab:
Dr. Matias Zurbriggen for providing us with knowledge, plasmids and support.
Konrad Müller and Hannes Beyer for many plasmids, introduction to light systems and a lot of know-how.
Maximilian Hörner for providing us plasmids and discussing our project with us.
Desiree Hövermann for all the help concerning the uniBAss (binding assay).
Balder Rebmann for great input concerning the VEGF experiments.
Sabrina Wend for general advices and plasmids.
Frauke Bartels-Burgahn, Dr. Natasha Sprossmann, Susanne Knall for all the technical support.
BIOSS administration and Toolbox
BIOSS is an excellence cluster of the University of Freiburg. This institute was founded in 2008 and provides an interdisciplinary environment for as well fundamental and synthetic signaling research.
One division of this institute is the Toolbox , that provides plasmids, cell lines and antibodies for all groups associated with BIOSS.   The facility provided us with lab room, a lot of equipment, support and funding of our project. We want to thank the whole BIOSS administration and especially we would like to thank Dr. Johannes Kaiser and Kari Reulecke who provided us with a lot of support concerning legal and financial questions.
AG Timmer
The group of Prof. Dr. Jens Timmer is working on quantitative and model approaches in life sciences.
Dipl. Phys. Raphael Engesser helped us choosing the components for our system. Especially he helped us setting up and programming our model.
AG Driever
We want to thank Prof. Dr. Wolfgang Driever for discussing our project with us and Theresa Schredelseker for supporting us in questions of testing the system in vivo.
AG Ulbrich
We thank AG Ulbrich for kindly providing us cells when we were in need.
AG Eimer
We thank AG Eimer for the opportunity to use their fluorescence microscope.
Bea, Hanna and Adrian
Great thanks we owe to our advisors Bea Kaufmann, Hanna Wagner and Adrian Fischer. Besides working on their diploma or PhD thesis they always took time to help us solving problems or celebrating achievements. They joined our meetings giving wise advises and knocked us out of the skies when we had ideas that were not realistically practical. They paid attention not to influence us in the process of deciding what project to choose for iGEM.
When we had questions or problems concerning cloning strategies Bea and Hanna always suggested solutions or good tips. Adrian helped us to establish our mammalian cell culture by teaching us how to work sterile and how to handle the cells. He supported us with his protein-biochemical knowledge. Without Bea, Hanna and Adrian we would have been totally lost.
University of Stuttgart
AG Jeltsch
Prof. Albert Jeltsch from the University of Stuttgart is an expert on epigenetic modifications and supported us with know-how and plasmids concerning our epigenetic modification project. His group focusses on enzymes catalyzing epigenetic modifications. Especially we want to thank Dr. Srikanth Kuditipudhi who helped us troubleshooting our cloning strategy.

Alica Emhardt
Alica is our medicine and musician talent. She proved her great acting and singing skills in our music video “Permanently singing our CRISPR song "". You can see her delighted commitment to human practices on the pictures of the science fair in Freiburg. She is always very busy, but nevertheless she spreads good mood in the laboratory.
Alina Rudorf
Cell culture grandmaster Alina treats all our cells with that special kind of care. No matter if HEKs, CHOs or HeLas, one can always rely on her cells to be in the right density for seeding. She acquired sponsors for serological pipettes and cell culture. Due to her calm nature it’s very pleasant to work with Alina, who is always chic come hell or high water. :-P
Anne Müller
Through Anne‘s veins runs real tradeswoman‘s blood. She`s very good at gaining excellent sponsoring arrangements. Among many other things, she organized lab chairs and software licenses. In the lab she is prominent for her great cloning skills. Even in tense situations she keeps smiling and stays positive.
Fenja Gawlas
Fenja has a very open and direct personality, which makes her an ideal candidate to call things by their right names and help the team think in new ways. Additionally, she is our sponsoring and mini prep queen and organizes jamboree accommodations in every requested language. She keeps track of our expenses, but also has a creative streak when illustrating the team photos or Princess CRISPR.
Christoph Gäbelein
Christoph (“Gabi”) is not only our barbecue expert ; he also manages to work on several projects at once and still stays relaxed and easygoing. He has a high success rate at Gibson cloning and knows everything about light-inducible systems and their potential role in our project. Besides his wet lab activities, he was involved in our successful sponsoring.
Ilona Blank
Short time after Ilona joined us in the lab, our coordination increased by 200%: Suddenly and all over the lab, plans and calendars appeared. But she did not only push the efficiency of our team, she also has a talent for photography as you can see at all the pictures here! This talent appears especially, when she's capturing our lab time !
Lisa Schmunk
Lisa managed to work on several projects at the same time. She’s so committed that she will get bacteria plates out of the incubator at 2 am. Almost every project she works on is a success, not only because she works very diligently, but she has great knowledge. While it’s always nice to work with Lisa, she’s fun to hang out with, too! Besides, she gained another famous title: Lady Minigolf , Duchess of Frankfurt.
Manuel Scheidmann
If you hear a loud WOOTWOOT, Manu can´t be too far away. Always working at the front line when it comes to activation systems and partying. Besides wet lab, he was involved in our successful sponsoring. If Manu is not in the lab, you will probably find him on the beach-volleyball court. NICE!
Maximilian Stammnitz
If Max could choose his personal hero, it would probably be a mixture of Steven Spielberg, George Church, John F. Kennedy and Michael Jackson. Also called “The Robocop”, Max is our Film Director, idealist and has got fine dancing moves while wearing fancy hats. He is also committed in politics and met with local parties . His main research focus lies on KRAB-mediated gene repression with Cas9 - naming him after Mr. KRABs.
Michael Agne
Michi is the most organized and tidiest person in our team. If something has to be handled with great care, Michi is the man for it. He manages our money and is Master of Finances. During the lab work he gained another titel: Lord van Gibson (He also achieved the biggest DNA yield after gel extraction.). Without him, we would permanently run out of buffers, working stocks and competent cells. Furthermore, he turned out to be a highly gifted dancer and taught us dancing.
Nadine Gillich
Nadine is the person you should always have in mind! It was her who never caved in and at last wrestled Cas9 down to standardize it well. If you ever are in trouble with a cloning strategy or need a mutation somewhere - just ask her. Moreover, she is our ballroom queen and taught us dancing in the minutest details.
Natalie Louis
Natalie is always honest and puts her foot down, if things have to be done. She’s the one who takes care of deadlines and requirements. She’s not only a very reliable lab partner but also one of our Gibson and cloning professionals. Natalie is the shortest person in our team! Besides the lab work, you always have something to laugh with her (e.g. she named a plasmid “pIGStefanisSuper”) and she put a lot of effort into human practice .
Patrick Gonschorek
Patrick is our primer designer . He thinks as fast as lightning and it`s always a pleasure to watch this genius at work! Even at 3 o`clock in the morning he starts cloning theoretically. Furthermore, he dedicated a lot of his attention to our posters and presentation, where he makes use of his great modeling skills.
Philipp Schwenk
Wooow?! What was this?! Was it a phoenix? Was it a firebolt? No! It was Philipp Schwenk! He is the hero of the night. The ginger lantern. The protector of epigenetic histone-modification ! Philipp is a highly empathetic person, who often stands out for his mediator-skills. He helps where he can and has always worthwhile hints for you! His weakness is his bad memory for names. His greatest power: pushing the niveau to unknown depth, never seen by humans before...
Philipp Warmer
Always dressed well, he is a real gentleman and our Duke of ELISA. He managed the truncation of our Cas9. Additionally, he is a kind of mysterious wizard, who somehow involved unicorns as a central component of our project. Furthermore, he participated in the last year’s iGEM team and could give us good advice on further gene regulation tools.
Stefan Krämer
Stefan is our man for everything. He deserves the Chuck-Norris-quality seal ! It doesn’t matter if you want something organized or you need somebody to juggle pelleus balls, you should contact Stefan. Also, when you’re not sure about any cloning or lab method you can rely on his creative advises. Even programming is not a problem to him. He keeps the lab tidy while being in a good mood, you will find him singing, clanging, terribly cursing and sometimes fooling around.
Thomas Juretschke
He’s the most eloquent person in our lab and though he tends to beating around the bush. When he is speaking Spanish, you can imagine him as a real “latin lover”. Unfortunately, it’s very difficult to disturb his stoical good mood. That is especially advantageous when he comes to moderating our sessions and manages to calm down emotionally heated debates. And also his public activities are definitively worth mentioning - be it in public schools or on the streets .
Lisa Schäfer
If you have any questions concerning modeling or computers and if you have ideas for the homepage and want them to be realized, ask Lisa. She is the major IT-force of our team and will do her best in programming all the fancy and odd imaginations the team comes up with.
Advisors and Instructors
Hanna Wagner
When having questions about cloning - you should ask Hanna. Be sure, she will always have another strategy that will work with your plasmids! In performing Gibson cloning, she outstrips all of our attempts. It’s the greatest pleasure for her, when we report on successful experiments based on her advices. Furthermore, she is gifted with an extraordinary talent in painting unicorns .
Adrian Fischer
Count Adrian as an open ear for our laboratory and non-laboratory related problems. He is not only an expert in cell culture, but also a very empathetic person. He knows when it`s time to come clear and wake up the whole team. Here, his manner of speaking is worthwhile to mention. PUNKT! Next, we were always benefitting from his 24/7 attendance and would have been stranded if he hadn‘t been able to conjure some HEKs out of some unknown incubators…
Beate Kaufmann
Bea is also a former member of the iGEM team of 2010 . Thus, we always benefit from her experiences, especially when they differ from Adrian`s opinion. She is very ambitious and gives constructive suggestions.  She connected us with iGEM team TU München, so we organized a barbecue in Freiburg in August. One of her striking features: she wears sunglasses at night. Then, it’s even harder to know what she thinks!
Prof. Dr. Wilfried Weber
Wilfried Weber supports us not only with fancy ideas but also with his experimental experience and lab equipment. We were always welcome in his lab group and could always ask for help.
It was very helpful to get his appraisals, if our project ideas were practicable. And no matter what is happening you'll see him smiling... :-)
Prof. Dr. Gerald Radziwill
Gerald Radziwill is our PI. His support concerning any open questions or tasks is essential for our project. He enabled the participation of our team and always has an open ear for problems whether it concerns experimental procedures, cell culture handling or safety.
Supporters
Hannes Beyer
Hannes supported us with very helpful advice concerning experiment planning for controlling our system via light and for spatiotemporal light induction in our uniBOX. He also provided us with cells. That was especially great when we needed to expand our cell culture after the Lyon Jamboree.
Konrad Müller
Without Konrads experience in light experiments we would have had a hard time to get these systems running. With his support spatiotemporal light induction in our uniBOX finally worked.
Desiree Hövermann
Desiree was our expert for the (d)Cas9 ELISA. She helped us to develop and optimize the uniBAss and it was very helpful to discuss our project with her.
Maximilian Hörner
Maximilian supported us in concerns of hormone induced nuclear localization of our Cas9 and helped us in discussions over our project.
Patrick Schindler
Patrick is the quiet giant, who always reminds us to consider certain aspects from a different angle. Due to his deep voice, his advices are even given more importance. Our team benefits from his experience as he also participated in iGEM 2010 . Furthermore, he is known for organizing big board game parties!
Mascot
Princess CRISPR
From uniCAS to uniCORN... We cannot exactly determine when Princess CRISPR joined our team, but since then our scientific work has become more majestic and magical.

Meet the team!
Kong Khai Jien
PhD student in Application of Synthetic Biology to T Cell Engineering at UCL Cancer Institute. Previously did BSc Biotechnology.
Why iGEM:
I enjoy the fun of programming genetics and the associated vibrant community. My brain is constantly stimulated by thinking about the possibilities of what we can play with. Carrying out an idea as a team, interacting with other teams, thinking about the different techniques and discovering new knowledge, it is so great to be part of it!
Cassandra Stowe
I have an undergraduate degree in Human Biology from the University of Birmingham and a masters in Cancer from UCL. I have just started my PhD at the UCL Cancer Institute, in conjunction with the UCL Centre for Advanced Biomedical Imaging, creating optical genetic reporters.
Why iGEM:
I wanted to do iGEM because I thought it would be a great experience that would enable me to apply my science background to a new challenge.
Ranvir Chaudhri
Student at UCL studying a masters in Biochemical Engineering. Previously did an undergraduate degree in Honours Biochemistry.
Why iGEM:
Because synthetic biology is awesome. The beauty and sheer multitude of nature is so amazing my mind is constantly being blown. So many materials and systems exist in biology and the human race is just beginning to mimic them. I'm doing my part to make it happen.
Thomas Stahl
I am a second year PhD student at UCLs Department of Medical Physics and Bioengineering, developing Contrast Agents for the use in Medical Imaging, especially Photoacoustic Imaging. Before this I did MRes at UCL, producing a setup for Photoacoustic spectroscopic measurements.
Why iGEM:
I believe public engagement is a great challenge for cutting edge research. iGEM has drawn wide public attention towards Biological Engineering and its impact and promotes public discussions, which is a great achievement. Working together with a great team, I urged to take the opportunity to contribute to and be part of iGEM 2013.
Hugh Jarman
Student at UCL studying a masters in Biochemical Engineering. Previously did an undergraduate degree in Biotechnology and Management at Imperial College London.
Why iGEM:
I've always wanted to do iGEM. I missed out on it during my undergraduate degree and when I saw that the postgraduate team is being introduced I thought it was an excellent opportunity. I was drawn to iGEM in the first place due to the chance to apply my knowledge and skills learnt at university to do some cool science.
Shahin Heshmatifar
Student at UCL studying a MSc in Biochemical Engineering. Previously studied an undergraduate degree in Biomedical Sciences at University of Westminster.

Prof. PVM Rao:
Prof. Rao of the Mechanical Engineering department at IIT Delhi is the coordinator of the innovation centre of IIT which was responsible for providing us funds to do our project. He has been a driving force when it came to helping our team with funding. His ever optimistic attitude and love for science have been a great motivating factor for our team.
Prof. James Gomes:
Prof. James Gomes of the Kusuma School of Biological Sciences, IIT Delhi was a great help to us when it came to modeling our system. His effervescent nature, ensured that the discussions with him were always fun and super interesting. While modeling our system, we inadvertently ended up learning a lot about systems biology from him.
CSS Pavan:
An iGEM veteran, he was an integral part of the first eve iGEM team from IIT Delhi (iGEM  2010). He has been our team’s sensei, guiding us every time we faced problems. Our very own Yoda, he helped us in conceptualizing our project. He’s a wise man who’s going to the Weizmann Institute of science as a research scholar. We wish him all the very best in his future endeavours.

About Us
The Lethbridge Entrepreneurial iGEM team members have vast experience in previous iGEM competitions. In this last year alone, Isaac Ward, Erin Kelly and Mackenzie Coatham acted as advisors for the Lethbridge High School iGEM team. The High School team engineered E. coli to produce the peptide hormone Oxytocin and its precursor protein.          They were extremely successful, winning Best New Biobrick - Natural, Best Wiki and the First Place Green Brick at the High School Jamboree.
Harland Brandon is an advisor to the Lethbridge Collegiate iGEM team, who have also been quite successful this year. At the North American Regional Jamboree in Toronto, Lethbridge Collegiate won Best Wiki and First Place in the overgraduate division.
All members also have experience in research labs outside of iGEM, in both neuroscience and biochemistry labs.

In addition, she displays excellent application skills mixed with a creative mind and a sense of dedication.  Experience with teaching and leadership in a team environment make Mackenzie a perfect fit for being one of the two chief science officers.
Harland Brandon B.Sc. – coCSO of Synbiologica
Harland brings a creative attitude to development and problem solving, along with a strong backing in biochemistry and molecular biology. Having participated in the iGEM competition for the past 3 years along with working in a research lab at the university during his undergrad he has developed skills for researching, troubleshooting, and multitasking in laboratory work.
Amrinder Grewal
Amrinder is a high school student in Grade 12 taking the IB diploma programme. His previous experience with biochemistry was with Lethbridge High School iGEM. In High School iGEM, he was primarily involved with designing the wiki, but did perform some lab work.  This time in iGEM, he is involved with wiki design. In his free time, he likes to explore new concepts in web design, web development and programming.
Dr. Gerlinde Metz
Dr. Gerlinde Metz investigates the influence of experience and environment on behaviour and brain plasticity. Her work was the first to show that stress affects motor system function and diseases of the motor system, such as Parkinson’s disease and stroke. This research indicated that adverse experience at any time in life can become a predisposing or precipitating factor of disease. More recently, her laboratory has developed a rat model of transgenerational prenatal stress. This model allows the study of transgenerational inheritance of health and disease and epigenetic linkages from early development to old age. Her contribution to Synbiologica will include work in animal models of disease and physiological manipulations and assays, and related behavioural studies.
Dr. Hans- Joachim Wieden
Dr. Hans-Joachim Wieden is an Associate Professor of Physical Biochemistry at the University of Lethbridge and an Alberta Ingenuity Faculty member. He received his Ph.D from the University of Witten/Herdecke, Germany.  Dr. Wieden is an integrated member of the Alberta RNA Research and Training Institute, and a Canada Research Chair (TIER2) in Physical Biochemistry.  He Is actively engaged in and over see’s the University of Lethbridge iGEM team and the Lethbridge High School iGEM team.  His background in Synthetic biology and physical biochemistry brings molecular insight into the inner workings of BEAR.
Dr. Roy Golsteyn
Dr. Roy Golsteyn is an Associate Professor of Biology at the University of Lethbridge and a member of the Alberta Ingenuity Faculty.  He earned his PhD in Biochemistry at the University of Cambridge, England and continued his studies in cancer biology at the Institute Curie in Paris. Prior to joining the University of Lethbridge in 2007, he directed a drug discovery laboratory in Oncology in the pharmaceutical company, Servier, Paris (22,000 employees, $3 billion annual revenue).  Today, he directs the Cancer Cell Laboratory where his team studies how cancer cells survive chemotherapy, and continues to work with the biotechnology industry. He has over 70 research publications and holds 4 patents.  He strongly supports science as a board member (Technology/Research) for Economic Development Lethbridge and sits on the National and Local Committees of the Canada Wide Science Fair 2013.
Mr. Michael Kelly
Mr. Michael Kelly is the Manager of Real Estate and Land Development for the City of Lethbridge.

Suneet Kharey
Hello, my name is Suneet (sun-eat). This is my first year in iGEM, I've always been intrigued by synthetic biology so I'm grateful for this opportunity. In my free time (which is currently non-existent) I enjoy learning new languages (currently at 3), painting, buying more Doc Martens, and pointing out obscure constellations in the night sky. Currently I am learning French and teaching myself how to play the Harmonica.
Graeme Glaister
I am a fourth year B.Sc. Neuroscience student, planning on pursuing a Master’s degree. This is my first year in iGEM. I grew up in Fort McMurray but moved to Lethbridge in Jr. High. The reason I chose to participate in iGEM is so that I could have the unique experience (for an undergrad) of participating in the planning process for an experiment as well as the necessary lab work. I eagerly look forward to continuing on with iGEM in 2014.
Zak Stinson
Hey, I'm Zak, and I am an iGEMmer. I thought I was almost free of my fascination with genetic technologies when I transferred to the neuroscience program at the U of L in 2011 from biology at the U of R, but I lapsed right back when I learned that iGEM existed. I thought I had refocused when I began doing behavioural experiments with rats, but immediately searched out and executed a synthetic biology project designing a system for reporting gene activity in the brains of live animals. After completing my B.Sc. in neuroscience this summer I will likely continue to design synthetic biology projects in the M.Sc. neuroscience program at the U of L as I am dangerously hooked. So I guess I'll talk to you all next year!
Dustin Smith
Hello, my name is Dustin Smith. I was born and raised in Lethbridge, and I am now a Master’s student majoring in Biochemistry. I’m happy to be back with the University of Lethbridge iGEM team for a third year, and as always it has been a great experience. Outside of school my favorite activities are ice hockey, snowboarding, and lifting.
Jenna Friedt
Hello, my name is Jenna and I am one of the graduate student advisors for the 2013 Lethbridge iGEM team. Since I’m convinced I was born in the wrong era, I’m currently looking for assistance in inventing a time machine to send me back to the ‘50s, where I would happily fit in with the bubblegum rockers and poodle skirt-wearing youth of the day. Until that happens, I’ll settle for nights on the patio listening to the Beatles, reading a good book, and watching Audrey Hepburn movies.
Harland Brandon
Harland is an avid biochemist pursuing his Masters degree. In his spare time he enjoys building and creating new things, as such it was only natural that he continued with his interest in iGEM. Having been around the competition for four years now he has decided to take a backseat role in guiding and mentoring the schools iGEM team. When you don't find him in lab or at the university he can most likely be found at his computer playing or enjoying a fine strong Scottish beverage.
Supervisor: Hans-Joachim Wieden
Originally from Germany I moved to Canada in 2005 to start a research group on the structure and function of the bacterial protein synthesis machinery, a cellular process targeted by over 50% of the known antibiotics. I am intrigued by the molecular design and function of this essential bio-nanomachine. I try to unravel the underlying design principles in order to enable the rational design and engineering of novel bio-nanomachines. I am essentially asking the question if such novel bio-machines can be constructed from simple and fundamental principles or are these assemblies just too complex. Well and that’s why it was extremely easy to rope me into doing iGEM.

The Team.
Objectives
The project will focus on the development of a specific water biosensor , but with a modular and scalable approach. Thereby you could easily afford multiple measurements with the very same device.
The device will be designed in a way that its collected data will be easily accessible via a web interface, and later it could be transferred to the relevant agencies upon request.
At the end of this project we expect to have a prototype of measuring device and a diagram of a system for the distribution, collection and centralization of data.
The project will aim on the measurement of a primary pollutant: arsenic . However, its modular and scalable design provides an easy way to incorporate various contaminants already identified, such as nitrate / nitrite, lead and hydrocarbons.
With the data collected is expected that any user with minimal training (using an image-based Instruction given) could easily and quickly determine the presence and level of the contaminant on his water. Also with the systematic use of this tool by the enforcement authorities, specific public policies could be implemented based on current and reliable information.
Motivation
Limited access to clean water is a deep problem and tends to worsen with time. The pollution that converts water in non-drinkable can vary from just a single toxic (eg arsenic) to a highly complex mixture of types of substances such as those found in various river basins (eg Sali-Dulce, Matanza-Riachuelo among others).
Depending on the type of contamination (complexity and abundance),  making  the water to be drinkable could be easy and inexpensive. Even if it weren't possible to make it drinkable, information on pollutant levels could be easily used to modify consumption patterns and seek alternative sources of water.
At present, the spatial and temporal quantification of contaminants is limited by the difficulty in processing the samples and associated costs. Moreover, the lack of centralization and systematization of data does the task of obtain them by decision makers, stakeholders and the general public, very difficult.

I love science since I was a child. Although I always knew  that I was going to study natural science, I wasn´t so sure about the election of my carreer. Fortunately at the end of the high school the answer came to me. I participated in the biology olympiads and then I realised that I would be happy studying biology. I've decided to participate in IGEM because it's a great way of learning new things. It's great because you learn in group: with the other guys and from the other guys. But science is not my only one love, i must confess that I have a romance with music. I've been singing in choirs since I was very young and I hope to do it for the rest of my life.

Santiago Sosa - Biology Student
Si bien la biología es el área de la ciencia que mas me gusta, en general disfruto de aprender cosas nuevas cualquiera sea la temática. Decidí participar de IGEM porque creo que es un proyecto del que se puede aprender mucho. Ademas es una gran oportunidad para aprender a trabajar en grupo. Cuando me enteré de la temática que íbamos a tratar en nuestro proyecto, me entusiasmó mucho la idea de que ademas de poder participar en una competencia podríamos hacer algo útil a nuestra sociedad. En mi tiempo libre disfruto de cantar y practicar trapecio. Son dos actividades que me ayudan a relajarme y a expresarme en el ámbito artístico.
Inés Patop- Biology Student
En mi vida cotidiana me dedico a muchas cosas. Estudio bología en la Universidad de Buenos Aires, pero también estudio, desde que tengo memoria, música, pintura y fotografía. También me interesa la divulgación cinetífica, la pedagogía y la antropología. Cuando escuché de iGem y de la biología sintética me fascinó la idea de combinar biología y diseño, la idea más ""ingenieril"" del asunto y a su vez la posibilidad de accionar más directamente sobre nuestra realidad cotidiana.
Francisco Dorr- Computer Science Student
Soy un estudiante de Ciencias de la Computación de 23 años, pero siempre tuve interés por la biología. De hecho, comencé a cursar la carrera de Bioinformática, pero decidí volver a mis orígenes y continuar con la computación. Participar en iGEM es lo que le estaba faltando a mi estudio, ya que puedo aplicar mis conocimientos aprendidos y aportar una visión desde fuera de las ciencias biologícas. Además, la posibilidad de trabajar con un grupo proveniente de diferentes ámbitos creo que es una experiencia totalmente enriquecedora. El hecho de que la biología sintética abarque un espectro tan amplio es una de las cosas que más me gustan, ya que la única frontera es la imaginación que cada uno pueda tener! Y poder ayudar (en este caso de una forma ecológica) haciendo lo que a uno le gusta es una gran satisfacción. Ahora un poco de mi fuera de la vida universitaria: toco el piano y la guitarra, me gusta salir a correr todas las semanas, y sobre todo, compartir alguna comilona con amigos.
Luciano Marasco- Biology Student
Estudiante de Biología, colaborador en investigación en Biología Molecular, Botánico apasionado, orador en TED, nerd part-time, todólogo, bebedor empedernido de jugo de naranja, por las noches sale a combatir las caries.
Lucas Vattino- Biology Student
Soy estudiante de la carrera de Ciencias Biológicas, en la UBA. Estoy cursando mi último año y mi orientación es a la neurobiología. Me interesó participar en la competencia iGEM porque creo que la biología sintética es un interesante desafío científico, donde se ponen a prueba distintos aspectos necesarios para la vida de los que nos queremos dedicar a la ciencia, como por ejemplo la creatividad, la perseverancia y la capacidad de desarrollar un trabajo interdisciplinario y grupal. Más allá del desafío intelectual que me resulta atractivo de iGEM, creo que la biología sintética tiene un gran potencial, y que a partir de ella se pueden lograr grandes resultados que excedan el campo del conocimiento, para llegar a la sociedad.
Sebastián Mildiner- Biology Student
Tengo 22 y estudio biología en la UBA. De chico mis pasiones eran armar cosas con lego y hacer experimentos mezclando todo lo que hubiera en la casa (además de los power rangers, claro). Hice la secundaria en un colegio comercial y me olvidé un poco de todo eso, pero por alguna razón me anoté en esta carrera y me fui reencontrando con ese yo de mi infancia y todos esos recuerdos y sensaciones que tenía recluidas en algún lugar de la memoria. Hace algunos años me hubiera resultado imposible imaginar que hoy en día iba a estar pensando proyectos de lego otra vez, pero con partes biológicas reales y con gente tan copada con tanto para aportar. Por fuera de lo académico, me gusta leer literatura, ver películas, andar en bicicleta, muy de vez en cuando remar y jugar al futbol con amigos, actividad en la que me destaco por mi falta de habilidad.
Federico Vignale- Biology Student
Soy estudiante de segundo año de la licenciatura en Ciencias Biológicas de la Universidad de Buenos Aires. Desde que escuché sobre la existencia de la biología sintética, me quedé fascinado sobre esta nueva disciplina que tiene mucho futuro y que puede mejorar la calidad de vida humana. Es por eso que decidí formar parte del equipo IGem Buenos Aires 2013, el cual me va a permitir acercarme más a la biología sintética y obtener experiencia en la misma.  bicicleta, muy de vez en cuando remar y jugar al futbol con amigos, actividad en la que me destaco por mi falta de habilidad.
Federico Barone- Physics Student
Soy estudiante de física y en mi carrera existe una clara división entre ciencia teórica y aplicada. Yo siempre me incline más hacia esta última y vi en la propuesta de IGEM Buenos Aires 2013 la posibilidad de aprender y desarrollarme en un proyecto interdisciplinario y desafiante, con el fin concreto de brindarle a la población una herramienta que pueda mejorar su calidad de vida. Como yapa no me acordaba que la biología era así de interesante y de la mano de mis compañeros me estoy metiendo de a poco en un mundo nuevo que cada vez me resulta más interesante.

Grad Students
Charlie Cooper
Charlie Cooper is a graduate student in the Buchler lab developing tools to control biological processes.
Instructors
Nicolas Buchler, Ph. D.
Website: Buchler Lab
The Buchler Lab is interested in the systems biology and evolution of epigenetic switches (bistability) and clocks (oscillators) in gene regulatory networks, two functions that are essential for proper patterning, cell proliferation, and cellular differentiation in biological systems. We use several approaches (experiment and theory, biology and physics, evolutionary systems biology and synthetic biology) to understand the diverse molecular and evolutionary mechanisms by which combinatorial control, ultrasensitive thresholds, bistability, and oscillation have evolved in gene networks.
Charles A. Gersbach, Ph. D.
Website: Gersbach Lab
The Gersbach Lab is focused on engineering new methods for directing cell behavior to regenerate diseased or damaged tissues and treat genetic diseases.  We are particularly interested in developing and applying technologies that manipulate cellular processes at the genetic level.  Our work capitalizes on the products of the Genomic Revolution and modern advances in the fields of genetic reprogramming, gene delivery, protein engineering, stem cell transplantation, and synthetic  biology to create innovative biologic approaches to improving human health.  These studies also facilitate a better understanding of complex processes including organogenesis, cell lineage determination, and gene regulation that will ultimately lead to improved design of drugs and biotherapeutics.  Our efforts are catalyzed by interdisciplinary collaborations with investigators in engineering and medicine at Duke and other institutions.

Our team
We are proud to present You, our team with our dinosaur!!! This is the mascot of our Faculty of Biology . As you can see he is on vacation, surfing in our halls in the night, when no one can see him...
Most of our students are studying biotechnology in our University, but we also have people with Computer Science background that decided to take the challenge and start their adventure in iGEM competition from the perspective of the wet lab, which is a completely new experience for them !!!
Our group is divided into two different laboratories, one is situated in the Department of Molecular Biology and our second laboratory is situated in the Institute of Genetics and Biotechnology .
STUDENTS
Aleksandra Bartosik
I am studying biotechnology and chemistry at the College of Inter-faculty Individual Studies in Mathematics and Natural Science . I'm fascinated by biomimicry and bioengineering, because  we are surrounded with plenty of awe-inspiring technologies almost ready to use.
My other passion is journalism, learning languages and traveling. In my free time I dive, preferably somewhere in Northern Europe, talk about graphics with my best friend and wonder why the world works the way it does...
This is my first  iGEM competition, so everything is exciting and I can't wait for the Jamboree. In our iGEM Warsaw Team I take care of the Human Practice part of the project and work in the Cell Lab.
Filip Hoffmann
I am a student of Biotechnology at the Faculty of Biology , I also study Neuroinformatics at the Faculty of Physics in our university. My area of interests are genetics of bacteria, and brain - computer interfaces. Privately I am an avid sailor and an amateur football journalist. I also own two lovely cockatiels, Athen and Tyrion.
Elżbieta Jankowska
I'm a final year student of Biotechnology, which means I'm currently working on my Masters thesis. Hopefully it will be finished soon. My area of scientific interest includes ancient DNA, molecular phylogenetics, synthetic biology (of course:p) and anything I find interesting at the moment. Apart from that I like traveling, singing and sci-fi & fantasy.
Ewelina Kośmider
Primarily I'd started studying Biotechnology at the Faculty of Biology but after one year I moved to the College of Inter-faculty Individual Studies in Mathematics and Natural Science . In my future I want to be connected with either life science or computer science. The area of my interest is pretty wide: starting from computer security and molecular biology through Chinese and ending up with dancing with fire.
Anna Kotrys
I am a sophomore student of biotechnology at the University of Warsaw .  The area of my scientific interest focuses on alternative splicing and RNA metabolism. What I am also interested in, are molecular mechanisms of cancerogenesis. In 2013 iGEM project I am responsible for the cytotoxicity study in the cell biology part. In the future I would like to follow a scientific pathway which I assume would lead me to a phD in molecular biology.  Apart from biology, I am keen on fencing and tennis and I do love the arts.
Anna Miścicka
I am studing biotechnology at the Faculty of Biology of the University of Warsaw . This year I did my Bachelor thesis in the Department of Molecular Biology , so next year I'll start Master thesis, also in the Department of Molecular Biology .
I have an artistic nature. I love drawing and singing. I am a soprano in Faculty's Choir since January 2012. In free time I am watching animated films (Disney, Pixar, DreamWorks and this stuff) - I am partial to polish dubbing.
I think if I didn't chose science, I would be a grafic artist, singer or voice actress.
Aleksandra Olszewska
I am a student of graphic design at the Academy of Fine Arts in Warsaw. I try to make the work of IGEM Warsaw team more attractive to your eyes...
Dorota Kaja Sabat
I am studying biology and psychology at the College of Inter-faculty Individual Studies in Mathematics and Natural Science . So far I was researching mutations in POLG1 human gene, but this year I am beginning my adventure with embryology. Aside from science, I like traveling and taking photographs. I am also enthusiastic rock climber :)
Anna Saffray
I am a first year student at the Faculty of Biology of our university and I am studying biotechnology.
I enjoy spending time in the laboratory learning new exciting approaches, methods and facts, that is why I am trying different projects. I have met the World of: plants, bacteria, yeasts, as well as the World of cells, I don't know yet what to choose but I guess at one point I will just know.
I can't wait to go to the IGEM conference and hear about new ideas and projects of other students that are going to be present, it is always a great opportunity to talk with people that share the same passion for science.
Apart from my first hobby (science) I enjoy listening to classical music,  especially Sergei Rachmaninoff and play the piano.
When I get away from the crowd in Warsaw I enjoy the wonder of Natural Horsemanship . Spending time with my horses taught me that all I need to do is: be present, listen, observe and everything will be alright...
Katarzyna Sitarz
I am studying biotechnology at the Faculty of Biology . I am fascinated by biology since middle school. My main subjects of interest are: Genetics, virology, and carcinogenesis. I have so many ideas about my future as a scientist that I have no idea with which area of biology  I will spend my time on... Apart science I am interested in politics, feminism and recently I became also interested in  fun facts about the subway... I am  befriended with a cat named Richard...
Róża Węglińska
I am studying biotechnology and psychology at the College of Inter-faculty Individual Studies in Mathematics and Natural Science . I am  particularly interested  in genetics, molecular biology and proteomics, as well as neurobiology and neurogenetics. This year I did my Bachelor thesis in the Institute of Genetics and Biotechnology in the Laboratory of RNA Biology and Functional Genomics . Next year I'll start Master thesis, also in this lab, carrying out a project related to the study of protein interactions connected to CCR4-NOT complex in Homo sapiens. Since May 2011 I am the head of the Student Genetics and Epigenetics Society at the University of Warsaw . I'm fascinated by learning and teaching, dealing with new teaching developments in early childhood education. Besides, I like traveling, reading books, playing board games and singing (I am a soprano at the Faculty of Biology Choir since October 2010). I am also collecting postcards and tea from all around the world...
Kamil Żmijewski
I am a student of the International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme at the Stefan Batory High School in Warsaw. In the project, I am working in the cell biology section, taking part in the measurements of cytotoxicity of acrylamide in eukaryotic cell lines.  The work in the laboratory is an engaging and rewarding experience, which is complemented by excellent supervision and cooperation. Apart from a strong interest in science and health-related issues, I am also interested in photography and semantics. I wish to continue education in medicine or a related area leading to clinical practice and non-clinical medical research.
ADVISORS
Kamil Koziara
I am studying Computer Science and Biotechnology at the University of Warsaw , but that's just on paper. In reality I am trying to get more holistic view of the world which basically means running around hectically, learning random stuff to answer intriguing me questions to get even more questions. It's a vicious circle, but it's really fun to do so.
Recently I am joining the hype over the big data and bioinformatics. I am fascinated by bioengineering and its applications. I love to read. From time to time I torture myself with some philosophical concepts. When I am too tired to think I go for a swim. \(^-^)/
Anna Misiukiewicz
I am a graduate of Biotechnology at the University of Warsaw with a specialization in microbiology. The end of my studies couldn’t hold me back from continuing my adventure with science, that’s why I’m a Warsaw Team member. Now I’m mainly focused on the field of my employment – a quality control in pharmaceutical production which I find very interesting and quite different from anything I've done so far. I still can’t imagine my life without a cup of black tea, weather forecast and visiting my hometown – Białystok . As often as possible I spend my free time with my great hobbies - psychology and analogue photography.
Mikołaj Ogrodnik
I have finished my master studies at the Faculty of Biology this year and from October on I will continue as a PhD student. I am highly interested in cellular biology, mostly in processes concerning ageing and senescence.  I believe that the better understanding of ageing process could provide the means to better treat age-related diseases and even to extend human lifespan.
I like also botany, molecular biology and bioinformatics. I enjoy traveling and doing small (or sometimes bigger) scientific projects all around the world. Outside the lab I am spending my time on long strolls, reading books and rock climbing.
Krzysztof Szczepaniak
I have graduated from the University of Warsaw and now I'm beginning my PhD studies at the International Institute of Molecular and Cell Biology in Warsaw . Beside biology, I like computer programming and I try to develop my skills in this field. Outside the lab I am a scout leader, I am interested in foreign languages, astronomy and I love everything connected with science-fiction and fantasy.
Antoni Rościszewski
I am an undergraduate bioinformatics student at the University of Warsaw ( Faculty of Mathematics, Informatics and Mechanics . I'm particularly interested in systems biology and bioinformatics applications in synthetic biology, as well as personal genomics.
Marcin Ziemniak
I have graduated from the University of Warsaw (M.S in bioorganic chemistry and B.S in molecular biology). Currently, I am a PhD student at the Faculty of Physics, University of Warsaw . The scientific project in which I am involved is interdisciplinary, hence in my research I employ not only chemical synthesis of modified nucleotides but also a variety of biochemical and biophysical techniques. I am also quite interested in structural biology and nanotechnology. Apart from academia I enjoy travelling, taking photos and sport. I am also an avid fan of science fiction and fantasy.

Human Practice
Our IGEM team contrived and participated in the seminar about “ the Life of Arsenic(As) group"" at the end of 2012.  In that seminar, we discussed a paper, "" A Bacterium that Can Grow by Using Arsenic instead of Phosphorus"", which talked about the relationship between As and lives on the earth. According to that paper, As may have potential ability to take place of phosphorus to comprise lives. The paper indeed gave some plausible reasons on the problem, though, we found that there were a few leaks in the author's conclusion because the experiment conducted by the author was unrepeatable and the results were not well-founded. Most importantly, there were a few papers undermining that paper. Of course, we didn't conduct experiments to testify hypothesis proposed by us. Consequently, we also can't draw a decisive conclusion. But through this seminar we learned that a good experimental design should be not only feasible but also reliable and repeatable.
At the beginning of 2013, we prepared a symposium about genetics. We aimed at making our new members familiar with the fundamental knowledge of genetics and broadening our horizons at the same time.
During this symposium, we discussed about the Mendel' laws. At first, we recollected the ""First and Second Laws"" of Mendel, then we elaborated the ""Linkage Law"" in detail. At the symposium we answered a few questions asked by new members and simultaneously, we had a more profound impression on genetics. In the end, we explained some common features and cognitive sites of restriction enzyme to make a preparation for our next experiment as a complement content. 
Besides, to enrich and broaden our kens we held some similar symposium about transgenic, signaling pathways, reparation of plant root and so on.

Team Members
This year, our team Tokyo Tech consists of various members. We have sophomore, junior and senior students, and also have a member from another University. We spent the whole fantastic summer holiday to prepare for this competition. We have been experimenting and discussing from early mornings to late nights every day, and shared the roles within a limited time to attain our goal. Although we experienced numerous difficulties in carrying out the project, we had very fulfilling days. Here, we would like to introduce our team members.

Overview
A love story contains several processes. Two people fall in love and their love burning wildly. However, no forever exists in the world, in most occasions, love will eventually burn to only a pile of ashes of the last remaining wind drift away. In our project, we have recreated the story of ""Romeo and Juliet"" by Shakespeare vividly by two kinds of Escherichia coli cell-cell communication. We aim to generate a circuit involving regulatory mechanism of positive feedback rather than commonly-used negative feedback to control the fate of E.coli by signaling between two types of E.coli. Besides, Rose represents love. We are the first iGEM group ever to synthesize P(3HB) (a kind of bio-plastics) by using our new biobrick part, representing rose .     Ⅰ cell-cell communication     ""Romeo and Juliet"" is the drama by dramatist William Shakespeare of England. The stage is city Verona, Italy in the 14th century. Romeo met Juliet. Two people fell in love instantly. In this project, we will recreate the love story of ""Romeo and Juliet"".

Project Background
In this iGEM Competition, we intended to tell the public about the development of synthetic biology, especially about the network programming, as well as we enjoyed our activity for iGEM. Tokyo Tech 2013 assisted with an experiment workshop for high school students, participated in a poster session and collected feedback from public people as human practice (Fig. 1-1-1). We learned that an interesting story is an easier way to make general people  understand the importance of genetic programming in synthetic biology.  To respond further to the feedback that we received, we also address a farming issue. Thus, we designed a story which contains a farming issue and a state switching circuit in E. coli, the life of ninja: battle and farming.
(Go to Human Practice page)
[Fig. 1-1-1. Poster session]
Yellow labels and blue labels are sticked on our posters.
[Fig. 1-1-2. Ninja vs. Samurai in Tokyo Tech]
Story
Ninja is a Japan's ancient spy-warrior. Ninja usually mimics an ordinary civilian. Once he detects samurai who is the target of assassination, he immediately gets ready for battle. He attacks samurai by throwing so-called ""ninja stars"". These weapons are called ""shuriken"" in Japanese (Fig. 1-1-2).
Click a step shown below to know what happens in our circuit!
Project Overview
In our programming of artificial genetic circuit, E. ninja heads casts. In response to E. civilian signal or E. samurai signal, E. ninja changes its state: ""Mimic state"" or ""Attack state"". The circuit of E. ninja contains a bi-stable switch part and a signal dependent switching part. We decided to use 3OC6HSL and 3OC12HSL as the signals. The crosstalk between these two signals is well known as a significant problem in synthetic biology. To realize an accurate switching, we designed a circuit which achieved the circumvention of crosstalk that occurs in bacterial cell-cell communication system (Fig. 1-1-4).
(Go to State Switching page)
[Fig. 1-1-3. The result of our wet experiment for the circumvention of the crosstalk]
The level of GFP expression in cells, when TetR is active, was clearly lower than that when TetR is inhibited. Even with activated LasR, lux/tet hybrid promoter ( BBa_K1139110 ) was repressed by TetR precisely. This result showed that our network including TetR can circumvent crosstalk by the activated LasR.
[Fig. 1-1-4. Our designed circuit for the circumvention of crosstalk]
We designed the circumvention of crosstalk by network engineering.
Our wet experiment results showed that the combination of lux/tet hybrid promoter and TetR protein circumvented the crosstalk by preventing the LasR protein from acting on LuxR-binding sequences (Fig. 1-1-3). Our mathematical model based on these results showed the circumvention of crosstalk in the circuit including toggle switch and crosstalk circumvention system(Fig. 1-1-5).
(Go to Modeling page)
[Fig. 1-1-5. Our mathematical model for the circuit of E. ninja]
The solid/dotted lines stand for the case with/without the crosstalk circumvention. The expression of LacI is repressed through the crosstalk circumvention.
[Fig. 1-1-6. Our new part for inducible phage release]
We designed a new part for inducible phage release. Varoius promoters are allowed to be inserted upstream of g2p to regulate the phage release.
[Fig. 1-1-7. Distribution of plaques and analysis]
We analyzed the distribution of the plaques by using ImageJ.
In addition, E. ninja releases M13 phage, which corresponds to shuriken, when E. ninja receives E. samurai signal. The inducible phage release will open a new way in synthetic biology by achieving the programmed DNA messaging (Fig. 1-1-6).
(Go to Shuriken page)
In the second-life story, E. ninja starts farming in a peaceful village.  He can increase plant growth by synthesizing several plant hormones depending on the soil environment.  We constructed an improved phosphate sensor (phoA promoter, BBa_K1139201 ). Also, we learned methods for quantitative analysis for cytokinin, one of the plant hormones, through a bioassay of cucumber seed sprouts (Fig. 1-1-8). Towards further consideration of farming with microbes, we also continued the human practice investigation through some interviews with science foundations and organizations (Fig. 1-1-8).
(Go to Farming page)
Future Works
[Fig. 1-1-8. Our bioassay of cucumber seed sprouts]
We cultivated the sprouts in standard cytokinin sample solutions and then measured the weights of the sprouts and the concentrations of chlorophyll.
We believe that our project can contribute to various fields. First, our crosstalk circumvention system gives more flexibility to design genetic circuits. By adding only a few genes, you can circumvent crosstalk of AHL. Second, our inducible phage release system can make DNA messaging more complex and more diverse. Moreover, for bioremediation, we can search for new M13 phage hosts by using our designed M13 phage. Finally, our farming project is expected to act as a pioneering trail toward new approaches in farming. Especially, our strategy to produce plant hormones in temporal patterns in E. coli can be applied to studying the plants' response to external plant hormones. We hope to contribute to spreading the importance and the great possibilities of synthetic biology through the public.

Graduate in Molecular Sciences - CCM/USP
Chico is someone who started as a wannabe physicist. Being driven by the idea of turning empirical knowledge into something quantifiable, testable and reproducible, he became increasingly interested in doing that to biology—and that brought him to system and synthetic byology.
He is particularly interested in bridging the gap between mathematical theory  and practical knowledge, and sees the iGEM competition as one of the coolest situations to do that.

Raquel is a college student fascinated by biology and presents a very ecletic taste in this area: loves molecular biology; has a crush on anthropology, with focus on human evolution; has a love-hate relationship with botanical illustration and the taste for synthetic biology came to mess up those relationships even more =)
What she likes most in synthetic biology is the fact that different areas are interspersed and complement each other in a form so spectacular and unique and the iGEM is a cool competition that proves it.
Loves to read any kind of book, loves music, from rock to the classics and would be nothing without the support of her family (huge by the way) which is a key part in her life.

Cleandho is a Biology student at USP, who aims to harmonize both his scientific and human aspects. He is a very curious person, with deep interest in whatever is done with passion—be it a laboratory experiment, an astronomical observation or even just riding a bike.
He likes to understand how the universe works, as well as his role in it, even though it is small, and feels much gratitude in taking part as actor and observer in the fascinating show of life. To him, biology is a fantastic way to see the world, for it explains the relations from microorganisms to large and complex interactions that happen in our planet.
He is also interested in astrobiology, amazed by how life is able to reach extreme places in so many different ways, reinventing the concept of life itself, and in synthetic biology, as a wonderful tool to understand and deal with the processes that happen in living organisms. Besides, he enjoys camping and tracking, traveling to different places and getting to know different people, cultures and religions.

Macarena López
Undergraduate in Biology - IB/USP
She is chilean but currently lives São Paulo, Brazil. She is at her third year of college and second year in the iGEM competition, but more than synthetic biology, what she really love is the anthropology field.
Maca (as she likes to be called) loves traveling around the world, learning new languages and getting to know different cultures. One of her dreams is to one day continue her research career in Germany.

Cauã Westmann
Undergraduate in Biology - IB/USP
Cauã is an undergraduate biologist passionated by life and its mysteries. He tries to understand everything in the most holistic way, from the origins of life to the evolution of complex systems, and found in science a path for his long quest.
Somewhere in the way a wild Synthetic Biology appeared joining so many areas of knowledge that Cauã could not resist. He was totally dragged into it!
He is learning a lot with the iGEM competition inside the lab and out of it, taking part in the Human Practices Project in order to approach society and science in a better way.
At this moment he is working with Molecular Biology in order to better understand the processes that underlie a “well known” and at the same time very complex phenomenon called Life.

Pedro Henrique Moreira Pessoa
Undergraduate in Molecular Sciences - CCM/USP
Pedrão (Portuguese for Big O'Peter or Big Pedro) is a very tall guy who is usually wondering about how small and imprecise is his knowledge compared to the size of the Universe and the Complexity of Human Societies. He is usually talking about Epistemology, Logic and Information Theory.
Started his scientific career studying Statistical Mechanics Models in Psychology and Sociology. And jumped into the iGEM competition seeing the love of some friends for the area and believing his mathematical ideas could help the development of some amazing projects in Synthetic Biology inspired by the competition.
Is a big fan of video-games (esecially Final Fantasy and Zelda series), Pixar movies, Asimov, Tolkien and board/card games. This kind of geek stuff inpired him a lot to develop a part of our Human Practices project, the “Game of Genes”.

Alec Spinhirne
I am a senior majoring in Biomedical Engineering.
Because I'm a natural born leader,  I was destined to take command of this great team.
I enjoy wearing cowboy boots 24/7 and my teammates have been
known to count the number of sighs I make. -sigh-
I <3 Texas!
Lana Khazma
I am a sophomore Molecular Biology major, and I have definitely
learned a lot this summer on the iGEM team! I have become a master at
html coding and now all my teammates bow down to my powers.
Aside from a series of sleepless nights, I have realized my true passions
this summer: tumblr, eating, sleeping, and pizza.
Martin Savard-Rosas
My hobbies include rock climbing, watching movies, and playing
football. I am Canadian and I love maple butter (whatever that is).
When in Canada, I plan on spending my time at the local Costco.
I have learned from my iGem team that it is unacceptable
to wear white socks with black shoes.
Janice Chuang
I’m a biology junior and I enjoy napping, making sushi for the whole team,
and I am excellent at drawing puppies and teeth. Also, I am loved on the team
because I bring fresh muffins, donuts, and ice cream for those late nights in lab.
I am the team chauffeur that drives the members to local restaurants when in
desperate need of a break!
Samantha Preisser
I am a Senior Biochemistry major working on a Spanish minor.
My hobbies include cooking and hanging out with my cat, Odin.
I am the president of the UTD Comet Cat Coalition.
I love Oregon and spending time outdoors!
I make a mean tuna casserole and have introduced cotton candy
grapes to the team. They taste like the real thing!
Elise Bullock
I also enjoy cats, especially my kitten Haley. I am
excellent at speed (the card game). I am the resident genius
with the ability to solve any problem and to read any illegible
handwriting. After an exhausting and long day in lab, I like to
watch football and baseball- Go Rangers!
Tracy Truong
I’m a biochemistry sophomore. I am known for my complete awesomeness,
and I have the grace of a gazelle, the speed of a cheetah, and the strength of a
really strong animal. I'm a master at t-shirt designing as well, and I am
always prepared with snacks in case someone throws a fit.
Rashed Rihani
I'm a sophomore Biomedical Engineering major.
I definitely enjoyed being a part of iGEM, and it truly
has been an eye opening experience. I am known for my
killer good looks that can kill bacteria on the spot!
My hobbies include volunteering, studying, and video games.
Matthew Lantz
I'm a ""fun-guy"". But really, I’m known around on the streets for my
legendary banana bread. Also, I provide board games and cards as we’re
waiting for our PCR or ligation. Since I am a certified giant, I am assigned
the task of getting all the supplies for the shorter members.

Secret garden
Congratulations! You've found our secret garden! Follow the instructions below and win a great prize at the World jamboree!
A video shows that two of our team members are having great fun at our favourite company. Do you know the name of the second member that appears in the video?
For one of our models we had to do very extensive computations. To prevent our own computers from overheating and to keep the temperature in our iGEM room at a normal level, we used a supercomputer. Which centre maintains this supercomputer? (Dutch abbreviation)
We organised a symposium with a debate, some seminars and 2 iGEM project presentations. An iGEM team came all the way from the Netherlands to present their project. What is the name of their city?
Now put all of these in this URL:https://2013.igem.org/Team:KU_Leuven/(firstname)(abbreviation)(city), (loose the brackets and put everything in lowercase) and follow the very last instruction to get your special jamboree prize!

Sponsors
Meet our most generous sponsors!
The Team Members
16 enthusiastic KU Leuven students who don’t mind working the whole summer join hands to kick some ass, iGEM style. It’s a very diverse team consisting of students with different backgrounds. There are 10 guys and 6 girls present with studies in biochemistry, (bio-)engineering, medicine, philosophy and others. The team is supported by former iGEMers and employees from all levels of the KU Leuven.
Aurelie Lenaerts
Biomedical sciences - Sponsoring & Wiki
Hell’s to the no if it isn’t Aurelie hopping up and down the stairs to get things done. This energetic member of our team will help with anything as long as it’s not taking care of insects. Between seducing sponsors and sparking the interest of young students for synthetic biology she almost made us walk 100 kilometers just to sponsor our iGEM adventure.
Bert Mortier
Chemical Engineering - Modelling & Human Practices
Bert is one tough critic! Everything a KU Leuven iGEMer does/makes/says will be inspected, scrutinised and commented on by Bert. Luckily then, that he is on the Ethics team so that synthetic biology cannot slip by without being inspected in every way possible. Bert is a chemical engineer who is fascinated by biochemistry and microbial life. You can find him working hard at our iGEM office, on his beloved oscillator model.
Flore De Wit
Biochemistry & Biotechnology - Sponsoring & Outreach
With a strong female presence in the KU Leuven iGEM team, Flore is power woman number 1. Flore is studying a Master of Biochemistry and Biotechnology. When she is not busy finding sponsors for the team, she will be busy in the lab and when she has tackled that, you could find her helping the education team out or doing a literature study. On top of that, Flore finds the time to enjoy running, travelling and baking! Showing you the power of Women in Science.
Frederik Meynen
Biochemistry & Biotechnology - Wiki & Outreach
Besides focusing on his Biochemistry and Biotechnology studies, Frederik likes to get lost in the woods and find his way back using a map and a compass. Other hobbies are bragging about the fact that he lives in the same city (read: village) as cyclist Tom Boonen, taking his Gene Technology exam for yet another time and working on our wiki since he loves informatics as well. Actually, in retrospect, we don’t  really know why we hang out with him. Oh yeah, probably because he has the most contagious laugh ever known to mankind and he’s a really nice guy to be around.
Laurens De Backer
Biochemistry & Biotechnology - Wetlab
This guitar playing rock star is, yes you guessed it, also a Master student in Biochemistry and Biotechnology! Laurens likes to keep us entertained by singing and dancing iGEM medley versions of classics (if you would like to see him in action, join us on facebook or youtube for video uploads!) and in his spare time he likes to come to the lab and help out by singing to some pipets instead. Besides the common Belgian hobby of beer drinking, Laurens is also very interested in signal transduction and cell regulation.
Lukas Marcelis
Medicine - Wetlab & Human Practices
Lukas is for sure the most energetic one of our team! Coordinating the wetlab and discussing (especially ethics) is one of his top favourite occupations this summer. Next to iGEM, this future doctor  is also vice-president of the Leuven student-researchers association (LVSO). Next to his 24h science job, he also likes to have fun with his friends and enjoys sausages at the BBQ, combined with some booze. In September, he is planning to go scouting in the Amazon forest.
Michael Poorthuis
Philosophy - Human Practices
Michael Poorthuis is graduate student in philosophy at the KU Leuven and graduate student in medicine at Utrecht University. He provided an ethical review of our iGEM project of which the leading question was: Are ethics related to technological progress, viz synthetic biology, or is it like a sermon on Sunday, totally separated from everyday reality?
Pieter De Bruyn
Bio-engineering - Wetlab & Communication
Pieter is one of the wetlab boys whose main occupation is to run from one freezer to another. If this student Bio-engineering (Cell and gene technology) is not busy in the wetlab cloning 20 different genes at once, he’s probably sitting quiet in a corner in the iGEM room, making some new memes. When Pieter’s around, you always feel at ease. He is fan of rock music, a good movie and a cooled beer. Combine the last with any of the first two and he’s good to go.
Robbert Boudewijns
Biochemistry & Biotechnology - Outreach & Wetlab
Meet Robbert, he will be your guide to the internet. Also, to cats. And funny videos. Next, this Biochemistry & Biotechnology lover also likes to play volleyball, is active in the student movement and often writes texts for the Leuven student newspaper.  Oh, and sorry Ke$ha, but the party don't start 'till Robbert walks in.
Saar Vandekeere
Biomedical Sciences - Logistics
Saar is a true jack-of-all-trades. She is perfectly capable of jumping in to help out in the lab when needed, organising great barbecues, she is making sure that we have the most awesome gadgets, the best looking T-shirts and most importantly getting us to Lyon! With her high energy level, there’s no river too deep, no mountain too high and no problem she can’t handle. Thumbs up for the best logistics team member ever!
Sabine Thieren
Medicine - Outreach & Communication
Sabine is our “education girl” of this summer, which matches perfectly with her dream of becoming a fantastic doctor. Being busy during summers as student-researcher, she still enjoys playing the bassoon in her spare time. Now, she’s keeping herself busy with giving presentations in secondary schools. With her drawing skills, she was even able to create a 3D model of our bacterium, which is now being used during the workshops in schools.
Sander Wuyts
Bio-engineering - Modelling & Logistics
This blonde, confident guy is Sander, also known as Sandieboy. Currently, he is pursuing his Masters degree in Bioscience Engineering: Cell and Gene technology, and he has a big interest in bio-informatics. Whenever he is not reading one article for three days, he is busy with modelling, and trying to create more efficient, dependent feedback mechanisms and interactions between the wetlab and the modelling teams. Sander has a really big temper, but in the weekends he dances all his troubles away, on events like Tomorrowland.
Su Wang
Molecular & Cellular Biophysics - Wetlab & Wiki
Su Wang, also known as Dinox, is in his first year of the Master in Molecular and Cellular Biophysics. He is currently proving himself to be quite the animal in the lab! From dawn till dusk you can find Su in the lab, dancing with some pipets. He is one of the most sweetest Chinese we ever met, and likes to please everyone with his golden smile.
Sylvie Weckx
Bio-engineering - Sponsoring, Wetlab & Logistics
Sylvie is the one you really need to pay attention to, since she is the best in persuading you to sponsor the KULeuven iGEM team 2013. Everybody is undoubtedly charmed by her writing skills. In normal daily life, Sylvie studies Bioscience Engineering: Cell and Gene Biotechnology with a minor in Plant Production. For her Master Thesis she will be studying stress in plants. In the little spare time that’s left for her, she likes to go climbing with friends, mountainbiking and snowboarding.
Tina Smets
Biomedical Sciences - Modelling & Communication
Tina is, except for being a master student in Biomedical Sciences, also the only woman in our modelling group this year. Thanks to her female influence, all male modellers are doomed to follow a strict time schedule. When she’s not roaming the world of synthetic biology, she often goes swimming or is busy reading books. Interestingly, she has an incomprehensible affection for insects –even loves to eat them as well- and loves to go to metal festivals –completely dressed up.
Tomas Van Pottelbergh
Electrical Engineering - Modelling
Tomas was raised in Geetbets, but came to the big city of Leuven to study Electrical Engineering, minoring in Living Systems. He is a busy bird as he is part of the European students organisation BEST as well as iGEM. Tomas is also exploring the world of entomophagy, although aphids are still not in his every day diet. He is part of the modelling team, where he is busy trying to make a model of the ecology around the bacteria. He has developed a rather special bond with teammate Bert, of which the extent is still a mystery to us.
The Instructors
Ingmar Claes
Post-Doc
Ingmar is currently a postdoctoral researcher at the Centre of Microbial and Plant Genetics . After his studies of bio-engineering, he did a PhD on the probiotic bacterium Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG. In this PhD, he studied the factors determining the probiotic effect of the L. rhamnosus GG in experimental colitis. Interdisciplinary studies were performed combining bacterial genetics and immunology. He always had and still has a profound interest in scientific research, especially linking applied microbiology, mucosal immunology and health issues. The opportunity to guide the students on this iGEM project in a rather new field of synthetic biology looked very appealing and fascinating but also challenging.
Veerle De Wever
Post-Doc
Meet Veerle, she loves science but also values non-scientific aspects such as sponsoring, administration, logistics, ... Leuven is her hometown but she went abroad to obtain her PhD in genetics and biochemistry from the University of Vienna (Austria). While doing a postdoc in Canada, she came in contact with iGEM via the Calgary team of 2011, 2012. She was sold immediately and, upon her return to Leuven, more than happy to support the KU Leuven team. Her research interests lie with signal transduction; particularly in response to environmental changes. Currently she is working as a postdoctoral researcher in the lab of Prof. Dr. Mathieu Bollen ( Dept of Cellular and Molecular Medicine ) on protein phosphatases and their roles as master metabolic regulators in health and disease.
Johan Robben
Professor
Professor Dr. Johan Robben is a member of the Department of Chemistry, section Biochemistry, Molecular and Structural Biology at the KU Leuven. He is leading the Laboratory of Molecular and Synthetic Biology which currently focusses on polymerases and artificial nucleic acids. His main expertise is in molecular biology, protein engineering, genomics and proteomics. He was scientific advisor of the KU Leuven iGEM student teams in 2008 , 2009 and 2011 .
The Advisors
Sam De Vlieger
Philosophy Student
Sam is currently doing a Master in Philosophy at the KU Leuven. As advisor of the iGEM team he hopes to gain an understanding of the scientific process in the field of synthetic biology, and more specifically, the role of ethics within this process.
Other Advisors
Thanks to Misha Soskine for his unending tips, tricks, suggestions, wacky stories and ideas!
The KU Leuven iGEM alumni also came out in full force again - a huge Mexican wave of ""thank you hands"" goes, in no particular order, to Ruben Ghillebert ; Hanne Tytgat ; Tom Broeckx for his help to the sponsor team; Marian Crabbe ; Lyn Venken ; and all others who added in a word of advice through the past months.

Collaborations
INSA Toulouse
Already in mid-June INSA Toulouse asked us to send a brick. From our own experience, we knew that ordering bricks from the registry could take some time. Therefore we helped out the team of INSA Toulouse by sending them the brick BBa_K145150 from the KU Leuven team of 2008.
Purdue
The 2013 Purdue iGEM team started a project to bring a new standard to the datasheets. We gladly participated as we also consider this a serious problem. After filling out their first survey and giving suggestion for the datasheets, we filled in their Doodle and participated in their video conference. Next, we helped them out by filling in their second survey and making some more suggestions for their standardised datasheets.
Eindhoven
The 2013 TU-Eindhoven iGEM team started their ""synthetic facts"" project . With this they want to bring the world of synthetic biology closer to everyone (scientist & non-scientist) in a correct manner. They provide facts that are thoroughly analysed by different teams and given a final statement noting that the fact is either true, false or undecided. We were happy to contribute some of our time to checking a fact and got this nice medal for it!
BeNe(Lux) – UGent & Groningen
In the beginning of July, the idea of organising a debate attracted us. After consulting multiple people (Professors, PhD students,…), we found out that everyone noticed the need for such a debate. Furthermore, they advised us to give the general academic public an introduction on synthetic biology and iGEM. The idea was therefore extended to a symposium followed by a debate. We invited all teams of the BeNe(Lux), from which the team of UGent and Groningen responded positively. After introductory seminars by Prof. J. Robben and Prof. K. Verstrepen, and our own project presentation, we were pleased to welcome the team of Groningen. After a five hour drive they still kept their enthusiasm for the Symposium. After some ‘Belgian’ fries we were ready for the debate. The end of the day was closed with a reception where the people could further debate.
The KU Leuven attentively listening to Groningen’s project presentation

We were able to participate in the iGEM competition thanks to Prof. Joris Winderickx and the KU Leuven BioSCENTer , the Center for Bio-Science, Bio-Engineering and Bio-Technology.
BioSCENTer’s mission is to integrate expertise on biology and biomedicine; to stimulate interaction between experts and to foster cross-fertilization of disciplines.  BioSCENTer wants to create visibility in research, teaching and valorisation by appropriate branding and scientific outreach. Sounds like a perfect match with iGEM to us ?! We are very grateful for the opportunity and hope BioSCENTer will keep up the iGEM vibe at the KU Leuven! We did our molecular biology experiments in the Laboratory of Molecular and Synthetic Biology under supervision of Johan Robben and his lab members. We would like to thank all of them for the help and advice they've given us during the summer. They strongly believed in letting us do our own experiments! In the end, we are thankful for all the hands-on experience we gained this summer!
Thanks also to the Centre of Microbial and Plant Genetics and especially Elke Van Assche, David De Coster and Tine Verhoeven for their help and patience during our qPCR adventure.
Another big thank you to the other lab on the second floor, the group of Prof. Giovanni Maglia , working on Nanopore devices, for their help and support in finding our way through a hall with identical doors with media, buffers, ... hiding behind them!
Finally, thanks to our administrative supporters! First and foremost to Cathy Hendrickx , who helped us take care of our finances and made sure we were all booked on the right flights with the proper paperwork! Thanks also to Anouk Desmet , an invaluable part of the iGEM selection committee, a rockstar in ISP organisation and our connection to the Medical Faculty.Also Liesbeth Van Meerbeek deserves a big hurrah for continuously adapting the iGEM BioSCENTer website to our wishes, usually last moment and under time pressure .... Last but not least, we thank Mimi Deprez . She facilitated access to the fancy poster printer (multiple times ...), is an important part of the iGEM selection committee and a steady and calm presence in the face of press deadlines and meetings. We couldn't have done it without them, so THANKS !!!

On this team page you can find the students and advisors of the team. They all worked really hard on E.coligy: plants with BanAphids! Of course, we could only do this because off all the help we got from a lot of different people. We thanked them under 'attributions'. If you are being helped, you should also help. This is why we started some collaborations with other teams, including a very first, very small gathering of the Benelux iGEM teams. More about this can be found under collaborations.

Combing the outstanding students from Nanjing University and Nanjing University of Technology, we are trying to make the CRISPR/Cas systems work in the eukaryote cell with the help of the synthetic biology methods. Furthermore, considering the spacers' sequence as the result of evolution, our team is developing a highly-probable algorithm to direct the synthesis and seeking of spacers or proto-spacers.
Ruitao Jin, I am the leader of our team. As a junior studying biophysics at Nanjing University, I have learned life sciences for two years. I undertake the task for making the team come into existence and I am the major participator in envisaging the blueprint for our experiments, revising the protocols and conducting the experiments. When I am not in the lab, I always enjoy myself by learning physics.
Cao Zhe, I’m a junior from Nanjing University majoring in Life Sciences. Like most guys in 20s, I’m a big fan of sports, movie and computer games. Also like most guys around at the similar age, I’m still perplexed about my future plan. To be rough, I’m fancy with the basic cellular signal and transduction, which related closely to the synthetic biology. In our team, my job is to coordinate the experiment, research, financing and presentation affairs. Considering the purpose when taking part in this contest, always, the essence of discovery gives us the priority. We might pursue after different directions after all of this, but the 10-month journey for the iGEM can always be inspiring and referential when starting our long or short, but always tough research career.
This is Lin Lei, a junior from Nanjing University majoring in Life Sciences. He is interested in electrochemistry and biomedical engineering research. Impressed by the mechanism of CRISPER system, he decided to join the team.  Outside the lab, he is a heavy soccer fan. During the program, he found systems biology became part of his motivation to continue pursuing his Ph.D degree.;
Min Xi, 20 year-old student in Department of Laws, Nanjing University. He enjoy reading, badminton in my daily life and he’s fascinated in the world of biochemistry and synthetic biology. He play a role of major designer and coordinator of the scheme, experiment and presentation during this project.
I am Tian Li, a third year student，who comes from Nanjing University. I study life science in university. I like comic and reading. iGEM is the best competition that I have ever participated in. It made me fully aware the hardships and charm of science. And I made lots of friend during the experiment.
I’m Sitong He, a 21 years old girl from Nanjing University. I’m majoring Life Science. My interests are electrophoresis, Er Hu(a traditional Chinese instrument) and landscape ecological planning. In our IGEM team, I am in charge of conducting the experiment and controlling the outflow of funds. Moreover, I do some work for broadcasting and for our website.
I'm Xiali Luan, a sophomore student majoring in Life Sciences, studying in Nanjing University now. I like my major and I also like geographical science. Except doing scientific research, I also like doing some hand-working and sports like basketball. My job in the team is helping doing some experiments and conducting public diplomacy programs.
Yunyun He, I am a year 3 undergraduate in school of life sciences, NJU. To be honest, I had few lab experiences before this project. However, as a initial member of out team, I forced myself to swallow bunches of new knowledge, new information and new technology throughout the past few months. As the superintendent for a time, I learnt how to arrange our lab time to ensure efficiency and how to design detailed experiment to test an idea or to find out why it didn’t work. All of these experiences will be of great help in my study life later. I like basketball, and I also would like to work out in the gym. Besides, I am a super fun of cycling. I would like to enjoy my leisure time in a healthy way.

Grenoble-EMSE-LSU, iGEM
Advisors and Instructors
From the creation of the team in January until now, we have been advised and helped by several persons: teachers, researchers, former members of iGEM teams.
Without their help and advice, our work would have been a lot harder in every aspect of this project. For the scientific part of course, but also for other matters like planning, logistics... That is why we wanted to especially thank all of them.
You can read their presentations below for further information:
Robert Baptist , Geoffrey Bouchage , Franz Bruckert , Alexandre Dawid , Valérie Forest , Hans Geiselmann , Hidde de Jong , Pierre Pautré , Stéphane Pinhal , Delphine Ropers , Marianne Weidenhaupt
Robert Baptist
CEA-LETI, Minatec
Research Director
Robert Baptist joined CEA-LETI, a laboratory for microelectronics, in 1982. His main research interest was solid state physics and information and their applications to micro-nano technologies. Working on nano-sciences since 2000 opened him new horizons thanks to the study of hybrid materials. The door was opened to bacteria! In 2010 he participated to the creation of the first iGEM group in Grenoble and learned a lot about the relationship of computers to living cells and also about pedagogy! Learning so much just before retiring is a big pleasure in a professional career!
Geoffrey Bouchage
Grenoble INP - Phelma
My first iGEM experience was in 2011 as a student in the first iGEM Grenoble team. It was a wonderful experience and skills I developped really helped me to find my actual and first job. iGEM is much more than a synthetic biology competition, it's a life and professional experience which gives you several advantages for a future career. That's why I'm still here, since 2012, as an advisor to try to help new students to learn as much as possible, further than technical skills.
Franz Bruckert
Grenoble INP
Teacher researcher in biology
To my point of view, the most interesting aspect of the iGEM project is the collective construction of a new way of doing bioengineering. The modular approach is clearly more efficient in terms of experimental effort and it also helps understanding how cellular functions are organized. Implementing new functions in bacteria should in turn help to build up more efficient ways to represent the living beings complexity. Besides that, I like and challenges and iGEM is all of this.
Alexandre Dawid
Grenoble University
Teacher researcher in physics and biology
As an engineer and physicist from background, I very early got fascinated by the ingenious and exquisite molecular mechanisms at play in living systems. After developing instruments to study genetic recombination at the single molecule level, I moved to the field of bioengineering in microorganisms. My current research combines computational and experimental approaches to engineer genetic systems in bacteria, more specifically regulatory functions in genetic circuits, using the versatility of RNA and RNA-based mechanisms, e.g. riboswitches. Joining quantitative models and experimental techniques at the bio-molecular level with the diversity at hand in Nature stimulates the imagination and opens up new pathways for innovation. Similarly, the iGEM competition challenges our way of thinking about the living and embarks an interdisciplinary team of talented students through the whole process of a creative project, from the vision to the achievement. A very stimulating and enrich! ing scientific and human experience.
Valérie Forest
ENSM Saint-Etienne
PhD, Teacher Researcher in biology
Graduated in Biologic and Medical Engineering, I am assistant Professor at Ecole Nationale Supérieure des Mines de Saint-Etienne. I especially work in the field of nanotechnologies, but our engineering school is also highly interested in the development of synthetic biology and strongly believes in its outstanding applications. The iGEM competition gives us the opportunity to work in close collaboration with other regional and international institutions in a very interdisciplinary field. This exceptional experience is highly interesting, motivating and rewarding for students and advisors both on scientific and human aspects.
Hans Geiselmann
Grenoble University
Teacher researcher in microbiology
I am a microbiologist at the university of Grenoble. In the past, I have combined biophysics, molecular biology and bacteriology to understand the functioning of Escherichia coli. More recently, in a systems biology approach, I have used precise measurements of gene expression to test predictions of mathematical models of the corresponding regulatory system. Synthetic biology, and thus iGEM, is the next step in understanding biological systems: if we really understand the functioning of a system, we can modify its behavior. In iGEM we move from designing a desired behavior to instantiating the network in the real organism: a formidable challenge in interdisciplinary research and a very stimulating endeavor, in large parts thanks to a team of excellent and motivated students from different backgrounds.
Hidde de Jong
Inria Grenoble - Rhônes-Alpes
PhD in computer science, University of Twente, the Netherlands
An engineer by training, I like to do interdisciplinary research, at the interface of biology, computer science, and mathematics. More specifically, since a number of years I have been interested in the modeling of the regulatory networks controlling the functioning of  bacteria. Synthetic biology proposes an interesting approach for better understanding these networks: can we modify the network connections so as to extend the behavioral repertoire of bacterial cells? The iGEM competition addresses these questions in an original way, at the same time playful and highly demanding.
Pierre Pautré
Grenoble University Master 2 studies in physiologic and epigenetic development
I am mainly interested in microbiology and genetics. I think that the multidisciplinary approach proposed by iGEM is a great way to share, open new horizons and learn to work in teams. Last year I was in the Grenoble team and I hope I can share this experience with the iGEM Grenoble-EMSE-LSU team.
Stéphane Pinhal
LAPM
PhD student in Systems and Synthetic Biology
Interested in engineering the living, I joined the iGEM Paris Liliane Bettencourt 2010 team. I think iGEM is very formative on both scientific and human side. So I couldn't miss this adventure. We won the Best Foundational Advance Prize. In 2011, I was the advisor of the iGEM Grenoble team. It was a new challenge because it was the first participation of a team from Grenoble. I shared my experience with them and help them to reach the Final. In order to have a place where you can talk and share about Synthetic Biology, I've founded the first club of Synthetic Biology in Grenoble: SynBioGre. In 2012, I decided to renew this experience and I was also an advisor of the iGEM Grenoble team. This year, I'm an advisor of the iGEM Grenoble-EMSE-LSU team … again! Rise and shine Grenoble 2013 ! ;)
Delphine Ropers
Inria Grenoble - Rhônes-Alpes
Researcher in system biology
Graduated in Biochemistry,  I developed a strong interest for pluridisciplinarity in the course of my training. I received a PhD in Molecular Biology from Nancy University for my work on the regulation of HIV-1 RNA alternative splicing by modeling and experimental approaches. I am now a researcher within the Systems Biology group Ibis at Inria Grenoble - Rhône-Alpes, a French research institute in computer science and control. I work on the mathematical modeling and experimental validation of biochemical regulatory networks involved in bacterial adaptation to environmental cues.
Marianne Weidenhaupt
Grenoble INP
Teacher researcher in biology and immunology
I am a biology and immunology teacher at the Grenoble Institute of Technology-Phelma. One of the important points of my teaching is to train students to be able to work at the interface of different scientific disciplines. iGEM is a very exciting challenge that plunges us straight into interdisciplinarity and puts teachers and students face to face with what we aim for in our daily work. Personally I worked in bacterial genetics during my PhD, a field I left some 15 years ago and which I am more than happy to work in again with our team.

Our Team
This year, our team is composed of students from various horizons. We have a majority of Grenoble students (six) but also two students from Saint-Etienne and even one American student from Louisiana, making our team international !
We are six studying engineering, and three studying in college. You can read our presentations below for further information:
Sarah Amblard , Hélène Arduin , Alexis Félix , Stewart Humble , Quentin Lubart , Simon Pacouret , Adrien Rapeaux , Nicolas Roehri , François Rousse
Sarah Amblard
Grenoble University
Licence 2 International Chemestry and Biology
At the very first time I heard of iGEM it sounded like a great idea to me: giving a group of student the opportunity to work together on their own project, each team being a sort of melting pot of skills and knowledge. I also like the fact that this competition highlights synthetic biology, which is not well recognised by the students.
Hélène Arduin
Grenoble INP - Phelma
Master 1 Physics and Nanosciences
As a physics student, I would really like to discover a new field, biology, which I do not have studied before. I wish to work on a research lab after graduating, and I think the iGEM project is a great opportunity to discover this environment and to work as a team, in collaboration with various research labs. The international dimension of this project is also really motivating: we will be given the opportunity to compare ideas with teams from all around the world !
Alexis Félix
ENSM Saint-Etienne
Master 1 Fundamental Physics and Health-Engineering
I conceive my participation to the iGEM project as a way to deal with many different scientific knowledge as well as experimental exercises in order to reach an unbelievable goal in synthetic biology. Therefore I’m glad to be a member of Grenoble-St-Etienne-LSU team because this project deals with hard technical issues and wouldn’t be possible without a strong team work. According to my point of view, this must be a step for my future career.
Stewart W. Humble
Louisiana State University
BSc Biological Sciences
When I first heard about becoming involved with the iGEM team at Grenoble, I immediately jumped on the opportunity.  Taking some time to learn more about iGEM, I researched projects from previous years, and found the premise of the competition was very interesting.  The promise of a truly unique and rewarding international experience and the opportunity to represent LSU on a global scale are what I am most looking forward to as I become more involved with the team at Grenoble.
Quentin Lubart
Grenoble University
Master 2 Nanobiology and Nanobiotechnology
When I was introduced to iGEM my immediate reaction was: ""I have to participate."" I see this event as a chance to make a technical prowess at the top of innovation in a growing field, all of this at a very high international level. Many efforts are made to ensure that the only barrier we have is imagination, how to resist?
Simon Pacouret
Grenoble INP - Phelma
Biotechnologies
“All together, design, develop, test and present your own biological system, in a pluridisciplinary and international context.” It sounded to me like a golden opportunity at both the scientific and human level, and iGEM has been a very formative and fulfilling experience so far. Optogenetics offers bright prospects to the understanding and treatment of a broad set of diseases, including cancer and brain disorders. I am glad that we found a project related to that field, in which I would like to be involved in the future.
Adrien Rapeaux
Grenoble INP - Phelma
Biotechnologies
The iGEM competition incarnates the interface between one of my main subjects of interest – synthetic biology - and other fields such as modelling, electronics, optics and environmental sciences. The sheer opportunity it represents is what really drove me to participate in this ambitious and fun project. With the multitude of different aspects to take care of, I believe the competition will provide invaluable experience on working as a team, using rigorous techniques in a laboratory environment. Finally, as research is never an endeavour to be undertaken alone, even as a team, I look forward to interacting with iGEM teams all over the world.
Nicolas Roehri, aka Rorri Stark, the king in the Lab !
Grenoble INP - Phelma
Biotechnologies
The iGEM competition seems to me to be a great way to apply all the skills and techniques I learned during my studies at Grenoble INP – Phelma. As a student in Bioengineering, this competition will allow me to improve my knowledge in molecular biology and learn to deal with problems that can occur in lab work. Moreover, since we have this year an international team, it will be a good opportunity to share different points of view or approach on several items.
That's why I needed to be part of the adventure !
François Rousse, aka Dolphman, the jester in the Lab !
ENSM Saint-Etienne
Applied Mathematics and Computer Science
I had know the iGEM competition 2 years ago when friends participated. I saw in it the most efficient and clever way to impel and spread a young and thriving science. I heard that real revolutions can only come from life sciences, the iGEM competition is a unique opportunity to be part of it.

The iGEM Team Braunschweig
Spread the ideas of student research from Braunschweig internationally for the first time?
Represent our university in the renowned iGEM competition for the first time?
Yes, that’s our goal! And that is why we launched the first TU Braunschweig iGEM team.  We are a motley crew: Bachelor- and Master students of Biotechnology, PhD students who support the team with their expertise in lab work and act as supervisors and communication scientists who are responsible for press and public relations. From March until October we focused on successfully completing our project and had a good time with our fantastic first TU Braunschweig iGEM team!
Team Members
Name: Jan-Michael Blum
Age: 24
Occupation: Master student of Biotechnology
Why I take part in the iGEM competition:
iGEM combines the challenges of a complex project realistically. Hence the competition simulates a task profile, which might occur in future jobs as well. Learning these manifold interactions is my motivation.
Name: Lara Ehemann
Age: 24
Occupation: Master student of Communication Studies
Why I take part in the iGEM competition:
As I am no natural scientist I never heard of the iGEM-competition before. Now I am responsible for press and public relations and I am sure that iGEM has a lot to offer: not only research but also teamwork, networking and the promotion of young academics are part of the competition. For me, the interdisciplinary concept is especially important: I can pass on my knowledge to the scientists among us and in return I get an insight into synthetic biology.
Name: Roman Hilje
Age: 24
Occupation: Master student of Biotechnology
Why I take part in the iGEM competition:
Because it will definitely be a lot of fun!
Name: Oliver Konzock
Age: 21
Occupation: Bachelor student of Biotechnology
Why I take part in the iGEM competition:
This competition offers various interesting opportunities, such as using my  knowledge and learning new stuff. Additionally, I enjoy creating a project from A to Z including collecting and discussing ideas, financial issues, PR and finally realizing our ideas.
Name: Kevin Kramm
Age: 24
Occupation: Master student of Biotechnology
Why I take part in the iGEM competition:
To put the skills acquired during my studies to use in an exciting project. Protein overexpression in a labcourse isn’t exactly thrilling. Creating a fully functional molecular machine for iGEM – that’s a real challenge.
Name: Kerstin Kretschmer
Age: 23
Occupation: Master student of Biotechnology
Why I take part in the iGEM competition:
The iGEM-competition gives me the opportunity to develop ideas in a group and experience the path from having the idea to the realization of the project and the final presentation of results. In difference to the everyday university life I’ll be not only confronted with the scientific but also the organizational aspects of a project. In addition, I can take part at the international level in the synthetic biology research and exchange ideas with other participants.
Name: Judith Mönch-Tegeder
Age: 25
Occupation: Master student of Biotechnology
Why I take part in the iGEM competition:
I am part of the iGEM team Braunschweig to experience the unique atmosphere of an international competition. Doing so I can show what can be accomplished in the field of synthetic biology.
Name: Melanie Philippi
Age: 20
Occupation: Bachelor student of biotechnology
Why I take part in the iGEM competition:
The project offers opportunities that rarely occur during academic studies. I hope to consolidate and extend my knowledge during the iGEM competition. Taking part in such a project with nice and diverse team members is great, exciting and exceptional!
Name: Laura Schild
Age: 23
Occupation: Master student of biotechnology
Why I take part in the iGEM competition:
I became part of the TU Braunschweig iGEM-team to meet new people, share thoughts and ideas and work on our own team project. To meet students from other, especially international teams sounds very exciting to me! Working as a team, I hope that we will all benefit from each other, get an insight in all areas of the project and of course have a great time!
Name: Anna Wronska
Age: 19
Occupation: Bachelor student of biotechnology
Why I take part in the iGEM competition:
The iGEM competition provides me the opportunity to gain important experience for my further carrier as a scientist. They way from the first idea of a project to its completion in the end, is really challenging. During this process every team member will rise to meet the challenges and together we will have a lot of fun.
Instructors
Name: Tobias Unkauf
Age: 25
Occupation: PhD student
Why I take part in the iGEM competition:
During my undergraduate studies I’ve heard of IGEM and was immediately fascinated by the concept to pursue ideas in the laboratory beyond the prescribed curriculum and translate them into a great project on your own. Unfortunately, it is very difficult to establish a major project like iGEM as an undergraduate student if there is no structure and experience from previous participations at the university.  Since then, the desire to participate in the iGEM-competition has never quite left me. As a PhD student, I took the chance and I will supervise the first iGEM-Team of the TU Braunschweig together with Jonas. I look forward to an exciting international competition, a lively exchange with other teams and most important: a lot of fun and new experiences!
Name: Jonas Zantow
Age: 26
Occupation: PhD student
Why I take part in the iGEM competition:
It is fun to face the competition with a team of motivated students. Apart from the scientific challenge I’m looking forward to meet the other teams for an exchange of thoughts.

30px Katarzyna Chyzynska
My name is Kasia and I am a workaholic. I also happen to be 2nd year MSc student of Systems Biology at DTU. I am a fan of bioinformatics, computational biology-based research and getting tan under a laminar flow cabinet (true story). And now that I still do not expect to be paid for my work I have decided to join the iGEM team to work on the damn cool project and put my skills to good use.
Helen Cook
I've just finished the first year of my Systems Biology MSc at DTU.  In a nutshell, this means I write code to study biologically relevant patterns in genomic information, and I make predictions that can be tested experimentally.   I joined the iGEM team because my concept of 'fun' includes dedicating my summer to work on a big project with other committed people.  Synthetic biology can be used to build a more sustainable future for us and our planet, and I'm excited to be a part of a team that is making that happen. Also, I am quite fond of chocolate cake.
30px Kristian Davidsen
Biology and chemistry are my biggest interest and also a sort of hobby to me so I chose to study biotechnology because of the mix of the two. I joined the DTU iGEM team to learn synthetic biology and to get the experience of doing it. I also like the idea that you can go into the lab and create something that has never been made before. When I’m not doing school work I enjoy watching sports like football, handball and boxing but road cycling beats them all. My favorite cake is banana cake with big chunks of chocolate.
Ariadni Droumpali
I am an environmental engineer, really excited to be on the iGEM team. I come from Greece with a background in Environmental Engineering and my study line on the master in DTU is Environmental Microbiology. My inspiration about microbiology is encouraged while working with other team members from different study fields like biology, chemistry, biotechnology as we contribute in our ambition to complete this project.  When I am not in lab, university or class, I enjoy participating in film festivals and a photography team. My favorite cake is brownies with chocolate and nuts!
30px Piotr Dworzynski
Hi there! I just handed in my MSc thesis in Computer Science at DTU. My main areas of interest are high-performance computing, distributed systems and web applications. I joined the team as although, I have been working in as a scientific programmer in bioinformatics for quite a while, I have never been able to experience the ""wet"" side of research. Besides, I like mocking Kristian for the late-night stays in the lab way too much. Banana bread & coffee, anything else is a compromise.
30px Malgorzata Futyma
Hi! My name is Gosia, I study Biotechnology at DTU. I joined iGEM team because I think it is a great experience to work with dedicated people interested in science. I want to learn more about synthetic biology, gain new skills and experience. I want to apply my lab experience in our project. My interests focus mainly on microbiology, Lactic Acid Bacteria, molecular biology and dairy products manufacturing. I like animals and plants, especially orchids and bonsai trees art. My cake is cheesecake.
30px Jakob Berg Jespersen
I am studying Advanced and Applied Chemistry with a focus in an area a little different: Computational Biology. I joined the iGEM team, to have a good excuse to do some wet lab work, while having the fun of doing a project over the summer. I like structural biology, and can spend hours in Pymol. I like setting up computational solutions, and will try to integrate structural biology in a protein-protein database search algorithm as my Master Thesis. In my free time, I enjoy simple sports such as running and swimming. My favorite kind of cake includes many blueberries and lots of chocolate.
30px Vanessa Jurtz
Hi my name is Vanessa and I study systems biology at DTU. I am especially interested in the mathematical modelling of biological systems. I think iGEM is a great opportunity to gain experience. I like to spend my free time outdoors and enjoy beeing so close to the beach here in Copenhagen. My favourite cake is Schwarzwälder Kirschtorte.
Anastasia Mourka
Hi all! I am a MSc student in Computer Science and Engineering at DTU, while my first degree was in Electrical and Computer Engineering at AUTH. My Biology knowledge is left back in high school, but I have a personal interest in creating websites. Therefore, I decided to join the iGEM team! Apart from that, I like working as a member of a big project and meeting new people! I enjoy dancing Latin and traditional Greek dances and my favorite cake is chocolate cake! The more the chocolate, the better the cake!
Natalia Papargyri
I have a bachelor degree in Chemistry, but I was always fascinated by biology! ..And now here I am, studying Systems Biology at DTU and being part of this year's iGEM team! I joined the team because I believe that learning by doing is the best way to really gain new skills and have a better understanding of the field of your interest, and of course is more fun!! It is also my first time working in a team at university level, with people having different backgrounds, and cultures, something that makes this experience all the more valuable to me! My favorite cake is…well, whatever has chocolate! :)
Julia Villarroel
I’m doing my M.Sc. in Systems Biology. I joined the iGEM team because I wanted to take active part in a research group (a really special one :-)) and because I wanted to spend the summer holidays working and having fun with wonderful people. Although I enjoy the wet lab, lately I’m getting more and more interested in bioinformatics. For me computers are still mysterious machines that perform some kind of magic but  we managed to reach a level of cooperation. During my free time I love dancing, especially salsa and other Latin dances. I also enjoy practicing yoga and swimming. My favorite cake is Gulerodskage, carrot cake.
30px Henrike Zschach
I'm following the Systems Biology study line at DTU. I joined the iGEM team to learn about how to see a project through from the beginning to the end and also to gain a deeper understanding of synthetic biology. My scientific interest is in the area of bioinformatics. My favorite cake is chocolate cake.

Advisors
Ali Altıntaş
I am a PhD student in the Department of Systems Biology, Technical University of Denmark and also a member of Regulatory Genomics group of the department. My original profession is on molecular biology, genetics and systems biology; besides, I have been improving my skills on computational biology and bioinformatics during my PhD. Thus, my life is a purgatory between lab and computer, when I am not playing drums or football. The lab had been so lonely before iGEM hard-workers were there and I am kind of sad that there will not be as many people around any more.
30px Anne Mathilde Lund
Anne Mathilde Lund is a PhD student, who loves to spend time in front of all of her computers to elucidate the fantastic gene expression profiles of Chinese Hamster Ovary cell lines. Mathilde's main interests are in the fields of mammalian cell technology, innovative cloning techniques and fashion design. She is just as passionate about her shoe collection as she is about her discoveries in the mammalian lab. Mathilde was part of the DTU iGEM team 2011, and has been a valuable advisor for this years iGEM team for which she has contributed with her extensive knowledge and experience in molecular cloning techniques.
Sébastien Muller
I am a post-doctorate in the group of Regulatory Genomics led by Christopher Workman. I have been trained in Molecular Biology and I have a particular fascination for the world of non-coding RNAs. Since 10 years I am focusing on the characterization of different species of non-coding RNAs and their involvement in diseases. Here, my aim is to identify new non-coding RNA candidates playing important roles in the genesis of diabetes.
30px Andreas Porse
I am a master student with a broad (and deep) interest in biotechnological research, which is why I use most of my spare time in the lab. My main interests are in the fields of (medical) microbial biotechnology, biodiversity and bioinformatics, although I’m always curious about getting new angles or using an array of scientific disciplines if relevant in solving an interesting problem. Therefore I love to help out in ambitious projects were many aspects of biology are involved, and where I might be able to contribute with my relevant experience - which is why I appreciate my role in this iGEM project.
30px Julie Rank

DNA order optimization and ordering
Most of our parts had to be created by IDT in 500 bp blocks that were then gibson assembled.
Joe Rokicki: Thanks for ordering the gblocks, designing how the blocks would be assembled along with head and tail sequences and doing a huge amount of work in checking the accuracy of the order and labeling all the features.
William Heymann: For writing the MATLAB code used to figure out the sequences that would go in each block to make sure that each piece spanned as few pieces as possible and for codon optimizing all the sequences.
In order to create this order we used the following pieces of software and we wish to thank the creators
MATLAB: The global optimizer is a truly amazing tool
Gene Designer: This tool proved to be very useful for codon optimization and the company was very helpful
UGENE: We used this program to identify the features in all of our sequences and to later verify all the parts we sent off for sequencing.
Researching and finding the correct sequences to order
This is something that all of the students and faculty advisors worked on pretty equally. We found these sequences before we started any of the lab work over the summer.
Thanks to the following people for checking the DNA sequence and AA sequences (after they where codon optimized) in order to ensure order accuracy.

iGEM Japan Meet up 2013
On August, 25, we held the “iGEM Japan Meet up” in our university and invited the iGEM teams in Japan. In this year, these following 7 Japanese teams participated in this event.
UT-Tokyo
Kyoto
Tokyo_Tech
Tokyo-NoKoGen
HokkaidoU_Japan (They participated in Skype)
TUPLS-Tokyo (They are going to participate in the iGEM in 2014.)
TMU-Tokyo (Host)
We planned this event because we wanted to make the opportunity of information sharing among Japanese teams. Also we wanted to make the opportunity to communicate with other teams.
In this event, each team gave about 20 minutes presentation about their project. And after finish the presentation, we followed with a question and answer period. Many people asked positively a lot of questions to presenters and it was a good opportunity to get objective opinions for their projects.
After the all teams except TUPLS-Tokyo finish their presentation, we offered some foods, drinks, and snacks to them. We really enjoyed and had a good time to communicate with other teams. We believe that participants enjoyed too.
We’ll keep this connection with the other Japanese team as long as possible.
Contribution to ""TUPLS-Tokyo""
We have supported a new iGEM team from Tokyo University of Pharmacy and Life Sciences, “TUPLS-Tokyo”. This team was established     in 2013, and they are going to participate in the iGEM competition in 2014.
In June, we knew that some students of Tokyo University of Pharmacy and Life Sciences established new iGEM team. In order to support the team, we held a meeting on June 30 and invited them to our university. Before this meeting, we received a lot of question about our team and our project from them. So we made the document which has the answers to their questions. We also guided our experiment space and let them show our laboratory instrument and experimental protocol. Additionally, We invited them to the iGEM Japan Meeting that was held in our university.  As a result, they became able to have a lot of connection with other iGEM teams in Japan.
Tokyo University of Pharmacy and Life Sciences is in the place that is very near to our university, so we intend to continue the support to TUPLS-Tokyo as far as possible.  Finally, we put up a comment from TUPLS-Tokyo’s team leader, Mr. Mezawa.
Tokyo Metropolitan University iGEM team, TMU-Tokyo was giving us a lot of support for development of our team.
On June 30, we participated in the meeting that held at Tokyo Metropolitan University. In this meeting, TMU-Tokyo gave us the        document in which they wrote the detailed answers to our questions. This document were useful and we came to understand how we        should run our team, how we get a fund, and so on. Also we could observe their experiment facilities.
Also we were invited iGEM Japan Meet up held at Tokyo Metropolitan University on August 25. In this meeting, many Japanese iGEM       teams participated and we were able to have a lot of connection with them. TMU-Tokyo team is our important supporter, and we want       them to continue to support us.
From        TUPLS-Tokyo’s team leader Yoshihiro Mezawa
Interchange with Macquarie_University team
Some of our team members visited Australia in March, 2013. And we had a relationship with Macquarie_Australia team.
We had a look around the university’s laboratory and held the exchange meeting. In the meeting, we talked about the current progress of each team’s projects. It was a great opportunity for us to have a communication with iGEMers of Macquarie University.

All of the experimental work described herein was performed by the team with technical support from Prof. Ellison’s technician, Nien-tsu Tseng (Rick). The TSP concept was inspired by the Missouri-Davidson 2007 iGEM team who broke the ice with their work on the Hamiltonian variation of TSB problem. The experimental approaches used here evolved over discussions with our supervisors during group meetings. The correct weighting algorithm that relates city path lengths to linker concentrations was developed by Dr. Doug Ridgway, a supervisor of the 2012 iGEM team. The plasmids used to create TSB compatible parts by PCR were a gift from Genomikon Inc .  The creation of the violacin bricks that we will use in the test of the 5-city TSB would not have been possible without the violacein operon biobrick (K274002) that was created, submitted and carefully characterized by the Cambridge 2009 iGEM team. Wiki coding and design implementation was done by Timo Hohn, (B.Sc. in Computer Engineering).
Thanks to these individuals for donating their time and talents!

Mike Ellison
Mike Ellison is a professor with the Department of Biochemistry at the University of             Alberta.
His current focus on Synthetic Biology is to produce modular biological circuits of            increasing sophistication using well-understood molecular components that can be            reliably assembled into novel and useful forms of artificial life. He has been involved           in iGEM for six years and continues to actively engage his undergraduate students            in this synthetic biology competition.
Dominic Sauvageau
Dominic Sauvageau joined the Department of Chemical and Materials            Engineering at the University of Alberta            as an Assistant Professor in January 2011. His research involves the development of novel bacteriophage-           based technologies and bioprocessing strategies for production in microbial systems. He joined the iGEM            adventure last year when he supervised an iGEM-Entrepreneurial team (they won!). He's thrilled to be            involved in iGEM again this year. He loves travelling and hopes he'll be able to use the E. coli we're            working on to plan his next trip.
Mark Rozema
Mark Rozema graduated from the Biochemistry program at the University of Alberta in April 2013 and is            currently enrolled in the law program, also at the U of A. He enjoys running, early mornings, late nights            and old scotch. Mark was involved in all facets of the project over the summer months, such as conceptual            planning, establishing general protocol, part creation and part isolation but withdrew to focus on law            school since the start of September.
Cadence Moorhouse
I am a 4th year genetics student at the University of Alberta. Every since high school I have had an            interest in genetics and I heard all about the applications of synthetic biology largely through social            media. It was at a talk by biotech guru Andrew Hessel that I first learned of iGEM. I was delighted to find            out that the U of A had a team and a couple of emails later I was on the roster. This project has given me            the opportunity to learn standard lab techniques and to see an experiment evolve. My experience teaching and            coaching allows me to easily convey complex ideas into simpler ones. I hope to utilize these skills over the            course of this project.  
Dawson Zeng
I am a 4th year student at the University of Alberta majoring in Biological Sciences. I first heard about             the field of Synthetic Biology from a guest speaker. It was then that I looked into joining iGEM Team             Alberta. Personally, I think it is the coolest thing that Synthetic Biology combines philosophies from both             Biology and Engineering; something I never thought about. Overall, my knowledge and understanding of             genetics and interactions between DNA molecules vastly increased throughout the summer. A true testament to             Richard Feynman’s famous quote, “What I cannot create, I do not understand.”
Michael Esau
I am a graduate from the Biochemistry Specialization program at the University of  Alberta. I learned about iGEM from Dr. Mike Ellison’s biochemistry class, and am  happy to be a part of this year’s team. I'm planning to go into the synthetic bio  research field and will be joining up with Dr. Dominic Sauvageau's lab for the next  year.
Rachel Kwan
After my first discoveries on the possibilities of iGEM from the local newspaper, I searched online and admired various iGEM projects. At this time during high school, I was personally unclear of my desired career path, aside from studying science, with a focus on Biology or Chemistry. Also with my vague knowledge of biotechnological methods, I was wary about the bioethical side of “manipulating nature,” especially from public warnings in literature.
However, within studying Biochemistry in my undergrad, I found that current methodologies of biotechnology seemed to have controlled lab settings, careful precautions, and/or a balance with purposeful benefits. Looking at the variety of iGEM projects, they used in-school material for real-world, practical applications. IGEM also attracted me because I liked the idea of working in a team setting to balance strengths and weaknesses with others. I believe that iGEM is rewarding and relevant in that it challenges teamwork, independence, creativity, writing, presenting, and lab technique. As part of my work, I hope to offer organizational skills, interest in safety, and Wiki ideas.
Outside of iGEM work, I play the piano and clarinet, read, meditate, play board games, search for good sales, and grow pet plants like basil.
Stephanie Chiu
I am a first year student at the University of Alberta. I first heard about iGEM from friends at my high            school and was privileged enough to join U of A’s team as I was finishing up my Grade 12 year. I am excited            to learn more about what synthetic biology is and what working in a lab is like. I hope that I can offer a            unique perspective to our team.
Larry Zhang
Passionate scientist born in the historical city of Yueyang, China; educated in the English for 8 years and             has been under strict scientific indoctrination in the University of Alberta department of Biochemistry.             Graduated with a Biochemistry degree with interest in genetics and genetic engineering, Larry Zhang has             brought with him a huge idea cannon and a pair of magic pipetter’s hands; he is one of the most valuable             assets in this team.
Cameron Murray
I am a first year university student studying molecular genetics at the U of A, however when I joined the             team I was in my grade twelve year of high school. I heard about Synthetic biology through quirks and             quarks, the CBC radio program, and was immediately taken with it and it’s vast possibilities. I was so             enthralled that I talked about it quite a bit to my friends one of whom told me about iGEM. So here I am             hoping to learn about and deepen my interest in synthetic biology through iGEM.

Dr. Allison Phillips
I am interested in exploring how seeds develop and I use maize as a model system. The goals of my research are to determine genes and factors which influence seed development and to specifically determine the contribution of the maternal parent to this process. My research integrates techniques in genetics, molecular biology, cell biology and plant physiology to answer this central question.
I am also interested in working with undergraduates to develop curriculum materials to share Biology and Plant Science with younger students and the wider community. It is an awesome way to integrate science research, teaching, and civic engagement and share the wonder and beauty of plant science with others.
Dr. James Henkel
I am interested in pathogenic organisms and what factors allow them to become pathogenic, especially bacterial toxins.  I use Chlamydia trachomatis infections in mammalian cells to determine how the chlamydia re-directs trafficking proteins from normal cellular functions for the bacteria’s reproduction and metabolism.  My research involves microbiology, biochemistry, cell biology, and many molecular biological techniques.  Currently, I am investigating the re-localization of small GTPases to the membrane wall, called the inclusion, which surrounds the chlamydia.
Dr. Jarrod Erbe
One of my research interests is the use of microorganisms for the detection and quantization of phosphorus in environmental samples. As a member of the Phosphorus Research Group at WLC, I hope to develop microbial phosphate biosensors that will result in a standardized, environmentally friendly alternative for the determination of phosphate concentration in soil samples. I am also interested in determining the types of microbes that form specific biomes. I am currently using ribosomal RNA and other target gene sequences to identify the various species present in the biome associated with an engineered wetland wastewater treatment system.
Dr. John Werner
My research has focused on trying to identify the mechanisms by which bacteria maintain order in their cells. In graduate school I studied the pathway by which an antibiotic resistance mechanism assembles in Escherichia coli. As a postdoc, I utilized high-throughput methods to determine where hundreds of proteins reside inside the cell of Caulobacter crescentus. Most recently, I have been interested in characterizing the bacterial cytoskeletal proteins. Cytoskeletal proteins are necessary for cells to properly divide and maintain their shape. When these proteins do not function correctly cells become misshapen and many cellular processes are directly or indirectly disrupted.

The Team
Nick Goldner
Nicholas is a senior biochemistry and philosophy major. He is currently applying to graduate schools and plans to obtain his doctorate in either biochemistry or molecular biology. In his free time he enjoys hiking, camping slacklineing and working in the lab. His favorite protocol is the DNA ligation and his favorite part is “The One Ring to Secrete Them All” because it means we actually finished the project. Cheesehead Dave’s Are his favorite lab gloves to wear even though they are no longer in production: he has a box of XL’s stashed away. The greatest song ever played was the entire movie “Dune” the 1986 version that started playing during shuffle. Apparently we only had the audio for the entire movie.
Nicholas served the function of team leader and primary lab techniques trainer. He is the founder and camp director of the Synthetic Biology Summer Camp. He is an integral part in the design process, assembly, troubleshooting and characterization of ""The One Ring to Secrete Them All"". He aided writing the security and safety information and,   identified the necessary information for background research regarding human outreach. He also helped to establish a collaboration with MSOE-Milwaukee iGEM team.
Benjamin Tellier
Benjamin Tellier is a senior Biochemistry major with aspirations of becoming a doctor in the future.  He has learned throughout the course of the project to split his time between studying for school and the MCAT, and his time spent working on the project.  Ben, along with Nicholas Goldner, has performed research in Infectious Disease microbiology in the past and thought that the use of his talents for humanitarian purposes would not be ill-placed.  Ben enjoys the simple things in life: protein shakes, power lifting, wrestling, and cinematic adventures.
If you were to ask Ben what his favorite part of working in the lab is he would probably respond that he enjoys differential media assays, the smell of fresh 70% ethanol solutions, and just about any protocol that he can do while listening to Hardstyle techno.
Over the course of this project Ben utilized his talents for the research and development of culture medias for differentiation and selection of the bacteria used throughout the project. Ben shared his knowledge of genetics as a lecturer during the summer camp. He also was a ever-present member in the lab (along with Nick Goldner) so he had ample opportunities to help with many aspects of the project.
Steven Van Alstine
Steven Van Alstine is a junior at Wisconsin Lutheran College pursuing a biochemistry major.  As a founding member of the iGEM team he hopes to continue the iGEM team in future years.  Steve is considering going onto graduate school to further his career in the realm of synthetic biology.  In his free time he enjoys disc golfing and fishing.  Steve’s favorite protocol is the transformation of plasmids into competent cells.  His favorite part is BBa_J04450 since you can always tell when the colonies you have are correctly transformed.  Steve typically likes listening to either epic music or hardstyle while in the lab. Steve is excited about iGEM this year and eager to see the outcome.
Steven Van Alstine was an active participant in the laboratory work throughout the project.  He was also responsible for the safety portion of the project.  This included interviews with two of the professors on campus about safety in academia and industry as well as safety with handling genetically engineered organisms in being conscious of a world that has the potential for biowarfare. Steve corresponded with a nutritionist to gain a better understanding of the use of the project in the context of human gut health.
Rachel Nolte
Rachel is in her final year as a chemistry major. Her on-campus job is team lead for the science hall workers, mainly working in the chemistry stockroom. She plans to work as a lab tech or assistant after college for 1-2 years before attending grad school for a PhD.

Rachel contributed to background information, future directions, and gene function. She also worked in the lab.
Her favorite protocols generally involve bunsen burners, fume hoods, and/or the infrared spectrometer. The pigmented BBa_K274002 is one of her favorite parts because purple is a pretty sweet color. The minty scent of the paraffin repellent is her favorite smell in the lab. Her favorite gloves are the black ones given to the iGEM team by the coolest janitor ever. Just about any song from Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog or the song from Portal ""Still Alive"" are her favorite lab theme songs/world domination anthems.
Matthew Mortensen
Matt is a sophomore biochemistry major. He joined iGEM  to gain experience with lab techniques. He is undecided about future plans. In his free time, Matt enjoys rock climbing, reading comic books, and gaming. His favorite protocol is Miniprep. His favorite part is ""yesZ"" because it is easy to remember. CardinalHealth powder-free Nitrile gloves are his favorite. The greatest song ever played in lab is ""How Long Will They Mourn Me.""
Matt often found himself doing basic lab protocols such as mini-preps, transformations, ligations, digestions... He also used what skills he had to make the wiki you are currently on. In addition to being a lab minion and wikimaster, Matt also served as the main camera-man (both videos and stills) for the Summer Camp.
Sierra Tackett
Sierra Tackett is a sophomore Biochemistry major who plans on using her degree to advance to medical school in interest of being a pathologist in the future. She joined iGEM in order to deepen her understanding of biology as well as gain experience in research. In her free time, she enjoys to golf and look for frogs at a pond nearby. Her favorite protocol is mini prep, and she enjoys the smell of N3 buffer. She can often be seen wearing size medium Esteem gloves, and jamming to “How Long Will They Mourn Me.”
Sierra was a communications director and group leader at the science summer camp. She then delved into the lab, and performed mini preps, ligations, restriction digests, and ran electrophoresis gels, or whatever needed to be done in-between those processes. Sierra coordinated the background research for the iGEM project, focusing on things like GMOs and their implications on the world.
Logan Friedrich
Logan Friedrich is a Junior Biochemistry major planning on a doctorate who joined iGem in 2012 to continue enhancing his lab and biological research skills. He loves music and is in a band and several choirs. Logan enjoys running agarose and SDS PAGE gels. The smell of a Bunsen burner ignited is all that it takes to get him excited. He uses extra-large gloves and listens to Scientist by Flux Pavilion while working in the lab. Logan was responsible for compiling every single protocol that an iGEM team had on their wikipage since the wiki pages started. He also contributed to the overall angst of the lab.
Anna Garvey
Anna is in her sophomore year as a Biology major. She aspires to one day receive her M.D./Ph.D. In her medical career she plans on specializing in cardiothoracic surgery.  In addition, she hopes to conduct stem-cell research in relation to the heart and brain. Through-out her life she always wanted to be a part of something that has the potential to better people’s realities, shape societies, affect cultures, and change the world. For these reasons she joined iGEM. In addition, she thought it would be a wonderful way to experience novel research first-hand and meet individuals that shared the same passion for science as she did. In the lab, her favorite protocol is the Restriction Digest Protocol, her favorite lab smell is ethanol and sharpies, and she enjoys listening to the thug life album.  Outside of school, and lab work Anna enjoys reading and writing novels and short stories. She dreams to one day be a published author.
Anna was a group leader in the 2013 iGEM summer camp. In the lab she contributed to lab work by preforming PCR, mini preps, electroporations, ligations, digestions, and mathematical calculations that were coupled with those procedures. In addition, she researched and designed all the graphs used in the background research.
Arlensiu Novelli
Arlensiu Novelli was born and raised in Venezuela and moved to Milwaukee in 2008. She is a Communicative Arts major with emphasis in PR and Digital Cinema and Media minor graduating on May 2014. She plans to work with PR after graduation, but hopes to work on more little projects in the cinema industry, main reason she joined the iGem team. She loves dancing/teaching salsa. Arlen was responsible for helping coordinate the editing and filming of the summer camp.
Jack Albert
Jack Albert is double majoring in both a Digital Cinema and Media major (DCM) and also an English major. He is currently a junior on track to graduate in May of 2015. He joined iGem because he has an interest in covering a wide variety of topics via filmmaking, but also because he enjoys helping people. He plans on working in or around a film studio in the near future, if he doesn't decide to go independent from the start. His hobbies include running, singing, and Super Smash Bros.
As lead video producer, Jack oversaw the execution of recording, storage, and management of videos. He also organized and ran the editing process on the videos as they were being finalized. He conducted interviews used in the project and helped with the scheduling for his editing team and the delivery of the finalized videos.
Kendalyn Thoma
Kendalyn Thoma is a junior majoring in biology. She joined the IGEM team to advance her biology lab skills and learn research procedures in order to do her own research in the future. She plans on attending graduate school to study forestry and water ecology. Making linearized plasmid backbones is her favorite protocol while listening to Dr. Horrible Sing-Along songs. The smell of fresh medium size lab gloves is her favorite lab smell. Kendalyn was responsible for public outreach and helped in the summer camp fulfilling the role of lab manager. She also wrote article to be placed in the school news paper much to the consternation of more religious members of the school.
Jessica Zaher
Jessica Zaher is a senior and a Psychology major. She plans to go to graduate school for her Master's degree in forensic psychology. She hopes to one day work for the FBI. Jessica joined iGEM and the WLC team to lend a hand finding a survey and doing the analysis while also getting more experience working on a team. Her favorite hobby, when the time allows, is reading.
Jessica's job was to initially create a survey, geared toward the summer camp and assess the students attitudes toward science before and after participating the the camp. Instead of creating a survey, something that would be unreliable as far as analysis goes, she found a known and reliable survey that assessed attitudes toward science. After the summer camp and once the surveys were collected, Jessica used SPSS (a statistical analysis program) to enter the data and run the frequency statistics on the demographic questions of the survey.
Christa Winslow
Christa Winslow plans to graduate with a biochemistry major and a mathematics minor in 2016. She hopes to attend graduate school and have a career working in a lab and doing genetic research. Christa joined iGem to get more experience in research and to push her scientific knowledge and skills in an enjoyable, non-classroom setting. When she is not engaged in the lab, Christa enjoys sketching nature or sitting down with a good novel in her spare hours.
Christa Winslow was an active member of the team. Her primary role involved researching and composing the ethical component of the project.She also contributed to the project directly by working in the lab as well.

University of Calgary Support
The University of Calgary iGEM team would like to thank and acknowledge all of the support from the University in terms of student stipends, support personnel, facilities, and materials which made this project possible.  The O'Brien Centre for the Bachelor of Health Sciences provided the laboratories we worked in this summer and allowed us to continue our work even into the fall term.  Additionally, a special thanks to the Faculty of Medicine and Schulich School of Engineering for their financial support.
Advisor and Instructor Support
All research work was performed by the undergraduate students on our team.  Our professors and advisors contributed support and ideas to the students and facilitated a safe and efficient laboratory environment.  Special thanks to Dr. Anders Nygren and Dr. Mayi Arcellana Panlilio for their continuous support in organizing the logistics of this team despite their busy schedule. Big thank you to Dr. Anthony Schryvers, an advisor, whose technical know-how helped us troubleshoot our assays. Special thanks to Jamie Fegan, for helping us troubleshoot our protein expression. We would also like to thank Cesar Rodriguez from Autodesk who provided valuable advise with both the 3D-modeling component of the project as well as the mathematical model. Thank you to Dr. Mark Bieda for advising us in the fall semester and facilitating O’Brien Center Lab space for our team.  We also would like to thank Kate Chatfeld-Reed for her input and advice on our project throughout the year. Additionally we wish to extend our thanks to David Lloyd, Emily Hicks and Margaret Renaud-Young for advice and thoughts on completing our project. Finally, special thanks to Jeff Wintersinger for lending his expertise and time to build the biosensor database SensiGEM.
Support From Additional Professors and University Staff
We would like to acknowledge other professors in the Faculty of Medicine including Dr. Mark Ungrin and Dr. Glen Armstrong (for meeting with us and providing expert advice on the general direction of the project). Additionally, Dr. Glen Armstrong is the E. coli O157:H7 expert we are collaborating with to acquire EHEC E. coli DNA to test and characterize our final system. Additionally, we would like to thank Dr. Mark Anikovski and Dr. Tom Swaddle from the Department of Chemistry for providing us valuable feedback on the ferritin subproject.
We also extend our gratitude to the SACRI Research Group and the Schryvers Lab for their donation of chemicals. We would also like to thank Dr. Cairine Logan for being the designated safety assignee in the fall semester.   Additionally, we would like to thank Dr. Howard Ceri and Carol Stremick
for access to specific reagents. Furthermore, we would like to thank Nicholas Jette
for his advice on the electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Lastly, we wish to thank Dr. Joseph Lemire for providing us with valuable feedback and comments on our overall system.
Outside of University Research and Technical Support
We would like to thank and acknowledge the support of various individuals from outside sources.  This includes Chad Laing from the University of Lethbridge for sharing his expertise about EHEC genomes and conservation profile of EHEC E. coli to ultimately allow us to decide target sequences for our TALEs. We would also like to thank Donna Douey, the National Manager of Food Microbiology Lab Programs at the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA), for giving us insight into the current protocols and standards used by the CFIA and valuable advice regarding our project.
Outside of University Additional Support
We would like to thank the individuals who we had requested to do interviews with Dr. Bob Church including a prominent Alberta rancher, researcher and expert who has transferred genetic technologies into livestock. We would also like to thank Dr. Eric Behlke (Feedlot Health Management Services), Ryan Clisdell (Cargill Meat Solutions), Rick Sears (Chinook feeders), Rick Culbert and Susan Goebel (Bioniche), and Nancy Burgess (US Defense Threat Reduction Agency).  We would also like to thank Gabe Patin for his resources in making 3D print outs of our FerriTALE system.

Our Team
This year we have a very diverse team of people, with individuals in all years of study, and from varying faculties across campus. Our team consists of undergraduates, graduate students, professors, and advisors, who have all come together to create our FerriTALE. Each team member worked on a separate aspect of our project. There was a team for our detector , reporter , linker , modeling , prototype , and human practices . Some of us dedicated our time to one part of our project, while others tried their hand at everything. Each team member brought their own skills and knowledge, and sacrificed their time to make our FerriTALE become a reality. To get to know each team member and their contributions, click here . There are lots of ways to get in contact with us; try clicking on one of the links below to email us, go to our Twitter, Facebook, or our university website!

Developing Our Team
In order to achieve our goals and develop FREDsense, we required a diverse background of skill sets. Seven members of the 2012 Calgary iGEM team joined forces to become part of the FREDsense team. Our skills represent a variety of technical specialities ranging from genetics, biochemistry, and microbiology to electrochemistry. To ensure our venture's success, we enlisted the aid of technical, business, and legal experts to our advisory board. This has aided in producing a dynamic team that will be able to deliver on FREDsense's goals and bring our technology to market.
Building the FREDsense Team
Our team is composed of seven students from diverse technical backgrounds, all who were members of the 2012 Calgary Collegiate iGEM team where this technology platform was initially developed from. To suppliment our skills we have also enlisted the aid of several key advisors from diverse technical, business, and legal backgrounds to sit on our advisory board and act to guide FREDsense Technologies as it develops.
Team Members
Our team consists of seven members from diverse technical backgrounds. Each member played a critical role in developing the technology from the 2012 Calgary iGEM team and has played a significant role in playing multiple roles in business development of FREDsense Technologies.
Iain George
This is my second year on our iGEM team at the University of Calgary. I am a master student in biological sciences at the U of C. My research is in investigating how RNA-binding proteins act to regulate various genes at the post-transcriptional level. Previously, I worked as a member of the Biofilm Research Group at the U of C, studying how bacterial biofilms could be applied to bioremediate environmentally contaminated sites. When I am not living/sleeping/supervising in the lab, you may find me in the mountains surrounding Calgary hiking and trying my hand at photography.
Emily Hicks
This is my fifth summer in iGEM, which probably means that I really, really need to get a life.  This summer I am looking forward to stepping outside the lab and tackling an entrepreneurial project. I am incredibly excited to see what we discover and hopefully see our FRED project from last year move into the real world. I’ll no doubt still be enjoying the late nights in the lab, but will hopefully be able to gain a good perspective on the business side of things. In my spare time I enjoy beating David at flight control, collecting stuffed pandas as well as taking drinks from my favourite water fountain in the Health Sciences Centre.
David Lloyd
This is my fifth year being involved in iGEM in which time I have had the opportunity to work with the Alberta team for two years as an undergraduate, two years as a team advisor for Calgary Collegiate, and now with the Calgary Entrepreneurial Team. I have completed a BSc and MSc in Biochemistry and now am pursuing the FREDsense Technologies venture full time. I am very passionate for using my synthetic biology experience as a manager, entreprenuer, and educator and hope to merge these passions into an exciting career in the future. iGEM has been an amazing opportunity and I greatly look forward to another year in the competition!
Robert Mayall
I have just graduated with my Bachelors degree from the University of Calgary. This is my third year being involved with iGEM, and my first trip into the entrepreneurial category. I was heavily involved in the technical design of FRED and am the electrochemist for our group. I will continue my technical role as a member of FREDsense Technologies by focusing on the development of our platform technology.
Lisa Oberding
I graduated recently from the University of Calgary with a degree in Cellular, Molecular, and Microbial Biology, and am now pursuing my M.Sc. in Petroleum Microbiology. This is my second year with iGEM, which I got involved with as a chance to gain more research experience, learn about synthetic biology, and further define my research interests. I was involved last year with developing the sensor element of FRED, however moving forward with FREDsense I have found myself taking on more of a business focused role. I find that I am enjoying the experience of learning a completely foreign skill-set as well as getting to see science and research from a completely new direction.
Maggie Renaud-Young
I am in my fifth year of the Biochemistry and Molecular Biology PhD program in the Southern Alberta Cancer Biology Research Group at the University of Calgary. The focus of my studies is the cellular response to obstructed DNA replication, and how disturbances to this process contribute to genome instability using the budding yeast model system. This is the third year that I have worked with iGEM but different from the past two years I am not an adviser, and the project is less about the bio and all about the business. It is has been a great experience for me to see the world from this perspective and I look forward to a future in research and development of a product I had a part in creating. The rest of my team and I hope that this is the launchpad for a successful business and we are excited about this opportunity to present our plan in this competition.
Patrick Wu
I am currently doing my Masters of Biomedical Technology at the University of Calgary. This is my fourth year as a participant of the iGEM competition, but my contributions this year are primarily towards construction of the Entrepreneurial team wiki.

Wm. Keith van der Meulen
Electrical & Computer Engineering (2nd Year)
This summer, I have been responsible for building the physical prototypes for our system and designing and coding this website. I am pursuing a career in aeronautical robotics R&D, so I have found my time working in a research setting with iGEM this year very valuable. Besides staying up until 2 a.m. coding, I also spend my time running Foster Bikes , a non-profit, Seattle-based company I co-founded. In my free time, I enjoy hiking, backpacking, skiing, and trying to learn about this weird thing non-engineers call a ""social life"".

Chris Wintersinger
Biomedical Sciences (4th Year)
This is my second year on the iGEM Calgary team and I have my hands in every part of the project. Formally though, I am leading team ferritin and have been nicknamed ""Christoferritin"" by my team mates. When I am not slaving in the early morning hours in our lab, you'll find me travelling on remote logging roads in the backwoods of Alberta, or covered in grease working on my pickup truck. After I conquer iGEM, I hope to start a career as a hand model, enter a travelling carnival, or failing those, continue my journey in synthetic biology as a graduate student.

Robert Mayall
Biochemistry & Molecular Biology (Recent Alumni)
This is my third year in iGEM, and I am one of the advisors to the team this year. That means I get to yell slightly more than I did in previous years. When I'm not sitting around in a lab, I can be found swimming laps in a nearby pool or catching up on some of the sleep I lost during wiki freeze from the last few years. One day I want to grow up and face the real world, but I will put that off as long as possible by going to grad school.

Taylor Remondini
Cellular, Molecular, & Microbial Biology (4th Year)
This is my first year with the iGEM Calgary team and I have been involved primarily with the ferritin , linker , and wiki design elements of the project. My main interest has been in testing the potential of chemically modified ferritin nano-particles as a reporter system for our project. Between working in the lab and harassing Keith about the design of the wiki you can find me on the golf course or ensuring that my car is spotless. Going into the future I am pursuing entrance into medical school to further my career. iGEM has been an invaluable experience for many of the trials I will face going forward with life.
Denny Hoang
Cellular, Molecular, & Microbial Biology (4th Year)
This is my first year in the iGEM team and I've largely played a role in the ferritin part of the team. I've been previously exposed in a lab involving environmental microbiology, thus this experience has given me the opportunity learn many different techniques and skills used in synthetic biology.  In my spare time I've enjoyed playing soldier, snowboarding and reading novels.

Ruth Moges
Biological Sciences (3rd Year)
This is my first year with iGEM. I've mostly been helping out the undergrad supervisors with their arbitrary needs, so I've been a part of the TALEs, Ferritin and Linker teams. I've loved the opportunity to work in a lab, this is my first year doing so independently. Later in life I hope to become an optometrist, looking into people's eyes is one of my favourite pastimes. When not in the lab though, I am doing other fun activities like reading, hanging out with my friends and soaking up as much vitamin D as I can before winter comes!

Justin Dole
Biological Sciences (2nd Year)
Heading into my second undergraduate year, I can undoubtedly say that the past few months have helped put my academic knowledge into context. I held various roles this summer, but was ultimately in charge of qualitative modelling using Autodesk Maya. This has been my first year with iGEM; the exposure to various disciplines has allowed me to see the interconnectivity between synthetic biology, engineering, and business. Besides waiting for the lab computer to process 22GB of RAM, I take pride in eating well, exercising regularly, sleeping in, and picking flowers for my Mom. I two-strap my backpack, have a keen interest in entrepreneurship, technology, and medicine, and love anything with an engine to the point that I consider myself obsessed.
Su Wang
Chemical Engineering (4th Year)
I am a chemical engineering student with a specialization in biomedical engineering. Prior to join iGEM I have been doing researches in chemical engineering labs for thermodynamics or in-situ oil upgrading. Those were professor-driven research projects where even though I had good experiences, there was little I could do to test my own hypothesis. That's why I came for iGEM; for the student driven research aspect. Here I wish to combine with what I have learned from system biology class, with my training in modelling, to work on things that interest me!
Sharon Feng
Biomedical Sciences (3rd Year)
This summer was my first year being involved in iGEM and a wet lab setting. I was fortunate to be a member of the TALEs team where I have learned so much about synthetic biology, bacterial genetics, and general lab practices. Last year, I was involved with clinical studies of children with inflammatory bowel disease at the Alberta Children's Hospital. In my free time, I enjoy reading novels, watching movies, and spending time with family and friends.
Amanda Zucoloto
Biomedical Sciences (3rd Year)
This is my first year on iGEM and I have been working with TALEs, which involved alternative cloning strategies and lots of fun time doing protein work over the Summer. When I am not pippeting in the lab to the sound of Backstreet Boys, I spend my time working out, exploring Canada and catching up with family and friends who are all the way back in Brazil. Even though I still have a couple months here in Calgary, I can't wait to come back as a graduate student!
Julie Osgood
Biomedical Sciences (3rd Year)
This is my first year with iGEM and I have spent my summer focusing on the TALE aspect of our project. I devoted my time to designing the E. coli target sequences and putting together our TALE constructs. When I’m not redoing all my experiments that didn’t work, I enjoy dancing, reading, and watching Battestar Galactica. I have spent my past couple summers working in research labs, but I loved having the opportunity to join a student driven research team. In the future I hope to be a professional Quidditch player or a geneticist.

Iain George
Biological Sciences (2nd Year Masters)
This is my second year on our iGEM team at the University of Calgary.  I am a master student in biological sciences at the U of C. My research is in investigating how RNA-binding proteins act to regulate various genes at the post-transcriptional level. Previously, I worked as a member of the Biofilm Research Group at the U of C, studying how bacterial biofilms could be applied to bioremediate environmentally contaminated sites. When I am not living/sleeping/supervising in the lab, you may find me in the mountains surrounding Calgary hiking and trying my hand at photography.

This is my second year with iGEM, and this year I am involved with both Calgary teams. For this team I have been both an advisor as well as the laboratory technician. In addition to making about a billion plates and ordering supplies, I've helped out a bit on every section of the project as well as helping with work on the graphic design for the website. Outside of iGEM I enjoy scuba diving, snowboarding, camping, reading, and drawing, in addition to getting whatever small amount of sleep I can get.

Wm. Keith van der Meulen
Electrical & Computer Engineering (2nd Year)
This summer, I have been responsible for the designing and coding this website and working on the modeling part of the team. I am pursuing a career in aeronautical robotics R&D, so I have found my time working in a research setting with iGEM this year very valuable. Besides staying up until 2 a.m. coding, I also spend my time running Foster Bikes , a non-profit, Seattle-based company I co-founded. In my free time, I enjoy hiking, backpacking, skiing, and trying to learn about this weird thing non-engineers call a ""social life"".

Chris Wintersinger
Biomedical Sciences (4th Year)
This is my second year on the iGEM Calgary team and I have my hands in every part of the project. Formally though, I am leading the detector team and have been nicknamed ""Christoferritin"" by my team mates. When I am not slaving in the early morning hours in our lab, you'll find me travelling on remote logging roads in the backwoods of Alberta, or covered in grease working on my pickup truck. After I conquer iGEM, I hope to start a career as a hand model, enter a travelling carnival, or failing those, continue my journey in synthetic biology as a graduate student.

Somshukla (Rai) Chaudhuri
Biomedical Sciences (4th Year)
My name is Somshukla Chaudhuri but I mostly go by Rai, my family given nickname. This is my second year in iGEM and I am an undergraduate supervisor for the iGEM Calgary 2013 team. I will be graduating this year with a major in biomedical sciences and a minor in health and society. When I am not pulling all-nighters in the lab, I can usually be found reading, salsa dancing, jamming to some Bollywood music, or tearing up to sappy Bollywood movies. I am potentially addicted to caffeine and usually very sleep deprived. But, hey! Sleep is for the weak, right?

Robert Mayall
Biochemistry & Molecular Biology (Recent Alumni)
This is my third year in iGEM, and I am one of the advisors to the team this year. That means I get to yell slightly more than I did in previous years. When I'm not sitting around in a lab, I can be found swimming laps in a nearby pool or catching up on some of the sleep I lost during wiki freeze from the last few years. One day I want to grow up and face the real world, but I will put that off as long as possible by going to grad school.

Taylor Remondini
Cellular, Molecular, & Microbial Biology (4th Year)
This is my first year with the iGEM Calgary team and I have been involved primarily with the reporter , linker , and wiki design elements of the project. My main interest has been in testing the potential of chemically modified ferritin nano-particles as a reporter system for our project. Between working in the lab and harassing Keith about the design of the wiki you can find me on the golf course or ensuring that my car is spotless. Going into the future I am pursuing entrance into medical school to further my career. iGEM has been an invaluable experience for many of the trials I will face going forward with life.
Denny Hoang
Cellular, Molecular, & Microbial Biology (4th Year)
This is my first year in the iGEM team and I've largely played a role in the reporter part of the team. I've been previously exposed in a lab involving environmental microbiology, thus this experience has given me the opportunity learn many different techniques and skills used in synthetic biology.  In my spare time I've enjoyed playing soldier, snowboarding and reading novels.
Patrick Wu
Biomedical Technology (1st Year Masters)
After four years of undergrad (and three years of iGEM) I am now working on my Masters of Biomedical Technology here at the University of Calgary. This is now my fourth year as a part of iGEM, though I now act as a part-time advisor/consultant/distraction to the team. I am very excited to see how user-centered design can be applied to non-traditional fields like biology, and iGEM never disappoints me with all the cool ideas that come out. In my spare time, you can probably find me fiddling around with Photoshop and Illustrator, or asleep. Sleep is always nice.

Ruth Moges
Biological Sciences (3rd Year)
This is my first year with iGEM. I've mostly been helping out the undergrad supervisors with their arbitrary needs, so I've been a part of the TALEs, Ferritin and Linker teams. I've loved the opportunity to work in a lab, this is my first year doing so independently. Later in life I hope to become an optometrist, looking into people's eyes is one of my favourite pastimes. When not in the lab though, I am doing other fun activities like reading, hanging out with my friends and soaking up as much vitamin D as I can before winter comes!
Kate Chatfield-Reed
Biological Sciences (4th Year PhD)
This is my first year as an advisor for iGEM and my first year involved with iGEM in any capacity. I’ve been offering small pieces of advice over all areas of the project. When I finally finish my PhD I hope to stay in the wonderful world of academia forever. In my spare time I play soccer and hockey or read too much.
Jamie Fegan
Microbiology & Infectious Diseases (3rd Year PhD)
I am studying vaccine design and antigen engineering against the pathogen Neisseria meningitidis, the causative agent of meningococcal disease. As an iGEM newcomer, I’m amazed at how everyone functions on so little sleep, but I’m doing my best as I help with the protein expression and purification side of the project. When I’m not running in circles around the lab, I can be found playing volleyball or squash with friends, sliding down a mountain in an attempt at snowboarding, or hanging out at home with a glass of wine binge watching entire TV series with my cats.
Dr. Anders Nygren
Electrical & Biomedical Engineering (Professor)
I have a PhD from Rice University, Houston, Texas, and MSc degrees from the University of Houston, Texas and the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm, Sweden. I am an Associate Professor of Electrical & Computer Engineering and Co-Director of the Centre for Bioengineering Research & Education at the University of Calgary. I have a research background in computer modeling of biological and physiological systems and got involved in iGEM to learn about how computer modeling can be applied to Synthetic Biology. This is the fifth time I am involved as one of the facilitators for a U of C iGEM team.

Dr. Mark Bieda
Bioinformatics (Assistant Director)
My overall research areas are in bioinformatics and epigenetics. I’m particularly interested in roles of epigenetic modifications in controlling processes in neuroscience and cancer. Here, I use epigenetics in the “modern” sense (some would say incorrect sense) to refer to modifications of DNA and histones to control gene expression. I’d add in transcription factors here, too, with the risk of diluting epigenetic to just mean “transcriptional regulation”.
Dr. Anthony Schryvers
Microbiology, Immunology, & Infectious Diseases (Professor)
I obtained a PhD in Biochemistry at the University of Alberta and an MD at the University of Calgary. During my Postdoctoral training at U of C I also served a 2 1/2 year term as VP Research for Chembiomed.  During my first 17 years as a faculty member at the University of Calgary I was focused primarily on research. I have been involved in the Bachelor of Health Sciences program since its inception, and currently serve as Director of the Program and as Associate Dean, Undergraduate Science Education. I currently hold appointments in the Departments of Microbiology, Immunology & Infectious Diseases and Biochemistry & Molecular Biology in the Faculty of Medicine, and in the Department of Food Production Animal Health in the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine.
Dr. Cesar Rodriguez
Senior Research Scientist (AutoDesk, Inc.)
I am a Senior Research Scientist in the Bio/Nano/Programmable Matter group at Autodesk where I focus on computer-aided design of biological systems. Prior to joining Autodesk, I was the Synthetic Biology Research Lead at Genome Compiler and Software Lead at BIOFAB: International Open Facility Advancing Biotechnology (BIOFAB). I am a co-founder and former co-editor of the Synthetic Biology Open Language (SBOL), an emerging data exchange standard and have been an iGEM judge the last four years. Beyond pursuing exciting ideas and projects in Synthetic Biology, I enjoy raising two rambunctious daughters, snowboarding, football, computer animation (especially Pixar), electric cars, and travelling.

Justin Dole
Biological Sciences (2nd Year)
Heading into my second undergraduate year, I can undoubtedly say that the past few months have helped put my academic knowledge into context. I held various roles this summer, but was ultimately in charge of qualitative modelling using Autodesk Maya. This has been my first year with iGEM; the exposure to various disciplines has allowed me to see the interconnectivity between synthetic biology, engineering, and business. Besides waiting for the lab computer to process 22GB of RAM, I take pride in eating well, exercising regularly, sleeping in, and picking flowers for my Mom. I two-strap my backpack, have a keen interest in entrepreneurship, technology, and medicine, and love anything with an engine to the point that I consider myself obsessed.
Su Wang
Chemical Engineering (4th Year)
I am a chemical engineering student with a specialization in biomedical engineering. Prior to join iGEM I have been doing researches in chemical engineering labs for thermodynamics or in-situ oil upgrading. Those were professor-driven research projects where even though I had good experiences, there was little I could do to test my own hypothesis. That's why I came for iGEM; for the student driven research aspect. Here I wish to combine with what I have learned from system biology class, with my training in modelling, to work on things that interest me!
Sharon Feng
Biomedical Sciences (3rd Year)
This summer was my first year being involved in iGEM and a wet lab setting. I was fortunate to be a member of the TALEs team where I have learned so much about synthetic biology, bacterial genetics, and general lab practices. Last year, I was involved with clinical studies of children with inflammatory bowel disease at the Alberta Children's Hospital. In my free time, I enjoy reading novels, watching movies, and spending time with family and friends.
Amanda Zucoloto
Biomedical Sciences (3rd Year)
This is my first year on iGEM and I have been working with TALEs, which involved alternative cloning strategies and lots of fun time doing protein work over the Summer. When I am not pippeting in the lab to the sound of Backstreet Boys, I spend my time working out, exploring Canada and catching up with family and friends who are all the way back in Brazil. Even though I still have a couple months here in Calgary, I can't wait to come back as a graduate student!
Julie Osgood
Biomedical Sciences (3rd Year)
This is my first year with iGEM and I have spent my summer focusing on the TALE aspect of our project. I devoted my time to designing the E. coli target sequences and putting together our TALE constructs. When I’m not redoing all my experiments that didn’t work, I enjoy dancing, reading, and watching Battestar Galactica. I have spent my past couple summers working in research labs, but I loved having the opportunity to join a student driven research team. In the future I hope to be a professional Quidditch player or a geneticist.
Ali Honarmand
Biological Sciences (4th Year)
This is my 2nd year of iGEM and I am leading the TALEs part of the project. That is how I got nicknamed ""TALI."". I really like how iGEM is completely student driven and how it is not just about the science. It has really broadened my perspectives about all the different components that need to go into a project to make it successful and useful to the society. When I'm not in the lab serving dinner to E. coli or sitting in front of my computer staring at ATCGs, you can find me appreciating the gravity in the mountains either on my bike or snowboard, reading a book, or trying something completely random.

The team should like to thank everyone involved with the project this year, from Academic supervisors, to other iGEM teams' beautiful, well-coded wikis, to our sponsors and our friends. We should like to give an extra special thankyou to the lab technicians, and of course the Professors and Doctors that arranged time for us in their labs.
Academic Support
The team is very appreciative of input from every academic that has come by to our weekly presentations. It is invaluable for us to be able to practice presenting, discuss our ideas and direct the project based upon the cumulative experience of so many great minds. Special mentions go to:
Our supervisor, Dr. Luke Bawazer for suggesting use of the Si4 sequence, for strategic guidance, and for assistance with experimental planning.
Our other supervisor, Prof. Mike McPherson for securing our entry fee and funding, use of his labs, and valuable scientific insight and encouragement.

Attributions
This is the first year that Leeds University has entered an iGEM team, but hope to build upon it each year. For now, the team consists of 8 students, 2 academic supervisors and a host of helpful people
The Students
Coming from a variety of backgrounds, the team have written up some bios below to introduce you to who we are and what we do. We may be a small team, but we are definitely big on character!
Emily Taylor
Emily is a second year Biochemistry student at the University of Leeds with a particular interest in proteins and nucleosomes, as well as in the field of immunology. Keen on volunteering, Emily hopes to one day work with elephants and children in Thailand. Emily is an ideal member of the iGEM team, being highly organised, hard working and forward thinking. By the end of the project, Emily hopes to have built upon her lab skills and gain research experience in a more realistic, scientific environment.
Jonah Ciccone
Jonah is a third year Biochemist who is also passionate about art, music and karate. As well as bringing his scientific knowledge to the plate; Jonah has been put in charge of the team's artistic direction - a wise choice if you take a look through our YSB Escapades .
Looking to gain further lab experience from the project, he's also keen to delve into the SynBio community.
Joe Beton
A second year Biochemist, Joe has joined iGEM to pursue his passion, Synthetic Biology, to work creatively in the lab and to improve his public speaking skills. Outside his scientific escapades, Joe plays multiple musical instruments and is generally woofing around like the big dog he is.
Joe is looking forward to making new discoveries, helping lead the Leeds iGEM team and have an exciting summer.
Jeni Shoesmith
Jeni is from Yorkshire and is currently starting her second year studying Biochemistry at the University of Leeds. Jeni has a passion for nature and cares for multiple animals at home. She enjoys things such as knitting, sewing and cooking. Jeni has a wide range of skills and is always keen to make use of them. Both her passion for ethics and practical skills make her a valuable member of the iGEM team.
Oleg Karpov
Oleg grew up in Russia, graduated High School in The Netherlands and is now studying Medical Biochemistry in Leeds. Outside of scientific research he enjoys making music, travelling around the world and sports. The opportunity to be part of the iGEM team this summer allows Oleg to gain a deeper knowledge and understanding of the world of Synthetic Biology.
He wishes to pursue a career either in the professional sciences or run a surf shack on a beach in Mexico. Either or really.
Sabrina Knight
Sabrina studied neuroscience at Leeds because she is interested in how we think, why we think and how it affects our behaviour. Of particular interest is neuropathology, or diseases affecting the brain, which Sabrina is hoping to study further at Imperial when she takes on her Masters. She joined the team because it offered novel and interesting research to get involved in. Although the Team's project does not focus on neurology currently, Sabrina still brings essential skills and 3 years worth of lab experience - not to mention a different viewpoint!
In her spare time, Sabrina enjoys playing and watching sports of all sorts, especially tennis - she was courtside at Wimbledon this year, working as a steward, and even got to meet Andy Murray!
Daniel Burt (AKA Flipper)
Daniel is a nanotechnology student, computer geek and gamer. He is from London and is half Indian. Daniel is a technology super-fan and good at fixing things as well as having skills in many other areas. His hobbies include breakdancing, martial arts and boxing. He wishes to gain more lab experience from working in the iGEM team and to engage with the community and network with other scientists.  Flipper is also the team's Casanova; charming the underwear off anyone in a 6 metre radius. Promptly, they ask for it back, and we send him to the corner of shame.
Paul Turner
Paul is a 4th year physicist at Leeds and enjoys the problem solving aspects of his degree the most. He has always had a keen interest in science, but is keen to see the practical applications. Some of his heroes include visionaries such as Elon Musk, Gordon Gould and Richard Feynman.
Outside of university he enjoys Ten-pin bowling, volleyball, fencing and a few layman interests in history and photography. Paul is good at breaking down complex problems and explaining ideas and concepts to others - an essential skill when friends introduce you as ""a physicist""! Other skills Paul brings to the iGEM team are physical experiment design and coding experience for the web and modelling development side of the project.
As a physicist, he also brings an outside view of Synthetic Biology, and a different approach to measuring data.
The Academics
The iGEM team has gained some significant interest from quite a few academics based at Leeds University, and from multiple departments. The team only has two supervisors, but having so many great minds popping by the office certainly adds to the team's resources!
Luke Bawazer
Luke is a post-doctoral research fellow in the lab of Prof. Fiona Meldrum in the School of Chemistry at University of Leeds. Originally from Ohio, he studied for his PhD at UC Santa Barbara before moving to the UK. He has a wide range of research interests at the interface of materials, chemistry, and biology. Luke is enthusiastic to work with the creative young scientists on Leeds's iGEM team, and looks forward to learning more about Synthetic Biology from and with them. He plays football (or soccer as they say in Ohio) regularly, and listens again and again to Origin of Species in audio format while running and working out in the gym.
You can watch his recent TED Talk from TEDxWarwick here
James Ross
James Ross started out his adult life as a chef for seven years including a three year stint as Head Chef.  A career change, to fulfill his childhood dreams, led him to the University of Liverpool for an undergraduate course in Molecular Biology with Industry in which he achieved a first class degree. During this time he completed a one year placement with Pfizer in X-ray Crystallography and biophysical characterisation of protein-ligand complexes.  James also undertook a ten week summer studentship making cDNA libraries and conducting sequencing studies at the University of Liverpool.  Upon completion of his undergraduate, James was awarded a four year Wellcome Trust sponsored PhD at the University of Leeds.
Sarah Deacon
Originally from Harrogate, Sarah attained her BSc in Applied and Analytical Chemistry at Huddersfield, then moved on to her PhD in Molecular and Cellular Biology at Leeds, where she has since remained as part of the Membrane Proetien Structure initiative (MPSi) . The MPSi consortium develops techniques and resources for high throughput methods for the expression, purification, crystallisation and structure determination of integral membrane proteins, and Dr. Deacon's work within this looks at the development of antibody mimetics for clinical diagnostics. Sarah regularly works alongside Prof. Mike McPherson to this end, and her ample knowledge of antibody interactions is a great boon for the team.
If she's not too busy in her lab, Dr. Deacon often pops by to check in on the team, and is a reassuring face to see - and not only because she often comes bearing gifts of fresh coffee and biscuits!
Michael McPherson
Mike's background is molecular biology and in particular protein engineering. His current research focuses on (a) selection and applications of Adhiron artificial binding proteins (b) metalloenzymes and specifically copper containing oxidases (c) self assembling peptides (d) membrane proteins (e) synthetic biology.
Bruce Turnbull
Bruce's interests lie at the interface of carbohydrate chemistry and molecular glycobiology. In his work he combines synthetic chemistry and biophysical techniques to study carbohydrate-binding proteins. Although such interactions are essential for many normal biological processes, they also facilitate viral and bacterial infection, cancer metastasis, and entry into cells by bacterial toxin proteins. He is investigating the interactions between cholera toxin and cell surface oligosaccharides, and using this information to design small molecule inhibitors of cholera toxin using fragment-based approaches.
Steve Evans
Aside from being one of the nicest guys you'll ever meet, Steve is also head of the eponymous Evans Group, which focuses upon the physics of self organising molecular systems. OF particular interest at the moment are lipid microbubbles and membranes, and bio-functionalised inorganic surfaces. Study of the systems is varied, inlcuding the analysis of the physical transport of metabolites across systems which directly relates to our fundamental understanding of cellular biology and systems. Additonally, Professor Evans is interested in the manipulation of biological sensing mechanisms, with current work that has successfully incorporated bovine rhodopsin into an artificial membrane assembly for use in optical spectroscopic devices, and other work using actin filaments to create synthetic villi within Giant Unilamellar Vesicles.
Fiona Meldrum
Professor Meldrum's research interests fall under the general category of materials chemistry, but are particularly focused on crystal growth. The Meldrum Group is examining methods to produce crystals with defined properties, controlling their size, morphology, organisation and mechanical properties. Within this topic there is considerable emphasis on biological crystallisation processes, hence natural structures such as seashells, bones and teeth are used as an inspiration for the development of novel crystal growth strategies. These experiments also enable better understanding of natural crystal growth phenomena. The borad range of projects within the group call for a broad range of analytical techniques including scanning and transmission electron microscopy, Raman microscopy and X-ray diffraction.
Fiona works closely with Dr. Bawazer , devloping micro-fluidic techniques to control aqueous biomineralisation reactions.
Lorna Dougan
After gaining her doctorate on aqueous alcohol solutions using neutron diffraction at Edinburgh, Lorna spent 3 years as a Postdoctoral Research Associate in Biological Sciences at Columbia University, USA. Coming to Leeds in 2009, Dr. Dougan lectures in biological physics, and specializes in extremophiles - organisms that survive in extreme conditions. In 2010, Lorna received an ERC Fellowship, and now heads up the Dougan Group . The group does research in many different areas, from life in extreme environments, to single-molecule manipulation to molecular self assembly and even cryo-preservation. The group make extensive use of Atomic Force Microscopes to study protein folding within extremophiles, as well as multiple techniques for analysis of lipid or amphiphillic systems, which frequently self assemble. This is important for the study of life, as these self assembling systems are the pre-cursors to cell formation, while understanding the energy landscape of a protein highlights how it affects its properties in varying environments.
Lorna is also very active within the Institute of Physics and the Astrobiology Society, recently giving lectures on single molecule approaches to protein analysis and Extremophiles and extra-terrestial life respectively.
Chris Jones
Responsible for the delivery of undergraduate practical classes for Biochemistry and Microbiology teaching programmes. Management of the Garstang teaching laboratories, timetabling of classes and liaison with academic staff to develop or modify practical classes.
Janet Tingle
Janet is a chipper and very helpful technician in the Garstang Labs - and guaranteed to be more awake than the rest of the team first thing in the morning! Sadly, we were not able to capture her elusive self on film, most likely because she was too busy helping us out.

the Undergraduates
These are the crew members of the Oklahoma iGEM team. They have traveled from far off around the University of Oklahoma campus to join an adventurous team that will pass into history as the expedition team who did not give up or stop in the face of adversity. Only cake served as a distraction and what a wonderful distraction it was. The crew members have faced many difficult situations and have triumphed over mildly threatening bacteria that would have sent many a grown man wailing.
the Graduate Students
These are the brave officers-in-training who joined the crew of the Oklahoma iGEM team on its expedition into the moderately well-known field of anaerobic bacteria.
the Advisors
These are the patient officers who tolerated the crew members throughout the long adventure towards greatness. They have trained this ragtag collection of crew in the curiosities and processes of microbiology. They have taught a league of innocents the dangers of the field. They have taught them to pipette so the crew might pipette for themselves. Oh the wonders of the officers.

Literature study
Prof. Marjan De Mey and Charlotte Verniers assisted us during brainstorming and advised us during our literature study and the writing and presentation of our paper. Frederik De Bruyn also threw in some ideas during brainstorming.
The paper was written by the students of the UGent iGEM team. Presentations were also made by the students.
In the lab
Pieter Coussement, Frederik De Bruyn and Gert Peters gave us an introduction to common lab techniques. Frederik also gave us a tutorial on Clone Manager. We received safety training from Gilles Velghe who also made us familiar with the lab. Isabelle Maryns showed us how to safely handle ethidiumbromide. Safety forms were filled in by the students and Prof. De Mey.
InBio (the UGent Centre of Expertise for Industrial Biotechnology and Biocatalysis) let us make use of their lab and made sure all the necessary lab equipment was at our disposal. The whole InBio staff was always ready to assist and advise us when we asked for help.
InBio provided us with the strain bearing plasmids that contain the ccdA-gfp construct we used (E. coli DH5α + pTGD-ccdA-Pmb1-BCD7-GFPCmFRT). They provided the bacterial strain in which the knock-in was performed (E. coli MG1655 ΔendA DE3), strains containing plasmids with the T7ccdB fragment (E. coli DH5α + pXSpFRT-T7ccdB) and the strain we used for making P1 phage lysate (E. coli BW26547), along with a small dose of P1 lysate. InBio provided us with a linear backup of the ccdA-gfp construct. They also constructed backup strains (E. coli MG1655 ΔendA DE3 ccdA-Pmb1GFP-CmFRT & E. coli MG1655 ΔendA DE3 ccdA-Pmb1GFP) in which CIChE could be performed if other experiments failed.
Primers starting with MDM and CGL were designed by Prof. Marjan De Mey. Primers beginning with oMEMO were designed by InBio. Primers starting with iGEM were designed by students of the UGent iGEM team. Pieter Coussement also designed some primers for a back mutation.
All the labwork was conducted by the students of the UGent team. Labwork over the two months was distributed between all students. All results were analysed by the students, especially Jules and Tine. We did however receive invaluable insights from our instructors: Prof. Marjan De Mey, Pieter Coussement, Frederik De Bruyn and Gert Peters.
Other
The following was also accomplished by the students:
Tine and Marlies constructed the wiki page. All texts on the wiki were written by students. Tim made the little movie explaining our project. Eva created our logo. Posters, flyers & surveys were made by the students. Survey results were analysed by Eline. She also made sure our Facebook and Twitter pages stayed up to date. All figures without reference were created by students.
Concerning ethics:
Renate and Tine interviewed the following professional scientists who helped us gain more insight in several ethical issues: Prof. Filip Buekens, Prof. Geert De Jaeger, Prof. Tom Desmet, Prof. Wim Soetaert, Prof. Els Van Damme. Texts were written by Renate and Eva. Frederik De Bruyn brought us in contact with Prof. Buekens and joined the discussion.

Our research at Cornell iGEM would not have been possible without the advice, guidance, and supplies of many of our advisors.
The wetlab portion of our research was conducted in Professor Archer’s lab. Dr. Archer provided us with lab facilities including a gel imaging station, microscopes, sterile hood, centrifuges, thermal-cyclers, and vortexes. Finally, she advised us on lab safety techniques.
Most of our fungal engineering was done in the Turgeon Lab. The Turgeon Lab provided us with their lab space including their incubator, sterile hood, autoclave, and centrifuge. They provided us a protocol on how to protoplast  and also mentored and advised us. In addition, they provided us with a
strain of Cochliobolus heterostrophus with which we were able to protoplast and attempt transformations. After successful protoplasting, they showed us the proper procedure for polyethylene glycol transformation including recovery via molten regeneration broth. They provided us with materials including SRB's micronutrients and complete media broth.  Finally, they provided us with high expression vectors for Cochliobolus heterostrophus which we were able to use as a positive control when transforming.
The Luo Lab gave us a sample of a plasmid, pIVEX2.3d, which contained the T7 promoter and terminator, and access to a fluorescent microscope and plate reader.
Dr. David Hibbett from the Clark Lab provided us with a sample of a sequenced strain of Ganoderma lucidum on which we were able to test various transformation methods.
Dr. Xiling Shen advised us throughout the year and gave us feedback on our project timeline and presentation.
Ecovative provided advice and inspiration on our project. They offered to grow our genetically engineered strains and also provided us with modeling data to evaluate the packing material.
Thank You!

Tim Abbott
Tim knows who you are. And he knows what you want. If you're looking to unravel the secrets of the antisense RNA strand, he will falsely say that he doesn't know, but what he does know is a particular set of skills. Skills acquired over a long career that make him very dangerous to cells, so that they cannot hide their classified intel from him. Recruited by the the iGEM intercellular coalition (in a microcosm far away) to prevent worldwide biological warfare and Malthusian catastrophe, secret agent TR Abbott is armed with the cunning and intellect that parallels the legendary 007 himself.                                                                                                                                                                                                                             In the shadowy dark of night, he scales the highest chitin walls, dodges laser detection beams and disables all nucleus security defenses to deftly reprogram all cell circuitry before you can type
In the stark light of day, the dapper gentleman woos women with his brilliant smile and golden locks, bakes Thirty-Minute Brownies in twenty minutes and makes dirty dishes disappear. He struts not walks, he dodges and frolics, and all his bills are paid. He sleeps once a week, and when he does, it is in front of his computer. With his eyes open. He's Tim. Timothy Robert Abbott. And he is always watching. He will look for you, he will find you, and he will ki--
Hannah Ajmani
Affectionately nicknamed Hanana, she is best known as the Caucasian whose actually 100% Indian, the CTB addict, and the girl who managed to burn a microwavable brownie. She hails from Jersey, produces movies in Cali (watch Sharknado, it's so bad... it's good). And guys, she can rap. Seriously, isn't this girl cool?! She's the last person you'd expect on Cornell iGEM, but the first person to lecture you on electroporation and/or inoculation if you ask. I think she has a secret liking for biology ...don't ask her though, she'll only deny it. When she isn't pretending to dislike biology, she puts on the most kick-ass outreach programs in iGEM history (...no offense Swati). Hannah is an amazing person be around. Her giggles sparkle, her smile is contagious, you can't help but love her. If you ever feel a little down, read one of her emails (seriously guys, read her emails) and you'll be sure to see her motto... ""Get excited people!""
Ryan Ashley
Ryan James Ashley, at first glance, seems to be a quiet, unassuming fellow. Often referred to as “the only one who’s actually working,” Ryan is known for his unwavering focus, matched only by his superhuman productivity. Little did we know, however, that Ryan had all of us fooled. Ryan is impervious to pain, insensitive to temperature fluctuations, and unlimited in his capacity for retaining knowledge. He had mastered every martial art form in the universe by his twelfth birthday. Since then, he has looked to dominating the dance floor. Having already prevailed over the more exotic varieties, he can now be found salsa-ing his way into onlookers’ hearts at every turn. In his spare time, he has been known to traipse about the Norwegian countryside with an army of mountain goats.
Nupur Bhatt
Standing in the purple light of the cave, something seems amiss. The beautifully morose bass music that drew you here, almost against your will, has faded to a single, wavering note in the darkness. A figure is approaching, a calm grin just visible atop her slight frame. Suddenly, you are afraid. You raise your longsword just as your vision succumbs to a fiery halo; then, you open your eyes groggily. A scene from Skyrim flickers from the screen on Nupur's Thinkpad; yet, during your nap, ninety-six minipreps were completed, the lab reorganized, and the wiki redesigned and updated. You grab a box of pipette tips to continue your mastermix, only to find an intricate design in the negative space. A calm grin rests on Nupur's face.
Arun Chakravorty
The ladies of iGEM once tried to expel Arun from the team for his distracting good looks.  He simply
winked at them
and they changed their minds.  Armed with his sparkling smile, baby soft cheeks, and boyish charm, Arun will melt your heart (and your agar plates).  But don’t be fooled.  This dastardly devil will always surprise you.  One moment he’ll be asleep, the next he’ll be chair jousting.  One minute he’ll be serenading you with sweet sounds from his scrumptious, supple lips; the next minute he’ll be rapping B.I.G.  One day he’ll be clean shaven, ten years later, he’ll maybe have a five o’clock shadow.  Despite these bipolar tendencies, two things remain constant in Arun’s life: he has a flair for dramatic pipetting and the ladies love him.  But I beg you ladies, calm yourselves and heed my last warning: he will take your grandpa’s style; he will take your grandpa’s style.  If you ever need it back, he will still be in Ithaca.  But actually though.
Jonlin Chen
The Cornell iGEM team has a secret weapon. Her name: J-Chen. As a locally-grown, ‘hood-dwelling laboratory superhero, J-Chen skillfully navigates through the ins and outs of Ithaca in her Ganodermobile. Though seemingly unintimidating at first glance, beware: she can whip out her legendary ice cream maker at any given moment, and coat you in a lemony flavor of happiness so fast that you’ll forget what you were cloning. Not only is she powerful herself, her faithful minions, Solutions I, II, and III, are always within arms’ reach. Don’t dare question J-Chen’s seniority, either, or else she’ll hold your precious 97 cultures hostage, until you provide a box of those sacred yellow tips as ransom. And if there’s ever miniprepping to be done, don’t worry about it – J-Chen has already gotten started.
Rebecca Chew
The one and only Rebecca Chew, From wetlab to drylab, there's nothing this chemical engineer can't do. Her efforts to build the team's fungal growth chamber are so great, That our fungi will soon grow taller than the Empire State. Outside of lab, Rebecca enjoys chocolate desserts and midnight strolls through the park, And secretly wishes she was either Rihanna or a great white shark. So here are a few last words for Rebecca Chew, You are amazing, where would we be without you?
Sharlene Dong
Ding-Dong! Who’s there? Bing-Dong! Hello? Ring-Dong! Who goes there? Ring-a-ling Dong! Surely, someone’s there? Lene-Dong! Sharley, please introduce yourself. Sharlene Dong! What could be said about Sharlene Dong? Apart from her jovial laugh and smile, she can salsa dance ‘till the cows come home, or rather, until 1am when the Big Red Barn closes. Regardless, she is an undergraduate Pre-Med Chemical Engineer that also happens to be a member of iGEM – makes one wonder how she has enough time for anything! Despite her hectic schedule, she still manages to conduct research on the calcium channels in the heart and enjoy the companionship of her iGEM teammates.
Sara Gregg
Sara is a fellow Clevelander who can aim for any goal like Hawkeye can hit all of his targets.  One word, LEGENDARY.  She has the endurance of a turtle but the speed of the rabbit to run for miles everywhere, beating all of us to Moosewood.  Even more, she can consume a common frozen internationally famed desert faster than it takes for a sweetened, fluffy dairy solid to phase change into a pool of sticky coco-liquid.  Looking past this girl's legendary fame, she's got a brightening smile which will command innocent looking mushrooms to transform into dangerous beautifully-colorful homes for the Smurfs.  Watch out for this one...
Alex Han
Alex can whip up anything from multiple Asiago cheese dishes to fungi models with his mastery of statistics! He has traveled all over the world, from studying abroad in Denmark (learning the language and even more wonderful recipes!) to representing Cornell in Turkey! Also a jokester, he does not hesitate to
creep on
be friendly to other members to make their days that much better! :D
Eric Holmes
Unlike most humans, Eric   T.S.  Holmes was born from an orange flower on the tallest branch of the great sequoia  in Oregon. At the moment of his birth, lightning tore across the sky only to strike his fragile body. He then grew wings, slew a few dragons, and then decided he wanted to be an iGEM member. His full name, Eric Taylor Swift Holmes, warned his interviewers that he was trouble when he walked in. And yet, the iGEM  gods smiled  upon him in his most desperate hour, knowing that the female singer (who had been named in his honor) would be devastated by the grief of her beloved. A master of all knots and traps, he has since conquered every terrain in the universe, including the fiery depths of the autoclave room. He now looks to the vast waters of Cayuga Lake in search of a legendary fish, one that has only been spotted once, by him of course. He captured only a picture but now thirsts for the creature's carcass, to avenge his  lost left wing. In obsession, he surrounds himself with images of the deadly beast, Arunicus chakravorticum. He hopes that with his newly honed abilities from being an iGEM wet lab minion, he will be able to take down the creature.
Danielle Huang
Her second consecutive year in iGEM, Danielle has proven time and again that she's invaluable to the world of Biological Engineering.  When she's not sitting in one of the many classes she's taking, you'll find her conducting complicated experiments in the lab.  Already outclassing the Cornell biology labs by her junior year, Danielle spent 8 months doing an Engineering Co-Op at Johnson & Johnson as well as Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, assisting in process development and antibody therapeutics analysis.  Danielle is the person you want to bring with you on a nighttime walk; she will enlighten you about the stars and constellations, in addition to being a great person to hang out with.  She is one of our team's highest commodities, being in demand by everyone all the time.
Daniel Leach
His stare is the most efficient selection marker. To transform, bacteria just ask him for plasmids. His pipetting thumb alone has made more progress than lesser scientists’ entire bodies. He doesn’t worry about being sterile; other organisms avoid his work out of respect. The parts registry accepted his genome as a standard part. He once failed a procedure, just to see how it feels. His scent grows E. coli faster than LB. He is the most interesting iGEM competitor in the world.
“I don’t always create new plasmids, but when I do, I prefer Biobricks.""
Rafael Lizarralde
Rafael is a member of the latest generation of ninjas, and spends the majority of his time battling creatures from the seventh dimension. Not only has he mastered the art of dandelion decapitation, he also recently learned how to call forth the power of the heavens after many long hours studying rain dance simulations.
His interactions with other dimensions have left him with an uncanny knack for engineering. Some of his latest creations include the mobius bagel and a controller eerily reminiscent of the iPhone 5, but so dangerous that he won't let lesser mortals even approach the device. Any ideas about what exactly this controller does are mere speculation; however, since its invention Rafael seems to have developed an unhealthy obsession with spirals, and can occasionally be found talking to snails.
When not trying to save the world from impending doom, Rafael enjoys cuddling with his favorite glow-in-the-dark purple cuttlefish, crushing defenseless plushie Totoros, and tormenting young iGEMers with a gaze that makes even E. coli scream (research pending on how this affects transformation efficiency).
Oat Luengvarinkul
Portrayed by actor Jesse Eisenberg in the upcoming 2014 film TSN, Episode II, Oat is a Thai architect/computer programmer and internet entrepeneur. The film's production studio offers a spoiler-removed description of his biography/ the movie's plot:  """"Together with his college roommates, Oat launched social networking site ******** from Cornell's dormitory rooms to great success before introducing  ******** onto other campuses nationwide and relocating  ******** to Palo Alto, California. But his hearty  ******** payday would come at a price. Mired in legal disputes, Oat soon discovered that many of those he had befriended on and off  ******** during his rise to the top were eager to see him fall. As ex-friends engage Oat in the courtroom for ownership of  ********, it appears that the young entrepreneur might have let  ********-based greed eclipse his better judgment. Director David Fincher (Seven, Fight Club) offers Oat's early life as an exploration into the meaning of success in the early 21st century from the perspectives of the innovative  ******** founders who revolutionized the way we communicate.""""  Also, he dabbles in architecture. And Facebook.
Jeffrey Ly
From the moment Jeffrey was born, he knew he was destined to join the Cornell iGEM team. Two years later, he was successfully recruited. His youth isn't all drawback: his energy rivals that of his best friend and mentor, the energizer bunny, and it allows him to be more on top of things than most people. It has also earned him a place on the team as director of all things requiring enthusiasm. His other responsibilities include optimizing his teammates' vacation schedules and cheering up cells recovering from transformation. You may say he's a dreamer, but he is the only one. Isn't he cool?
Ritvik Sarkar
Born in Calcutta, India, Ritvik Sarkar is a world renowned Poké-master, best known for conquering the Elite Four with a level-7 Charmander.  Growing bored with his constant victories, he chose to pursue a degree in mechanical engineering at Cornell University.  As a member of Cornell iGEM, Ritvik can hold his own in the machine shop, and has also been a valuable asset during outreach events.  As a Taekwondo black belt, Ritvik is also indispensable at the perpetually rambunctious iGEM social events.   Ritvik enjoys listening to music and playing the cello, for which he also composes pieces.
Mac Sennett
Mac came to CUGEM by an unidentified aircraft that was claimed by Ithaca’s gorges.  In order to repair his ship and travel back to his own galaxy, Mac joined our team as the Dry Lab leader in order to have access to the machine shop, where he quickly displayed his other worldly skills.  Although initially intent on repairing his aircraft and returning home, Mac changed his mind upon realizing how amazing synthetic biology was. When not leading the fabrication aspect of the project, Mac can be seen holding his own with the best of biologists. Despite his suboptimal pouring technique which he uses to discourage suspicion, many of us are convinced that Mac may be coercing his bacteria to follow his will with his supernatural powers. Once an intergalactic mercenary, Mac has continued his desire for excitement by moonlighting as Ithaca’s own superhero. When not saving freshman from ill-advised gorge jumping and the bipolar weather, Mac can be seen answering the prayers of his fellow iGEM members, once appearing out of nowhere to give his stranded members a ride, delivering his catch phrase, “come to daddy.” For the moment, Mac has decided to settle down in Ithaca to pursue his interests in neurobiology and biochemistry. For the sake of mankind, let’s hope he decides to stay here forever.
Prashant Sharma
Here we have spotted the rare Prashant Sharma in his natural habitat. Known as Shawn by the natives of these bleached-white halls, this elusive species is most easily sighted when mingling with others of its kind. Unlike previously examined organisms, those of the Prashant genus are capable of an untroubled manner granting them a unique niche in this high-stress ecosystem. However, also characteristic of the Shawn is an innate sense of humor that both its prospective predators and prey find startling. While researchers continue to study this enigmatic creature, there is much debate over the ethics and legality of their use as laboratory assistants, despite their seeming acuity at it.
Mark Simpson
Knighted as “the God of Electrocompetent  Stocks,” Mark has aroused a growing religion among iGEMers worshipping his ability to create infinite stocks with the bat of an eye. He has astounded his followers with his ability to eat red bell peppers raw and his Pillsbury doughboy impression will leave you giggling on the outside, but crying on the inside…out of happiness of course. After winging…I mean, graduating in 3 years, Mark acquired the nickname “Turbo!”, also reflecting his godliness in the lab. Mark is a valuable asset to our team, having trademarked several widely employed lab techniques such as hand centrifugation and mouth pressurized column chromatography. His sense of humor brightens the room, providing zesty comedic relief to our meetings.  ""Meeting adjourned!""
Christine Soong
Christine is from Ohio. Enough said. But wait, there’s more… In the U.S. government’s time of need, they turned to Christine.  She did not let them down.  Reluctant to leave the iGEM team, but knowing that country comes first, Christine heroically chose to spend her summer at a top-secret military intelligence base.  She masquerades as a summer intern at NASA, but in actuality she is a member of the CIA.  Of course if you ask her she would deny it; that is the mark of a true CIA operative.  Christine spends her days intercepting and decoding satellite communications from not-so-friendly nations, and has prevented two world wars to date.  An electronics genius and computer whiz, Christine is extremely talented, but that is only evident through her work, she’s quite humble.  An animal lover, she plans to own 101 dalmations after she graduates Cornell in under four years.  When she's not working, Christine enjoys running, kayaking, and other outdoor activities.  Just as she stepped in to save the U.S., she will return in the fall to make sure the CUGEM team is a success.
Olya Spassibojko
While many are left spinning like a centrifuge at 15,000rpm and scratching their heads as they attempt to follow our mycelium-like meetings where team members never fail to branch off each other’s ideas, Olya calmly captures the pertinent points in her impeccably kept minutes. When not typing and uploading the team’s never ending stream of minutes, she can be found in the wetlab running PCRs and secretly wishing that the loading dye was a few shades lighter and turqoise in color just like everything else she owns. Have we mentioned that the “Bio-philic Olya” absolutely adores her fluffy, hypoallergenic, turquoise kitty which listens to Anberlin too?
Tina Su
TinamiSu 2 Whole Dill Pickles A cup of oatmeal 1 cup Plain Greek Yogurt 3 thirds of a cup roasted chili pepper hummus .786 baby carrots A dollop of mayonnaise 1 aliquot of honey Sweet, Delicious, and Expensive. TinamiSu is a must try.  Although very sweet, it certainly doesn’t lack a bit of a kick. Acclaimed for its creamy texture, it is sure to get all your friends talking—maybe even a little too much.  Regardless, TinamiSu is always tasteful and a fun dish.  Served both hot or cold, you know you can turn to it on your happy days, your difficult days, or even your rainy days. This dish is best consumed very slowly with a pipettor.
Swati Sureka
When we accepted her onto the team last year, Swati was an unassuming freshman. Little did we know she was a ticking time-bomb just waiting to go off. Her rapid rise to power makes perfect sense in retrospect: she is well-versed in four different martial arts and has received training from two separate intelligence agencies. She has no need for competent cells because she has developed her own martial art, clonejutsu, which allows her to punch, kick, or elbow DNA directly into the cells of any organism. She possesses great strength, cunning, and ruthlessness, and will be the most difficult adversary you ever face.
Yoshiko Toyoda
Yoshi is the muse of our iGEM team. She comes in the early mornings to set up PCRs to prepare everyone else’s day in lab. Her awe-inspiring penmanship on primers and mini-preps brings clarity to our otherwise chaotic assembly of reagents. Faster than a green dinosaur or a trusty mid-sized automobile, Yoshi works with great diligence and grace, even when under pressure. When she is done for the day, she relaxes with some of the finer works of culture, such as her history readings or Japanese soap operas.
Lydia Wang
Still using Snap Chat? That is going to be outdated soon for college students. Our electrical & computer engineering genius—Lydia—is working on developing super advanced mobile apps for the iPhone 11 that can literally read your mind and plan your life for the next 50 years (…or more). As a co-op in GE Intelligent Platforms in 2013, Lydia has already started her master plan. She joined iGEM in the spring of 2012 to gather information on what smart people in Cornell do in their daily lives for her project, but was disappointed to find that they are actually not robots, but a bunch of kids playing with bacteria and pipettes. So she decided to stay and help out with the Dry Lab, while secretly incorporating microcontrollers in whatever systems the team develops to monitor and control iGEMers, slowly turning them into real robots by the end of 2013. Even though a few people on the team know of her plan, they are more than happy to accept whatever Lydia put into the Dry Lab components because they make the systems work like magic. And ultimately, they accept the fact that they will become robots someday.
Kyle Wheeler
Kyle Wheeler is Cornell iGEM's resident cyborg. After failing to ride a century as a wee babe, Kyle, in his infinite infant wisdom, had an epiphany: to succeed, he must genetically engineer himself to become one with the machine. Thus began his interest in iGEM. Surrounded in a shroud of mystery, Kyle tries to protect his secret identity through seemingly innocuous activities like coding and eating lots of organic produce. Hailing from a long line of iGEM Risley-ites, he keeps himself in physical shape by casually biking 40+ miles around lakes and mentally fit by perfoming wet lab voodoo and concocting business plans on the sponsorship subteam. Ladies, try to keep up with this man's genius, but don't worry too much - no matter how slow you go or whatever torrential thunderstorm you find yourself in, Kyle's the kind of guy that rides by your side.
Faculty Advisors
Dr. Xiling Shen - Electrical and Computer Engineering
Dr. Xiling Shen has been an assistant professor in the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Cornell University since August 2009.
Born in Shanghai, China, Dr. Xiling Shen went on to receive his BS and MS degree from the Electrical Engineering Department of Stanford University in 2001. He then worked at Barcelona Design Inc. for two years, specializing in analog circuit design and optimization, before joining Professor Mark Horowtiz' research group in the Electrical Engineering Department at Stanford in 2003. In the first two years of his PhD, he collaborated with Professor Joseph Kahn on using adaptive spatial equalization to compensate modal dispersion in multimode fibers. From 2005 to 2008, he worked with Professor Harley McAdams, Professor Lucy Shapiro, and Professor David Dill on modeling and analyzing the asymmetric division of Caulobacter crescentus. Xiling’s postdoctoral work focused on synthetic biology with Dr. Adam Arkin in Bioengineering at UC Berkeley prior to joining the faculty at Cornell University’s School of Electrical and Computer Engineering.
Dr. B. Gillian Turgeon - Plant Pathology and Plant-Microbe Biology
Gillian Turgeon is a fungal geneticist studying molecular mechanisms by which fungi cause disease on plants and the evolution of diverse reproductive strategies.  Both are recognition questions.  For pathogenicity the issue is how cells from different organisms, i.e., the fungus and the plant host, communicate with each other to cause or prevent disease.  For sexual reproductive development, fungi either require a partner of opposite mating type to mate or can self-mate, thus the issue is how fungal cells recognize self from non-self. Using the filamentous ascomycete plant pathogen Cochliobolus heterostrophus and close relatives for comparison, the Turgeon lab pioneered molecular genetic, genomic, and phylogenomic tools for filamentous fungi and has deployed these to illuminate the roles of secondary metabolites in plant pathogenesis and host specificity, reproductive development, iron metabolism and oxidative stress, and niche adaptation.
Dr. Shivaun Archer - Biomedical Engineering
Dr. Shivaun Archer is a Senior Lecturer in charge of the Biomedical Engineering Undergraduate Instructional Laboratories. She designs and teaches undergraduate instructional labs for five biomedical engineering courses: BME 131, BME 301, BME 302, BME 401, and BME 402. The labs are designed to illustrate the course material and bring research to undergraduate education whilst exposing students to cutting edge technology and research methodology. A significant emphasis in all the labs is biomedical nanotechnology. Each of the five courses has a hands-on lab module that focuses specifically on nanobiotechnology. Overall, the lab modules enhance the hands-on training of Cornell students in the areas of microfabrication, microfluidics, biosensors, nano/microbiotechnology, and drug delivery. In recognition of her efforts in undergraduate education, Dr. Archer has received a prestigious College of Engineering Teaching award.
Before coming to Cornell, Dr. Archer worked for five years at Lynntech, Inc. a small research company specializing in biotechnology, biomaterials, chemical and biological sensors, medical biotechnology, and environmental remediation. Her work on wastewater treatment for long term space missions resulted in her receiving two NASA Inventions Space Act Awards. She also holds a joint appointment as a Research Associate in the School of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering. Her research interests include nanobiotechnology and tissue engineering.
Dr. Matthew DeLisa - Chemical Engineering
Matthew DeLisa received his B.S. in Chemical Engineering from the University of Connecticut in 1996; his Ph.D. in Chemical Engineering from the University of Maryland in 2001; and did postdoctoral work at the University of Texas-Austin, Department of Chemical Engineering. DeLisa joined the Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering at Cornell University as an assistant professor in 2003 and was promoted to associate professor in 2009. He recently served as a Gastprofessur at ETH Zürich in the Institut für Mikrobiologie.
Professor DeLisa's research focuses on understanding and controlling the molecular mechanisms underlying protein biogenesis -- folding and assembly, membrane translocation and post-translational modifications -- in the complex environment of a living cell. His contributions to science and engineering include the invention of numerous commercially important technologies for facilitating the discovery, design and manufacturing of human drugs and seminal discoveries in the areas of cellular protein folding and protein translocation. DeLisa has received several awards for his work including an NSF CAREER award, a NYSTAR Watson Young Investigator award, a Beckman Foundation Young Investigator award, an Office of Naval Research Young Investigator award, and a NYSTAR Distinguished Faculty Award. He was also named one of the top 35 young innovators (TR35) by MIT's Technology Review in 2005 and was selected as the inaugural recipient of the Wiley-Blackwell Biotechnology and Bioengineering Daniel I.C. Wang award, which honors a distinguished young researcher in this field. Most recently, he was honored with a Cornell Provost's Award for Distinguished Scholarship and was the recipient of the Young Investigator Award from the American Chemical Society's BIOT division.
Dr. Julius B. Lucks - Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering
Julius B. Lucks is Assistant Professor of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering at Cornell University, and a James C. and Rebecca Q. Morgan Sesquicentennial Faculty Fellow.  After attending the North Carolina School of Science and Mathematics for high school, he became an undergraduate at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill where he performed research in organic synthesis and the application of density functional theory to studying the electronic properties of atoms and molecules as a Goldwater Scholar.  After graduating with a BS in Chemistry, he spent a summer working with Robert Parr before obtaining an M. Phil. in Theoretical Chemistry at Cambridge University as a Churchill Scholar.  As a Hertz Fellow at Harvard University, he researched problems in theoretical biophysics including RNA folding and translocation, viral capsid structure and viral genome organization, under David R. Nelson.  As a Miller Fellow at UC Berkeley in the laboratory of Adam P. Arkin, he engineered versatile RNA-sensing transcriptional regulators that can be easily reconfigured to independently regulate multiple genes, logically control gene expression, and propagate signals as RNA molecules in gene networks. He also lead the team that developed SHAPE-Seq, an experimental technique that utilizes next generation sequencing for probing RNA secondary and tertiary structures of hundreds of RNAs in a single experiment.

Developing Our Team
In order to achieve our goals and develop FREDsense, we required a diverse background of skill sets. Seven members of the 2012 Calgary iGEM team joined forces to become part of the FREDsense team. Our skills represent a variety of technical specialities ranging from genetics, biochemistry, and microbiology to electrochemistry. To ensure our venture's success, we enlisted the aid of technical, business, and legal experts to our advisory board. This has aided in producing a dynamic team that will be able to deliver on FREDsense's goals and bring our technology to market.
Building the FREDsense Team
Our team is composed of seven students from diverse technical backgrounds, all who were members of the 2012 Calgary Collegiate iGEM team where this technology platform was initially developed from. To suppliment our skills we have also enlisted the aid of several key advisors from diverse technical, business, and legal backgrounds to sit on our advisory board and act to guide FREDsense Technologies as it develops.
Team Members
Our team consists of seven members from diverse technical backgrounds. Each member played a critical role in developing the technology from the 2012 Calgary iGEM team and has played a significant role in playing multiple roles in business development of FREDsense Technologies.
Iain George
This is my second year on our iGEM team at the University of Calgary. I am a master student in biological sciences at the U of C. My research is in investigating how RNA-binding proteins act to regulate various genes at the post-transcriptional level. Previously, I worked as a member of the Biofilm Research Group at the U of C, studying how bacterial biofilms could be applied to bioremediate environmentally contaminated sites. When I am not living/sleeping/supervising in the lab, you may find me in the mountains surrounding Calgary hiking and trying my hand at photography.
Emily Hicks
This is my fifth summer in iGEM, which probably means that I really, really need to get a life.  This summer I am looking forward to stepping outside the lab and tackling an entrepreneurial project. I am incredibly excited to see what we discover and hopefully see our FRED project from last year move into the real world. I’ll no doubt still be enjoying the late nights in the lab, but will hopefully be able to gain a good perspective on the business side of things. In my spare time I enjoy beating David at flight control, collecting stuffed pandas as well as taking drinks from my favourite water fountain in the Health Sciences Centre.
David Lloyd
This is my fifth year being involved in iGEM in which time I have had the opportunity to work with the Alberta team for two years as an undergraduate, two years as a team advisor for Calgary Collegiate, and now with the Calgary Entrepreneurial Team. I have completed a BSc and MSc in Biochemistry and now am pursuing the FREDsense Technologies venture full time. I am very passionate for using my synthetic biology experience as a manager, entreprenuer, and educator and hope to merge these passions into an exciting career in the future. iGEM has been an amazing opportunity and I greatly look forward to another year in the competition!
Robert Mayall
I have just graduated with my Bachelors degree from the University of Calgary. This is my third year being involved with iGEM, and my first trip into the entrepreneurial category. I was heavily involved in the technical design of FRED and am the electrochemist for our group. I will continue my technical role as a member of FREDsense Technologies by focusing on the development of our platform technology.
Lisa Oberding
I graduated recently from the University of Calgary with a degree in Cellular, Molecular, and Microbial Biology, and am now pursuing my M.Sc. in Petroleum Microbiology. This is my second year with iGEM, which I got involved with as a chance to gain more research experience, learn about synthetic biology, and further define my research interests. I was involved last year with developing the sensor element of FRED, however moving forward with FREDsense I have found myself taking on more of a business focused role. I find that I am enjoying the experience of learning a completely foreign skill-set as well as getting to see science and research from a completely new direction.
Maggie Renaud-Young
I am in my fifth year of the Biochemistry and Molecular Biology PhD program in the Southern Alberta Cancer Biology Research Group at the University of Calgary. The focus of my studies is the cellular response to obstructed DNA replication, and how disturbances to this process contribute to genome instability using the budding yeast model system. This is the third year that I have worked with iGEM but different from the past two years I am not an adviser, and the project is less about the bio and all about the business. It is has been a great experience for me to see the world from this perspective and I look forward to a future in research and development of a product I had a part in creating. The rest of my team and I hope that this is the launchpad for a successful business and we are excited about this opportunity to present our plan in this competition.
Patrick Wu
I am currently doing my Masters of Biomedical Technology at the University of Calgary. This is my fourth year as a participant of the iGEM competition, but my contributions this year are primarily towards construction of the Entrepreneurial team wiki. I am keenly interested in user-centered design and I am always amazed at how people can combine engineering and biology together in the iGEM competition.
Advisors
Our advisory board consists of several technical, business, and law experts who were carefully selected to aid in devleoping FREDsense Technologies.
Dr. Sean Caffrey

Team:Penn State/Team
From 2013.igem.org
Undergraduate Team
Advisers
Undergrad Team
Andres Carbonell
Born in the tropical paradisiac lands of Panama in Central America,  Andres a Biotechnology major is going into his junior year of college, and as a gentleman in the pursuit of knowledge and  mankind's well being, has dedicated his short academic life to science and research. His goals and dreams involve a good balance of medical research  and a life of invaluable doctor-patient relationships. Andres has found in iGEM a shortcut in the long and rewarding path of mastering knowledge and happiness
Casey Hall
Casey’s passion for agriculture has led her to pursuing a major in Biological Engineering with a Food and Biological Engineering Emphasis. She is currently in her junior year and after college, she desires to attend graduate school focusing on production agriculture and genetically modified plants. It has always been her dream to help feed the world and iGEM provided a great opportunity for her to see what genetic modification is all about. Casey was our team lead this year and has also worked specifically with the CesA project from start to finish as well as the plant promoter project design and wet lab procedures. Outside of iGEM, Casey enjoys hunting, fishing, and spending time in the great outdoors.
Kevin Thyne
Kevin is a senior in Molecular Biology and Biochemistry. He joined iGEM for the opportunity to work in a lab and do new, exciting research. He worked on last year’s iGEM project and enjoyed it so much that he’s back for more! Kevin definitely adds experience and eons of knowledge to the team and is the go-to person when anyone has questions. When he’s not being a wealth of knowledge, he is involved in the American Society of Microbiology (ASM) and the National Society of Collegiate Scholars (NSCS).
Lars Berg
Lars has just finished his freshman year at the University of Oklahoma Honors College, but will begin his sophomore year at Wesleyan University in the fall. Being a part of Penn State’s iGEM team has helped him explore genomics, botany, education, and web design, which have all been helpful experiences for someone undecided on his major. Lars worked on the butanol project, the outreach presentation to teachers and students, and the website. In addition to exploring fields of study to figure out what to do with his life, he enjoys ultimate frisbee, traveling, and walking his corgi.
Laura Hoover
Entering her junior year, Laura is a Biology major focusing in vertebrate physiology. As a trained EMT, Laura plans to pursue a career in the medical field. However, her academic interests vary greatly. After learning about synthetic biology in a molecular biology course, Laura joined the Penn State iGEM team eager to learn more about the emerging field. Beyond being able to participate in undergraduate research, the experience offered her an in depth education in the planning and execution of research projects. Laura worked on both the CesA and promoter projects. In addition, Laura is heavily involved in Penn State’s IFC/Panhellenic Dance Marathon as her sorority’s THON chair for the past two years.
Michael Easterbrook
Michael is a Penn State junior, studying Chemical Engineering with intended minors in Entrepreneurship and Molecular Biology.  He has had a passion to work with genetic engineering since high school and he has been involved in genetics research since his freshman year of college.  iGEM was an exciting next step for developing his skills in synthetic biology research.  He was heavily involved with the design and construction of the cellulose synthase, cas9, and plant promoter projects.  He also learned html/CSS this summer and was responsible for a majority of the coding for the team wiki.  In his free time, he enjoys discussing philosophy, playing soccer, playing video games, and visiting family and friends.
Michael Stokes
Michael is a Penn State Senior in the field of Biotechnology.  He has had a longstanding fascination with synthetic biology and biofuels, and other biotech applications such as organ cloning.  His plans for the future to include research in biotechnology to develop these things for use in everyday life.  He joined iGEM in order to gain experience working with biotechnology.  At the start he primarily worked on the butanol project, though he became more involved in website design later on, learning html/CSS programming language, and using his previous experience with Photoshop and attention to detail to help in its construction.
Nayab Gill
Nayab recently graduated with her bachelors in Biology from Penn State. With the goal of becoming a high school Biology teacher, her next step is to pursue a masters degree in Science education. Since her undergraduate studies focused on vertebrae physiology; iGEM served as a crash course in plant and synthetic biology. Although difficult at first, it has proven to be a rewarding experience for her.  As part of the iGEM team she worked on the vanillin project and human practices. Outside of iGEM, she is a home body that enjoys reading, the cinema and spending time with family and friends.
Phillip Cygan
As a man of intelligence and drive, Philip joined iGEM this year for the first time. Going into his Senior year at Penn State, Phil is a Mathematics Education Major, planning to educate high school students in the complex ideas of mathematics and all it has to offer. Philip is involved in Penn State through many organizations and sports, leading a very active lifestyle. As an active student, he decided to try iGEM, even with a very small background, and is working on the Cas9 project and learning more than he imagined he could. He has become a lab rat, spending nearly everyday in lab, working on this project. Phil, not just a student in Math and Education, but a student in synthetic biology now too!
Sam Ewell
Sam just finished his third year of Biomedical Engineering at Penn State. His studies have focused on human biology, so iGEM has been a good opportunity for him to explore plant biology as well. During the summer he helped with the website and the butanol project, but his main focus was running our plant nursery. In order to test all these different ideas we needed a small army of plants and he made sure they grew up to be strong little soldiers. When not studying or caring for plants, he enjoys being the best.
Stephanie Everhart
Stephanie, going into her junior year at Penn State, is a Secondary Education Major in the chemistry option. She hopes to one day become a high school chemistry teacher that can inspire more students to pursue a future in science.  iGEM has given her the opportunity to explore different facets of science, which has proved very rewarding. As part of the iGEM team, Stephanie has focused her efforts on the education outreach aspect of the Human Practices component. Outside of iGEM, Stephanie enjoys running, hiking and indulging in a good movie. In addition, she is a strong advocate for military appreciation as the president of the Dear Hero Program, a student run group on campus that sends letters and care packages to troops overseas.

Dec.2012
IGEM-SCUT team was established. Every members brainstormed and presented their own ideas, then we discussed the feasibility of these ideas.
Jan.2013 to Feb.2013
After consulting our professors, the final project named E.cerevisiae was determined. Our team was divided into three parts, group of gas generating, odorant sensing and modeling. What gave us confidence was that our project was approved by the dean of the school of bioscience & bioengineering in our university (South China University of Technology). What’s more, we had a training camp at our school to learn some theoretical knowledges.
March.2013 to April.2013
Most of us were the first time to do experiments, so we had another training to improve our skills. And we have applied a lab for our project successfully.
April.2013 to present
Experiment started…
April.2013
WEEK 1
At the begining of our experiments,we got to make a plenty of preparation, which included the preparation of the culture medium and the activation of bacterium .
WEEK 2
We still made some preparation for our experiments, in the meantime,we attended our classes. We were enthusiastic to the experiments although most of us had done few experiments. This week,we learned to prepare competent cells of Escherichia Coli (Top 10) and started to cultivating bacterium (Lactobacillus and BL21) using MRS and LB medium. We also did transformation experiments using plasmid and the newly-preparation Top-10 competent cellS.
WEEK 3
We made abstraction of the genome of Lactococcus lactis using the reagents that prepared by ourselves. Meanwhile, we transformed plasmid YEP352 into competent cells(E.coli). We also learned to prepare competent cells of BL21. To amplifiedα-Als gene,we did a PCR experiment.We did authentication of plasmid YEP352 by using enzyme E.coRⅠ.
May.2013
WEEK 1
We made preparation of YPD and FS medium that cultivated saccharomyces cerevisiaea and Vibrio fischeri. We used electrophoresis to examinate the enzyme-digested plasmid. And we had constructed the system of diaceytl. What’s more, we cultivated the Vibrio fischeri into FS medium.
WEEK 2
We learned to do colony PCR to examine whether the target gene had transformed into the bacterium or not. We also used two kinds of restriction enzyme digestion to examine. Abstraction of the genome of Vibrio fischeri was done and the concentration of the genome was measured.
WEEK 3
To cultivate Bacillus thuringiensis, we prepare some ICPM medium. We did electrophoresis to identify the genome of the Vibrio fischer. When the Bacillus thuringiensis had grown,we abstracted its genome.We transformed the PET-22b(+) into competent cells of BL21. We searched the method of examining the diaceytl.(preparation of MR-VP medium)
Oscillating Odorant
July and August
WEEK 1
PET-226(+)-αALS was successfully tested by restriction digest enzyme. We also sent it to be sequenced.   We used IPTG to induce the PET-226(+)-αALS, and the result from the SDS gel electrophoresis showed that we had successfully constructed the system of diaceytl generating.
WEEK 2
We constructed system A:C0060(aiiA+LVA), B:LuxI+LVA, 2:C0062, 5:pluxR, 6:pSB3C5, 7:Q04400(tetR), 8:Psb4a5, 10:GFP.
WEEK 3
aiiA+LVA, LuxI+LVA,pLuxI, pLuxR were successfully authenticated by restriction enzymes digestion, but there was a bad news that restriction digestion of tetR was failed.   We used IPTG to induce the PET-226(+)-αALS, and used standard liquid of diaceytl to react with OPD to get the standard curve. To make sure PET-226(+)-αALS wound not react with peptone during the process of growth, we used the Mq medium. We made a big fault that constructed three wrong systems those days, which because we misunderstood the name of pLuxI,luxR and some genes.
WEEK 4
We used the Biobrick C[K54600], D[I13263],E[K546001] to construct system C+pLuxI and E+Psb3c5.
WEEK 5
We finished the CⅢ construction.
WEEK 6 and 7
We combined C with K2，P5 with K1，SS+SⅢ+ pLuxI+R+Αals+2T.
September to October
WEEK 1
We had constructed a standard Ndh curve.
WEEK 2
Gradient quenching PCR of PET-22b(PT).
Construction of C-Ⅲ+K and CⅢ+PSBⅠK3 .
Authentication of systems of CⅢ+K, CⅢ+PSBⅠK3 by restriction enzyme.
Observation of the fluorescence in systems of CⅢ, CⅢ+SⅢ, CⅢ+K3, CⅢ+PSBⅠK3.
We observed that the systems of CⅢ+SⅢ,CⅢ+K3,CⅢ+PSBⅠK3 showed the fluorescence successfully.
Our immobilization was not quite successful, which the bacterium were scorched.
We made the ligation of PT and IP using SolutionⅠ.
We measured the concentration of ndh in systems of C, C+K, CⅢ , CⅢ+K.
We also measured the intensity of fluorescence , which we found all the systems were OK.
Except the CⅢ+k.
WEEK 3
We found that system CⅢ+SⅢ and PT did not work.We got to pick new colony to cultivate.
We begin making preparation of biobrick dry powder.
Odarant sensing
May
WEEK 4
To amplified the odr-10 and rho,we did PCR.Then we used it to do electrophoresis of which products were retrieved the day after.
July and August
WEEK 1
The third time to construct the system of rho-odr10.
WEEK 2
Rho was successfully amplified by PCR, and we got the transformant of flag-rho-odr10.
WEEK 3
We began to constructing the systems of Ⅰ:rho-flag-odr10, Ⅱ:flag-rho-odr10, Ⅲ:EcoRⅠ-XbaⅠ-rho-odr10-SpeⅠ-PstⅠ, and we got the good news that Ⅱ was finished through the restriction digestion.
WEEK 4
According to the cataphoresis we got the results that flag-odr10 was successfully amplificated by the #10rho-odr10 and #23rho-odr10.
WEEK 5
SⅠsystem was constructed successfully.
We constructed Ⅳ:rho-GFP and it worked.
September
WEEK 1
Authentication of the construction of reporter fus1-BFP-ADH1 was successful.
What is more, we accomplished the construction of the two systems of pGAL1+Flag+Odr-10+GFP+ADH1+Fus1+BFP reporter+ADH1 and pGAL1+Flag+Brho+Odr-10+GFP+ADH1 +Fus1+BFP reporter+ADH1
WEEK 2
We started to prepare our wiki,posters and the presentation.But our experiments still went on .We changed our thoughts about the design of wiki,poster and our uniforms.
WEEK 3
We strove to complete our projects’ wiki and practice the presentation .
WEEK 4
As the competition approaching,we made some preparation for setting out.

Introducing SCUT
South China University of Technology (SCUT) is one of China's key universities operating under the direct leadership of the State Ministry of Education. The university, which has a total area of 294 hectares, is situated in Guangzhou, a southern metropolitan in China. The university has two campuses: The Wushan Campus and Guangzhou Higher Education Mega Center Campus.
South China University of Technology (SCUT), formerly known as the South China Institute of Technology, was established in 1952. In 1960, SCUT was awarded ranked among the key universities of China. In 1981, it was authorized by the State Council to confer doctor degrees and master degrees, and was among the first universities in the country to do so. In 1995, it was selected as one of the universities into which China will make significant investment in the 21st century. In 1999, it was rated ""excellent"" during the Undergraduate Teaching Assessment, and was among the first ""Excellent Universities of Undergraduate Education"" in the country. In the same year, a national science park was established with the authorization of State Ministry of Technology and State Ministry of Education. In 2000, Graduate School was authorized to be established. In 2001, the new cooperative construction of State Ministry of Education and Guangdong Province was implemented in SCUT and it was listed among the top universities in the country. After 60 years of development, SCUT has become a multidisciplinary university focusing on engineering, combined with science, also promoting well coordinated development of management, economics, humanities and law.
With precise knowledge pursuit, the school eminent spirit of comity and factualism has come into being, which help cultivating exclusive technological and management talents that are welcomed to the society. In recent years, the demand of graduate students has exceeded their supply. The employment rate of its undergraduates in 2011 has reached 99.10% and that of its graduates 99.10%. Since its founding, the university has cultivated for the country over 260,000 graduates at all levels. A large number of school fellows have become technological mainstays, distinguished entrepreneurs or leading cadres.
Facing the new century, SCUT will take discipline constructions as pre-requisite, regard individual as its roots, consider talent cultivation as its ultimate aim and highlight technological pursuit. SCUT intends to enlarge and extend its scale and realize the coordinated development of its scale, structure, quality and benefit. SCUT accelerates its education reform by gearing the university from multidiscipline-oriented to integration-oriented, from teaching research-oriented to research-oriented, and from partial open form to completely open form, so as to build SCUT into a top-ranking State university and a famous world-class university.
Our SCUT
Our School
Our School
School of Bioscience and Bioengineering was founded in 2004, located in the scenic south campus of South China University of Technology (SCUT)，covering 10000 square meters. The School owns individual teaching, laboratory building and complete facilities, which create a good environment and development space for discipline construction.
With the rapid development in recent years, our School has formed a sound high-level personnel training system. Nowadays, there are 1058 full-time students in the School, including 754 undergraduates, 253 graduates and 51 PhDs. Our school has a total of 68 staff members of which 89% of the faculty has PhD degree,. There are 10 professors, 22 associate professors, as well as 1 distinguished professor of 1000plan.
Our School presently has 3 undergraduate programs including Bioengineering, Biotechnology, Biomedical Engineering. Our school also offers 6 Master programs as follows, Fermentation Engineering, Biochemical Engineering, Microbiology, Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Biomedical Engineering, Biology Pharmaceuticals. In addition, our school has 6 master degree authorizations for Fermentation Engineering, Biochemical Engineering, Microbiology, Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Biomedical Engineering, Biopharmaceuticals as well as 7doctor degree authorization for Fermentation Engineering, Biochemical Engineering, Microbiology, Biomedical Engineering, Physiology, Genetics, Biochemistry and   Molecular Biology.
In 2007, a first class discipline The Light Industry Technology and Engineering was formed by our school’s Fermentation along with Sugar Engineering as well as Pulp and Paper Engineering which became a national-level key discipline. In 4th 2010, it gained the authority to launch PhD program of first class discipline. According to the discipline background and the need of further development, we will focus on 4 second-class disciplines: Microbiology, Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Physiology and Biophysics as well as Medical Biology. In addition, our school has Post-doctoral mobile station for The Light Industry Technology and Engineering.
Our school has undertaken many major scientific projects, such as national 973 project or national 863 project, and a lot of national or provincial fund projects. We have won 1 national prize for progress in science and technology and 5 provincial prizes. Now we concentrate on the researches of Bioinformatics and Microbial Functional Genomics, Microbial Resources and Regulation of Microbial Metabolism, Molecular Transformation and Enzyme Engineering, Fermentation Engineering and  Fermentation Equipment, Bio-catalytic Processing Engineering, Bioinformatics, Biomechanics, Medical Information and Equipment, and Biomedicine etc.
Our school has a Guangdong Province’s famous-brand major Biology Engineering which becomes the distinctive construction point of high education institute. Besides, Enzymatic Engineering is rated as the national course. Our school insists on the education philosophy of “uphold engineering characteristics, strengthen science studies” throughout the undergraduate courses and training future practical talents for engineering biology. We tightly connect the great demands of national and Guangdong economic and society development, continuously push forward the innovation of technology and personnel training pattern. We set up all kinds of innovation classes to provide more valuable learning opportunities to the talent students.
Since BGI (Beijing Genomics Institute) and our school co-founded a “genomics science” innovation class for two years, there have been a total of 31 co-first authors or byliners publishing 22 high-level papers in top international academic journals ""Nature"" and ""Science"". In order to consolidate the fruits of cooperation and promote further bilateral cooperation in the aspect of personnel training, teacher resources, scientific research, disciplinary platform and internationalization etc, we co-founded SCUT-BGI life science innovation college in April 2010. The Innovation College belongs to jointly conduct the training of undergraduate, graduate and youth teacher.
By virtue of the construction of high-level university and south campus, our School has invested more than 6 million in building a first-class undergraduate teaching laboratory, and it has become the demonstration center of experimental teaching in Guangdong province.
In addition, 30 million has been invested in constructing scientific research platform. The most iconic achievement during the construction is the acquirement of Provincial Key Laboratory in Fermentation and Enzyme engineering, and Key Laboratory in Industrial Biotechnology of Guangdong Educational Department.
Our school actively engages in foreign exchange. We successively established close cooperation with a number of British and American well-known colleges such as Oxford, United Kingdom Imperial College, State University of New Jersey, Camegie Meilun and we also establishes strategic alliance with famous domestic universities and academic institutes. Besides, we hired 2006 Physiology or Medicine Nobel Prize winner, chair professor of University of Massachusetts medical school department of Molecular Medicine, Professor Craig Mello as our honorary professor. At the same time we hired a number of 1000plan winners as our lecture professors or part-time professors.

Philipp Boeing
I have been involved in iGEM at UCL since 2011. This year, apart from advising our undergraduate team, I wanted to try something new with iGEM E. I'm very interested in DIYbio, citizen science in synthetic biology and the lot - so being involved in Darwin's Toolbox excited me a lot.
Bethan Wolfenden
I am a biochemist by background, and I enjoy combining interdisciplinary science with different audiences. I believe experiential learning is the best way to get to grips with new subjects, particularly important emerging technologies like synthetic biology.
Tom Catling
I'm a PhD student in UCL's Optical Science Lab working on thin mirrors for x-ray telescopes. I enjoy making all sorts of stuff and met the other IGEM E team members through UCL's Institute of Making. Biotech is a really interesting field and I firmly believe in a technically and scientifically literate society, so I thought this project sounded very interesting.
Oliver Coles
I'm a PhD student in astronomical instrumentation, specifically focusing on optics, data analysis and target selection for future spectrographic instruments designed to probe dark energy. As a fan of the open source hardware and maker movement I'm excited to be able to work on a project to enable a wider group of people to have fun with biotech.
Desmond Schofield
I am a EngD student in the Department of Biochemical Engineering at UCL working on the production of a biotherapeutic protein for a novel cancer therapy. I enjoy interdisciplinary work and the application and commercialisation of scientific concepts. I am excited to be involved with Darwin's toolbox as it is a chance to expand the use of synthetic biology into new areas and gives me an opportunity to take a hands-on approach to bringing a technology to market.

Philipp Boeing
I have been involved in iGEM at UCL since 2011. This year, apart from advising our undergraduate team, I wanted to try something new with iGEM E. I'm very interested in DIYbio, citizen science in synthetic biology and the lot - so being involved in Darwin's Toolbox excited me a lot.
Bethan Wolfenden
I am a biochemist by background, and I enjoy combining interdisciplinary science with different audiences. I believe experiential learning is the best way to get to grips with new subjects, particularly important emerging technologies like synthetic biology.
Tom Catling
I'm a PhD student in UCL's Optical Science Lab working on thin mirrors for x-ray telescopes. I enjoy making all sorts of stuff and met the other IGEM E team members through UCL's Institute of Making. Biotech is a really interesting field and I firmly believe in a technically and scientifically literate society, so I thought this project sounded very interesting.
Oliver Coles
I'm a PhD student in astronomical instrumentation, specifically focusing on optics, data analysis and target selection for future spectrographic instruments designed to probe dark energy. As a fan of the open source hardware and maker movement I'm excited to be able to work on a project to enable a wider group of people to have fun with biotech.
Desmond Schofield
I am a EngD student in the Department of Biochemical Engineering at UCL working on the production of a biotherapeutic protein for a novel cancer therapy.

TEAM PROFILE
This year, UCL has a highly interdisciplinary team of eleven undergraduates, all with strong and often conflicting views on what our project is, how it should be done, and what it could become in the future, but all genuinely delighted to be trying to bring synthetic biology to the brain.
ATTRIBUTIONS
A great number of people, scientists and non-scientists, have helped our project to come to life. We have received invaluable advice and inspiration, and would like to recognise their contributions here. Indeed, it has been a genuine pleasure to work with all of them.
PRESS
UCL has a strong background in iGEM, and we are looking to build on excellent foundations this year. As such, we are publicising several interactive aspects of our human practices, most notably “Eternal Sunshine” and our Creative Writing Competition, and are hoping to generate significant media attention through our efforts.

SUPERVISORS
Dr. Darren Nesbeth
Lecturer in Synthetic and Molecular Biology. Supervisor and overall co-ordinator of iGEM at UCL. Lecturer in Synthetic Biology at the Department of Biochemical Engineering, who has been responsible for overseeing the iGEM competition at UCL for many years! Loves to eat porridge and watch vintage VHS films when away from iGEM planning.
Philipp Boeing
Msc Computer Science. Human Practice Supervisor. I have been leading iGEM teams at UCL since 2011, including last year’s Plastic Republic team. This year, I principally supervise team Spotless Mind on Human Practice, as well as general iGEM best practice. Apart from iGEM, I spend my time on SynBioSoc and DIYbio. Diversity!
Yanika Borg
PhD Student. Bacterial Lab Supervisor. When I’m not working on my PhD in Synthetic Biology, I am supervising Spotless Mind’s bacterial team. My role is to oversee all experiments carried out on E. coli, to demonstrate molecular cloning techniques to the team, and to calm Andy down on a daily basis. This is my second year supervising iGEM at UCL, and I love the whole experience.
Alex Kinna
PhD Student. Mammalian Lab Supervisor. I am a 2nd year PhD student studying biochemical and protein engineering. My role is to advise and support mammalian cell culture, testing of circuits in mammalian cells and production of target proteins.
SCIENTIFIC ADVICE
In the course of the development of our idea, we consulted synthetic biologists, neuroscientists, neurosurgeons, psychiatrists and geneticists and took on board their feedback in order to develop our idea and add the detail to our genetic circuit. We show what advice we received here and how this advice was incorporated into our final project.
Dr. Jeremy Cook is a senior lecturer and the programme tutor for the Neuroscience Bsc at UCL. His research interests concern the development the visual system, including the embryonic emergence of retinal cell patterns. He advised us to carefully consider the neurosurgical implications of our project, noting the preferability of an autograph of microglia, and the need to design our circuit so that the microglia only become de-activated at plaques, because a degree of activation is required for chemotaxis.
Dr. John Scholes is an honorary senior lecturer, and lectures on the Neuroscience Bsc course at UCL. He supported the idea of using BDNF in the circuit in order to stop cell cycle re-entry in AD and suggested ApoE as a possible circuit component, as it could increase the activity of our chosen protease.
Dr. Jennifer Pococks' research involves cell signaling in neurodegenerative dieseases and this onvolves the study of microglia in the context of AD. She advised the team on using microglia in the lab.
Professor Patrick Haggard is a prominent figure in neuroethical debate, Patrick Haggard is a neuroscientist at the Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience and the Department of Psychology, UCL. We are thankful to him for providing inspiration and being a sounding board for our neuroethical investigations, and for agreeing to be filmed as part of our documentary.
Professor John Powell is a geneticist in the Department of Neuroscience and Psychological Medicine at Kings College London. His research interests are in the application of human genetics to the study of neurological and psychiatric disorders; in schizophrenia and autism. He helped direct our theoretical work on how synthetic neurobiology could be expanded to different brain conditions, therapies and enhancements.
Professor Stephen Hart works on gene therapy at Wolfson Centre for Gene Therapy of Childhood Disease, UCL. We are thankful for him on his advice concerning how to transfect native microglia in vivo. By pure serendipity we found that he and his research team had developed a method of transfecting microglia in vivo using lipid-peptide nanocomplexes. This result of his was un-expected as his team had been trying to transfect cancerous cells in rat brains but increases the feasibility of our idea.
Dr. Tammy Cheng and Dr. Paul Bates are scientists at the BMM lab at Cancer Research UK that envisioned and helped team member Alex create and run a bioinformatics network analysis programme, as well serving as discussing our ideas more generally and so helping to improve them.
OTHER ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
Dr. Howard Boland is a multidisciplinary practitioner with a background in science and art. Howard is the artistic director and found of the organisation C-Lab. He holds an interest in contemporary arts and is very active in ""Art from Synthetic Biology"". He advised us on how to improve our Speed debate event.
Shirley Nurock is the Coordinator of the London Area Research Network in Alzheimer's Society. She holds experience as a carer and researcher in Alzheimer's Disease. She was a main speaker at our Speed debate event, where she underlined the desperation for a new way to tackle this tragic disease and warned about the ethics of over hyping our treatment.
Lubmilla Ruban is a stem cell biologist in UCL's Biochemical Engineering Department, who manages the Cell Culture, Cell Bioprocessing and the Liquid Nitrogen facilities. We are thankful to her for teaching us the basics of mammalian cell culture, including how to passage cells and how to use the essential equipment of the mammalian labs.
Sean Tuite is a first year undergraduate film student to whom we owe thanks for his help in creating our documentary as cameraman and editor.
Annie Wei is a PhD student of the UCL Biochemical Engineering department who offered us supervision and support with lab work

Meet the team!
Kong Khai Jien
PhD student in Application of Synthetic Biology to T Cell Engineering at UCL Cancer Institute. Previously did BSc Biotechnology.
Why iGEM:
I enjoy the fun of programming genetics and the associated vibrant community. My brain is constantly stimulated by thinking about the possibilities of what we can play with. Carrying out an idea as a team, interacting with other teams, thinking about the different techniques and discovering new knowledge, it is so great to be part of it!
Cassandra Stowe
I have an undergraduate degree in Human Biology from the University of Birmingham and a masters in Cancer from UCL. I have just started my PhD at the UCL Cancer Institute, in conjunction with the UCL Centre for Advanced Biomedical Imaging, creating optical genetic reporters.
Why iGEM:
I wanted to do iGEM because I thought it would be a great experience that would enable me to apply my science background to a new challenge.
Ranvir Chaudhri
Student at UCL studying a masters in Biochemical Engineering. Previously did an undergraduate degree in Honours Biochemistry.
Why iGEM:
Because synthetic biology is awesome. The beauty and sheer multitude of nature is so amazing my mind is constantly being blown. So many materials and systems exist in biology and the human race is just beginning to mimic them. I'm doing my part to make it happen.
Thomas Stahl
I am a second year PhD student at UCLs Department of Medical Physics and Bioengineering, developing Contrast Agents for the use in Medical Imaging, especially Photoacoustic Imaging. Before this I did MRes at UCL, producing a setup for Photoacoustic spectroscopic measurements.
Why iGEM:
I believe public engagement is a great challenge for cutting edge research. iGEM has drawn wide public attention towards Biological Engineering and its impact and promotes public discussions, which is a great achievement. Working together with a great team, I urged to take the opportunity to contribute to and be part of iGEM 2013.
Hugh Jarman
Student at UCL studying a masters in Biochemical Engineering. Previously did an undergraduate degree in Biotechnology and Management at Imperial College London.
Why iGEM:
I've always wanted to do iGEM. I missed out on it during my undergraduate degree and when I saw that the postgraduate team is being introduced I thought it was an excellent opportunity. I was drawn to iGEM in the first place due to the chance to apply my knowledge and skills learnt at university to do some cool science.
Shahin Heshmatifar
Student at UCL studying a MSc in Biochemical Engineering. Previously studied an undergraduate degree in Biomedical Sciences at University of Westminster.
Why iGEM:
I had followed iGEM distantly during my undergraduate degree. I found  its concept and deliverable very interesting. After starting my post graduate degree at UCL, I found that there will be a post grad iGEM competition this year. I therefore decided to grab this opportunity by participating in the project to apply and enhance my knowledge in molecular and synthetic biology.
Meet our supervisors!
Amit Jathoul
iGEM supervisor. Postdoc in molecular genetic imaging in Martin Pule's lab at UCL Cancer Institute and centre for advanced biomedical imaging.

Students
David Yao
Class of 2013
Major: Neuroscience
I joined the UCLA iGEM team to explore new scientific frontiers and tackle challenges with a team of passionate, inspiring, and awesome individuals! My independent research focuses on profiling the transcriptional networks that regulate the kinetics of cellular reprogramming from a differentiated to a stem cell-state. I am fascinated by the subtle genetic and epigenetic changes that program enigmatic organs and complex cellular processes -- as well as the events that can disrupt them and lead to disease.
Chelsea Hu

Ruosang Qiu
It is great for a team to have an omniscient advisor, even better an inspiring one. Ruosang Qiu , our beloved advisor, definitely is offering both. Her hard work as well as undoubted adorable personality is the motivation of our team members' efforts, her clear mind combined with provident planning lays the foundation of our successful project, To quote her words: I' was a happy iGEMer in 2012, I'm going to make you all happy iGEMers in 2013.
Xin Wu
The past three years have seen his tremendous dedication to iGEM, Xin Wu, a passionate team member in XMU China 2011, a devoted team leader in XMU China 2012 and now, an invaluable advisor in XMU Software 2013. Had it not been Xin Wu's constant encouragement and guidance, we,the inexperienced iGEMers might have been faint-hearted and failed to face up to the challenges during the process. It is drawing on his expertise in synthetic biology and proficiency in iGEM competition that we have solved the seemingly unsolvable and conquered the seemingly unconquerable.
Youbin Mo
Youbin Mo is one of the great advisors of XMU software team in 2013. As a computational biophysicist, y, he is an unquestionable master of biological model and computer programming.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENT
All work described on this wiki or on our parts registry pages was done by iGEM Team XMU Software 2013. We managed to finish the whole project, from planning, financing to the complete dry and wet lab work by ourselves. Nevertheless we could not have done all this work without the help, advice and guidance of several people. Therefore, special thanks to the following people:
1. Team XMU China, the wet lab team of our university, gave us a hand to construction work.
2. Tina Zhang, the advisor of team XMU China, helped us in experiments, especially in site-specific mutagenesis and PCR.
3. Prof. Zhiliang Ji, College of Life Science, provided us with valuable guidance in choosing the project.
4. Prof. Shoufa Han, provided us with many instruments such as ELISA reader to test the fluorescence.
5. Qiang Kou, the previous team leader of SYSU-Software team, gives us lots of help.
6. Wenjun Rao, a shy boy from XMU Software College, build the beautiful interfaces for Brick Worker.
7. Wenyao Shao, a nice guy who allowed us use the room 105 as our camp for a whole summer vacation.
8. There are many friends we met during the last year, NJU China, SUSTC-SHENZHEN-B, USTC-Software and so on. Thank you for your supporting.
9. Our sponsors: Xiamen University and Mathwork.

Xiamen, also known as Amoy to the west, is a cozy city located in the southeastern part of China, and has a relaxing coastal charm with a population of 1.3 million. It's a historical harbor city which was founded in the mid-14 century, in the early years of the Ming Dynasty. In the early 1980's, Xiamen was declared as one of China's first Special Economic Zone, taking advantages of the city's heritage as a trading center and the proximity to Taiwan. In 2004 the city won the finals of the world's Human Settlements and Environment Award, ""Nations in Bloom"". Xiamen is one of China's most attractive and best-maintained resort city, and attracts a large number of foreign and local tourists. The city is easily accessible by air, and there are direct flights from Hong Kong, Kuala Lumpur, Osaka, Seoul, Singapore and Tokyo. Within China, Xiamen airport is linked to more than 30 domestic airports.

Brief self-introduction
Jingyi Liu
My name is Liu Jingyi and I'm a Chinese girl with a height of 174 cm and long curly hair.I love shopping like many girls and sports,especially cycling.I love biology very much,for it's amazing to know about ourselves and doing experiments to find out something new is really attractive.I hope we can achieve our idea on prisoner's dilemma.
Jingnong Wang
My name is Wang Jingnong and I am a sophomore at SUSTC. Fascinated by the vitality and mystery of plants and animals, I fell in love with biology when I was at a young age. I was introduced to synthetic biology by IGEM, which gives me a precious chance to do research in relevant area.So far, I have been learning a lot about synthetic biology, biological process lab work and teamwork skills with my friends. It was quite a big challenge to comprehend so much material in such a short time, but I am having a wonderful time since I am able to get in depth with something I truly enjoy!
Jian Cui
My name is Cui Jian .I'm now the team leader of this iGEM team .I am 19 years old ,and was born in Jiangsu Province ,China .Generally speaking ,I am hardworking when doing the things that I am interested in .But what puzzles me most is my poor English .It's a great honor for me to have the chance join this year's iGEM Jamboree.
Zi Wang
I am from the Igem 2013 SUSTC-Shenzhen-A team and you can call me WangZi. I am fond of designs of various synthetic biology accompyed by many interesting experiments. As for my characters,I am active but a little shy,which I desire to overcome through this competiton. I am glad that I have this chance to know more friends and attend the jamboree with you guys from all over the world
Ningyuan Yang
Hey friends! Who you are staring at is a happy guy from SUSTC, he likes almost everything comes into his life and wants to have a well comprehension of them. So he joins the Igem to try to have some fresh things as well as make some difference. Who knows what he will meet there. Maybe at last someone would remember there was once a guy named Ningyuan Yang.
Dan Chen
Hi ! I’m Dan Chen . You can call me Donna too . I’m outgoing and easygoing , and I love making new friends . Biology will be my major course in the next two years . I think biology is very interesting . We could explore nature 、ourselves and almost everything . And I think what igemers have done is amazing . I feel so lucky that I could join in our project.
Yan Dai
My name is Yan DAI. I am interested in molecular biology and organic chemistry. I got lots of experience and knowledge in iGEM, which were hard to get in class. The process is tough but meaningful. We met some difficulties in the lab, but dealing with them is quite fun. And I really enjoy the time with my teammates.
Yan He
Hi everyone! I am Yan He who always smile. I am interested in Synthetic biology and it is my great honor to take part in this competition, this summer in the lab was so unforgettable. In my spare time, I enjoy watching movie and listen to the music, and I also like reading some books about psychology.
Yingzhe Shu
My name is Yingzhe Shu, and you can also call me Vincent Shu. I’m a sophomore from the South University of Science and Technology of China. And I feel so excited that I can take part in iGEM this summer.
I’m a sports’ fan. So in my spare time, I like to go outsides and do all kinds of sports. But soccer is my favourite. I’m also the top player in our school soccer team. I also enjoy the time when I listen to the music, especially the American and European pop music.
I learned so much during this summer with iGEM. And I hope you all enjoy it too!
Zhuoteng Peng
Try to make everything elegant and simple.

Strains and Growth Media
E.coli Top10 was used for all the experiments and grown in Luria–Bertani (LB) medium or M9 minimal medium using glycerol as the carbon source. Kanamycin (10 μg/mL), ampicillin (50 μg/mL) and chloramphenicol (170 μg/mL) were added as appropriate.
Six Kinds of Protocols
Protocol 1 E.coli was grown overnight in LB medium at 37 °C and then diluted 100-fold in fresh LB medium in 96-well plates (Corning Incorporated, 3599). Then each culture (200 μL) was induced for 12 hours at 30°C with inducers of different concentrations. Then the fluorescence intensity of cultures was measured by microplate reader (Thermo) or LSRFortessa flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). Protocol 2 E.coli was grown overnight in LB medium at 37 °C and then diluted 100-fold in fresh LB medium in 96-well plates (Corning Incorporated, 3599). After 3 hours’ culture at 30 °C, each culture (200 μL) was induced for 7 hours with inducers of different concentrations. Then the fluorescence intensity of cultures was measured by microplate reader (Thermo) or LSRFortessa flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). Protocol 3 E.coli was grown overnight in LB medium at 37 °C and then diluted 100-fold in fresh LB medium in 96-well plates (Corning Incorporated, 3599). After 6 hours’ culture at 30 °C, each culture (200 μL) was centrifuged at 4000 r.p.m. for 10 minutes and was suspended in 200 μL of fresh LB medium containing inducers of different concentrations for 4 hours. Then the fluorescence intensity of cultures was measured by microplate reader (Thermo) or LSRFortessa flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). Protocol 4 E.coli was grown overnight in LB medium at 37 °C and then diluted 100-fold in fresh LB medium in 96-well plates (Corning Incorporated, 3599). Then each culture (200 μL) was induced for 12 hours at 37°C with inducers of different concentrations. Then the fluorescence intensity of cultures was measured by microplate reader (Thermo) or LSRFortessa flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). Protocol 5 E.coli was grown overnight in LB medium at 37 °C and then diluted 100-fold in fresh M9 minimal medium in 96-well plates (Corning Incorporated, 3599). Then each culture (200 μL) was induced for 12 hours at 30°C with inducers of different concentrations. Then the fluorescence intensity of cultures was measured by microplate reader (Thermo) or LSRFortessa flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). Protocol 6 E.coli was grown overnight in LB medium at 37 °C and then diluted 100-fold in fresh M9 minimal medium in microcentrifuge tubes (1.5 mL, Axygen). Then each culture (200 μL) was induced for 12 hours at 30°C with inducers of different concentrations. Then the fluorescence intensity of cultures was measured by microplate reader (Thermo) or LSRFortessa flow cytometer (BD Biosciences).
Four Types of Test
Primary Test Primary Test aims to investigate whether a particular biosensor could be induced by the aromatic compounds mentioned in previous studies. Inducers (summarized from previous studies) were added into the LB medium at 1000 μM (for the non-cytotoxic compounds) or 100 μM (for the cytotoxic compounds). ON-OFF Test ON-OFF Test functions to determine aromatic compounds that can induce a certain biosensor. 78 aromatic compounds were individually added into the LB medium at 1000 μM (for the non-cytotoxic compounds), 100 μM (for the cytotoxic compounds) or 10μM (for benzene). (For detail of all the compounds, Click Here ). Dose-response Curve Test Dose-response Curve Test is to deeply characterize the relationship between fluorescence intensity (or induction ratio) and the concentration of inducers. Inducers summarized from ON-OFF Test were individually added into the LB medium at concentration ranging from micro-molar to mili-molar. Orthogonality Test Orthogonality Test aims to prove that a compound which is not an inducer will not influence the detection of inducers. Two kinds of aromatic compounds (one is an inducer while the other isn’t for a particular biosensor) were added together into the LB medium at concentration ranging from micro-molar to mili-molar.
Two Methods for Fluorescence Intensity Measurement and Data Analysis
Microplate Reader E.coli were harvested by centrifugation at 4000 r.p.m. for 10 minutes and then resuspended in 200 μl of PBS (phosphate-buffered saline). OD600 and GFPuv fluorescence (excitation 485 nm and emission 515 nm) was measured using microplate reader (Thermo). As for the data analysis, OD600 and fluorescence intensity of PBS measured in the same way was subtracted as blank. Fluorescence intensity of each well was normalized by OD600 of the same well. The average of fluorescence intensity was obtained from three replicates performed on different 96-well plates. Flow cytometry analysis Flow cytometer data were obtained using an LSRFortessa flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). All the data were gated by forward and side scatter, and each data consists of at least 10,000 cells. The geometry mean fluorescence was calculated with FlowJo. The average of means was obtained from three replicates performed on different 96-well plates.

Aura Ferreiro
I am a 5th year undergraduate majoring in Biological Systems Engineering. I enjoy playing my ukulele and coming up with ways to integrate quinoa and tofu into every meal I cook. I plan to apply for graduate programs in the same field I study now, and look forward to a career in design and modeling of industrial biological systems, or of synthetic biological devices with commercial applications.
Amy Soon
I am a senior majoring in Biomedical Engineering and specializing in Systems and Synthetic Biology. Outside of school and the lab, I enjoy fantasy and mystery stories in tv shows, games or novels. I am still in the process of deciding on my future career path and whether I will go to graduate school directly after graduating or take some time off to get work experience first. I hope to be able to continue working with synthetic biology in a career in industry.
Alex Neckelmann
I am a Senior majoring in Biotechnology with an emphasis in microbiology and awesome. When I’m not at school, I enjoy playing tennis or reading biographies. I plan on graduating and applying to graduate school in the fall. After graduate school, I would really enjoy working on projects involved in bioremediation or optimizing industrial bioprocesses through synthetic biology.
David Hwang
Hi, I'm David Hwang, and I'm entering my fourth year as a Computer Science major this coming fall. My current professional interests are computer science applications in healthcare, education, and clearly, biology. My unprofessional interests are ultimate frisbee (I am on the school's club team where we placed in the top 8 in the nation this past year), and cooking.
Lucas Murray
Hi, I am a third year biomedical engineering major with an emphasis in systems and synthetic biology. When I'm not going back and forth between labs, I enjoy competitive sailing, freediving, and underwater photography. If I had free time, you'd find me doing any of those three. My main background is in instrumentation and chemistry, but my academic focus is on synthetic biology, biophysics, and molecular biology. I plan to apply to graduate school next fall, where I would like to continue to study synthetic biology.

Welcome to The UC Davis iGEM Team
This year we put  together a small team of cross-disciplinary undergraduates to tackle our iGEM project. This group has worked hard over the past months to bring their idea for combining TAL repressor proteins and riboswitches to yield a novel device for modular expression control. Our experienced group of faculty and graduate advisors have supported the team with valuable guidance.
