Team:Minnesota/Team
From 2008.igem.org
The Minnesota iGEM '08 team consists  of groups working on two different projects. One team is located primarily in Minneapolis and is designing a comparator for their project. The other team is based in St. Paul and is working on a time bomb.
Team Comparator
Control systems are an integral component of almost all aspects of life. Whether it is in industrial, biological, or chemical applications, controllers provide a way to keep systems functioning properly. A vital part of any control system is the comparator. This component compares a set point value and a measured value, and determines which is larger. It then sends the appropriate signal to the controller, which reacts to bring the system back to the set point. In typical applications, the controller equipment is electronic. However, our team set out to create a comparator using only genetic components. This comparator could potentially be used as part of a new, solely biological control system that could be used to treat many diseases afflicting humans, for example diabetes. This comparator could compare the blood sugar of a patient to what it should be, and send this result to a control system that could compensate, for example by changing the levels of insulin.
In order to undertake this task, a system involving six genes was designed. For our system, the two inputs (one representing the set point and one representing the measured value) are IPTG and ATC. These inputs will activate the transcription of the LacI and TetR proteins, and set in motion the rest of the system to produce the outputs. Depending on the amounts of the two inducer molecules added to the system, either green fluorescent protein (GFP) or red fluorescent protein(RFP) will be produced. The actual design of the system can be seen below. In order to complete this project, a total of six genes will have to be cloned into plasmids, and two new BioBrick parts will be produced. One will be a TetR and p22-MNT dual-repressed promoter, and the other will be a LacI and lambdaphage cI dual-repressed promoter. We will also build mathematical models and conduct computer simulations that will help with the designs. This project will pave the way for other parts of a true genetic PID controller to be produced, which could be an exciting scientific development in the near future.

What we did & collaboration with other iGEM 2008 Teams
Paolo Magni and colleagues wanted to introduce Biomedical Engineering students into Synthetic Biology. So, he decided to get some information from Silvio Cavalcanti group (Bologna University), who already worked in this field. At the beginning of 2008 Paolo Magni visited Bologna University labs, located in Cesena, to understand what kind of wet lab resources were necessary to develop a Synthetic Biology project and, discussing with Silvio Cavalcanti and Francesca Ceroni from Bologna group, the iGEM competition seemed to be the right opportunity to start a project. Because Engineering faculty in Pavia had not the required facilities, it was necessary to involve Maria Gabriella Cusella, who leads a Molecular Biology lab in a structure that already worked with Engineering faculty (Center for Tissue Engineering). Then they started selecting students to build up the iGEM team. They chose one Biomedical Engineering master student, Lorenzo Pasotti, one Molecular Biology master student, Mattia Quattrocelli, and a lab advisor, Daniela Galli. In the first weeks of April, Lorenzo trained Mattia about Digital Electronics principles and mathematical modeling. In the meanwhile, Mattia trained Lorenzo about wet lab work. The training included a presentation of all the lab instrumentation, basic Microbiology and Molecular Biology protocols and safety issues. These activities allowed the two students to learn the preliminary skills to start a multidisciplinary collaboration and then they started to get information from literature and from the Registry, to understand what kind of original device they could design. After some weeks they two chose a project and, after some meetings with the other team members, they begun project implementation when Spring 2008 DNA Distribution arrived. The two students worked together in lab to build up and test the designed devices. They also organized periodic meetings with the team instructors to discuss about project progress. Daniela Galli supervised students' wet lab activity and was always ready to help to solve specific biological problems. During our activities, we found very useful to keep in touch with Bologna iGEM Team to share doubts and issues about the work. In particular, several conference calls were organized and two meetings were scheduled in Pisa and Bressanone (Italy). It was fundamental to compare lab protocols and techniques to help each other avoiding mistakes and speeding up project progress. The main topics of our discussion were the optimization of plasmid resuspension and ligation reaction steps as well as how to measure fluorescence. Finally, before DNA Repository quality control publication on the Registry web site, we cross-checked some parts that showed problems after DNA transformation. Problems had been confirmed by quality control results (parts' sequences classified as ""inconsistent""). In particular, we were interested in red light sensor parts (see ""notebook"" section for more information).
Where we're from
Pavia is a town of south-western Lombardy, northern Italy, 35 km south of Milan on the lower Ticino river near its confluence with the Po. It has a population of about 71,000.
Pavia is the capital of a fertile province known for agricultural products including wine, rice, cereals, and dairy products. Some industries located in the suburbs do not disturb the peaceful atmosphere which comes from the preservation of the city's past and the climate of study and meditation associated with its ancient University. The University of Pavia, together with the IUSS (Institute for Advanced Studies of Pavia), the Ghislieri College, the Borromeo College, the Nuovo College, the Santa Caterina College and the EDiSU, belongs to the Pavia Study System.
Pavia University is one of the oldest universities in Europe and the oldest one in Lombardy. Since its foundation in 1361 it has been a good place to study for both Italian and foreign students.
Each year, thousands of students can appreciate the multidisciplinary vocation of our University and the hospitality of its campus, really unique in Italy for the possibility it offers of living and studying in a lively, intellectually challenging environment.
The University of Pavia today:
3 hospitals
9 faculties
15 colleges
20 master degrees
35 libraries
49 departements
54 specialization schools
104 degree couses
310 exchange relationships over the world
1.120 professors
1.600 study grants
4.000 graduated each year
23.000 students

The Team
METU_Turkey team was established by the four undergraduate students a year ago with their own sole efforts. Then size of the team was increased to six. To represent METU in the forthcoming competition our team was established in February,2008. We greatly appreciate former pariticipants of IGEM competition Koray, Milas,Sinem for their efforts in establishment of our team, for their support in the whole project and for their assistance in the administrative problems that we have faced so far. Our current team is composed of sixteen undergraduate students majoring in Molecular Biology and Genetics and Biology. Being member of this large team we are enjoying to have several advantages over other team. Apart from having strong potential to create astounding project, we are learning how to act within the group and how to act as a team.
We would like to thank research assistants Tahir Bayrac, Tufan Oz and Serkan Tuna without whom our project would not work.  As a team, besides participating in the Jamboree, one of our main aims is to increase the awareness towards Synthetic Biology in Turkey. For this, we would also like to thank our sponsors TUBITAK and METIS for their support.
The Project
Light controlled heavy metal carrying E. coli machine
Heavy metals are  natural components of the Earth's crust. They cannot be degraded or destroyed. To a small extent they enter our bodies via food, drinking water and air. As trace elements, some heavy metals (e.g. copper, selenium, zinc) are essential to maintain the metabolism of the human body. However, at higher concentrations they can lead to poisoning. Heavy metal poisoning could result, for instance, from drinking-water contamination (e.g. lead pipes), high ambient air concentrations near emission sources, or intake via the food chain.
We designed a E.coli machine to  control heavy metal concentration in water  by using phototaxis induced tunable carrying system on E.coli membrane.  In our system, there are two light sources. One of them is for the metal source and another is for the destination to where we want to carry metal atoms. And our machines have phototaxis ability. In addition to this, they have metal binding domain in outer surface and bacteriorhodopsin. When we open light at the metal source, they start to move toward source and catch the metal atoms. Then we open the light at the destination while closing the light at the source. So our machines move toward the destination. After the arrival our machines will be exposed to light with specific wavelength to activate bacteriorhodopsin leading to small local pH changing at the outer surface. This pH changing causes the release of metal atoms from the metal binding domain. Eventually, system starts from the beginning and so on.

What we did
For iGEM 2008, we spent the summer adapting heterochromatin/silencing as a novel controller for gene expression in synthetic biology. The idea to work in the area of heterochromatin arose in early 2008 as part of discussions between the Lim lab and George Cachianes (Lincoln High School biotech program director), who had introduced his students to epigenetics earlier in the year. Andrew and Nili (Lim Lab) met with the participating Lincoln High students several times in April and May to discuss epigenetics, brainstorm project ideas, and get the students started on an after-school “pre-project”, investigating whether over-expression of a panel of chromatin-related genes might enhance our ability to silence transgenic loci (it does, see our project page!).
In several group discussions at the beginning of the summer, we identified a range of synthetic biology goals that might benefit from the use of heterochromatin/silencing. The concept of a “yeast immune system” arose in these discussions—essentially, yeast engineered to differentiate at the epigenetic level in response to detection of a pathogen. We then spent the rest of the summer working up and characterizing the parts that would be necessary to build it (3 months goes fast)! Thus, yeast will have to remain immune-compromised a little while longer…
Who did it?
As part of his postdoctoral work studying feedback at the level of the histone tail, Andrew Horwitz established the original LexA-Sir2/LexA operators system.
All other work was completed by the students, with mentorship and technical advice from their buddies:
During their pre-project in May/June, the Lincoln High School Students, under the supervision of George Cachianes, cloned a panel of chromatin-related genes into yeast over-expression vectors and identified Sir3 and Ssn8 as factors that were limiting for silencing. This was later used to “push” weakly silenced bits, expanding the range of promoters that could be silenced.
Willis Wong (Inputs group) explored alternative inputs for the induction of silencing, including GPCR-mediated signaling and light inducible dimerization.
Alex Ng and Ryan Quan (Silencing Group) investigated the relationship between promoter strength and silencing by generating a “matrix” of yeast strains with variations on the basic silencing bit. This work defined the range of promoters that can be used for synthetic silencing of a given target promoter. They also demonstrated that silencing is dominant over moderate transcriptional activators.
Jimmy Huang cloned and tested the regional silencing constructs, and also worked on feedback mechanisms to “lock in” silencing.
Leeza Sergeeva and Tiffany Saw, of the Antisilencing Group, worked on developing ways to un-silence a gene. Leeza also helped with the modeling effort and tested the Shuttle vector system by converting a few candidate AarI parts into BioBricks.
As part of the Outputs group, Jacinto Chen and Cathy Liu worked on silencing alternative genes (e.g. filamentation mediators, antimicrobial peptide genes).
Jacinto Chen also characterized the distance dependence of silencing and is working on identifying sequence elements that enhance (protosilencers) or limit (boundary elements) the spread of heterochromatin.
Andrej Ondracka worked on the modeling project with Angi Chau, Cihan Oguz, and Hana El-Samad. In the lab, Andrej constructed and tested alternative DNA binding domain/operator pairs (e.g. Tet repressor fusion targeted to Tet operators, LacI fusion to Lac operators etc) to facilitate the construction of a heterochromatin-based toggle switch. Andrej also designed a shuttle vector for conversion of AarI parts into the BioBrick format.
Dan Lu conducted the cooperativity/timecourse experiments using a dual-fluor strain constructed by Alex Ng.
The presentation was designed by the presenters, Andrej, Cathy and Tiffany, with help from Raquel Gomes, Andrew Horwitz and Wendell Lim.
All team members contributed to building the wiki, which was coordinated by Raquel Gomes.
Many thanks to Arsenia deGuzman, who maintained media stocks, glassware and other necessities.

iGEM 2008 at USU
TEAM USU BACKGROUND
Utah State University is proud to be involved in the 2008 iGEM competition for its first year.  The 2008 USU iGEM team consists of 4 graduate, 5 undergraduate, and 2 high school students under the supervision of faculty with backgrounds in Biological Engineering, Electrical Engineering, Biology, and Microbiology. Though many project topics were seriously discussed, the team chose to study a method of monitoring polyhydroxybutyrate production in microorganisms by inserting a reporter in the PHB operon. This project was selected because of its potential to make the PHB production process more efficient and cost effective by creating a simple system for determining the optimum time for PHB extraction.

Team Member Contributions
Junling Huo is a PhD student in Biological Engineering who served as an advisor for the iGEM team. He helped to answer student questions, and guide such experimental activities as primer design, electrophoresis, and DNA purification. His personal research is on Rhodobacter sphaeroides, a photosynthetic bacterium.
Stephen Merrigan is currently working on a MS in Biological Engineering at Utah State studying biodiesel production from algae, and has a background in Microbiology. Stephen's primary role was as an advisor for the project. During the first few months of the project Stephen did background research on project topics. He also helped with lab work when necessary, including DNA purification. Stephen also advised on the wiki construction.
Joseph Camire advised on targeting the amplification of the full phaCAB cassette and phaC gene,optimizing the PCR process and testing of primer sets with and without prefix and suffix regions. His work also involved sequence determination and analysis of the phaCAB cassette contained in the source plasmid. He also guided work on the phaC gene, which included targeting at amplification and preparing the gene for site-directed mutagenesis for removal of a critical restriction enzyme site prior to ligation of a new phaCAB cassette for biobrick construction.
Kirsten Sims is a first-year graduate student at Utah State University in Biological and Irrigation Engineering. She received her Bacherlor's degree from Gonzaga University in Biology. Her research focuses on the development of cellulose-derived biofuel. As a member of the USU iGEM team, she was involved in the development and design of the project, as well as participation in the laboratory procedures. She also contributed to the development of the wiki by providing an abstract of the project.
Trent Mortensen is a finishing senior in Biological Engineering.  His main research direction is biomedical in nature, using herbal antibiotics as possible alternatives for disease treatment.  As part of the USU iGEM team, he played an active role in the planning of the project, group coordination, advising professor consultation, laboratory work, ordering of materials, lab maintenance, Wiki preparation, documentation, and presentation preparations throughout the course of the project.
Elisabeth Linton is a Biological Engineering student. Her research is focused on polyhydroxyalkanoates. For the iGEM team, Libbie helped in project determination and planning, as well as literature review and topic research. She also carried out work in the laboratory like restriction enzyme digestions, gel electrophoresis, DNA isolation, and bacterial transformations. She was also responsible for coordinating efforts and organizing the wiki.
Daniel Nelson is pursuing a degree in Biological Engineering and his current personal research project is “Omega-3 Fatty Acid Production and Extraction in Schizochytrium limacinum SR21.” He has enjoyed participating in group discussions as project ideas and direction have been determined. In the lab, he has worked with the team to isolate, purify, and analyze the key DNA promoters for the PHB synthesis gene. He hopes that through study of these promoter regions, the team will find a way to increase PHB production and create a general gene expression system to monitor cellular product accumulation. Outside of the lab, he has helped to design the logo for the USU team.
Rachel Porter is a sophomore at Utah State University majoring in Biological Engineering/pre-med. For the iGEM project, she helped to carry out some of the lab work. In the lab, she helped isolate and purify DNA, prepare and run electrophoresis gels, and culture cells.
Matthew Sims is a Senior attending Logan High School. This is his first year participating in laboratory research at Utah State University. He plans to go to college next fall and continue his studies in molecular biology and biochemistry. He helped during the summer months to carry out many experiments and obtain and analyze data.
Garrett Hinton is a junior at Sky View High School in Smithfield, Utah. He was heavily involved in the project discussion meetings, as well as the background literature research. Garrett spent many hours working on this project and carried out a substantial portion of the laboratory work.
We would like to thank our faculty advisers - Dr. Ron Sims, Dean Scott Hinton, and Dr. Charlie Miller - for all of their support and for providing this opportunity for the students.
Logan and USU

Team Conductance going crazy
iGEM 2008
The Brown iGEM Lab is student-run and consists of five undergraduates. This year, the team split up to work on two projects. We begin our training in the Spring semester with a lab class in Synthetic Biology.  With the gracious support of the UTRA Program and various departments, we work throughout the summer on our projects.  With the guidance of graduate mentors and faculty advisers across a multitude of departments, our lab is currently working on two such ventures--one a novel electrical reporting system and the other a novel threshold switch. In the spirit of Synthetic Biology, our team's project incorporates aspects of electrical engineering, electrochemistry, genetics, and microbiology.

About
Our Group
Our group has tens of students, of whom are freshmen, sophermore, junior and senior. And we are in different majors, some of us are from the school of chemical engineering and technology, some of us are from School of architecture, and some of us are from School of electronic and information engineering. The various backgrounds of us are really helpful in our brain storm held every couple of days. In the brain storms, we show our ideas come to us randomly, we discuss the value and the availibilty of the ideas and comes with more new ideas. Here I’d like to present some of our ideas and to get some advices from you.
What's the IGEMTJU stand for
Inspiration: Just like Newton’s apple and Archimedes’s bathroom , we need inspiration too.
Gain: No pain, no gain. We suffer from endless searching and reasoning, and we stand up time and time again after numerous failure and hits.
Experiment: Hypothesis is hypothesis forever. Through experiment, we endow it with life.
Modeling: Like experiment, modeling is also an effective and rapid way to give us the answer, especially simulating result of extreme situation.
Teamwork: We maybe ordinary people if we work separately, but we are outstanding when we get together in 08 iGEM Team.
Jellyfish: The origin of green fluorescent protein, always known as GFP,which is the commonly used signal in detecting the gene expression.
Universal: Since science has no border, we communicate with researchers worldwide.

Valencia iGEM'08 Team
Two leading groups form different areas have gathered together in this current iGEM competition.
Evolutionary genetics' group at Cavanilles Institute for Biodiversity and Evolutionary Biology from the Universidad de Valencia aims at studying biology at its furthermost frontier: from evolutuionary genetics of endosimbiotic bacteria to bioinformatics and theoretical biology, the group's interest spans many different biological areas. Leaded by Andres Moya, they already have an experience combining reasearch from genetics, biochemistry, evolutionary biology, molecular biology and informatics.
Intertech is a mixed scientific group form the Universidad Politécnica de Valencia and the Universidad de Valencia . Intertech is headed by three professors that have interests in Mathematics (Pedro Fernández de Córdoba), Engineering (Javier Urchueguía) and Photonics (Albert Ferrando). More interestingly, they have a common aim at finding scientific spaces where those three areas overlap, using 'interdisciplinarity' not just as a word, but as a proper scientific area.

The Davidson / Missouri Western synthetic biology team
Team Description
Our team is composed of undergraduates and faculty from Davidson College in Davidson, North Carolina and Missouri Western State University in Saint Joseph, Missouri as well as a student from Spelman College in Atlanta, Georgia and a student from Hampton University in Hampton, Virginia. This is the third year of iGEM collaboration for Davidson and Missouri Western, but the first year of participation for each of the fifteen students. In past years, the team has worked collaboratively at a distance, meeting for the first time at the iGEM competition in Boston.  This year, the team worked collaboratively from the two campuses for most of the summer but spent one week visiting each other's campuses, working shoulder-to-shoulder. The above picture was taken July 3, 2008 on the steps of the Chambers Building on the Davidson College campus.
E. nigma Project Overview
A recent article about cryptographic hash functions challenged the world to create a better hash function, an algorithm that produces a digital fingerprint of a digitized message.  We decided to work toward the design and construction of a bacterial hash function.  To this end, we designed and constructed several novel dually-regulated hybrid promoters, crucial new elements in the genetic circuitry we designed to function as biological XOR gates.  These gates produce a positive result in the presence of exactly one input and a negative result otherwise and can be put in sequence to create a bacterial hash function.  The name of the project is a play on the name of the World War II coding machine used to encrypt military secrets.

A combination of a student of biochemistry and a linguist, I am a fan of japanese language and culture. In the free time I don't spend in the lab, I usually watch anime, play FRP games or read fantasy books. In the future I see myself working as a researcher, possibly in Japan.

Since I like synthetic biology so much, I just couldn't resist accepting the invitation to be part of the Slovenian iGEM team again.
Apart from iGEMming I enjoy backpacking, painting, playing flute and lately also contemporary dancing.

Who we are
The University of Waterloo's 2008 iGEM Team is a dynamic group, consisting of students from the Faculties of Science, Engineering, and Mathematics. We are an undergraduate-run team, with a student Director managing most of our team's affairs and directing our team's ongoing activities. Our enthusiastic Faculty Instructors and Advisors give us the benefit of their experience and, in the case of Dr. Trevor Charles, lab space, and provide us with additional support and guidance in areas related to design, mathematical modelling, lab work and administration.
Because of Waterloo's co-op program, some of our members take courses during the summer, while others work full-time. The majority of our team members participate in the iGEM competition in their spare time, outside of work or school; a few have been involved part-time as part of their research-assistant positions in various labs in the UW Department of Biology. This team structure means that instead of each member taking on one aspect of the project to tackle over the course of the summer, our team collectively works on the project as a whole, each member picking up where the last left off the day before, or even earlier the same day!
UW iGEM Team members are all involved in a unique learning experience: our 2008 team consists largely of students who started with little or no research/laboratory experience and had a range of theoretical knowledge of molecular biology.  With a desire to learn and guidance from more experienced teammates, these students have become comfortable working in a lab environment, and our senior members have had valuable opportunities to share their experience with others.

Sibat Khwaja
I am a third year Biomedical Science student of the Faculty of Medicine at the University of Calgary. My background is in biology, genetics, bio and organic chemistry with a focus in Biomedical Research. My work in iGEM this summer has been a meaningful experience and involved learning  a lot more about what synthetic biology has to offer in medicine, environment, food and technology. As a Biomedical science student, I spend most of my time doing experiments in the lab and analyzing what went wrong and iGEM ethics added a very different touch to my academic background. I was inspired to join this group after taking a course in ethical issues in medical research and practice, where I learned about the vital role ethics plays from the very initiation of the planning/designing of these synthetic biological systems.   Besides school, I love spending time with my family, listen to music, play my guitar, spend time with my friends and volunteer.
I am very excited about going to MIT and present our findings!!!
Niklas Bobrovitz
Niklas Bobrovitz
I am entering my 2nd year as a Health and Society major in the Bachelor of Health Sciences program at the University of Calgary. I have a passion for biology and an uninhibited interest in the operation and evolution of society.I joined the iGEM team for 2008 because I believe synthetic biology will drive many major social changes in the future, both locally and globally. The advancements that synthetic biology may offer, especially in medicine and environmental safety, have many ethical, social, legal and economic implications. I want to examine these issues and gain a better understanding of them as they must be considered before any innovation from the field of synthetic biology can be implemented in society.

Daniela Navia
I am in my second year at the University of Calgary as a Health and Society major. I joined iGem because I am a science fiction enthusiast and the idea of creating life from scratch immediately triggered my preconceived ideas of mad scientists and dystopia. While my perspectives on Synthetic biology have broadened and I am convinced of the positive effect this approach may have, I am sure many individuals across the globe share my previous ideas on biotechnology. Participating in the iGEM ethics project has given me a wealth of knowledge about a field I was practically unaware of and inspired me to share what I have learned and engage in active discussions with individuals that may be unaware of the direction of the field and the impact it could have on society and the environment.

Prof. Dr. Roland Eils
Prof. Dr. Roland Eils
Thanks to Professor Eils, since he will sponsor travel/participation stipends for all undergraduate students on the team to attend the final jamboree at MIT. He will also provide R&D facilities and a team budget. Professor Eils is head of the Departments of Theoretical Bioinformatics in the institutes Bioquant, IPMB, and DKFZ. Moreover, he is founding director of Bioquant and directs the German-wide Systems Biology in Cancer initiative of the Helmholtz foundation with a volume of 50 Mio. Euro. Together with Professor Wolfrum he directs the Viroquant initiative on modeling and simulation of virus entry. He has won numerous awards in the field of image analysis; in particular he has been awarded the Biofuture price by the BMBF for innovations allowing the graphical reconstruction of the eukaryotic mitosis process from 4D microscopy images. In 2004, he was one of the organizers of the International Conference on Systems Biology, which was hosted by him here in Heidelberg. His publication with Martin Bentele, Inna Lavrik and Professor Krammer on the computational determination of the CD95 threshold in The Journal of Cell Biology in 2004 gave birth to the current Applied Systems Biology group, which is now largely involved in the research of cancer signaling. In 2004, Professor Eils, Ivayla Vacheva, and Professor Bock have won the Microsoft Research Award for the development of Optimal Experiment Design tools. His new engagement in the up-coming field of synthetic biology underlines the need for tight interdisciplinary work between experimentalists and theoreticians. back

Dr. Victor Sourjik
Dr. Victor Sourjik
Victor Sourjik has studied Molecular Biology and Physics at University of Regensburg. He has done his PhD at the Institute of Physics and Technology in Moskow and in the lab of Professor R. Schmitt at University of Regensberg. He then went as post-doctoral scientist for five years to Professor H. Berg at Harvard University in Cambridge, USA, and became group leader in 2003 at the Center for Molecular Biology in Heidelberg. Victor investigates bacterial chemotaxis as example for the molecular perception of environmental signals and their transduction within cells. He combines quantitative data with computational modeling to obtain a detailed understanding of the signaling mechanisms in complex systems. In his Nature publication in 2005 he could use criteria for systems robustness in order to predict a correct topology for the Che signal transduction network. This approach has become a paradigm for the utilization of systems biology to pursue biological research. For his successful research on prokaryotic signal transduction Victor has won the Chica and Heinz Schaller award in 2007. We are sure that his broad experience in the field of bacterial chemotaxis will be a key asset to the strength of our team. back

Jens Keienburg
Jens Keienburg
Jens is a Ph. D. student in the Applied Systems Biology group of Professor Eils at Bioquant. With Hauke, Victor and Professor Eils he initiated the iGEM team for Heidelberg and will coordinate the project over the summer. He has studied Molecular Biotechnology at University of Heidelberg with a focus on Systems Biology. As part of his studies he visited in 2005/06 for seven months the Systems Biology Group of Professor Palsson at UCSD in California, where he tested novel FBA methods to predict the metabolic state of bacteria. For his Master thesis he has worked in the Applied Systems Biology group of Professor Eils on a negative feedback loop to analyze the dynamics of transient states in prokaryotic gene expression. Though this project is on-going, his main interest is the application of Optimal Experimental Design tools for the parameter estimation of large ODE sets to model complex biological systems. As mentor with experience in theoretical and experimental tracks, he will encourage students for research across conventional discipline boundaries. back

Dr. Hauke Busch
Dr. Hauke Busch
Hauke is group leader within the Applied Systems Biology group of Professor Eils at Bioquant. Due to his firm background in systems theory he is an enthusiastic fan of synthetic biology and iGEM; it is for his persevering encouragements that an iGEM team for Heidelberg could be initiated. Hauke has done his Ph. D. in non-linear dynamics at the Technical University of Darmstadt. At the DKFZ in Heidelberg he has been involved in the start-up of today's Applied Systems Biology group. He currently works on several interdisciplinary projects at Bioquant and DKFZ. His findings on the orchestration of multiple signaling pathways controlling keratinocyte migration have recently been accepted by Molecular Systems Biology. Inspired by his background in stochastic modeling he furthermore investigates transient gene expression states that are affected by random reaction kinetics due to low particle numbers, in particular in prokaryotes. He is also involved in the development of optimal experiment design tools for the parameter estimation in large ODE systems. With Jens and Victor he will coordinate and support the team during the summer. His experience with experimental biologists will help the team to find exciting connections between wet-lab biology and systems biology. back

Dr. Barbara DiVentura
Dr. Barbara DiVentura
Computer engineer by university training (carried out in the University of Rome “La Sapienza”), Barbara has done her Ph.D. in molecular biology in the laboratory of Luis Serrano, at the EMBL in Heidelberg. Her Ph.D. project consisted in constructing a synthetic human p53 network in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The absence in yeast of the vast majority of p53 regulators allowed investigating its functional, post-translational modifications by Mdm2. She found that Mdm2 is necessary in yeast to recruit p53 to nuclear bodies reminiscent of human PML bodies, suggesting a possible involvement of Mdm2 in the recruitment of p53 to PML bodies in human cells. This reductionist yeast model paves the way to dissecting the p53 network to understand the core mechanisms of its regulation. On the theoretical side Barbara has worked on modeling biochemical networks in a spatial stochastic framework. She believes in the power of synthetic biology to teach important lessons about real biological systems as well as in the winning combination of theory and experiments to understand the molecular mechanisms driving biological processes. Barbara is very excited at the idea of mentoring the young, motivated and enthusiastic students of the Heidelberg iGEM 2008 team! back

Philipp Bayer
Philipp Bayer
Philipp is a student of biology in the 1st semester at the University of Heidelberg. Although it will be his first semester at the university iGEM is not his first experience in a lab. Philipp has been a member of the Heidelberger Life-Science Lab (HLSL) for several years where he gained experience in lab work while doing practical work in labs at the DKFZ and the EMBL in Heidelberg and by completing an four week internship at the University of Stanford, California where he did research on gene therapy with adeno associated viruses and RNAi. Philipp enjoys the interdisciplinarity of the iGEM project, especially the uncommon insights in system biology and mathematical simulations. Since Philipp is still an active mentor of the HLSL where he teaches high school kids in sciences he’s interested in methods of successful science communication.
Philipp is proud to have the chance of joining well experienced students and their advisors in the competition for the Grand Prize - but he is sure to win in any case, in many ways.

So, after you have got to know the team a little better, we will proceed to have a look at the project of our team ... follow Phips (step 2)
[ ...back to step 1 ]
There are many universities - and there is Heidelberg ...
Dating back to 1386 the Ruperto-Carola University of Heidelberg [1] is not only Germany's oldest university [2, 3], but - associated with numerous Nobel Laureates [4] - it is also one of Europe's prestigious places for natural, life and medical sciences [5]. For students, however, Heidelberg is not only the starting ground for a scientific career, it also hosts a fountain for inter-cultural relations and friendships [6].

Bioquant - a short name for a large network
Bioquant - the abbreviation for Institute of Quantitative Analysis of Molecular and Biological Systems - pursues a rather different foundational concept: to supplement a core of researchers the building provides a working platform, which is accessed by external research groups. Existing expertises in mathematical theory and experimental biology merge in this way to new synergies for research in systems biology - and since this summer also in synthetic biology!
Left you can get an impression of where we work. You could find us in the front building at the far left end of the picture... The building is situated on the campus of the university of Heidelberg.

DKFZ - how to win the Nobel Prize in 25 years
The German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ) [1] has just recently been rated by an international panel as one of the leading cancer research institutes - confirmed simultaneously by the award with the Medicine Nobel Prize to Professor zur Hausen, who discovered the Papilloma virus as agent for cervical cancer in 1983. At this time zur Hausen took charge of the DKFZ for the succeeding two decades and lead the institute to its modern approach to Molecular Biology. The Helmholtz-Association - to which the DKFZ belongs - initiated one of the largest programs for systems biology in cancer, which is coordinated from Heidelberg.

BioRegio Rhein-Neckar - connecting science and industry
The Rhein-Neckar area - which reaches from Mannheim to Heidelberg (west-east) and from Darmstadt to Karlsruhe (north-south) has witnessed an enormous increase in biotechnological activities over the last decade. This development has been acknowledged several times by the German Ministry for Education and Research (BMBF, read Newspaper Articles in German), which lead to the name of the BioRegio Rhein-Neckar [1]. On the academic side the Technical Universities of Karlsruhe and Darmstadt, the Business schools at University of Mannheim, and the life science based University of Heidelberg form a geographical rhombus that delivers all competences for sustainable growth. Industrial heavy-weights in chemistry (BASF AG in Mannheim), pharmacy (Merck AG in Darmstadt), and software development (SAP AG in Walldorf) strengthen the region in its challenging ambitions. The creation of the technology park in Heidelberg allows start-up companies in biotechnology to tightly cooperate with the neighboring university, the DKFZ and the European Laboratory of Molecular Biology (EMBL). In the left image you can see the ZMBH and the Bioquant building on the main campus and the technology park in the background.

The EvoGents
Neven Dimic
I am a second year chemical engineering student, with a specialization in energy and the environment.   Although I have not studied biology since high school, I was immediately intrigued when I heard about iGEM.  This competition allows us to apply  engineering principles to biology.   I had an amazing summer contributing to the emerging discipline of synthetic biology, a discipline which will definitely shape the future.
Outside of school, I have many interests.  I devote my time to friends and family, sports, volunteering, traveling, movies, music,  life...
Taras Karpachevskyy
I'm now in my second year studying mechanical / biomedical engineering. iGEM was a chance for me to do and learn something a little bit different from the ordinary class material, and that was fantastic. I see a lot of potential in synthetic biology, though not in the sense that it's a revolutionary new way of doing everything. I look at it more as a tried and true approach that has proven itself over a very long time, and that will help humans immensely once we learn how to use it properly. From a long-term perspective, with synthetic biology, it won't matter as much whether there is oil to burn or to turn into plastic. As long as the sun is shining and you have dirt under your feet, you'll be able speak the language of nature and create the things you need to live.
Joshua Leung
I am a 2nd year Chemical Engineering student with a Biomedical specialization. Though my major skills academically are involved in chemistry and mathematics, I have an interest in biology. In fact, after my engineering degree, I am considering to go into medicine. As a result, iGEM was of great interest to me as it gave me a good opportunity for me to explore the world of biology and the future of synthetic biology. It is my hope that I can be a part of this emerging technology that will change the world.
My interests outside of school include sports, especially basketball and hockey, books, and video games. Sports is a big thing in my life. Whether it is playing the sport, or watching the sport, I am very competitive and enjoy the thrill of the game. The Calgary Flames are my team all the way!
Boris Shabash
4th year Bio-Informatics student at the University of Calgary and loving every second of it!
My participation in iGEM is motivated by the fact I see iGEM as the beginning of something much, much bigger. Synthetic biology is going to become the new motivating force for pharmaceutical research, medical practice, biochemical engineering and many more applications we can't even probably imagine.
With the advancements of synthetic biology, systems biology and the bio-informatics world will be a new field with a brand new perspective on the computational science and natural science nexus. As essential as computer aid is in engineering and the medical fields, it will also become a fundamental component in synthetic biology.
I plan to be one of the people at the centre of this computational revolution. The power that new programming paradigms (e.g Genetic Programming and Evolutionary Strategies) can offer to synthetic biology is something that I consider needs to be harnessed at this point, at this day and age, and I'm here to aid in that reframe.
Most of the time I spend outside of writing code and studying I dedicate to latin dancing, martial arts and friends. Exercising your brain is pretty important, but exercising your body is even more important. And social dancing and martial arts are both awesome.
Kent Thachek
I am a 3rd year bioinformatics student in the Faculty of Medicine, Bachelor of Health Sciences Honors program.  My primary interests span from computational algorithms to genome annotation, as well as biochemistry.  The application of computer science in biology is a truly astounding study to me.  It is my intention to gain a broad range of generic skills, applicable to many different aspects of biology.
My involvement with the University of Calgary iGEM Software Team began this year and I assisted with the analysis, design, and programming in the EvoGEM project.  I had background experience in programming and was just introduced to many of the modern heuristic strategies over the summer, namely Evolutionary Strategies and Agent-Based modeling.  This project was intuitive and interesting, so I was naturally enthused about aiding in its development.  I hope to continue in such endeavors.
The Supervisors
Dr. Christian Jacob
Dr. Jacob received his Ph.D.  in Computer Science from the University   of Erlangen-Nuremberg, Germany. In July 1999, Dr. Jacob joined the   Department of Computer Science (Faculty of Science) at the University   of Calgary. Since August 2003, he also holds a joint appointment with   the Department of Biochemistry & Molecular Biology (Faculty of   Medicine), where he is the Director of Bioinformatics in the Bachelor   of Health Sciences Program.
Dr. Jacob leads the Evolutionary & Swarm Design (E&SD) research group   of the Artificial Intelligence Laboratory and is currently   establishing a Unit for Computational Modeling, Experimental Design & Analysis within the Faculty of Medicine.
Dr. Jacob and his research group are investigating how to apply   evolutionary, swarm and collective intelligence techniques in various   application domains. So far, the E&SD research group has built   mathematical models, computer simulations and visualizations of   traffic systems, army ants, neuron growth, biomolecular systems, and   gene regulatory systems. Some of the projects are described in detail   at the ESD website: http://www.swarm-design.org .
Dr. Jacob has written two books on evolutionary computing and natural   programming paradigms: Principia Evolvica (dpunkt, Heidelberg, 1997;   in German) and Illustrating Evolutionary Computation with Mathematica   (Morgan Kaufmann, San Francisco, 2001).
This is the third year that Dr. Jacob is an iGEM  supervisor at the University of Calgary.
Dr. Anders Nygren
I am an Assistant Professor in the Centre for Bioengienering Research & Education and the Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering at the University of Calgary. This is the first summer I have been involved in iGEM and I think it is fair to say that I have learned more from the process than anyone has learned from me! I am already looking forward to next year, hoping that we can get more Biomedical Engineering students involved in iGEM at the U of C. The Biomedical Engineering Program here is only a few years old, but we already have a great momentum going with lots of great students.
Outside work? What else would you do around Calgary than spend time in the Rockies hiking, skiing, paddling, cycling, and just enjoying life?

Where we're from
Lausanne is a beautiful city near the Leman Lake and the Alps, in Switzerland. Our school is one of the two engineering schools on the federal level in Switzerland, sister school of ETH in Zürich. We are from the Life Sciences department, and most of us study in the Life Sciences and Technology section. We enjoy a beautiful campus near the lake, with infrastructures in many engineering departments, which we take advantage of for many multidisciplinary projects and approaches.
Life Sciences and Technologies at EPFL
In the last few years, the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology of Lausanne has been developing a new bachelor and master curriculum built at the interface between engineering and life sciences. The Life Sciences and Technologies curriculum gives us an interdisciplinary approach to life sciences current issues.
During the bachelor cycle, we study above all mathematics, physics, chemistry and informatics while going through the basics in diverse biological and engineering subjects. During the master cycle, we can then specialize our studies into diverse fields such as neuroscience, oncology, biotechnology, bioengineering, or bioinformatics.

Our iGem Experience
IGEM has permitted us to have an incomparable insight into what Genetic Engineering really is about. Since we all come from a Life Science curriculum, this competition allowed us to apply all we have already studied and more. It was a test to see how our knowledge and skills so far would allow us to achieve a research project from A to Z (idea drafting to application stages). The experience couldn't be better. During six short exciting months, we learned how biological research takes time, patience and dedication. We don't think any other project at least open to Bachelor students could have taught us so much in so little time, all this, while meeting new people and having fun! We were initiated to real lab work, which for many of us was completely new. We learned more simulations methods and how to apply concrete mechanical engineering applied to biological application (microfluidics). We all personally gained invaluable new skills and experience by participating in EPF-Lausanne's IGEM team. Not only did we gain more drive too pursue our studies but we also acquired much new and interesting knowledge.
We all look forward to being in Boston and meeting the other teams!

The Groningen Transformers
Somewhere in the north of the Netherlands, the Groningen Transformers are busy working on their brilliant plans. Here in the lab, our mascot “Edje”, a plush giant E. coli microbe, is keeping an eye on our daily work in the labs and keeps us from throwing our computers out the window whenever Matlab and Clone Manager are giving us a hard time. At the end of the days, we like to play little sports tournaments or go to the movies, good and REALLY bad movies. After all, our iGEM summer project will be enjoyable :).

Enjoy the sun!

University of Groningen
The University of Groningen has a long academic tradition extending back to 1614, which makes Groningen the oldest university in the Netherlands after Leiden. The founding of the university – at that time still a college of higher education – was an initiative taken by the Regional Assembly of the city of Groningen and the Ommelanden (surrounding region). There were four faculties – Theology, Law, Medicine and Philosophy. The first 75 years of its existence were very fruitful for the university with about 100 students enrolling every year. In 1815, at the same time as Leiden and Utrecht, the university gained recognition as a national college of higher education, but this was followed by discussions about closure. The situation improved markedly when a new main university building 'the Academiegebouw' (see picture on home-page) was constructed in 1850, a building that was largely financed by the people of Groningen. This made the fire that completely destroyed this building in 1906 even more poignant. When the university celebrated its first 300 years in 1914 there were 611 registered students; this had already grown to 1000 by 1924. After a drop back during the Depression, and in particular during the Second World War, the number of students grew rapidly from 1945 to reach 20,000 in 1994. At the present time there are about 21,000 students registered at the University of Groningen with the number of foreign students again growing steadily.
Where we're from
Groningen is a town in the north of the Netherlands.
Funding of the team 2008
For the 2008 team of the groningen university funds where acquired from Gratama foundation , Biotechnology fund Netherlands (SBN, Stichting biotechnologie nederland), Centre for synthetic biology groningen , Groningen Biomolecular Sciences and Biotechnology Institute , Zernike institute for advanced materials , Stratingh institute for Chemistry and the commercial company DSM .

Team Introduction
Founded in the  winter of 2007, Hong Kong, the iHKU team has  been enjoying its adventure in the world of synthetic biology in the past 10  months. Though we iHKU members come together with different backgrounds, it  never becomes a problem for us to concentrate and contribute to our project.  Instead, we overcame uncountable difficulties we have encountered with the help  of our knowledge from different fields. As we know that the only way to build a  successful synthetic biology project is to try it out, great effort has been  made to serve the very purpose. With great passion and creativity, we are  confident to deliver the most brilliant project this year.

Team Introduction
Founded in the  winter of 2007, Hong Kong, the iHKU team has  been enjoying its adventure in the world of synthetic biology in the past 10  months. Though we iHKU members come together with different backgrounds, it  never becomes a problem for us to concentrate and contribute to our project.  Instead, we overcame uncountable difficulties we have encountered with the help  of our knowledge from different fields. As we know that the only way to build a  successful synthetic biology project is to try it out, great effort has been  made to serve the very purpose. With great passion and creativity, we are  confident to deliver the most brilliant project this year.

Team Wisconsin is a diverse team consisting of upper and lower class undergraduates who are working together to do something seriously cool: renewable biofuels.  With backgrounds varying from Mechanical Engineering to Biochemistry, our varied team is exploring new ways to solve old problems using synthetic biology.
We also (generally) love late night romantic trips to movies, long walks, scheming up ways to become wealthy, discussing interesting social interactions, knitting, and having fun... Obviously.

I really take the iGEM competition an exciting event and I am happy to participate in it and design all these devices and detailed experiments. The experiments have made me more familiar with the molecular methods. This competition has also given me the chance to know more about the frontiers of synthetic biology.

Hi, guys. It is quite a great opportunity for me to acquaint you in this iGEM. It not only offers me a chance to treat my skill in the experiment, but also I can make my creative and even crazy idea be feasible. Best wishes for the Jamboree. Best wishes for my friends. I am dying to make friends with you guys, genius.

Strasbourg iGEM-Gang
Our team consists of seven students coming from different scientific backgrounds prior to the ESBS. This will help us to deal with the difficulties coming up during this interdisciplinary project. Our shared education at the ESBS however enables us to communicate more easily with each other. All team members are in the final year of their master's degree (diplôme ingénieur) and therefore still fulfill the premise of undergrads after iGEM definition.
We first heard of iGEM through a lecture given by Randy Rettberg at the IGBMC, just next door to the ESBS. He encouraged us to build up a team and recruit supervisors that will be helpful for specific questions depending on the chosen project. As a student-run team, we must handle all portions of our project ourselves, but nevertheless we get a lot of support from many institutes at the ESBS, in the “Upper-Rhine region” and elsewhere.

The University of Guelph is a mid sized, comprehensive University that is generally regarded as Canada's agricultural university and outstanding in the field of life sciences. Our university motto is actually, ""Changing lives, improving life.""    Add the words, ""using synthetic biology"" to that motto and you've got a university which was made to participate in iGEM.
This is our first year in the event, and we hope that it will take root here, becoming a creative outlet for competitive students to prime themselves for jobs and careers in research and development to sustainably and profoundly help the world's biological science tackle problems of food, medicine, and material production that we face.
Initial funding for the team was provided for us by the Gordon Nixon Leadership Award, which was won by our iGEM superman Dave earlier this year. Subsequent partnerships and sponsors have given us products to work with (NEB and IDT), an operating budget (Departments of Plant Agriculture, Graduate Student Association, and Molecular Cellular Biology), and lab equipment and space (Dr. Manish Raizada). It has been hard to organize and bushwhack through a totally new realm, but we hope next year we'll get funding for paid positions and University recognized course credit to help ensure this adventure in synthetic biology will continue and benefit future groups of grad students and undergrads.
Who we are
Advisors
Dave The RAVE Johnston
Dr. Manish N. Raizada
Dave The RAVE Johnston:     This man has travelled the world and has brought back the proud chewing gum of different nations to prove it-- he's a calm and collected PhD student in plant agriculture; he aspires to feed hungry bodies with food and hungry brains with delicious science; his idealistic vision transforms us like a broad host range plasmid.
Dr. Manish N. Raizada:      Our technical advisor and representative; Dr. Raizada has kindly donated his lab and legal know-how to keep our projects running.
Operation SynthOp (Synthetic Operon Subproject)
Brendan Hussey
Lisa Ledger
Tin Vo
Brendan Hussey:    Our very own renaissance man; athletic and dedicated to science, he is presently balancing as many as three genetics projects simultaneously and still has time to concatenate primers together; he can explain the most convoluted of concepts with little more than a diagram and ten words.
Lisa Ledger:    An interdisciplined being; she is equally well tuned in the lab, as well as in bioinformatics; this quick-witted well-rounded scientist can cure what ails your plasmid.
Tin Vo:    A deeply reflective individual-- silent in his contemplation; precise in his execution-- He is our laboratory ninja.
The Interference Brigade (RNAi Subproject)
Jennifer Jennivo Vo
Mufaddal Moff Man Girnary
Jennifer Jennivo Vo:    She is dedicated and quick learning; with her pleasant disposition, she can coax a bacterial culture into growing with just her smile.
Mufaddal Moff Man Girnary:    He is well-read and well-rounded; this gentleman adds a layer of intrigue and unpredictable insight to the team.
Nerve Endings (Legal, Business and Gophers)
Eddie LOUD Ma
Eddie LOUD Ma:    The team gopher-- forging connections with professors and chairs, keeping the minutes and doing the occasional transformation; thankfully, hunting season is closed.
Thanks to Our Contributors and Collaborators
Dr. Emma Allen-Vercoe
Dr. Deborah Stacey
iGEM Minnesota Team TimeBomb
iGEM Calgary Ethics
iGEM Edinburgh
Dr. Rene Van Acker
Dr. Chris Whitfield
New England Biolabs
Integrated DNA Technologies
Dr. Emma Allen-Vercoe:    A major support for the synthetic operon project, Dr. Allen-Vercoe provided us with leadership, perspective, anaerobic growth chambers, growth media, our E. coli Nissle 1917 strain, several strains of lactobaciilli (which we never got a chance to electroporate successfully), and both our gram positive plasmids pRV566 and pRV85. Wow, without her, most of the potential in this work could not have been realized!
Dr. Deborah Stacey:   Dr. Stacey provided us the opportunity to use SharkNet, a network of computers which together make a powerful supercomputer. With no obvious use for this in our wetlab oriented project, we had to pass and hope her offer to make iGEM part of the Bioinformatics department's curriculum will bear fruit in the coming months.
iGEM Minnesota Team Time Bomb:    With previous experience in carotenoid genetics they were very fast and supportive in sending us some genes so we could stand on their shoulders (they are giants)!
iGEM Calgary Ethics: Is the wetlab stuff we're doing a relevant and sustainable for the problems we percieve? Where and underwhat conditions might it actually help? (assuming we can actually make it) Calgary Ethics have conducted an ethics and economics study for us to provide the necessary information and tools to help answer these questions. It is posted here : https://2008.igem.org/Team:Calgary_Ethics/Collaboration
iGEM Edinburgh: Also having worked on carotenoids in the past, Edinborough was great in sharing carotenoid metabolic genes, flux modulators, and gram positive plasmids with us. With collaborators like these, globalization doesn't seem like such a bad thing after all.
Dr. Chris Whitfield: Most of us hail from the department of Molecular and Cellular Biology, so it was very significant to have the chair of that department on board. Dr. Whitfield gave us a hefty sequencing and lab supply budget and will likely indirectly influence generations of future iGEMers to make iGEM Guelph their own.
Dr. Rene Van-Acker: Every artist needs a muse. Dr. Van Acker lent the team early inspiration and motivation when we had no funding yet, and encouraged us with greenhouse space and transportation to the jamboree! We better take some good photos for him to live vicariously through us!
New England Biolabs: When we needed taq, NEB came to the rescue. When we needed proofreading Phusion taq, NEB was there. Nucleotides, restriction enzymes, buffers, and new lab strains of E. coli: thank you so much, it warms our heart to have been supported by such a well respected and forward thinking company.
Integrated DNA Technologies: These guys were great about sponsoring us for the many primers and gene constructs we used. Of special note and thanks, was the credit they gave us towards the Ultramer we used in production of our 250 bp RNAi construct - can't imagine what cloning that peice by peice would've been like.

What we did
The larger version of System #2 workflow can be seen under The Project .
Thane contributed enormously to System #2, envisioning how the system would be set up, reading a humongous amount of background material, and spending countless hours in the lab. He also made the workflow for System #2!
Kevin worked on System #1 for the summer. Although there were many setbacks (for what seemed) a simple setup, results were finally generated. Also put together the wiki.
Dave provided help setting up System #2 and his experience was invaluable in the weeks leading up to the iGEM Jamboree for finishing touches in areas of the project. His ideas also gave rise to the project at the beginning of the summer.
Kingsley worked with our two mutants of LuxO. He also helped elsewhere in the lab.

Ariel Lindner, Biology / Chemistry
Major in Chemistry (Hebrew University, Jerusalem), M.Sc. and Ph.D. from the Weizmann Institute of Science (Rehovot, Israel) working on catalytic antibodies as enzyme models. After a research period at the Scripps Institute (California, USA), I currently work in Paris as associate professor at the Medicine faculty of medicine, Paris Descartes university where where applpying Physical, Chemical and Biological approaches to study variability between clonal individual bacterial cells and their aging. As a co-initiator and teacher of the Interdisciplinary Approaches to Life Sciences master program at the Center for Research and Interdisciplinarity, I try to help students fulfill their talents and thus instruct our students-initiated iGEM team.
Samuel Bottani, Physics
I am a physicist, associate professor at the University Denis Diderot in Paris. I am interested in self-organization, out of equilibrium dynamics, and the logic of cellular computation. My research interests are on structure, dynamics and evolution of regulatory networks. In particular I am interested in the interplay between genome architecture, spatial organization of the cell and dynamical properties of cell functions. Genomic context and architecture possibly determines or optimizes the output of artificial genetic networks. I am very concerned in innovation in university teaching.
Gregory Batt, Computer Science
I'm a research scientist at INRIA.  I work on developing mathematical approaches and computational tools for the analysis of genetic regulatory networks, with applications in systems and synthetic biology. The central question I try to address is how to obtain relevant predictions despite large parameter uncertainties and environmental fluctuations. My work combines modeling in biology, maths and computer science.

Where and when iGEM08 Paris took place ?
The Center for Research and Interdisciplinarity (CRI) is a structure hosted in the medicine faculty of the university Paris Descartes located at the Cochin-Port Royal site. It proposes to students and researchers from different backgrounds to create multidisciplinary projects. Synthetic biology is a promising subject for the development of such projects as it tries to put into practice the concepts of engineering into biology.
The CRI is a structure in the heart of which students animate scientific clubs, where they meet to read scientific articles, share ideas and receive guests. The club SYNBIOSYS for Synthetic and Systems Biology was created in November 2006. This initiative was truly a hit, and, quite understandably, the students heard about iGEM and decided to participate in 2007 , supported by several teachers and scientists.
Thanks to its original project of Multicellular Synthetic Bacteria, able to optimize the production of a useful substance for men, the Parisian iGEM team managed to reach the Finale where the students won a Gold Medal as well as the prestigious Grand Prize for Foundational Research. Quite understandably, the SYNBIOSYS club created another iGEM team for the 2008 edition.
Who we are ?
Our team in the lab'
Our team is supervised by five Instructors who have diametrically opposite backgrounds, chemistry, biology, physics and computational biology. Besides, six Advisors help us when we have a problem. We are fourteen Students participating this year to the iGEM competition. We are coming from different universities and ""Grandes Ecoles"". Five of us are working in the dry lab, we are nine in the wet lab and Romain, thanks to his background in engineering in life sciences is at the interface. Exclusively, this year, our team is hosting one high school student participating to the Science Academie program: Guillaume.

Introduction
ENGINEERING COLICIN E7 PRODUCTION SYSTEM TO KILL ENTEROHEMORRHAGIC ESCHERICHIA COLI O157:H7 (EHEC) VIA THE DETECTION OF EHEC SYMPTOMS
The focus of the NTU @ iGEM Team's project is the use of bacteriocins (i.e. colicin E7) for the killing of the Escherichia Coli O157:H7 enterohemorrhagic strain (EHEC), which causes symptoms such as bloody diarrhea. Currently, there are no antibiotics that can cure EHEC. This is a prevalent medical problem that has a reach of a wide population. The team intends to achieve its objective by engineering a biological system that:
i) produces Colicin E7,
ii) detects the symptoms (e.g. blood) and presence of pathogenic E-Coli, and
iii) releases E7 through lysis.
The system will be developed using  the following proposed protocol: Colicin E7 production is achieved by the insertion of the colicin E7 gene and colicin immunity gene downstream of and under regulation of the LacI gene, found in wild type E. Coli K12 strain. The production of the lysis protein functions under the control of an AND gate, constructed by two plasmids, and whose inputs are presence of Fe2+ ions  (attributed to presence of blood) and Ai2 (attributed to presence of O157:H7).
LuxS knock-out was carried out to eliminate Ai2 production of K12, obtaining mutant W3110 strain, thus ensuring that Ai2 detected is purely from O157:H7. Upon detection of Fe2+ ions, T7ptag expression is initiated producing T7 RNA Polymerase. Upon detection of phosphorylated Ai2, expression of the SupD gene is initiated by activation of promoter LsrA, producing amber suppressor tRNA. In combination, the two upstream inputs activate the expression of the lysis protein gene, under the influence of R6K origin, resulting in amplified response of the AND gate.
The team also intends to characterize the various parts and devices used in the project, in terms of sensitivity to temperature and input concentrations by fluorescence assay and Western blotting. The team will also present the modeling of the final system.
The team employed the methodology used on basic engineering concepts: Abstraction, decoupling and standardization.
Abstraction
In abstraction, the complexity of things was reduced by creating simple parts and developing these parts into higher complex devices and systems
Decoupling
In decoupling, each individual part was decoupled from the others, devising them without consideration for the other existing part. Following which the fusion of different combination of components formed a working device
Standardization
In standardization, the team aims to establish standards that are widely used and agreed. The team also allowed the predicament of components and compatibility of parts leading to a set of standards and protocols that could be used for future teams.

Competences
Bastiaan
As a bioinformatics student I have experience with:
Computational biology
Writing software
All the computer nerd stuff: wiki, registration of standard biological parts, ...
Mathematical modeling - not a core competence, but I have some experience with it.
Searching for information in online biological databases (e.g. searching for genes, searching for metabolic pathways with certain functions)
Oscar
My experience in working with cells will be the main contribution probably during this project. I've some knowledge of bioinformatics (BLAST etc. and molecular imaging software). I think that the following competences could be handy within our project
General Lab experience
Knowledge on molecular biology
Well trained pipetting thumb :-)
A little bit of bioinformatics, but that's probably best left to Bastiaan.
Ruud
My contributions and competences are comparable to Oscar's. General lab practice experience from practicals and two interns and some experience in bioinformatics from several courses. My competences:
General lab experience in molecular biology
Experience in team-work from projects and interns
Know-how in the field of molecular biology
Also my thumb is up to the task of pipetting
Some knowledge on bioinformatics
Steven
I have general experience in the laboratory practises, but my contributions to the project will hopefully also be in the fields of ethics in biotechnology. The personal competences that might prove useful in our iGEM project:
General lab experiences
Team project experiences
Ethics in industrial biotechnology
One strong thumb that may prove to be useful for a number of tasks...

Team:ETH Zurich/Team/Overview
From 2008.igem.org
How the Team Met
Part of the team learned about iGEM during the Synthetic Biology Lecture given by our faculty at ETHZ. Another part of the team applied after receiving the following ETHZ-wide e-mail promoting iGEM:
What is the most exciting thing natural scientists and engineers can do together? - The iGEM summer competition!
iGEM is an international student competition in the field of synthetic biology, organized by MIT. Each participating university sets up an interdisciplinary student team consisting of 8 to 10 biologists, chemists and engineers.
Half of the team has to be composed of undergraduate students, but also MSc and PhD students can participate.
The team's goal is to collect ideas on a novel biological system, analyze the biological and engineering design alternatives, including mathematical modeling of the system, and to choose the 'best' design.
This system is then translated into DNA code and tested experimentally in vivo.
In November 2008, all teams shall present their projects at the MIT in Boston. Back in 2007, there were 57 teams participating from all over the world, including teams from MIT, UCSF, Caltech, Duke, Stanford, TIT, Princeton, Cambridge, Imperial, Harvard, UC Berkeley, and more teams from the US, Australia, India, China, Japan, and Europe ( https://2007.igem.org/Main_Page ).
After major successes in 2005 (best engineering), 2006 (best device) and 2007 (best presentation), ETH is participating again this year, and professors Sven Panke and Jörg Stelling are assembling a mixed team of engineers and natural scientists from the Bachelor, Master and PhD level. If you want to be part of the iGEM experience, apply until April 11th.
Nine students got selected for this year's team, and on Wednesday, April 16th, the first meeting was scheduled.
As you can see on our Team Members Page , students from very diverse fields were offered the possibility to participate in the ETH iGEM team.
Boot Camp
The following weeks were what last year's team had referred to as ""Boot Camp"". Our advisers organized two weeks of an intense crash course into the field of synthetic biology, during which, on the basis of paper discussions, we learned about the diverse aspects of the field:

LABCOURSE at CNB
Basic hands-on modelling
Lab Course
Additionally, one week of lab crash course was integrated into the ""Boot Camp"" in the beginning of June. The aim of this course was to introduce non-biologists to basic techniques of micro- and molecular biology. That way, the non-biologists were able to assist the biologists, so that the ""experts"" could concentrate more on experimental planning and on the interpretation of results. The idea was to grasp this chance of an interdisciplinary project and offer the students the possibility to get an insight into a field that differs significantly from their own. Therefore, the modelers became comfortable in the lab, and the biologists learned something about modeling.

Team:Bay Area RSI/Team
From 2008.igem.org
Every year over 1.2 million people suffer myocardial infarction (MI). The resulting heart damage requires new approaches for effective repair. Stem cell therapies provide hope. However none of the stem cell therapies currently in clinical trials addresses the need for efficient stem cell targeting to cardiac tissue or the need to replace efficiently dead tissue with new cardiomyocytes. To address these problems, we have built several genetic circuits that work sequentially to repair the heart. First, we have built an inducible differentiation circuit that closely resembles the endogenous differentiation pathway, to program cells to become cardiomyocytes. Second, we have built circuits that use the extracellular domains of chimeric proteins to target cells to damaged cardiac tissue. Upon binding, novel receptor-coupled intein-mediated signaling domains activate effector genes that then aid in integration, inhibition of cell death, and the alteration of the tissue microenvironment.

Andrew Mendelsohn
Dr. Andrew Mendelsohn is an Assistant Professor at Regenerative Sciences Institute and has sponsored a co-university iGEM team consisting of UC Berkeley and Stanford University students for the last two years. His goal is to expose young minds to cutting edge research in the fields of molecular and synthetic biology. He hopes that the iGEM team's project will serve as the springboard for research that will eventually translate into real world therapies. Through Dr. Mendelsohn's efforts, RSI also offers year round undergraduate programs to continue research of promising iGEM projects.
Pokie
""We are unknown to ourselves, we men of knowledge-and with good reason"" - Nietzsche
In the pursuit of the truth we look towards ourselves. And each in our our own way, in our own time, on our terms, and some not at all - we shall end full circle - at the beginning of nothingness.
Ego sum veritas, veritas von liberat.
Science as my conduit to freedom, affords me the chance to give my imagination a corporeal existence. And therefore, allows me to be truly free.
Joshua Resa
Joshua is a senior at Stanford University, deviously working on a master plan that will enable him to stay in school forever. Hs is fascinated by the universe, by science, physics, chemistry, and biology (ignoring math, in order of the xkcd comic, you know the one). He wonders at the amazing intricacies of how stuff works and frustrated by what doesn't. He hopes to figure out the former and, with luck, fix what's broken. This project and IGEM in general have provided a wealth of experience and ideas, of problem solving and problem belly flops (you must imagine how that feels). It was a great experience.
Sean Allen
Sean Allen is a 4th year Molecular and Cell Biology major with an emphasis on Immunology. After graduating in the Spring of 2009, he plans on taking a year off to work and study for the GRE. From there on, graduate school and research are his primary goals.
Simina Ticau
I'm currently a third year Bioengineering student at UC Berkeley. I'm interested in synthetic biology and am planning on going to graduate school after I graduate. This project was an amazing experience for me and has taught me a lot about a field I'm currently thinking of pursuing.

My Colleagues
 
Overview Step1 Step2
Zejun YAN is an undergraduate Biologist in Edinburgh University. I am interested in Biology in general, and is going to specialize in biotechnology in my honour year 2008/2009. By working on iGEM 2008 project with the rest of our team, I have alreay gained a lot in different aspects of biology. Importantly, I have got the opportunities to apply the theories I have learnt in the past 3 years to the daily work in our lab. Meanwhile, the ten-week lab working really shows me the insight of the real biology in the lab, and gives me really good lab experiences. Finally, all members of iGEM team have built good friendship by working and helping with each other through the whole summer.
I am also interested in education in general. However, my main interest in education is about the difference in education system between China and UK. I have been thinking about this since I came to UK six years ago, and also writing down some thoughts. So far, my main concern about the education is that 'always study actively', which is the key to the success!I will continue my writing on the way to my success in academic biology study.  After undergraduate, I will continue my academic study for another 4 year or so, because the more actively I sutdy, the more I can get out of it!
My hobbies are football, travelling and cooking (Although I have not been cooking last year, Because my female flatmate did all the cooking for me). Cooking has become my interest since I lived alone six years ago!
I spent most of my time in the lab and gained a lot of experiences and skills, you will see me presenting the biological parts of our iGEM 08' summer project in MIT. I am so looking forward to seeing people from different countries in the world!

Who are we?
We are the first Illinois iGEM team, and we're very excited about that fact.  Our team has a diverse mix of backgrounds drawing students from all over campus.  The represented departments include bioengineering, physics, electrical engineering, chemistry, and molecular and cellular biology.  This broad background gives us a the ability to look at problems from many angles and come up with unique solutions.  Under the guidance of our advisers we have been working to put together a project to bring to MIT this November.  We have all thoroughly enjoyed the opportunity that iGEM has given us, and look forward to being a competitive team in the future.

Interesting Notes
1. All the girls on the team have names that end in ""A"".
2. The platypus has no nipples. It secretes milk through its skin.
3. Humans are superorganisms whose metabolism represents an amalgamation of microbial and human attributes.
4. Daniel M. Choi is responsible for the explosion of his own iPod headphones with a non-resonating circuit placed more than 3 feet away from the apparatus he was working on.
""It somehow seems that biologists start to go engineer when they are at their wits' end and engineers go biology they are at their  wits' end. Synthetic biology is probably neither biology nor engineering and that's good as both kind of people have to think outside their boxes.""

In Pichia pastoris, alcohol oxidase (AOX) is the first enzyme in the methanol utilization pathway.  This enzyme is encoded by the AOXI gene.  If exposed to an environment containing both methanol and ethanol, P. pastoris preferentially metabolizes ethanol.  The production of the AOX enzyme is subject to the concentration of ethanol.  This diauxic metabolism may be utilized as an ethanol sensor.  When the AOXI promoter is fused with a gene encoding a fluorescent protein, the activation of the AOXI promoter may be detected by direct observation of fluorescence. Our project is the development of a device containing the AOXI promoter fused with a fluorescent protein gene to create an inexpensive ethanol sensor for a variety of applications. The concentration of ethanol in the environment may be deduced from the time period between exposure of bacteria carrying the device to ethanol and methanol, until the detection of fluorescence.
We're here to save the world.

Undergraduates
Sandy Sun
Sandy Sun, a senior at Duke from Boyds, Maryland, is majoring in Biomedical Engineering with a minor in Chemistry. She is currently working on the bioplastics project in Dr. Tian's lab as a Pratt Fellow. After graduation, Sandy plans on attending medical school and hopes to specialize in pediatric oncology. In her free time, she enjoys swimming, being a teaching assistant for chemistry lab, and working on Passport, Duke's international Magazine.
Vincent Ling
Vincent Ling is a senior at Duke University, double majoring in biomedical engineering and economics. He started working in Dr. Tian's lab in spring 2008 through the Duke Pratt Fellows Program and will continuing his research project until graduation. Outside of the lab, he organizes large-scale concerts at Duke as Program Director of Duke University Union (DUU) Major Attractions. He also enjoys the drums, piano, tennis, and running. Vincent plans on going to law school to study intellectual property law.
Lisa Zhang
Lisa Zhang is a freshman at Duke University.  She is currently enrolled in the Trinity School of Arts and Sciences.  Out of the current Duke iGEM team, Lisa has the most experience, having done iGEM last year.  Lisa enjoys mudkips as well as playing the violin.
Under-Undergraduates (High School-ers)
Kevin S. Chien
Kevin S. Chien was a singular inspiration in the lives of all whom he knew. His ever-present cheer, his quiet genius, and his genuine concern for the well-being of others all served to make his existence an indelible influence upon the memories of others. Kevin’s contagious enthusiasm and love for life were apparent in all he did—whether it was music, lacrosse (of which he was an avid fan and participant), or Frisbee, Kevin’s whole-hearted commitment provided stellar, inspiring leadership. As a bright light in the lives of all those who he loved and loved him, he will be missed but remembered by all as an upright, selfless, warm friend. He is currently well, in attendance at the North Carolina School of Science and Mathematics, and will be attending iGEM 2008. (written by Sam Wu)
Sam ""The Kid"" Wu (the one being pummeled)
Sam B. Wu, 16, oft noted for usage of excessive verbiage, none of which contains any substance pertinent to subject matters at hand, currently is a second-year pupil at the North Carolina School of Science and Mathematics.  His unconstructive and nonsensical whims, none of which are—needless to say—relevant enough to mention in this scant space, occupy much of his likewise unremarkable life. When he can be roused to pursue tasks of any perceived value however, he partakes in violin-playing, soccer, and obscure logic problems. Chief interests of his are acts of gluttony in locales of fine dining and lying awake thinking about thinking about nothing. In spite of his obvious shortcomings and young age, he enjoys making new acquaintances and hopes to make yours shortly.
Peter Zhu
Peter Zhu is a senior at North Carolina School of Science and Mathematics and is one of three high school students on Duke University’s iGEM team. When he is not busy trying to get into college, he is playing tennis, breakdancing and chilling. Though he has many talents including piano, contrabass and Starcraft, he does somewhat struggle with proper ""Engrish"". Therefore, he will keep his biography short and hopefully grammar-error-free.
Leadership is the art of getting someone else to do something you want done because he wants to do it.
- Dwight D. Eisenhower

Team:Warsaw/Team
From 2008.igem.org
We heard about iGEM from UW alumni doing their PhD thesis abroad. Few people were interested in participating and started to form the team late autumn 2007. The basic idea of our project was developed and selected from many others during one of the brainstorms on our campus. Having the project idea our group started to grow and we needed to find a supervisor. After a debate we have chosen prof. Jacek Bielecki from Applied Microbiology department, who enthusiastically supported our idea of participation in iGEM'08. During next few months we got support from authorities of our faculty and we were ready to start raising funds. In the meantime more people have joined our group. In may we have begun work on our project.

Our team
The leading idea behind our Ecoli.PROM team was to put in touch students with different curricula, ways to approach scientific problems and favour ideas exchange. These students, pushed by their common desire for new experiences, decided to participate in this exciting competition to discover a new research field and to expand their interest for synthetic biology. Responding to the call of Professor Silvio Cavalcanti, they constituted the Bologna iGEM team, finally composed of students from Biotechnology, Electronics Engineering and Biomedical Engineering faculties.
Up
ECM Lab
The Igem2008 Bologna team worked in the Laboratory of Cellular and Molecular Engineering for the Study of Bionanosystems (ECM lab). The lab research is focused on the application of bionanotechnology. IGEM students found here the main tools to carry out the project. Libraries, study rooms and computer rooms were also available to gather brainstorming, Internet searches and any activity related to the project.
Up
Our University
The origins of the University of Bologna are ancient: its foundation dates back to the year 1088, as it was conventionally established in the last century by a group of historians led by the Italian Nobel Laureate, Giosuè Carducci. Important scholars, writers, philosophers and poets such as Dante Alighieri, Francesco Petrarch, Guido Guinizelli, Cino da Pistoia, Cecco d'Ascoli, Re Enzo, Salimbene da Parma and Coluccio Salutati spent periods of study in Bologna during their life. At the moment the university counts 23 faculty, houses about 100000 students and has didactical head-quarters in Reggio Emilia and Imola and four scientific poles in Romagna, respectively in Ravenna, Forlì, Cesena and Rimini. In addition afford a school of excellence, the Collegio Superiore and a detached head-quarter in Buenos Aires.
In Cesena , the birth of a university centre was probably connected to the foundation of the Collegio dei Giuristi (College of Jurists), which was a concession of Pope Julius II in 1504, but only in 1989 the first degree course was activated, thanks to the Cassa di Risparmio di Cesena, which has supplied through SER.IN.AR. S.p.a. (a company specifically founded for this purpose) the financial resources required to the creation of laboratories, a library and other educational infrastructures.
The new reality has then represented a significant example for a further development of the University of Bologna towards the Romagna territory, which had no university structures at the time. In the last decades, thanks to the commitment of the University of Bologna and to the contribution of local entities, the teaching offer of Cesena  has gradually expanded in accordance with the acquisition and the creation of new infrastructures for the location of classrooms, offices and high-tech laboratories.
In 2001, as a consolidation of this process, the Polo Scientifico-Didattico of Cesena  has been founded within the Multi-Campus Project of the University of Bologna: this is the scenery in which, in 2002, the II Faculty of Engineering was established. The Biomedical Engineering curriculum, which characterizes the new faculty, mirrors the economical reality of Emilia Romagna, which houses one of the most important disctricts of Biomedical devices design and manufacturing.

Facts
The Hawaii team really likes gummi bears and cookies.  Our gummy bear diet can be (and often has been) substituted with Swedish Fish .
At the highest consumption rate, we devoured two pounds of gummy bears during a three hour meeting.
When combined, Grace's and Krystle's initials are a palindrome (KSGSK).  Norman claims they speak and dress alike to confuse faculty and advisors.

Team Biographies
Anne Van Devender - Student Member
Anne Van Devender
Anne Van Devender is a 4th year undergraduate at Washington and Lee University (Lexington, VA).  She is a Computer Science major with a minor in Women's Studies.  After graduation she hopes to attend graduate school for either a master's degree or PhD in Human Computer Interaction.
Her main endeavor outside of academics is the Washington and Lee Women's Soccer team where she is captain and a three-year letter winner.  In 2007, she was named to the NSCAA All-America team.  When she is not on the field or in the classroom, she enjoys working with kids in the Lexington community including involvement in a literacy campaign and teaching middle school girls the basics of computer science.
This summer she is participating in the Summer Undergraduate Program in Engineering Research at Berkeley (SUPERB) and working with the iGEM 2008 UC Berkeley Computational Team. She is using Java to write an ""Algorithm Manager"" for the Clotho tool.  While she has used Java extensively in her coursework at W&L, the synthetic biology aspect of the project is completely new to her.  The last time she took biology was in 9th grade! She hopes this project will not only improve her research skills in computer science, but will also enlighten her to the emerging field of synthetic biology.
Nade Sritanyaratana - Student Member
Nade Sritanyaratana
Nade Sritanyaratana is a 4th year undergraduate at the University of California, Berkeley. He is majoring in Bioengineering with a concentration in imaging, and hopes to apply for a PhD graduate program in the upcoming year. Beyond imaging, his academic interests include Biomechanics; signals and systems; circuit analysis; systems biology; and linear optimization.
His prior research experience consists of working with bioengineering professor Steven Conolly in the Summer and Fall of 2007. During that summer, he designed a coil helmet with an induced Maxwell magnetic field . This magnetic coil could be worn on the head and activated to generate small magnetic waves, soothing the wearer. Nicknamed the “Happy Helmet”, it was designed to non-invasively treat the bipolar-depressed via magnetic stimulation. Once fully developed, the helmet was to cost a hundred-fold less than an fMRI , the current primary treatment to bipolar depression.
This summer Nade is working full-time with the iGEM 2008 Cal Computational Team. This is his first time using Java. Prior to Java, his programming experience included an introductory C++ class in the 9th grade and MATLAB experience for three years in Berkeley. He has had prior experience with computational modeling in general; last year Nade worked with LabVIEW for his introductory class to signals and systems. Last fall he graphically modeled a growing brain tumor with ADINA for his Biomechanics class, and later based his main Biofluid mechanics project on the dynamics of a atherosclerotic artery using a computational model generated by COMSOL.
Matthew Johnson - Student Member
Matthew L.E. Johnson
Matthew Johnson is currently starting up his senior year at the University of California, Berkeley.  He is a Bioengineering major focusing on cell & tissue engineering, with a passionate interest in regenerative science and synthetic biology.  He is also enthusiastic about nanotechnology, BioMEMS, molecular biology, product design, economics, and writing.
Matt has lofty ambitions, and thinks that applied science is the key to solving many of life's problems, maybe even including the big one at the end of it.  He is very interested in how bioengineering and synthetic biology can be used to improve living conditions for people all over the world, whether through novel medical treatments, cheaper, cleaner sources of replenishable energy, or the development of heartier and healthier food crops.  Outside of science, one of of his biggest interests is taekwondo, which he started his freshman year at Cal and has involved himself extensively with ever since.  He believes that the discipline and physical training has improved his life, and he just loves getting a chance to compete - win or lose, there's always something to learn.
This summer was one of his first major research efforts.  He'd had experience programming in Java many years before, but had to learn it again from the ground-up for iGEM, though familiarity with Perl and programming in general helped considerably.  Due to a martial arts-related injury, he was gone for the last third of the summer, but he continued to code from his home in Bakersfield, CA while he recuperated.  He hopes to help in the future development of Clotho in his spare time, to create an even more useful and functional tool to aid synthetic biologists in their research.
Dr. Douglas Densmore - Instructor
Douglas Densmore
Douglas Densmore received his Bachelors of Science in Engineering (Computer Engineering) from the University of Michigan in April 2001. He received his Masters of Science in Electrical Engineering in May 2004 from the University of California at Berkeley. His masters thesis was entitled, ""Platform Based Reconfigurable Architecture Exploration via Boolean Constraints"" and demonstrated how Boolean Satisfiability could be used to produce configurations for programmable hardware. He received his PhD in Electrical Engineering from UC Berkeley as well in May 2007. His PhD thesis, entitled ""A Design Flow for the Development, Characterization, and Refinement of System Level Architecture Services"", explored how electronic system level design methodologies can be abstract and modular while at the same time remaining accurate and efficient.
He is currently a UC Chancellor's post doctoral researcher at UC Berkeley studying under Prof. Alberto Sangiovanni-Vincentelli . His research area is in the development of System Level Design methodologies for electronic systems. Specifically, architecture modeling and refinement verification. His background and interests are in Computer Architecture, Logic Synthesis, Digital Logic Design and Synthetic Biology.
His industry experience includes four+ summers with Intel Corporation where he was involved in pre-silicon design efforts regarding chipset development, post-silicon validation of the Pentium 4 microprocessor, and chipset software validation. He has also worked as a researcher at Cypress Semiconductor and Xilinx Research Labs. He is currently a member of the Gigascale Systems Research Center (GSRC) and the Center for Hybrid and Embedded Software Systems (CHESS) at UC Berkeley. He has published work regarding a method of successive refinement verification of electronic systems, taxonomies of EDA design tools, and algebraic frameworks for the manipulation of functional design descriptions to expose computational parallelism. In addition he has a US patent pending regarding data characterization of programmable devices (such as field programmable gate arrays).

Dr. Chris Anderson
Prof. Anderson provided specifications for what tools and techniques should be incorporated in Clotho. In addition he also helped to define the general assembly problem for standardized biological parts as well as provide the context in which the tool would be used. He also provided many interesting discussion regarding the Clotho data model and provided the database by which we did the majority of our testing.
Other attribution
Many thanks to Collin Martin for the professional photography shots, and the Comp team shot.
Shout out goes to Cici Chen of the UC Berkeley wetlab for helping design the Clotho title (alpha). Also Brian Zimmer, Bing Xia, and Roger Tu also have contributed to the development of Clotho. Josh Kittleson was instrumental in the development of the mySQL/PoBoL connection and tools. Will Deloache helped with the development of the assembly algorithms for 2ab assembly that is in the tool.
Where we're from
Dr. Douglas Densmore
Doug is from Richland, Michigan which is a small town outside of Kalamazoo. He attended the University of Michigan from 1996-2001 and has been in Berkeley, California since 2001. His family is from the Detroit area. They still live in Michigan.
Nade Sritanyaratana
Nade is a 4th year bioengineering undergraduate at UC Berkeley. He was born in the SF Bay Area, in Hayward, CA, and has lived around the Bay Area his entire life. Both of his parents are Thai. He attended James Logan High School in Union City, CA, where his primary activities included speech and debate, Leo Club, and the swim team. His family still resides in Union City.
Matthew L.E. Johnson
Matt is a SoCal native - born and raised in Bakersfield, CA right up until the move to Berkeley in 2005.  He loves his hometown, but realizes that it is an 'acquired taste', especially during the average summer's daily triple-digit heat.  Despite the vast differences between his new home and his old (with inverse climates - politically and meteorologically), he has adapted well and has been greatly enjoying his stay in the Bay Area.

From 2008.igem.org
Welcome to Johns Hopkins iGEM
        The International Genetically Engineered Machines Competition (iGEM) is an annual intercollegiate challenge that seeks to answer the question: ""Can simple biological systems be built from standard, interchangeable parts and operated in living cells? Or is biology simply too complicated to be engineered in this way?"" The newly-formed iGEM team at Johns Hopkins is composed of mostly undergraduate students with diverse majors ranging from Materials Science Engineering to Biology. While the team has graduate and faculty input, it is almost totally undergraduate run. The iGEM teams work over the summer at their, respective university, and then attend the iGEM Jamboree in November to present their work. We plan to create novel genetic parts that could be added to the existing iGEM registry of biological parts. The MIT iGEM Registry of Parts is the databank of biological standards to which iGEM teams from 2003 and onward have contributed. Currently, the databank only has 16 yeast ""biobricks"". These biobricks are reporters, tags, plasmids and other useful interchangeable genetic parts, that could one day revolutionize genetic and synthetic biology. By the end of our project, we will have most likely doubled the amount of yeast biobricks in the registry.

We are the Biomass Bandits from Mississippi State University.  Our team is made up of two undergraduate students, two graduate advisors, and two academic advisors.  Our undergrads are Sam Pote and Caleb Dulaney, the graduate advisors are Victor Ho and Robert Morris, and the academic advisors are Dr. Din-Pow Ma and Dr. Filip To.  The biofuel emphasis of our project was determined by the University and Dr. To.  The project idea, literature research, and laboratory research was performed exclusively by the two undergraduate students.  Our lab work was done under the supervision of Dr. Ma and the two graduate students.  We often learned the hard way through our mistakes and failures, but we really advanced our knowledge and experience in Synthetic Biology.  Furthermore, we have initiated work on an important problem in the world.  Overall, we have had a blast this summer working in the lab and trying to change the world one cell at a time.
Tell us more about your project.  Give us background.  Use this is the abstract of your project.  Be descriptive but concise (1-2 paragraphs)

What we did
The idea was spawned by Sam and Caleb.  The advisors and grad students refined the project and brought is back down to earth.  The lab work, wiki, and team management was done by the undergrads.  Dr. To, Dr. Ma, Victor and Robert kept careful watch over the lab work and helped us with problems.  We worked really hard due to our personnel limitations, but we were able to isolate our gene and submit it to the registry.
