We made a functional unit to regulate gene expression. BBa_K2015012 codes constitutive promoter ( BBa_J23101 ), RBS ( BBa_B0032 ), LacI ( BBa_C0012 ), dT ( BBa_B0015 ), PLac ( BBa_R0011 ) and RBS ( BBa_B0034 ). To insert mRFP at the downstream we identified this construct could regulate the expression (Fig. 1).

And also we induced BBa_K2015012 + BBa_K2015008 / BBa_K2015012 + BBa_K2015009 on pSB1C3 of E. coli (DH5α). BBa_K2015008 consists Self Assembling Regions (SAR, RADA16-I) and GFP. And BBa_K2015009 this part consists Self Assembling Region (SAR, P11-4) and GFP.
The results are shown the below pictures. The fluorescence of GFPs was not detected any condition.

BBa_K2015012-BBa_K2015008 on pSB1C3 vector were induced by IPTG and incubated at 37°C. (-): not induced, (+): 0.5 mM IPTG and (++): 1.0 mM IPTG

BBa_K2015012-BBa_K2015009 on pSB1C3 vector were induced by IPTG and incubated at 25°C for 24 h (left)
and at 37°C for 16 h (right). (-): not induced, (+): 0.5 mM IPTG and (++): 1.0 mM IPTG
