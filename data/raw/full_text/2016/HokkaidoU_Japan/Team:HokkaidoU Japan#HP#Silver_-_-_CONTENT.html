This event aims to answer questions such as &quot;What is DNA?&quot;, &quot;What is Gene Recommbination?&quot; and so on and deepen understanding of DNA and gene recommbination.
We conducted a poster session, an easy experiment &quot;Detection of DNA extraction from banana&quot; and crafting, &quot;crafting DNA keyholder&quot;.

<H3>Experiment</H3>
Participants can see the DNA with their eyes and feel more familiar to DNA.

<H2>protocol</H2><OL><LI>Crush one third of a banana with a spoon; to break its cell wall.</LI><LI>Mix well 10% saltine water 30 mL and detergent 2.5 mL; Saltine water makes nucleic acid and salt. Detergent breaks cell membrane.</LI><LI>Pour 1 and 2 into a beaker through coffee filter and filtrate them.</LI><LI>After 5 minutes or so, pour 100% ethanol 40 mL into the beaker slowly.</LI><LI>Then you’ll see some white lump. That’s exactly the DNA!!</LI></OL></SPAN><SPAN class="nomal2"><H2>Crafting</H2>
Participants craft a DNA keyholder and learn the structure of DNA.
They can take their work home.

In the lecture, we explained what gene recombination is and about this year’s our project. According to the questionnaire, we can see that majority had an adverse impression on gene recombination before the lecture, however, more than 90% of visitors appreciated its usefulness by the end. Also, more than 90% of the people answered they acquired new knowledge about gene, DNA, protein and gene recombination. Based on these statistics, we consider that we accomplished contributing to the public understanding about gene and its recombination – topics which still raise anxiety amongst many people in Japan probably due to ignorance. We believe that our efforts will help people create a society in the future that utilizes gene recombination.

We broadcast a talk about synthetic biology and iGEM toward people in Japan and Indonesia on Radio PPI Jepang, from 20:00 to 20:30 on July 28th, 2016. We believe people gained knowledge about syn-bio and iGEM through our talk.  We spoke in English, Japanese and Indonesian on the radio. Also, Radio PPI Jepang is an online radio that anyone can listen to if they have access to the internet, so we could successfully tell people about syn-bio and iGEM, especially Japanese people who had heard about the radio from Yusuke, and Indonesian people listening to the radio all over the world. We talked about 4 things: what syn-bio is like; its history; its benefits; about iGEM and iGEM HokkaidoU team. First, we told listeners that DNA codes proteins, and that it is like a cooking recipe book. Second, we spoke about the history of syn-bio, from the finding of DNA double helix model to Human Genome Project. Third, we suggested many benefits of syn-bio, such as curing diseases or cleaning polluted environment. Finally, we introduced iGEM and iGEM HokkaidoU team, about when and where iGEM started, what iGEMers do, and our project in 2016.   In conclusion, we succeeded in broadcasting about syn-bio and iGEM, and then enlightening people, especially Japanese and Indonesian people, with knowledge about syn-bio. After we finish the Giant Jamboree in 2016, we will again broadcast what iGEM’s Giant Jamboree is like,
and raise people’s interest in iGEM!
</SPAN></DIV><DIV><SPAN class="nomal2">We wrote an introduction about iGEM for school newsletter called “Gakunavi”.  The newsletter is for all the students at Hokkaido university, so we took care to make it easy to understand. We did not use difficult scientific words, and we compared iGEM with robot contest to make it easy for people to understand what iGEM is like. Also, we introduced about what Giant Jamboree is, and what our project this year is. Finally, we told students to search us “iGEM HokkaidoU.” People who read the newsletter said that they got interested in iGEM. We believe many students at Hokkaido university read it, got knowledge about iGEM, and got interested in iGEM!
