Project description
Hydrogel is used in contact lenses and diapers. Some kinds of hydrogel are made of self-assembling peptides. They are amphiphilic peptides and they form nanostructured hydrogel under physiochemical conditions. Recently, they have been considered as a good biological scaffold for cell culturing and drug delivering. They are synthesized chemically such as solid-state synthesis, but it’s not efficient for production in large amounts. So, we need another approach including biosynthesis.
In this research, we expressed self-assembling peptides such as
RADA-16 I and P11-4
in Escherichia coli and analyzed them by a series of experiments.
We also considered the application of hydrogel to immobilized proteins, which may enhance the stability of proteins. Immobilized proteins will be used in medicine and environmental study in the future.
