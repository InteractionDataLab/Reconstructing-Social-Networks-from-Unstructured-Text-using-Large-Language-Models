We attended the 88th Genetic Society of Japan and had a discussion with 5 Japanese iGEM teams (Gifu, HokkaidoU, Kyoto, Nagahama, and UT-tokyo). Our topics were how iGEM Japan would be in the future and reached a consensus of our apporopriate cooperation. We had a good oppotunity to exchange information and to deepen our friendship.
