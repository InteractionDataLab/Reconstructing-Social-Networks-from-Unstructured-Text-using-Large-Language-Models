by circularization using SAR. About the detailed concept of 
circularization, please read <A href="https://2016.igem.org/Team:HokkaidoU_Japan/Circularization">circularization page</A>. To think about the power 
of stabilization by 
circularization using SAP, we used HP (Hydrophobic-Polar) model. 
HP model is a kind of simplified protein folding model and in this model, 
protein chain is given as zig-zag stick on 2D lattice. Each residue has 
the characteristic H or P (Hydrophobic or Polar). To calculate the stability 
of protein structures, in this model, if an H residue is next to another H 
residue without covalent bond, it decreases free energy because of hydrophobic
 interaction. In our model, the decreased energy by each hydrophobic interaction
 is defined as -E<SPAN class="sitatuki">H</SPAN>. We added another
 characteristic SAR into this model. Through thinking about this model,
 we can simply think about the effect of SAR reflected as the effect to 
probability to fold as native state. We thought SAR interaction is so strong,
 so in the case we add SAR at N terminus and C terminus, both ends are set 
next to each other in the model. So, let's think about the simplest model.

The simplest model is the model with the number of residue is 
4 and the sequence is HPPH. In this case, without SAR, the number 
of states is 4, excluding enantiomers and rotamers. The possible states
 and the energy are listed below. K<SPAN class="sitatuki">B</SPAN> is Boltzmann constant 1.38064852*10<SUP>-23</SUP> (J/K), T is temperature (K).



<CENTER><TABLE style="border-style: none"><TBODY><TR><TD style="border-style: none;" align="center"><SPAN class="small">Fig. 1

</SPAN></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></CENTER>Only the first one is stable and its energy is -E<SPAN class="sitatuki">H</SPAN>. 
 Because it's most stable, we thought it's native state. 
The probability to fold as native state (P<SUP>wild</SUP><SPAN class="sitatuki">HPPH</SPAN>) is below.

To calculate this, we used canonical ensemble from statistical mechanics. The probability of causing state <SPAN class="italic">i</SPAN> is calculated through the function below.
E<SPAN class="sitatuki">i is the energy of state <SPAN class="italic">i</SPAN>, E<SARN class="sitatuki">j</SARN></SPAN> is the energy of the state <SPAN class="italic">j</SPAN>.



But with SAR, the number of states is 1 and the state is the most stable one.


<CENTER><TABLE style="border-style: none"><TBODY><TR><TD style="border-style: none"><SPAN class="small">Fig. 2

</SPAN></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></CENTER>The possibility to fold native conformation (P<SPAN class="sitatuki">HPPH</SPAN><SUP>SAR</SUP>) is of course 1.


Compared with both models, we can obviously think that thanks to the addition of SAR, we can increase the probability to fold correctly; the stability of native state is definitely increased.

Let's think about more complicated case. The number of residue is 6 and the sequence is HPPHPH. The possible states are shown below. Also, we excluded enantiomers and rotamers.


<CENTER><TABLE style="border-style: none"><TBODY><TR><TD style="border-style: none"><SPAN class="small">Fig. 3

</SPAN></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></CENTER>As we did in the simplest model, we 
thought the most stable state is the native state; 
the native state has -2E<SPAN class="sitatuki">H</SPAN>
 as its energy. In this case, the possibility to fold as 
native structure (P<SPAN class="sitatuki">HPPHPH</SPAN><SUP>wild</SUP>) is below.


With SAR, the possible states are shown below.



<CENTER><TABLE style="border-style: none"><TBODY><TR><TD style="border-style: none"><SPAN class="small">Fig. 4

</SPAN></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></CENTER>The probability to fold as native structure (P<SPAN class="sitatuki">HPPHPH</SPAN><SUP>SAR</SUP>) is below.



As we have shown in the simplest case, by the addition of SAR, the probability to fold correctly is definitely increased.


As we have shown, circularization using SAR 
can stabilize protein native structure. However, 
we should be careful about SAR' characteristic; 
SAR can limit the structure by circularization, 
but of course, if the stabilized structure is different 
from native structure, the addition of SAR means that 
it increase the stability of the denatured structure. 
This can be shown in the model. If we add SAR to the ends 
of HPHPHHPPPHHH model, the most stable structure is changed.


<CENTER><TABLE style="border-style: none"><TBODY><TR><TD style="border-style: none"><SPAN class="small">Fig. 5

</SPAN></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></CENTER>As shown above, native state's free energy is -5E<SPAN class="sitatuki">H</SPAN>, but stabilized structure's lowest energy is only -3E<SPAN class="sitatuki">H</SPAN>. This means that if we want to stabilize a protein with circularization using SAR, we have to be careful about the difference between its native structure and stabilized structure. If they have huge difference, we have to add linkers not to break its native structure by circularization using SAR.
