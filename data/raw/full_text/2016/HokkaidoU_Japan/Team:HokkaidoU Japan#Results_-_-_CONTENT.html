By fusing SAP to ends of a protein, it will condense with other proteins’ SAP domains and form complexes. The SAP domains is pinched by short linkers (SLs) that have cysteine residues. When the SAPs gather and SLs get close, disulfide bonds are formed between two SLs. So, we will make an unbreakable complex. By using this method, we’ll be able to connect several enzymes and allow huge complexed proteins to be formed. It’ll improve the efficiency of a continuous reaction.

Since the number of the possible combination of several different proteins is infinite, there is no guarantee that we can always obtain the expected combination.
One solution to the problem is limiting the number of combination by using different SAP. That can reduce probability of incorrect connection a little.</SPAN><TABLE style="border-style: none"><TBODY><TR align="center" style="border-style: none"><TD style="border-style: none; width:500px;"><SPAN class="small">Fig. 6.

As forming protein complex with different functions, this multimer let us create more functional units. When the same kinds of proteins are used, it’ll be a large block and its function is expected to be enhanced.
We tried to establish novel uses of SAP in this year. We tried to multimerize using SAPs.
</SPAN><SPAN class="nomal2">We tried forming multimers using the self-assembling peptide (SAP), P<SPAN class="sitatuki">11</SPAN>-4 (QQRFEWEFEQQ) and RADA16-I (RADARADARADARADA). And to make firm bonds we designed a short linker (GGCGG) called SL for short. We
connected SL and SAP to both ends of a protein. In this experiment, we used GFP as a fusion partner (Fig. 8).

When GFP is fused with P<SPAN class="sitatuki">11</SPAN>-4, the molecular weight of the fusion protein is estimated to be 31709 Da. Fused with RADA16-I, it’s 31943 Da. When they form a multimer, the molecular weight will be more 
than 60 kDa. Consequently, we used the filter which filters out the proteins with weight of more than 50 KDa.

For the evaluation, we ordered IDT the designed constructions and put them on the vectors. Then, 
we introduced them into <SPAN style="font-style: italic">E.coli</SPAN> and the protein expression was induced with IPTG. Causing bacteriolysis with freeze-thaw, we acquired the supernatant containing the proteins by centrifugal 
separation. Purifying the protein with Ni-affinity chromatography, we filtrated the solution
to separate the proteins with weight of less than 50KDa. We irradiated 480 nm light to filtrate and observed 
whether 580 nm wave-length light was emitted.</DIV></SPAN><SPAN class="nomal2">We inserted SAP-GFP-SAP coding reasion (Fig. 8) into pET15b vector and the fusion protein was expressed (Fig. 10). As a negative control we made a construct containing GFP alone (Fig. 11). GFPs with SAPs and SLs was expected to form multiple complexes (Fig. 12).

If GFPs form multiple complexes, we would reveal that SAPs could recruit proteins. But we couldn't get the colony that had SAP-GFP-SAP on pET15b vector.
So, we changed our strategy to making other constructs, that are, <A href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K2015012">BBa_K2015012</A>-<A href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K2015008">BBa_K2015008</A> on pSB1C3 and <A href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K2015012">BBa_K2015012</A>-<A href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K2015009">BBa_K2015009</A> on pSB1C3. Our biobrick <A href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K2015012">BBa_K2015012</A> was designed to code LacI and have PLac. Both <A href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K2015008">BBa_K2015008</A> and <A href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K2015009">BBa_K2015009</A> code SAP-GFP-SAP, but former has RADA16-I parts and latter has P<SPAN class="sitatuki">11</SPAN>-4 parts.
We inserted them into pSB1C3 vector and verified whether our device went well. But the fluorescence of GFPs was not detected any condition (Fig. 13 and 14).

When RFP was inserted to it, we could see fluorescence (<A href="https://2016.igem.org/Team:HokkaidoU_Japan/Proof">Proof</A>). So, this units would be well. We thought GFPs were expressed but their functions were lost. There is a possibility of forming inclusion bodies because of SAPs. We need to examine whether GFPs are produced using SDS-PAGE.
Our constructs have two <SPAN style="font-style: italic">Bam</SPAN>HI sites at upstream and downstream of GFP. Therefore, anyone can cut out the GFP and insert any protein of interest which has <SPAN style="font-style: italic">Bam</SPAN>HI sites at both ends. our construct permits anyone to make multi-complex-enzyme(Fig. 15).
