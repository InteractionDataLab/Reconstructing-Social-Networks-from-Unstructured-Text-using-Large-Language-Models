Demonstrate your work
We helped iGEM Gifu.
First of all, we wanted to make the project of our team and that of iGEM Gifu better.We thought the best way is as follows.
Presentation of team projects and discussion
Our team and the iGEM Gifu team carry out discussion based on presentation and gave feedbacks to each other.
