Enhancement of farnesol resistance
Fig. ?: Colony formation efficiencies of E. coli JM109 engineered with marA on geraniol overlaid plates.
E. coli JM109 and E. coli JM109 (marA) were spotted on LBGMg agar plates in serial ten-fold dilutions (10⁻¹～10⁻6), overlaid with 30.0 % (v/v) fanesol hexane solution (farnesol solution), and incubated at 30°C for 24 h. This figure shows that E. coli JM109 (marA) cells that overexpress the marA product is more survived on 30.0 % farnesol solution overlay plates than the counterpart control E. coli JM109  wild type cells.

Fig. 14: Comparison of colony numbers after addition of 0.5 %( v/v) geraniol hexane solution (geraniol solution).
Time interval for treatment was set every 1 hour from 1 hour to 4 hours. A: E. coli JM109 (WT) + hexane; B: E. coli JM109 (marA) + hexane; C: E. coli JM109 (WT) + 0.5 % geraniol solution; D: E. coli JM109 (marA) + 0.5 % geraniol solution. As shown in Figs. 14 A and B, treatment with hexane of E. coli JM109 (WT) and of E. coli JM109 (marA) showed similar colony numbers during these treatment intervals to those of time zero. This result suggests that hexane at this concentration and duration of time for 4hours did not affect both cell growth. In contrast, treatment with geraniol of E. coli JM109 (WT) and of E. coli JM109 (marA) showed toxicities to both strains (Figs. 14 B, C and D). If we watch the colony numbers carefully, E. coli JM109 (marA) had more than E. coli JM109 (WT) during these treatment intervals ((Figs. 14 C and D). These results demonstrate that toxicity of the geraniol was less to the strain E. coli JM109 (marA) than the strain E. coli JM109 (WT).

We reinforced by overexpressing genes that dxs,idi,ispD and ispF, which was the bottom neck of MEP route. GC-MS detected synthetic amount of farnesol was very low. We checked amount of transcription by RT-PCR and q-PCR.
