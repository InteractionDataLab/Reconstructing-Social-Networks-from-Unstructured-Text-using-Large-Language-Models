We aimed to manufacture Flavorator by using various methods and to commercialize it. We performed demonstration. Flavorator is a system to release fragrance which Escherichia coli made farnesol. Flavorator preserve food by fragrance. For this reason, Flavorator does not need electricity.
Fig1- Comparison of the suppressing effect of geraniol, farnesol and ethanol on mold.png
A: geraniol(100 μl of geraniol solution was dropped on the cotton）B:farnesol(100 μl) C: ethanol (100 μl )
A:Chopstick dipped in suspension of mold was touched in the center of the bread. The volume of box is 846cm³.
B:The same treatment was done. C:The same treatment was done. These boxes were kept for 5 days at room temperature.
Farnesol had the highest antifungal activity against mold. We found that farnesol has high antifungal activity against the mold of bread.  Therefore, we investigated whether farnesol exerts similar antifungal effects on other food.
Fig2:Effects of farnesol on bread mold.
A: farnesol(1ml of farnesol solution was dropped on the cotton), B:ddH2O(1ml).
A:Chopstick dipped in suspension of mold was touched in the center of the bread. The volume of box is 846cm³.
B: The same treatment was done. These boxes were kept for 8 days at room temperature.
Fig3:Effects of farnesol on rice mold.
A: farnesol(1ml of farnesol solution was dropped on the cotton), B:ddH2O(1ml).
A:Chopstick dipped in suspension of mold was touched in the center of the rice. The volume of box is 846cm³.
B: The same treatment was done. These boxes were kept for 8 days at room temperature.
Fig4: Effects of farnesol on chicken mold.
A: farnesol(1ml of farnesol solution was dropped on the cotton), B:ddH2O(1ml).
A:Chopstick dipped in suspension of rotten meat was touched in the center of the chicken. The volume of box is 846cm³.
B: The same treatment was done. These boxes were kept for 8 days at room temperature.
We found that farnesol has a preservative effect on various foods. So, we think about commercialization of "Flavorator" in the future.
