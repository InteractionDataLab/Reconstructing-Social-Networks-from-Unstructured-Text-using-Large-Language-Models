Increased production of fragrance for new food preservation method E.coli
ABSTRACT
To innovate the refrigerator without electricity, we invented a prototype of FRAVORATOR that is possible to preserve food by antibacterial volatiles synthesized by Escherichia coli. For the high-efficiency synthetic process of preservation flavor, farnesol, we focused on improving its synthetic pathway. First, 1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate（DXP）synthase, Dxs, is down-regulated when its downstream material has been produced to some extent. So, we tried to over-express, another DXP synthase, nDXP, that rarely has been used in normal conditions. Also, we created fusion gene for ispC-ribB protein for enzymatic function. Second, to avoid recombinant in the real usage, we tried to knock out synthase that produces unnecessary byproduct by genome editing.

We certainly achieved GOLD Medal Criteria!
Bronze Medal
1
Register for iGEM, have a great summer, and attend the Giant Jamboree.
Yes, we are looking forward to taking part in the Giant Jamboree.
2
Meet all deliverables on the Requirements page (section 3).
We meet all requirements.
3
Create a page on your team wiki with clear attribution of each aspect of your project. This page must clearly attribute work done by the students and distinguish it from work done by others, including host labs, advisors, instructors, sponsors, professional website designers, artists, and commercial services.
Please check Here .
4
Document at least one new standard BioBrick Part or Device central to your project and submit this part to the iGEM Registry (submissions must adhere to the iGEM Registry guidelines). You may also document a new application of a BioBrick part from a previous iGEM year, adding that documentation to the part's main page.
Please check Here .
Silver Medal
1
Experimentally validate that at least one new BioBrick Part or Device of your own design and construction works as expected. Document the characterization of this part in the Main Page section of the Registry entry for that Part/Device. This working part must be different from the part you documented in Bronze medal criterion #4. Submit this part to the iGEM Parts Registry.
We created 3 new BioBrick devices for silver medal criterion. Please look at BBa_K1950010 , BBa_K1950008 , and BBa_K1950007 .
2
Convince the judges you have helped any registered iGEM team from a high-school, different track, another university, or institution in a significant way by, for example, mentoring a new team, characterizing a part, debugging a construct, modeling/simulating their system or helping validate a software/hardware solution to a synthetic biology problem.

3
iGEM projects involve important questions beyond the lab bench, for example relating to (but not limited to) ethics, sustainability, social justice, safety, security, and intellectual property rights. Demonstrate how your team has identified, investigated, and addressed one or more of these issues in the context of your project. Your activity could center around education, public engagement, public policy issues, public perception, or other activities (see the human practices hub for more information and examples of previous teams' exemplary work).
Please check here .
Gold Medal
1
Expand on your silver medal activity by demonstrating how you have integrated the investigated issues into the design and/or execution of your project.
Please check here .
2
Improve the function OR characterization of an existing BioBrick Part or Device and enter this information in the Registry. Please see the Registry help page on how to document a contribution to an existing part. This part must NOT be from your 2016 part number range.
Please check here .
3
Demonstrate a functional proof of concept of your project. Your proof of concept must consist of a BioBrick device; a single BioBrick part cannot constitute a proof of concept. (Remember, biological materials may not be taken outside the lab.)
Please check here .
4
Show your project working under real-world conditions. To achieve this criterion, you should demonstrate your whole system, or a functional proof of concept working under simulated conditions in the lab (Remember, biological materials may not be taken outside the lab.)
Please check here .
