Proof of concept
Demonstrate your work
We explained our project and synthetic biology to the local people.Furthermore, in order to make our project and synthetic biology known nationwide, we used website, television programs, newspapers and radio.As a result, we received some useful feedbacks from the general public.Two of the feedbacks raised very important issued. First issue "Fragrance on food"When food is kept an ‘Flavorator’, the fragrance might adhere to the food that you want to preserve.Second issue "Recombinant, may go out of the laboratory. ⇒Recombinant releases"Each solution of these problems to be integrated with the project.
About the first issue
We decided to use farnesol from the scent ingredient, with antibacterial properties, because it is almost odorless.This was the target, and solve the first Issue.
About the second issue
A method in which antimicrobial volatile gaseous substances synthesized using only the endogenous gene of E. coli.Specifically, we used the CRISPR-Cas9.Gene of extra in pathway to synthesis of farnesol, unnecessary intermediate metabolite (non-essential) synthase gene, knocked out.Gene involved in farnesol synthesized by those of endogenous E. coli knock in.Two issues are solved by these solutions.Integrated was completed.
