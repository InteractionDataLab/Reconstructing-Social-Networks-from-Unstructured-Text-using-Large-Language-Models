ＭarA
This device makes Escherichia coli have the resistance of farnesol. Actually, we confirmed resistance of farnesol by MarA.
Colony formation of E. coli JM109 engineered with marA on farnesol overlaid plates.
Fig.7:Colony formation of E. coli JM109 engineered with marA on farnesol overlaid plates.
E.coli JM109 and E.coli JM109 (marA) were dropped on LBGMg agar plates in serial ten-fold dilutions (10⁻¹～〖10〗^(-6)), overlaid with 30 % (v/v) farnesol hexane solution (farnesol solution) and incubated at 30°C for 24 h. This figure shows that E.coli JM109 (marA) cells that overexpress the marA product better than the control E.coli JM109 wild type cells survived plates overloyed by 30 % farnesol solution.
From the results, the device we built performs its desired function.
