<partinfo>BBa_K1230000 short</partinfo>
The MarA protein acts as a transcriptional activator in E. coli, it allows the expression of the acrAB and tolC operons, which activate the AcrAB-TolC efflux pump, a mechanism that has been related with resistance to organic solvents, dyes, detergents, antibiotics such as chloramphenicol, tetracycline, novobiocin, erythromycin, fusidic acid and cloxacillin, as well as to cationic antimicrobial peptides, such as LL-37, HNP-2 and HBD-1.
We used device BBa_K1230004 to characterise this part.
Team iGEM Nagahama 2015
We improved the characterization of a previously existing BioBrick Part BBa_K1230000 and submitted this improved BioBrick marA gene as BBa_K1653006 to iGEM Registry.
Team Nagahama 2016
We improved the characterization of existing this Part BBa_K1230000 . We found that marA expression is also improve resistance to farnesol. Result page is here
