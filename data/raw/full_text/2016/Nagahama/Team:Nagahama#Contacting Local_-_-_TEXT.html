We want to produce Flavorators all over the world.It is our dream.
Our dream is complete that when everybody in the world use a Flavorator.We need to get advice (improve point, safety, cost, and cognition.etc)From difference people.(Farmers,Economists,Family,and engineers.etc)
We inform people of our activities by many approaches.This activity could also know iGEM and Flavorator to public.
