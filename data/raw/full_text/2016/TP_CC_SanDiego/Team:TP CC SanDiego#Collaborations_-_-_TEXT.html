UCLA iGEM COLLABORATION
On September 23 we met with UCLA’s iGEM team via Skype. During this meeting, we discussed details of our project’s goals, progress, and impact. In particular, we shared what new updates we’ve made to our experiment from last year, discussing what changes worked better. This included updates to our secretion system, and updates to our method of analyzing chitinase gene expression via FLAG-tag. UCLA iGEM gave us advice on how to expand our chitinase project, especially regarding ways to create a chitin medium that would enable us to test whether the chitinase was working. We also shared ideas for human practices, discussing public outreach strategies that have worked and failed for us in the past. We also provided key suggestions to help UCLA iGEM with cell-cell adhesion as well as growth inhibition.
