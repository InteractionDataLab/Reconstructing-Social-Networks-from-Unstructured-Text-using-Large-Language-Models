After construction was complete, our promoters were tested in a variety of cell lines under different hormone conditions. Cells were first seeded into a 24 well plate and allowed to grow for one day in order to reach confluency. The next day cells were transiently transfected with a <B>promoter readout plasmid</B> that contained our promoter upstream of <A href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K2100005">eYFP</A>, as well as with a <B>constitutively active transfection marker</B><A href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K2100012">hEF1a mKate</A>. Depending on the cell line and the ease with which it could be transfected, either <B>cationic lipid transfection</B> or <B>electroporation</B> were used to deliver plasmid DNA to cells.  </P><P> Twelve to twenty four hours after transfection, cells were induced with either <B> estradiol (E2)</B>, an estrogen hormone produce by the ovaries, or <B> medroxyprogesterone actetate (MPA) </B>, a progesterone analog. Twelve to twenty four hours after hormone induction, cells were prepared for <B>flow cytometry</B> in order to probe for the response to hormone on a population scale. Flow cytometry data was then analyzed using the open source Python toolbox, <A href="http://bpteague.github.io/cytoflow/">Cytoflow</A>, which enabled us to bin our data by the transfection marker <A href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K2100012">hEF1a mKate</A>. This kind of analysis proves critical for comparing populations of cells that have been transiently transfected, because transient transfection procedures result in an uneven distribution of plasmids across the cell population. Binning the data allows us to compare cells which received roughly the same copy numbers of our two plasmids across different populations. Else, comparing cells that received a greater copy number of the plasmid to those which received less could result in skewing of the data towards a positive result. </P><P>Since we plan on deploying our diagnostic in an endometrial biopsy which contains a heterogeneous population of epithelial and stromal cells, it was critical to test the functionality of our promoters in a variety of cell lines. The cell lines our promoters were deployed in include the following: </P><UL><LI><B>MCF7.</B> A standard steroid receptor positive cell line derived from breast adenocarcinoma that was used to prototype our estrogen and progesterone signaling sensors.</LI><LI><B>Ishikawa.</B> An epithelial cell line derived from endometrial adenocarcinoma. These cells were used to test how our promoters would function in epithelial tissue from an endometrial biopsy.  </LI><LI><B>tHESC.</B> A cell line of TERT-immortalized Human Endometrial Stromal Cells. These cells were used to test how our promoters would function in stromal tissue from an endometrial biopsy.  </LI></UL><P> The MCF7, Ishikawa, and tHESC cell lines were provided through a <B>collaboration that we initiated</B> with the Griffith Lab at MIT affiliated with the <A href="http://web.mit.edu/cgr/">Center for Gynepathology Research</A> at MIT. Graduate students there advised us on the best practices for culturing cells and what concentrations of E2 and MPA would best simulate the proliferative and luteal phase of the menstrual cycle.</P><H1 style="color:#FFFFFF;background-color:#F20253;; -moz-border-radius: 15px; -webkit-border-radius: 15px; padding:15px; text-align: center; font-family: Trebuchet MS"> Promoter Architectures</H1><P> We tested several promoters that contained binding sites (ERE) for the human estrogen receptor and binding sites (PRE) for the human progesterone receptor upstream of a minimal CMV promoter: </P><UL><LI><B>pERE-#n.</B> A promoter that contains n binding sites for ER in front of a minimal CMV promoter. n = <A href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K2100000">3</A>, <A href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K2100001">5</A>,<A href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K2100002"> 6</A>. </LI><LI><B>pPRE-#n.</B>  A promoter that contains n binding sites for ER in front of a minimal CMV promoter. n = <A href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K2100008"> 3</A>, <A href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K2100009">4</A>.</LI><LI><B><A href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K2100010">pHybrid</A>.</B> A promoter that contains 5 binding sites for ER and 5 binding sites for ER alternatively spaced.
