    Integration of microfluidic devices has advanced considerably in quantitative biological research [1][2]. The timing of the fluid flow can be regulated with high accuracy because of the short response time of in-chip membrane valves (as quick as 1 ms)[1]. Moreover, with the aid of hydrogel, cells growing in microfluidics can be structured in three-dimensional geometries [1]. Therefore, cell culture performed in microfluidic devices could resemble in vivo conditions due to tight control of the microenvironment [2].  On the other hand, automation is another advantage of microfluidic technology. Instead of manual intervention, programmable fluid flows can automatically change chemical conditions of the culture environment. This feature would be particularly useful to examine dynamically changing systems [1]. The ability to precisely control fluid flows and chemical species as well as the automation of microfluidic technology are highly beneficial to future development of our project. Thus, the MIT iGEM team decided to collaborate with the Boston University Hardware iGEM team to develop a protocol for mammalian cell culture in microfluidic devices .

    The device had 2 sets of channels, one for fluid flow (labeled blue in the diagram), and another one for air exchange (labeled red in the diagram).

        After 24 hours, the channel was completely dried out. The images didn't show any cells inside the channel even though cells in the control culture dish grew normally (image not shown), which was seeded at the same time with as microfluidic device. Since we couldn't check for cells inside the device right after seeding, We couldn't narrow down the main reasons for <B>unsuccessful cell culturing</B> in the microfluidic device.

        Right after seeding, the cells were still in suspension; therefore, they all had spherical shape. After about 20 frames (190 minutes), they started to elongate and shifted out of focal plane. At the 26th frame (250 minutes after seeding), the cells were out of focus, which could <B>indicate adhesion</B> of the cells to the chamber's surface. The blue arrows point at cells showing <B>evidience of mitosis</B>, including appearance of two nuclei within a single cell and formation of the metaphase plate. Unfortunately, at the end of the video (after 350 minutes), the media within the chamber dried out, which has been a major problem for our experimental setup.

In the past Gateway reactions have used the ccdB death gene as a negative selection tool to pick bacterial cultures that have successfully taken up a copy of the desired plasmid.  However, due to a patent on ccdB and negative selection tools in Gateway, iGEM had to remove all ccdB-containing parts from their registry.  Our screening tool, pDEST mCherry, uses red fluorescence to pick successfully transformed cultures.  With this, we hope that iGEM will be able to distribute the parts that were discontinued, and mammalian work that relies on Gateway reactions will be significantly easier for future teams.

While we used the pDEST mCherry successfully in our lab, we needed to test the clarity of the protocol we had written, and whether they would work in other labs. </P><H2 style="color: #F20253; text-decoration:underline; font-family: Trebuchet MS;">Collaboration</H2><P>We were thrilled to work with the <A href="https://2016.igem.org/Team:Tufts">Tufts University iGEM team</A> in order to test our protocol, and our construct.  </P><H2 style="color: #F20253; text-decoration:underline; font-family: Trebuchet MS;">Results</H2><P> The ligation reaction was successful.  As can be seen on the plate that Tufts sent us, there are white colonies, and small red colonies. </P><H1 style="color:#FFFFFF; background-color:#F20253; -moz-border-radius: 15px; -webkit-border-radius: 15px; padding:15px; text-align: center; font-family: Trebuchet MS">Recombinases' sequences</H1><H2 style="color: #F20253; text-decoration:underline; font-family: Trebuchet MS;">Collaboration</H2><P>
    At the begining of the summer, we had a discussion with the <A href="https://2016.igem.org/Team:BostonU/Collaborations">BU Wetlab Team</A> to learn more about recombinases because some of their members and especially their graduate mentor - Ben Weinberg - had substantial experience working with recombinases. They specifically emphasized the issue of leaky expression of recombinase, resulting in high basal expression of output gene. Thus, during the conversation, we jotted down ideas for potential repressing systems, one of which were degradation tag and repressible promoters. However, the majority of their work with recombinase has been with tyrosine (Cre or FLP) family and done on E. coli. Thus, performing recombinase experiments in mammalian cell lines were unpredictable. Additionally, the BU Wetlab Team also helped us to obtain sequences for the recombinases and their equivalent recognition sites from Dr. Wilson Wong's lab.
