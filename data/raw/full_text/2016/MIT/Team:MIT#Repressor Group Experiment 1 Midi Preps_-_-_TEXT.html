output and location:
2mL tubes with DNA, in -20 freezer
Overnight liquid cultures (picking colonies)
Introduction
Overnight cultures are used to prepare miniprep DNA.
Materials
The plate from which you are picking colonies
15 ml round-bottom polystyrene tubes, one per culture
The ones with the snap caps, NOT conical tubes with screw caps
5 mL LB per culture
A container that can hold 5ml x the number of cultures
For a modest number of minipreps, a 50 ml conical tube works well.
For larger minipreps, use a sterile bottle (100 ml is frequently useful.)
Antibiotic stock, 1000X
Procedure
Materials Setup
Warm up the LB to at least room temperature (if it came from the fridge), but not warmer than 37°C
Label one round-bottom culture tube for each miniprep.  Use "NAME-1, NAME-2, ..."etc for the naming convention, where NAME is a shortened name of the plasmid (eg, "hEF1a:mKate").
Your impulse is to just use number, or initials and number, but trust me -- you will want to be able to identify this tube in three weeks when you've forgotten what you were doing.
Using a sterile pipette, transfer 5 ml of LB to the mixing container for each culture PLUS 5 ML.
Add antibiotic stock to a final concentration of 1X (1 µl stock for each 1 ml in the mixing container.)
Cap tightly and mix well.
Culture Setup
Using a sterile pipette, transfer 5 ml of LB+antibiotic to each round-bottom culture tube.
If you are making cultures with different antibiotics, take care that the right media goes in each tube.
Squirt ethanol on a pair of foreceps and wipe dry with a Kimwipe.
Use the foreceps to pick up a sterile 200µl pipette tip, scrape a colony off of the plate, and drop the pipette tip in the corresponding tube.
Repeat for each tube.
Transfer to an incubating shaker at 37°C and incubate 14-16 hours.
Don't over-grow too badly, or your yield will suffer.
If you need to grow longer, you can grow at 30°C instead for 20 hours.
