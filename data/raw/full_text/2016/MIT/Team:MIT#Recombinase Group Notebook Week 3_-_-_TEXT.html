Midiprep
Introduction
Purifying large amount of DNA to tranfect mammalian cells
Materials
Qiagen MidiPrep
Procedure
Overnight Culture 50mL (06/20/16)
Prepare the overnight culture 1 day before the midiprep
Choose 1 sample for each plasmid constructs from the diagnostic digest result
For each sample, preapre a 500mL breathable conical tube
Add 50mL media
5uL of antibiotic
10uL of culture from the miniprep
Incubate at 37C for 16-20 hours
Midiprep preparation (06/21/16)
Transfer 50mL overnight culture into 50mL Falcon tube
Centrifuge at max speed for 15 mins at 4C
Following the Qiagen midiprep protocol
