LR Reaction (4/1/2016, Liz, Wangui, Maya)
Introduction
An LR reaction insertd one or more parts in pENTR vectors into pDEST vector. Used to assemble transcriptional units from promoters and genes.
Materials
Promoter pENTER plasmif: L4-Promoter-R1
Working concentration: 5 fmol/ul
Gene pENTR plasmid: L1-Gene-L2
Working concentration: 5 fmol/ul
Destination plasmid: pDEST
Working concentration: 5 fmol/ul
200 ul PCR strip tubes, 1 tube per rxn ( 3 tubes)
5x LR Clonase II
Stored in ~5 ul liquots in the -80 in room 235. Don't remove an aliquot until you're ready to use it.
Proteinase K
Stored in ~5 ul liquots in the -80 in room 235. Don't remove an aliquot until you're ready to use it.

Table1
For each LR, label a 200 ul strip tube with your initials and tube number.
Into each tube, pipette:
-- 1 ul  of promoter pENTR
-- 1 ul of the gene pENTR
-- 2 ul of the pDEST
Retrieve an aliquot of LR Clonase from the -80
Bring an razor blade with you, you'll need to cut s tube from the strip tubes
Pulse the LR clonase tube in the microfuge to collect the clonase at the bottom
Add 1 ul of the LR clonase to each LR reaction.
Cap the tubes.
Flick them several times to mix.
Pulse-spin the tubes in the microfuge to collet the liquid at the bottom.
Incubate at room temperature for at least 12 hours and not more than 24 hours. (Started incubation at 4:30pm)
A popular strategy is to tape the tubes to the shelves over the bench, with your initials and date
16-24 Hours later: Proteinase K kill (Saturday 10am)
Retrieve a 5 aliquot of peoteinase K from the -80 freezer
That in your fingers, then pulse in the microfuge to collect at the bottom of the tube
Pipette 1 ul into each of the LR reations
Flick serveral times to mix
Pulse-spin the tubes in the microcentrifuge
Incubate at 37 degrees Celsius for 15 minutes, or room-temperature for an hour:
PAUSE POINT: You can store the reactions in the -20 indefinitely until the transformation
00:10:00
Proceed to transformation. Transform 2 ul. (Sunday 3pm)

Making SOC 路 Benchling
Making SOC
Introduction
SOC = SOB ("Super Optimal Broth") + Glucose (@40% w/v) Brian advised having SOB0 autoclaved first, and then adding glucose to SOB using a vacuum + filter with proper aseptic technique. If you end up making SOC, please write up detailed procedures, so other people can too :)
Materials
SOB
In coldroom or on bench
40% Glucose
Above bench or ask Brian
Procedure
Dilute 40% glucose to 2% using SOB (1:20)
Use a sterile bottle (same kind that 40% glucose in)
This can be done at the bench
