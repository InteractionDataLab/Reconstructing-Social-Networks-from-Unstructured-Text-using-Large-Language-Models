TEAM
Human Practices
We submitted a collection of well-characterized mammalian parts to the registry
We documented common synthetic biology protocols and created a website to help visualize these steps
We changed our circuit design through many iterations based on meetings with experts
including Linda Griffith, Asgi Fazleabas, Ron Weiss, and others
We shared our work with a variety of audiences, from young children and their parents to experienced
industry scientists, to educate the public about both synthetic biology and endometriosis
