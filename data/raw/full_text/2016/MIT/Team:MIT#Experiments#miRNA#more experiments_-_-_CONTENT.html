Program Used:<A href="http://bpteague.github.io/cytoflow/">CytoFlo</A> by <A href="https://2016.igem.org/Team:MIT/Team"> Brian Teague </A><P> Flow cytometry occurs 48 hours after transfection, and if applicable, 24 hours after induction of a small molecule (such as the hormone estrogen). After the data is collected, anaylsis of the flow cytometry data commences.
1) After inputting each unique sample with their respective variables, we observe the total cell population using forward scatter height vs. width. The upper right of the graph represents pieces that are most likely cell aggregates and the lower left represents debris and dead cells. The middle oval is the desired cell population we wish the analyze. 
2)Only looking at the experimental samples, we look at a graph with the transfection marker vs. cell count. The threshold of transfection is set in the dip between the untransfected cell population and the hump of known transfected cell. From now on, we will only be analyzing the population above this threshold, the transfected cells.
3)The next step is when the cell population is divided into specific bins. This distinguishes sections of the cell population by different number of copies of the transfection marker taken up. To avoid the strange behavior seen at low and high transfection marker copy number, we might decide to only analyze the middle bin(s).
4)After deciding the bins to look at, we apply the variables we specified in the very beginning. For example, we can look at the varying red fluorescence output due to different amounts of siRNA induction, as seen in our first experiment.

As described above, flow cytometry analysis was carried out in those four steps listed. Before experimental variables were applied, it was decided to only analyze bins 14-19 due to their uniform behavior (Figure 2).

Because the resulting trend of endogenous miRNA-451a in tHESC had a slope ~ 1, it is concluded that the miRNA activity of 451a is very minimal and therefore could be treated with siRNA without fear of influence from endogenous miRNAs.

Before finalizing the analysis, it was decided that bins 14-19 were most representative of the data.

When increasing siRNA-451a 0 to 1 nM, there is a 10 fold repression of red fluorescence. Saturation occurs at approximately 10 nM. More experiments would need to be done to understand the responsiveness between 0 to 1 nM.  </P><H1 style="color:#ffffff; background-color:#FF9733; -moz-border-radius: 15px; -webkit-border-radius: 15px; padding:15px; text-align: center"> miRNA Profile of tHESC </H1><H2 style="color:#000000;text-decoration:underline"> Purpose </H2><P> To confirm that tHESC under varying conditions (1nm estrodial and no estrodial) would have distinct miRNA profiles. </P><H2 style="color:#000000;text-decoration:underline"> Set Up </H2><P>Tert-immortalized human endometrial stromal cells were transfected with our eight candidate miRNA sensors (see below).
