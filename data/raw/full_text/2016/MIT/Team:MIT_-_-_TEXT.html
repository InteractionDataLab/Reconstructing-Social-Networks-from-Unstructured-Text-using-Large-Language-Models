TEAM
Read more about endometriosis and our project design
We created new, synthetic promoters to respond to this disease marker
We characterized microRNA profiles in model cells under varying conditions
We characterized a serine integrase, TP901, that could give a genetic circuit memory across a cycle
Read about a summary of our results and how our sensors interact logically after transfection of
4 to 5-unit genetic circuits into model cell cultures
Read about how we worked with other iGEM teams throughout our project
Read more about the future of our work through circuit design and clinical application
