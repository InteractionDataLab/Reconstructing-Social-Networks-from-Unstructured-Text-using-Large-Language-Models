Diagnosis and Future Implications
Future Work & Design
There is vast, untapped potential for mammalian synthetic biology in medicine;
our project is only one example of that. Having characterized a toolkit of mammalian parts
that could be applied to a diagnostic circuit for endometriosis, we designed a full circuit
and tested its logic step-by-step in both hormone phases and disease vs. healthy state. We've
also considered an ideal clinical situation, which we see as a possibility after more thorough
testing of our work, and finally a broader view on the applications of mammalian synbio in medicine.
