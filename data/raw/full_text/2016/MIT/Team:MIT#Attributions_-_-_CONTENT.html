This has been a great experience and we couldn't have done it without help! </P><U><B><H2>Promoter Engineering Subgroup Attributions</H2></B></U><P>All estrogen and progesterone sensing constructs were designed and created by the members of our subgroup. Entry vectors for constitutive promoters (hEF1a), repressors (TAL14, BM3R1,TAL21), fluorescent genes (eYFP, BFP, etc.), and activators were provided by the Weiss Lab. All experiments on our promoters were performed by members of our subgroup and conceived by us the students. The student on our team who proposed the  minCMV architecture with upstream binding sites for the ER and PR was inspired by a class he had taken with Prof. Ron Weiss, Biological Circuit Engineering Laboratory, where he had done some basic promoter engineering work in yeast. The cells we sought to test our promoters with (MCF7, ISH, tHESC) were not available in our host lab (the Weiss Lab), so we initiated a collaboration with the Grifith Lab at MIT, affiliated with the Center for Gynepathology Research. Christi Cook and Linda Stockdale of the Griffith Lab provided us with the cells, as well as best practices for culturing and stimulating them. Prof. Linda Griffith and Prof. Ron Weiss advised us during lab meetings where we would present our data. Postdoc Brian Teague of the Weiss Lab was our direct supervisor in case we ran into any difficulties with our labwork; he also helped us initially optimize the transfection of tHESC using electroporation when we ran into difficulties with cationic lipid transfection.</P><U><B><H2>miRNA Sensing Subgroup Attributions</H2></B></U><P>All experiments were performed by members of our subgroup and conceived by us the students.
