To tackle the size of this project, we organized our team into three sub-groups,
each addressing a synthetic biological tool that could assist in the diagnosing of
endometriosis. Then we combined our efforts into a proof of concept.
We also worked with other teams in the spirit of iGEM collaboration to test our
projects in new environments.
Synthetic mammalian promoters designed with repeating protein binding sequences demonstrated
significant increase in reporter activity when induced with estrogen or progesterone in hormone-sensitive cell lines.
Observed change in microRNA activity in an endometrial cell line under different conditions
and characterized microRNA target site sensitivity.
Serine recombinase TP901 successfully activates flipped EYFP when the upstream promoter is induced
and L7Ae/k-turn, RNA-based gene repressing system, reduces basal expression of the recombinase.

4 to 5-unit genetic circuits into model cell cultures
