Goal: Transform E. Coli cells with pEXP_hef1a:rtTA, pEXP_TRE:TALER14, pEXP_Tal14:meYFP
What we Did: Followed protocol
Results:
●
First E. Coli transformation was done on Sunday, April 3nd, but very few colonies grew on any of the plates.
●
The transformations were done again by Wangui on April 4rd  and recieved the same results.
●
It was concluded that the comptetent E. Coli cells used were defective and a commercial bath of E. Coli cells were used for today's transformations.

Transformation of E. coli (4/10/2016, Liz, Kathryn, Wangui)
Introduction
Transformation is the process of inducing chemically competent E. coli to take up
Materials
Dry bath, set to 42°C
Fill the wells in the dry bath block 1/2 full with DI water.
Ice bucket, with ice
For thawing competent cells.
DNA to transform
Could be an assembly reaction (LR, Golden Gate, etc) or a miniprepped plasmid.
If you removed it from the freezer, make sure it's entirely thawed  out.
pUC19 Transformation Control, 1 pg/µl
The pUC19 control will tell you how efficient your transformations were.
SOC growth media, at room temperature
Check to make sure it's clear and NOT CLOUDY.
Antibiotic plates, one per transformation, plus 1 Amp plate for the pUC19 control
Make sure the plates you use match the resistance cassette of the plasmid!
Competent E. coli, one tube per transformation + one for the pUC19 control
These live in the -80 in 235.
Thaw on ice 3-4 minutes.
A timer, set for 30 seconds.
Procedure
Setup
Make sure the dry bath is set to 42°C and the wells in the block are 1/2 full of DI water
Remove selection plates from the refrigerator.  Double-check that they match the selection marker on your plasmid, then place them in the 37° incubator.
Retrieve the DNA to transform.
If frozen: thaw, completely, flick a few times to mix, then pulse down in the microfuge.
Fill an ice bucket with ice.  Retrieve one tube of competent E. coli per transformation from the -80 and thaw on ice, 3-4 minutes.

Transformation
Add 2 µl DNA from each reaction to a tube of competent cells.
Immediately after adding the DNA to each tube, stir the cells a few times with the pipette tip.
Add 1 µl of the pUC19 transformation control to the positive control tube.
Incubate on ice for 30 minutes.
00:30:00
Heat shock the cells for exactly 30 seconds in the 42° heat block. (Yes, set a timer.)
00:00:30
Place back on ice for 2 minutes.
00:02:00
Add 250 µl SOC to each tube.
Tape the tubes to the platform of a shaker at 37°C and shake at 270 RPM for 60 minutes.
01:00:00
Plating
Label the selection plates using the labels you recorded a bove.
Shake ~10 plating beads onto each plate.
Pipette 100 µl of each transformation onto the corresponding plates.
Cover the plates and shake the beads around to spread the cells out.
Dispose of the beads by tapping them into the waste container.
Incubate the plates upside down overnight in the 37° incubator.
Don't incubate for more than 18-24 hours.
Compute transformation efficiency (Wednesday, April 10th)
Count the colonies on your positive transformation plate.
If there are many many colonies, then hooray!  You had a great transformation.  Just estimate.
Divide the number of colonies by the fraction of the transformation you plated.
So, if you resuspended your transformation in a total volume of 300 ul, then plated 100 ul, multiply the number of colonies by 3.
Transformation efficiency is expressed in colonies per microgram pUC19.  Multiply the number of colonies by the appropriate conversion factor.
So if you transformed 1 picogram of pUC19 DNA, multiply by 106.
Record your transformation efficiency in your (daily) lab notebook.

Goal and Purpose: Prepare liquid cultures for mini-prep
What We Did: Followed protocol
Results: Left cultures in 37 degree Celsius shaker. When cultures were taken out, Brian spun down the cultures and sotred them in the -80 degree Celsius. Thank you, Brian!
Overnight liquid cultures (4/14/2016 Maya, Liz, Kathryn)
Introduction
Overnight cultures are used to prepare miniprep DNA.
Materials
The plate from which you are picking colonies
15 ml round-bottom polystyrene tubes, one per culture
The ones with the snap caps, NOT conical tubes with screw caps
5 mL LB per culture
A container that can hold 5ml x the number of cultures
For a modest number of minipreps, a 50 ml conical tube works well.
For larger minipreps, use a sterile bottle (100 ml is frequently useful.)
Antibiotic stock, 1000X
Procedure
Materials Setup
Warm up the LB to at least room temperature (if it came from the fridge), but not warmer than 37°C
Label one round-bottom culture tube for each miniprep.  Use "NAME-1, NAME-2, ..."etc for the naming convention, where NAME is a shortened name of the plasmid (eg, "hEF1a:mKate").
Your impulse is to just use number, or initials and number, but trust me -- you will want to be able to identify this tube in three weeks when you've forgotten what you were doing.

Table1
Using a sterile pipette, transfer 5 ml of LB to the mixing container for each culture PLUS 5 ML.
Add antibiotic stock to a final concentration of 1X (1 µl stock for each 1 ml in the mixing container.)
Cap tightly and mix well.
Culture Setup
Using a sterile pipette, transfer 5 ml of LB+antibiotic to each round-bottom culture tube.
If you are making cultures with different antibiotics, take care that the right media goes in each tube.
Squirt ethanol on a pair of foreceps and wipe dry with a Kimwipe.
Use the foreceps to pick up a sterile 200µl pipette tip, scrape a colony off of the plate, and drop the pipette tip in the corresponding tube.
Repeat for each tube.
Transfer to an incubating shaker at 37°C and incubate 14-16 hours.
Don't over-grow too badly, or your yield will suffer.
If you need to grow longer, you can grow at 30°C instead for 20 hours.

-----Golden Gate: Plate only 10 ul of the outgrowth in a 200 ul puddle of water, or you will get a lawn of colonies.
Cover the plates and shake the beads around to spread the cells out.
