Through our parts characterization experiments, we have demonstrated the functionality of both our hormone sensing and miRNA sensing techniques in a cell line that very closely resembles human endometrial stromal tissue, tHESC. When we probed this cell line for miRNA levels using miRNA sensors, we were able to prove our capability of sensing changes in miRNA levels in response to hormones in this cell line. By confirming that the L7Ae/k-turn system can regulate the expression of a recombinase under the <A href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K2100021">EGSH promoter</A>, we have shown that we can create the type of hormone-inducible biological ‘latch’ system we had hoped. Our collaboration with the Boston University Hardware Team has verified our ability to culture mammalian cells in a microfluidic device, which is the platform we envision for the clinical application of the functional cascade of the individual components we have characterized. Having done all of this, we tested combinations of parts to observe their combined functionality in model cells.

In order to create emergent functions and logic structure from our individuals parts and devices, we cascaded them together in larger 4 to 5 transcriptional unit circuits. We created both estrogen inducible promoter - repressor cascades in order to create &quot;estrogen low&quot; sensing logic, as well as estrogen inducible promoter - recombinase cascades in order to create &quot;estrogen high&quot; latches. Our attempts with experimenting with these cascades and getting them to function as expected <B>met with only limited success</B>. Some of this can be attributed to natural limitations encountered with creating larger genetic circuits, such as metabolic costs.</P><CENTER><H1 style="color:#FFFFFF; background-color:#F20253;; -moz-border-radius: 15px; -webkit-border-radius: 15px; padding:15px; text-align: center; font-family: Trebuchet MS"> Estrogen Sensitive Promoters in Repressor Cascades</H1></CENTER>

We began testing how our estrogen responsive promoters behave in larger genetic circuits by first testing estrogen sensitive promoter - repressor cascades. We considered two repressors, <A href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K2100018">BM3R1</A> and <A href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K2100016">TAL14</A>.

Our estrogen inducible promoter - repressor cascades enable &quot;estrogen low&quot; sensing logic. When estrogen levels in the cell are low, then almost no repressor is made and eYFP is produced.

This is probably an artifact of poor transfection in the ISH cell line for this experiment (less than 2 percent transfected after cationic lipid transfection), which leads to erratic jumps in the data after binning by constitutive marker. In the future, we may want to try other modes of transfection for ISH to improve the transfection efficiency. </P><P><I>Results from pERE#n - repressor cascades pairing <A href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K2100000">pERE3</A>, <A href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K2100001">pERE5</A>, <A href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K2100002">pERE6</A> and <A href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K2100016">TAL14</A>, <A href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K2100018">BM3R1</A> transfected into MCF7.

We hypothesized that we were unable to resolve a clear fold difference in our pERE#n - repressor cascades transfected into ISH because of the limited functionality of our promoters in the ISH cell line. So, we proceeded to transfect our cells into the MCF7 cell line where we had observed up to a 11 fold difference in the activity of some of our promoters.

Our estrogen inducible promoter - recombinase cascades behave like latches detecting if estrogen levels had ever reached a &quot;high&quot; state. When estrogen levels in the cell are high, then recombinases are produced which flip the eYFP gene.
