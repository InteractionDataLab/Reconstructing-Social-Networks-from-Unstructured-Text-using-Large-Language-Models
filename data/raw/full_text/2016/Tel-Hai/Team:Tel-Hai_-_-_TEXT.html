iGEM Tel-Hai 2016
Where is the magic happening?
Tel-Hai and MIGAL's labs located in northen Israel
Who are we?
Group of dedicated students and researchers from the fields of biotechnology and biochemistry
What is our goal?
Correcting the most prevalent mutation in the CFTR protein, causing Cystic Fibrosis, in somatic cells
Why did we choose Cystic Fibrosis?
This is a "simple" missense mutation, leading to the loss of single amino acid, causing Cystic Fibrosis - a largely researched lethal genetic disease, found in every ethnic group world-wide.
Why now of all times?
Only recently has genome editing become an affordable and practical tool for all researchers, to maximize efficiency in correcting diseases causing mutations.
How can we do it?
Utilizing the Cholera toxin's non-toxic B Sub-unit as a delivery system for a plasmid containing a CRISPR/Cas9 apparatus, so as to specifically correct the defected DNA fragment with minimal collateral damage.
