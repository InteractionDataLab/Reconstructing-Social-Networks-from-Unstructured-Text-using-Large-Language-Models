This year, our group organized the event in the Northern Galilee along with the MIGAL research center, where children from the ages 4-18 participated in activities from all different fields, ranging from ice cream made of liquid nitrogen, to extracting DNA from plants. The beauty of physics, chemistry and biology were displayed and performed in creative ways and there were shows and activities for people of all ages. There was collaboration with the iGEM groups from the Technion institute and Danziger high-school likewise, and we were thrilled that they joined us at this exciting event, in which more than 3,000 curious children and adults participated.</P><H4>Lecture at the Pub</H4><P>From the Researcher’s Night, we continued and aimed to reach an even larger crowd, and planned an event throughout which Professor Rachel Amir from the MIGAL Institute came to lecture to people about the stereotypes regarding genetic engineering, what it means today, and how it affects our lives. The heated subject was discussed in a homey, comfortable environment, and the benefits and fears were eloquently addressed.</P><H4>Youth Excellence Program</H4><P>We see it as a privilege to teach and expose teens from Kiryat Shmona to the fields of Biotechnology, entrepreneurship and iGEM. Hence, we met with the youth excellence program group of the Tel-Hai College, and exposed them to the new and fascinating world of synthetic biotechnology.</P><H4>Open Day at the Tel-Hai College</H4><P>While applicants came to our college, we explained to applicants interested in the fields of science about the idea of iGEM and synthetic biology and what they can do in the near future to be part of it. Likewise, we raised awareness about the CF disease,our collaboration with the Israeli Cystic Fibrosis Foundation and our statewide campaign.</P><H4>T.V Show “Outside of the Bubble”</H4><P>This television show gives people from the Periphery the genuine opportunity to talk about and share their problems caused by the lack of funding and facilities in those areas.</P><P>One of our team members was interviewed and questioned about genetic engineering and the iGEM competition, promoting our team and the Northern District likewise.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
