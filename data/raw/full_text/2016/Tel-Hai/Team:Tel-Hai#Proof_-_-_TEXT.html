Demonstrating A Proof of Concept
In order to explain our proof of concept, it's necessary to remind ourselves the main project goal: "Development of a novel and efficient delivery-system for gene editing technology in Cystic Fibrosis"
Work Plan:
BBa_K2061005 consist: B-subunit of the E. coli Heat-Labile Toxin (LTB), linker and short viral DNA binding domain (DBD) sequences, expression via pSB1C3 plasmid in E. coli.
Isolation of the new chimeric protein: LTB + DBD (LTBD).
LTBD binding to GFP plasmid.
LTBD + plasmid enter the cell when introduced to NCI-H1650 (human lung epithelial cells expressing ganglioside receptors on their plasma membrane).
* LTBD complex was pre incubated with and plasmid tagged with Hoechst for identification.
Our Proof of Concept Goals:
LTBD binding, delivery and expression of GFP plasmid to NCI-H1650:
LTBD bind GFP plasmid DNA
LTBD bind to ganglioside receptor
LTBD + GFP plasmid enter the cell via endocytosis
Plasmid go to the nucleus
GFP gene expression
Results:
LTBD stop DNA migration by binding to the plasmid.
LTBD with marked with green FITC attaching to cell membrane
LTBD in cell's cytosol
DNA in the nucleus
* We were unable to achieve the 5th goal due lack of time.
We want to thank Dr. Moshik Kutner-Cohen and Dr. Niv Bachnoff for guiding us to achieve all above.
