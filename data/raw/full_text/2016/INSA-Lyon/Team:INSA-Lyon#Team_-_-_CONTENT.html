I discovered the iGEM competition in 2013 while I was providing support for the European Jamboree organization. Instantaneously, I was attracted by the scientific aspects of the concept as well as the human ones. Thus, I joined the 2016 iGEM team in order to learn how to elaborate a project from the subject's definition to the experiences and the presentation of the results. During the summer, I specifically worked on fluorescence revelation, streptavidin part design and characterization, cloning experiments and final parts characterization tests. During my leisure time, I love traveling and practicing sports like dance.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="col-md-3 col-sm-6 col-xs-12"><DIV class="single-team-member"><DIV class="team-member-name"><H3>Julien Orlans</H3><SPAN>INSA</SPAN></DIV><P>I am a fifth year student in Biochemistry and Biotechnologies at INSA Lyon and in Bioinformatics at the University Claude Bernard Lyon 1. Since I heard about synthetic biology and all its possibilities, I wanted to take part in a project from scratch and build a complete system. That’s why I joined the iGEM team INSA Lyon 2016 in order to realize this ambition. During this summer, I worked on the molecular modelling of the 3D structures of our different aptamers and on the homology modelling of our protein of interest.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="col-md-3 col-sm-6 col-xs-12"><DIV class="single-team-member"><DIV class="team-member-name"><H3>Louis Becquey</H3><SPAN>INSA</SPAN></DIV><P>4th year student in biosciences, and now ported on bio-informatics and mathematical modelling, I have heard about the iGEM several times last years and always wanted to join a team.

The tool we built to compute the most probable aptamer structures was one of the first great bio-informatics project I contributed to. This iGEM contest experience was therefore a good training exercise of teamwork and software development.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-md-3 col-md-offset-2 col-sm-6 col-xs-12"><DIV class="single-team-member"><DIV class="team-member-name"><H3>Gianina Ungurean</H3><SPAN>INSA</SPAN></DIV><P>I am a fifth year student in the department of Biochemistry and Biotechnologies at INSA Lyon.

Apart working on molecular cloning, I was also able to use my passion for visual arts in the benefit on the project.

I had the chance to follow the project from the early brainstorming to the wiki redaction,  in many domains ( interlab, human practice, parts characterization, revelation system, microfluidics assay) as an helper. I was really interested in studying the impacts of synthetic biology in the society and the human issues. Taking part in a such project was an exciting experience in the lab and was also a good occasion to work with people from other disciplines.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="col-md-3 col-sm-6 col-xs-12"><DIV class="single-team-member"><DIV class="team-member-name"><H3>Thomas Sabate</H3><SPAN>ENS</SPAN></DIV><P>I am a student in the first year of my master's degree in Biosciences at the École Normale Supérieure of Lyon. I decided to join the INSA's Lyon team to discover the engineering way of thinking in biology while my university has a much more fundamental approach. iGEM was a perfect manner to build collectively a whole project started from scratch in synthetic biology. I worked in the wet lab on the development and optimization of the device and helped to characterize Aptamer-proteins interaction. In the future, I would like to work on modeling quantitatively the stochasticity of gene regulation..</P></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-md-3 col-md-offset-3 col-sm-6 col-xs-12"><DIV class="single-team-member"><DIV class="team-member-name"><H3>Jeanne Talonneau</H3><SPAN>ENS</SPAN></DIV><P>Product designer, I graduated from the ESAA La Martinière Diderot in Lyon with the Higher Diploma in Applied Arts (DSAA).

Since 2011, I have participated as a student, an advisor, a Regional Jamboree staff member, a Giant Jamboree volunteer and finally as an instructor. After graduating in 2013, I traveled across the planet for a 2-year mission within the Office for Science and Technology at the Embassy of France in the US where I was in charge of fostering partnerships between French and American labs in the field of life sciences. In late 2015, I came back to Lyon to further develop former iGEM projects and provide support to our budding iGEMers.
