                                      Thanks to the plate specifications estimate the amount of biotin it can link. Then put a two fold excess of RC and A2 in 100 µL PBS in each well, according to your experiment map. Don’t forget control wells which may be filled with PBS.
                                      
                                      Let the mixture incubate 1 h at 30°C. Then wash the wells three times with the binding buffer. Your plate is ready.
                                      
                                      In each well pour 20 µL of beads and 70 or 80 µL of binding buffer. Optionally add 10 µL Thrombin according to your experimental plan. The total volume in each well must be 100 µL.
                                      
                                      Incubate this mixture on a rotating plate for 30 min at room temperature, then wash the wells with PBS.
                                      
                                      Measure the OD600 of each wells. Because beads tend to be unequally spread, you must do at least triplicates. Don’t forget your control filled up with PBS.

                              Computer-aided design in biology helps increasing the efficiency of biological manipulation and experimentation while easing the process of design and optimization. For our project we have used Serial Cloner, a free software. This software offers all the tools to manipulate and analyze DNA sequences (identification of restriction sites in a DNA sequence, simulation of DNA transcription to RNA and translation to protein, generating the inverse and/or complementary sequence, comparing two sequences together, etc.).

The use of these three solvents in parallel allows us to test the difference in fluorescence between an isotonic medium (NaCl, PBS) or a non-isotonic one (distilled water). In a 96 well plate, 25 µL of whole blood or serum were added to 25 µL of fluorescein in solution. Four calibration ranges assays were set:

The emitted fluorescence was measured using the plate reader Chameleon (Multilabel reader flat Chameleon - Hidex, No. 2,060,003 series SCIENCETEC) on 3 different times t = 0 min t = 10 min and t = 20 min in order to observe the kinetic of fluorescence.

Blank corresponds to a solution of distilled water only. The solutions were placed into spectrophotometer 1 mL cuves and the emitted fluorescence was visualized using a smartphone with a combination of two filters. The first filter which has the transmitted wavelength corresponding to the maximum emission of fluorescein (512 nm), is positioned on the lens of the camera. The second filter, which has the transmitted wavelength corresponding to the absorption maximum of fluorescein (494 nm), is fixed on the flash. The picture is then taken under different conditions: combination of two filters, the filter on the single flash, the filter on the lens only and without any filter.
