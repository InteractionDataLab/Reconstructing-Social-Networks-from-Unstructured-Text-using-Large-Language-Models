Mathilde Gonthier
INSA
I am a fifth year student in Biochemistry and Biotechnologies at INSA Lyon. I discovered the iGEM competition in 2013 while I was providing support for the European Jamboree organization.
Instantaneously, I was attracted by the scientific aspects of the concept as well as the human ones. Thus, I joined the 2016 iGEM team in order to learn how to elaborate a project from the subject's definition to the experiences and the presentation of the results. During the summer, I specifically worked on fluorescence revelation, streptavidin part design and characterization, cloning experiments and final parts characterization tests. During my leisure time, I love traveling and practicing sports like dance.
Julien Orlans
INSA
I am a fifth year student in Biochemistry and Biotechnologies at INSA Lyon and in Bioinformatics at the University Claude Bernard Lyon 1. Since I heard about synthetic biology and all its possibilities, I wanted to take part in a project from scratch and build a complete system. That’s why I joined the iGEM team INSA Lyon 2016 in order to realize this ambition. During this summer, I worked on the molecular modelling of the 3D structures of our different aptamers and on the homology modelling of our protein of interest.
Louis Becquey
INSA
4th year student in biosciences, and now ported on bio-informatics and mathematical modelling, I have heard about the iGEM several times last years and always wanted to join a team. This year, I tried ! I am glad to help the team making real discoveries after a modelling work and numerical calculations. The tool we built to compute the most probable aptamer structures was one of the first great bio-informatics project I contributed to. This iGEM contest experience was therefore a good training exercise of teamwork and software development.
Gianina Ungurean
INSA
I am a fifth year student in the department of Biochemistry and Biotechnologies at INSA Lyon. I am a person who enjoys challenges and a place in my university iGEM team fits me. Having to build a project from scratch motivated me and indeed, in the end this project turned out to be a very enriching experience. Apart working on molecular cloning, I was also able to use my passion for visual arts in the benefit on the project. I worked on the molecular animation and I was also in charge with the Communication and Publicity.
Delphine Bourgeon
INSA
Student in fourth year in Biochemistry and Biotechnologies at INSA Lyon, I am very interested in working as a team and in carrying out a project from the beginning to the end. I especially appreciate the way we can mix both sciences and humanities in one project. Consequently, I worked on the Human practices and I took part in the achievement of the InterLab study.
Margaux Poulalier-Delavelle
INSA
I am a fourth year student in Biochemistry and Biotechnologies at INSA Lyon. Since I discovered it, I am a real synthetic biology enthusiast and naturally joined this year iGEM team. Working as a team, building and participating in this project was really fulfilling and enriching. Moreover I am really interested in the human aspect of our project and the improvement it can bring to our society, so I took part in the human practices in addition to the InterLab study.
Mathieu Borel
INSA
I am a fifth year student at the INSA Lyon and Lyon Science University where I am studying biochemistry. I have always been amazed by synthetic biology's possibilities and achievements. So two years ago I joined the IA2C, which is the student association taking care of the iGEM organization. Ever since I started to work on synthetic biology as a hobby. The iGEM 2016 is the pinnacle of this work. In the future I hope to get a science PhD, and may be work in the synthetic biology field !
Paul Zanoni
INSA
I am a fourth year student in Biochemistry and Biotechnologies at the INSA of Lyon. On the beginning of last year, I was very curious to explore the world of the synthetic biology and to take part in a team research project. Joining the INSA Lyon iGEM team was the good choice. I had the chance to follow the project from the early brainstorming to the wiki redaction,  in many domains ( interlab, human practice, parts characterization, revelation system, microfluidics assay) as an helper. I was really interested in studying the impacts of synthetic biology in the society and the human issues. Taking part in a such project was an exciting experience in the lab and was also a good occasion to work with people from other disciplines.
Thomas Sabate
ENS
I am a student in the first year of my master's degree in Biosciences at the École Normale Supérieure of Lyon. I decided to join the INSA's Lyon team to discover the engineering way of thinking in biology while my university has a much more fundamental approach. iGEM was a perfect manner to build collectively a whole project started from scratch in synthetic biology. I worked in the wet lab on the development and optimization of the device and helped to characterize Aptamer-proteins interaction. In the future, I would like to work on modeling quantitatively the stochasticity of gene regulation..
Jeanne Talonneau
ENS
Product designer, I graduated from the ESAA La Martinière Diderot in Lyon with the Higher Diploma in Applied Arts (DSAA). After my scientific Baccalaureate, I followed an upgrading course in applied arts with MANAA (Mise A Niveau en Arts Appliqués) in Quimper and then studied Product Design in Brest. Currently, I am doing a final master study in Design Research at ENS Cachan / ENSCI Les Ateliers / Telecom ParisTech in Paris, Science Course, Innovation, Design. I also had the opportunity to do a semester at the CEA of Grenoble in the innovation cluster and now I wish to orient my career towards R&D.
Mickaël HUBERT
INSA
I am currently studying in the Telecommunications and Networks Department at INSA Lyon. I have had a growing passion in I.T since childhood, that is why, I gladly accepted to help the team on the project, focusing on the Wiki part. The iGEM project allowed me to enhance my skills in WEB programmation and broaden my knowledge across fields which I was not familiar with.

Damien Jacques
INSA
I am a mechanical design and production teacher at INSA Lyon. I am specially interested in 3D Printers, that is the reason why I was asked to participate to the iGEM project. I agreed with pleasure because I like working with students on such interdisciplinary projects. I think it is important that students know 3D printers technologies because 3D Printers will provide many opportunities in several domains in the next 10 or 20 years and the iGEM project is an example for this. Otherwise I like to play tennis, to ski and to walk in mountain, and also to cook french food with my family and my friends !
Pedro Da Silva
INSA
Associate professor at INSA de LYON, I'm a structural biologist. I think that iGEM is an exciting way to introduce research and team work to students.
