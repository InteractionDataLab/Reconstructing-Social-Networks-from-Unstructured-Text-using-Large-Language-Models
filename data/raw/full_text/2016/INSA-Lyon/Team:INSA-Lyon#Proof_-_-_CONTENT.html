                                    This experiment allows to measure the affinity of an aptamer with its target.

                                The first system we worked on was the fluorescence detection system.
                            </P><H3 class="title">Principle</H3><P>
                                The aptamer is bounded to a fluorescent group (FITC). To temporarily switch off the fluorescence, we fixed on its reverse-complement a quencher molecule, that quenches
                                the fluorescence by Fluorescent Resonnance Energetic Transfert.
                                When the ATP comes, as its affinity for the aptamer is higher, he removes the quencher to link the aptamer, that becomes fluorescent.</P><P>
                                To detect the fluorescence, we use the smartphone-with-filters technique: put a blue filter on your flash, a green one on your camera, and take a picture of your test.
                                The FITC fluorescence should appear (see our <A href="https://igem.org/Team:INSA-Lyon/Results">Results page</A>).

                                The aptamer is decorated with fluorescein thanks to crosslinking in presence of FITC.
                                This labelling allows further detection of the aptamer/target complex. The aptamer used here is known as ATP aptamer (DOI: 10.1021/la060961c)
                                The mix was analyzed on a PAGE gel stained with ethidium bromide (red color).

                                The DNA was blotted on nitrocellulose using capillary transfer. To quench the fluorescence we used quencher oligos. They are reverse complement fragments of 6 nucleotides of the aptamer labelled with a DABCYL molecule at their 3’ end.
                                These quencher oligos were hybridized in situ by incubating the membrane in hybridization buffer, we used the same buffer as for Southern blots. After washing the quencher excess, increasing amount of ATP gradient was applied on each lane of the nitrocellulose membrane.

                                    Cellulose shows no auto-fluorescence (bar 1). A small fraction of streptavidin can link the cellulose spontaneously (bar 2). Both engineered streptavidin-CBDs
                                    allow the formation of complexes with the fluorescent reporter system and cellulose that can be detected by measuring the green fluorescence, as shown in figure 9 (bars 3 and 4).

                                In parallel to this biology work a casing was created to host our smart paper. The goal was to design something clear and intuitive.
                                We printed this device in 3D and made <A href="https://2016.igem.org/Team:INSA-Lyon/Results#fluidics">fluidic tests</A>.
                                After a few attempts we achieved a good bead diffusion on the paper strips inserted inside the device.
                                If you want to know more, you’re invited to see the <A href="https://2016.igem.org/Team:INSA-Lyon/Design">design page</A>.
