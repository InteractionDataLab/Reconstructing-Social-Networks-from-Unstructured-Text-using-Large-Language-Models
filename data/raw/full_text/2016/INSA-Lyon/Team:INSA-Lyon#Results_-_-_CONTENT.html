                                Here are some of our first experiment results that guided us through our development, and finally, our results with sexually transmitted infections vectors.

                                    In this experience, we used some modified aptamers. They were functionalized with a FITC, so they were fluorescent.
                                    Fluorescence was stopped by the reverse-complement of the aptamer,
                                    which was holding a quencher: a molecule that switches off the fluorescence by the
                                    Fluorescent Resonnance Energy Transfert (FRET) phenomenon.
                                </P><P>
                                    We studied how the ability of ATP to chase the quencher away. As the target (ATP) and the quencher are in competition to bind the aptamer,
                                    the emitted fluorescence is a good estimation of the proportion of aptamers that have linked an ATP.

                                    This is not particularly efficient. We think that the quenching oligo is disturbing the aptamer, lowering its sensitivity.

                                    The next step was to try this on paper.

                                    In this experience we wanted first to test what is the impact of non-isotonic solvents on the emitted fluorescence. 
                                    We obtained no significant differences of fluorescence emissions between assays when me mixed blood with PBS buffer or with NaCl.
                                    Although, we tried to compare the fluorescence emissions between blood and plasma. The results were more interesting.
                                </P><P>
                                    Student statistical tests were performed for each concentration of fluorescein. It was concluded that blood filtration to remove especially red blood cells which could mask the
                                    fluorescence is proven to be very important: the fluorescence emitted is between 2 and 11 times larger in the case of serum compared to whole blood.

                                    As our device is meant to be used at home, we wanted a revelation method that does not imply the use of a UV lamp.
                                    Inspired by the work of the 2015 iGEM Bielefeld-CeBiTec team on sfGFP (another fluorescent molecule which emission wavelengths and absorption are
                                    relatively close to those of fluorescein), we decided to test whether a revelation with light filters on the flash and camera of our smartphone would work.
                                    Images taken with the smartphone equipped with various combinations of filters revealed that the filter on the flash was necessary
                                    to foresee a fluorescence (see below). Moreover, adding a filter to the lens increases the detection sensitivity.
                                    Also, it turned out that the sample of fluorescein concentration was a very important factor.
                                    Above a certain threshold of the concentration, fluorescence is quenched.

                                    We designed paper strips that could handle our biological system.
                                    These paper strips contained a filtration pad in glass fiber, a nitrocellulose strip, and an adsorption pad in cellulose.
                                </P><FIGURE class="figure"><FIGCAPTION class="figcaption"><STRONG>Fig 4.</STRONG></FIGCAPTION></FIGURE><P>
                                    The filtration pad was here to prevent erythrocytes from migrating on the paper strip. It worked, after migration the nitrocellulose remained white and the results could be read. We also tested the microfluidics of this system once in our prototype, until we got good migration results.

                                    After an intensive work on the human thrombin, we tested HIV-1 Reverse Transcriptase (RT).
                                    This particular target would allow us to detect HIV infections at a very early stage, when this virus has just penetrated the host.
                                    At this stage antibodies are produced by the patient’s body yet,
                                    so conventional methods of detection are not valid. We did an EMSA with the most efficient HIV RT aptamer we could find.

                                    The sensitivity is again quite good, with the same warnings than for thrombin.

                                    Then, we tried to do the same with 3 known aptamers against the HBV’s surface antigen (HBsAg).

                                    The sensitivity was worse than in the previous EMSAs with the thrombin and the RT.
                                    We chose the two best for our detection, but we hope to improve them to get a better sensitivity.
