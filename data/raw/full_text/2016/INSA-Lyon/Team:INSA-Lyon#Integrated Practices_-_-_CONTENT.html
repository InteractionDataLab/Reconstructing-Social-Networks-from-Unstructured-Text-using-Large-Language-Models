                                Our human practices reflection is based on the <STRONG>interactions</STRONG> between the conception of our <STRONG>device</STRONG> and the <STRONG>society</STRONG>. How could our work be integrated in the prevention of STIs? The goal was to conduct a rigorous <STRONG>reflexion on the project</STRONG>. First we used the knowledge acquired during <A href="https://2016.igem.org/Team:INSA-Lyon/Engagement">meetings and surveys</A> we carried to build an ethical matrix.
                                The help provided by our human sciences instructors was very valuable as they guided us through interesting ways of thinking.
                            </P><A target="_blank" href="https://static.igem.org/mediawiki/2016/8/80/T--INSA-Lyon--matrice.pdf">Ethical matrix - Click to enlarge</A><P>
                                Once the matrix was established, on the one hand, we confronted it with the <STRONG>results of the survey</STRONG> in the matrix synthesis.
                                On the other hand, it was used as an instrument to have a <STRONG>human overview of the project</STRONG> to take a needed step back as everyone was focused on its parts. An ethical matrix was a useful framework to assist us in our deliberation about technical choices but also social choices.
                            </P><P>
                                The matrix synthesis was realized to have a humanist point of view integrated into our project. In this perspective, we used the approach of the ethic of care (Joan Tronto, <SPAN style="font-style:italic">Moral boundaries: a political argument for ethic of care</SPAN>, 1993) to interpret our results.
    We identified 4 statements: <STRONG>innovation, perception, risk, responsibility</STRONG> to improve our project according to two phases of the ethic of care.
                            </P></DIV><DIV class="subtitle" id="intecaring"><H2 class="title">CARING ABOUT</H2><P>
                                The <STRONG>innovation</STRONG> deals with <STRONG>human consequences of our technology</STRONG>.
                                Early detection, short delivery time of results, low cost impact the use of the diagnosis. The early detection allows to improve patient's care, thus the treatment can begin very early. The short delivery time of results is compatible with mobile prevention campaign and emergency situations. Low cost is for better test accessibility and increase the user population. All those decisions were made to develop an attractive test that would answer the technical expectations of healthcare professional.
                            </P><P>
                                The <STRONG>perception</STRONG> of the test by the user was also analyzed to establish the preliminary basis of <STRONG>acceptability issues</STRONG>. The human relationship of the user during the test realization and the management of intimacy were our main reflection axis.
                            </P></DIV><DIV class="subtitle" id="intertaking"><H2 class="title">TAKING CARE OF</H2><P>
                                Integration of the <STRONG>risks</STRONG> was also necessary. We identified 3 major risks. The contamination risk implies to use safe biological materials. The reliability deals with false positive and false negative. It is a technical issue that is related to our technology. The goal is to reduce them as much as possible. The use decay risk introduced by the user.
                            </P><P>
                                The risk principle results in the concept of <STRONG>responsibility</STRONG>. <STRONG>Support</STRONG> is good way to reduce those risks, being supervised by the medical staff can be very reassuring during the test execution. The announcement of the results also questions the presence of medical staff according to the serious consequences of some STIs. The easy access and the simplicity of use are necessary to guarantee <STRONG>an equal right</STRONG> to get diagnosed.
                                Nowadays, the responsibility is not restricted to the user, it must also respect the <STRONG>environment</STRONG>. That’s what motivated our technical choices for the device.
                            </P><P>
                                The matrix was also intended to be <SRONG>a decision helper tool</SRONG>. It was very useful when taking important decision (e.g. changing the revelation system).
                                Matching technical solutions to ethical values (accessibility, respect of the user, biosafety) can be really complex but stimulating!

                                This work can serve as an inspiring example to other 2016 iGEM teams: Stanford-Brown and Michigan. We could organize an ethical debate about our technology. Our work on an ethical matrix is documented but there are still a lot of questions (writen in red in the matrix). With others, we can build upon to answer to doubt.
                                We were able to come up with a device that combines the expertise of physicians specializing in STIs, potential patients’ expectations, curiosity and foresight of young engineering students. So this device can be usable and useful.
