                                      Device 1 seemed to induce the most intensive fluorescence, but the growth of the cells was limited.
                                      As a hypothesis, the promoter may be too strong.
                                      A great amount of the cells resources might be dedicated to the production of GFP, which would explain why the OD is so low. 
                                      Device 3 showed a good growth according to the high OD. However the GFP production was 300 times lower than the device 1.
                                      The promoter may be weaker. Device 2 is a good compromise between cell growth and GFP expression.

                                      There were numerous cells with low fluorescence in the device 1. Was it due to the presence of contaminants or cells with very low GFP expression rate because

                                      Taking part in an international consortium is always a great honor. This study was very enriching.
                                      It was a good opportunity to learn how to use a flow cytometer. 
                                      Our results were sent to the iGEM InterLab Measurement HQ. Now, we can't wait to discover the results of this meta-analysis, and to see the 2016 iGEM teams's works valued in next year's publication !

                                      To obtain results in comparable units with the other iGEM teams, a conversion ratio according to the calibration run was first calculated:

                                      The maximum fluorescence of each peak (i.e. at the center) was determined.
                                      Only peaks with a variation coefficient (CV) under 5% were measured . 
                                      The MEFL value (given by the iGEM) for each RCP-30-5A peak was divided by the observed peak centers to produce a conversion ratio.
                                      The final conversion ratio is the average.

                                      The flow cytometer used for the study is a BD Accuri C6 Analysis with a laser at  488 nm and FL1-A filter at  533/30 nm.
                                      Calibration beads are RCP-30-5A (8 peaks) 3.0-3.4 µm. The cytometer was calibrated before the sample analysis.
                                      For each measurement, 10,000 events were acquired. Between 2 samples,  washing runs were performed in order to avoid any contamination.

                                      Measure OD<SUB>600</SUB> and dilute cells to obtain an OD<SUB>600</SUB> of 0.006 (106 cells.mL-1) required for the flow cytometer assays.
                                      Adjust side-scatter (SSC) and forward scatter (FSC) PMT voltages using bacteria from your negative control, until the distribution of each is centered on the scale.
                                      Adjust FITC/GFP PMT voltage using bacteria from your positive control, until the upper edge of the “bell curve” from the fluorescent population is one order of magnitude below the upper end of the scale.
                                      Acquire at least 10,000 events from a sample of calibration beads: RCP-30-5A (8 peaks), Rainbow Calibration Particles, 10<SUP>7</SUP>/mL, 3.0-3.4 µm.
                                      Acquire at least 10,000 events for each biological sample.
                                      Divide the MEFL value for each RCP-30-5A peak by the observed peak centers, to produce a conversion ratio.
                                      Take the average of the conversion ratios: multiplying arbitrary units by this mean conversion ratio will change them into MEFL.
                                      Compute the geometric mean of fluorescence for each biological sample, excluding all events with values below 10.
                                      Multiply the geometric mean fluorescence for each sample by the mean conversion ratio, to produce a value in MEFL.
