Add 1µL of plasmids to 50µL of competent cells (make a control tube without plasmid).  Keep tubes on ice for 30min and heat shock at 42°C for 1min.  Add 500µL of LB medium into each tube and incubate at 37°C for 1h.  Spread cells on Petri dishes in duplicate and incubate at 37°C overnight.
Electro-competent cells
Preparation
Inoculate 15mL of LB with 200µL of an overnight cell culture.  Incubate at 37°C and 180rpm until OD600nm reaches 0.6.  Centrifuge cells for 10 minutes at 4000rpm.  Wash twice with 10mL of 10% glycerol. Put cells in 200µL of 10% glycerol and use for electroporation.
Transformation
Use an Eppendorf Electroporator 2510 (tune to 2500V).  Add 1µL of plasmids to 50µL of competent cells (make a control tube without plasmid).  Place cells in a 1mm-cuvette, electroporate (the time constant should be close to 6ms) and recover cells with 1mL of cold LB medium. Incubate cells for 1h at 37°C. Spread cells on Petri dishes in two different concentrations and incubate at 37°C overnight.
Plasmid DNA extraction
Transfer 1.5mL of an overnight culture into an eppendorf tube. Centrifuge at 13000rpm for 1min to pellet the cells.  Discard supernatant and resuspend cells in 100µL of TE buffer .  Add 200µL of solution II and mix gently by inverting the tubes until lysate appears clear. Add 150µL of solution III and mixed gently. Keep the solution on ice for 10min. Centrifuge for 10min at 13000rpm and recover the supernatant. Add 100µL of phenol in each tubes to denature the proteins and vortex for 30s.  Centrifuge the tubes for 7min at 13000rpm.  Recover the aqueous phase. Add 2 volumes (900µL) of 100% ethanol and put at -20°C for 10min.  Centrifuge the tubes again for 10min at 13000rpm.  Discard supernatant and wash with 800µL of 70% ethanol to remove the remaining ions. Make sure that the pellet containing DNA remains at the bottom of the tubes.  Centrifuge the tubes for 4min at 13000rpm and remove supernatants. Dry tubes in speedvac.  Resuspend the pellet in 50µL of TE/RNAse.  Keep the extracted plasmids at -20°C.

DNA extraction using the Invitrogen ChargeSwitch®-Pro Plasmid Miniprep Kit
Follow the steps below to purify plasmid DNA from 1-5ml of fresh overnight cultures using a microcentrifuge. All steps are performed at room temperature.
Before Starting
For a new kit, add Rnase A (provided in the kit) to the Resuspension Buffer and mix.
If necessary, warm the Lysis Buffer to 37°C to dissolve any precipitate.
Preparing the Sample
Pellet cells from 1-5 ml of overnight culture.
Resuspend in 250 µL of Resuspension Buffer premixed with Rnase A. No cell clumps should remain.
Add 250 µL of Lysis Buffer. Mix well by gentle inversion. Do not vortex.
Incubate at room temperature for 2-5 minutes. Do not incubate more than 5 minutes.
Add 250µL of Precipation Buffer, and mix well until a white precipitate is formed.
Centrifuge for 10 minutes at maximum speed to pellet the debris.
Binding the DNA
Carefully transfer the supernatant from Step 2.6 above onto the ChargeSwitch®-Pro MiniPrep Colum inserted in a Collection Tube.
Centrifuge the column/tube at maximun speed for 30-60 seconds.
Remove the column from the tube and discard the flow-through. Re-insert the column in the same tube.
Washing the Column
Add 750µL of Wash Buffer 1 to the column.
Centrifuge the column/tube at the maximun speed for 30-60 seconds.
Remove the column from the tube and discart the flow-through. Re-insert the column in the tube;
Add 250µL of Wash Buffer 2 to the column.
Centrifuge the column/tube at maximun speed for 30-60 seconds.
remove the column from the tube. Discard the flow-through and the Collection Tube.
Eluting the DNA
Insert the column into an Elution Tube (provided in the kit).
Add 50-100µL of Elution Buffer onto the column.
Centrifuge the column/tube at maximun speed for 30-60 seconds.
Optional:Remove the Elution Tube and transfer the eluate back onto the same column. Re-insert the column in the tube and centrifugate at maximun speed for 30-60 seconds. This step is recommended for maximun recovery.
The eluate contains your purified plasmid DNA. Store DNA at 4°C or -20°C.
Plasmid digestion
Mix 10µL of extracted plasmid with 2µL of digestion buffer and 7µL of water.  Add 1µL of restriction enzyme. Incubate for 1 hour at 37°C (except for fast digest enzymes which need only 5 min of incubation at 37°C). Then digestion products were migrated on an agarose gel .
gBlock plasmid insertion
The following ratio should be over 7: \[ \frac{vector\ size}{insert\ size}\times\frac{insert\ concentration}{vector\ concentration} \]
Gently centrifuge gBlocks. Add 100µL of TE buffer (final concentration should be around 10ng/µL). Vortex and incubate at 50°C for 20min. Mix 7µL of gBlocks with 1µL of extracted and linearized plasmid, 1µL of ligase and 1µL of ligase buffer. Incubate for 1h at RT.

DNA extraction from agarose gels with NucleoSpin Gel and PCR Clean-up
Excise DNA fragment/solubilize gel slice
Take a clean scalpel to excise the DNA fragment from an agarose gel. Remove all excess agarose.
Determine the weight of the gel slice and transfer it to a clean tube. For each 100 mg of agarose gel<2% add 200µL Butter NT1.
For gels containing >2%, double the volume of Buffer NT1.
Incubate sample for 5-1à min at 50°C. Vortex the sample briefly every 2-3 min until the gel slice is completely dissolved!
Bind DNA
Place a NucleoSPin Gel and PCR Clean-Up Column into a Collection Tube (2mL) and load up to 700µL sample.
Centrifuge for 30s at 11 000x g. Discard flow-through and place the column nack into the collection tube.
PCR sample must have 50-100µL and if not, water is added. 1 volume of sample was mixed with 2 volumes of Buffer NT1.
Wash silica membrane
Add 700µL Buffer NT3 to the NucleoSpin Gel and PCR Clean-up Column. Centrifuge for 30s at 11 000 x g. Discard flow-through and place the column back into the collection tube.
Recommended: Repeat previous washing step to minimize chaotropic salt carry-over and low A260/A260.
Dry silica membrane
Centrifuge for 1 min at 1 000 x g to remove Buffer NT3 completely. Make sure the spin column does not come in contact with the flow-through while removing it from the centrifuge and the collection tube.
Elute DNA
Place the NucleoSpin Gel and PCR Clean-up Column into a new 1.5mL microcentrifuge tube. Add 15-30µL Buffer NE and incubate at room temperature (18-25°C) for 1 min. Centrifuge for 1 min at 11 000 x g.
Analyze on a gel for the presence of the PCR product of the expected length.
Protein extraction from bacterial liquid culture for Western Blot
Mesure the OD of 1 mL overnight cell diluated at 1/10 with LB (make a blank with 1 mL LB). Once the OD is obtained for 1 mL culture, centrifuge 500 µL of culture for 10 minutes at maximum speed. The flow-through is discarded and lysis buffer for Western Blot is added in order to obtain 20 OD.
Volume of lysis buffer to be added: V = ODmeasured x 0,5 / 20
Lysis buffer for Western Blot (SDS 1%, Tris-HCl, DTT, pH = 6.8, bromophenol blue)
Then, put the sample 3 minutes at 95°C. If the middle is too sticky (there is a lot of DNA in E. coli), add 1 μl of MgCl2 and 1 μl of benzoate nuclease (Novgen) and put the middle at 37°C for 10 to 30 minutes.
