Transformation of DH5α|pPS16_004 and DH5α|pPS16_007
By Caroline and Mathilde
The 04/06/2016 transformations show white colony growth for gBlocks 4.2 (pPS16_008) clone 3 and GFP1-9 (pPS16_009) clone 1, but blue colonies only for gBlocks 4.1 (pPS16_007) clone 3.
Thus this last plasmid pPS16_007 was transformed again following the same protocol as the 21/06/2016 with :
50μg of competent DH5α cells
4.1 ligation product in 5μL of the plasmid pUC19 or
4.1 clone 6 extracted DNA (which presented a good size strip on electrophoresis)
6 clones of each of the other transformations pPS16_001, pPS16_002, pPS16_003, pPS16_005 and pPS16_006 were grown in 4mL of LB with Ampicillin (50µg/mL) at 37°C, 180rpm.  For pPS16_002 only 2 clones were cultivated because there was not more colony. To obtain more colonies, another transformation was made with 50µL of cells and 5µL of plasmid. 50µL of transformed bacteria were plated on LB + Ampicillin (50µg/mL).
Plasmid extraction
By Laetitia and Alice
The usual protocol was used to extract plasmids pPS16_008 from 250μL of clone 3 overnight culture and pPS16_009 from 320μL of clone 1 overnight culture (from 28/06/16 transformation). Plasmids were resuspended in 10μL of water with RNAse (50μg/mL).

Cultures were spun down for 5min at 13000rpm. Supernatant was discarded and glass marbles previously cleaned with 1M nitric acid were added with 50μL of Luc buffer. Tubes were vortexed for 30min at 4°C. Everything was then done on ice. 150μL of Luc bufer was added and cells were centrifuged for 15min at 13000rpm at 4°C.
For the luciferase test, 4mL of Luc buffer were mixed to 80μL of ATP and 8μL of luciferine. For the βGal test, 400μL of Z buffer mixed with 10μL of extract and 100μL of ONPG were incubated for 8min at 30°C. Then 250μL of STOP buffer was added. OD420nm was measured.

Biobrick K1372001 : clone 1 and clone 2 plamsid digestion
By Mathilde
The same protocol as the 04.07.2016 was followed. But the incubation step was accidentally interrupted so the epxerience has to conducted again.
Biobrick K1372001 : clone 1 and clone 2 culture
By Alice and Laetitia
10 µL of cultures of the two clones expressing K1372001 were put in culture in 3mL of LB + 3µL of chloramphenicol. Cultures were incubated at 37°C, 180 rpm.
