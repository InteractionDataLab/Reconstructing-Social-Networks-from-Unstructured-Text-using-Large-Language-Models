2.1-2.2 and 3.1-3.2 ligation
By Charlène
8µL of 2.1 purify PCR products, 8µL of 2.2 purify PCR products, 2µL of ligase T4 Buffer and 2L of ligase T4 were mixed. 8µL of 3.1 purified PCR products, 8µL of 3.2 purified PCR products, 2µL of ligase T4 Buffer and 2µL of ligase T4 were mixed. They were incubated for 1h at RT.
Q5 PCR on the ligation products and pPS16_008 clones 1 and 2

An specific primers for each part was used.
The products were migrated on a 0.8% agarose gel with BET.

All the bands have the good size so the PCR products were purify
PCR Clean-up with the NucleoSpin kit
By Mahnaz _ The purification was carried out on PCR products pSB1C3 (linearized) and 4.2 also the ligation products pPS16_003-pPS16_004 and pPS16_005-pPS16_006 following the usual protocol .
Result of the PCR
4.1-4.2 ligation
By Mahnaz
8 µL of 4.1 purified PCR product, 8µL of 4.2 purified PCR product, 2 µL of ligase T4 Buffer and 2 µL of ligase T4 were mixed. The ligation reaction mixture were incubated overnight at 4°C.
