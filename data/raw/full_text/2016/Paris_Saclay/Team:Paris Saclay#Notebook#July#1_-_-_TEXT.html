Migration of plasmids containing gBlocks digestion
By Léa and Alice
Digestion products from 30/06/16 were migrated on a gel (0.8% agarose) for 30 min at 100 V.
pPS16_002, pPS16_003 and pPS16_005 Migration
pPS16_007, pPS16_008 and pPS16_009 Migration

For strains containing pPS16_007 plasmid, according to the digestion products, 2 clones had the plasmid with the good insert. Indeed we could observe on the gel the two expected fragments of 2.7kb and 0.7kb. The same was observed for strains containing gBlocks 4.2 and GFP 1-9, respectively 3 and 2 clones were good. However, DNA concentration was too low. For others strains, migration products did not get consistent results, probably due to errors during the extraction.
