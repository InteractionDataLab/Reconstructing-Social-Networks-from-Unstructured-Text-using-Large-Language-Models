gBlock 1.1, 1.2 and GFP1-9 insertion in puc19
By Caroline
The insertion was carried out following the usual protocol .
High fidelity PCR on bacteria transformed with pPS16_001 , pPS16_002 and pPS16_005
By Alice and Mathilde
A PCR with Q5® High-Fidelity 2X Master Mix was performed on clones selected after screening PCR made on July 28, following this protocol . We choose clones which had the good size of insert. We selected the clone 2 for DH5α|pPS16_001; clones 4,7 and 8 for DH5α|pPS16_002 and clones 1 and 4 DH5α|pPS16_005. 1151_pheoR and 1152_pheoF primers were used. Annealing temperature was 66°C. After amplification, 1 µL of loading dye was added to 5µL of each PCR products. Then 5 µL of this mix were put on gel. PCR products were migrated 30min at 100V.
PCR products expected were :
