Colony PCR of 8 clones containing fragment 1 and 2 (dCas9 Nm GFP 10) in pSB1C3
Mahnaz
Transformed cells on 26th august which had been grown overnight were used for colony PCR. For that purpose, 8 clones containing dCas9 NM - GFP 10 were screened and used for the usual protocol of Colony PCR. The same colonies were also plated on Petri dish containing solid LB + 30 µg/mL Cm and liquid cultures (LB + 30 µg/mL Cm) were made from these clones. Both petri dishes and liquid cultures were grown at 37°C.
For each clones contained in 20 μL water, 5.13 μL of the following mix were added :
2.5 µL DreamTaq Buffer
0.5 µL of dNTPs (10mM)
1 µL of each primer mix (10µM)
0.13 μl of DreamTaq Pol
