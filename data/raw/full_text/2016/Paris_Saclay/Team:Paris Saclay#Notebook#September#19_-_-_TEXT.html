The glycerol stock of the bacteria with the following plasmids were made.
pPS16_018 (FKBP - GFP 10) clone 7
pPS16_018 (FKBP - GFP 10) clone 8
pPS16_018 (FKBP - GFP 10) clone 9
pPS16_018 (FKBP - GFP 10) clone 10
500µL of liquid culture and 250 µL of glycerol 60% were mixed and put at -20°C.

The following plasmids were extracted using the "Charge Switch-Pro Plasmid Miniprep" kit:
pPS16_018 (FKBP - GFP 10) clone 7
pPS16_018 (FKBP - GFP 10) clone 8
pPS16_018 (FKBP - GFP 10) clone 9

Colony PCR of 8 clones containing GFP 1.9 in pSB1C3 (pPS16_020) from the 12th September
By Maxence, Mahnaz, Coline & Caroline
Seqencing of clones 2, 7, 8 and 12 from the 14th September was not good as empty plasmids were obtained. Another colony PCR was done for 8 clones from the 12th September but anothers primers were used.
For that purpose, 8 clones were screened and used for the usual protocol of Colony PCR. The same colonies were also plated on Petri dish containing solid LB + 30 µg/mL Cm and liquid cultures (LB + 30 µg/mL Cm) were made from these clones. Both petri dishes and liquid cultures were grown at 37°C.
For each clones contained in 20 μl water, 5.13 μL of the following mix were added :
2.5 µL DreamTaq Buffer
0.5 µL of dNTPs (10mM)
1 µL of each primer mix (10µM)
0.13 μl of DreamTaq Pol

Primers
iPS168 and iPS169
After amplification, 3 µL of each PCR products and 5 µL of DNA ladder were placed in wells and migrated at 100V during 30 min.
PCR products expected were :
PCR products
Expected band size (bp)
GFP 1.9 in pSB1C3

Furthermore, plasmid extacted from clones containing GFP 1.9 in pSB1C3 (pPS16_018) were also put on the gel.
Result of the migration
Plasmids extracted from clones containing GFP 1.9 in pSB1C3 (pPS16_018) were good, but no PCR products were obtained for GFP 1.9, cloning failed.
PCR of pSB1C3 with dCas9 ST - GFP 11 (pPS16_017) clone 8 to correct mutations
By Maxence, Mahnaz, Coline & Caroline
In order to correct mutations in dCas9 ST - GFP 11, PCR was performed with the following protocol.
For each 50μl of reaction, mix the following reagents :
1 µL of matrix
1 µL of dNTPs (10mM)
2.5 µL of each primer mix (10µM)
10 µL of buffer HF (5X)
0,5 µL of Phusion polymerase
32.5 µL of nuclease free water
Mix gently and aliquot 50 μl of the mix into the PCR tubes on ice.  Perform PCR as follow:

Cleaned-up PCR product has been linearized for further Gibson application by using DpnI treatment :
30 µL of cleaned up PCR product
4 µL of fast digest buffer
1 µL of DpnI
5 µL of water
The mix was placed 10 minutes at 37°C and was cleaned by using the NucleoSpin Gel and PCR Clean-up kit protocol .
