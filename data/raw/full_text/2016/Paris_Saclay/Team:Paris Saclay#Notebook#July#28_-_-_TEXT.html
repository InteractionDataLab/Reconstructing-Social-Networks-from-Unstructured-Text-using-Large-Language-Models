Low Fidelity DreamTaqPCR of DH5a|pPS16_001, DH5a|pPS16_002, DH5a|pPS16_005 and DH5a|pPS16_009
By Mathilde and Laetitia
PCR was performed on 6 clones for each plasmid.
Thus, the PCR mix was done for 24 tubes following the usual protocol .
Each clone was taken off from the Petri dish (27/07) soaked in a PCR mix and finally spread on a Petri dish (LB+AMP+X-Gal+IPTG.
PCR was done with a Tm at 57°C.
Each PCR product was put on agarose gel to migrate. 10µL of blue ladder was used.
PCR products expected were :
Plasmid
pPS16_001
pPS16_002
Band Size (bp)
1007
1007
Only pPS16_001 clone 3 and pPS16_002 clone 1 have amplified at the expected size.
Migration of pPS16_001 (Gblock 1.1) and pPS16_002 (Gblock 1.2)
Migration of pPS16_005 (Gblock 3.1) and pPS16_009 (GFP)

The exact same experiment as previously in the day was made, but with 6 different clones for each cultures. Each clone was taken off from the Petri dish (27/07) soaked in a PCR mix and finally spread on a Petri dish (LB+AMP+X-Gal+IPTG. Each clone was also put in culture in 1,5mL of LB and put in incubation at 37°c, 180 rpm ON.

Biobrick Characterization
BL21 electrocompetent cells in glycerol stock
By Charlène
1 mL of each clone cultured yesterday were put in 500µL of glycerol 60%.  They were conserved at -30°C.
