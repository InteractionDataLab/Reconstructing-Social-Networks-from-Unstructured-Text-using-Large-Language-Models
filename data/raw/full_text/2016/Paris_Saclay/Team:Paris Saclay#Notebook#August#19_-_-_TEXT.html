Q5 PCR on fragments 3 and 4
"By Charlène"
A Q5 PCR was made on fragments 3 and 4 for a gel extraction. Tm = 72°C. Elongation time = 1 minute.  Problem : 25 cycles at the place of 30.
Q5 PCR of fragments 3 and 4
There is not enough product for the extraction gel : a second PCR was done with 30 cycles. It will be run on gel next Monday.
Glycerol stocks
"By Terrence, Alice and Mahnaz"
Glycerol stocks of bacteria transformed with the following plasmids were made.
pPS16_009 (GFP1-9) clone 4
pPS16_009 (GFP1-9) clone 5
pPS16_014 (sgRNA Nm) clone 1
pPS16_014 (sgRNA Nm) clone 2
pPS16_013 (FKBP) clone 3
pPS16_013 (FKBP) clone 4
pPS16_013 (FKBP) clone 5
pPS16_010 (FRB) clone 2
pPS16_010 (FRB) clone 3
pPS16_010 (FRB) clone 5
pPS16_002 (1.2) clone 1
pPS16_002 (1.2) clone 11
500µL of liquid culture and 250 µL of glycerol 60% were mixed and put at -20°C.

Colony and Extraction product DreamTaq PCR
"By Léa and Naiane"
A colony PCR was performed on DH5a transformed with pJet containing sgRNA Nm or 1.2 gBlocks. sgRNA Nm clones 6, 7, 8, 10, 11 and 12 were screened, and 1.2 clones 13 to 18 were screened and spread on Petri dish containing solid LB and Ampicilin.
In the meantime, a DreamTaq PCR was performed on plasmids extractions listed above, using the same PCR mix. The PCR mix was made following the usual protocol . Universal primers for pJET were used (Tm= 51.9°).
For 1.2 gBlock, only the sample from the clone number 14 seems to have an appropriate size (expected at 1073 bp). This clone will be grown and the plasmid will be extracted to be sequenced. For FRB (492bp), plasmid extractions from clones 5 and 2 seem to have an appropriate size and will be send for sequencing. For FKBP12 (537bp), the 3 plasmids extraction will be sent. For 1.2 (1073bp), only plasmid extraction from clone 11 will be sent, and no plasmid extraction will be sent for sgRNA Nm (480bp). No significative stripe is observed for sgRNA Nm gBlock. There is no clone carrying the plasmid of interrest.
