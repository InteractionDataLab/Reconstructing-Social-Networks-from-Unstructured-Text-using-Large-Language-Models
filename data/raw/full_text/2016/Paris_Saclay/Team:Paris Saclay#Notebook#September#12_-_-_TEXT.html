Samples preparation for sequencing
By Maxence & Mahnaz
20 µL of plasmids pSB1C3 FRB - GFP 11 (pPS16_019) (clones 4, 9, 13 and 16) were sent to be sequenced. 20 µL of the primers iPS83 (5µM) and iPS84 (5µM) were sent for sequencing.

Gibson of cleaned up PCR products GFP 1.9 from 9th September x pSB1C3 treated by DpnI from 22nd August
By Maxence & Mahnaz
Gibson was performed with cleaned up PCR products GFP 1.9 (insert) (obtained the 9th September) x pSB1C3 treated by DpnI (plasmid) (obtained the 22nd August) with the following protocol:
For each 20μl of reaction, mix the following reagents :
0.2 µL of insert
3.16 µL of plasmid
6.64 µL of water
10 µL of buffer mix
Two controls were done: one without insert and one without buffer (water was added in order to have a total of 20 µL). The PCR was performed as follow : 1 hour at 50°C.
Transformation of DH5a cells with GFP 1.9 in pSB1C3 (pPS16_020) obtained by Gibson
By Maxence & Mahnaz
Dh5a cells were transformed with pSB1C3 containing GFP 1.9, or controls (no buffer mix and plasmid alone) using the usual protocol .
gblock 1.1 - 1.2 and gblock 2.1 - 2.2 Ligation
By Maxence & Mahnaz
gBlocks pPS16_001 and pPS16_002 were ligated together as following :
8 µL of pPS16_001 PCR product from 9th September
8 µL of pPS16_002 PCR product from 9th September
2 µL of Buffer T4 10X
2 µL of ligase T4 enzyme
This strategy aims to obtain fragment 1.
gBlocks pPS16_003 and pPS16_004 were ligated together as following :
8 µL of pPS16_003 PCR product from 9th September
8 µL of pPS16_004 PCR product from 9th September
2 µL of Buffer T4 10X
2 µL of ligase T4 enzyme
This strategy aims to obtain fragment 2.
The ligation product was put at rooming temperature for 2 hours.
Clean-up of Ligation products
By Maxence & Mahnaz
Ligation products obtained were cleaned up by using the NucleoSpin Gel and PCR Clean-up kit protocol .

PCR of cleaned up Ligation products (fragment 1 and fragment 2) with 3% DMSO
By Maxence & Mahnaz
As the annealing temperature (Tm) seems too high to obtain good results for fragments 1 and 2 amplification, DMSO was used in order to reduce the annealing temperature during the PCR. For that purpose, PCR was performed with the following protocol.
For each 50μl of reaction, mix the following reagents :
1 µL of matrix
1 µL of dNTPs (10mM)
2.5 µL of each primer mix (10µM)
10 µL of buffer (5X)
0,5 µL of Phusion polymerase
31 µL of nuclease free water
1.5 µL of DMSO
Mix gently and aliquot 50 μl of the mix into the PCR tubes on ice.  Perform PCR as follow:

Gel of PCR products
By Maxence & Mahnaz
After amplification, 3 µL of each cleaned up PCR products and 5 µL of DNA ladder were placed in wells and migrated at 100V during 30 min.
PCR products expected were :
PCR products
Expected band size (bp)
Fragment 1
1920
Fragment 2
1831
Result of the migration
A large smearing in agarose gel of PCR products was obtained. As this result was not usable, a new PCR was run by diluting the Ligations products : 1/100, 1/10,000 and 1/1,000,000.
Result of the migration
A large smearing in agarose gel of PCR products was also obtained, but the smears were seemed to decrease with the dilution rate.
