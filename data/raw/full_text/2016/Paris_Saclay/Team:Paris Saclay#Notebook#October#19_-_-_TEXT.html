Cytometry measurements
By Sylvie
There was no clone on the control plate from 18/10. Clones have grown on the other plates.
Transformations were done from the plates containing the preparation diluted 10 times with: 50 mL LB (CM 15μg/L+Amp 50μg/L) 500μL of cell preparation at DO=2,2
This preparation was divided in 4 tubes of 4ml and a falcon tube of 32 ml.
In the 4 tubes, we added rapalog to test the fluorescence:
tube 1: control without rapalog
tube 2: 5 nM of rapalog
tube 3: 50 nM of rapalog
tube 4: 500 nM of rapalog
After 5 hours of culture, cytometry didn't show any fluorescence.
For the falcon of the remaining preparation (32ml):
Centrifuge
Discard the supernatant
Re-suspend the pellet in 15 ml of 100mM Tris (pH= 7,4), 100mM NaCl, 10 % glycerol
Discard the supernatant
Re-suspend in 800 μL of TNG buffer and 20μL of PMSI
Divide the preparation in 8 Eppendorf (100μL)
For one Eppendorf: add glass bead, acid washed (150-212μm)
30 min on vortex
Add 100μL of buffer in each tube
centrifuge
Add Rapalog at 150nM in each tube except for one control
Incubate 30 min
Read on a plate at 488 nm excitation.
