Friday 7th October
BioBrick K2039000 and K2039001 characterization
Culture of FRB - GFP 11 in pSB1C3 (pPS16_019) clone 4, FKBP - GFP 10 in pSB1C3 (pPS16_018) clone 6, GFP 1.9 in pUC19 (pPS16_009) clone 1 and PhB1040 strain 594
By Maxence
The clones put on solid culture the 6th October were put on liquid cultures (LB + 30 µg/mL Cm ou Amp) grown at 37°C overnight:
pPS16_018 (FKBP - GFP 10) clone 6
pPS16_019 (FRB - GFP 11) clone 4
pPS16_009 (GFP 1.9) clone 1
Furthermore, another strain containing the full GFP was cultures in the same conditions: PhB1040 strain 594 (lac-3350 galk2 galT22 2psL179 pGFP) (Amp resistance).
