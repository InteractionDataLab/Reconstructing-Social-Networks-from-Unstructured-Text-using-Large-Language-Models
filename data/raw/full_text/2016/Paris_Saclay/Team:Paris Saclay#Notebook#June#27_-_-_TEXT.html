Interlab study
Cell culture
By Lea
Transformed bacteria frozen on 24/06/2016 were put into 3mL of LB medium containing 30µg/mL chloramphenicol and incubated overnight at 37°C, 180rpm.

Bringing DNA closer
Cell culture
By Alice and Lea
4 plasmids containing NM Cas9 ( DS-NMcas ), SP dCas9 ( DS-SPcasN- ), ST1 dCas9 ( DS-ST1casN- ) and Td dCas9 ( DS-TDcasN- ) were ordered to Addgene and received on 24/06/2016.
Plasmids were delivered into tubes containing LB agar medium and bacteria colony containing plasmids.  Bacteria were put into 15mL of LB medium containing 50µg/mL of spectinomycin and incubated overnight at 37°C, 180 rpm.
BioBrick characterization
By Alice and Lea
BioBrick K1372001 from iGEM team Paris Saclay 2014 was chosen to be characterized.
10µL of DH5α|K1372001 cells were put into 3mL of LB medium containing 30µg/mL of chloramphenicol and incubated overnight at 37°C, 180 rpm.
