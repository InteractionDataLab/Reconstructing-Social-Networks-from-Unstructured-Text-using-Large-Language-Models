pPS16_014 (SgRNA Nm) clone 5, Gibson Assembly's Product (Fragment3-4) clone 6, and pPS16_009 clone 4 extraction
By Terrence
The extraction was carried out following the usual protocol
The Gibson Assembly's Product (Fragment3-4) clone 6 and pPS16_009 clone 4 extraction products were digested with the restriction enzymes XBaI and PSTI
Colony PCR of 12 colonies containing plasmid pJET coding sg-Nm and 12 colonies containing plasmid pJET coding FRB
By Mahnaz
Transformed cells which had been grown overnight were used for colony PCR. For that purpose, 12 clones containing sg-Nm and 12 clones containing FRB were screened and used for the usual protocol of Colony PCR. The same colonies were also plated on Petri dish containing solid LB + 50 µg/mL Amp and liquid cultures (LB + 50 µg/mL Amp) were made from these clones. Both petri dishes and liquid cultures were grown at 37°C.
For each clones contained in 20 μl water, 4.13 μL of the following mix were added :
2.5 µL DreamTaq Buffer
0.5 µL of dNTPs (10mM)
0.5 µL of each primer(10µM)
0.13 μl of DreamTaq Pol

We can't see anything, the only visibles strands are the priers sequence, The result is not satisfying
Q5 high fidelity PCR of ligation products pPS16_001-pPS16_002 and pPS16_003-pPS16_004
By mathilde
Fragment 1 (pPS16_001-pPS16_002) and fragment 2 (pPS16_003-pPS16_004E) were each tested three times (A,B,C) according to the following protocol :
10µL of Q5 buffer
1µL of dNTPs (10mM)
Primers mix (1µL each)
1µL of ligation product
0,25 µL of Q5 high fidelity polymerase
37,75 µL of nuclease free water
The primers used were IPS83 and IPS 122 for the fragment 1, and IPS 84 and 123 for the fragment 2. The PCR programm featured 30s of initial denaturation, 72°c of annealing temperature for 30s and 2min of final extension.
