The extraction was performed using the ChargeSwitch-Pro Plasmid MiniPrep kit from Invitrogen. We followed this protocol .
Stock of glycerol  for pPS16_001, pPS16_002, pPS16_003, pPS16_009 and DS-NMcasN-
By Naiane, Mathilde and Laetitia
Stocks of glycerol were made with:
700 µL of culture
300 µL of glycerol (60%)
PCR Clean-up with the NucleoSpin kit
By Caroline
The purification was carried out on DH5alp|pPS16_003, DH5alp|pPS16_004 and DH5alp|pPS16_007 following the usual protocol . But, I forgot to dilute the sample with the Buffer NT3 with 100mL ethanol befor I began the purification and so no DNA was present on the 0.8% agarose gel.
pPS16_004, pPS16_006 and pPS16_007 Q5 PCR
By Caroline
Q5 PCR was carried out following the usual protocol .
