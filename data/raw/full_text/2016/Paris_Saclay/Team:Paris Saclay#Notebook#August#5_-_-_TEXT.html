Bringing DNA Closer
DNA Extraction of DS-TDcasN- and DS-SPcasN-
By Laetitia
The extraction was performed using the ChargeSwitc-Pro MiniPrep kit from Invitrogen. We followed this protocol .
The initial culture was at 20 mL so we increased (*4) the volumes until the precipitation.
Hence we used:
1 ml of resuspension buffer
1 ml lysis buffer
1 ml precipitation buffer
The colum was used several times in order to recover the maximum of DNA
DNA Extraction of DS-NMcasN- and pPS_001
By Mathilde
The extraction was performed on clone 11 for NM and clone 9 for 1.1 using the ChargeSwitc-Pro MiniPrep kit from Invitrogen. We followed this protocol .
Visualization
Q5 PCR on pPS16_003, pPS16_004, pPS16_006 and pPS16_007
By Caroline
The PCR was carried out following the usual protocol adapted to 50µL and with a TM at 70°C. The specific primers for each parts were used. The products were put for migration on a 0.8%agarose gel with BET. Only, PCR form pPS16_003 and pPS16_004 showed a positive result.

PCR Clean-up with the NucleoSpin kit
By Caroline
The purification was carried out on PCR products 2.1 and 2.2 following the usual protocol .
