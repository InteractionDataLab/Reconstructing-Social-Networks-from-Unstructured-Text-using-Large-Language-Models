Sponsors
We want to send all our love to our sponsors and thank them for the support they provided us. Our whole project would not have been possible without them.
Here is the list of our partners, who they are and what they offered us. A big THANK YOU to all!

Paris-Saclay University
School BMP
8,000€
The Paris-Saclay University is structured in several "Schools" which are in charge of organizing education on specific scientific fields. Every School is in direct link with one or several research departments from the university. The Biology Medecine Pharmacy (BMP) school coordinates 4 masters from different institutes of the Paris-Saclay University:
Paris-Sud University
ENS de Cachan
Ecole Polytechnique
Versailles-Saint-Quentin University
Evry Val d'Essonne University
Its strength relies on the large amount of laboratories implicated in its different diploms.  Their financial support was essential for our team!
FSDIE
7,100€
A small percentage of the university tuition fees goes each year to the Fond de Solidarité et de Développement des Initiatives Etudiantes (Fund for Solidarity and Development of Student Initiatives, FSDIE), whose goal is to help students develop projects (regarding science, sport, solidarity, etc). Students should present an application form which is examined by a jury composed of student representatives and teachers.
There are several criteria of evaluation:
the number of students implicated in the project
the philanthropic aspect of the project
the educative aspect of the project. Will the project be enriching to the participating students?
The reputation and what can it bring to the university
We worked hard so our presence in Boston participates to our university renown!
I2BC
4,000€, material donation and experiment facilities
The Institute of Integrative Biology of the Cell is a lab supported by the Paris-Sud University, the CNRS and the CEA. The institute includes 80 teams of scientists and 15 facilities from 8 research units. It is located in 3 different research campus (Orsay in the Paris-Sud University, Gif-Sur-Yvette in the CNRS, Saclay campus in the CEA).
Our team's supervisors are from this institute. The institute offered us funding and the great opportunity to perform our experiments in their buildings.  No experimentation would have been possible without their tremendous help!
Institut Villebon Georges Charpak
1,850€ and material donation
The Villebon Georges Charpak Institute aims to form undergraduated students into the domain of Science and Technologies using innovative pedagogical approaches. Two of our iGEM members follow this course and had the opportunity to come to Boston thanks to the substantial help of the Institute.
Magistere of Biology
700€
The Magistère of Biology is a diploma which can be obtained in France after 3 years of study. Courses are delivered by teachers from public (CNRS, INRA, Universities) and private (Research & Development) institutions. It covers various aspects of biology: sciences, marketing, communication, journalism etc. This year, 6 of our team members follow this training.
Public funding
French Embassy in the United States
1,250€
The Embassy of France , located in Washington D.C., is the primary French diplomatic mission in the United States. They offered us 1,250€ so we could come to Boston and show the french scientific enthusiasm on synthetic biology. We will do our best to represent our country!
Private companies
NEB
Material donation
New England BioLabs provides high-quality research products to a worldwide scientific community and has an extensive quality control . Their generosity towards iGEM teams has long been known and is still up-to-date!
Clontech Takara
Material donation
Takara Bio USA, Inc. (TBUSA, formerly known as Clontech Laboratories, Inc.) provides kits, reagents, and services that help researchers explore questions about gene discovery, regulation, and function. As a member of the Takara Bio Group, TBUSA is part of a company that holds a leadership position in the global market and is committed to improving the human condition through biotechnology. Their mission is to develop high-quality innovative tools and services to accelerate discovery.
Crowdfunding
Ulule
1,233€
Ulule is a crowdfunding website created in 2010. 16 people contributed to our project because they believed it was very important to us as students and of great significance for science. Thank you again for making our dream come true!
