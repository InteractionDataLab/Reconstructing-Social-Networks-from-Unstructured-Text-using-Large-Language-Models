Plasmids extraction of FRB - GFP 11 in pSB1C3 (pPS16_019) clone 4 and FKBP - GFP 10 in pSB1C3 (pPS16_018) clone 6
By Maxence & Victor
The following plasmids were extracted using the "Charge Switch-Pro Plasmid Miniprep" kit:
pPS16_018 (FKBP - GFP 10) clone 6
pPS16_019 (FRB - GFP 11) clone 4
After extraction, 5 µL of each plasmids and 20 µL of DNA ladder were placed in wells and migrated at 100V during 30 min in order to assess their concentration.
No DNA has been extracted.
Transformation of DH5a cells with and FKBP - GFP 10 (pPS16_018) and FRB - GFP 11 (pPS16_019)
By Maxence & Victor
As we were not able to obtain good plasmid concentration after culture of glycerol stocks and plasmid extraction, transformations were done. Dh5a cells were transformed with pSB1C3 containing FKBP - GFP 10 (pPS16_018) and FRB - GFP (pPS16_019) using the usual protocol .

Culture of FRB - GFP 11 in pSB1C3 (pPS16_019) clone 4, FKBP - GFP 10 in pSB1C3 (pPS16_018) clone 6, GFP 1.9 in pUC19 (pPS16_009) clone 1 and PhB1040 strain 594
By Maxence & Victor
As we have met several issues in order to obtain plasmis pPS16_023 (gBlock ATG linker FRB + GFP 11 + gBlock ATG linker FKBP + GFP 10 + gBlock GFP 1-9), we decided to characterize our BioBricks with a Western-Blot with antibodies against GFP. For that purpose, the following clones were put on solid cultures (LB + 30 µg/mL Cm ou Amp) grown at 37°C overnight:
pPS16_018 (FKBP - GFP 10) clone 6
pPS16_019 (FRB - GFP 11) clone 4
pPS16_009 (GFP 1.9) clone 1
Furthermore, another strain containing the full GFP was cultures in the same conditions: PhB1040 strain 594 (lac-3350 galk2 galT22 2psL179 pGFP) (Amp resistance).
