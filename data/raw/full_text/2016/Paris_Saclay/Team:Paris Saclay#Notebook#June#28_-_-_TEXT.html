Lab work
Stock solutions preparation
200 mL 60% glycerol stock: 120mL glycerol 100% + 80mL water.
200mL CH3COOK 5M stock: 98.15g of CH3COOK powder + 60mL water, shake and add water to 200mL
100mL Solution III (plasmid extraction protocol): 28.5 mL water + 60mL CH3COOK 5M + 11.5 mL of pure liquid CH3COOH
200mL TE stock: 2mL Tris+ 0.4 mL EDTA + water to 200mL
Interlab study
Cytometer
By Caroline, Alice, Lea and Charlene, with Isabelle help
Cells culture created on the 27/06/2016 were analyzed with cytometer. Results were as expected.
Visualization
pUC19 digestion
pUC19 was digested by HincII. A fragment of 2.7kb (linearized plasmid) is expected.
Migration of pUC19 (digested)
pUC19-gBlocks ligation (cf. protocol )
By Charlene
GBlocks were resuspended into 100µL of TE buffer (except for 4-1 which was resuspended into 50µL of TE) in order to get a concentration of 10ng/mL after a quick spin. Solutions were vortexed, incubated for 20min at 50°C, vortexed another time and quickly spun down. The ratio vector size/insert size x 3.5 is calculated to determine if insert is enough in excess compared to vector (it has to be superior than 7). 3.5 represents the ratio insert concentration/ vector concentration.

3 conditions were tested (2 controls):
1µL digested vector + 9µL water
1µL digested vector + 1µL ligase + 1µL ligation buffer + 7µL water
1µL digested vector + 1µL ligase + 1µL ligation buffer + 7µL insert
By using ligation, we hope to obtain the following plasmids:

pPS16_009
The gBlock 2.2 was not avaiblable at the time, that is why it was not transformed with the orthers. But when it will be received it will inserted in puc19 and name after pPS16_004
.
Transformation with ligation products
By Caroline and Charlene
DH5α cells were transformed with ligation products using the usual protocol . Transformed cells were spread on Petri dishes with LB medium containing 50µg/mL of ampicillin and covered with 0.5µL of 80mg/mL XGal and 0.5µL of 1M IPTG.
Bringing DNA closer
Plasmid extraction
By Naiane and Lea
Plasmids from cell culture of the 27/06/2016 were extracted following the usual protocol .
Cells transformation
By Naiane
Extracted plasmids (2µL) were transformed into DH5α competent cells (50µL) using the usual protocol .
BioBrick characterization
Plasmid extraction
By Lea
The usual protocol was used to extract K1372001 from DH5α cells, except the phenol chloroform step was not done.
BL21 competent cell culture
By Caroline
A colony of BL21 cells was put into 4mL of LB medium and incubated overnight at 37°C, 180 rpm. For this part of the project, we will used BL21 e. coli strain because K1372001 contained a tRNAsup for UAG which DH5alp has naturally.
