Gel Electrophoresis of Gibson Assembly's products(fragment 3-4) and GFP 1-9 cloned in PSB1C3
By Terrence
Colony PCR of 12 colonies transformed with Gibson Assembly products (fragment 3-4).
Colony PCR of 12 colonies containing the GFP 1-9.
- Clones 2, 4, 7 and 11 are as expected for GFP 1.9.

Then we transformed 2µL of ligation product into 50 µL of DH5a competent cells, following the usual protocol .
Transformation products were plated with three different volume : 50µL , 150µl and 350µL. 350µL only for the control.
Plasmid DNA extraction (Midi Prep)
By Léa & Manhaz
We have decided to use the plasmid coding dCas9 Nm to amplify the fragement corresponding g-block 1.2. 200 mL of transformed DH5a cells with Adgene dCas9 Nm plasmids (clone 1 and 2) cultures were extracted usind a Midi Prep kit. It was resuspended into 50µL of sterile water.
The plasmid then reserved in -20.
PCR Q5 on plasmid
By Léa & Manhaz
Plasmid pJet cotnains gblock 1.2 (confirmed by sequencing) was used as template to amplify the fragement 1.2. also we amplify the plasmids extracted from 2 colonies contrain the plasmid coding dCas Nm ordered from adgene.
Q5 PCR was performed on plasmids with the following protocol:
For each 50μl of reaction, mix the following reagents :
1 µL of plasmid
1 µL of dNTPs (10mM)
1 µL of each primer mix (10µM)
10 µL of Q5 buffer (5X)
0,5 µL of Q5 high fidelity polymerase
35,5 µL of nuclease free water
Mix gently and aliquot 50 μl of the mix into the PCR tubes on ice.  Perform PCR as follow:

gBlock 1.1 and gblock 1.2  Ligation
By Mahnaz
gBlock 1.1 and gblock 1.2 were ligated together as following :
8µL of gBlock 1.1 PCR product from the 04/08/2016
8µM of gblock 1.2 PCR product from 24/08/2016
2µL of Buffer T4 10X
2µL of ligase T4 enzyme
The ligation product was put at 4°c overnight.
