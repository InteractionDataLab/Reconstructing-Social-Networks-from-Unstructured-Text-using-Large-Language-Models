New gBlocks spacer 1, Nm_sgRNA, ATG_linker-FKBP, St_sgRNA, Detection, ATG_linker-RFB insertion in puc19
By Léa and Charlène
The insertion of these gblocks was carried out following the usual protocol .
Transformation of new gBlocks and 1.2, 1.2, 3.1 and 4.1 inserted in puc19
By Léa and Mathilde
gBlocks spacer 1, Nm_sgRNA, ATG_linker-FKBP, St_sgRNA, Detection, ATG_linker-RFB,1.2, 1.2, 3.1 and 4.1 inserted in puc19 were transformed following the usual protocol . For each plasmid we streaked 50µL and 150µL of bacteria on LB + X-Gal + IPTG Petri dishes.
gBlock 3.1 insertion in puc19

The insertion was carried out following the usual protocol .
DH5alp|pPS16_003, DH5alp|pPS16_004, DH5alp|pPS16_006 and DH5alp|pPS16_007 streak to recover colonies
By Caroline
Checked DH5alp transformed with pPS16_003, pPS16_004, pPS16_006 and pPS16_007 were streaked on Pteri dishes containing LB + Amp (50µg/mL) + IPTG (0.1 µL/mL) + Xgal (0.25µL/mL) from glycerol cultures.
