Wednesday 6th July
Preparation of LB solid and liquid stock
By Léa, Naiane, Laetitia
- 2L of LB liquid : 20g/L powder LB + 2L water μQ
- 1L of LB solid : 1L of LB liquid +15g/L of Agar
The solutions were put in autoclave for sterilization with the help of Sylvain.
Biobrick characterization
DNA extraction of K1372001 clone 1 and clone 2
By Mathilde
Plasmids DNA were extracted following the usual protocol except that isopropanol was used instead of 100% ethanol and that pellets were dried on the lab bench top instead of with the speedvac. The extractions were kept at -20°C.
Visualization
gBlocks PCR screening
By Caroline
A PCR screening was carried out on colonies of bacteria transformed with the gBlocks (6 clones for each except pPS16_004 for which it was only 2 clones). We use the Taq usual protocol. We used puc19 primers 1151_pheoR and 1152_pheoF.
1 μL of each culture were added for each gblock pPS16_001, pPS16_002, pPS16_003, pPS16_004, pPS16_005, pPS16_006 and pPS16_007.
pPS16_004, pPS16_007 and the pPS16_007 clone 6 (selected on 01/07/2016) streaks
By Léa, Caroline and Laetitia
The transformations carried out the 30/06/2016 were streaked again on LB Petri dishes containing 50µg/ml of amplicilin on which X-Gal/IPTG was spread on (white/blue screen). The Petri dishes were incubated ON at 37°C.
