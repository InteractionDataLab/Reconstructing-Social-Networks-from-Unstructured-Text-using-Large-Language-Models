Media
Members of our team, Victor and Etienne, were interviewed by the online magazine of Paris-Saclay, the “Paris-Saclay Media”. Paris-Saclay Media addresses to all the public concerning the University Paris-Saclay. We were very pleased to be interviewed because Paris Saclay Media follows the updates on the interdisciplinary domains of the University Paris-Saclay. Interdisciplinarity is a major part of the DNA of our team and the iGEM competition, so it was a great experience! Click here to discover the article (in French).
Paris Saclay, a place for synthetic biology
Each year, since 2012, a team of students participates for Paris Saclay at an international biology competition created by the iGEM foundation. In October, the team will join nearly 300 others teams to introduce their project. Etienne Kukielczynski and Victor Billon, respectively physician and biologist students, told us more with Sylvie Lautru, who help them with phD students and others researchers as advisors.
