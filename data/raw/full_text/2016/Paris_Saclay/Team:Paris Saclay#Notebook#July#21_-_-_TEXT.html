Biobrick characterization
K1372001 from clone 2 digestion
By Alice and Terrence
We made a digestion of K1372001 plasmid following this protocol .  We used EcoRI and PstI fast digest enzymes.  After incubation, 3.3 mL of loading dye is added to digestion products.  We put on gel 10µL of DNA ladder and 20 µL of digestion products. We set the eletrophoresis machine at 100V for 25min.
Digestion products expected were :

Making Petri dishes of medium LB (with streptomycin or IPTG and X-Gal)
By Laetitia
A Petri dish with LB and streptomycin was made with:
20 mL of LB agar
10µL of streptomycin (initial concentration 100mg/mL)
We added IPTG and xGal on Petri dishes of LB and Ampicillin. For each Petri dish:
500µL of water
1µL of IPTG
1µL of X-Gal
The solution was spread on Petri dish
Liquid culture of DH5a transformed with pcl_TAA, pcl_TAG and pcl_Tq
By Laetitia
2 clones of each Petri dish were inoculated in a tube of LB and Streptomycin.
6 tubes were made. For each tube:
1 mL LB
0.5 µL streptomycin
The tubes were incubated at 37°C and 180 rpm overnight.

Low Fidelity Dreamtaq PCR of DH5α transformed with pPS16_002, pPS16_004 and pPS16_007
By Mathilde
DH5α|pPS16_007 that were put in culture the day before showed blue colonies for the clones 5 and 11. Thus those clones can not be used for high fidelity PCR and be sequenced.
A DreamTaq PCR was made with transformed cultures  pPS16_002, pPS16_004 and pPS16_007 following the usual protocol with Tm at 57°C.
We divided up the PCR mix in 18 PCR tubes and added in each one a different clone from transformed each of our three cultures. The picked colonies were spread on a Petri dish medium LB + Ampicillin (50µg/mL) + X-Gal/IPTG (1/1000).
Results : PCR products expected were :
Plasmid
pPS16_002
pPS16_004
pPS16_007

The electropheresis on agarose gel showed good size product PCR for pPS16_004 clones 2 to 6, for pPS16_002 clone 5, and  pPS16_007 clones 2 and 3.
