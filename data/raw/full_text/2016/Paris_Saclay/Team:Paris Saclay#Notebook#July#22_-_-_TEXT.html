Low Fidelity Dreamtaq PCR of DH5α|pPS16_002
By Mathilde
A DreamTaq PCR was made with DH5α|pPS16_002 cultures following the usual protocol with Tm at 57°C.
We divided up the PCR mix in 6 PCR tubes and added in each one a different clone from the transformed culture. The picked colonies were spread on a Petri dish with LB + Ampicillin (50µg/mL) + X-Gal/IPTG (1/1000).
Results : PCR products expected were :
Plasmid
pPS16_002
Band Size (bp)
960
The electropheresis on agarose gel showed absolutely no PCR products.  pPS16_002 transformation from the 19/07/2016 was spread (50µL) on two Petri dishes LB + Ampicillin (50µg/mL) + X-Gal/IPTG (1/1000).
High Fidelity Q5 PCR of  transformed DH5α with pPS16_004 and pPS16_007
By Laetitia
The PCR was performed following the usual protocol . 8 tubes were done: 5 clones of pPS16_004 and 3 clones of pPS16_007
The Tm was at 60°C

Glycerol stocks for DH5α transformed with pcl_TAA, pcl_TAG and pcl_Tq
By Laetitia
8 stocks were made: 2 clones (Cl 1 and Cl 2) :
Cl1 and Cl2 of  pcl_TAA
Cl1 and Cl2 of  pcl_TAG
Cl1 and Cl2 of  pcl_Tq
For 1 glycerol stock:
1mL of liquid culture
500 μL of glycerol 60%
