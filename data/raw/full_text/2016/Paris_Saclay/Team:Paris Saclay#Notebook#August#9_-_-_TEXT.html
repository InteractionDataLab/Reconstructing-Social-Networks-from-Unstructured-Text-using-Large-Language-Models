Heat shock transformation
By Charlène and Terrence
For 1.2, 4.2, SgNm, SgSt1, Detection, FRB and FKBP gBlocks, the sequençing results were not as expected. So, we transformed  pPS16_002, pPS16_008, pPS16_010, pPS16_011, pPS16_012, pPS16_013 and pPS16_014 in DH5a. We followed the usual protocol . 50µL of cells were streaked on LB + Amp (50µg/mL) + IPTG + xGal.
Extraction of pPS16_001, pPS16_005, pPS16_006, pPS16_007 and pPS16_009
By Caroline
Plasmids pPS16_001 (1.1), pPS16_005(3.1), pPS16_006(3.2), pPS16_007(4.1) and pPS16_009 (GFP) were extracted folllowing this protocol .
Result of the extraction
Phusion PCR on pPS16_001, pPS16_005, pPS16_006, pPS16_007 and pPS16_009
By Caroline
The PCR was carried out following the usual protocol adapted to 50µL and with a Tm at 72°C. The specific primers for each parts were used. The products were put for migration on a 0.8%agarose gel with BET. Gel 1
PCR was made again to increase PCR products quantities. gel2
pPS16_001 (1.1), pPS16_005 (3.1), pPS16_006 (3.2), pPS16_007 (4.1) and pPS16_009 (GFP).

pUC19 digestion with HincII enzyme
By Alice
5 µL of pUC19 plasmids were digested with 5µL of tango buffer 10X, 38µL of sterile water, and 1 µL of HincII enzyme. The mix was incubated at 37°C for 1 hour. After incubation, 1µL of HincII enzyme was added again, and the mix was incubated 1 hour again. Digestion products were migrated on a gel on August 10 .
pUC19 ligation with gBlocks ATG linker RFB, detection, St sgRNA, ATG linker FKBP, Nm sgRNA, 1.2 and 4.2
By Alice
Ligations of gBlocks with pUC19 were performed following this protocol . The final mix was incubated at 4°C overnight.  Two control conditions were tested:
1µL of linearized pUC19 + 9 µL of sterile water
1µL of linearized pUC19 + 1 µL of ligase + 1µL of ligase buffer + 7µL of sterile water
With this ligation, we hope to get the plasmids below:
gBlock
ATG linker RFB

St sgRNA
ATG linker FKBP

Bringing DNA closer
Preculture of DH5a cells transformed with Sp and Td dCas9
By Léa
200mL of liquid LB medium (spectinomycin 50µg/mL) were inoculated with DH5a cells transformed with Sp or Td dCas9 from glycerol stock, in order to extract the plasmids.
