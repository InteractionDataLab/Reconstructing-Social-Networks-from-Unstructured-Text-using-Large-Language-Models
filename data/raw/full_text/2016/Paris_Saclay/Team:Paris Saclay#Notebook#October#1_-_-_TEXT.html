Digestion of GFP 1.9 in pUC19 (pPS16_009) clone 1
By Maxence & Victor
As we had several issues to clones GFP 1.9 in pSB1C3 by Gibson and digestion-ligation, pPS16_009 was digested by BsaBI restriction enzymes in order to verify if the template we used was the good one. For that purpose, GFP 1.9 in pUC19 (pPS16_009) clone 1 was cut by restriction enzymes BsaBI as following:
7 µL of GFP 1.9 (pPS16_009) clone 1
2 µL of buffer orange
2 µL of restriction enzyme BsaBI
9 µL of water
The mix were incubated for 30 minutes at 37°C. Then, 20 µL of each digestion products and 5 µL of DNA ladder were placed in wells and migrated at 100V during 30 min.

For that purpose, FRB - GFP 11 (pPS16_019) clone 4 was cut by restriction enzymes XbaI & PstI as following:
10 µL of FRB - GFP 11 (pPS16_019) clone 4
2 µL of buffer FD
1 µL of restriction enzyme XbaI
1 µL of restriction enzyme PstI
6 µL of water
And FKBP - GFP 10 - pSB1C3 (pPS16_018) clone 6 was cut by restriction enzymes SpeI & PstI as following:
10 µL of FKBP - GFP 10 - pSB1C3 (pPS16_018) clone 6
2 µL of buffer FD
1 µL of restriction enzyme SpeI
1 µL of restriction enzyme PstI
6 µL of water
The mix were incubated for 20 minutes at 37°C. Then, 20 µL of each digestion products and 5 µL of DNA ladder were placed in wells and migrated at 100V during 30 min.
Migration products expected were :
Migration products
Expected band size (bp)
Template digested (pPS16_019 treated by XbaI & PstI)

Result of the migration
The digestion products were cleaned up from the gel by using the NucleoSpin Gel and PCR Clean-up kit protocol .

By Maxence & Victor
For that purpose, GFP 1.9 PCR product from the 9th September was cut by restriction enzymes PstI & XbaI as following:
5 µL of GFP 1.9 PCR product from the 9th September
2 µL of buffer FD
1 µL of restriction enzyme PstI
1 µL of restriction enzyme XbaI
11 µL of water
Furthermore, Bba0015 plasmid (in order to have pSB1C3) was cut by restriction enzymes PstI & XbaI as following:
10 µL of Bba0015 plasmid
2 µL of buffer FD
1 µL of restriction enzyme PstI
1 µL of restriction enzyme XbaI
6 µL of water
The mix were incubated for 30 minutes hour at 37°C. Then, 2 µL of each digestion products and 5 µL of DNA ladder were placed in wells and migrated at 100V during 30 min.
Migration products expected were :
