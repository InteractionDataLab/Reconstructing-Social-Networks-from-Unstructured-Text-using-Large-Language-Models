Electro transformation of DH5a cells with K2039002
By Sylvie
4 samples of DH5a cells were transformed using electroporation protocol using:
1µL of K2039002 preparation, diluted 10 times
1 µL of K2039002 preparation, no dilution
5 µL of K2039002 preparation, no dilution
1 control (without DNA)
Transformed cells were plated on LB solid media with Chloramphenicol and Ampicilin.
