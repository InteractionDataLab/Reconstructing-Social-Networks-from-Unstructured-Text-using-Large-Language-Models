Plasmids extraction of FRB - GFP 11 - FKBP - GFP 10 in pSB1C3 (pPS16_021) and GFP 1.9 in pSB1C3 (pPS16_020) transformed the 11th October
By Sylvie
The following plasmids were extracted using a "standard Plasmid Miniprep" :
24 clones containing pPS16_020 (GFP 1.9)
pPS16_021 (FRB - GFP 11 FKBP - GFP 10)
Digestion of FRB - GFP 11 - FKBP - GFP 10 in pSB1C3 (pPS16_021) and GFP 1.9 in pSB1C3 (pPS16_020) transformed the 11th October
Extracted pPS16_020 and pPS16_021 were digested by restriction enzyme NotI:
4 µL of plasmid
2 µL of buffer Tango
1 µL of restriction enzyme NotI
13 µL of water
The mix were incubated for 30 minutes at 37°C. Then, 20 µL of digestion products and 15 µL of DNA ladder were placed in wells and migrated at 100V during 30 min.
