PCR of gblock 1.1 - 1.2 (fragment 1) and gblock 2.1 - 2.2 (fragment 2) Ligation products
By Maxence & Mahnaz
With the results obtained the 12th and 13th September, a new amplification approach was tested: the Ligation products from the 12th were diluated at 1/10 and two buffer (HF and GC) were tested with others different PCR conditions. Furthermore, ligations products from the 13th September were also amplified.
For each 50μl of reaction, mix the following reagents :
1 µL of matrix
1 µL of dNTPs (10mM)
2.5 µL of each primer mix (10µM)
10 µL of buffer (5X)
0,5 µL of Phusion polymerase
32.5 µL of nuclease free water
Mix gently and aliquot 50 μl of the mix into the PCR tubes on ice.  Perform PCR as follow:

Result of the migration
The results were the same as previous ones.
Another strategy was to make a PCR directly of fragments 1 and 2 obtained previously even if these fragments were not working for Gibson. Fragments 1 and 2 from the 2nd September were amplified with the same protocol as mentioned above.

In order to obtain pZA11 containing the desired sequences (pPS16_025), gblocks were amplified in order to run Gibson. For that purpose, PCR was performed with the following protocol.
For each 50μl of reaction, mix the following reagents :
1 µL of matrix
1 µL of dNTPs (10mM)
2.5 µL of each primer mix (10µM)

All PCR products were at the good size but there were no results obtained for NM sgRNA.
Another PCR was run in order to obtain PCR products from NM sgRNA, the good TM was used (63°C).

5 µL of water
The mix was placed 10 minutes at 37°C and was cleaned by using the NucleoSpin Gel and PCR Clean-up kit protocol .
