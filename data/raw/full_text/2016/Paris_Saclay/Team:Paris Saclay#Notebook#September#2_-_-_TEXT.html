Q5 PCR and Phusion PCR of gblock 1.1 in pUC19, gblock 1.2 in pJET , gblock 2.1 in pUC19 and gblock 2.2 in pUC19
By Mahnaz
Q5 PCR and phusion PCR were performed on plasmids with the following protocol:
For each 50μl of reaction, mix the following reagents:
1 µL of plasmid
1 µL of dNTPs (10mM)
1 µL of each primer mix (10µM)
10 µL of Q5 buffer (5X)
0,5 µL of Q5 high fidelity polymerase
35,5 µL of nuclease free water
Mix gently and aliquot 50 μl of the mix into the PCR tubes on ice.  Perform PCR as follow:

Result of migration
This experiment confirms the efficiency of Q5 enzyme in amplifying the gblocks considering the annealing temperature of the primers which are rather high 72°C.
PCR Clean-up of PCR products
By Mahnaz
PCR products obtained were cleaned up by using the NucleoSpin Gel and PCR Clean-up kit protocol .
