Transformation of DH5a cells with pPS16_020
By Léa
Dh5a cells were transformed with pPS16_020 (GFP 1-9 ligated with pSB1C3 digested), or the linearized pSB1C3 (control), or not transformed (control) using the usual protocol .
pPS16_010 extraction
By Alice
After colony screening PCR, 3 clones (clones 3, 7 and 8) seemed to have the insert of interest. Plasmids from these clones were extracted following this protocol . After extraction, plasmids were migrated on a gel.

High Fidelity Phusion PCR of transformed cell with ligation 2 and 3
By Laetitia
Phusion PCR was performed on the ligation product 2 (gBlock 2.1 ligated with gBblock 2.2) and the ligation product 3 (gBlock 3.1 ligated with gBlock 3.2) made on 09/08/16. It was done following this protocol . For the PCR on ligation 2 the primers used were IPS 123 and IPS 84. For the PCR on ligation 3 the primers used were IPS 128 and IPS 83.

DreamTaq PCR of transformed cell with pPS16_002,008,010, 011, 012, 013, 014 and puC19
By Léa and Laetitia
PCR DreamTaq was performed on 6 clones of each transformed cells from 10/08/16. Each clone was spread and put in liquid culture with LB and Ampicillin. No PCR products were observed on the gel.
Phusion PCR on PSB1C3
By Alice
pSB1C3 was amplified with Phusion polymerase following this protocol . Two primers ( iPS41 and iPS42 ) were used. Annealing temperature was 70.9°C. After amplification, 5 µL of each PCR products with loading dye and 10 µL of DNA ladder were placed on gel and migrated at 100v during 30 min.

Result of the ligation 2-3 PCR.
By Caroline
We made the PCR again as the previous result was not satisfying.  Ligation product were cultivate overnight.
