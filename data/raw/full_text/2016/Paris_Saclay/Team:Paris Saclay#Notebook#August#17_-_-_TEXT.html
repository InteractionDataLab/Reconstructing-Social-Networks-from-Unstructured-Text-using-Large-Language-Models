Biobrick characterisation
Culture of BL21|K1372001 and pcl_TAA, pclTAG or pclTq
By Charlène
3 clones from each transformation condition (K1372001 and pcl_TAA, pclTAG or pclTq) were grown in 500µL of LB, streptomycin (50µg/mL) and chloramphenicol (30µg/mL). Then each solution was split into 3x150µL and 350µL of mix of LB + streptomycin (50µg/mL) + chloramphenicol (30µg/mL) were added to each culture. Salicylate (main solution at 10mM) was added to obtain the following concentrations : 0, 0.03mM and 1mM.
Visualization
Extraction of pPS16_003, pPS16_004 and GFP1-9_PSB1C3 (clones 2 and 3)
By Charlène
Clones 2 and 3 of GFP1-9_PSB1C3, and pPS16_003, pPS16_004 were extracted with the Plasmid MiniPrep kit .
The extracts were put on migration on a 0.8%agarose gel with BET.
Purification of gBlocks 2, 3 and 4
By Terrence
The purification was carried out following the usual protocol .

Cloning with pJET the gBlock 1.2, FRB, FKBP and SgNM
By Léa and Naiane
The cloning was carried out using a new protocol which uses pJET as cloning vector.
A heat shock transformation was made on the cloning samples using the following protocol
Q5 PCR on gBlocks (1.2, NM_Sg_RNA, FRB and FKBP) and products of 4.1 and 4.2 gBlocks ligation
By Alice
Q5 PCR was performed directly on gBlocks to amplify them following this protocol . Primers used were:
gBlocks
1.2
NM_Sg_RNA
FRB
FKBP
4.1 and 4.2 gBlocks ligation
Primers
iPS121 and iPS122
iPS133 and iPS83
iPS149 and iPS150
iPS145 and iPS146
iPS129 and iPS84
Annealing temperature was 70°C. After amplification, 1 µL of each PCR products and 10 µL of DNA ladder were placed on gel and migrated at 100v during 30 min.
PCR products expected were :
gBlocks

Migration of gBlocks and ligation
Total volume migration of PCR products 1.2 and Lig 4
By Terrence
A second migration on agarose gel was performed with the total volume of the PCR products 1.2 and 4. The migration allowed us to excise the DNA fragments from the agarose gel below and carried on with the Step 1 of the NucleoSpin Gel and PCR Clean-up kit protocol .
The excised bands from Step 1 were incubated with the buffer NT1 at 4°C overnight.

Low Fidelity DreamTaqPCR of DH5a|pPS16_020, DH5a|pPS16_010, DH5a|pPS16_012 and DH5a|pPS16_013
By Mathilde
PCR was performed on clones 1 to 5 for pPS16_020, clones 1,2,3,5 and 6 for pPS16_010, clones 1,2,3 and 6 for pPS16_012, and for clones 1,4 and 6 for pPS16_013. Both white and blue colonies were picked for each plasmids.
Thus, the PCR mix was done for 17 tubes following the usual protocol . But 1µL of dNTPs were used instead of 2,5µL, and colonies were put in the water before the addition of the rest of the mix for each sample. Primers 1151 and 1152 were used, the initial denaturation time was 5min, and Tm = 57°c.
Each clone was put in liquide culture (LB 3mL + Ampicillin 50µg/mL)
Each PCR product was placed on agarose gel to migrate. 10µL of violet ladder was used.
PCR products expected were :
Plasmid
pPS16_020
pPS16_010
pPS16_012
pPS16_013

Result of the PCR
No PCR product presented the expected size.
Digestion of pPS16_013 clones 2 and 3
By Mathilde
The two plasmids were digested with the XbaI and PstI enzymes with the following protocol :
2µL of plasmid
0,5µL of each restriction enzyme
1µL of Green Fast Digestion Buffer
6 µL of sterile water
The two preparations were put for incubation during 5 min at 37°c, and then directly put to migrate.
