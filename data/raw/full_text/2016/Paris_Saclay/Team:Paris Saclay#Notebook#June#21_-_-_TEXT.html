Tuesday 21st June
Heat-shock competent cells preparation
By Lea, Caroline and Marion
Culture OD was measured at 600nm (OD600nm = 3.4).  3.4mL were put into 250mL of LB medium and incubated at 20°C and 180rpm overnight.
Interlab study
Transformation (cf. protocole )
By Lea, Caroline and Marion
50µL of competent DH5α cells were transformed with 1µL of plasmids (for each construction: device 1, 2, 3, negative control and positive control) and one control tube was made without plasmids. Tubes were kept into ice for 30min then a thermal shock was made at 42°C for 1min. 500µL LB medium was added into each tube and incubated at 37°C for one 1h.  Petri dishes were prepared with selective medium containing LB, agar and 30µg/mL chloramphenicol.  Each transformation condition was spread on Petri dishes in duplicate and incubated overnight at 37°C.
