By Charlène, Mathilde, Laetitia, Caroline and Léa
A Low fidelity PCR was carried out following the usual protocol and using the puc19 primers . 6 clones for each transformations were tested.
Each clone was spread and put at 37°C. We also did a liquid culture for each clone in 3mL of LB and Ampicilin(37°C and 180 rpm).

Sequencing of the gBlock 4.2
By Caroline
The PCR products obtained with Q5 on pPS16_008 were sent for sequencing.
Culture of DH5alp|pPS16_003, DH5alp|pPS16_004, DH5alp|pPS16_006, DH5alp|pPS16_007 and DH5alp|pPS16_008
By Caroline
One colonie from each transformation was put into LB + Amp (50µg/mL) and incubated overnight at 37°C and 180rpm.
Interlab Study
Device 1 transformation
By Caroline
The device 1 was transformed in DH5alp following the usual Heat-shock protocol . The transformations were streaked on Petri dishes LB+Amp(50µg/mL)+IPTG(0.1µL/mL)+XGal(0.25µL/mL) and incubated overnight at 37°C.
