Extraction of the plasmids containing gBlocks
By Alice and Lea
Plasmids pPS16_001-009 (except pPS16_004) were extracted following the extraction protocol . Each plasmids were extracted from 6 different clones of bacteria. At the end, plasmids were resuspended in water/RNAse (5µL RNAse 10 mg/mL for 1 mL of water).
Digestion of the plasmids containing gBlocks
By Alice and Léa
After extraction, plasmids were digested with EcoRI and HindIII.

The mix was incubated for 1 hour at 37°C and then stored at -20°C until the gel electrophoresis was done. Fragments are expected to be as follow:

Biobrick characterization
BL21 electrocompetent cells preparation and transformation
By Caroline and Charlene
The usual protocol was used for transforming cells with K1372001, K1372001+pcl_TAA and the controls which were done following the same protocol but without plasmids. K1372001 and the controls were streaked on LB + Cm (30µg/mL). K1372001+pcl_TAA was streaked on LB + Cm (30µg/mL) + streptomicin (50µg/mL). This time two different streaks were made for each plasmid, the first one using 50µL from the culture, the second one with 400µL concentrated by centrifugation.
The Petri dishes made on 29/06 were stored at 4ºC.
