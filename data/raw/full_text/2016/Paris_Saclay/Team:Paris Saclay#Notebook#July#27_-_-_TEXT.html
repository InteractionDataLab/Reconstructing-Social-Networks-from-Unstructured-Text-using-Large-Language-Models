Visualization
Transformation of DH5a cells
By Léa
DH5a were transformed with pPS16_001, pPS16_002, pPS16_005, or pPS16_009 using the usual protocol . pPS16_002 ligation products of the 19th of July and the 27th of July were used.  pPS16_001, pPS16_005 and pPS16_009 ligation products of the 26th of July were used. The Heat shock were performed at 42°C during 60 seconds.
After a one hour incubation, transformation products were streaked on Petri dishes containing Ampicilin, xGal and IPTG, and incubated at 37°C overnight.
gBlock 1.2 insertion in puc19
By Caroline
The insertion was carried out following the usual protocol .
Biobrick Characterization
BL21 electrocompetent cells preparation for glycerol preparation
By Charlène
We obtained transformed bacteria for every conditions made yesterday (except for controls).
Colonies of BL21 transformed with pcl_TAA and K1372001
Colonies of BL21 transformed with pcl_TAG and K1372001
Colonies of BL21 transformed with pcl_Tq and K1372001
We wanted to have glycerol stock of our transformed bacteria so we had to make a preculture. 3 clones of each conditions were put in 2mL of LB + Streptomycin (50µg/mL) + Chloramphenicol (30µg/mL) medium. They were incubated overnight at 37°C, 180 rpm.
