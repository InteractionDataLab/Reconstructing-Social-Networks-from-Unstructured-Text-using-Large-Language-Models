Q5 PCR on dCas9 ST - GFP 11 in pSB1C3, FRB in pJET and GFP 1.9 in pUC19
By Maxence & Mahnaz
Q5 PCR was performed on plasmids with the following protocol:
For each 50μl of reaction, mix the following reagents :
1 µL of plasmid
1 µL of dNTPs (10mM)
1 µL of each primer mix (10µM)
10 µL of Q5 buffer (5X)
0,5 µL of Q5 high fidelity polymerase
35,5 µL of nuclease free water
Mix gently and aliquot 50 μl of the mix into the PCR tubes on ice.  Perform PCR as follow:

PCR Clean-up of PCR products
By Maxence & Mahnaz
PCR products obtained were cleaned up by using the NucleoSpin Gel and PCR Clean-up kit protocol .

Gel of cleaned up PCR products
By Maxence & Mahnaz
After amplification, 3 µL of each cleaned up PCR products and 5 µL of DNA ladder were placed in wells and migrated at 100V during 30 min.
PCR products expected were :

Expected band size (bp)
GFP 11- pSB1C3

GFP 1.9
862
Result of the migration
No PCR products were obtained for GFP 1.9. Concerning FRB and GFP 11 - pSB1C3 amplification, good results were obtained and clones 9 for FRB and clone 8 for GFP 11 - pSB1C3 were selectionned.
Linearization of PCR product GFP 11 - pSB1C3 from clone 8
By Maxence & Mahnaz
PCR product GFP 11 - pSB1C3 has been linearized for further Gibson application by using DpnI treatment :
30 µL of cleaned up PCR product GFP 11 - pSB1C3
4 µL of fast digest buffer
1 µL of DpnI
5 µL of water
The mix was placed 10 minutes at 37°C and was cleaned by using the NucleoSpin Gel and PCR Clean-up kit protocol .
Transformation of DH5a cells with dCas9 NM - GFP 10 in PSB1C3 (pPS16_016) obtained by Gibson
By Maxence & Mahnaz
Dh5a cells were transformed with pSB1C3 containing dCas9 NM - GFP 10 (pPS16_016) (obtained by Gibson of fragment 1 PCR products (one with Q5 Pol and one with Phusion) + fragment 2 PCR products (one with Q5 Pol and one with Phusion) + pSB1C3), or containing control (no mix added when Gibson performed) using the usual protocol .
