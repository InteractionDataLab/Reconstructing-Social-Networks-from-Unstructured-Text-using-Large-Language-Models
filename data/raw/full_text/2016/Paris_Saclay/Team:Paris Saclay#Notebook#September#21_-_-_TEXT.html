Colony PCR of 16 clones containing corrected dCas9 ST - GFP 11 in pSB1C3 (pPS16_017)
By Maxence, Mahnaz & Coline
A colony PCR was done for 16 clones from the 20th September. For that purpose, 16 clones were screened and used for the usual protocol of Colony PCR. The same colonies were also plated on Petri dish containing solid LB + 30 µg/mL Cm and liquid cultures (LB + 30 µg/mL Cm) were made from these clones. Both petri dishes and liquid cultures were grown at 37°C.
For each clones contained in 20 μl water, 5.13 μL of the following mix were added :
2.5 µL DreamTaq Buffer
0.5 µL of dNTPs (10mM)
1 µL of each primer mix (10µM)
0.13 μl of DreamTaq Pol

Primers
iPS168 and iPS169
After amplification, 3 µL of each PCR products and 5 µL of DNA ladder were placed in wells and migrated at 100V during 30 min.
PCR products expected were :
