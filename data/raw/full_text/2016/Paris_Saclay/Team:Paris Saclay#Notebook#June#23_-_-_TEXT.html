Heat-shock competent cells
By Caroline and Lea
The cells competency was checked by transforming cells as usual with two control plasmids:
the Interlab study negative control
pSB1C3 blue
Interlab study
Transformation results
By Caroline, Lea and Marion
Colonies were observed for all transformations except for device 1 and positive control. The transformation was redone for device 1 with 5µL and the rest of the transformed cells obtained on 22/06/2016 were spread entirely.
Transformed cell cultures
By Lea
One colony from each transformation (device 2, device 3, negative control and positive control) obtained will be test in FACS. One colony for each was taken into 3.5mL LB medium + Cm at 30µg/mL.
