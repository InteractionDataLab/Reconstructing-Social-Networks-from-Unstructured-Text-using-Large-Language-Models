Ligation of gBlock 2.2
By Caroline and Lea
The size of the gBlock 2.2 is 808bp and the ratio was 11.69 (>7). gBlock was gently centrifugated and resuspended with 75µL of TE. The solution was then vortexed and stored at 50°C for 20 min. 1µL of ligase buffer, 1µL of ligase and 1µL of digested plasmids pUC19 were mixed with 7µL of gBlock 2.2. The resulting plasmid will be called pPS16_004.
2 control solutions were made:
1µL of digested plasmids pUC19 and 9µL of water
1µL of plasmid, 1µL of ligase and 1µL of water.
gBlocks transformation in DH5α
By Caroline and Lea
6 transformations were performed with the ligation products containing plasmids: pPS16_001, pPS16_002, pPS16_003, pPS16_005, pPS16_006 and pPS16_004 carried out on the morning. 3 other transformations were performed with plasmids pPS16_007, pPS16_008 and pPS16_009 extracted on 30/06/16. The transformation protocol was followed increasing plasmids quantities (5µL instead of 1µL). Afterward cells were spread on Petri dishes containing LB + Ampicillin (50µg/mL) + X-Gal + IPTG.
Digestion of plasmids
By Mathilde and Alice
The following plasmids were digested again with EcoRI and HindIII:
pPS16_001 (from the 6 clones that were selected on 29/06/16)
pPS16_003 (from the 6 clones that were selected on 29/06/16)
pPS16_005 (from the 6 clones that were selected on 29/06/16)
pPS16_006 (from the 6 clones that were selected on 29/06/16)

Plasmids extraction
By Naiane and Laetitia
The following plasmids were extracted using the "Charge Switch-Pro Plasmid Miniprep" kit:
DS-NMcas
DS-SPcasN-
DS-ST1casN-
DS-TDcasN-
Then plasmids were digested with AvrII :

BioBrick K1372001 characterization
Preparation of salycilate at 10 mM
By Charlène, Naiane and Léa
0.07g of salycilic acid was diluted in 50mL of water. The pH was adjusted to 7 with NaOH.
Culture of BL21
By Lea and Caroline
2 colonies from each Petri dish were grown in 500µL of LB, streptomycin (50µg/mL) and chloramphenicol (30µg/mL). Then each solution was split into 3x150µL and 350µL of LB + streptomycin (50µg/mL) + chloramphenicol (30µg/mL) were added to each culture. Salicylate (main solution at 10mM) was added to obtain the following concentrations :
