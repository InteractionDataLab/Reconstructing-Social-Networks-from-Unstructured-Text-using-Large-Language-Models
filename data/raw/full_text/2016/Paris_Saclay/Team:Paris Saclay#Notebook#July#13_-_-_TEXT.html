Bringing DNA closer
Glycerol stocks of DH5α transformed with DS-NMcas, DS-SPcasN-, DS-ST1casN- and DS-TDcasN-
By Laetitia
8 stocks were made: 2 clones (Cl 1 and Cl 2) by cas:
Cl1 and Cl2 of  DS-NMcas
Cl1 and Cl2 of  DS-SPcasN-
Cl1 and Cl2 of  DS-ST1casN-
Cl1 and Cl2 of  DS-TDcasN-
For 1 glycerol stock:
1mL of liquid culture
500 μL of glycerol 60%
Amplification of DS_SPcasN, DS_TDcasN, pZA21 and pZA31 by Phusion PCR
By Caroline
The different parts needed to the bring DNA closer tool were amplified by high fidelity PCR using Phusion following usual protocol with a TM at 60°C. Specific primers for these constructs were used to amplify. These primers will allow the Gibson assembly afterward : Ptet_R and Ptet_F for the plasmids, Link-TDdcas_F and Ter_TDdcas_R for DS_TDcasN, Tet-SPdcas_F and Link-SPdcas_R for DS_SPcasN.
Biobrick characterization
BL21 electrocompetent cells preparation and transformation
By Mathilde and Charlène
We did an electrotransformation of BL21 with :
pcl_TAA + K1372001 (time constant equal to 5.9ms)
pcl_TAG + K1372001 (time constant equal to 6 ms)
pcl_Tq + K1372001 (time constant equal to 6 ms)
Cells were spread on LB + Streptomycin (50µg/mL) + Chloramphenicol (30µg/mL) medium. For each condition, we made a Petri dish with 50µL of cells and another with 500µL of cells.

PCR of DH5$\alpha$α|pPS16_008 with Dream Taq and electrophoresis
By Laetitia
Preparation of the PCR mix (total of 200μL ):
20 μL of Dream Taq Green Buffer
20 μL of dNTP (10 mM)
8 μL of primer 1151 (10 mM)
8 μL of primer 1152 (10 mM)
1,04 μL of Dream Taq
142,96 μL of Nuclease free water
We divided up the PCR mix in 7 PCR tubes: put 25 μL of the mix in each tube.
For each tube (x7 different clones) : We picked 1 white clone in the petri dish containing DH5αlpPS16_008 (from 12/07/16) and soaked it in the tube (with PCR mix)
PCR was performed using this program  :
We used a TM at 57°C.
The products from the PCR were migrated on gel by electrophoresis during 20 min. We used the blue scale.
Culture of DH5α| pPS16_008 clones on petri dish
By Laetitia
We divided a Petri dish in 7 (for 7 clones from DH5αlpPS16_008). Just after putting the DH5αlpPS16_008 clone in the PCR tube, we spread the cells with the stick on the part corresponding to the clone on the petri dish.
We left it grow at room temperature.
High fidelity PCR on bacteria transformed with pPS16_007
By Alice
High fidelity PCR perfomed on the 12/07/16 did not give expected results. Thus high fidelity colony PCR is performed again on bacteria transformed with pPS16_007 following this protocol . 1151_pheoR and 1152_pheoF primers were used. Annealing temperature was 60°C. After amplification, 1 µL of loading dye was added to 5µL of each PCR products. Then 5 µL of this mix were put on gel. PCR products were migrated 30min at 100V.
PCR products expected were :
Plasmids
Band size (bp)
pPS16_007
763
No PCR products were observed.
Colony screening PCR on bacteria transformed with pPS16_004
By Alice and Caroline
Clones of bacteria transformed with pPS16_004 selected on the 11/07/16 did not grow on petri dishes. That why we performed again colony screening PCR on these bacteria. After transformation, only white bacteria were selected (blue/white screen). PCR with DreamTaq Polymerase was performed following this protocol . Clones selected for PCR were kept on LB+Amp+XGal(2µLXGal/1000µLH2O)+IPTG(2µLIPTG/1000µLH2O). Two primers ( 1151_pheoR and 1152_pheoF ) were used. Annealing temperature was 53°C. After amplification, 5 µL of each PCR products and 10 µL of DNA ladder were placed on gel and migrated at 100v during 30 min.
PCR products expected were:
Plasmids
Band size (bp)
pPS16_004
865
No PCR products were observed, despite the experiment was performed twice.
