PCR of the plasmid extraction from clonies 4,5,9,12 containing FRB sequence in pJET plasmid
By Mahnaz
2.5 µL DreamTaq Buffer
0.5 µL of dNTPs (10mM)
1 µL of each primer (10µM) primer pJET R and F
0.13 μl of DreamTaq Pol
20 µl H2O

After amplification, 3 µL of each PCR products and 5 µL of DNA ladder were placed in wells and migrated at 100V during 30 min.
PCR products expected were :

Expected band size (bp)
FRB in pJET
474
Result of migration
The expected size was 474 pb and the 4 plasmids were sent to sequencing.
Samples preparation for sequencing
by Mahnaz
15 µL of plasmides plasmids coding FRB from colonies 4,5,9 and 12 were sent to be sequenced. 20 µL of the primers pJET F (5µM) and pJET R (5µM) were sent for sequencing.
