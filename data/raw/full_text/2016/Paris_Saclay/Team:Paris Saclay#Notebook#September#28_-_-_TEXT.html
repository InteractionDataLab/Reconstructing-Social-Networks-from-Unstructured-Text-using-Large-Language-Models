PCR of extracted FKBP - GFP 10 in pSB1C3 (pPS16_018)
By Maxence & Mahnaz
In order to verify if extracted plasmids contain FKBP - GFP 10, a PCR was run with iPS168 & iPS169 to amplify the insert. For that purpose, plasmids extracted today (clones 4, 7, 10 & 11 for 2 fragments Gibson and clones 2, 4, 4 & 6 for 3 fragments Gibson) were used.
For each 50μl of reaction, mix the following reagents :
1 µL of matrix
1 µL of dNTPs (10mM)
2.5 µL of each primer mix (10µM)
10 µL of buffer (5X)
0,5 µL of Phusion polymerase
32.5 µL of nuclease free water
Mix gently and aliquot 50 μl of the mix into the PCR tubes on ice.  Perform PCR as follow:

By Maxence & Mahnaz
In order to verify if extracted plasmids contain GFP 1.9, a PCR was run with iPS168 & iPS169 to amplify the insert. For that purpose, plasmids extracted the 27th Sepembter (clones 3, 4, 7 and 8) were used.
