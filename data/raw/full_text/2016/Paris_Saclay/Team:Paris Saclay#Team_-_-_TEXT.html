About the team
Are you searching for the dream team of your life? Search no longer!
Our team is composed of 20 skillful and brilliant students from several fields. In Paris Saclay's team you can find biologist students from Paris-Sud University, AgroParisTech, ENS (Ecole Normale Supérieur) and the Institut Villebon. We also have computer scientists, bioinformatitians, physicians and for the very first time we have a couple of lovely law students!
The team would never have seen the light of the day without the help of our talented advisors, PhD students and researchers from the Institute for Integrative Biology of the Cell (I2BC).
Like the beginning of every love story we didn’t really knew each other that well, but we spend the best year and summer of our lives together. Our expertise in many fields and cohesion are our strength and it helped us built the I’JAIME project. We all had the chance to experience and learn something new and rewarding. Being part of this team asked commitment, organization and every problem had a solution because we never stop believing in our project.
Our mascot
Crispy is an E. coli matchmaker. He will not rest until he has "matched" every lonely DNA molecule to another.
