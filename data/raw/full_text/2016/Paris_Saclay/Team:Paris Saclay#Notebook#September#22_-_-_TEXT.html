Colony PCR of 8 clones containing FRB - GFP 11 - GFP 1.9 in pSB1C3 (pPS16_022)
By Maxence, Mahnaz & Coline
A colony PCR was done for 8 clones (4 clones with GFP 1.9 PCR product obtained with DMSO and 4 clones with GFP 1.9 PCR product obtained without DMSO) from the 20th September. For that purpose, 8 clones were screened and used for the usual protocol of Colony PCR. The same colonies were also plated on Petri dish containing solid LB + 30 µg/mL Cm and liquid cultures (LB + 30 µg/mL Cm) were made from these clones. Both petri dishes and liquid cultures were grown at 37°C.
For each clones contained in 20 μl water, 5.13 μL of the following mix were added :
2.5 µL DreamTaq Buffer
0.5 µL of dNTPs (10mM)
1 µL of each primer mix (10µM)
0.13 μl of DreamTaq Pol
PCR was performed as follow:

Colony PCR of 12 clones containing FKBP - GFP 10 in pSB1C3 (pPS16_019)
By Maxence, Mahnaz & Coline
As sequencing results were not convincing, a new colony PCR was done for 12 clones from the 15th September (8 new clones and the 4 sent for sequencing) but with primers iPS168 & iPS169. For that purpose, 12 were screened and used for the usual protocol of Colony PCR. The same colonies were also plated on Petri dish containing solid LB + 30 µg/mL Cm and liquid cultures (LB + 30 µg/mL Cm) were made from these clones. Both petri dishes and liquid cultures were grown at 37°C.
For each clones contained in 20 μl water, 5.13 μL of the following mix were added :

PCR on cleaned up PCR products FKBP from 8th September and gblock 2.2 from the 8th September in order to fuse fuse these fragments
By Maxence, Manhaz & Coline
As sequencing and colony PCR of clones containing FKBP - GFP 10 in pSB1C3 did not show good results, a new clonage strategy was performed: before the Gibson, the two inserts were fused together by PCR. So PCR was performed with cleaned up PCR products FKBP (obtained the 8th September) and claned up PCR product gblock 2.2 (obtained the 8th September) with the following protocol.
For each 50μl of reaction, mix the following reagents :
1 µL of each PCR product
1 µL of dNTPs (10mM)
2 µL of each primer mix (10µM)
10 µL of buffer (5X)
0,5 µL of Phusion polymerase
32.5 µL of nuclease free water
Mix gently and aliquot 50 μl of the mix into the PCR tubes on ice.  Perform PCR as follow:

Clean-up of PCR products from gel

The PCR products were cleaned up from the gel by using the NucleoSpin Gel and PCR Clean-up kit protocol . Their concentrations were assessed by NanoDrop:
