Josh Atkinson
4th Year Graduate Student/PhD Candidate in Systems, Synthetic, and Physical Biology
Josh Atkinson, a Michigan native and lover of cats, is a 4th year Systems, Synthetic, and Physical Biology graduate student. He can be seen in habitats such as the Silberg Lab in Keck Hall or any local establishment selling craft beer (i.e. Valhalla, the graduate student pub also located in Keck Hall). Outside of Rice, Josh enjoys hiking and being an adventurer whose skill level is between that of Dora the Explorer and Indiana Jones. Most importantly, Josh was part of the 2012 University of Michigan iGEM team.
George Britton
3rd Year PhD Student in Systems, Synthetic and Physical Biology
George Britton is a third year Systems, Synthetic and Physical Biology PhD student. As a mountain man living in a concrete jungle, George seeks adventure whenever not the lab. He was bitten by the travel bug as a child and continually adds passport stamps and experiences.
Carlos Bueno
Graduate Student in System, Synthetic and Physical Biology
Carlos is a graduate student in System, Synthetic and Physical Biology. He is interested in Theoretical Biophysics and he would like to create strange proteins one day. Meanwhile, he likes learning about wet lab techniques and helping the iGEM team with the pathway models.
Ilenne Del Valle
2nd Year Graduate Student in the System, Synthetic and Physical Biology
Ilenne is a second year graduate student in the System, Synthetic and Physical Biology program. She is from Santiago, Chile and participated in iGEM in 2013. In the lab she works on designing biosensors to measure biogeochemical processes in soil bacteria. No matter how busy, she is always reading a new book. Her dream is to backpack around the whole world (so far, she has only made it to US and couple of countries in South America).
David Zong
3rd Year Graduate Student in the Systems, Synthetic, and Physical Biology
David Zong is a third year graduate student in the Systems, Synthetic, and Physical Biology program. David is from Seattle, Washington and went to The University of Washington for his undergrad. There he was a member of the Washington iGEM team from 2010 to 2013. This is his second year advising iGEM at Rice. When not in lab, he enjoys watching the Seattle Mariners wallow in mediocrity...except when they play the Astros or Rangers because of MLB.tv blackout restrictions in the state of Texas. C'mon MLB.
