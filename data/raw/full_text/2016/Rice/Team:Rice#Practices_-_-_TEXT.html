Overview
Our team engaged in activities that focused on the public perception of our projectâ€™s application. It is particularly important for us to address the significant concerns that arise regarding the ethicality and safety of synthetic biology considering that our long term ambition is for our E. colinoscopies to become part of a new standard of universal diagnostic techniques. We sought out feedback from stakeholders, engaged the public in interactive debate, and led significant educational initiatives.

Public Education: Building with Biology
