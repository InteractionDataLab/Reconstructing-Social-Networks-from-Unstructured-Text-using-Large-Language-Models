Safe Organisms
E.coli (MG1655)
Risk Group: Group 1
Source: Acquired from the Silberg Lab at Rice University
Warning: Potentially harmful when inhaled or swallowed. Can cause eye and skin irritation in rare cases.
Use: As a chassis for experiments and cloning
E.coli (BL21 Rosetta)
Risk Group: Group 1
Source: Acquired from the Silberg Lab at Rice University
Warning: Potentially harmful when inhaled or swallowed. Can cause eye and skin irritation in rare cases.
Use: As a chassis for experiments and cloning
Safe Project Design
Biological safety is a priority, especially considering that a product derived from our project would be used within the human gastrointestinal tract.
Considerations Derived from Human Practices
After speaking with physicians in the Texas Medical Center , as well as generally introducing our project to various peers and faculty, we began to consider biosafety measures (which were previously outside the scope of testing our sensory constructs), such as a kill switch.
Safety Training Courses
This yearâ€™s wetlab team members received safety training from Rice Environmental Health & Safety (EHS). The courses are as follows:
General Laboratory Safety
Blood Safety and Blood Borne Pathogens
The link to the laboratory safety training requirements of our institution can be found here .
