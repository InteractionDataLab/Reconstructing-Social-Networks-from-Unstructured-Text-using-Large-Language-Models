Software: Zap-It
The “Zap-It” is an educational game about photoacoustic imaging. The player has a gun that can focus in one direction and shoot a particle only at certain wavelengths to make the particle explode. Then the player must collect the emissions of the particle to gain points. This simulates real photoacoustic imaging in which particles excited by the right wavelength of light will emit another light wave that can read by an ultrasound machine. These particles can be contrast agents used in imaging blood vessels because heme is a natural contrast agent. Our team specifically uses the technology to image gut inflammation.
