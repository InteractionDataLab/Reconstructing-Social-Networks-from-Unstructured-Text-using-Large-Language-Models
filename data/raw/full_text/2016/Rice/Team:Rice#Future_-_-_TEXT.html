Future Directions
Further development into the assembly of invasion; the analysis of why the protocol to assemble this part did not work is not clear.
After mammalian cell culture proves product [bacteria + sensors] to be working, it will be interesting to test bacteria in a more advanced organism (i.e rat). This will provide a good, more comprehensive test as to whether the bacteria can truly detect gut inflammation as it will introduce some of factors present in the human gut.
Do some research into therapeutic pathways with our bacteria; we can use our bacteria to deliver medication to certain cells and stray away from just the diagnostic application. Additionally, we can look into the therapeutic properties of violacein in cancer.
