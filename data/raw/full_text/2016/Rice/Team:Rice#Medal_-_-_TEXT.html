Register and Attend
Register for iGEM, have a great summer, and attend the Giant Jamboree.
Our team is registered for participate in this iGEM's Giant Jamboree this year, and this past summer was pretty "lit"!
Deliverables
Team Wiki/poster/presentation; judging and safety forms
We’re excited for the presentation and poster sessions, and our wiki content is in order! Finally, the judging and safety ( Check-in , About Our Lab , About Our Project , and Final Safety Form ) forms are done, and done!
Attributions
Create a page on your team wiki with clear attribution of each aspect of your project. This page must clearly attribute work done by the students and distinguish it from work done by others, including host labs, advisors, instructors, sponsors, professional website designers, artists, and commercial services.
Please refer to our attributions , where we list the contributions of those who have made Rice iGEM possible.
Part/Contributions
Document at least one new standard BioBrick Part or Device central to your project and submit this part to the iGEM Registry (submissions must adhere to the iGEM Registry guidelines). You may also document a new application of a BioBrick part from a previous iGEM year, adding that documentation to the part main page.
Please refer to our submitted parts to look at all BioBrick Parts we have submitted.
Silver Medal Requirement
Validated Part
Experimentally validate that at least one new BioBrick Part or Device of your own design and construction works as expected. Document the characterization of this part in the Main Page section of that Part’s/Device’s Registry entry. Submit this new part to the iGEM Parts Registry.
We characterized our composite constructs BBa_K1878002 and BBa_K1878003 , and verified that they work as intended.
Collaboration
Convince the judges you have helped any registered iGEM team from high school, a different track, another university, or another institution in a significant way by, for example, mentoring a new team, characterizing a part, debugging a construct, modeling/simulating their system or helping validate a software/hardware solution to a synbio problem.
You can refer to the collaborators page to learn of our exchanges with UT Austin, Texas Tech, HKUST, and Michigan!
Human Practices
iGEM projects involve important questions beyond the lab bench, for example relating to (but not limited to) ethics, sustainability, social justice, safety, security, and intellectual property rights. Demonstrate how your team has identified, investigated, and addressed one or more of these issues in the context of your project. Your activity could center around education, public engagement, public policy issues, public perception, or other activities (see the human practices hub for more information and examples of previous teams' exemplary work).
Please refer to the Overview page of our Human Practices to check out our activities for public engagement and education, as well as engagement with stakeholders who may be interested in our project!
Gold Medal Requirement
Integrated Human Practices
Expand on your silver medal activity by demonstrating how you have integrated the investigated issues into the design and/or execution of your project.
After reaching out to physicians in the Texas Medical Center , our team conceived of new design considerations for our project regarding short term construct design, long term product application and delivery, and general feasibility.
Improve a Previous Part or Project
Improve the function OR characterization of an existing BioBrick Part or Device and enter this information in the Registry. Please see the Registry help page on how to document a contribution to an existing part. This part must NOT be from your 2016 part number range.
We discovered that the modified NarK’s ( BBa_K239006 ) characterization deviated from results featured in previous iGEM Wikis.
