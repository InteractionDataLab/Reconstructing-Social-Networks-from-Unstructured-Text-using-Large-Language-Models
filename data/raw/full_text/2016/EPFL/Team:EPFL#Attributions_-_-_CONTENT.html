                            Our iGEM journey started at the end of 2015 when EPFL students were invited to join in the 2016 iGEM team. After the selection, we started brainstorming in February 2016 where after a few months of literature research we came up with this project of combining CRISPR-dCas9 and the Cello software. Between the beginning of June and July, we designed and ordered all the parts we needed. And then finally, in July, we were able to start our exciting work in the lab! And we have been working hard ever since then to present our end results to all the other teams and jury members end of October in Boston, MA.
