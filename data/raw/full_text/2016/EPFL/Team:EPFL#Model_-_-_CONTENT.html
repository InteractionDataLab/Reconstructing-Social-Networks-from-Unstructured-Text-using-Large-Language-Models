                            In order to be able to predict the output and reliability of each biological circuit, Cello requires that 
                            each gate have a defined response function, that predicts the output of that gate’s output promoter based 
                            on the strength of the input promoters. Since many of our gates are modifiable and would not rely on the 
                            simple “tandem promoter” architecture that Cello uses, gate response functions would have to be predicted 
                            based on the response functions of individual parts, when they are not known. Since each part has the same

In addition, it may be interesting to note here that the binding of dCas9 to its target DNA occurs more often than Cas9 to the same target, and that the binding of dCas9 to a promoter is proportional to the basal activity of that promoter (Farasat &amp; Sallis, 2016). The on-rate can be affected by the presence of other dCas9-gRNA-PEM complexes bound near
                                    the target site, although there is steric hindrance immediately next to the target site when dCas9 is bound, there is also a supercoiling effect, since the dCas9 unwinds the DNA at its target site, increasing the tension in the DNA nearby, making it more difficult for other dCas9s to similarly open the DNA. Close to the target site this effect is additive and linear in terms of the change in binding energy, but becomes unimportant at a distance of about 200bp from the target site (Farasat &amp; Sallis, 2016). 
                                     Before we can model the proportion of the bound promoter we must consider how the on- and off- rates of the DNA-dCas9-gRNA-PEM complex will be affected by this supercoiling.

                                    Because of the exponential relationships that exists between binding energy and on- and off- rates, 
                                    the relationship between the on-rate of the DNA-dCas9-gRNA-PEM complex can be described as a function of 
                                    the on-rate in the absence of supercoiling, and the change in energy in the presence of supercoiling. 
                                    
                                    The factor by which the on- and off- rates change can be described by the following equation: 
                                    $$e^\frac{-ΔG_{supercoiling}}{k_b T}$$
                                    
                                    We also know that the average amount of supercoiling in the yeast genome is -0.05 (Roca, 2011), and that n=23. We therefore have the following
                                    relationship between the on-rate of the DNA-dCas9-gRNA-PEM-PEM complex when we account for supercoiling and the original:

                                    Practically, since we know that the affinity of binding is very high between dCas9-gRNA-PEM and the target 
                                    DNA, even very low concentrations of dCas9-gRNA-PEM will suffice to drive \(P_B \rightarrow 1\). When supercoiling in the DNA 
                                    exceeds a certain point, the tension in the DNA double helix will drive the off-rates of the targets to

Therefore, the response function of a gate can extrapolated from the response functions of the component 
                            parts by determining whether the output of one part is sufficiently high to “trigger” the next part. If it is, the next part is considered to be “on”, and so on and so forth. If 
                            the output of the gate is not sufficiently high, the next part will be in an “off” state. </P><P class="sub-lead text-justify">As most gates combine multiple inputs, there are certain parts which will have multiple inputs. In the case of parts where the multiple inputs have the same 
                            function, the effects can be additive and the threshold higher. For example for a system where two products \(G\) and \(H\) would go on to form a complex that would activate another promoter, 
                            if the concentrations of \(G\) and \(H\) would be additively too low to turn the promoter on, then 
                            we would consider their effective concentrations to be null. They could even act differently on the promoter, which could be modeled by giving them two different parameters: and , 
                            for example. Written mathematically: </P><P class="sub-lead text-justify">If the effectors are repressors:
                            $$ G,H = \begin{cases}
                                        \text{consider G,H = 0 in next steps}, &amp; q_G G+q_H H \leq t_{off} \\

                             In the case when transcriptional activators and repressors act on the same promoter, we consider that the repressor beats the activator, so we consider only the effect of the repressor. This has been reported in the literature (Gilbert et al., 2014) and we also confirmed it experimentally in our project.

                            model involves the identification of the parameters. After identifying the \(t_{on}\) and \(t_{off}\) rates of the circuit 
                            output promoters, these values can be mapped onto the promoters one step earlier in the circuit to give \( t_{off}^{'} \) 
                            and \( t_{on}^{'} \). These values represent the activation of the promoters directly before the aforementioned output 
                            promoters necessary to ensure the “on” and “off” states of these promoters. This method is repeated throughout 
                            the circuit until these values are identified for the input promoters to the circuit. At this point input values 
                            lower than these lower threshold values identified for the input promoters will represent 0 – or negative - inputs, 
                            and input values higher than the upper threshold values will represent 1 – or positive inputs. We have not yet had 
                            an opportunity to integrate this model into our database to generate response functions for our gates, but (time 
                            permitting), we will do this after wikifreeze!
