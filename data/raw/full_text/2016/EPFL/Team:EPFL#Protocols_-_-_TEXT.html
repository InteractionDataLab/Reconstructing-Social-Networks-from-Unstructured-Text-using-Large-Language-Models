Protocols
Single Colony Streaks
Materials
Glycerol stock or culture of the desired bacteria
Bunsen burner
Inoculation loop
Plate with correct selection
Procedure
Put on the Bunsen burner and always work in the sterile environment it provides.
Heat the loop to red hot and cool it down on the edge of the plate until it doesn’t fizz or melt the agar anymore.
Dip the loop into the glycerol stock or the culture.
Draw 4 to 6 lines on the top of the plate.
Sterilize the loop by putting it into the flame until red hot. Don’t dip the loop in the glycerol stock or culture again!
Start from the end of the first lines and draw 4 to 6 additional lines in the same manner as step 4.
Repeat the operation 3 times until you form a shape similar to a pentagon on the plate. Be careful to always flame between the different streaks!
Incubate the plates overnight at 37°C.
Spreading cells
Materials
culture of cells
Bunsen burner
Spreader or autoclaved glass beads
Plate with correct selection
Procedure
Put on the Bunsen burner and always work in the sterile environment it provides.
Place the relevant volume of culture in the center of the plates, usually 200 ul for bacteria.
If you are working with a  spreader, remove it from alcohol and let it drain briefly.
Pass the spreader through the pilot flame.
Open the plate and check that the spreader is not too hot by pressing it against the agar on the edge of the plate and waiting until it doesn’t fizz or melt the agar anymore.
Spread the liquid all over the plate while avoiding that all the liquid end up at the edge of the plate.
Replace the lid and replace the spreader in alcohol.
If you are working with glass beads, don’t take into consideration steps 2 to 4 : pour the clean beads on the plate, replace the lid and spread the liquid by shaking the plate in a circular motion.
Put the glass beads back in a bottle and send for autoclaving.
Incubate the plates upside down to avoid condensation to fall on the growing cells at the appropriate temperature for as long as required by the organism.
PCR
Materials
Thermocycler
DNA polymerase Q5 (NEB)
5X Q5 Reaction Buffer (NEB)
10 uM forward and reverse primers
10 mM dNTPs
Template DNA
Nuclease-free water
Procedure
In 0,2 ml PCR tubes on ice, add 5 ul Q5 reaction buffer, 0.5 ul dNTPs, 1.25 ul of each primer, 1 ng of template DNA and fill the tube up to 24.75 ul with nuclease-free water. For negative control, add everything to the tube apart from the template DNA.
Before adding the polymerase, make sure to have an appropriate PCR program already set up on the thermocycler. If not, follow these guidelines:
Initial denaturation is performed at 98°C for 30 sec, and denaturation during the cycles is also at 98°C for about 10 sec.
Annealing temperature depends on the primer sequence and should be determined using NEB Tm calculator and choosing the right polymerase (Q5), buffer (Q5) and primer concentration (500 nM). Annealing time is around 10 to 30 sec, 10 sec if the annealing temperature is low, and 30 if it is high
Extension time is performed at 72°C and is around 30 sec per kb. To be sure extension is complete, increase a bit the final extension time. Final extension is also at 72°C for 5 min.
Number of cycles is normally 25 to 35.
Add 0.25 ul of the Q5 polymerase, flick and spin down shortly the tubes.
Put the tubes in the thermocycler previously pre-heated and start the program.
When the program is finished, run a gel with the PCR products to check that the PCR worked and store at 4°C.
PCR purification
Materials
PCR product
QIAquick spin column
Microcentrifuge
PB buffer
PE buffer (ethanol added)
EB buffer
Procedure
Add 5 volume of PB buffer to 1 volume of PCR product and mix well.
If pH indicator was added to the PB buffer, the solution should be yellow. If the solution is orange or violet, add 10 ul 3M sodium acetate pH 5 and mix. The color will turn yellow.
Apply the sample to the QIAquick spin column and centrifuge for 60 sec at 13’000 rpm. DIscard the flow-through and put the column back in the collection tube.
Wash the column by adding 750 ul PE buffer to the column and centrifuge again for 60 sec. Discard the flow through and put the column back in the collection tube.
To remove all wash buffer, centrifuge for 1 more min.
Place the column in a clean 1.5 ml centrifuge tube.
For elution of bound DNA, apply 50 ul EB buffer to the center of the membrane of the column. Centrifuge for 1 min.
Run a gel to check that the purification was successful and determine the concentration of your sample with a Nanodrop for further
PCR Colony
Materials
Thermocycler
Taa polymerase
10X Thermopol reaction buffer (NEB)
10 uM forward and reverse primers
10 mM dNTPs
Plates with colony of interest
Nuclease-free water
Procedure
If no previous colony PCR program has been set, follow these guidelines to create one before starting:
Initial denaturation is performed at 95°C for 7 min, and denaturation during the cycles is also at 95°C for about 30 sec.
Annealing temperature depends on the primer sequence and should be determined using NEB Tm calculator and choosing the right polymerase (Taq), buffer (Thermopol) and primer concentration (200 nM). Annealing time is about 1 min.
Extension time is performed at 68°C and is around 1 min per kb. To be sure extension is complete, increase a bit the final extension time. Final extension is also at 68°C for 5 min.
Number of cycles is normally 35.
Working on ice, prepare a MasterMix containing for each PCR reaction :
2.5 ul of reaction buffer
0.5 ul of each primer
0.125 of polymerase
20.875 ul water
Distribute 24 ul MasterMix in each tube and label them from 1 to the number of reaction performed.
Number every colony that will be picked.
Under the flame, pick half of one colony and put it in the tube with the same number. Repeat the operation until every colony has been picked.
Flick and spin down shortly the samples before putting them into the thermocycler previously pre-heated. Start the corresponding program.
Run a gel with PCR products to check that the PCR colony went right and that the plasmid is present in the bacteria.
Gibson Assembly
Materials
Gibson master mix from NEB 2X
DNA fragments
Deionized Water
Procedure
Take 100 ng of vector plasmid and add a ratio between 1:3 and 1:6 of insert in pmol. To do so, first calculate the number of pmol that corresponds to 100 ng of vector with the following formula : 100 (mass of vector) * 1000 / (650 * number of nt of the vector). Then multiply by the ratio to have the number of pmol of the insert and convert this number back in ng with this formula : pmol of insert * 650 * number of nt of the insert / 1000.
Add 10 ul of gibson assembly master mix and complete the reaction with water until 20 ul.
Put the samples for one hour at 50°C.
Integrate directly in competent bacteria or store at -20°C until doing so.

Restriction Enzymes Digestion
Materials
Restriction enzyme
10X enzyme buffer
DNA of interest
Water
Heating block
Procedure
Take the appropriate amount of DNA of interest, depending on what it will be used for. For a regular restriction enzyme analysis, take 1 ug. For integration in yeasts, take between 1 and 4 ug.
Add 5 ul of enzyme buffer.
Calculate how much of restriction enzyme is required, knowing that 1U of enzyme is needed to digest 1 ug of DNA in 1 hour at 37°C.
Fill the reaction to 50 ul minus the amount of enzyme needed.
Heat the heating block to 37°C (or the temperature required by the enzyme).
When the heating block is ready, add the enzyme to the reaction and let  incubate at the appropriate temperature for 15 min (if enzyme is Time-Saver qualified by NEB) or 1 hour.
Put on ice to stop the digestion and run a gel with the digested sample next to the undigested one to check that the digestion worked.
Yeast Integration
Step 1: Making Competent yeasts
Materials
Appropriate medium for yeasts (selective or non-selective, depending on the strain)
Plated yeast strain
Glucose 40%
dH2O
10X TE buffer (100mM Tris, 10mM EDTA, pH 8.0)
1M LiAc
Salmon sperm DNA (ssDNA)
DMSO
Spectrophotometer
Centrifuge
Procedure
Day 1
At 15:00 approximately, start pre-culture by making a solution of yeast medium and glucose 40 % : put 2.5 mL of glucose in an erlenmeyer and add 47.5 mL of medium with one big colony of the plated yeasts.
Let the preculture grow overnight at 30°C on a shaker.
Day 2
At 11:00, check the OD of preculture by measuring absorbance at 600nm with a spectrophotometer.
If the absorbance is between 1.6 and 1.8, seed yeast in medium and add glucose as such : 450 mL YEP  + 25 mL 40 % glucose + 25 mL of pre-culture. If not, seed enough preculture in the new medium to have a final OD around 0.15-0.2 and a total volume of 500 mL.
Grow at 30°C with a shake for about 3h until OD of the culture is 0.6-0.8.
Meanwhile, if using a non-wild type strain, prepare the selective plates on which the yeasts will be plated according to their specific marker.
Spin yeasts down for 5’ at 1800 rpm by splitting the culture into 50 mL tubes. Pour off medium and check that the medium is clear. If not, you may have a bacterial contamination.
Wash yeast with 25 mL of dH2O. Resuspend and pool the two tubes together.
Spin yeast down 5’ at 1800 rpm.
Wash yeasts with 10 mL TE/LiAc. To make TE/LiAc, add 1 part of LiAc to 1 part of TE and 8 parts water.
Spin yeasts down 5’ at 1800 rpm.
Resuspend yeast in TE/LiAc solution according to the following formula : OD600 x culture volume /60 = volume in which to resuspend in ml. When resuspending the cells, be extracareful and never suck up the cell pellet. This step is critical for the success of the integration.
Add 10%vol of ssDNA, previously boiled at 100°C for 5’ and cooled on ice.
To freeze yeast, add 10% of the final volume of DMSO and put at -80°C. Aliquot by 250𝜇L and put paper around each tube in a styrofoam rack.

If you want to perform a double digestion as a further control, mix 0.5𝜇g of plasmid, 0.5𝜇l of each enzyme, 5𝜇l of buffer and water until reaching a final volume of 50𝜇l.
Note: check that both enzymes work in the same buffer. Otherwise, choose the best compromise for both enzymes.

Add the 4 𝜇g of linearized vector to the yeasts.
Make a solution of 1ml of TE, 1 ml of lithium acetate and 8ml of PEG.
Add 1ml of the solution and resuspend by pipetting up and down very carefully. This step is critical for the success of the integration.
