intelligene.plus
A Handy Database for Genetic Gates, Parts, and scRNAs
Although research around the creation of dCas9-based gate designs is exploding,                              finding these new gate structures can be surprisingly difficult, as they are                              often scurried away in papers or projects for competitions like iGEM. To combat                              this issue, we decided to create a database of dCas9-based logic gate designs. In                              this database, the logic gates are described in terms of their parts - such as                              promoters, terminators, and ribozymes - instead of just simple DNA sequences.                              Parts can be easily added to the database through beautiful forms. intelligene.plus                             features intuitive tools to allow users to create new gate designs and attribute                              different functions to different areas of parts such as promoters, allowing complex                             interactions within gates.
Just as Cello seeks to democratize circuit design, intelligene.plus seeks to                              democratize gate design. In order to allow programs like Cello to pick up these                              new gate designs, APIs are available that allow these programs to retrieve data                              from our databases.
Design
intelligene.plus is made to communicate directly with Cello ,                             a program which automates synthetic genetic network design. As such, when a request is made to                              it through its API, it returns an appropriate list of gates, based on the required number of gates                              for the circuit and user specifications, in the form of a JSON file. This JSON file contains all                              of the necessary information for Cello to operate correctly, including: the construction of each                              gate in terms of its parts, the sequences of each part, the response functions of each gate, and                             a list of “associated parts” which are common to multiple gates. To understand how intelligene.plus                             is able to return this data file, it is important to understand the structure of data in the                              website. Although we refer to intelligene.plus as a single MySQL database, it is really more                              important to think of it as a collection of databases. Various types of parts are divided amongst                              these databases. When it is time to retrieve parts from the databases, the gate templates are used                             to rummage through the databases of each part type and fetch the correct number of each type of                              part to build the necessary gates. Although at the time of wikifreeze, we have not yet integrated                              methods into the database to create response functions for the generated gates, you can find a                              model that we have elucidated to do just this here . Time permitting,                             we will integrate this functionality after wikifreeze.
Features
User interface
In line with our goal of making dCas9-based gate technology as easy as possible to                              use, our user interface is remarkably simple. Buttons on the side-bar allow you to                              create standard parts of different types. Once these parts are on the workbench,                              they can be dragged-and-dropped so that the user can rearrange them as they wish.                              The possible relationships between parts include their genetic order and transcriptional                             activation or repression. These relationships can be defined by the users through                              dragging-and-dropping links between the parts.
Part Forms
When selecting the parts that have to be used for each gate                              two options are given: users can choose parts that have already                              been submitted to the database, or they may choose to submit new                              parts. In the case of submitting new parts, the relevant entry                              information is prompted by neat forms. This information generally                              includes, but is not limited, to the name and sequence of the part.
Sequence Highlighter
In the case of promoters, multiple functional areas may exist. For example, certain regions of the promoter may be known to be particularly effective                              targets for repression, and others for activation. In addition, some areas                              may be known to be able to modified, without changing the function of the                              promoter. We have a developed a fun tool with a clean design which helps                              users define these regions in new promoters. By dragging the cursor over                              certain areas of the promoter, these areas can be defined as activating,                              repressing, or variable regions.
Gate designer: Saving Elements
Once parts are submitted through the user interface, they are immediately uploaded                              to the database. After this point they can be suggested to users when they search                              for the part again.
Gate designer: APIs
intelligene.plus comes with handy APIs, which can be used to call the database from an external source, such as an application like Cello.

Technical specifications
System requirements
The software can run on almost any web server featuring PHP & MySQL.
More specifically, it runs on the LAMP platform. This means your web server (or web hosting account) should be featured with the following software: Linux + Apache + MySQL + PHP.
For all practical purposes, it will run on the vast majority of current web hosting offers.
Software Requirements
Your web server / web hosting account should have the following software versions:
Linux: any modern distribution will work.
On shared hosting accounts, you should not even need to worry about this.
For dedicated servers, we like to use CentOS but RedHat, Debian and others will work just as well.
Note: it is possible to run the software on Windows, especially for development. This is not an officially supported platform though and we do not recommend it for production servers, especially regarding performance & security.
Note: running on Mac OS X works fine, especially with a package like MAMP.
Apache: version 2.0 or above.
Note: it is possible to run intelligene.plus on Lighttpd or NginX but these are not officially supported configurations and will likely require manual configuration as these servers will not read our .htaccess File .
MySQL: version 5.0.3 or above.
InnoDB MUST be enabled (All decent web hosts offer InnoDB)
Note: At this point we do not believe that database abstraction is a practical proposition.
PHP: version 5.2 or above. No additional requirements.
Installation
Just download the code from here and put it on a server.                              Dump the database ( link ) and then load the index.php.
Note that intelligene.plus can be used with no downloads/installations required at www.intelligene.plus .
