Build your own bioware? It's simple
Engineering your cells with new biological circuits                              can give them incredible capacities, but can also be a painstaking endeavor.                             Intelligene is suite of tools meant to fix just that.
Synthetic genetic networks are being used more and more frequently in synthetic                              biology due to their ability to give cells powerful new capabilities while using                              many of the techniques already common to cell cloning, such as assembly strategies                             and transformation. Designing the biological organization these circuits, which                              are often built into plasmid vectors, can be a real challenge. Cello,                              published in Science on April 1st, 2016, is a program which allows users to                              combine data of the desired circuit and data about the host system to generate plasmids                             containing the fully functional circuits. Over the summer, we developed a suite of                              software tools meant to increase the user-friendliness, open-source nature, and                              power of Cello. This required modifying Cello in multiple ways. Firstly, we                              added an intuitive user interface to Cello to design circuits, eliminating the                              need for users to understand how to code in Verilog. Secondly, we made Cello                              accept external inputs, so it could download biological parts from a database.                              Thirdly, we created and published this database, complete with a variety of                              features to allow users to interact with the database. Past wiki freeze, we                              plan to continue working on integration of the database with Cello to allow                              the seamless transfer of information, and the correct interpretation of the                              available data.
