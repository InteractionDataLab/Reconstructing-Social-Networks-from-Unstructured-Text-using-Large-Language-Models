                            Our project aimed to build modular biological logic gates in yeast, by exploiting  a dCas9-based system. Therefore, we decided to simulate a biological ON/OFF state, like in an electrical system where the ON state corresponds to the current flow and the OFF state to the absence of current. To achieve this goal, we assembled fundamental parts for the  control of gene expression: an activator for the ON state and a repressor for the OFF state. We used Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) as a reporter gene to assess the correct behaviour of our basic effector modules. Measurements were taken by performing overnight photospectroscopy (or, overnight plate reader) and using Fluorescence-Activated Cell Sorting (FACS).

                            The endogenous promoter Tef1 was shown to be repressed in yeast by fusing dCas9 with the strong chromatin remodeler Mxi1 (Gilbert et al., 2013). In light of this finding, we designed a repressor system based on a scRNA carrying the well-characterized viral RNA sequence PP7 (scTef1_PP7, <A target="_blank" href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K1941001">BBa_K1941001</A>). The sequence PP7 is recognized by the PCP RNA-binding protein (Chao et al., 2007) at which we fused the transcriptional repressor domain Mxi1 (<B>Fig. 2A</B>). Furthermore, we made another version of scTef1_PP7, equipped with an additional hairpin that recruits a second repressor module (scTef1_2PP7, <A target="_blank" href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K1941002">BBa_K1941002</A>).

Additionally, we observed that scTef1_2PP7 did not repress Tef1 promoter more efficiently than scTef1_PP7. We therefore used the simpler system with the single hairpin PP7 in further experiments.

                            Every system that takes an INPUT and returns an OUTPUT is characterized by a “time response”: an interval of time for which the response is transient i.e. it is not at steady state. In electrical engineering, the transient state of the system remains for a very short time while steady-state is the stage of the system as time t approaches infinity. We can extrapolate this definition to biological systems provided that we change timescale. Infinity would mean intuitively overnight or at steady state, but what would the transient state represent ? How long would this temporary state last ?

                            The inducible NOT gate was the one of the major milestone of our project. However, scientific curiosity always pushes matters to the limit. The next step would be to design other gates. For now we obviously did not have time to reach this goal, nevertheless we built the foundation for it: we assessed the efficiency of activation and repression in the same transfected cell. For a robust design of new gates, we would need a repression whenever both repressor and activator are present in the same cellular context. Indeed this is what we observed (<B>Fig. 5</B>).
                            
                            The results obtained confirm our hypothesis that repression prevails over activation: when dCas9 expression is induced by galactose in a cell containing both activator and repressor modules, the GFP expression decreases. This is a crucial validation that our system can evolve in order to build complex gates, which need the property that repression gains when both activator and repressor modules coexist. This information is also fundamental for the implementation of the biological gates in <A href="https://2016.igem.org/Team:EPFL/Software_CELLO">CELLO</A>.

                            Biological circuits need to be stimulated by specific inputs, especially when they are used in the context of a biosensor, in order to return an output and pass along the appropriate information. As such, inducibility is a key feature of Intelligene: by creating a NOT gate induced by galactose, we have a straightforward way to demonstrate a situation in which a specific output is dependent on a specific input. In this case, we chose an input which was appropriate for the system we were working in, since natural switches using galactose as an input already exist in yeast. These switches cause yeast to change their metabolism and genetic expression in the presence of galactose. In this experimental section, we aimed to phenotypically change the expression of two different reporter genes in a same population of cells. Moreover, we chose to work with the inducible promoter GAL1 and the constitutive promoter TDH3.

                            In our design, TDH3 is constitutively active and it produces red fluorescence protein (RFP). When galactose is introduced the expression pattern changes. This leads the GAL1 promoter to drive the expression of both GFP and a gRNA that inhibits TDH3 by CRISPRi. As a result of the galactose induction, cells change phenotype switching from RFP production to GFP production.
