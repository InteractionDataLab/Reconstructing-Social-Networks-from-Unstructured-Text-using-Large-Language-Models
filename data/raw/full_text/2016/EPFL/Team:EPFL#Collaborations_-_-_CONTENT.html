                            We did not directly collaborated in the lab but we have done something so much bigger. With <A href="http://igem.today" target="_blank">igem.today</A>, we joined 30 teams on the same platform and helped them communicate their project while sharing their surveys, their funding campaign as well as what they were going through. We had the chance to meet students from very different backgrounds yet all with the same passion for synthetic biology.

                            We may not have a full lab-collaboration, but we’ve set up a system for the future to come, making it easier for new teams.

                            After spending some time in the iGEM community, we found that it was really difficult to be aware of the work of the other teams, even the ones that are geographically close to us. Additionally, many teams that we interviewed were searching for collaboration and struggling to find the right team. Notably, we thought that teams can greatly benefit from the experience of other teams: What drives other teams? And why did they decide on that topic? How do other teams solve their issues, be it technical or social? Or simply to discuss projects with other teams.
                        </P><P class="sub-lead justified">
                            We set out to find a way to improve this. Therefore we decided to create an online platform on which we hosted short team interviews and project descriptions which are simple and highly personal. Through this process, we created <A href="http://igem.today" target="_blank">igem.today</A>: an entertaining and educational place where teams around the world can share their project and learn about other team’s projects.

                            We contacted the teams through social media (Twitter and Facebook) and obtained positive responses from 30 teams in different countries and continents.

                            The discussions and interviews we had over Skype were really constructive as we learned about each others projects and how they were going. This also allowed us to meet great people from all around the world and see how they dealt with different obstacles like managing to work as a team or founding their project. Additionally, because of this platform, we now already know a couple of teams that we would like to meet and chat more to at the Giant Jamboree in Boston at the end of October. Not only knowing a few teams before meeting them is an advantage, it also can be beneficial during the iGEM experience over the summer. We learned a lot from other teams, and attempted to help others in every way we could. We therefore also believe this platform has a great potential to remain implemented in future iGEM years. Finally, we succeeded in making a unique website improving teams contacts and also helping teams find other like-minded projects to provide mutual collaborative assistance.

                            So far we received a lot of positive feedback about our initiative and people were really happy to learn about what everyone else was doing. One aspect contributing to this, is that is meant to give a quick and easy understanding of a project, so groups can easily get to know about a team within five minutes!

It must be very time-consuming for someone to do it during the iGEM project, but it might ultimately grow into more efficient way of connecting iGEM teams and further inter-team collaboration.&quot;

But it was so much more than that. We enjoyed the conversation with them so much, they really seemed like a friendly and fun-loving duo (Marie and Remy, the two people from the EPFL team who skyped with us).
                            As for the site they created, IGEM Today, I think we all agree what an amazing idea that was. Not only did they make it look really professional, but we also found some interesting articles about other IGEM teams’ projects. It just makes discovering other teams projects more awesome and easier. The page called ’Social media’ is a real treat, with all the humorous twitter and instagram posts from iGEM teams.
                            Thank you EPFL! You guys rock!”

Knowing what other teams are up to is usually hard and tedious to find, iGEM Today makes it fun, simple and creative. It's an up to date platform that makes a dynamic and interesting read. We were very happy to be a part of it and we hope that it keeps going on future years.
