                            In line with the rest of our project, our human practices project was all 
                            about tool creation and making synthetic biology more accessible. Public 
                            engagement and education were truly the unifying ideas behind our human 
                            practices.

                            At the beginning of our iGEM experience, we – like many other new iGEMmers -
                            browsed the wikis of other teams to see what they had managed to develop. 
                            We found the availability of information and their stories exciting, but the 
                            density of information was often intimidating (or absent as many wikis are 
                            uploaded last-minute, and often at the time when projects were up and running
                            and when collaboration is no longer needed). In addition, the long format of
                            writing made them time consuming to read, and the focus on results often 
                            removed us from the experience the team had. We love the wiki format, and 
                            find that it’s a great way to learn about a project when you really want to 
                            know everything, but we felt a need to address the wiki’s limitations. After 
                            all, someone from the public who wants to learn about synthetic biology will 
                            more likely want to learn about a team’s experience. Besides, they would also 
                            like to have an overview of that team’s work before deciding to take a deep-dive
                            into their project. It was with this in mind that igem.today was born, forming 
                            the centerpiece of our human practices efforts. igem.today is a media platform 
                            dedicated to iGEM. Through this platform we hosted media from different iGEM groups,
                            as well as surveys that we created and that were sent to us. Excitingly, we were 
                            able to post interviews and project descriptions for nearly one tenth of all iGEM 
                            teams, and reached over 2000 visitors! We participated in an incredible amount 
                            of dialog, and met so many amazing people, and our experience is all online for 
                            the whole world to enjoy!

                            In addition to our interviews and project descriptions, we also hosted multiple 
                            surveys, conducted a survey of previous iGEMmers, and hosted photos sent by 
                            various teams. We also gave multiple presentations open to the public and 
                            interviewed a professional synthetic biologist about her experiences in the 
                            field, and the intersections of synthetic biology, public communication, and
                            ethics. Head over to our <A href="https://2016.igem.org/Team:EPFL/Engagement">Engagement</A> page to learn more!
