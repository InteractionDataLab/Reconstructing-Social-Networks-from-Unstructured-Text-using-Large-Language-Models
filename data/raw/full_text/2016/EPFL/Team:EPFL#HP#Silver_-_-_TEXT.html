Silver Medal Human Practices
In line with the rest of our project, our human practices project was all                              about tool creation and making synthetic biology more accessible. Public                              engagement and education were truly the unifying ideas behind our human                              practices.
At the beginning of our iGEM experience, we – like many other new iGEMmers -                             browsed the wikis of other teams to see what they had managed to develop.                              We found the availability of information and their stories exciting, but the                              density of information was often intimidating (or absent as many wikis are                              uploaded last-minute, and often at the time when projects were up and running                             and when collaboration is no longer needed). In addition, the long format of writing made them time consuming to read, and the focus on results often                              removed us from the experience the team had. We love the wiki format, and                              find that it’s a great way to learn about a project when you really want to                              know everything, but we felt a need to address the wiki’s limitations. After                              all, someone from the public who wants to learn about synthetic biology will                              more likely want to learn about a team’s experience. Besides, they would also                              like to have an overview of that team’s work before deciding to take a deep-dive                             into their project. It was with this in mind that igem.today was born, forming                              the centerpiece of our human practices efforts. igem.today is a media platform                              dedicated to iGEM. Through this platform we hosted media from different iGEM groups,                             as well as surveys that we created and that were sent to us. Excitingly, we were                              able to post interviews and project descriptions for nearly one tenth of all iGEM                              teams, and reached over 2000 visitors! We participated in an incredible amount                              of dialog, and met so many amazing people, and our experience is all online for                              the whole world to enjoy!
In addition to our interviews and project descriptions, we also hosted multiple                              surveys, conducted a survey of previous iGEMmers, and hosted photos sent by                              various teams. We also gave multiple presentations open to the public and                              interviewed a professional synthetic biologist about her experiences in the                              field, and the intersections of synthetic biology, public communication, and                             ethics.
