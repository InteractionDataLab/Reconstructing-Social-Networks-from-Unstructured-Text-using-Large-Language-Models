The specific goal of the workshops is sharing scientific knowledge with young students about microbiology, molecular biology, and structural biology.</H4><H4>    The first workshop called Bacteria in my life and in my lab was performed in collaboration with Jorge Rocha, a postdoc in Harvard, as a part of the program Clubes de Ciencia Mexico in Yucatan on July 28th. This workshop combined microbiological strategies with computational tools in order to assess evolutionary processes in bacteria. 
</H4><H4>    The second workshop was called Hacking a fluorescent bacteria; this workshop was performed in collaboration with Biohackademy in the Lab of Physicochemistry and Engineering of Proteins, UNAM, in Mexico City on August 27th. The goal was the teaching of basic tools of molecular biology such as bacteria transformation using Green Fluorescent Protein as a reporter gene.
</H4><H4>    The third workshop was called 3D Biomolecules. It is an introduction to Structural Biology using software and 3D printing for the visualization and editing of proteins, nucleic acids, and metabolites.This workshop was performed in Hacedores MakerSpace in collaboration with Biohackademy on August 29th.
