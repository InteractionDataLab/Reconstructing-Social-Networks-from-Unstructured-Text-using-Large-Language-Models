First meeting of synthetic biology in Mexico(Guanajuato, Gto. August, 6th.)</H1><H1><P align="justify"><FONT size="3" color="gray"><BIG>On August 6th, Team Guanajuato_Mx hosted a MeetUp in Guanajuato City. Four Mexican teams attended our invitation: iGEM TEC CEM, Tec de Monterrey, Pumas México and Tec-Chihuahua.
This was a great chance to share our projects not only with other teams, but also to public in general. Several students from nearby cities (León, Celaya, Irapuato, Silao) joined the event where they had the chance to get involved a little bit in the field of synthetic biology.
It was a very enriching experience since we all received feedback from both experts and members of other teams. 
PhD Agustino Martínez, our invited researcher, gave us a speech about the projects he is currently working with and at the end we have a round table where we discussed some issues synthetic biology is facing nowadays 
Afterwards, during the evening, our guests could just relax, explore and enjoy all the wonders of this beautiful city.</BIG></FONT></P></H1><H1>2. Letting us know in “Clubes de Ciencia México”(Guanajuato, Gto. August, 6th.)</H1><H1><P align="justify"><FONT size="3" color="gray"><BIG>Every year during the summer, science clubs are held in Guanajuato city. During one week, students learn about an specific topic, coached by whether Mexican or foreign students from prestigious universities from the USA, for example, Harvard and the MIT. It is an honor for us to say that our members have participated in past editions.
  On this edition we had the opportunity to explain to all participants a little bit about our project &quot;Smart biopatch for detection of infections in burns&quot;. This task was carried out by Cristina Rincón, Montserrat Venegas and Uriel Barboza.
  Thanks to the local crew of Clubes de Ciencia México and to our member Rodolfo Ferro for giving us this space so that other students know what synthetic biology and iGEM are.</BIG></FONT></P></H1><H1>3. A visit to a primary school for awareness about burns(Silao, Gto. September, 13th.)</H1><H1><P align="justify"><FONT size="3" color="gray"><BIG>To raise awareness among smaller, students from UPIIG-IPN belonging to the iGEM Guanajuato team, attended primary school in a community in Silao, Guanajuato.
On September 13th, Israel González, Mijael Torres, Elizabeth Lozano and Maria Ramirez, students of Biotechnological engineering at UPIIG-IPN, attended to  &quot;Amado Nervo&quot; elementary school, in the community of San Miguel del Arenal in Silao, Guanajuato, where, accompanied by our adviser, PhD. Karla Macias we presented our project and its importance.
  Running with balloons simulating bacteria, rolling under &quot;smoke&quot; and singing about dangerous situations at our homes, are some of the interactive games and activities that were held with children from 1st to 6th grade.
  We thank to the Principal Lourdes Díaz Pérez and the teacher Ma. Concepción García Pérez, for giving us the space and the opportunity to make this visit, where we leave happy and satisfied with the attitude and attention of each child.</BIG></FONT></P></H1></B></CENTER></DIV><DIV class="footer"><DIV class="container"><P class="pull-left" style="font-size:.8em;"><A href="https://www.facebook.com/IGEM-Guanajuato-Mx-2016-1169541999738587/?fref=ts"> iGEM Guanajuato Mx</A></P><P class="pull-right" style="font-size:.8em;"><A href="mailto:igemgto@gmail.com"> igemgto@gmail.com</A></P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
