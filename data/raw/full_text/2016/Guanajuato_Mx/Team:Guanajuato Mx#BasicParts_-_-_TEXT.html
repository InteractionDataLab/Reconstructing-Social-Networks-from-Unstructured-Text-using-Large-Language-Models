Promoter chiA74 from Bacillus thuringiensis (Ba_K2057000)
The promoter chiA74 (chiA74p) controls the expression of the endochitinase     chiA74 from a strain of Bacillus thuringiensis. This regulatory element is also useful     to drive expression of a gene in Escherichia coli in a constitutive form (Barboza-     Corona et al. 2003, 2014). We have shown that chiA74p drive the expression of     the green fluorescent protein (gfp) gene in E. coli. In this sense, chiA74p can be     used to allow the synthesis of a gene in E. coli that want to be expressed     constitutively. Biobrick also include the ribosome binding sequence of chiA74. This     is one of the promoter that our team will use to express constitutively the lasR gene     in E. coli. Promoter chiA74p has the consensus sequences in 374-384 bp (-35)     region) and 399-404 (-10). The ribosome-binding site is located on 559-564 bp. (II)     The whole sequence of the chiA74 gene including its regulatory elements     (promoter, RBS, transcriptional terminator) is found under accession number     AF424979 (GenBank nucleotide sequence database).

Promoter BtI-BtII (Ba_K2057001)
The BtI-BtII promoter (BtI-BtIIp) is a dual strong promoter that controls the       expression of Cry1Ac proteins in Bacillus thuringiensis, but it allows the expression       of a gene constitutively in Escherichia coli. In this sense, BtI-BtIIp can be used to       allow the synthesis of a gene in E. coli that want to be expressed constitutively in E. coli. This is one of the promoter that our team will use to express constitutively       the lasR gene in E. coli. The biobrick also include a ribosome-binding site to to       start the synthesis of a proteins. This promoter can can be used not only in E. coli but also in B. subtilis and B. thuringiensis.  Promoter BtI-BtII has the consensus       sequences in 285-291 bp (BtI, -35 region), 294-302 (Bt II, -10) and 306-313 (BtI, -       10). The ribosome binding site is located on 377-381 bp. The whole sequence of       the cry1Ac gene including its regulatory elements (promoter, RBS, transcriptional       terminator) is found under accession number M35524 (GenBank nucleotide       sequence database).

Alginate lyase from Bacillus thuringiensis (BBa_K2057002)
Alginate lyases destroy the alginate, which is the main component of biofilm in       many bacteria, including that produced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. As it has       never reported the cloning of alginate lyase gene in B. thuringiensis we designed       the primers using the genome of Bacillus thuringiensis israelensis AM65-52       (GenBank accession number: CP013275.1). We amplified the alginate lyase gen       from the genome of Bacillus thuringiensis 4Q7. We are in process of sequencing       and test its functionality in E. coli

Signal peptide of ChiA74 (BBa_K2057007)
Signal peptide of ChiA74 translocate chitinase ChiA74 in Bacillus thuringiensis and     Escherichia coli. Sequence comes from the endochitinase gene chiA74 that is     located on a chromosomal sequence of B. thuringiensis. It will be used to     translocate the alginate lyase and the microcin in E. coli.
