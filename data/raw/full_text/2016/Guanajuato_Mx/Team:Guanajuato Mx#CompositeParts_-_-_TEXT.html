LasR under the regulation of the promoter chiA74 (BBa_K2057003)
The promoter chiA74 from Bacillus thuringiensis is functional in Escherichia coli,       and regulate the expression of a gene in a constitutive form. This composite part is       formed from the biobricks BBa_K2057000 (promoter chiA74), BBa_C0079 (lasR       gene).

LasR under the regulation of the promoter BtI-BtII (BBa_K2057004)
The promoter BtII from Bacillus thuringiensis regulate the expression of the cry       genes during sporulation, but it is functional in Escherichia coli in a constitutive       form. As promoter is not available in the biobricks, we amplified, sequenced and       characterized using the cry1Ac gene as template. Promoter BtI-BtII also includes       the ribosome binding site. This composite part is formed from the biobricks       BBa_K2057001 (promoter BtI-BtII), BBa_C0079 (lasR gene).

Expression of gfp under the regulation of promoter ChiA74 (BBa_K2057005)
We made this composite part to check the functionality of the promoter chiA74 in Escherichia coli. Biobrick BBa_K2057000 (promoter chiA74) includes the promoter       sequence and the ribosome binding sequence. The gfp gene is obtained from       BBa_E0040.

Expression of gfp under the regulation of promoter BtI-BtII (BBa_K2057006)
We made this composite part to check the functionality of the promoter BtI-BtII in Escherichia coli. Biobrick BBa_K2057001 (promoter BtI-BtII) includes the promoter       sequence and the ribosome binding sequence. The gfp gene is obtained from       BBa_E0040.
As promoter BtI-BtII (BtI-BtIIp) was obtained from a gene found in B. thuringiensis,            we want to test whether it drives the expression of a gene in E.coli. Our purpose             was to demonstrate if promoters BtI-BtII and chiA74 could be used as constitutive             promoters to express the LasR in our biological circuit. E. coli Top10/pHT3101-            chiA74p, E. coli Top10/pHT3101-BtI-BtIIp, and E. coli Top10/pHT3101-BtI-BtIIp-gfp             were grown at 37ºC to reach approximately 1 X 108 cells/mL. Cells were             centrifuged, dissolved in 150 mM NaCl, 100 mM Tris, pH8, and sonicated. Protein             concentration was determined by the Bradford method (BioRad). Fluorescence             was determined using the same amount of protein. As was expected, the higher             fluorescence, due to the GFP, was observed with E. coli Top10/pHT3101-BtI-BtIIp-            gfp, indicating that dual promoter BtI-BtII from B. thuringiensis is functional in E.             coli.

Alginate lyase and microcin controlled by lasI promoter (BBa_K2057008)
The alignate lyase gen and the microcin are controlled the lasI gene, which sense       the LasR-homoserinelactone.
Alginate lyase come from the chromosome of Bacillus thuringiensis 4Q7. For       making this part the next biobricks are used: BBa_K649000 (lasI promoter),       BBa_K2057007 (chiA74 signal peptide), BBa_K2057002 (alginate lyase gene) and       BBa_K565004 (microcin).
