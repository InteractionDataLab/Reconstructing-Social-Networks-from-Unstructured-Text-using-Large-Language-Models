Centro Estatal de Cuidados Críticos Salamanca
    Since our project was inspired by an actual social issue of our community , we were obligated to receive information directly from the real problem scenario. In that context we are thankful to “Centro Estatal de Cuidado Críticos” (which is the main center for health care of burns in the region, located in Salamanca, Guanajuato) for all the support to our project, the data provided and for being willing to collaborate with us.
    All along our project performance we had several interviews with the principal doctor of the hospital (Doctor Gerardo Garcia), who helped us to better understand the context, the scope and the constraints of the problem we aim to attack.
