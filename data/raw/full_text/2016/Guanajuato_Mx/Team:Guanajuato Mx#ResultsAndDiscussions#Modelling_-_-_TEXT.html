Modelling
Our first model will study the behavior of how P. aeuroginosa grows in natural conditions similar to those in the skin environment and it will also study how our sensing system in E. coli or L.lactis previously transformed with the genetic circuit grows. It will then analyze how P. aeuroginosa dies with the effect of an antimicrobial protein (lysozyme or alginate lyase protein).
Our second model will describe the concentration profile on the nitrocellulose membrane under the analysis of a single flux of homoserine lactone and antimicrobial agent (lysozyme or alginate lyase protein), on the other hand the analysis of a non-equimolar opposite diffusion of the two fluxes under study.
