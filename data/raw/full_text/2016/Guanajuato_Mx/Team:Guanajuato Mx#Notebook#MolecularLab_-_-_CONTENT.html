According to:<UL><LI>
          Inhibitory assays for <I>S. aureus</I>, <I>E. coli</I>, <I>P. aeruginosa</I>, <I>E. faecalis</I> and <I>L. lactis</I> were performed. We followed the protocol according to Barboza-Corona <I>et al.</I> (2007). For Nisin, eight dilutions 1:1 were made with 50 mM citric acid with 50% ethanol, which were placed on the wells (100 μL) and the highest concentration was 250 u/ml. As negative control was used 50 mM citric acid only. For Lysozyme, a 1 mg/ml stock was used and this was the highest concentration. Also eight dilutions were made with distilled water and no negative control was performed.

          The growing media for each bacteria was Tryptic Soy Broth (TSB, 0.7 g) plus 6 g of agar for 100 mL.

      We did a electrophoresis gel was 1% Formaldehyde Agarose and prepared the electrophoresis camera with NaOH 0.1N for 1 hour, the water and buffer are prepared with DEPC. We load two samples of RNA of human lysozyme. We observed three bands, one for DNA and other two for RNA 16S &amp; 32S.
