He has plans to pursue a career in biochemistry. Mark worked on the mutagenesis synthetase modeling and gathering LCMS data this summer.  
                   Outside of the lab, you will likely find Mark working on his car while simultaneously reading his favorite Nietzsche novel.</SPAN></SPAN></P></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="popup" id="kellibio"><SPAN class="close">×</SPAN><DIV class="popupcontentcontainer"><DIV class="popupcontent"><P><SPAN class="p"><SPAN style="font-size:30px;font-family:Aleo;"><B>Kelli Green</B></SPAN><SPAN style="font-size:20px"><B>Myers-Briggs Type Indicator: INFP</B><B>Major: Chemical Engineering </B><B>Year: 3rd</B></SPAN>
                This summer, Kelli was involved in policy interviews and write-ups, the design of the wiki, and wet lab tasks. 
 				Inspired by Ayn Rand’s “Anthem”, she has decided to pursue a career overseas in engineering.
				Whether it’s playing volleyball, walking forest trails with her dog, or enduring the frustrations of Pictionary with close friends, Kelli values fun, novelty, and the freedom to explore the natural world… just don't ask her to play contact sports.  
				Wherever Kelli’s journey leads her, the road will be paved with a healthy balance of IR-spectra, SDS sheets, and good humor.

				Nivedha, an adventurous spirit, is passionate about all things health. In the seventh grade, Nivedha recorded a country mixtape to send to Nashville record labels in pursuit of stardom. Unfortunately, this endeavor was futile, so she resigned to a life dedicated to science. During our project, she led the human practices team and worked on the cleavage enzyme BioBrick. In her free time, she enjoys going on road trips, having conversations with people and coercing her friends to go to the library with her.

				In seventh grade, Daniel watched a video on synthetic biology hosted by SciShow and became intrigued. On our project, he focused his time on characterization of the cleavage enzyme and the development of our mutagenesis software script. 
				Don’t be surprised if you find him locked into a late night battle with docking software or zombies online.
				With eight years of trumpet experience and a seat in Charlottesville Symphony Orchestra, Daniel supplements his scientific endeavors with a love for music. 
				Daniel is an exemplar renaissance man with interests in cats, cooking, and fiction-writing; he stands to be a character as multidimensional as the conceivable universe.

				Did you just lose five games of Bananagrams in a row? 
				Then you probably played against Raquel Moya. This summer, she worked on the mutageneis modeling script, team parts and public education. She is pursuing a career in engineering. Born deep in the New Mexico wilderness, Raquel was inspired by her home state's themes of science and art. The contemporary Meriwether Lewis of our iGEM team, Raquel can be found climbing treacherous rock faces and reading Steinbeck novels. 
				Be careful, if you challenge Raquel at one of her favorite board games, grapes’ will not be the only wrath you experience.

                It doesn’t matter whether it’s raining cats and dogs outside, or whether an experiment succeeded or failed, Anders always shows up to lab with a spring in his step, a smile on his face, and a contagious sense of positivity. This summer, he focused his time on public education and outreach and various laboratory tasks.
				Outside of the lab, Anders enjoys outdoorsy types of activities, including hiking, gardening, listening to music, and cooking. 
				As a pun master, he will rapidly bring a smile to the face of anyone he meets.
