While these are sufficient for the organization’s current purpose, we, the 2016 Virginia iGEM team, believe it is in the best interest of Open Bio Labs to adopt a standard set of safety guidelines better suited for the goals and philosophy of a biohackerspace with an emphasis on biocontainment. 

In the United States, there are three primary regulatory agencies for synthetic biology: the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the US Department of Agriculture’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) and the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). A 2014 report on Synthetic Biology and the US Biotechnology Regulatory System by J. Craig Venter Institute cites that these agencies have an adequate level of authority to address most, but not all, environmental, health and safety concerns with regard to synthetic biology. <SPAN class="references"><SUP>5</SUP><SPAN class="refbox"><B>Reference:</B>Sarah R. Carter, Ph.D., Michael Rodemeyer, J.D., Michele S. Garfinkel, Ph.D., and Robert M. Friedman, Ph.D. (2014). Synthetic Biology and the US Biotechnology Regulatory System: Challenges and Option (J. Craig Venter Institute).
</SPAN></SPAN> Because APHIS’ authority extends over engineered plants and FDA’s authority extends over foods and drugs, EPA is the only agency with broad authority to make regulatory decisions based on risks posed by genetically modified microbes to health and safety of humans, animals and ecosystems. A primary concern is that the anticipated increase in number and diversity of engineered microbes, especially those intended to be used in an open environment, will challenge EPA’s resources, expertise and authority to regulate synthetic biology. Furthermore, studies done by the NRC have concluded that genetic engineering does not present more risks than other methods of genetic modification like traditional breeding or hybridization.<SPAN class="references"><SUP>16</SUP><SPAN class="refbox"><B>Reference:</B>(2004). Safety of Genetically Engineered Foods: Approaches to Assessing Unintended Health Effects (Washington, D.C.: National Academies Press).
</SPAN></SPAN> Thus, individual products could pose risks that depend on the genetic changes made to which constructs, which can only be assessed on a case-by-base basis, an additional challenge for regulation. The emergence of biohackerspaces could potentially strengthen these concerns due to the desire to fuel innovation of novel biotechnology with minimal regulation. For this reason, we believe there is significant motivation for a community biology laboratory to implement a biocontainment method that can guarantee the survival of genetically modified microorganisms only under controlled conditions, applicable in a laboratory setting and an open environment.

Additionally, while the US has pre-market approval processes established (like the completion of an Environmental Impact Statement after an environmental assessment), the system recognizes that a pre-market approval is costly for producers and impractical because manufacturers already have market incentives to sell safe products. Post-market regulatory authority allows products to move to shelves more quickly and less expensively, but with more potential for harmful products to be sold.<SPAN class="references"><SUP>5</SUP><SPAN class="refbox"><B>Reference:</B>Sarah R. Carter, Ph.D., Michael Rodemeyer, J.D., Michele S. Garfinkel, Ph.D., and Robert M. Friedman, Ph.D. (2014). Synthetic Biology and the US Biotechnology Regulatory System: Challenges and Option (J. Craig Venter Institute).
</SPAN></SPAN> However, not everybody agrees that primarily post-market approval is the right answer. Due to the difficulty of “recalling” a living GMO from an open environment should there be health or environmental concern, some organizations have called for more stringent US biotechnology regulation system.<SPAN class="references"><SUP>18</SUP><SPAN class="refbox"><B>Reference:</B>FOE (Friends of the Earth, et al.).

To comply with this emerging sentiment and strengthen the biosafety practices of an community space that undergoes no institutional safety review, we propose the acceptance of an auxotrophic biocontainment method that confers an organism’s dependence on protected leucine, a user-supplied nutrient. This will allow creators to ensure the safety of their science, as well as quell the public’s concerns about community science spaces.
            
   We understand that community labs have a tremendous amount of freedom to do what they want, which also presents a lot of opportunity for things to go wrong, so to support our project of biosafety, we have partnered with our local community lab, Open Bio Labs, to develop a comprehensive, standard, and evolvable biosafety protocol for these labs to follow, which will streamline their ability to work with their community. Through Open Bio Labs, we are reaching out to other labs below to receive a first round of feedback before we share the protocol more broadly with the rest of the labs and with other relevant groups such as the CDC and the Woodrow Wilson center.

Some important consideration beyond the nature of the chemicals and organisms in use are the importance of well planned protocols, following protocols, good communication practices, thorough document management and the encouragement of open and honest reporting. Leaders must always ensure learning and not just training. By following these standard practices, an individual and her team can lower the risk that their research poses to others in the lab and in the world.</SPAN></P><SPAN class="ptitle">ORGANISMS AND PARTS</SPAN><SPAN class="stitle">Allowed organisms (including viral genomes)<SPAN class="references"><SUP>17</SUP><SPAN class="refbox"><B>Reference:</B>iGEM Headquarters Safety/White List - 2016.igem.org.
