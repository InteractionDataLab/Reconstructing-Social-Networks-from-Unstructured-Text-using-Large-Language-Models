BUSINESS
Our team hosted an educational series on synthetic biology called Building With Biology at our local community lab called Charlottesville Open Bio Labs. We designed educational games, modules, and scientific discussion topics catered to both children and adults. We produced two animated videos, circulated through broad social-media audiences, to educate the public about both synthetic biology in general and biocontainment in particular. We gauged biocontainment knowledge of other iGEM teams using a survey distributed to over 250 teams, and the depth of public synthetic biology knowledge through our Building With Biology discussions. In both cases, we found that further education was needed. We generated a comprehensive pamphlet and algorithmic widget to aid iGEM teams wishing to incorporate biocontainment in their project.
