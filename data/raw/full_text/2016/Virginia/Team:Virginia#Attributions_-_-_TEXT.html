Keith Kozminski, PhD
Team Advisor
A molecular cell biologist with 25 years of experience, Dr. Kozminski received a Ph.D. from Yale University. He joined the Department of Biology in the College of Arts and Sciences and the Department of Cell Biology in the School of Medicine at the University of Virginia in 2002, where he studies the molecular basis of cell shape and division and teaches courses in cell biology and synthetic biology.
Jason Papin, PhD
Team Advisor
Dr. Papin is a Professor of Biomedical Engineering at the University of Virginia who received his Ph.D. from the University of California, San Diego. He came to UVa in 2005. His research interests include the integration of high-throughput data into predictive, computational models that can be used to interrogate metabolic and regulatory networks in microbial pathogens and human disease. We are grateful to have Dr. Papin as an advisor.
Kay Christopher
Ms. Christopher has been an invaluable resource to us in the lab. Always willing to help,    Ms. Christopher makes sure our packages are delivered to our lab, shows us how to use new equipment, and orders common chemicals for us.    When we are in a pinch, she is even kind enough to lend us buffers and lab supplies from her own stock. In general, Ms. Christopher has made wetwork    much easier for Virginia iGEM 2016, and we thank her for everything she has done for us. She also works to provide us a lab space.
Rich Smindak
A graduate student in Dr. Kozminski's lab, Rich has been a saving grace whenever we encounter technical problems in the lab.     Need a 250mL centrifuge tube?    Rich probably knows where it is.     Having trouble with the sonicator?  Odds are good that Rich is willing to help you out.    Thank goodness that Rich is willing to put up with all of our badgering.     If not for this congenial man, we would have gotten stuck in the middle of our protocols more than once.
The people mentioned here aided us in the design and execution of our project. The lab work, modeling, human practices work, and web design was completed by members of Virginia iGEM 2016.
