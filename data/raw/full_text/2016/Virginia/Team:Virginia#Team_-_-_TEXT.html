Mark Bernard
Myers-Briggs Type Indicator: INTJ
Major: Biochemistry and Statistics
Year: 4th
As with other scientists, (looking at you, Sir Isaac), Mark’s inspiration for inquiry began his curiosity about the seasonal changes of his favorite backyard apple tree. He has plans to pursue a career in biochemistry. Mark worked on the mutagenesis synthetase modeling and gathering LCMS data this summer.                      Outside of the lab, you will likely find Mark working on his car while simultaneously reading his favorite Nietzsche novel.

Kelli Green
Myers-Briggs Type Indicator: INFP
Major: Chemical Engineering
Year: 3rd
This summer, Kelli was involved in policy interviews and write-ups, the design of the wiki, and wet lab tasks.       Inspired by Ayn Rand’s “Anthem”, she has decided to pursue a career overseas in engineering.     Whether it’s playing volleyball, walking forest trails with her dog, or enduring the frustrations of Pictionary with close friends, Kelli values fun, novelty, and the freedom to explore the natural world… just don't ask her to play contact sports.       Wherever Kelli’s journey leads her, the road will be paved with a healthy balance of IR-spectra, SDS sheets, and good humor.

Nivedha Kannapadi
Human Practices Coordinator
Myers-Briggs Type Indicator: ENFP
Major: Neuroscience
Year: 3rd
Nivedha, an adventurous spirit, is passionate about all things health. In the seventh grade, Nivedha recorded a country mixtape to send to Nashville record labels in pursuit of stardom. Unfortunately, this endeavor was futile, so she resigned to a life dedicated to science. During our project, she led the human practices team and worked on the cleavage enzyme BioBrick. In her free time, she enjoys going on road trips, having conversations with people and coercing her friends to go to the library with her.

Daniel Katz
CFO & Modeling Manager
Myers-Briggs Type Indicator: ESFP
Major: Biomedical Engineering
Year: 2nd
In seventh grade, Daniel watched a video on synthetic biology hosted by SciShow and became intrigued. On our project, he focused his time on characterization of the cleavage enzyme and the development of our mutagenesis software script.      Don’t be surprised if you find him locked into a late night battle with docking software or zombies online.     With eight years of trumpet experience and a seat in Charlottesville Symphony Orchestra, Daniel supplements his scientific endeavors with a love for music.      Daniel is an exemplar renaissance man with interests in cats, cooking, and fiction-writing; he stands to be a character as multidimensional as the conceivable universe.

Chris Li
Myers-Briggs Type Indicator: ISTJ
Major: Biochemistry
Year: 2nd
During the project, Chris helped with the design of the wiki. He has always had an interest in biological science, which has led him to pursue a career in medicine. If you have the misfortune of playing against him in soccer, chess, or monopoly, you will likely find yourself swiftly bested by a ruthless competitor.

Raquel Moya
Modeling Manager
Myers-Briggs Type Indicator: INTJ
Major: Biomedical Engineering
Year: 3rd
Did you just lose five games of Bananagrams in a row?      Then you probably played against Raquel Moya. This summer, she worked on the mutageneis modeling script, team parts and public education. She is pursuing a career in engineering. Born deep in the New Mexico wilderness, Raquel was inspired by her home state's themes of science and art. The contemporary Meriwether Lewis of our iGEM team, Raquel can be found climbing treacherous rock faces and reading Steinbeck novels.      Be careful, if you challenge Raquel at one of her favorite board games, grapes’ will not be the only wrath you experience.

Anders Nelson
CFO
Myers-Briggs Type Indicator: ENTP
Major: Biology
Year: 4th
It doesn’t matter whether it’s raining cats and dogs outside, or whether an experiment succeeded or failed, Anders always shows up to lab with a spring in his step, a smile on his face, and a contagious sense of positivity. This summer, he focused his time on public education and outreach and various laboratory tasks.     Outside of the lab, Anders enjoys outdoorsy types of activities, including hiking, gardening, listening to music, and cooking.      As a pun master, he will rapidly bring a smile to the face of anyone he meets.

Austin Rivera
Myers-Briggs Type Indicator: ENFJ
Major: Nanomedicine Engineering
Year: 3rd
While others might watch TV or follow a favorite sports team, Austin enjoys hands-on activities, which led him to pursue a degree in nanomedicine engineering. This summer, he worked on the educational videos and helped with lab work. He enjoys working in a nanomedicine laboratory and working on freelance professional graphic designs. To maintain balance with his heavy workload, Austin practices yoga, greeting the sunrise every morning.

Sarah Shan
Lab Manager
Myers-Briggs Type Indicator: ISTJ
Major: Neuroscience
Year: 3rd
If you ever have the fortune of tasting one of Sarah’s baked goods, you will find yourself among a blessed few – she is a true chemistry whiz both in the lab and the kitchen. This summer, she spent her days in lab designing and executing the team's lab experiments as well as writing and distributing our survey.     Sarah cites her interest in a medical career as a close relative who had a serious medical condition. In her free time, she enjoys staying fit, baking and laughing with friends.

Madeleine Stone
Team Leader
Myers-Briggs Type Indicator: INTJ
Major: Biochemistry
Year: 4th
Hailing from Massachusetts, Madeleine brings a unique New England flair to the iGEM team. As the leader of our team, she designed the team's lab work schedule and helped write the policy proposal.     She plans to pursue her passion for life science and leadership in the field of biotechnology.      If you need a new Spotify playlist, look no further.       From elegant French restaurants to Swedish night clubs, she can curate sonic ambiance for any occasion. Additionally, she likes to ski in her free time.
