Profile Information
Dan Katz
The catalytic event that inspired Dan to pursue a career synthetic biology was comically simple. In seventh grade he watched a video on synthetic biology hosted by SciShow, a scientific YouTube channel. Dan became incredibly interested in the topic from this video, and from then on made it his goal to participate in this type of research.  Coming to UVa in his first year, Dan already had plans to join the iGEM team and saw these plans come to fruition.
One look at Dan and you would assume he’s into modeling – this is true, but not the kind you might think.  Don’t be surprised if you find him locked into a late night battle with docking software, optimizing every possible configuration.  His software battles can also be recreational; Dan is a skilled video game player and an online force to be reckoned with.
Dan’s knowledge of keys extends beyond his computer.  With eight years of trumpet experience and a seat in the UVa orchestra, Dan supplements his scientific endeavors with a love for music.  He remains involved in music opportunities in Charlottesville, including the Charlottesville Symphony Orchestra, the First Year Players musical, and small groups in the area.
Dan is an exemplar renaissance man with further interests in cats, cooking, fiction-writing, and countless other pursuits; a character as multidimensional as the conceivable universe.
