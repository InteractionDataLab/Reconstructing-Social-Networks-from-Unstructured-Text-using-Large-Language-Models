We want to spread awareness among medical students and staff at AinShams University, Faculty of Medicine about Synthetic biology and its applications in the medical field, and to encourage them to think outside the box and participate in such competitions and researches. 
Also we believe that we should work on children and raise them early on understanding the importance of science and research.
</P><P><B> How: </B> We started by questioning random students at the faculty of medicine Ain Shams University about simple facts regarding synthetic biology. The lack of knowledge about the subject encouraged us to meet up with the college’s dean to talk about spreading awareness among both students and staff. Upon his immediate approval, flyers were made containing simple information about iGEM, synthetic biology and its applications in medicine as well as other fields. This was performed through a small event at the faculty of medicine Ain Shams University. The event was a success; both students and staff alike were very interested at what we had to say and they kept asking for more information especially concerning the field of synthetic biology. Such enthusiasm only served to encourage us to extend our human practice beyond university doors. </P><P>
This was performed in 2 high schools in Cairo where we sat down with a number of students in a class room and explained some fun facts about biology and shifted to the rising field of biology which is synthetic biology, we were very happy to see such a positive response from those amazing young people. </P><P><B> Second step: </B>
Our aim is to spread awareness beyond medical staff, researchers and hospital, hoping to reach all youth in Egypt and worldwide.

<B> How: </B> This was performed by starting a series of animated web videos on our YouTube channel. These videos talk about synthetic biology in a simple and visually attractive way. We started this series to serve as a basic introduction to the wonderful world of synthetic biology. You can find our channel by clicking <A href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnNqg-HrV22gZh3mvyK8PZA">Here</A> . 

</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="text-area"><DIV class="container"><DIV class="row"><DIV class="title"><P class="h2WM">Human Practice for Golden Medal :</P><P class="large"> Aim is to spread awareness and knowledge among researchers and physicians at 57357 Hospital about Synthetic biology and to get their feedback and suggestions about our work.
</P><P><B> How: </B> An educational session was scheduled at 57357 Hospital. The whole team was there for the session, we started by setting up our poster, setting up the presentation and everything was good to go. </P><P>
The session started by introducing team members, iGEM and the aim of our work. Then we went on to explain synthetic biology and our plan to use it along with bioinformatics to fulfill our aim.  </P><P>
We were considering using either nano particles or bacteria for the delivery of our circuit. Since our ultimate goal is reach a treatment that can be used by physicians for HCC, we asked the physicians attending our session about their preference for the vehicle to deliver our circuit. We explained the advantages and disadvantages of both ways.We found out that the majority of them preferred nano particles to bacteria for delivery. We also found out that the researchers as well displayed more interest in nano particles to be used in synthetic biology research.We integrated their opinions in our project and decided to use nano particles instead of bacteria this year.
The session was concluded by answering the staff’s questions and their wishes of good luck.
