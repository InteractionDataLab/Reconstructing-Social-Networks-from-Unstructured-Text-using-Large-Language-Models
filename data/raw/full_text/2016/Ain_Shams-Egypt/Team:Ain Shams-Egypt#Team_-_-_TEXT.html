Munir Al-Hussaini
Medical Student
Everything in our life has to do with science. Since my early education I have been fascinated by biological sciences and technology. And I used to believe that “Everything in our life has to do with science”; and that makes life more interesting. However, I was more into human biology than any other branch; that’s why I chose medicine as my favorite and future career to understand and deal with the health of the most complicated biological system on earth. Yet, I truly believe that no one can separate the lab from the hospital because what is discovered in the lab is the cornerstone for the progress made in medicine. I hope one day I will be able to participate in the development of both sciences.
