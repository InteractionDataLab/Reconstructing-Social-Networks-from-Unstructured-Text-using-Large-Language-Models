Gel electrophoresis showed very strong bands, indicating that there is no fault with PCR reagents. The problem may come from the template, primers or PCR program.</LI><LI>More PCRs were performed to investigate the problem. Primer concentration, Mg2+ concentration and lower annealing temperature range were adjusted. It is found that the best annealing temperature for the BioBrick prefix and suffix primers was 40.0 °C when amplifying StarScaffold DNA (IDT synthesised).</LI><LI>Performed PCR optimisation using the BioBrick prefix and suffix primers, Q5 polymerase and No Helix StarScaffold DNA (IDT synthesised) with a gradient of annealing temperature between 40-60 °C.

Sequencing showed that the plasmid did not contain the right insert. BLAST was performed and found that the insert could be from genomic contamination which happened to be of the right size.</LI><LI>Ligation of StarScaffold DNA into pSB1C3 was aborted because ligation of StarScaffold DNA into pET23a and subsequently the protein expression have a higher priority.</LI><LI>Thinking that genomic contamination could come from the midiprep of pET23a, more pET23a was digested with NotI and NdeI and treated with shrimp alkaline phosphatase (SAP). This may prevent plasmid religation and reduced the change of having colonies without the insert, and also prevent digested genomic contamination from being ligated into the plasmid.</LI><LI>Ligated the digested and SAP-treated pET23a with StarScarffold DNA.</LI><DIV class="timeline-footer primary"><P class="text-right">August-08-2016</P></DIV><LI class="timeline-inverted"><DIV class="timeline-panel"><DIV class="timeline-heading"><H4>Week 8 (15/08/16 – 19/08/16)</H4></DIV></DIV></LI><LI>PCR optimisation using VF2 and VR primers, as well as T7 promoter and T7 terminator primers with known plasmids.
