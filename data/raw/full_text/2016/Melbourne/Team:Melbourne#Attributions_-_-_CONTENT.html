A/Prof Cheng has also generously allowed us use of critical equipment in his lab, without which our lab could not operate.</P><H3>Dr. Heather Verkade, Dr. Alana Mitchell, and Dr. Terry Mulhern</H3><P>Drs. Verkade, Mitchell, and Mulhern helped supervise our lab work. They were all incredibly generous with their time and saved us at the 12th hour more times than one can count. Without them we would not have been able to maintain regular laboratory hours and critical project momentum.</P><H3>Brent Smith, Lynn Tran, and Maz Corrales</H3><P>The biochemistry teaching lab technical staff were always there to help us when we (often) needed them. Without their incredible generosity and wealth of biochemical expertise we would have been completely lost this year.</P><H3>Sean Lowe</H3><P>In particular we'd like to thank Sean Lowe from the 2014 iGEM team for his advice and guidance in setting up the team and for his efforts in helping establish a Melbourne University iGEM community.</P><H3>Peter Collins</H3><P>We would like to thank Peter for his advice during the formation of the team.</P>

The 2016 Melbourne iGEM Team was founded as an extracurricular group in a disused biochemistry laboratory across from the biochemistry staff offices. We began brainstorming and setting us the lab in February 2016. After much deliberation we decided on the StarScaffold and we began to flesh it out. After several months we ordered our DNA and began Lab work in early July. Training occurred throughout as we learnt new techniques and new people joined the team. Hopefully our hard work will come to benefit later years.
