Silver
Validated Part
BBa_K2140002: Prototype 1. Our part was sequenced and expressed. Our part was also shown to be of the correct sequence and to produce a protein of the correct size, as demonstrated in our results section. As such, this part functions properly in expressing our protein of interest.
Collaboration
In collaboration with the NUS Singapore iGEM team, we developed a molecular modelling algorithm and successfully modelled the StarScaffold and looked at its predicted effect on enzyme kinetics.
Human Practices
As detailed in our human practices section, our team held a number of talks to explain and promote synthetic biology among high school and university students. Additionally, we held a crowdfunding campaign.
