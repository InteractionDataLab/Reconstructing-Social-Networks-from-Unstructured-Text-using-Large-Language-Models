Robert Naturani
I'm a lifelong science nerd and appropriately a biochemistry major undertaking Honours at the Bio21 institute. Through this project I've gained valuable experience in experiment planning and design. The process of designing and creating a novel biological system has been enlightening and tremendous fun.
Ok!
Jeffrey Lai
I'm a third year biomedical student majoring in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology. I have been assisting Robert in the design of StarScaffold and planning experiments. I really enjoy the time with the team members at the laboratory. This wonderful research experience has led me to consider becoming a clinical researcher.
Ok!
Ray Shen
I'm currently in my third year of Bachelor of Science, majoring in Immunology. I have found iGEM to be a unique experience that has given me great insight into the process of project design and experiment planning. I work with other team members in the wet lab to synthesise the StarScaffold protein, and I am also part of the outreach team, working on improving awareness and understanding of synthetic biology in the wider community.
Ok!
Ella Bocquet-Gaylard
I currently an undergraduate student in my third year of a Bachelor of Science, majoring in either Microbiology or Biochemistry, my two scientific loves. I am really enjoying putting the theory from my degree into practice with the hands on work of the StarScaffold project! As well as working with the other team members in the wet lab I am on the outreach team, working on bringing knowledge of synthetic biology into the wider community.
Ok!
Victor Lin
I am currently in my final year of a Bachelor of Biomedicine at the University of Melbourne, majoring in Microbiology and Immunology, with an intention to pursue either an Honours year or a Doctor of Medicine at the completion of my undergraduate degree. I am grateful to have been born in an era, where our understanding of biology has progressed to such an extent that we are now capable of re-engineering biological systems to display functions that do not exist in nature, but have the potential to benefit mankind. I am excited to be part of the Melbourne iGEM Team this year and cannot wait to see what the team can create.
Ok!
Kimber Wise
I am in my final semester of a Bachelor of Science, majoring in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology. I have really enjoyed being a part of this year's iGEM team and working in the lab with a great group of people, putting our practical skills to the test. It was also great to be a part of the outreach team and give talks at schools, spreading the word of synthetic biology. I have high hopes for our project and am excited to see where future iGEM teams will take it!
Ok!
Eileen Hu/b>
I'm a third year Bachelor of Biomedicine student at the University of Melbourne, majoring in Microbiology and Immunology. I've always loved science and would love to utilise what I've learned to create something exciting and new. As part of the Wet Lab team in 2016, I have focused on helping plan and conduct experiments to make our StarScaffold project a reality. In the future I'd love to continue my involvement in biomedical or clinical research.
Ok!
James Bennett
I am a Master of Biomedical Engineering student at the University of Melbourne. As the team's engineer, it is my responsibility to use various engineering techniques to characterise our Star Peptide. This involves developing models and using simulations to analyse its behaviour. I am also helping to create and design the website for our project.
Ok!
Wilfrid Speagle
I am in my third year of my Bachelor of Science at the University of Melbourne, majoring in Biochemistry. I plan to spend next year doing Honours in the field of Proteomics at the Bio21 Institute. I will be working with the wet lab team to develop our prototype, while also focusing on helping the team fund its project through by identifying and contacting prospective sponsors.
Ok!
Hui Min Tay
I am a first year student in the Bachelor of Science, looking to major in Chemistry or Biochemistry. Although I am still undecided about what I want to do in future, biomedical research sounds like an interesting and fruitful career and I am glad for the opportunity to get some first-hand experience through iGEM. I have learnt a lot while working with the rest of the team on developing the StarScaffold and it has  given me a fantastic insight into the both the challenges and rewards of research work.
Ok!
Sugan Ramasamy
I am currently in my final year of  Bachelor of Biomedicine, majoring in Bioengineering Systems. I am part of the lab team which is responsible in synthesizing the StarScaffold protein in the laboratory. iGEM has given me tremendous value-added experience as well as many opportunities to put in practise molecular techniques and laboratory skills that in learnt in my course of study.
Ok!
Stephanie Li
I am currently in my final year of the Bachelor of Science, majoring in Bioengineering Systems and Mathematics. Being part of iGEM has given me a fantastic glimpse of the research planning and execution process, and skills that Iâ€™m eager to utilise in the future. I am part of the dry lab team, which works on modelling and the wiki design, the latter of which has been my responsibility.
Ok!
Sponsors
The Melbourne University iGEM team, and the incredible learning experience and science outreach that we participated in, would not be possible without the support of our sponsors. We would like to sincerely thank them for their generosity and support of young scientists in Australia.
We would also like to thank all the people who generously contributed to the funding of our project, without which, our experiments would not have been possible:
