Transformation of J04450
experimental materials
competent E·coil  BL21   100 μL（made by ourselves)
J04450-pSB1C3  plasmid   2 μL（50 pg/μL）
procedure:
Spin down the DNA tubes from the Competent Cell Test Kit/Transformation Efficiency Kit to collect all of the DNA into the bottom of each tube prior to use. A quick spin of 20-30 seconds at 8,000-10,000 rpm will be sufficient. Note: There should be 50 µL of DNA in each tube sent in the Kit.
Thaw competent cells on ice. Then pre-chill by placing the tubes on ice.
Pipet 2 µL of DNA into competent cell tube.
Pipet 100 µL of competent cells into each tube. Flick the tube gently with your finger to mix. Incubate on ice for 30 minutes. Pre-heat waterbath now to 42°C. Otherwise, hot water and an accurate thermometer works, too!
Heat-shock the cells by placing into the waterbath for 1 minute. Be careful to keep the lids of the tubes above the water level, and keep the ice close by.
Immediately transfer the tubes back to ice, and incubate on ice for 5 minutes. This helps the cells recover.
Add 900 µL of LB media per tube, and incubate at 37°C for 2 hours.
Centrifuge the tube at 4000 rpm for 2 minutes, make the bacteria deposit at the bottom of the tube.
Discard 800 μL supernatant liquid and resuspend the bacteria .
2. Coat plate: add the solution 200 μL in a plate and  spread  it  , then cultivate it overnight.

Meeting with Prof. Wen Jinlong:               1. Need a better presentation 2. Innovative but application required
Date: May 13th
Recorder: Kaiyue Ma
After 14 hours cultivation, the liquid mediums have all turned red, noting that the intensities aren't the same. We believe it results from the difference caused when we picked the colonies.
We assume that after sufficient time cultivating, the intensities may become about the same as expected.
So we choose two of the four tubes to continue cultivating(one is stronger while the other is weaker) to prove our assumption. The rest two are stored at 4°C.
After 12 more hours cultivating, both of the formerly chosen tubes turn into a deeper red, and can not be distinguished by eye.
Store them in fridge.
