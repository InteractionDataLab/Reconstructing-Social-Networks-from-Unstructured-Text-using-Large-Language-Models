Deutsche Bank
Deutsche Bank is a German global banking and financial services company with its headquarter in the Deutsche Bank Twin Towers in Frankfurt.  It has more than 100,000 employees in over 70 countries, and has a large presence in Europe, the Americas, Asia-Pacific and the emerging markets. In 2009, Deutsche Bank was the largest foreign exchange dealer in the world with a market share of 21 percent and now has offices in major financial centres worldwide. The bank offers financial products and services for corporate and institutional clients along with private and business clients. Services include sales, trading, research and origination of debt and equity; mergers and acquisitions (M&A); risk management products, such as derivatives, corporate finance, wealth management, retail banking, fund management, and transaction banking.
We receive funding from Deutsche Bank AG, Singapore Branch (“DB”), which has its office at Level 13, South Tower, One Raffles Quay, Singapore 048583. It acts through the Deutsche Bank Asia Foundation in certain charitable activities as part of its corporate social responsibility program. Deutsche Bank AG, Singapore Branch has sponsored the USTC iGEM team since 2012 and USTC would like to continue the successful partnership with Deutsche Bank this year. The donation will sponsor 11 students from USTC to participate in the 2016 iGEM in October.
We don't get in touch with Deutsche Bank AG, Singapore Branch directly, but through University of Science and Technology of China Initiative Foundation (“USTCIF”). USTCIF has its registered office in Beijing and is a tax-deductible non-profit organization in China, which has access to contacting DB so that we can get assistance from DB.
Thank Deutsche Bank for having been the exclusive sponsor on iGEM USTC Team!             For more information please click on https://www.db.com/.
