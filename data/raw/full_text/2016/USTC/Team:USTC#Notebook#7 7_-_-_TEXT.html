Amplify the bacteria
Transfer thebacteria medium into the 200mL LB fluid medium and cultivate at 37°C and shock at 250 rpm/min           Preparate competent cell
Measure the OD600 of the medium until itreach 0.4.
OD             BL21  0.373           1.    Transfer the medium into the 50 mLcentrifuge tube(precool in ice) and then incubate on ice for 30 minutes.
Centrifuge the tube at 4000 rpm for 15min at 4℃.
Discard supernatant liquid and add 30 mL80 mM CaCl2-20 mM MgCl2 per tube.
Resuspend the bacteria and incubate onice for 30 minutes.
Centrifuge the tube at 2700 rpm for 15min at 4℃.
Discard supernatant liquid and add 2 mL100 mM CaCl2 -18% glycerin per tube.
Resuspend the bacteria and subpackage100 uL per tube(1.5 mL).
Store the tube at -80°C.
