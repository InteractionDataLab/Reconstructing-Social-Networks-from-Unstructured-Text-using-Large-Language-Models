Last growth curve looks terrible， so we decide to repeat the experiment.
Yeast Growth Curve Measurement 2
Experimental materials:
YPD culture medium 500 mL(newly made by ourselves)           Yeast W303(made by ourselves)
Procedure: 1. Pick the colonies of Yeast W303 into an EP tube containing some YPD culture,then shake it over till evenly.             2. Take 1 mL liquid from the EP tube to three 250 mL erlenmeyer flasks respectively,each containing 100 mL YPD culture already.             3. Cultivate them at 30°C and shake at 250 rpm/min,time from now.             4. Take 700 μL liquid from each of the three flasks into EP tube respectively after specific time(shown in the table below).           5. Measure the OD data of each EP tube.

Result Failed，marker is the only thing which is visable.
Possible Reasons
1.DNA template has denaturated.             2.Primer mismatch.             3.DNA template is sufficient .             4.Primer TM is too high to separate.             5.PCR cycling conditions are not suitable.           6.Temperature is too high to connect primer to plasma backbone.

Possible reasons
DNA template has denaturated.
The amount of DNA template is too little.
Primer is not suitable.
PCR cycling conditions(temperature and time) are not suitable.
Operational errors.
We need more Repeated experiments.

Transformation of J04450
experimental materials
competent E·coil  BL21   100 μL（bought from Transgen Biotech)
J04450-pSB1C3  plasmid   2 μL（50 pg/μL）
procedure:
Spin down the DNA tubes from the Competent Cell Test Kit/Transformation Efficiency Kit to collect all of the DNA into the bottom of each tube prior to use. A quick spin of 20-30 seconds at 8,000-10,000 rpm will be sufficient. Note: There should be 50 µL of DNA in each tube sent in the Kit.
Thaw competent cells on ice. Then pre-chill by placing the tubes on ice.
Pipet 2 µL of DNA into competent cell tube.
Pipet 100 µL of competent cells into each tube. Flick the tube gently with your finger to mix. Incubate on ice for 30 minutes. Pre-heat waterbath now to 42°C. Otherwise, hot water and an accurate thermometer works, too!
Heat-shock the cells by placing into the waterbath for 1 minute. Be careful to keep the lids of the tubes above the water level, and keep the ice close by.
Immediately transfer the tubes back to ice, and incubate on ice for 5 minutes. This helps the cells recover.
Add 900 µL of LB media per tube, and incubate at 37°C for 2 hours.
Centrifuge the tube at 4000 rpm for 2 minutes，make the bacteria deposit at the bottom of the tube.
Discard 800 μL supernatant liquid and resuspend the bacteria .
2. Coat plate: add the solution 200 μL in a plate and  spread  it  , then cultivate it overnight.

Colony picking
Add 5mL LB liquid medium (1.7 μL 100 mg/mL chloramphenicol has already been in LB) in each tube and we prepare 4 tubes.
Pick the colnes in the test tubes.

Plasmid Extraction for J04450
1 Centifuge 1.5 mL bacterium solution at 11000 rpm, few sediment getted. Remove the  supernatant. Add another 1.5 mL bacterium solution to the EP tube and centifuge at 11000 rpm again.
2 Add 250 μL Buffer P1, resuspend cells.
3 Add 250 μL Buffer P2, mix well, 4 min's standing.
4 Add 350 μL Buffer P3, mix well.
5 134000 rpm centifuge 10 min, move all supernatant to adsorption column, 11.6 rpm centifuge 30 s, discard filtrate.
6 Add 500 μL Buffer DW1, 12000 rpm centifuge 30 s, discard filtrate.
7 Add 500 μL Wash Solution, 12000 rpm centifuge 30 s, discard filtrate. Repeat once.
8 12000 rpm centifuge 1 min.
9 Put the adsorption column in a new EP tube. Add 50 μl ddH2O( heating in water bath at 55 degree Celsius), 10 min's standing, 12000 rpm centifuge 1 min. Preserve in the EP tube with ddH2O at 4 degree Celsius.
After extraction, we measure the OD and A260/A280 of plasmids. The results demonstrate that  plasmid extraction is successful.
