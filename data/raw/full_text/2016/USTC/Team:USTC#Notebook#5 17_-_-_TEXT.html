Recorder: Kaiyue Ma
Take all the four tubes(two in the shaker and two in the fridge), use the vortex to resuspend the bacteria, and mesure the intensity of each tube.
Use LB medium for zero calibration.

As the data is not ideally parallel, more experiments are needed.
Colony picking
Add 1.7 μL chloramphenicol (100 mg/mL) in 5 mL  LB liquid medium (5 mL*4).
Pick the colnes from the original plate to four test tubes.
Cultivate the bacteria at 37°C and shock at 250 rpm/min overnight.

Preparation of GuHCl solution
prepared 200 mL buffer solution for the simulating experiment of toxicity measuring.
The concentration of the buffer is 0.5 mol/L. Here are the ingredients:
component volume             Disodium hydrogen phosphate dodecahydrate: 35.835 g           Sodium dihydrogen phosphate dihydrate: 15.63 g
Diluted into a 200 mL solution.
Preparation of liquid medium
Chengle Zhang prepared 500 mL YPD liquid medium for yeasts last night. Here are the ingredians:
component proportion             Yeast extract: 1%             peptone：2%             D-glucose： 2%

1.The purposes
Add poly A to the 3' termination of DNA sequence and test whether the stability of corresponding mRNA will be enhanced.
2.The principles
it is supposed that poly A in the 3' termination of mRNA will increase its stablilty, but how many adenine residuals are efficient remains obsicure. In the pre-experiment, we use the part BBa_J04450 which contains a RFP sequence. Consequently, we can test the stability of mRNA by detect fluorescence intensity. Red/ET recombineering system is adopted to edit the DNA sequence and construct plasmids.
3.The materials and apparatus
(1)competent E·coil  BL21   100 μL
(2)J04450-pSB1C3  plasmid   2 μL（50 pg/μL）               (3)recombineering kits bought from Vazyme company(http://www.vazyme.com/)             (4)spectrophotometer

4.1 PCR Amplification of Target DNA To clone any DNA fragment into a linearized vector using this kit, the insert fragment should be obtained by PCR using primers with an add-on of 15-20 bp homologous to either side of the restriction site that is used to               linearize the vector. Therefore, the primer should be 5'-homologous-restriction site-poly A-restriction site-homologous-3'. 4.2 Preparation of Linearized Vector The linearized vector should be linearized by restrictiong endonuclease SAU3AI. 4.3 Recombination Procedure Set up the following reaction on ice in a 0.5 mL Eppendorf tube by mixing the following reagents gently and then spin down briefly to collect the reagents at the bottom of the tube.

Incubate the reactions at 37°C for 30 minutes, and then transfer tubes to ice and incubate on ice for 5 minutes. 4.4 Proceed with transformation The reaction can also be stored at -20°C for later transformation. 4.5 Transformation 1. Thaw one vial of frozen 200 μL competent cells on ice. Tap the tube gently to ensure that the cells are suspended.               2. Add 20 μL of reaction mixture to the competent cells. Tap the tube gently and incubate the tube on ice for 30 minutes.               3. Heat shock the cells by placing them in 42°C water bath for 45-90 seconds and then place the tube on ice for 2 minutes.               4. Add 900 ul of SOC medium or LB culture to the cells and then incubate the cells on a shaker set at 200 rpm at 37°C for 60 minutes.               5. Centrifuge the cell down at 5000 rpm for 5 minutes and then remove and discard about 100 μl of medium. Gently suspend the cells by tapping the tube.             6. Incubate the plates overnight at 37°C.

Pre-test for Toxicity Testing of GuHCl to Yeast W303
Experimental materials: YPD culture medium 400 mL(made by ourselves)             Yeast W303(made by ourselves)
Procedure: 1. Subpackage the YPD medium into 20 test tubes(5 mL per tube) and into 2 erlenmeyer flasks(95 mL each).               2. Pick the colonies of Yeast W303 into 2 test tubes,then cultivate them at 30 degree centigrade and shake at 250 rpm/min 24h.             3. Store medium of the left tubes and flasks at 4°C.

There are some precipitations in the two test tubes with yeast.
Yeast Growth Curve Measurement 1
Procedure: 1. 24 h later, put the medium with yeast in the two tubes into two flasks mentioned above respectively.               2. Time from now, take 1 mL liquid from each of the two flasks and the original medium into EP tube respectively after specific time(shown in the table below).             3. Measure the OD data of each EP tube.
