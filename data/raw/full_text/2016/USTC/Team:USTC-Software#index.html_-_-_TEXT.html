From a truth table to abstract logic circuits.
In BioBLESS a truth table dialog box will be displayed for users to input Boolean numbers 0/1. All you need to do is to click Boolean buttons and then “Create”.
The corresponding designed logic circuits with different predicted performances will be automatically generated and displayed in order. You can immediately and clearly see the configuration of a designed logic circuit, which in most                         cases is supposed to be a compli- cated multi-input circuit.
According to the perturbation ratio you input, such as 20% or 30%, the concentration-time curves of inputs and outputs will be shown toge- ther to shed light on the robustness of a designed gene circuit. Moreover, data processing and                         demonstration will help users to better understand the robustness of designed gene circuits.

Users have the freedom to drag specific BioBricks on our canvas and combine them into a functional gene circuit. Then the DNA sequence and other information of the designed circuit are available for users to check and download.
Wet lab protocols are partly incorporated into our DNA sequences which may make the design better and applicable in laboratories.
