All experiments, presentations, results and constructs in our project is originally and independently designed and achieved by memebers of Team USTC, which is detailedly attributed below.
Instructors of USTC provided some advice and suggestions on our project, and helped us acquire some materials, such as chassis of yeast and the Y2H genes.
Dr. Dong Men of Wuhan Institute of Virology provided us the SUP35NM gene, and a lot of advice on our project.
Team USCT-Software helped us with image processing.
The sequencing was done by Sangon Biotech.
The 3D printed model that we designed was produced by a workshop on Taobao.
The mascot was designed by ourselves and painted maily by ourselves except the one on our team uniform, which was the work of an artist we hired through Taobao.
Our team uniform was designed by ourselves, and produced by a workshop on Taobao.
