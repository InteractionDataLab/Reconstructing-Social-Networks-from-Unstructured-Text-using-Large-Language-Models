A Prion's Life
Project
Hello~ Let me introduce myself first. I am Super Nemo, the mascot of Team USTC. As you can see, my body is just like the structure of the yeast prion Sup35 that Team USTC focused on.
There is no need for any panics in the yeast prion because it is totally human-friendly. As one kind of yeast prion, Sup35 can aggregate at a certain temperature range, and protein denaturant Guanidine Hydrochloride (GdnHCL) can eliminate the aggregation. Based on the properties, we designed two systems--Propri-ontein and Pro Priontein. Want to know more? Welcome in!

Team
We always say, "the fire burns high when everybody adds wood to it." Having kept eyes on our members all the way, Nemo find the saying suitable for our team. Definite divisions of work made our project proceeded smoothly and the spirit of unity gave us continuous confidence. Those who provided us with experiment materials and suggestions boosted our project, and the sponsorship from our school and Deutsche Bank cleared our worry for finace. Without all of these, we would never have our present success. I, Super Nemo, show my sincere gratitude for all of you on behalf of Team USTC!

Marvellous Model
We have also done marvellous modelling work. Nemo extraordinarily admired for modelling group! Our modelling mainly consists of three parts. One of them models the chemical reaction in the system to show the effect of GdnHCl and heat shock; the second part focuses on binding reactions involving two systems, binding of AD and BD of GAL4 promoters, and binding of sfGFP1-10 and sfGFP11. The last part models the application of our products in hardware. And we have opened our codes, so you can see how brilliant our modelling work is more directly!

Human Practice
As the mascot of Team USTC, I have been quite busy in the last few months because I would show up every time our team carried out human practices. We held a poster presentation for public; designed an experiment for kids to help them get hands on biology; and we held "Plastic for Plants", gave a lecture for high school students and introduced iGEM to freshmen. We consulted Dr. Dong Men for help, attended The 4th iGEM Competition Asia Conference in Taiwan and communicated with Team HFUT. Last but not least, a questionnaire helped us a lot to know public's attitudes. Exhausted, nevertheless I am delighted!

Parts
As an old Chinese saying goes, "Forefathers plant trees and posterities enjoy the shades." We have conquered so many barriers during building our circuits to accomplish our project, so that we would like to share some useful parts therefore the latter teams can get hands on them to save valuable time. We created three basic parts, and six composite parts to test the fluorescence intensity in different situations and the aggregation ability of SUP35. Want more details? Help yourself!

2016 is our 10th year participating in iGEM.
We designed this special homepage to commemorate this special year.
Two Chinese characters "十年" on the bottom left corner means "ten years".
Live long and prosper!
