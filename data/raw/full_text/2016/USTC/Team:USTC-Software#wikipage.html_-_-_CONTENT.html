							When we talk about internal clock, we actually refer to the circadian rhythm of higher animals and plants. Sensing the cycling environmental factors (light and temperature, etc.), circadian clock allows organism to behave accordingly and reguarly. This year, we develop a plug-in for microbes, a system that can build up an internal clock for microbes and guide them to live regularly as well as to work efficiently. Also, we could insert this system into dangerous strains and endue life span, they are doomed to die before causing any biohazard. Flip units based on recombinase system are introduced in our system. One flip unit is able to calculate a specific period of time, while several flip units form one time cycle. So, when we combine several time cycles together, a timer is constructed. Different flip unit assemblies creat distinctive time cycles, forms different kinds of timers. We believe this system will be of great significance to biological devices with time-related concepts.

							It is well known that the internal clock is of great significance to human life. The time rhythm let people work and rest regularly, which keeps us healthy and energetic. However, in microbes, especially prokaryotic organism, we could hardly find a strain with rhythm.
						</P><P>
							Actually, adding rhythm into microbes is a meaningful thing, by which would provide us a brand new technology platform or control system. This year, we hope to construct a rhythm device with time limit. As follows, we will use 3 simple hypothetical cases to illustrate its future application potentials.
