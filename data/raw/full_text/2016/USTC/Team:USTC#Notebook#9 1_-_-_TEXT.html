Recorder: Tianshu Liu Transformation of recombinant plasmid of sfGFP1-10 & PSB1A3         Materials:         recombinant plasmid of sfGFP1-10 & PSB1A3         LB media       competent cells (E.coli Top 10)
Procedure:
Put competent cells on ice. Then pre-chill by placing the tubes on ice.         Pipet the recombinant plasmid into competent cell tubes, 10 µL for each.         Flick the tube gently with your finger to mix. Incubate on ice for 30 minutes. Pre-heat waterbath now to 42°C.         Heat-shock the cells by placing into the waterbath for 90 seconds. Be careful to keep the lids of the tubes above the water level, and keep the ice close by.         Immediately transfer the tubes back to ice, and incubate on ice for 5 minutes. This helps the cells recover.         Add 1000 µL of LB media per tube, and incubate at 37°C for 1 hours.         Centrifuge the tube at 4000 rpm for 1 minutes, make the bacteria deposit at the bottom of the tube.         Discard 800 μL supernatant liquid and resuspend the bacteria.       Coat plate: add the solution to plate (Ap+) and spread it, respectively, then cultivate it overnight.

We examined the sequence of the SUP35NM-sfGFP11 ligation, and the results show that we succeeded. Now we should do the site mutation to make it work.
Date: 9.6
Recorder: Kaiyue Ma
The site mutations of the SUP35NM-sfGFP11 ligation succeeded.       We did one of the site mutations to eliminate the stop codon in the middle, and did the other to eliminate the PstI site in the middle.
Recorder: Chenyang Li, Yinchenguang Lyu , Xuefeng Meng,Ya Jiang ,Chengle Zhang etc. During the date 8.21-9.6,we accomplished the following experiments:         1. Ligation of AD/BD and SUP35NM in pSB1C3 plasmid;         2. Site mutations of the SUP35NM-AD/BD ligation .         (One of the site mutations is aimed to eliminate the stop codon in the middle, and the other to eliminate the PstI site in the middle.)         3. Double digestion of combinant pSB1C3 plasmid of AD/BD and SUP35NM with EcoRI and PstI. Ligation of the digestion product and plasmid PYeScGAP that is digested with the same enzyme.         4. Ligation of pGal1-GFP and plasmid PYeLGAP/pSB1C3 that are both digested with EcoRI and PstI.       5. Site mutation of the ligation product in 4 which is aimed at eliminating the stop codon in the middle.

To verify the split GFP can function as our expectation, we transform the plamids containing sfGFP1-10 and the plamids containing sfGFP11 respectively in BL21, cultivating the bacteria at 37°C and shacking at 250 rpm/min overnight. We use fluorescence microscope to observe bacterias under 100X objective lens.
