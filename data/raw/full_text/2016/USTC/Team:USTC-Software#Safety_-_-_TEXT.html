What is your chassis organism?
USTC-Software is a software-developing team, we manipulate only codes instead of wet-lab things, hence there is no biohazard and bio-safety problem.
Do you plan to experiment with any other organisms, besides your chassis?
We won't do experiments in lab, because USTC-Software is a software team.
How will your project work?
Our software will be running on the computer.
What risks does your project pose at the laboratory stage? What actions are you taking to reduce those risks?
Our project aims at helping biologists with their work by a software we designed, and won't use any bacteria or their plasmids.
How would your project be used in the real world?
USTC-Software is a software-developing team, we manipulate only codes instead of wet-lab things, hence there is no biohazard and bio-safety problem.
What risks might your project pose, if it were fully developed into a real product that real people could use? What future work might you do to reduce those risks?
As our project is a software, I think anyone who use it should read our guidebook. Moreover they should obey the rules of lab.
