SAFETY
The future progress for the design of RNA thermometers entails working in conjunction with a biology student who has a strong background in modeling at the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth. The expression levels detected during spectramax analysis will be associated to specific synthetic DNA sequences and relayed for modeling purposes. The modeling will take various factors into consideration including disappearance rate, complimentary bonding strength, as well as many other factors. The information gained from modeling will be used to optimize the synthetic DNA sequences to create RNA thermometers which will function within a very small temperature such as a single degree Celsius. Precise, accurate, and fully functional RNA thermometers can be further used in industrial processes for specific protein production.
