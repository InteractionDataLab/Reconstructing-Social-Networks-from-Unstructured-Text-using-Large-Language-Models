SAFETY
The UMass Dartmouth iGEM team was formed in May of 2016. It began with the creation of the Synthetic Biology club, lead by undergraduate bioengineering students Austin Nykiel, Alexander Halliwell, Kevin Beshara-Flynn, and biology student Shao-Chieh Chen. Under the guidance of Dr. Christopher Brigham and Jacob Palmer, M.S., the group decided to dive into the scarcely studied waters of RNA thermometers. As the group pursued its research, it was met with the addition of several more undergraduate students looking to contribute to the project.
