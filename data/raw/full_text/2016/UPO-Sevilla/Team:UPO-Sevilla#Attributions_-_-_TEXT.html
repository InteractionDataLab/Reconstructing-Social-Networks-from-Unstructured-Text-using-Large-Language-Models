AKNOWLEDGEMENTS
We want to thank our instructors for their support and trust. Thanks to Rafael R. Daga for organizing all events, for being responsible of the bureaucracy (which is not little), and for helping us be a real team. Thanks to Fernando Govantes for teaching us all about P. putida and biofilms and for helping us in our experiments, always in a good mood. Thanks to Alejandro Cuetos for his help in both modeling tools and for giving so nice ideas for our project. Thanks to Norberto Díaz for his help in the construction of the web and YouTube pages. Without you, we wouldn’t have been able to live this amazing experience (and our power point would have been a disaster)!
Thanks to the Universidad Pablo de Olavide (Sevilla) and the Facultad de Ciencias Experimentales for allowing us participate in this and for helping us organizing most of Human Practices events. Specially, thanks to Bruno, C.viral, Zeiss and Biomol for trusting us and supporting us. We are very grateful.
We also would like to thank all people who helped us in the lab (including previous iGEM members) and our family and friends for encouraging us when our experiments didn’t work.
