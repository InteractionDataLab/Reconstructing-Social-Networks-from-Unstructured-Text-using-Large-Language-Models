Migration to pSB1C3
Kit minipreps of the inocula put yesterday.
Digestion of the minipreps with NotI to see the inserts sizes. All constructs had some positive when seen in the electrophoresis gel.
Second digestion performed to confirm the construcions.
Electrophoresis gel from the positives digested. All of them were positives.
As the minipreps where from the kit, measure of the DNA concentration and dilution until 25 ng/ul.

Migration to pSB1C3
Inocula of the transformation of Pm with pMRB1 (six candidates).
Inocula of 146, 152, 126 and epimerase from the transformations of the ligations of them with C3 (four candidates each).
Plate Tn7-nahR-Psal-glpF and Tn7-nahR-Psal-nasF-glpF.
Measuring of DNA concentration of parts BBa_K1973005, BBa_K1973031, BBa_K1973032, and dilution to 25 ng/ul.
Transformation of the DNA of positive from ligation of 122 with C3.

18th October
Migration to pSB1C3
Kit minipreps of the inocula from the ligations.
Diagnostic digestion with NotI to see insert sizes (146, 126, 152 and epimerase).
Diagnostic digestion with EcoRI-HindIII to see if Pm ligation with pMRB1 gone well.
Electrophoresis gel to see the results of both digestions (126 and 152 were negative. We cannot send them to the registry, and the ligation with Pm also was negative).
Second diagnostic digestion with EcoRI and EcoRV of the positives from first digestion.
Electrophoresis gel to see the results.
Dilution of the positives’ DNA until 25 ng/ul (parts BBa_K1973030 and BBa_K1973017).
Inocula of Tn7-nahR-Psal-glpF, Tn7-nahR-Psal-nasF-glpF, and 122.

19th October
Migration to pSB1C3
Kit miniprep of Tn7-nahR-Psal-glpF, Tn7-nahR-Psal-nasF-glpF and 122 inocula.
Measure of DNA concentration of these minipreps and dilution to 25 ng/ul.
