OUR TEAM
Welcome to our little family
Our team is divided into three parts: dry lab, wet lab and communication. We are a multidisciplinary group from two universities that are willing to do its best to produce an amazing project. Do you want to meet us?
DRY LAB
Alejandro Cuetos
Hi, I'm Alejandro Cuetos, lecturer on Chemical  Physics Area. I am not sure why I am working  with Bacteria, but I am finding  it very funny. I am the supervisor of the modeling part  of the project, where we are learning very interesting things  about how to predict the biofilm behavior.
Francisco Javier Lobo
Hi, there!!  I'm Francisco Javier Lobo, one of the members of the dry lab. I love Microbiology and Programming, so when they asked me to join I jumped in with both feet (and  a computer). I think  the iGEM competition is an opportunity to interact with people from all over the world. See you all!
Norberto Díaz
I'm Norberto Díaz, Dean of the School of Engenieering at Pablo de Olavide University. I'm member of this excelent group as a tutor of dry lab - communication.
Israel León
Hi! I am Israel  León, a student of the Information Systems  Engineer Degree in University Pablo de Olavide. I don’t quite understand what biotechnlogy is, but I love this project and its complexity. I hope you find it as funny as I do!
WET LAB
José Martín
Hello everyone! I'm José, a recent biotech graduate, and I'm really amazed by the potential of synthetic biology. I'm a member of the wetlab group  and responsible for the propionate module. Let's make iGEM 2016 an unforgettable experience together!
Laura Claret
Hi! I'm Laura Claret, a graduate student of the Biotechnology Degree in our University. I'd never thought I would be selected for such a cool thing as iGEM, but here I am, in charge  of half the workload of the Micro Wet Lab. Hope you find our project as bewildering as I do!
Álvaro Escobar
Hi iGEMers and current people!  I'm Alvaro and I'm a biotechnologist. I think  I'm a funny and peaceful  guy, and I love making jokes. I can not yet believe that  I was chosen  to have the opportunity of being part  of the iGEM contest. I'm excited for being in touch with teams of the whole world, and I’m looking forward to explaining our fantastic project to everyone. See you at Boston!
Rafa R. Daga
Rafael R. Daga was born  in Malaga (Spain). He studied Biology in the Faculty of Science, University of Malaga and graduated on 1991. He received  his Ph.D. in 1999 in Genetics in the same University. He did his postdoctoral works in the CSIC/University of Salamanca (Spain), Columbia University and Rockefeller University (New York, EEUU). In 2006 he joined  the University Pablo de Olavide in Seville (Spain) where,  since 2009, he is full professor. Since 2008 he has his own laboratory in the Andalusian Centre  for Developmental Biology (CABD) in Seville. In 2010 he participated as instructor in iGEM with the UPO-Sevilla  team  and presented the project entitled Bacterial Crowding.
Gabriel Ruiz
Hi! I am Gabriel Ruiz. I am a 21 years old student of Biotechnology at Pablo de Olavide University. When our teacher told us about  making an iGEM team,  I would have never thought I would be selected to be part  of it! I’m so grateful and excited, as synthetic biology is one of my two passions, apart from cinema. I would love to direct  a movie about  iGEM!
Fernando Govantes
And this would be me… Over the years evolved to be called Fernan and then  Fer... I may end up losing my name  altogether. I am the grandfather of the team  and I run the Biofilms subteam. Best known  for my secular knowledge on bacterial strain genotypes, transposons and other  genetic  gimmicks, and for being the keeper of legendary protocols and media  recipes.
COMMUNICATION
Maite González
My name  is Maite but everyone calls me May. I am studying Journalism at the Sevilla university since 2013. I just finished my third year of my career  and I am very passionate about  it. My hobbies are the photografy and audiovisual creations like short-films and spot. I really love the literature, the videogames and the Science fiction too. I am interested in the popularizing of science so I think  it is something very important in the last years to communicate new scientific  advances. I consider myself a creative, fun and very sociable person so I am always delighted to participate in new projects. Nice to meet you.
