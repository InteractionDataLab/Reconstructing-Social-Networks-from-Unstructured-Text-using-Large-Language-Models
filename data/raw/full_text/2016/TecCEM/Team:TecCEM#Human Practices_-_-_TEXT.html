Human Practices.
Self-medication is one if the main                                           ways in which a bacteria can develop                                           multi-resistance. In Mexico City more                                           than 50% of adults have resorted to                                           this practice. (OPS, 2008)
Thatâ€™s why iGEM TEC-CEM decided                                                 to implement a three stages                                                 campaign in order to inform and                                                 persuade people to quit this habit.
