Medal Requirements
Bronze Medal
1.    Register for iGEM, have a great summer, and attend the Giant Jamboree.
Igem TecCEM 2016 registered as an “undergraduate team” and we had fun all the summer! By working in the summer we became more united!
2.    Meet all deliverables on the Requirements page. (Section 3)
We completed all the deliverables, such as: Team Wiki , project attribution , registry parts pages , safety forms and judging form. The poster and presentation will be displayed at the Giant Jamboree.
3.    Create a page on your team wiki with clear attribution of each aspect of your project.
The page of Atributtions , has detailed information about the work done by the members, advisor’s and instructors of the team, as well as all the people who made this project possible.
4. Document at least one new standard Biobrick Part or Device central to your project and submit this part to the iGEM Registry. You may also document a new application of a Biobrick part from a previous iGEM year
For TecCEM iGEM team project, which has its basis in fusion proteins, the documentation of a central part of the project was in order, and so, the documentation of BBa_K1904003 was made and sent to the Registry in the appropriate backbone. Also the characterization of a lambda lysozyme (BBa_K1362011) was performed. Specific part details can be found on our iGEM parts registry page and our Parts Page .
Silver Medal
1.    Experimentally validate that at least one new Biobrick Part or Device of your own design and construction works as expected. Document the characterization of this part in the Main Page section of that Part's/Device’s Registry entry.
The team documented it´s own creation biobrick BBa_K1904005 , Induction and solubility analysis were performed with a circuit comprised by BBa_R0011 and BBa_K1904005 . This biobrick was also put through MIC essay.
2.    Convince the judges you have helped any registered iGEM team from  high school, a different track, another university, or another institution in a significant way by, for example, mentoring a new team, characterizing a part, debugging a construct, modeling/simulating their system or helping validate a software/hardware solution to a synbio problem.
This year we collaborated with several iGEM teams around the world.                          For more information, In the page of Collaborations , is described all the collaborations with other iGEM teams in differents areas.
3.    iGEM projects involve important questions beyond the lab bench, for example relating to (but not limited to) ethics, sustainability, social justice, safety, security, and intellectual property rights. Demonstrate how your team has identified, investigated, and addressed one or more of these issues in the context of your project. Your activity could center around education, public engagement, public policy issues, public perception, or other activities (see the human practices hub for more information and examples of previous teams' exemplary work).
Gold Medal
1.    Expand on your silver medal activity by demonstrating how you have integrated the investigated issues into the design and/or execution of your project.
Further than spreading our love for science and our passion for making a change, our main objective is to share what we have developed in the laboratory with our community, because regardless of the size of our contribution, it can generate great changes. We focused on prevention and awareness of self-medication, which is one of the most practiced habits without concerning its consequences. Our target was the whole society, from children to elderlies, since the oldest are the ones who instruct the young people, the ones that represent our future generations. In order to generate a huge impact, we carried out a rally for kids, a campaign in a busy park with several activities, a documental with the opinion of experts and a small cinema related to science.  For more information, visit the Integrated Human practices page .
2.    Improve the function OR characterization of an existing BioBrick Part or Device and enter this information in the Registry. Please see the Registry help page on how to document a contribution to an existing part.
The function of part BBa_K112805 was improved by TecCEM 2016, given that the original part was not in a RFC that not allowed protein engineering, the part was optimized for Escherichia coli and modified to be a RFC 25 Freiburg N-part, The new code for improved the biobrick is BBa_K1904004 .
