iGEM XMU
A  complete mathematical model that predict the rate of production of toxin mRNA and toxin molecules as well as productive cells inside the system of their project was made, Taking in consideration some elements of their project a mathematical model using differential equations was designed to approach the number of viable cells within the toxic environment once the iGEM XMU circuit has been activated.
iGEM Aachen/ Sheffield/ NCTU_Formosa
A video was filmed by different teams to demonstrate that people from all over the world are gathered to work on the same passion that is synthetic biology to contribute with different projects (regardless their approach) to reach a better world and to improve scientific research.
iGEM Aachen survey
A survey was organized by iGEM Aachen team to compare the knowledge and the experience about genetic engineering in different countries. We strongly participated by answering to 72 surveys applied to mexican people.
iGEM Costa Rica
Several Wet Lab protocols were shared among our teams, promoting and encouraging scientific collaboration among iGEM teams and nations.
iGEM EPFL
A collaboration in igem.today project was made, with information about our proyect and our team, aswell as  difusion of the page to help the proyect reach as many public as possible.
