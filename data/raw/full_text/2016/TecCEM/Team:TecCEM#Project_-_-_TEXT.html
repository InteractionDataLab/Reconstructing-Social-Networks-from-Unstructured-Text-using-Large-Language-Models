Description
Acinetobacter baumannii is a pathogenic and opportunistic bacterium responsible for infections in hospitals amongst patients at ICUs. Nowadays, it has drawn attention due to its ability to acquire resistance to commonly used antimicrobials. This year, iGEM TecCEM 2016 team is developing a novel and specific method to avoid Acinetobacter baumannii proliferation onto nonliving surfaces, through cell wall lysis by formulating a disinfectant driven by endolisins. Its purpose, the sanitization of surgery and nursery equipment as well as potential transmission vector objects.
Our work.
