BBa_K1904005 Overview
The flagship part of our project is K1904005, a fused A. baumanii endolysin with an E. coli holin engineered in RFC25, coupled to B0015 (double terminator), B0034 (RBS) and a C-terminal histidine tag for high quality purification and minimal changes to tertiary structure. The lack of promoter allows the user to assess specific needs in terms of production. Also, its design based on K1904002 and K1904004 sums up to the catalogue of RFC25, increasing the possibilities of fused protein design.
