Characterization of K1362011
The characterization of R0011 + K1362011 was performed to obtain quantitative results of the action method of the biobrick BBa_K1362011. In order to make the characterization, induction,  dilution and antibiogram essays were carried out to determine the lambda lysozyme ability to lyse cells.

The transformation of R0011 + K1362011 was performed in BL21 competent cells, to assure the plasmid had the biobrick a Colony PCR was made, figure 1 shows the plasmid being amplified by VRF primers, wells 6 and 7 show the correct band amplified at approximately 800 bp.  The first induction and solubility analysis (figure 2) could not conclude the presence of the protein because the gel was not the correct percentage for the kilodaltons of the  protein (approximately 17 kDa). To obtain conclusive results induction and solubility analysis were repeated and runt in a 15% acrylamide SDS-PAGE (figure 3 and 4). The Characterization essay was performed according our Characterization Protocol, the results are listed in Table 1, but since the OD results were too high the protocol was repeated in order to obtain trustworthy results listed in Table 2. This dilutions were plated in LB plates as we can see in figure 4, 5, 6 and 7, it can be seen that the number of colonies diminishes a lot as we increased the quantity of our protein extract. Antibiograms with the protein extract were made (figure 6), in this figure is show the growth inhibition of J04450 transformed cells near the protein extract, we can see as well a little increase in the inhibition halo as the protein extract increases.
In conclusion after the dilutions and antibiogram analysis of the plates of the R0011 + K1362011 characterization, the values of MIC and MBC could be calculated, the MIC values were concluded as the concentration in which there is no visual growth and the MBC is the lwhere there was almost no growth at all, this values were delivered as MIC of 250uL and MBC of 600uL of proteic extract.
Documentation of Parts
WELK and NNQW are  the most important parts of the project, for this we did several protocols just to document this parts. WELK is the holine that helps us destabilize the peptidoglycan layer and NNQW is the composite part of WELK and E3D0 (the holine and the endolysin).

The documentation of the parts of our project, specifically BBa_K1904003 was made through Colony PCR, to validate the results of the colony PCR shown in fig 2 a digestion of the amplicon with (X+P) was made fig 3, where in the first well we can observe the expected weight of the insert (aprox 830 bp), therefore confirming the presence of our biobrick.
