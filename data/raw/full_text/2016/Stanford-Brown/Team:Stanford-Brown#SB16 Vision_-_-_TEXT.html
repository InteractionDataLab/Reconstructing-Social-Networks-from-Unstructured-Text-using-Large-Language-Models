Abstract
Exploration, both on Earth and beyond, requires putting instrumentation into atmospheres. Traditionally balloons have been ideal tools for atmospheric research: to track weather patterns, wind patterns, and to monitor atmospheric composition. Our team is working to create a biological balloon that is light, biodegradable, and both continuously and sustainably produced. To make the balloon itself, we are engineering bacteria to produce membrane polymers with different properties of strength and elasticitiy. To inflate the balloon, we are using algae to produce biological hydrogen to fill the balloon. To increase balloon durability, we are looking for biological ways to make our materials radiation resistant. Finally, to functionalize our balloon we are creating biological temperature and small molecule sensors. When combined to form a biological balloon these projects could create a completely novel category of scientific instrument: cheap, light, durable, and useful.
