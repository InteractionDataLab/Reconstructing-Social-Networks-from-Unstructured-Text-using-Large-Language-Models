This summer, our team has been working towards building a sensing balloon made of biomaterials. Traditionally balloons have been ideal tools for atmospheric research: they can track weather patterns and monitor atmospheric composition. Our bioballoon could be used to traverse long distances and collect data in hard-to-reach places on other planets, complementing a rover's capabilities. The bioballoon could be “grown” and re-grown with the same bacteria, dramatically reducing the cost of transport and production. We have been engineering bacteria to produce balloon membrane polymerswith different properties of strength and elasticity. We have used algae to produce biological hydrogen that could inflate the balloon. We have engineered bacteria to produce radiation resistant materials that would increase balloon durability. Finally, we have been working on biological thermometers and small molecule sensors that could attach to our balloon's surface. Together, these projects could create a novel scientific instrument: cheap, light, durable, and useful to planetary scientists. Our balloon is not just for outer space. It can be used to collect data on Earth, as well. Each of our balloon subcomponents has independent applications. For example, this summer we made a biological thermometer sticker that changes color when placed on a hot flask. We also successfully engineered bacteria to produce natural latex.
