Problem: a lighter-than-air balloon
To be a useful tool, the bioballoon must be made of something (membranes), it must inflate (float), and it must do something (sensors). In the float sub-project, we aimed to show that it was plausible to use biological means to produce the hydrogen gas that our balloon would require to inflate. Towards this end, we used the naturally gas-producing algal species Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. To read about this project, and see a latex balloon inflate with this bio-produced gas, see the gas production sub-project page.
