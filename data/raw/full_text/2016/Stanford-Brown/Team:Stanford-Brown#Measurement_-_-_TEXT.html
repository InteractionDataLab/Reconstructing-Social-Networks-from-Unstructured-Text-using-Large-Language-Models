There are a lot of exciting Parts in the Registry, but many Parts have still not been characterized. Synthetic Biology needs great measurement approaches for characterizing new parts, and efficient new methods for characterizing many parts at once. If you've done something exciting in the area of Measurement, describe it here!

Proteins have long been known to respond differently to thermal fluctuations in their environment. Through our research, we identified a cassette of chromoproteins that by either losing or changing their color, specifically indicate the temperature of their environment. This color change is also highly sensitive in a range of temperatures for each chromoprotein, providing a fast method for measuring the temperature in a sample. By characterizing the color degradation of each chromoprotein, we are able to produce a novel biological tool for measuring temperature in a standardized manner. Additionally, no extensive research has characterized these color-temperature profiles before. Having quantified the color expression profile dependency on temperature of each chromoprotein, we incorporated unique chromoproteins into a cassette of multiple chromoproteins. Through this cassette, we are able to expand beyond a single chromoprotein’s range of detection to measure a wider range of temperatures via using each chromoprotein’s characteristic color-temperature degradation curve.
