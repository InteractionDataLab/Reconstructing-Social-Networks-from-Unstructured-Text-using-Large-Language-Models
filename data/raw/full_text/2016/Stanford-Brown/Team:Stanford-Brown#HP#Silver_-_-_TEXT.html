For the human practices component of our project, we first investigated the practical and ethical challenges of deploying our balloon into space.  The most important challenge we ran into was the problem of planetary protection: making sure that our balloon would not contaminate the areas we explored.  We met with several experts in space exploration at NASA who helped us think about how we might design our balloon to be most useful to planetary scientists while also taking precautions against contamination.  These conversations framed our project design. To learn more please visit our main project page here
• Experimentally validate that at least one new BioBrick Part or Device of your own design and construction works as expected (see BBa_K2027001 ). Document the characterization of this part in the Main Page section of the Registry entry for that Part/Device. This working part must be different from the part you documented in Bronze medal criterion #4. Submit this part to the iGEM Parts Registry.
• Collaborate with another registered iGEM team in a significant way. Learn about our collaboration with Exeter here.
• Identify, investigate, and address human practices issues in the context of our project. iGEM projects involve important questions beyond the bench, for example relating to (but not limited to) ethics, sustainability, social justice, safety, security, and intellectual property rights. We refer to these activities as Human Practices in iGEM. Demonstrate how your team has identified, investigated and addressed one or more of these issues in the context of your project (see the Human Practices Hub for more information). Learn about our sustainability work on our practices page.
