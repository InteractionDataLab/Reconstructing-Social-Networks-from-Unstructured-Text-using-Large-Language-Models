In collaboration with the Stanford High Altitude Ballooning Team, we field tested our AE Blue-CBD fusion protein at a high altitude. This AE Blue-CBD fusion protein was extracted from the cells that were expressing it and purified using dialysis to ensure that only the fusion protein remained for this experiment. Prior to the flight we obtained permission from the US Environmental Protection Agency and iGEM HQ. It is important to note that nothing living was sent into the environment to be tested and that our sample was recovered. No environmental contamination occurred as a result of this experiment.

The balloon conditions were collected in real-time here: http://habmc.stanfordssi.org/
We plan on including future payloads on a World View Superballoon or possibly on our bioballoon
