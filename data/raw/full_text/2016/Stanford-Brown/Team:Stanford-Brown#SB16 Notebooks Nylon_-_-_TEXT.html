Project: iGEM 2016
Authors: Michael Becich, Elias Robinson
Dates: 2016-06-29 to 2016-07-11
Wednesday, 6/29
-Cryostocked E. coli strains (eAKP-71 and eAKP-744) expressing enzymes from biosynthesis pathway for 6-Aminocaproic Acid from Stefan Turk (DSM Food Specialties B.V., Netherlands) arrived to the lab
-Made four liquid cultures, half incubated at 37C at 220 rpm to stimulate rapid division and plasmid copy, and half at room temp and ~60 rpm to optimize effectiveness of oxygen sensitive chain elongation enzymes (AksD/E complex)
Thursday, 6/30
-Miniprepped plasmids from eAKP-71 and eAKP-744 (Elias)
-Ordered primers for PCR amplification of promoters, RBSs, and operons.
Monday, 7/11
