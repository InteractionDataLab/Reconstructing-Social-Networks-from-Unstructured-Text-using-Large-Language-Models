Human Practices lead Amy introduces the human practices component of the project
Human Practices
In our human practices section, we investigated the economic, social, environmental, etc. applications of biomanufacturing. We talked to experts in astrobiology to get a sense of how this balloon might be used in that community. In addition, we talked to companies at various stages of commercializing different biomanufacturing processes: from small start-ups to Genentech, currently the largest biomanufacturing operation in the world. We then examined what we learned and tried to extrapolate our findings to the context of our latex production process. To read about these efforts, see the Integrated Human Practices and Interviews sub-project page. The other main component of our human practices was educational in nature: the team presented at both the Bay Area and New York City World Maker Faires to help educate the public about the work that we did and about synthetic biology more generally. To read more about that and our other outreach activities, see the Outreach sub-project page.
Logos of different organizations we talked to so we could better understand the potential real-world implications of our work.
