We took our human practices project further by investigating the impact that our ability to produce latex in bacteria might have on traditional manufacturing practices.  We met with a variety of experts at Stanford and in Silicon Valley who helped us think through the real feasibility and potential environmental impact of this technology.  Hopefully our published reflections will help provide a critical perspective on use of this technology.  (We also integrated our discussions with NASA researchers about planetary protection and balloon functionality back into our balloon design.)

Teams work with students and advisors from the humanities and social sciences to explore topics concerning ethical, legal, social, economic, safety or security issues related to their work. Consideration of these Human Practices is crucial for building safe and sustainable projects that serve the public interest.
For more information, please see the Human Practices Hub .
Please see our main website Medal Requirements Page for the functional links.  • Expand upon silver medal human practices activity by integrating the investigated issues into the design and/or execution of our project. Learn about our sustainability work here. • Improve the function or characterization of an existing BioBrick Part of Device and enter it in the Registry. The part cannot be from our 2016 part number range. Learn how we improved 2014 Stanford-Brown-Spelman's Cellulose Cross-linker. • Demonstrate functional proof of concept of our project; must consist of a BioBrick device, not a single BioBrick part (Remember, biological materials may not be taken outside the lab). Check out our biodevice for a cellulose-based ATP Biosensor. • Show our project working under real-world conditions by demonstrating that our functional proof of concept can work under simulated lab conditions (Remember, biological materials may not be taken outside the lab). Learn about how we tested our Chromoproteins in the upper-atmosphere here.
