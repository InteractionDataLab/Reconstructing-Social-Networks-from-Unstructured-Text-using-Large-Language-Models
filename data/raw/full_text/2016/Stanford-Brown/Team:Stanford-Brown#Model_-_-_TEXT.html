Modeling
In order to augment our capabilities in vitro, we developed in silico tools to model our systems. Using Python and MATLAB, we developed 1) a elementary flux analysis tool for metabolic engineering of the Shikimate Pathway in E. coli and 2) a balloon simulator to give rise to the possibilities of our project.
