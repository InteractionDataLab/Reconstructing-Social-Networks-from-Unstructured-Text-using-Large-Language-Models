Project support and advice
Yuehua Cheng
Mr Cheng is a law consultant of medicine who offered us a lot of advises. We discussed with him about the safety of synthetic as well as nowadays and further application of synthetic biology and genetic modified.
After the discussion, we had deeper understanding of the situation and application of synthetic biology and GM in China.
Yufei Zhang
Yufei Zhang, a student major in biology in South China Agricultural University, who has been taken part in iGEM 2014.
She gave us some lessons about synthetic biology and genetic engineering. She was able to make it easy to understand for us.
On the other hand, she patiently helped us in the lab. She helped us to decide and buy the reagents that were to be used. She also reminded us some safety criterion throughout the project execution.
Honglei Jin
Honglei Jin is a young professor of biology in SUN YAT-SEN University. He guided us throughout the whole training, from project selecting, project initialization management to program construction. And he gave us some useful suggestions of the project, and the idea of our project originally generated by what he had done.
Besides, he gave us some lessons about molecular biology as well as the safety of lab.

Difficult technique support
SCAU China iGEMâ€“wiki support
This summer, we contacted with iGEM team SCAU-China and had a meeting with them. In the meeting, the members of SCAU-China shared us some experience about team building, doing experiments, building models and making wiki.
And we learnt about that in their project, rice was used as the material to produce astaxanthin, which was supposed to be an economic way to produce astaxanthin. They wanted to know what will be the cost of the astaxanthin and we also had an interest on this, so we proposed to make a comparison of the costs for astaxanthin productions in different method. Finally, we could find that rice could be a great kind of material to produce astaxanthin because it could lower the price of astaxanthin greatly and made astaxanthin more accessible to the public.
