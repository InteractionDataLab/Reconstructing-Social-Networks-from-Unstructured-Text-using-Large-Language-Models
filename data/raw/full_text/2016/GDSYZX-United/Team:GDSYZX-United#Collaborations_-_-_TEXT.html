This summer, we contacted with iGEM team SCAU-China and had a meeting with them. In the meeting, the members of SCAU-China shared us some experience about team building, doing experiments, building models and making wiki.   And we learnt about that in their project, rice was used as the material to produce astaxanthin, which was supposed to be an economic way to produce astaxanthin. They wanted to know what will be the cost of the astaxanthin and we also had an interest on this, so we proposed to make a comparison of the costs for astaxanthin productions in different method. Finally, we could find that rice could be a great kind of material to produce astaxanthin because it could lower the price of astaxanthin greatly and made astaxanthin more accessible to the public.
