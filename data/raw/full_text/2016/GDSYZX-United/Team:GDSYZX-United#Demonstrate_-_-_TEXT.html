The trascription level of HHL1 in transgentic Arabidopsis
In the compete transgenic Arabidopsis，the result is very similar. The transcription controlled by pHhl1 is also very low. However, under high light, the transcription  controlled by three photosensitive promoters are also very high, and the highest is phyB, and then is pCop1.
These suggested that our parts can also function in the compete plants, and the result is similar.

Photosynthetic efficiency in transgentic Arabidopsis
We transformed four vectors with stably expressions into Arabidopsis, then detected the photosynthetic efficiency of transgenic Arabidopsis.
  1）Under growth light condition, the chloroplast of the plants that transformed in four different vectors were not damaged, so the red fluorescence of the chloroplasts have no obvious difference and maintain a high level.
  2）However, under high light condition, the construction of chloroplasts were damaged in different level although the protein HHL1 exsist. So the red fluorescence of chloroplast had decreased, but the decrease level is quit different, the lower the fluorescence is, the stronger the damage is.
From the diagram we can know that the fluorescence of plants transformed with three photosensitive promoters are stronger than the promoter pHhl1, and the pPhyB is the strongest.And that plants transformed with promoter pPhyB, its photosensitive efficiency is the best and its photodamage is the lowest.
