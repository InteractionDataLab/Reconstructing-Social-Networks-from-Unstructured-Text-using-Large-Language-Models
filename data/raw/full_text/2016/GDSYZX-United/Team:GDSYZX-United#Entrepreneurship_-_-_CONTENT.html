Therefore, each member of GDSYZX-United has further understanding of life science, and they are more and more interest in life science, even treat it as their pursuit of life.</DIV><DIV class="text_font">This is the age of high technology, and the era of biological technology change the world is coming. Chinese people has stronger interest in synthetic biology.</DIV><DIV class="text_font">Genomics, one of the famous Chinese firm, which was founded in 2009. The value of this firm has up to RMB 20 billion, and this is the result of the confidence in Chinese biotechnology.</DIV><DIV class="text_font">Chinese students have strong enthusiasm for synthetic biology, biotechnology and genetic engineering. GDSYZX - United has shared experience of iGEM through science festival of Guangdong province experimental middle school and community activities. Indeed, they found out that high school students have a strong interest in synthetic biology, but a few of them know iGEM. Beside, there is no chance for them to get a better understanding of synthetic biology, therefore, it’s very necessary and significant for students to do experimental operation by themselves, and spread synthetic biology, life sciences and iGEM to them.</DIV><DIV class="text_font">Up to 35.64% of high school students in Guangzhou takes an interest in biology through the Human Practice investigation of GDSYZX – United.</DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="timeline-item"><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-sm-8 content"><DIV class="text_font"><STRONG>User analysis</STRONG></DIV><OL><DIV class="text_font"><LI style="text-indent:0em;"><FONT style="font-color:yellow"><FONT style="font-weight:bold">Users in China</FONT></FONT></LI></DIV><DIV class="text_font">According to the results of the 2016 National Economic and Social Development Survey by the National Bureau of Statistics, China now has 23,744,000 high school students, including 7,976,000 graduates and 7,966,000 new enrollments. For primary schools, China has 96,922,000 students with 14,372,000 graduates and 17,290,000 new enrollments.

In these provinces, the amount of high school students are 13,722,000, and nearly half of them are in the city.</DIV><DIV class="text_font">Estimation shows that 35.64% of high school students are interested in biology, which means 24,470,000 students would be our target users.
