There are operators in every part of our project in the following, some of them had already done very well,so we specilly add their email address behind thier name in case of other's needs. Specific contents as follows:
 
1.Team construction and management：
Team leader Li Jiamin(359673713@qq.com) constructed the SCAU-iGEM team under the help of honorary header and was in charge of all the work.
Chen Shuwen(865420439@qq.com) is responsible for attendance of meeting and message announcement. Lu Xin(409859596@qq.com) is responsible for team materials and fees.
 
2.Wetlab work
Li Jiamin(359673713@qq.com) ,as the general experiment leader, takes charge for transformation and detection as well as Cui Chaojun(2809891818@qq.com), Zhang Runzhao(1564917025@qq.com).
Chen Junyu(845134917@qq.com) and Guo Xiangyu(577931563@qq.com) are in charge of constructing vectors.
Lin Jiangbang(946413967@qq.com) have done the work about detection and safety.
 
3.Design
Wang Rong (741031805@qq.com):Wang Rong is the general leader of the design part, taking part in the the design and making of our team clothing, posters, wiki, team logo and the video.

Acknowledgement:
 
1.Students support
 
Zeng Dongchang (Master degree candidate):  Make an effort to teach us how to construct vectors and detect the expression of genes. Thus, help us to carry out experiments smoothly.
Weike Li (Honor student):  Play a leading role in the very beginning of our team-building process. Then, in the stage of brainstorming, not only help to collect oceans of data and references for us greenhands, but also point out the weakness of our idea and make suggestions. Finally, offer to improve the experimental methods. All in all, he is an X-man who works with us but cannot share success with us.(This is why we call him the honor student~)
 
2.Lab support
 
State Key Laboratory for Conservation and Utilization of Subtropical Agro-bioresources:    Our project mainly depends on Liu yaoguang Laboratory which belong to State Key Laboratory for Conservation and Utilization of Subtropical Agro-bioresources.This laboratory is mainly engaged in rice sterility molecular mechanisms and rice genetic engineering research. It is at the leading level in gene carrier construction and plant tissue culture.There is specialized field to grow genetically modified rice, and have maturescheme of rice cultivation and management. The laboratory has strict management in safety, including specialized processing of engineering bacteria and plants、 safe distance between genetically modified rices and  isolate the  field from the outside world.These methods make sure that our gm products won't cause pollution to the environment.    The lab provides us with great support.Including the provision of reagent ,instrument,strains and field to grow rice.What is more important is that provide us with technology to build a carrier and tissue culture system.
 
3.Human practices support
 
1.Teacher Jinhong Lai provides us with the pathway to apply for the scientific research projects which can be supported by our school and thus ensures our experiment budget.
 
2.Deputy secretary Dongmei He and Prof Letian Chen raise all kinds of fund for our team so that our project can move on smoothly.
 
3.Thanks to the youth league committee in the college of life sciences of SCAU, we can publicize some wonderful items related to iGEM among the freshmen.
 
4.Also, with the help of the youth league committee in the college of life sciences of SCAU, we can share a stall to exhibit some achievements of our projects to the public during the “ZiJing Festival” in our university.
 
5.The Secretary Department of Youth League Committee of College of Life Science organized the "Laboratory Open Day",we took the chance to show others about our own lab.
 
6.The Technical Department of Youth League Committee of College of Life Science provided us the opportunity to display and share our research work in the innovation and entrepreneurship career talk that over 300 people attended.
 
7.Professor and Dean of our college Deng Yiqun, Professor and Associate Dean of our college Hao Gang, Professor Wen Jikai, Professor Wang Haihong, Professor Wang Hao, Deputy Party Secretary He Dongmei made contribution to the evaluation of our project.
 
8.Thank you Professor Wang Hao for giving duidance to our PPT presentation .
