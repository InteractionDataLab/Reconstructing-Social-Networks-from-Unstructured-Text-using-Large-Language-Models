To tackle the first problem, kids designed a superhero that could shoot spiderwebs or fly to ultimately catch their friend. For the second problem, kids designed a super bacteria that could clean the ocean by detecting, degrading, or digesting oil. This activity served as a introduction of the possibilites of synthetic biology and genetic engineering.

They used a cell model made of wooden poles and color-coded parts that fit on the poles. Each color had a different function like red for production and blue for sensing. A visitor would pick a challenge card with an area of research on it ranging from making synthetic blood to treating malaria. Then she would make a cell that would solve the problem using a solution description on the back of the card. </P></DIV></DIV><DIV id="div-bistro" class="profiles center clearfix float-my-children"><DIV><P>Eat it? Think about it? No way? Visitors were introduced to a variety of engineered foods, both currently available and in development, and asked their opinion on consuming the goods. Items included vanilla flavoring, caffeine, and milk synthesized by yeast, a food pill that provided all daily nutrients, golden rice, and meat created in a lab. Participants were also introduced to different ways we have modified agriculture like selective breeding, genetic engineering, and synthetic biology.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV id="div-tech" class="profiles center clearfix float-my-children"><DIV><P> Visitors would be introduced to a wide range of applications for synthetic biology to start a conversation among the visitors on the level of importance of each application. Each visitor at the table was given a stack of colored coins to represent their opinion. They would place all their coins on the application(s) most important to them and then we would all discuss their choices and reasoning. An additional activity was to give each person at the table a character card with occupations ranging from president of the U.S. to Canadian college student. They would repeat the process of placing coins, but this time in the mindset of the occupation they were given. </P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV id="div-ours" style="display: none"><DIV class="margin"><TABLE id="table-selector2"><THEAD><TR><TH class="borderRight belowNav" id="th-bacteria" data-select="bacteria"><P>Build Your Own Bacteria</P></TH><TH class="borderBoth belowNav" id="th-broth" data-select="broth"><P>Make Your Own LB Broth</P></TH><TH class="borderLeft belowNav" id="th-color" data-select="color"><P>Colorful Creations</P></TH></TR></THEAD></TABLE></DIV><DIV class="div-content"><DIV id="div-bacteria" class="profiles center clearfix float-my-children"><DIV><P>This station combines science, art and play to present an analogy for synthetic biology. First, participants used legos to build their own plasmid, mixing and matching different parts. Different legos were used as an analogy for BioBricks, and contained pieces such as promoters and terminators. Visitors were able to pick what physical characteristics they wanted their bacteria to have, such as body color and number of legs, by picking the appropriate lego BioBricks. Then, participants were able to draw the bacteria they just built on our worksheet. </P></DIV></DIV><DIV id="div-broth" class="profiles center clearfix float-my-children"><DIV><P>How do scientists feed their bacteria? Visitors learned about LB broth and were able to make their own “imitation LB broth” by mixing lemonade powder and water. To make their mixture, participants weighed out the proper amount of powder using a scale and measured out the correct amount of water using beakers.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV id="div-color" class="profiles center clearfix float-my-children"><DIV><P>Science is an art!
