2nd Annual Mid-Atlantic Mini-Jamboree
July 22nd, 2016
UMaryland iGEM founded the first Mid-Atlantic Meet-up and hosted     four other teams: UVA, William and Mary, Duke, and Rock Ridge High School.    Each team gave a 25 minute presentation of their project followed by a Q&A    with the audience. We were also fortunate enough to have Special Agent    Edward You of the FBI and UMD Professor Raymond St. Leger as guest speakers.
This year we included more iGEM teams in the Mid Atlantic Area hosting the University of Pittsburgh, the US Naval Academy, the College of Willam and Mary, and University of Virginia iGEM Teams. We shared ideas and received feedback about ours projects during our discussion session. We were joined by guest speakers Dr. Eli Groban and Dr. Ganesh Sriram with opening remarks by Dr. Edward Eisenstein and closing remarks by Anna Sifuentes.
Thank you to everyone who participated!
