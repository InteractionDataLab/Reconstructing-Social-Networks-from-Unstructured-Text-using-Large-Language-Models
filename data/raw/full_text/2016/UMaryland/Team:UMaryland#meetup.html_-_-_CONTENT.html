			four other teams: UVA, William and Mary, Duke, and Rock Ridge High School.
			Each team gave a 25 minute presentation of their project followed by a Q&amp;A
			with the audience. We were also fortunate enough to have Special Agent
			Edward You of the FBI and UMD Professor Raymond St. Leger as guest speakers.</P><P class="pInfo">This year we included more iGEM teams in the Mid Atlantic Area hosting the University of Pittsburgh, the US Naval Academy, the College of Willam and Mary, and University of Virginia iGEM Teams. We shared ideas and received feedback about ours projects during our discussion session. We were joined by guest speakers Dr. Eli Groban and Dr. Ganesh Sriram with opening remarks by Dr. Edward Eisenstein and closing remarks by Anna Sifuentes.</P><P class="pInfo center">Thank you to everyone who participated!</P></DIV><DIV id="div-participants"><TABLE id="table-pictures"><TBODY><TR><TD><A href="https://2016.igem.org/Team:William_and_Mary" target="_blank"><P>William &amp; Mary</P></A></TD><TD><A href="https://2016.igem.org/Team:Pittsburgh" target="_blank"><P>University of Pittsburgh</P></A></TD><TD><A href="https://2016.igem.org/Team:USNA-Annapolis" target="_blank"><P>US Naval Academy</P></A></TD><TD><A href="https://2016.igem.org/Team:Virginia" target="_blank"><P>University of Virginia</P></A></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV><DIV id="Speakers" class="bios"><H2 id="h2-pic1"> Speakers </H2><DIV id="descriptions"><DIV id="div-ganesh" class="description"><H3> Dr. Ganesh Sriram</H3><P> Dr. Ganesh Sriram is a professor in the Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering and an Affiliate Faculty Member in the Bioengineering and Plant Biology graduate programs at UMD.
