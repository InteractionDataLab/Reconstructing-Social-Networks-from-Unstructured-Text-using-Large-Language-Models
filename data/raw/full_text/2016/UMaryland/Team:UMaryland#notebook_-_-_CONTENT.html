Many of the genes needed to create our plasmids are offered in the iGEM registry, but we realized that we would need to order some genes as GBlocks from IDT. We began to design GBlocks for the genes not offered in the registry (MMOY &amp; MMOZ subunits, MDH2, HPS, PHI), which was a new experience for most of our lab members, who had little experience creating parts for Gibson Assembly.</P><P class="p-text">This summer, we moved into a new lab space, so we had to set up the lab with all our equipment.

When running a gel of a restricted digest of the plasmid, we observed bands that were not expected. Additionally, we tried sequencing all our DNA recovered over the past few weeks and were disappointed to see only a few of our samples matched the expected sequences (RBS with MMOX and RBS with FDH).

                            Due to time limitations and difficulty with traditional 3A assemblies, we decided to take a different approach on cloning. Instead of sequentially digesting and ligating, we chose to start Gibson assemblies. We designed primers for each part, the forward having a gibson overhang, ribosome binding site, and annealing sequence and the reverse containing just an annealing sequence. Our G-blocks also came in, which were designed to be ready for a Gibson assembly with a backbone. We created stocks by transforming our resulting Gibson assemblies. We also had our first experience with PCR, as we wanted to try an alternative way to extract backbone. At the end of the week, we volunteered with Building with Biology in Port Discovery and explained the significance and applications of synthetic biology.
