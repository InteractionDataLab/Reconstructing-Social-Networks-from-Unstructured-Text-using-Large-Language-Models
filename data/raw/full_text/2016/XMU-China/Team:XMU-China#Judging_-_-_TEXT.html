Integrated Human Practices
We integrated our human project into our project >> E.coli soldiers VS pathogen .
Improve a previous part or project
We completed the project of 2014 WHU-China , improved their parts especially BBa_K1334015 , BBa_K1334016 and BBa_K1334017 and the system's function was confirmed.
Proof of concept
We verified our concept in the lab, and documented our result in the result page.
Demonstrate our work
We demonstrated how our system would work in real word in the application page. This part could also connected with the principle which you can found in the project page.
Silver Medal
Validated Part /Validated Contribution
We experimentally validated that our 8 new BioBricks worked as expect. The results can be viewed at registry page. The BioBricks are listed here:
BBa_K1960000 ,
BBa_K1960001 ,
BBa_K1960002 ,
BBa_K1960003 ,
BBa_K1960004 ,
BBa_K1960005 ,
BBa_K1960006 ,
BBa_K1960007 .
Collaborations
Collaborate not only for project, but also for human practice, helping them as we could. Our collaboration can be grouped into four classes as following:
Modelling: TecCEM .
Software test: SJTU-Software , HFUT-China .
Project: Lanzhou , Imperial_College , BGU_ISRAEL , Tel-Hai .
Human practice: LMU-TUM_Munich , Paris_Saclay , Virginia , Evry , METU_HS_Ankara , Exeter , Pasteur_Paris , Cornell_NY .
Human Practice
We conducted several human practice projects around our project and synthetic biology like questionnaire, interview, intercollegiate communication and newsletter .
Bronze Medal
Register and attend
We have finished Register form and attended the Giant Jamboree this October!
Deliverables
We have delivered our new BioBrick parts as required.
Attributions
We created a separated page on our wiki showing the attribution of each aspect clearly.
Part / Contribution
We documented new standard BioBrick parts and submitted them to the Registry.
In Addition
We validated 4 BioBricks registered:
BBa_K249003 Test Results ,
BBa_K801100 Test Results ,
BBa_K592015 Test Results ,
The result can be viewed clearly in parts experience pages.
