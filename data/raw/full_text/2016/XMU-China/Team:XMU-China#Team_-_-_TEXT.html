Introduction
There cannot be a good iGEM project without an excellent team! Our team consists of 16 creative students with interdisciplinary backgrounds from Xiamen University. All in all with joint forces and collective creativity, we will create something special in order to make our contribution to the fight against antibiotic-resistance. Scroll down the page and read about the individual team members.
