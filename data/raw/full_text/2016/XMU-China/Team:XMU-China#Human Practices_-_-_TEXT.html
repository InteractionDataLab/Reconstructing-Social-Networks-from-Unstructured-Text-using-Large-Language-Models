Reduce antibiotics abuse
The theme of our human practice is to reduce the abuse of antibiotics. We've expanded the project beyond the lab bench and done a lot of things. We completed Human Practices silver medal criteria , Human Practices gold medal criteria , Best Integrated Human Practices award and Best Education and Public Engagement award . We handed out bilingual questionnaires online and offline, conducted interviews, taught lessons in primary school, provided brochures to university students, gave out leaflets to villagers, communicated with other teams, attended SynBioBeta conference, signed up for first-aid lessons and hosted Newsletter . A broad range of issues including philosophy, public engagement/dialogue, education, ethics, safety and security, public policy, law and regulation (take intellectual property rights as an example), sustainability and social justice were practiced.
