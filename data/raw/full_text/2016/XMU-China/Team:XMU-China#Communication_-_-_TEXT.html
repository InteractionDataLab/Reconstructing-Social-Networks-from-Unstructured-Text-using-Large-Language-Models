Communication is so important in modern society and we did learn a lot by communicating with other iGEM teams.
Four teams’meeting
There was a meeting for SZU-China , SYSU-China , FAFU-CHINA and XMU-China in ShenZhen University in June. We got advice from the tutor of SZU-China who was familiar with iGEM competiton and had instructed SZU-China team for two years. He told us to design the circuit quickly and started the experiment as soon as possible. He also suggested that the improvement of an old part may be difficult, so we would better not take this as the main project. The student members of other three teams asked many questions about our project, which motivated us to consummate our project. We not only presented our project but discussed some issues about the judge criteria, human practice and experiments. We were illuminated a great deal from SZU-China’s methods of team management.
SUSTech-Shenzhen
We visited Southern University of Science and Technology and the interchange of ideas with SUSTech-Shenzhen enlightened both of us. Looking aroud the labs and seeing some advanced equipments broadened my horizon. Meanwhile, we provided some application prospects for their project.
NU_Kazakhstan
Two exchange students from nazarbayev university of Kazakhstan were studying in Xiamen University in September. It happened that one of them is a member of 2015 NU_Kazakhstan iGEM team while the other is a member of 2017 NU_Kazakhstan iGEM team. Nazarbayev university do not attend this year’s iGEM however. Our team hold a meeting to welcome them and shared our project. They gave us some advice about the use of our engineering bacteria in vivo and they presented their project for the 2017 iGEM competition.
UCAS
UCAS worked on degrading antibiotics which also focused on the solution of antibiotic resistant crisisis. One member of UCAS visited our university and we discussed hotly. The peptide they used to degrade to antibiotics, the hardware they produced to clean the drainage, the siRNA we used to knock out the gene and so on were all discussed. We learned much from each other.
EPFL
EPFL established a website where many teams shared their project description. XMU-China sent a project description to EPFL and accepted an interview through skype. During the interview, we answered their questions about project, team, impressions of iGEM, our city and so on. We both benefited a lot from the interview, on which we could have a better understanding of each other, not only on the project but also on our life.
TecCEM
We both try to kill antibiotic-resistant bacteria so we succeeded in helding a skype meeting although the time difference made the meeting a little difficult. They gave us some propositions about modeling and we helped them to take the human practice further.
Webinar
Accepted an invitation from the salt school, we attended the iGEM team iGEM's 1st official webinar which was delivered by William_and_Mary , the 2015 champion team. Two members shared the tips and tricks of synthetic biology outreach which elicited some positive effect to our human practice.
