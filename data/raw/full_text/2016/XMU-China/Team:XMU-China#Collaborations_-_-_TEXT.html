Tel-Hai
Tel-Hai shared their ideas on the publicity of synthetic biology with us. They are trying to explain what synthetic biology is in a fresh and more attractive way. That is to put together a trivia game, set of questions from groups doing multiple things. The questions potentially could be shared with local students not involved with the competition but who wish to learn more about synthetic biology and entrepreneurship in the field of biotechnology. To spread the game better and further and to make up the shortcoming that they cannot get the information about what we are doing before October, they need to collaborate with other teams. Once we received their email, we made effort to make a plan to show our understanding about our project and synthetic biology. Then considering Tel Hai’s advice, we finally collected the fun relevant stories and turned them into a range of questions, including the creative ideas in the experiment design, mistakes that should to be avoided. All the contents are collected to educate those who want to enter the stronghold of synthetic biology. Furthermore, we had a deeper understanding towards synthetic biology, which was helpful for us to dig deeper in our project through the collaboration.
What’s more, we sent them a photo where there is a rose. They were collecting 65 roses to make a picture serving their project. Attracted by their creativity, we decided to join their project in such an interesting way.
Imperial_College
This year, Imperial aimed to develop software to facilitate the design and optimization of co-cultures. The software will allow researchers and future iGEM teams to conveniently access co-culture protocols for the best practices in their own experiments providing information on appropriate pH, temperature, and inoculation ratios among other data. To help them check the data from their software, the XMU team used xxxx and accompanied software to measure bacterial quantity and OD600. We designed our co-culture plan to inspect the impact of pH and salinity. The goal of the collaboration is to get the microbial growth curve in different salinity and different pH. We sent our data back to Imperial to analysis.
BGU_ISRAEL
The XMU-China also collaborated with BGU_ISRAEL to provide them the background of current solutions for plastic waste in China. They aimed to provide a more eco-friendly way to degrade PET in the aspect of synthetic biology. And to show the advantages of the new method, they want to see the traditional solutions to the plastic. So we would tell them some information about how we deal with plastic, to help them go further in their project. Also, we investigate public’s attitude towards the issue.
Questionnaire
We tried to connect with more teams, and we found it an efficient way to understand a project by questionnaire. So we spread many questionnaires from other teams like LMU-TUM_Munich , Paris_Saclay , Virginia and Evry . iGEM Peshawar spread our survey which was found in the Newsletter by them. They used their contacts and social media platforms to reach out to more people. Their effort helped us to collect the foreign response. As return for our helpful work, Paris_Saclay, Virginia and Evry gave their badges:
We also appreciate it that Cornell_NY gave us great assistance in giving away our questionnaire.
Lanzhou
We helped them test their system providing them with TEM image of the bacteria. If their system works, there will be an apparent metal ion peak and protein peak in TEM image, which means their project can really deal with the mercury ion in the media. Otherwise, the system needs to be improved. As return, Lanzhou helped us to construct a BioBrick, BBa_K1960450 . Somehow we failed to finish this part. During the communication between us, Lanzhou was so warm-hearted to offer assistance to us. The BioBrick from them helped us a lot.
Translation
We collaborated with others not only in project but also in human practice. To assist other teams with their human practice, we played out our Chinese-speaking advantages to provide dome translation. We helped METU HS Ankara translate iGEM experiment protocols into Chinese. Besides, we contributed the spread of surveys of Exeter , Pasteur_Paris and Groningen by our translation. Among them, Groningen sent us a badge. In a word, XMU-China was making effort to push synthetic biology, an emerging discipline, to go further in China.
Software test and Modelling
We tested the software developed by SJTU-Software , which is expected to be an efficient tool for iGEMers, no matter for individuals or for teams. The software integrates calendar function, instrument appointment system into a social media. The function which impressed me most is its way to find the team nearby.
We also tested HFUT-China's software called BioDesigner Coral. They built it helping iGEM teams design and construct their device. Besides, BioDesigner Coral shows the relationship between genes, providing a reference of related genes. This function was expanded to the system recommendation, which provided a reference for the device designer.
Besides, we appreciate TecCEM for helping us in construct our Modelling . Because of the limited time, we got in trouble finishing our mathematical model. TecCEM gave a hand to us without hesitation once they saw the trouble in front us. Thanks to their assistance, our model can be shown on our wiki on time. They built the model to simulate the effect of sRNA towards pathogens. The first step was to
simulate the growth of the bacteria which produce sRNA. Multiplying a parmeter, the growth of the pathogens which was affected by sRNA can be shown. Finally, the growth curve of engineering bacteria should minus the curve of pathogens. On the basis of their effort, our project can be more complete and mathematically proved. Here, we sincerely thank them for their help.
Oxford
They sent us a BioBrick of great importance, the quorum sensing system of MRSA. Quorum sensing system was the key part in the detection of antibiotic resistance bacteria. With their help, our project can be more systematic and convincing.
EPFL
We had a skype meeting with them. They interviewed us about the drug-resistance. We show our project to them. With their spread, we found a new method to show our project wider by the collaboration, where we felt to be connected with more iGEMers. Sincerely thanks to their interview.
