In order to bring the pupils an interesting science popularisation lesson about the antibiotics,we carefully prepared for two weeks.When I saw the pupils really like our lesson, and they actively answered our questions about the antibiotics abuse ,I was happy that our efforts paid back. Through the human parctice, we let the pupils know the harm of the antibiotics abuse, which is very meaningful.

We came to the HengCuo Primary School in Xiamen City for holding a lecture of antibiotics using. After we arrived, the children really gave us iGEM team a overwhelming reception. They listened to our lecture really carefully, and when the speaker asking questions of antibiotics using, lots of small hands rose up immediately. Kids love cute things, so we made the performance of bacteria and antibiotics as big puppets in our stage play, and it really worked. I think that children are our past and future. Teaching them how to live with nature is so important. I hope that one day when they become adults and face the challenges of the environment and human living, they could contribute their wise heads and warm hearts.

In the process, what gives me the deepest impression is that an academic game can also be colorful, can take advantage of all the different and can creat a more multi-cultural environment.
Yuan Zhao:
I'm glad to participate in the tour in Xiangan, where we offered lectures and gived a display show. During preparing, we had a deeper understanding on our project. Also, it's good for the developement of newborn discipline and biosysthsis. I saw the internal relationship between science and public for the first time, which is really important.
Bing Chen:
This experience is unforgettable！I believe what we did is a seed of knowledge，love and hope to the children who have got not only joy but awareness of antibiotics overuse. And this also makes me feel that our project is meaningful. It deserves our hardwork.
Yuling Li：
Children’s curiosity is one of the best way to spread knowledge. I believe our lively and interesting class let children know some antibiotics related knowledge which will help them make the correct choices when using medication. Of course this is meaningful.
Summary of the Class in the primary school
For our human practice, we gave a lecture to pupils in a primary school. The theme of the lecture is “growing with health”. The content of this lecture mainly included: some simple introduction about bacterial, the strong immune system of humans, the abuse of antibiotic inducing the emergence of superbugs and some healthy lifestyle. During our lecture, we prepared an interesting short play and a video to make the lecture more vivid.
As a speaker, I was concerned that the knowledge is too difficult for them to understand. However, connecting knowledge with real life can solve this problem. So, during the lecture, I used many vivid examples to make them have a better understanding. At the same time, I also helped them to have a correct understanding about some conception. For example, many pupils thought that all the bacterial were harmful to us.  I took lactobacillus for an example to tell them that some bacterial are beneficial to us.
When we were talking about the abuse of antibiotic, we concerned that this section is boring for them, so we decided to prepare an interesting short play and we carefully prepared for two weeks. At last, we gave a wonderful performance with the help of some cute props. The pupils immersed themselves in our performance and learnt much knowledge at the same time.
The last section is prize-giving guess contest game. I asked some questions about my lecture. Many pupils were putting up their hands to answer the questions. This can be proved that they’ve really learnt a lot.
In a word, this activity is successful. It is believed that this activity brought them knowledge and happiness. We make them know how to live healthier in the future. This is what we want to achieve.
