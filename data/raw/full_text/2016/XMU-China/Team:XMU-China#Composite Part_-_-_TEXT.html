Composite Parts
This year we've designed more than 20 parts, including 2 basic parts. All of the parts are designed ourselves and most of them have been tested to insure their reliability. To see their specific function, you can click here to learn about our project, or browse the specific page on parts.igem.org by clicking on the part numbers.
Basic Parts
This year we've designed two basic parts. BBa_K1960102 is the sRNA which can silence chloramphenicol resistance, synthesized and cloned into pSB1C3 plasmid, and BBa_K1960103 codes formaldehyde dismutase from Halomonas sp. JC-5B, the sequence with BioBrick prefix and suffix is obtained by PCR.

Composite Parts
We've designed a series of composite parts this year, and most of them could be useful tools for constructing other devices or systems. There're also some new devices such as BBa_K1960000 , an exquisite device for diagnosis, and its core subcomponent, BBa_ K1960002 .

Because of the limited time, some of our parts could not been done or tested, but we still submitted most of the well-designed parts to the Registry.
