Overview
XMU-China has done a lot of work in Human Practices this year, such as Newsletter , interviews and brochures . But here, we centered around education and public engagement.
Questionnaires
To collect people’s thoughts about the antibiotics we did some research and summarized the rationale behind the results . We not only asked questions but also talked to the respondents and told them some knowledge about the antibiotics. One of the most important things we've done was to persuade them not to store antibiotics. Self-meditation especially taking antibiotics without prescription is dangerous but ignored by most. After being exhorted by us, the respondents expressed that they would discard the antibiotics stored. Most of them felt regretful about using antibiotics casually and said that they would spread the warning of this unhealthy action to their friends and relatives.
Class
We found that people have paid little attention to antibiotics abuse, so we tried our best to help them comprehend antibiotics. We taught classes of pupils in a primary school and the theme of the lecture is “growing up healthily”. The content of the classes mainly included simple introduction about bacteria, the strong immune system of humans, the emergence of superbug strains and some healthy lifestyles.
During the lecture, we used many vivid examples to make them have a better understanding. And we prepared an interesting short play to expound the abuse of antibiotic. We gave a wonderful performance with the help of some cute props and we recorded a video of the play . The pupils immersed themselves in our performance and learnt many knowledge at the same time.
It was believed that this activity which is success brought pupils knowledge and happiness. We made them know how to live healthier in the future, which was what we wanted to achieve. The team members participated in were inspired by this activity and shared what they thought .
Communication
Communication is an important part in this competition because teams can benefit a lot from others by cooperating. This year, our communications via net-video and face-to-face meeting established a deep friendship with counterparts. We published the idea of reducing antibiotics abuse during all the communications and we hoped that those iGEMers who were talked to could work with us to propagate the proper usage of antibiotics worldwide.
