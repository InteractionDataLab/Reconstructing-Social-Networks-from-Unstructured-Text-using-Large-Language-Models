Experiment 1: Gene Drive
Transform yeast haplotype 1 with our gene drive construct. Mate with yeast wild type haplotype 2. Allow the yeast to sexually reproduce. Once tetrads have formed, pull them apart into the two haplotypes. Look at colony color and sequence yeast colony. If the mating worked, we would expect all colonies to have a red/orange color.
Experiment 2:  Recovery Drive
Transform yeast haplotype 2 with our recovery drive construct. Set up two matings: one with yeast wild type haplotype 1 (A) and the other with yeast haplotype 1 that has the gene drive (B). Allow the yeast to sexually reproduce. Once tetrads have formed, pull them apart into the two haplotypes. Since the orange morphology is a recessive trait, both matings will be repeated to establish genotypic ratios.  It is expected that the genotypic ratio will be 100% for a functional copy of the ADE2 gene.
