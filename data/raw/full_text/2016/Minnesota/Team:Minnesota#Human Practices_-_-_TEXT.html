Building With Biology
Our team had the opportunity to assist the Science Museum of Minnesota and National Informal STEM Education Network (NISE Net) by volunteering at their Building With Biology events in August and September, respectively. This event allows the community to learn about the latest concepts in synthetic biology, as well as have an open discussion of these topics.
We were able to use this opportunity to run activities aimed at teaching people of all ages about biological science and also gauge public opinion on new technologies such as gene drives and genetically modified food.

Gene Drives and Society Video
To understand the concept of gene drives, as well as gauge the opinion of scientists who work in fields related to this advancement, we created a documentary from interviews we had with local researchers.
