Special Thanks
We would like to thank the Gralnick Lab and its personnel for generously allowing us space and equipment to pursue our project. We also extend our gratitude to our advisors, Dr. Aunica Kane, Dr. Casim Sarkar, Dr. Peter Intile, and Dr. Jeff Gralnick. Without whose hard work, support, and expertise our project would never have existed. We would also like to thank our sponsors, whose generous donations enabled our project to be more than an idea.
