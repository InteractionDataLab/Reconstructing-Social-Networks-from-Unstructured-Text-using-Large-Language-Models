During the summer, I gained a vast amount of knowledge on lab research and what it entails. In fact, it has fueled my passion to do research work in future. It’s also a great platform that allows you to focus on activities where you can interact with the public. The outreach section was highly educative as it forced me to push my boundaries and do things I wouldn’t have thought of before like, animating and skydiving. When I am not in the lab or the library, I am often found editing videos or kickboxing.</P></BLOCKQUOTE></DIV></DIV><DIV class="col-md-4"><DIV class="testimonials"><DIV class="active item"><DIV class="carousel-info"><DIV class="pull-left"><SPAN class="testimonials-name">Regina Walsh</SPAN><SPAN class="testimonials-post">3rd Year Biomedical Science Student</SPAN></DIV></DIV></DIV><BLOCKQUOTE><P>I have always had an avid interest in pursuing a career in research.  iGEM was the perfect opportunity to gain first hand experience of what such a career would entail.

I have always enjoyed science as it has given me the freedom to explore the wider world from a molecular level. Having being introduced to synthetic biology a year and a half ago, I was hooked. Not only could I explore life on the molecular level but also modify it from the genetic level with the ultimate goal of providing benefit to man. I enjoy iGEM because it is an all round experience, it is not just lab work for the summer, it is an amalgamation of lab work, public engagement and human practices and therefore unlike anything else! In my spare time, I often go the gym.</P></BLOCKQUOTE></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-md-4"><DIV class="testimonials"><DIV class="active item"><DIV class="carousel-info"><DIV class="pull-left"><SPAN class="testimonials-name">Amy Bergin</SPAN><SPAN class="testimonials-post">3rd Year Genetics Student</SPAN></DIV></DIV></DIV><BLOCKQUOTE><P>iGEM Was my first real taste of research work as it was my first time participating in a research project. iGEM was such a great opportunity and gave me such an insight into what life as a researcher would be like if I choose that as my career path.

I believe that scientific research is one of the few careers in which you have the opportunity to achieve things society has never achieved before, and the ever-expanding field of synthetic biology is the perfect landscape to do so. What’s best about iGEM is that it gives the team the freedom to make the project decisions, and also the opportunity to seek advice from helpful expert advisors. This contributes greatly to the development of both the independent and interdependent skills necessary for modern research. Outside of college and research, I enjoy getting to the gym regularly and watching tv series.</P></BLOCKQUOTE></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-md-4"><DIV class="testimonials"><DIV class="active item"><DIV class="carousel-info"><DIV class="pull-left"><SPAN class="testimonials-name">James Christopher Meeke</SPAN><SPAN class="testimonials-post">3rd Year Medicine Student</SPAN></DIV></DIV></DIV><BLOCKQUOTE><P>I have always loved learning how the world works, and so iGEM sounded like the perfect way to fuel this passion for discovery.

This competition has given me unparalleled access to an all round lab experience which has only encouraged my already huge interest in research. I have been extremely fortunate and I have met a lot of other students who share similar interests, many of whom I am friends with since the Giant Jamboree in 2015! It is incredible to see people coming together from various disciplines to work on a project; it highlights just how inclusive the synthetic biology community is. As a result of my iGEM experiences I am definitely considering a career in research. When I am not in the lab or hiding under a pile of books, you will most likely find me doing Taekwondo or kickboxing, which I have been doing since I was 3!</P></BLOCKQUOTE></DIV></DIV><DIV class="col-md-4"><DIV class="testimonials"><DIV class="active item"><DIV class="carousel-info"><DIV class="pull-left"><SPAN class="testimonials-name">Amy Keane</SPAN><SPAN class="testimonials-post">4th Year Biomedical Science Student</SPAN></DIV></DIV></DIV><BLOCKQUOTE><P>I was first introduced to synthetic biology in lectures in second year, and I was completely captivated by the concept. iGEM has given me incredible opportunities to pursue this interest in synbio and develop my lab skills.

However, as for today, my role is to enjoy the amazing experience of interacting  with such an extraordinary and talented group, from whom I learn constantly!
                  I want to be part of a generation of scientist that together, through an open innovation, create novel and sustainable solutions to current health, social and environmental problems. I believe that synthetic biology gives us the opportunity to do so.I like to be involved and an active participant of initiatives promoting social development, sustainability, education and social justice. I do so by engaging with several charities and societies, for which I am a member, or by raising independent projects,  such as the case of GlowDx, a startup aiming at developing diagnostics for neglected tropical diseases tailored to the needs of developing countries for which I am a co-founder.</P></BLOCKQUOTE></DIV></DIV><DIV class="col-md-4"><DIV class="testimonials"><DIV class="active item"><DIV class="carousel-info"><DIV class="pull-left"><SPAN class="testimonials-name">Dr. Cormac Gahan</SPAN><SPAN class="testimonials-post">Senior Lecturer, UCC</SPAN></DIV></DIV></DIV><BLOCKQUOTE><P>I have a keen interest in using synthetic biology approaches for the development of novel live bacterial vectors for vaccine delivery. In particular my lab has created <I>Lactococcus lactis</I> and <I>Listeria monocytogenes</I> (attenuated) strains with significant potential as vehicles for safe vaccine delivery. Properly designed bacterial vectors can have the ability to stimulate appropriate immune responses through engagement with toll like receptors and to drive antigen presentation via class I and/or class II pathways. Furthermore bacteria can replicate at mucosal sites driving local immunity. It is our goal to use rational synthetic biology approaches to optimise live bacteria as vaccine delivery systems.</P></BLOCKQUOTE></DIV></DIV><DIV class="col-md-4"><DIV class="testimonials"><DIV class="active item"><DIV class="carousel-info"><DIV class="pull-left"><SPAN class="testimonials-name">Dr. Mark Tangney</SPAN><SPAN class="testimonials-post">Principal Investigator, CCRC</SPAN></DIV></DIV></DIV><BLOCKQUOTE><P>Mark is a Principal Investigator within the CCRC where he heads a research team investigating various anticancer gene therapies.
