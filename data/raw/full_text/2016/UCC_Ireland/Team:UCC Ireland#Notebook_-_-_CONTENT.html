On the same gel pIRFP digested with KpnI and HindIII was run, with fragments expected at 3.5kb and 1 kb.</P><P>The gel was run as follows:
                  MSLN colony A1, B1, B2, piRFP colony B1, B2, C1, C2, pNZ44 digested with KpnI and HindIII</P><P>None of the digests were of the expected size; they were all similar to the unligated vector. We decided to abandon these colonies.</P><P>A different approach to the assembly of the dCas9-IKKBsgRNA-pNZ44 construct was suggested and attempted. This consisted of splitting the Gibson Assembly into several steps. The first step assembled Gibson fragment 1 and the digested vector (pNZ44), yielding a product A. The second step assembled Gibson fragment 2 and Gibson fragment 3, yielding a product B. The third step assembled A and B to form the final product. Two approaches to this final assembly were carried out. In the first approach, X, 5uL of both A and B was taken. 10uL of NEB 2x HiFi DNA Assembly Master Mix was added. It was incubated at 50 degrees for 1 hour.
                  In the second approach, 10uL of both A and B were taken. NEB 2x HiFi DNA Assembly Master Mix was not addd. It was incubated at 50 degrees for 1 hour.
               The product was transformed into E.coli C2987I cells. Two different volumes of the ligation products X and Y were added to 50uL cells. 100uL was then plated on two LB agar plates containing chloramphenicol, giving eight plates in total.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="panel panel-default"><DIV class="panel-heading clearfix"><H4 class="panel-title"><A data-toggle="collapse" data-parent="#accordion" href="#collapseNine">Week beginning 8th August</A></H4></DIV><DIV id="collapseNine" class="panel-collapse collapse"><DIV class="panel-body"><P>Sequencing results for LJM11 A3 arrived from MWG. Results were positive, LJM11 now ready to be transformed into L.lactis subsp. cremoris.
                  17 colonies in total were observed from the 8 plates onto which the dCas9-IKKBsgRNA-pNZ44 construct transformation was plated. Colony PCR was carried out to screen for successful colonies. pNZ44 forward primer and dCas9 reverse primer were used. A product of approximately 4500 bp was expected. Results were not as expected:</P><P>Ladder used was NEB 2-log purple ladder:</P><P>Gel 1: Lane 1-10, colonies 1-10 respectively.</P><P>Gel 2: Lane 1-6, colonies 11-17 respectively. Lane 7, positive control, MSP712 amplified using dCas9 forward primer and dCas9 reverse primer. Lane 8, negative control.</P><P>There were no bands of the correct size. Nonetheless, overnight liquid cultures were made of colonies 1, 3, 5, 9, 11, 16. It was reasoned that colony PCR was not a suitable technique for such a large amplicon.</P><P>Plasmid minipreps were made of the overnight liquid cultures. Single digests of these minipreps were carried out using XbaI. The expected size was approximately 8000 bp.</P><P>The gel was run as follows:  pNZ44-dCas9-IKK2 sgRNA colony 1, pNZ44-dCas9-IKK2 sgRNA colony 3, pNZ44-dCas9-IKK2 sgRNA colony 5, pNZ44-dCas9-IKK2 sgRNA colony 9, pNZ44-dCas9-IKK2 sgRNA colony 16, pNZ44 digested with XbaI, undigested pNZ44.</P><P>Colonies 1, 3, 5 and 9 gave the expected size, it was concluded that these colonies were likely correct and sequencing could be carried out.</P><P>Our initial strategy for the replacement of the IKK2 sgRNA with CMV sgRNA was discussed. A G-block containing the CMV sgRNA would be cloned in using standard cloning. Both the pNZ44-dCas9-IKK2 sgRNA and the CMV G-block would be digested with XbaI and SmaI. The pNZ44-dCas9-IKK2 sgRNA would be run on a gel and the top band removed using gel extraction and subsequently purified. It would then be dephosphorylated using Antarctic phosphatase. These would then be ligated using T4 DNA ligase.</P><P>However, we reasoned that this method would be difficult. It might not be possible to see if our double digest was successful - when run on a gel, as it would look the same as a single cut plasmid. This was because the dropout would be very small (approximately 200bp) compared to the original plasmid (approximately 8000 bp).</P><P>A meeting with our supervisors and our secondary investigator took place. A new method of assembly of the pNZ44-dCas9-IKK2 sgRNA construct was designed. A new Gibson fragment 3 was ordered, which contained sgRNA against the CMV promoter instead of against the IKK2 promoter. This would be cloned using the same Gibson assembly method which worked for the  pNZ44-dCas9-IKK2 sgRNA construct. This G-block was ordered from IDT.</P><P>A new method of assembling our pNZ44-piRFP construct was also designed. This method would require the assembly of one insert into the vector, instead of the assembly of three inserts into the vector, which was previously attempted. Planning for the next parts of the project was carried out, including protein work and cell culture work.</P><P>Glycerol stocks of the successful pNZ44-USP45-His-LJM11 construct were made.</P><P>https://www.addgene.org/plasmid-protocols/create-glycerol-stock/</P></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="panel panel-default"><DIV class="panel-heading clearfix"><H4 class="panel-title"><A data-toggle="collapse" data-parent="#accordion" href="#collapseTen">Week beginning 15th August</A></H4></DIV><DIV id="collapseTen" class="panel-collapse collapse"><DIV class="panel-body"><P>GM17 broth and agar plates were made (find manufacturer of M17 for reference.
