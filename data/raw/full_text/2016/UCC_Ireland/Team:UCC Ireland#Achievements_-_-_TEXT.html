Bronze Medal Achievements
Registered for, attended and presented at iGEM 2016.
Completed all deliverables in section 3 of Requirements page.
Work attributed as necessary on wiki.
Documented at least one new standard BioBrick Part or Device central to our project and submitted this part to the iGEM Registry.
Silver Medal Achievements
Validated part: Experimentally validated that at least one new BioBrick Part or Device of our own design and construction works as expected. Documented the characterization of this part in the Main Page section of that Part’s/Device’s Registry entry. Submitted this new part to the iGEM Parts Registry.
Collaboration - helped any registered iGEM team from high school, a different track, another university, or another institution in a significant way. Click here for our collaborations page.
Human Practices - iGEM projects involve important questions beyond the lab bench, for example relating to (but not limited to) ethics, sustainability, social justice, safety, security, and intellectual property rights. Demonstrated how our team has identified, investigated, and addressed one or more of these issues in the context of your project.
Gold Medal Achievements
Integrated Human Practices - Expanded on our silver medal activity by demonstrating how we have integrated the investigated issues into the design and/or execution of our project
Proof of concept - Demonstrated a functional proof of concept of our project. Using our iRFP construct, we were able to validate the fact that the iRFP protein only fluoresces in the presence of the cofactor billiverdin, a cofactor which is present in mammalian cells and not bacterial cells. We showed that there is a linear relationship between the number of bacterial cells expressing iRFP and the intensity of fluorescence, in the presence of Foetal Bovine Serum (FBS), a component of cell culture medium which contains billiverdin.
Demonstrate your work - Show your project working under real-world conditions. To achieve this criterion, you should demonstrate your whole system, or a functional proof of concept working under simulated conditions in the lab (biological materials may not be taken outside the lab).The function of our protein producing platform is to deliver proteins of interest to antigen-presenting cells for a number of different applications, e.g. vaccination. Using our iRFP construct, we were able to demonstrate the ability of our L.lactis subsp. cremoris strain to deliver a protein of interest to the cytosol of macrophages.
