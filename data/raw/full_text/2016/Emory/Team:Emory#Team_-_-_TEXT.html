A brief description.
Student Jasmine is a rising senior at Emory University majoring in Chemistry and International Studies. After graduating, she intends on pursuing a doctoral degree and would like to do research in medicine or public health. When she's not in the lab, you can find her playing tennis or reading a book!
Student Cyrillus is a junior student at Emory College majoring in biology and computer science. While his research interest is to reform the personalized medicine with information technology, he is also a student of international economics concerning with modern business model. He intends to pursue a doctoral degree in biomedical informatics after graduation.
Student
Talia is a senior at Emory University pursuing a double major in Neuroscience and Creative Writing. Following graduation, she is eager to begin her MD/PhD dual degree program and from there, would like to go on to do translational research in neuropharmacology. links.
Student Sujith is a sophomore at Emory University, majoring in Neuroscience and Psychology. Currently, he is researching the virulence of both S. aureus and S. pneumoniae. Outside of lab, he loves to play his guitar and piano. Every once in a while, he also likes to capture a Pidgey or two./span>
Student Kathy is a sophomore at Emory University, majoring in Biology and Violin Performance. While at Emory, she works in Dr. Jin-Tang Dong's lab at Winship Cancer Institute learning lab practices and assisting Emory graduate students in their research.Outside of the lab, she focuses more of her time on music, video games, and the occasional inspired workout.
Student Mone is a sophomore student at Emory College studying biology and psychology. She currently works at an HIV lab Yerkes national primate research center, but hopes to pursue research in psychiatric disorders in the future.
