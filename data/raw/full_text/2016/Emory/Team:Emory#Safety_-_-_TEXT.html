Our Concerns
The iGEM team at Emory took every necessary precaution to ensure the safety during laboratory procedures for all our team members. We cultured E. Coli and Acinetobacter baylyi ADP1 in small volumes, no more than 1L at a time. These organisms are from Risk Group 1 and will never leave the lab environment.
