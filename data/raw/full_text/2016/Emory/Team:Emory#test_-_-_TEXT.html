Our Wiki page is organized in a comprehensive, linear manner so that every user can navigate it easily. Want to skip ahead a few sections?  Have a go at the navigation bar and it'll push you in the right direction. If you ever get lost, you can always use it to return to our core pages, including the more detailed map below. I don't know what I just typed, I just needed to see what the text looks like. All of this will be edited further later.
WHAT ARE WE DOING HERE?
Synthetic Biology is largely restricted to well-funded laboratories at major research universities in high income countries. One significant barrier to entry is the capital cost of instruments. The cloning and assembly of BioBricks, for example, includes the transformation of Escherichia coli, which requires the purchase of a refrigerated centrifuge and an ultra-cold freezer. Here we assemble BioBrick-compatible shuttle vectors for Acinetobacter baylyi ADP1, a naturally competent relative of E. coli that grows as rapidly under identical conditions. We will show that A. baylyi can be transformed with recombinant DNA simply by adding ligation reactions to mid-log cultures; transformants are selected as usual by spreading them onto LB agar plates supplemented with the appropriate antibiotics (kanamycin, spectinomycin, tetracycline, cefotaxime or amikacin). These experiments will show how BioBricks can be constructed and assembled in modestly funded laboratories in community colleges, high schools and even private homes. The resulting plasmid constructs retain their pSB1C3 backbones and will thus remain compatible with the BioBrick standard and capable of replication in the widely used E. coli chassis.

ATTRIBUTIONS
We've come a long way and it's time to give credit where it's due.
Building and Establishing Our Team
Emory Biotech was created by Rohita and Josh (and other people whose names I will need). We'll add a few more lines to give proper thanks to these individuals for taking the time to establish a base from which this group could flourish (funding from department, legitimizing the club..etc). Note: Most of the text in these sections are just to show what attributions will look like. I will definitely add more categories to make sure all aspects of this project ae covered and people get due credit
Experimental Design and Conduct
Some student(s) was responsible for this and this and that and that. Someone came up with the experimental design and other things with the help of Dr. Matsumura...etc.
General Lab Support/Challenging Technique
Dr. Matsumura generously provided his lab space and plenty of his time in teaching our researchers important lab techniques....etc.
KickStarter Campaign Management
Maruf did many things etc etc etc.
Human Practices and Outreach Coordinator
Someone did many things to make this possible etc etc etc.
Lead Wiki and Graphic Designer
The wiki was designed, supervised, and maintained by Talia. Logos were done by...etc.
General Support, Project support and advice, Fundraising help and advice, Lab support, Difficult technique support, Project advisor support, Wiki support, Presentation coaching, Human Practices support, Thanks and acknowledgements for all other people involved in helping make a successful iGEM team.
JUDGING AND EVALUATIONS
For the convenience of the judges, we've gathered all the links to the specific pages we'd like to be evaluated for and put them in one spot.
