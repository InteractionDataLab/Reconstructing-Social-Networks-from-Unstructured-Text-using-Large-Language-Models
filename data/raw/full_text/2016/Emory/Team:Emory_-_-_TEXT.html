As a whole, iGEMORY and the Emory Biotech Club is a new group that was created in 2015 but began to take off in 2016. Our history really begins with GSUâ€™s participation in the 2015 Jamboree, as two of our members collaborated with GSU on Project J-Broth and accompanied their team to the jamboree (at this time Emory did not have a team and did not compete). Inspired by the entirety of the iGEM experience, our two members returned home with plenty of ideas and excitement, and moved forward to establish iGEMory and take us to our first competition. This brings us to where we stand now.
