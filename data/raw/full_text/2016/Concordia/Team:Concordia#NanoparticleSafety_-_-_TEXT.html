Team:Concordia/NanoparticleSafety
Human Practices
Nanoparticle Safety
Team Concordia is dedicated to ensuring that every member of the team is aware of how to safely handle nanomaterials. Each member has attended several biosafety courses offered by our university's Environmental Health and Safety (EHS) department. We have also collaborated with EHS to create a Standard Operatiing Procedure (SOP) with detailed instructions on how to safely work with nanoparticles. The SOP is divided into sections for each part of our project and provides information on all the reagents and microorganisms we will be using. This SOP will be uploaded to our wiki soon. Our hope is that it will help other iGEM teams who wish to work with nanoparticles now or in the future.
