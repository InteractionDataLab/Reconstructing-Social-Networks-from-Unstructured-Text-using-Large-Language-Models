Episode 1: Project Overview
The first video in our webseries is an introduction to our project. It provides an overview of the different phases of the project, including nanoparticle synthesis, nanoparticle attachment to cell surfaces and the cell battle on a microfluidics chip. Details on each of these phases will be provided in later episodes of the webseries.
Episode 2: Student Interviews
In order to get inspiration, we turned to the student community in Concordia University. We interviewed several people on their thoughts about nanoparticles and how they could be used as nano-weapons.
Episode 3: Nanoparticle Safety
This episode of our webseries compliments our Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) and our essay on the effects of nanoparticles on the environment. It contains information about proper lab safety. For more information no nanoparticles, follow this link to our essay

Episode 4: Chemical Synthesis of Nanoparticles
In Episode 4 of our webseries, Team iGEM Concordia explains the chemical methods of nanoparticle synthesis being used in this project. The two methods are the Martin method and the Turkevich method. The Martin method is being used to create gold nanoparticles ranging in size from 1-10nm. The Turkevich method is allowing us to create silver nanoparticles ranging in size from 15-30nm.
Episode 5: Plant Synthesis of Nanoparticles
In an effort to substitute certain chemicals for more eco-friendly alternatives, iGEM Concordia researched plant based methods of nanoparticle synthesis. In our project, we use three different plants to create nanoparticles. Garlic extract is used to create gold nanoparticles ranging in size from 1-10nm, these nanoparticles resemble those synthesized through the Martin method. Cabbage extract can be used to create silver nanoparticles ranging in size from 15-30nm. To switch things up, we used aloe vera extract to synthesize gold nanoparticles of various shapes and sizes.
Episode 6: Nanoparticle Attachment to Cells
Following synthesis of our nanoparticles, we attach these nanoparticles to the surface of cells. Gold nanoparticles synthesized through the Martin and Garlic methods can be used to create a gold nanoshell around the surface of S. cerevisiae cells. This gold nanoshell serves as a form of defense for our yeast cells during the cell battle. Silver nanoparticles synthesized through the Turkevich and Cabbage methods can be used for our "cyborg" method of attachment. This method can be used to attach silver nanoparticles to both S. cerevisiae and E.coli cells after coating the nanoparticles with Poly(allylamine hydrochloride).
