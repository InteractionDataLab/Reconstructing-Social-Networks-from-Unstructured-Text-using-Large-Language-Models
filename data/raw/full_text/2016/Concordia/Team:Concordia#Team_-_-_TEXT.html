Meet the Contestants for this year's competition!!!
Alexandra Teggin:
She recently graduated from Concordia University with a Specialization in Cell and Molecular Biology. She became interested in participating in iGEM after performing her independent research project involved with protein trafficking, and wishes to pursue her studies in psychopharmacology.
Kevin Gorjipour:
A second year undergraduate student in honors in Cell and Molecular Biology. He loves to study many different topics of science and hopes to pursue the interdisciplinary field of study of biomedical engineering.
Jason Desranleau:
A recent graduate from Concordia University with a degree in Honours Biochemistry, he wants to pursue future studies in veterinary medicine. In his free time, he likes gaming, jogging, and baking.
Maria Salouros:
A first-year undergraduate student specializing in Biology at Concordia University. She’s also a competitor for Concordia’s tennis team and volunteers at the Montreal Children’s Hospital weekly. Eager to gain research experience and work hands-on in synthetic biology.
Alaa Selim:
A second year undergraduate student in Biology with a double minor in political science and film studies. Alaa has many interests and hobbies: comedy, experimental film, and street art. She wishes to pursue a degree in whatever destiny has determined for her, which is code for “I dont know...yet.”
Julia Phillipp:
A graduating Concordia University student who is completing her undergraduate degree in Honours Cell and Molecular Biology with a minor in Interdisciplinary Studies in Science. She is actively involved in cell cycle research and is interested in pursuing her studies in the health sciences.
Thiban Navaratrarajah:
He is in his final year in his specialization in Molecular Biology at Concordia University. When asked about his plans for the future, Thiban has learned to mask the “I don’t know... yet” statement, with “So many possibilities!”
Edgar Daniel Fuller Altamirano:
A mexican from BC who’s currently a third year undergraduate student in Speciliazation in Cell and Molecular Biology Extended Credit Program and he wants to pursue medicine. He currently enjoys napping and the colour purple… quite grumpy when he doesn’t nap.
Nathalie Jreidini:
She is entering her third year at Concordia University majoring in Biology and minoring in Environmental Geography. She opts for a career as a conservation biologist, but has yet to explore other diverse fields in synthetic biology through iGEM.
Farhat Zafar:
She has one year left until she graduates with a specialization in Biology. She finds the field of genetics particularly interesting. The first time she heard about iGEM was when she was a first year student and she immediately knew that she would participate in this competition one day.
