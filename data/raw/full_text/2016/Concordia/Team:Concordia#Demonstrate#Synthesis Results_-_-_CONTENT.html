We had initially expected the nanoparticles to be triangular in shape and to be around 100 nm in size. Upon inspection, we found that the nanoparticles were a variety of sizes from 10 to 100 nm and were not exclusively triangular. We also found that there was a film around the nanoparticles, which we learned was potentially organics from our extracts. 
</FIGCAPTION></DIV><DIV class="results"><FIGCAPTION class="resdesc"><STRONG>EDS Results:</STRONG>
An Energy-dispersive X-ray spectrogram (EDS) was obtained for our samples to confirm that they were indeed gold. High peaks for copper and carbon are a result of the grid used in the microscope. The peaks containing gold (Au) are a confirmation that the nanoparticles are made of gold.

A maximum absorbance at approximately 530 nm confirms the presence of gold nanoparticles, which was most strongly displayed by nanoparticles that were synthesized using an aloe vera extract that was 40%(v/v) in solution. This result further confirms the presence of gold nanoparticles.

The expected triangular shapes were observed in some of the synthesized nanoparticles but not all of them and the size ranges was far from the 100 nm that were expected. The drop-rate of the chloroauric acid into the aloe vera extract can be controled more efficiently and perhaps this would yield better results. After testing different concentrations of chloroauric acid and different aloe vera to chloroauric acid ratios we found that the optimal parameters for the synthesis of these gold nanoparticles is 1 mM chloroauric acid with 40% (v/v) Aloe Vera extract.

The TEM images of the gold nanoparticles indicate that the nanoparticles are in fact spherical and that their average size is 4.5 nm (ranging between 2-8 nm) as expected.

After having tested multiple variables, those that yielded the relatively best results were samples that contained 0.25mM HAuCl4 mixed with a basic 1%(v/v) garlic extract. They were the quickest to undergo a colour transformation (i.e to synthesize). Furthermore, according to our TEM photos, they were also the most stable to produce as there was no aggregation or agglomeration that formed and the majority of the nanoparticles formed were nearly uniformly shaped and sized. Thus, the concentration of chloroauric acid versus plant extract concentration has been optimized.

According to the protocol we followed from published literature, we expected our silver nanoparticles from cabbage extract to be within 30-50nm in size and spherical.

Individual nanoparticles cannot be observed through a typical light microscope because of their small size.  Once synthesis of our nanoparticles was complete, we brought samples to a Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM) to observe our nanoparticles. Above is one of the images from the TEM. The nanoparticles were all spherical in size and fell into our expected range of 1 - 10nm. Most of the nanoparticles were around 5 nm in size, which is optimal for our nanoshell attachment method.

One method for determining the size of nanoparticles involves the use of dynamic light scattering (DLS). This method measures the size of nanoparticles based on the water molecules surrounding the nanoparticles. This hydrodynamic size confirms the diameter of our nanoparticles. According to our DLS data, most of the nanoparticles synthesized through the Martin Method were 3nm or 5nm. This falls into our expected range of 1-10nm.

The Martin method was very simple to perform and gave very consistent results. The colour change to red in the solution indicated the presence of gold nanoparticles which were later confirmed and characterized with TEM imaging and DLS. UV-vis analysis detected a peak at around 511 nm which is within the range indicated in the literature confirming the presence of gold nanoparticles.

In conclusion, our best results were generated when mixing 883 microM of silver nitrate and 1% (m/v) sodium citrate together. The majority of the nanoparticles generated under these conditions were consistent in shape and size. They were also the most relatively stable samples to be produced, as only minor aggregates and agglomerates were detected. Overall, they are in good condition to be used for attachment to cells.
