The iGEM Concordia 2016 team has considered Education and Public Engagement to be a priority for this yearâ€™s project. One of the main initiatives was writing a SOP which includes safety and experiment protocols. It was made public on our website so that scientists working with nanoparticles could use it as a reference during their work. We also conducted presentations at Pierrefonds High School Biology classes to introduce our project as well as the iGEM competition, and another interactive presentation for the Concordia Athletics Summer Camp kids by performing three science experiments. Furthermore, we shared a webseries which depicts what goes on in the lab during our experiments and explains some of the science behind our project through animations and videos. Finally, we conducted a series of interviews with Concordia University students through which we informed them about the pros and cons of nanoparticles as well as their daily uses.
