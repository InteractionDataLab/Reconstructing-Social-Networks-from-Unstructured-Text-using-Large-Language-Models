Chemical Synthesis: Turkevich Method
*The safety information in the table above is based on the SDS for each chemical.
1. Sigma-Aldrich Corporation. SDS: Silver Nitrate.
2. Sigma-Aldrich Corporation. SDS: Trisodium Citrate Dihydrate.
 
Used to synthesize silver nanoparticles ranging from 15-30nm.
 
Protocol:
1. Fill a 50 mL falcon tube with ddH2O.
 
2. Weigh out 3.6 mg (0.0036 g) of AgNO3 powder.
Light sensitive - limit light exposure by covering with aluminum foil
 
3. Measure 20 mL of ddH2O in a 25 mL graduated cylinder. Pour the water into a 100 mL beaker.
 
4. Add the AgNO3 solid to the ddH2O in the beaker and place a stir bar into the solution to mix it.
 
5. On the hot plate, stir the solution with the stir bar and boil it to fully dissolve the AgNO3. Place a watch glass on the opening of the beaker to prevent vapours from escaping during boiling.
-Light sensitive - limit light exposure by covering with aluminum foil
-During this step, nanoparticle synthesis should occur
 
6. Measure 4 mL of 1% sodium citrate into a 10 mL graduated cylinder.
-If the 1% sodium citrate solution is not prepared, 5 mL of sodium citrate solution can be made:
A) Weigh out 0.05 g (50 mg) of sodium citrate solid.
B) Using a 10 mL graduated cylinder, measure 5 mL of ddH2O and pour it into a conical tube.
C) Add the sodium citrate to the conical tube and cap the tube.
 
7. Mix the solution by inversion until the solid dissolves.
 
8. Add the sodium citrate to the AgNO3 solution dropwise into the beaker with continuous stirring.  
-Keep stirring until a yellow-brown color change is observed, at about 10 min - indicating citrate attachment to Ag nanoparticles
 
9. Remove the solution of citrate-coated nanoparticles from the hot plate and let it cool down at room temperature.
 
10. Store in 4°C fridge.
