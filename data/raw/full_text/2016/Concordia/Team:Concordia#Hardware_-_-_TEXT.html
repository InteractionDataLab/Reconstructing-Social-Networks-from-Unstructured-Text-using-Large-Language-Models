Hardware is at the core of our project. We have developed easy-to-fabricate, droplet microfluidic devices for single cell isolation and examination. Droplets containing the single cells can be either examined individually or re-merged into a dual-cell system. While we designed the system as our microfluidic "battledome", the system can flexibly be used to characterize other single cell-cell or cell-environment interactions. Measurements with the device may be taken directly by image analysis, absorbance, or fluorescence measurements. We have demonstrated clear droplet formation with our system, along with fluorescent detection. Our droplet microfluidic platform for flexible single-cell measurements has the capacity to be used for biological analysis far beyond the scope of our MicroGladiator project. Microfluidics Results
