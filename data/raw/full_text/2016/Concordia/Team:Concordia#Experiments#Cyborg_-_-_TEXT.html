Cyborg Method of Nanoparticle Attachment Protocol
Protocol for attaching silver nanoparticles to E.coli:
1. Add 2mL of citrate-capped silver nanoparticles to 10mL of aqueous polyelectrolyte solution (1% PAH)
 
2. Sonicate for 20 min using the jewelry sonicator set to “high”
 
3. The nanoparticle solution needs to be stirred for 24h
 
4. Centrifuge the solution at high (12000rpm) for 2 min
 
5. Wash 3 times with water
 
6. Mix 100 μL of E.coli (3.0*107 cells/mL) or yeast cells (2.5*109 cells/mL) with 1mL of 0.45 mg/mL PE-stabilised silver nanoparticles
 
7. Incubate for 15 min in a low speed shaker
 
8. Centrifuge at high 2min to separate cells from loose nanoparticles
 
9. Wash cells with water
