Our Project
Antibiotics are a hallmark of modern medicine having        saved numerous lives since the discovery of penicillin in        1928. Bacteria resistant to antibiotics emerged shortly        after their initial use, and is an increasing problem as pathogenic strains of bacteria evolve resistance to        multiple drugs. In an effort to increase antibiotic        susceptibility, we will use CRISPR/Cas9 technologies        to disrupt intrinsic resistance mechanisms in E. coli.        Specifically, we plan to enhance the expression of        Omp pores while also inhibiting the functioning of        AcrAB-TolC efflux pumps. Mechanism for effective        delivery of a functioning CRISPR system in clinical        settings will be explored.
Our Team
Nithin Saripalli is high school senior who is passionate in science and technology. This is his second year competing in iGEM and looks forward to the new experiences he will gain this year. In addition to iGEM, Nithin is a passionate member of the FRC 2410 robotics team, the CAPS cyberpatriot team, the Emerald Regiment Marching Band, and the Olathe Youth Symphony. He currently has limited his career to somewhere within biology and technology with an emphasis on artificial intelligence. Nithin’s favorite hobby is to go outside and photograph and film nature.

Safety
While CAPS Kansas has certainly dedicated itself to the frontier of microbiology research and exploration, safety is still the top priority. CAPS Kansas has followed proper safety guidelines for all labs and experiments. Non-pathogenic strains of Escherichia coli were the subjects of all experiments. All tools were properly sanitized and disposed of after use. Hazardous chemicals were handled with full diligence and care under the watchful supervision of lab experts Mr. Kessler and Mr. Whalen. CAPS Kansas takes safety seriously. We encourage all iGEM teams to follow proper safety guidelines, and to never under any circumstances forsake human safety for fast results.
Human Practices
CAPS Kansas believes that proper, engaging STEM education begins much earlier than high school. By combing pop culture with fun science, CAPS Kansas hopes to inspire and cultivate young scientists.
