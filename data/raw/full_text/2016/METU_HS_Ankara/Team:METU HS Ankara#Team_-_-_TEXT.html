ABOUT THE TEAM
People in our school became aware of the iGEM competition after a school club                     was made under the name “iGEM”. After two years of its establishment and its                     success in the iGEM competition last year, students learned what this club was all                     about and they became interested in it. Hence lots of students gathered in this                     club.
Our team, METU HS iGEM consists of students from different age groups                     and with a variety of personalities. And our diversity is what makes this team so                     vibrant and full of color. But as well as our differences, we also have our                     similarities; we all like biology and creativity. Most of us wanted to join this team                     to obtain an experience in a worldwide famous competition like iGEM, because                     most of us are planning to study biology in the future.
Just like any other team in iGEM, we had our ups and downs during our times of                     work. But eventually we learned that nothing can be achieved without working                     hard and as the time passed we learned to work in union. We accepted our                     differences and became like brothers and sisters with each other. We had quite                     hard time determining our project idea but as we worked harder and researched                     more, we found our most suitable project idea. We love going to the lab and put                     some music on and sing and have fun as we work. We especially love treating                     bacteria that we’ve cloned as our sons and daughters. We had so much fun doing                     our human practices and helped the society to raise awareness about colon                     cancer.
As a team, we think that iGEM is surely more than a synthetic biology                     competition because it provided us to think creatively and improve our problem                     solving skills. We are all glad that we joined the iGEM family and grateful that we met                     each other within this team.

Hi there, I am Tugba Inanc Gok. I am a Biology teacher at  METU High School and primary instructor of METU HS iGEM team. As an educator I am volunteer to any kind of scientific project that gives my students the opportunity to be scientist of future. In that manner doing iGEM in high school is the best opportunity for me and for my students. All iGEM steps and processes require hard working but nothing makes me happier than seeing how fun synthetic biology is and makes students enthusiastic in the field of area. I was always interested in synthetic biology and genetic engineering, but the best part is to explore this world with my students. This is officially my second year at iGEM, me and my team put best effort for our project and are very excited to be part of iGEM family.

Hey! I’m Cem, A.K.A. Matlab Veteran, and I’m 11th grade student in METU High School. Biology as a whole is very enticing to me so it came as no surprise that it didn’t take long to make me like the concept of molecular biology and iGEM. I just love how a group of students gather under the name of iGEM, sit down and try and find answers to serious problems. All in all, I’m very glad to be an iGEMmer and hope our results will be satisfying.

Heyy I am Burak, I am a master student at Biological Science Department in Middle East Technical University. After two years with iGEM as a team member, finally I can participate as an advisor and welcome new iGEMmers. Introducing people to science, directing their attention to synthetic biology and seeing their passions are the most attractive sides of iGEM. We got used to iGEM summer works, all its tiredness and distress. Then the project presentation comes closer and experiments are over, all effort is worth the distress. iGEM also becomes full of scientific pleasure. Enjoy doing science!

Hi everyone, I’m Ece Berenis Demir a.k.a Professional Polyp! I’m 16 years old. I’m a 11th grade student and it’s my first year in METU High School Ankara iGEM Team. I’m really into biology and genetics so I think iGEM is a wonderful opportunity to experience the atmosphere of the lab and do what I love. Since iGEM is worldwide competition it also will have great impact on my future as genetics is the discipline that I want to work on when I graduate. Also in iGEM we try to solve the problems in the world such as cancer and I think this is something really important for the future because when we grow up, we’ll know that small things can have big effects on the biggest problems.
