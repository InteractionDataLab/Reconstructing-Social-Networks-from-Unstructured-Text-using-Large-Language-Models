As it is the most lethal disease, we preferred to study cancer. We read numerous articles about cancer types and treatments. After so many research we decided to work on colon cancer because it is one of the most common cancer type in the world and also it is directly related to alimentation and exercising. As nowadays people tend to move less, can’t find time to exercise daily and the diet of most people consists processed food, we thought that we can enlighten people about eating healthy and exercising regularly. It was a great opportunity for us to go beyond the lab.</P></SECTION><SECTION class="item col-xs-12 all category2"><H3>Christmas Tree</H3><P>At the beginning of our journey, we started by informing our school about iGEM and genetic engineering. To introduce iGEM, we built a Christmas tree with laboratory gloves and decorated it with scientific ornaments.  It may seem easy however it took a lot of time and teamwork to built. We enjoyed every second of it as we got to know each other. As it was our first team work, we learned how to act like a team and share duties. It left a huge impact on the students and also on science teachers. We were so pleased because we got the attention we wanted.</P></SECTION><SECTION class="item col-xs-12 all category3"><H3>School Canteen Ban &amp; Bake Sale</H3><P>As healthy eating plays a huge role in the prevention of cancer, we decided to do more activities regarding diet and exercise.</P><P>We talked with our school canteen, ask them to ban the sales of chocolate. After numerous meetings, we were able to remove the chocolate sale. Moreover, we organized a bake sale which we have sold foods that contain some pastries but generally dietary fiber mostly fruits &amp; whole grains. Bake sales are common in our school however most of them usually sell junk food and processed food.</P><P>By our bake sale we raised awareness of our friends and teachers about healthy eating and prevention of colon cancer by alimentation. We figured out that the bake sale that we’ve done is the first bake sale that includes healthy nutrition.</P><P>We also handed them out brochures about do’s and don’ts when it comes to healthy eating. In addition, we donated our income to “Dance with Cancer Association” which is a foundation that educates people about cancer, creates awareness and encourages cancer prevention and early detection for all types of cancer. It was a great experience to work with such a big association.</P></SECTION><SECTION class="item col-xs-12 all category4"><H3>Attending a Conference At Medicana Hospital / TURKEY</H3><P>The colon cancer runs that we’ve organized heard by “Medicana Hospital” and they sent an invitation letter to attend their “Colon Cancer and Treatment” conference. As the whole team, we joined their conference and listened to honorable professors whose main areas of research interest are cancers. They shared their wide knowledge. We also got to chance to speak them privately after the conference, to introduce our project to them. They gave a chance for us to question our pathway and offered help and consultation. When we explained our ideas and pathway, firstly they congratulated us for being so aware of health problems at such young age. After the conference which is a huge opportunity for us to gain knowledge, we took a look at the posters about cancer and the huge colon model which are brought by “Dance with Cancer Association”</P><P>We talked with that association and asked for permission to bring the giant colon model to our school. By that way, we could give information about colon flora, colon cancer stages and early detection for cancer.</P></SECTION><SECTION class="item col-xs-12 all category5"><H3>Reflection</H3><P>iGEM contributed so many values and skills to us especially human practices. We learn how to work as a team, participate in events and collaborate with organisations. We wanted to keep our human practices adaptable for every age and educational background. We are so honored to inform people about synthetic biology and introduce them our project. One of the most valuable parts of our human practices was to increase awareness of people. We enjoyed every second of these great experiences. Thank you so much!</P></SECTION></SECTION></SECTION></DIV></DIV></SECTION></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
