As it is a very lethal disease, we preferred to study cancer. We read numerous articles about cancer types and treatments. After so many research we decided to work on colon cancer because it is one of the most common cancer types in the world and also it is directly related to alimentation and exercising. As nowadays people tend to move less, can’t find time to exercise daily and the diet of most people consists processed food, we thought that we can enlighten people about eating healthy and exercising regularly. It was a great opportunity for us to go beyond the lab.</P></SECTION><SECTION class="item col-xs-12 all category2"><H3>Presentation at Acıbadem University</H3><P>Because of our successes in the iGEM competition last year, our primary instructor Tuğba İnanç Gök was invited to give a presentation on the team’s IGEM experience to many different students from many different schools. She discussed what the competition is all about, and if it is possible to work on synthetic biology in high school. Her presentation was viewed by many and was put on YouTube to be viewed by a larger audience.</P></SECTION><SECTION class="item col-xs-12 all category3"><H3>Newspaper</H3><P>As the first high school team to get rewarded with Best Part Collection and Best New Composite Part at the iGEM competition from Turkey, we appeared on the prominent newspapers such as, Sabah, Hürriyet and Yeniyüzyıl. By that way, we were able to inform more people about iGEM.</P></SECTION><SECTION class="item col-xs-12 all category4"><H3>School Magazine</H3><P>Because of our successful results in the last year’s competition we were given a special part in the school magazine “Devinim” which allowed us to teach people about iGEM and our team. We had a whole page in the magazine which allowed us to explain what iGEM is, what we do, what synthetic biology is and how we used it.</P></SECTION><SECTION class="item col-xs-12 all category5"><H3>iGEM Christmas Tree</H3><P>In the beginning of the year we built a christmas tree out of lab gloves and decorated it with scientific ornaments. The tree was liked by both students and teachers and we managed to promote iGEM in our schools. Also, it was one of the first times we spent time together as a team. So, while working on it we got to know each other better.</P></SECTION><SECTION class="item col-xs-12 all category6"><H3>DNA Day</H3><P>In order to teach DNA base pairs and introduce iGEM to middle school students, we decided to celebrate DNA Day with them.  For that day we designed a matching game about matching the DNA bases fastly and accurately.  At the end of the day, we gave the students prizes and handed out cards containing information and funny facts about iGEM. We printed out posters and brochures about genetic engineering and iGEM and handed them out as well. These activitites resulted in an improvement in students’ learning, recognition of iGEM in our school, and an overall fun day.</P><P>On DNA day, we did some activities with middle-school students. We decorated their entrance with ballons and posters about DNA to attract their attention. Furthermore we designed a little DNA base pair matching game. We made base pairs out of papers and told the students to match A with T, and G with C. It was a very simple and fun activity. We realized that, although DNA base pairs are taught at school, few students actually understood them. With this activity, we enhanced the students’ learning and made them more interested in biology. Also, seeing students younger than us reminded us of  ourselves when we were their age. We wished that someone did this type of activities to us then. That would have increased our interest in biology.</P></SECTION><SECTION class="item col-xs-12 all category7"><H3>Colon Cancer Conference</H3><P>We were invited to a colon cancer conference in Medicana Hospital. This conference was about colon cancer and treatments. As a team we joined their conference and listened to colon cancer patients, honorable professors, especially Prof. Dr. Şuayib Yalçın. After the conference, we introduced our project to him and asked for advice. He shared his wide knowledge and gave a chance for us to question our pathway. He offered us help and consultation. When we explained our ideas and pathway, firstly he congratulated us for being so aware of health problems at such a young age.</P></SECTION><SECTION class="item col-xs-12 all category8"><H3>Survey</H3><P>We prepared a survey to learn about people’s eating and exercise habits. The results were as expected but not in a good way. We found out that many people don’t have a healthy diet and don’t exercise regularly. Furthermore, we realized there was a correlation between exercise and alimentation to colon cancer. Our survey also questions the knowledge about synthetic biology.</P><P>Results can be found in the following link:</P></SECTION><SECTION class="item col-xs-12 all category9"><H3>Giant colon model in the school and inviting pre-school and primary school students</H3><P>To teach pre-school, primary and high school students about the importance of eating healthy and exercising regularly we brought a giant colon model to our school. The children were very interested in our model. They were all very eager to touch and learn more about it. As always, the hands on learning is the best type of learning and those kids learned a lot that day. We were able to show them directly what happens when they don’t eat healthy and exercise regularly. They were impressed by our model and were more inclined to finish their vegetables that day. We know that, many children at that age would rather eat chocolate and candy than vegetables and fruits, so it is very important to teach them the ramifications of junk food early on. By that way, they can avoid the twenty first century problems like obesity and cancer.</P></SECTION><SECTION class="item col-xs-12 all category10"><H3>Run for colon cancer</H3><P>To increase the awareness of colon cancer and exercising we organized a running activity in Lake Eymir, a lake that is located near to our city, Ankara. People from all around Ankara participated in our activity. Everyone wore blue because it is the color for colon cancer. That day people from different backgrounds, different ideas, different status were united for a common cause. All the participants had fun that day so we decided to make it a regular occurence.</P></SECTION><SECTION class="item col-xs-12 all category11"><H3>Discussion Sessions with Assoc. Prof. Sreeparna Banerji</H3><P>After reviewing literature on colon cancer, we asked Sreeparna Banerjee for her advice, since she works on effects of Butyrate inhibition on colon cancer for many years. We discussed our project with her regularly and got chance to shape our project according to her feedbacks. We have centered Butyrate in our project treatment and further research were carried on after these discussions.</P></SECTION><SECTION class="item col-xs-12 all category12"><H3>Bakesale</H3><P>To increase the awareness of eating healthy we did a bakesale in our school. We sold fresh fruits and vegetables and donated our income to Dance with Cancer Association. Most of the bakesales in our school sell unhealthy sugary and greasy foods, so our bakesale drew a lot of attention.</P></SECTION><SECTION class="item col-xs-12 all category13"><H3>Ban of Selling Chocolate and Other Unhealthy Foods in our School Canteen</H3><P>As avoiding unhealthy, sugary, greasy foods and following a healthy diet which is composed of fruits and vegetables plays a huge role in the prevention of colon cancer, we decided to ban the selling of unhealthy, sugary and greasy foods in our school canteen. We also tried to promote the importance of eating salads and fruits. After numerous meetings with the canteen, we were finally able to ban the selling of chocolate, chips, soda, gummy bears, and some other types of candies. We were also able to bring stands that sells healthy foods that prevents many types of diseases including colon cancer. The first stand we brought sells nuts, fresh fruits and dried fruit. Second stand we brought sells fruit juices made up of fresh, real fruits. And the last stand we brought sells various types of salads. By this way, we were able to improve the eating habits of people in our school community.</P></SECTION><SECTION class="item col-xs-12 all category14"><H3>Booklet</H3><P>We prepared a booklet containing information about colon cancer, the correct dietary habits and treatment methods to inform people. Our booklet was given to many different schools, our relatives and others. It enabled us to inform people about the significance of correct eating habits and exercising in the prevention of colon cancer.</P></SECTION><SECTION class="item col-xs-12 all category15"><H3>Max Fm</H3><P>To reach more people, we participated in a broadcast talk in a well known radio channel, MaxFM. We had an interview with Özgür Aksuna in his famous morning show. We talked about the importance of a healthy diet and exercise and it’s effect on prevention of colon cancer. We also had the chance to talk about our project, synthetic biology and iGEM. By this way, we reached thousands of people and informed them.</P></SECTION><SECTION class="item col-xs-12 all category16"><H3>The sound of Turkey FM</H3><P>To reach more people we participated in a broadcast talk in another well known radio channel, The Sound of Turkey. We talked about the importance of a healthy diet and exercise and its effect on prevention of the colon cancer.</P></SECTION><SECTION class="item col-xs-12 all category17"><H3>NTV</H3><P>Our interview with Özgür Aksuna gained the attention of NTV reporters and they included us on the News and our interview appeared 5 times in 24 hours period. in their show “Güncel Haberler” meaning “current news”. They filmed us while working in the lab and then they interviewed our primary instructor, Tuğba İnanç Gök, our team leader Göksu Bayrak and a team member, Özgür Can. Our goal was to produce a short clip that addresses everyone about the importance of colon cancer and hence iGEM. We managed to get inside of every house in Turkey and made our voice heard.</P></SECTION><SECTION class="item col-xs-12 all category18"><H3>KANAL D</H3><P>After our appearance on the most popular news Channel NTV, another popular TV channel Kanal D reached us and wanted to interview with the team.
