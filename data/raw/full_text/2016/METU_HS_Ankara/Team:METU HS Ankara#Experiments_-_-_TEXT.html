80% Glycerol Preparation:
Add 80ml 99.7% glycerol to 20ml demineralized water
Autoclave
Digestion:
Restriction Digests
The left part sample is cut out with EcoRI and SpeI.
The right part sample is cut out with XbaI and PstI.
The linearized plasmid backbone is a linear piece of DNA. It has a few bases beyond the EcoRI and PstI restriction sites. It is cut with EcoRI and PstI.
All 3 restriction digests are heated to heat kill all of the restriction enzymes.
An equimolar quantity of all 3 restriction digest products are combined in a ligation reaction.
The desired result is the left part sample's SpeI overhang ligated with the right part sample's XbaI overhang resulting in a scar that cannot be cut with any of our enzymes.
The new composite part sample is ligated into the construction plasmid backbone at the EcoRI and PstI sites.
When the ligation is transformed into cells and grown on plates with antibiotic C, only colonies with the correct construction survive.
Single Reaction
Add 250ng of DNA to be digested, and adjust with dH20 for a total volume of 16ul.
Add 2.5ul of NEBuffer 2.
Add 0.5ul of BSA.
Add 0.5ul of EcoRI.
Add 0.5ul of PstI.
There should be a total volume of 20ul. Mix well and spin down briefly.
Incubate the restriction digest at 37C for 30min, and then 80C for 20min to heat kill the enzymes. We incubate in a thermal cycler with a heated lid
Run a portion of the digest on a gel (8ul, 100ng), to check that both plasmid backbone and part length are accurate.

10 μl Plasmid
6 μl MGW (water)

Growth of cells in culture
The agar stabs contain live bacteria (E. coli) that house your parts. The parts themselves belong to a plasmid which replicates within the E. coli cell.
Before working with our parts, we had to be sure that we have enough copies of them. We did this by growing up cell cultures from the agar stabs: more E. coli cells means more plasmids, which means more copies of our parts. Use the provided agar stabs to streak out the bacteria containing our parts onto agar plates. Then we pick a single colony to grow up a cell culture.
Part A and Part B are both maintained on pSB1AK3 plasmid backbones. The ‘AK’ means that our plasmid backbone is resistant to Ampicillin and Kanamycin antibiotics. When we are growing these parts up, we have to be sure to use media that has these antibiotics, that way we can ensure that only the bacteria containing our parts will grow.

Production of Competent Cell
Competent cells are what we used to grow up and express your ligation result. These cells are modified bacteria which were selected for their transformation ability: their ability to uptake foreign DNA from their surrounding environment and express it. This makes them useful as cellular models of a system, such as the RFP system we’re making in the 3A Assembly kit protocol.
Transformation efficiency is a measure of how “competent” these competent cells are: highly efficient competent cells will yield many more colonies than less efficient competent cells. DNA is provided at different concentrations so teams can determine how sensitive their cells are.
Preparation of  Seed Stocks
To make our own stock of competent cells to use we need to first create seed stocks. Each vial of seed stock can be used to create a separate batch of competent cells, stored in 2.0ml tubes. Transformations are performed using a tube of these competent cells.

Miniprep
After growing up cell cultures of E. coli containing lots of copies of Part A andPart B. In order to access the plasmid DNA containing your part, we need to lyse the cells (make them burst open), separate the DNA from the cellular material, and purify the sample to make sure you only have the plasmid DNA and not the E. coli's own genomic DNA.

Restriction Digest
After miniprepping, we had the plasmid DNA containing Part A and Part B. Part A and Part B, we have to cut them out from their pSB1AK3 plasmid backbones. We uses restriction enzymes to cut the parts out. This will leave small overhangs at the end of each part which will act like connectors to assemble Part A and Part B together into the pSB1C3 linearized backbone, which we will need to digest as well.

Ligation
After your restriction digest we have Part A, Part B, and the pSB1C3 linearized plasmid backbone cut. Now we have  to assemble all of these components together (Part A + Part B, into pSB1C3). We did this by using the overhangs (connectors) we created by cutting the DNA with restriction enzymes and ligase, which will keep everything glued together.

Transformation
We had an assembled product through ligation (Part A + Part B, in pSB1C3). To get this new part into E. coli cells, we  need to use a process called transformation. So it can uptake our ligated product (the plasmid containing your new part). Once the cells have taken in our plasmid, we had grow them on a chloramphenicol plate (only cells containing the pSB1C3 plasmid backbone will live), and from those cells that live, there will be red colonies that have the correct new part.

Induction Protocol:
If the protein is membrane-bound , expression in mutant strains C41 , BL21 DE3 and C43(DE3) could improve expression levels.
Expression method
Picking of a single colony from a freshly streaked plate of the expression host containing the recombinant vector. When the heterologous protein is toxic for the cells , higher expression levels are obtained by using the so-called ‘plating’ method.
Growing of a starter culture.
Inoculate with the picked up colony to 50 ml of LB medium containing appropriate antibiotic.
When a larger starter culture is required , inoculate 4ml of rich media with single colony ; grow for 4-8 hours at 37°C and use this to inoculate the starter culture.
(Don’t let cultures grow at 37°C overnight !)
It is better to grow overnight cultures at 30°C or lower . Alternatively ,the culture can be incubated at 37°C until OD600 is approx. 1. Then store the culture at 4°C overnight. Following morning , collect the cells by centrifugation , resuspend them in fresh medium and use this to inoculate the main culture.
Inoculation of the main culture and incubation until OD600  reaches 0,4-L. The optimal OD value depends on the culture method and the medium. For flask cultures using LB-medium on  OD600  of  0.6 recommended. To increase growth rate we carry out the cultures at 37°C until the OD for induction is reached. Then the cultures are cooled to the induction temperature in ice-water.
Induction of protein Expression
After induction the cultures are are incubated from 3 hours to overnight depending on the induction temprature. Guide lines are below;
Harvesting of the cell pellet by centrifugation ( 20 min at 6000 g ). Cell pellets are stored at -20°C.
E. coli BL21 (DE3) & E. coli K12 M6 1665 Coculture with CaCo-2 Trial Protocol
E. coli cultures were grown overnight and used in the early stationary phase.
Started from on overnight pre-cultured , stationary phase ( OD > 2)
100 μl sample ( E. coli : pre-culture ) +10ml LB
37°C , 200 rpm , 16 hours
OD600 measurement  → OD600 = 1.0 means we have  8 x 108 cells 1ml , OD600 = 2.0 → 1,6 x 109 cells 1ml ( assumed as stationary phase )
Co-culture
CaCo-2 cells were infected with a bacteria at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1000 in 10 ml of cell culture media lacking antibiotics.
This means for 1 cell- 1000 bacteria.
We are growing 3 x 104  cell / well, therefore 3 x 107  bacteria is required. Overall, 1x 109 from each strain is needed.
Determine the amount of well for co-culture.
i.e: K12- 25 well x (3 x 107 ) = 75 x 107 needed
Measure OD600 and find out how many cell/ml you have.
i.e; We have 12,8 x 108 /ml in culture of bacteria.
Decide them to find out the amount to centrifuge.
i.e; (75 x 107) / (12,8 x 108 ) =0,585≈0,600
Centrifuge (600 μl) from each bacterial culture.
Remove flow-through and resuspend in 500 μl medium. (Now, medium is used for cancer cell. However, we could create new media. (mix of EMEM&LB)
500 μl media is needed for each well.Then, 500μl x 25 well= 12,5 ml
Prepare media (EMEM) as substracted the amount that we have used to resuspend bacterial strains. So, 12 ml + 500 μl media (resuspended bacteria) =12,5 ml
3hr, 6 hr, 9hr overnight 24 well plates were prepared to carry K12, BL21 and cells only.
12,5 ml of K12, BL21 and EMEM medium were distributed equally and placed into incubator. (No shaking! But maybe we need very slow shaking if we use early passage of  CaCo-2.
After incubation, plates were washed with PBS as 500 μl for each well. (3 times)
1,25 ml MTT is mixed with 11,25 PBS (total 12,5 ml) and distributed each well as 500 μl after washing.
After 4 hours incubation with MTT, add 500 μl SDS (as we have described preparation of SDS) to each well and leave overnight.
