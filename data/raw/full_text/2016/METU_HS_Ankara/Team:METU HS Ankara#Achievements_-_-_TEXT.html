Silver
We’ve experimentally validated and documented the characterization of BBa_K2052014 in the iGEM Parts Registry.
We’ve collaborated with over 10 registered iGEM team and helped each other in significant ways. More information can be found in our Collaborations page.
We’ve identified , investigated and addressed important issues beyond the lab bench by numerous Human Practices we’ve made. More information can be found in our Human Practice page.
Gold
We’ve improved and expanded on our Human Practice activities. More information can be found in our Integrated Human Practices page.
*CAD1 (cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase) enzyme that we were interested previous year was characterized with Fehling colorimetric assay. This year we wanted to show construct work with pSB1C3 vector on protein gel and we were successful. More information can be found at the part registry, Part K1658000, Cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase CAD1
We’ve demonstrated a functional proof of concept of our project. More information can be found in our Proof of Concept page.
We’ve created a prototype that shows our project working under real-life conditions.The prototype we designed represents the stages of colon cancer and how our project works during those stages.
PROJECT ACHIEVEMENTS
We cloned FimH, double terminator and arabinose induced promoter to pSB1C3 backbone and shared the gel images for them. After designing primers, we did PCR to confirm this part.
We cloned RBS and ButCoAT enzyme (which we obtained from Roseburia intestinalis by doing codon bias to our E. coli) to pSB1C3 backbone and shared the gel images. After designing primers, we did PCR to confirm this part.
We tried our experiments with expression vector, pet28a, however, after hundreds of trials, we failed to get a successful result. So we decided to change our method and used our parts with pSB1C3 backbone to conduct the experiments. By adding GFP to FimH part and RFP to ButCoAT part we designed two new parts which included GFP and RFP. After completing this constructs, we observed a radiation in green color for FimH and a radiation in red color for ButCoAT. We proved them with our gel images.
In final stage we did co-culture with cancer cells in which we observed green colored cells around them that indicated binding of our E. coli, then red colors that indicated the production of butyrate.
