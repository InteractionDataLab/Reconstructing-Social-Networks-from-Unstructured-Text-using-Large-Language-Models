                   People in our school became aware of the iGEM competition after a school club
                    was made under the name “iGEM”. After two years of its establishment and its
                    success in the iGEM competition last year, students learned what this club was all
                    about and they became interested in it. Hence lots of students gathered in this
                    club.

                    

                    Our team, METU HS iGEM consists of students from different age groups
                    and with a variety of personalities. And our diversity is what makes this team so
                    vibrant and full of color. But as well as our differences, we also have our
                    similarities; we all like biology and creativity. Most of us wanted to join this team
                    to obtain an experience in a worldwide famous competition like iGEM, because
                    most of us are planning to study biology in the future.

                    

                    Just like any other team in iGEM, we had our ups and downs during our times of
                    work. But eventually we learned that nothing can be achieved without working
                    hard and as the time passed we learned to work in union. We accepted our
                    differences and became like brothers and sisters with each other. We had quite
                    hard time determining our project idea but as we worked harder and researched
                    more, we found our most suitable project idea. We love going to the lab and put
                    some music on and sing and have fun as we work. We especially love treating
                    bacteria that we’ve cloned as our sons and daughters. We had so much fun doing
                    our human practices and helped the society to raise awareness about colon
                    cancer.
                     
                    As a team, we think that iGEM is surely more than a synthetic biology
                    competition because it provided us to think creatively and improve our problem
                    solving skills. We are all glad that we joined the iGEM family and grateful that we met
                    each other within this team.

                   ODTÜ Geliştirme Vakfi Özel Lisesi (Middle East Technical University Development Foundation Private High School),was established in 1989 in the capital city of Turkey, Ankara. It has 4 seperate campuses located in different cities.
               </P><P>
                   Our school is authorized by the ministry of education, as are all public and private schools in Turkey, and the curriculum is standardized from k-12 by the ministry of education in Turkey.
               </P><P>
                   Our school sees students to be the embodiment of their knowledge, skills, feelings and behavior as a whole. In addition to its regular academic program, the school offers a wide range of extra-curricular academic, social, cultural and sports activities. Besides the students have the opportunity of joining international clubs, iGem is one of them. The school emphasizes social responsibility projects and activities where students work together to help solve social and environmental problems.

All iGEM steps and processes require hard working but nothing makes me happier than seeing how fun synthetic biology is and makes students enthusiastic in the field of area. I was always interested in synthetic biology and genetic engineering, but the best part is to explore this world with my students.

I just love how a group of students gather under the name of iGEM, sit down and try and find answers to serious problems. All in all, I’m very glad to be an iGEMmer and hope our results will be satisfying.

I’m Göksu a.k.a. Nanodrop Master, a junior student in METU High School. It’s my first year in this competition and I’m so glad to be a part of the METU HS ANKARA team. I think that iGEM is a great opportunity for me to gain knowledge about genetics. For me, learning brand-new things is like exploring the countries I have never been before. I also enjoy making research and doing experiments so much. Besides, I want to study molecular biology in the future that also encourages me to attend the competition. Good luck to all teams that are in iGEM 2016, see you at Giant Jamboree. Peace out!</P></DIV><SPAN class="md-close tz-md-close"><EM> Close </EM></SPAN></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="speaker_box"><DIV class="tz_our_speakers md-trigger tz_md_effect_16" data-modal="modal-16"><DIV class="tz_our_speakers_img"><DIV class="tz_our_speakers_social"><DIV class="ds-table"><DIV class="ds-table-cell"><SPAN class="tz_text_hover_speaker" data-modal="modal-16"> view profile </SPAN></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="tz_our_speakers_container"><H4> Gizem Karaaslan </H4><SPAN> The Transformer </SPAN></DIV></DIV><DIV class="tz-md-modal-speakers md-modal md-effect-16 modal-16"><DIV class="md-content container"><DIV class="tz_modal_title"><H4 class="tz_modal_name">Gizem Karaaslan</H4><SPAN class="tz_modal_employment">The Transformer</SPAN></DIV><DIV class="tz_modal_speakers_content"><P>Hello! My name is Gizem Karaaslan, a.k.a The Transformer. This is my first year in METU HS iGEM Team. I am sixteen years old and had already been enthralled by the world of biology. From tiny little cells to huge organisms everything intrigues me so much. With iGEM, I have a chance to get some answers to the crazy questions in my head, experience the wonderful atmosphere of lab and hone my research skills. So I am very happy to be a part of this year’s team and will forever treasure the memories I made here.</P></DIV><SPAN class="md-close tz-md-close"><EM> Close </EM></SPAN></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="speaker_box"><DIV class="tz_our_speakers md-trigger tz_md_effect_16" data-modal="modal-16"><DIV class="tz_our_speakers_img"><DIV class="tz_our_speakers_social"><DIV class="ds-table"><DIV class="ds-table-cell"><SPAN class="tz_text_hover_speaker" data-modal="modal-16"> view profile </SPAN></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="tz_our_speakers_container"><H4> Ezel Erkan </H4><SPAN> Human Resources </SPAN></DIV></DIV><DIV class="tz-md-modal-speakers md-modal md-effect-16 modal-16"><DIV class="md-content container"><DIV class="tz_modal_title"><H4 class="tz_modal_name">Ezel Erkan</H4><SPAN class="tz_modal_employment">Human Resources</SPAN></DIV><DIV class="tz_modal_speakers_content"><P>Hi, everyone!  I’m Ezel Erkan and it’s my second year in METU High School Ankara iGEM Team. I love genetics very much. So, I thought that iGEM would be my favorite extra-curricular activity. I really enjoy doing experiments and making research about biology. Therefore, I want iGEM to be in my life in the future too. iGEM makes me think about things that seem very unimportant at first sight but are worth to be researched further and discovered and increased my interest in molecular biology. Furthermore, it makes me enthusiastic in the field of area. Finally;  I want to thank my awesome team; for their excellent teamwork and for having a lot of fun.</P></DIV><SPAN class="md-close tz-md-close"><EM> Close </EM></SPAN></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="speaker_box"><DIV class="tz_our_speakers md-trigger tz_md_effect_16" data-modal="modal-16"><DIV class="tz_our_speakers_img"><DIV class="tz_our_speakers_social"><DIV class="ds-table"><DIV class="ds-table-cell"><SPAN class="tz_text_hover_speaker" data-modal="modal-16"> view profile </SPAN></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="tz_our_speakers_container"><H4>Zeynep Sakaoglu</H4><SPAN>Queen of Isolation</SPAN></DIV></DIV><DIV class="tz-md-modal-speakers md-modal md-effect-16 modal-16"><DIV class="md-content container"><DIV class="tz_modal_title"><H4 class="tz_modal_name">Zeynep Sakaoglu</H4><SPAN class="tz_modal_employment">Queen of Isolation</SPAN></DIV><DIV class="tz_modal_speakers_content"><P>Hi!
