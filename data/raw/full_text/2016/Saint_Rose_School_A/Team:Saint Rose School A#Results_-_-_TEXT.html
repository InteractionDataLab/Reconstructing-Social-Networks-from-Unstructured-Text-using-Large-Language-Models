After carrying out laboratory work, the way we used to check if our work was successful was through electrophoresis using agarose gel 0.8; 1.2 and 1.5 depending on its need.  Our laboratory work began in June this year and since then, we have been working. Now, we will see our performance in Lux:
July 8th: our samples failed to be clear.
July 22nd: Too heated, without result.
July 22nd: the sample was too heated again, and we did not abtained any result.
July 23rd: performed in a small chamber gel 1.5, with Plux promoter, we weren´t able to see the two bands as espected..
July 30th: No result was obtained from all samples, it will be repeated.
August 5th: the expected samples could be clearly seen, the third tends to have two bands.
August 10th: plasmids concentrates, all the samples were completely able to be seen, getting the expected result.
August 12th: we turned to repeat samples to make sure everything is correct, then the plasmids were sent to cryogenics.
