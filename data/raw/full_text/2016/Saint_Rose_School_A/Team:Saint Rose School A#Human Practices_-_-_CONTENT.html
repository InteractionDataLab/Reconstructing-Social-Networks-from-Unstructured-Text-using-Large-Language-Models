Visit of Minister of Economy Mr. Luis Felipe Cespedes to a science fair that we organize to promote our projects about synthetic biology. We explain what was synthetic biology and how it could help our society. We chatted about how our project is a solution to a big problem we have as a country and how science is a super powerful tool to solve our problems.

The representative of CORFO (Corporation for Promotion of Production) was very interested in how being so young, we undertake in our project. He really liked that we focused our research to solve real problems of the country. He said that when we had a prototype ready, they could support as CORFO to develop it more professionally.
<STRONG>2.- Formal presentations mentors </STRONG>
We made formal presentations to researchers from the center of genomics and bioinformatics at the University Mayor (http://www.umayor.cl/genomica/) to technically discuss about how our project develops and listen to their recommendations. As researchers from different areas, we discuss biosafety and bioethics and how to handle these issues in our projects.
