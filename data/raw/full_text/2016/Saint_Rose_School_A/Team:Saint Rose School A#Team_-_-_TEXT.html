TEAM
We are a group of five high school students, which aim to promote science in a different, more entertaining and easier way to understand for others. All our performance has been achieved by our perseverance and the help of our tutors. In our team we all have different likes; however, we have joined for a reason: science, in which we have shared very good moments as well as moments of great stress, working late hours and many days in a row, reaching to the conclusion that the life of a scientist is not "easy". This experience has helped us to understand how we are going to develop in the future, realizing that all of us will study something that has to do with biology or health.

“biological engineering”
I am 16 years old, I am a high school student with high skills in science; I have headed the project from the beginning until June 2016, where for group decision I was followed by a partner. In July this year I was invited to participate in the Summer School Global Imperial College London to gain more knowledge and allowed me to strengthen the team in science field. I like working in the laboratory but more in theoretical work, I am also part of the translation of written work. My goal is the study of biological engineering abroad, and working on stem cells and research in aging process.
Hobbies
I like to read (specifically about science), jogging, playing videogames and volunteerism. Also I study classical piano and enjoy outdoor activities.

"Medicine"
I'm a high school student. My top priorities are the welfare of the team; encourage it to work and to be more responsible, because these attitudes I have been appointed as the group leader. I love the laboratory work, my performance is good and I enjoy it very much, however, I have worked more on developing presentations, and everything that has to do with computing. Later on, I hope to be an excellent biologist, so that in the future I would achieve my dream that is to study Medicine or something related to science, conducting research, and in parallel to be a professional volleyball player.
Hobbies
my passions are volleyball and science; I also like jogging, hanging out with friends and watch TV series.
Luis Retamal:
"Neurology"
I am a 15 years old high school student; I am in charge of caring of these girls as I am the only man in our group. What I like is working in the laboratory; pipetting, however I am a collaborator in the literature search work and the advertising design. Nevertheless, I am teased repeatedly because I'm the only man in the group and when they talk to the group they often use the term "girls". Later on I would like to work on something related to Medicine, without forgetting my passion for the outdoor life and my creative traits, but mostly what I want for my future is to be happy in whatever I do.
Hobbies
I'm a scout, I am passionate about outdoors, I consider myself creative and I like sports.

“Nutrition”
I´m a high school student. In the project I’m the one who provides the direction of our research, organizing the information that my teammates develop, in this way, I help the advance of our research and also by correcting spelling mistakes. In addition, I try to help my teammates with their problems and thus trying to seek a solution to these. In the future, I still am not sure about what I want to study, it can be nutrition or medical technology, but I hope to fully enjoy what I do. Another goal of mine is to travel and see the world, so I can to have experiences to tell.
Hobbies
I like dancing, listening to music, going out with friends, and also training crossfit.

"Marine biology"
I'm a high school student. My contribution to the team is to be the harmony of the group up to being a clown, so that other people feel happy and can have a good time. I like working in a laboratory rather than doing the theoretical work, but I have actively participated in the writing tasks, the bibliographic work, and the presentations design and also in the science fairs. My main goal in life is to study marine biology at the Universidad Austral in Chile and to work in the Caribbean beaches and marine reserves, and in parallel with it, I would to take photography and rescue courses.
Hobbies
I like to share with friends, to practice crossfit training, outdoor activities, and animals, but above all things, science.
