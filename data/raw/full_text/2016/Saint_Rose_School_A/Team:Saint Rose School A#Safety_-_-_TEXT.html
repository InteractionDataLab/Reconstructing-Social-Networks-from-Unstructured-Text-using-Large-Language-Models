Safety
To ensure the safety of our team and our aimed audience, we take many steps to prevent the possibility of some kind of risk between us and our audience. These are the measures we have used:
Safety in the laboratory to avoid any physical injury, proper behavior in the laboratory was followed at all times. This behavior includes:
Use of gloves and apron.
Disinfection of the working area.
Use of chlorine to sterilize unused crops
The maintenance of a clean and tidy working environment.
In the case of women, have hair pinned up at all times.
Keep food and drink outside the laboratory.
Security inside the device:
To meet biosafety standards will decided to have a security option by implementing to our device "Self Lysis", an efficient mechanism to destroy the E. coli, bacteria.This auto lysis device has three very important proteins: the BRP (bacteriocin releasing protein ) that degrades the outer membrane, Lysozyme:that degrades the peptidoglycan layer, and Holin:that degrades the inner membrane. Self Lysis is activated with the pBAD promoter, which is responsible for the rapid induction, allowing a better control of the lysis time. This mechanism will be within this bacterium in a special culture medium GCM, in this culture medium, the E.coli bacteria and choanoflagellate will coexist. When autolysis activates, the E.coli Â will die and the choanoflagellate will digest it, then the choanoflagellate also will die because of the content of soot that the E.Coli will have.
It is determined that the culture medium GCM is used since it is compatible with the two organisms mentioned above.
