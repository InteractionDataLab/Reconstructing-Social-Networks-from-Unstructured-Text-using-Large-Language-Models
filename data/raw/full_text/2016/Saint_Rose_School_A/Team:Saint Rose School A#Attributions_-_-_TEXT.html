As a group we want to acknowledge the help of the people who were with us in the development of our project, because without them we would not be where we are now. Ismael Espinoza is the organizer of our process at the Academy of entrepreneurship, he has helped us in the legal and financial issues of the trip. He also gave us lessons of entrepreneurship.
Javier Villacreces was our professor of molecular biology and genetic engineering. He has been a major advance in our process in the laboratory, working on the wiki and presentations pillar has been our guardian and is responsible for motivating us to be more responsible and to continue working. We also had the help of Oyarce Sebastian and Ana Del Valle who were always there to help us with any questions or problems within the laboratory. Adding the group in 2014 IGEM that shared their experience, and it was important to learn more in depth about the competition. We also had help from the English teacher of our school Rocio Astudillo, who helped us both with presentations and exhibitions of the project and the translation of parts of our wiki, also had English lessons with her for about two months. On the other hand, the teacher of our school Cristian Ramirez has been the guardian of our project, he has supported us in the most intimate aspects of the group, being present to solve our problems, and he has also helped on the legal issues and those related to the travel.
Earlier in the Middle East Technical University, they were devoted to sequence the genes that are responsible for the detection of carbon monoxide in the R.Rubrum, this protobacteria is characterized by the color purple photosynthetic may behave in an aerobic or anaerobic manner, this group managed to identify two circuits designated as pCoof detecting low levels and high levels pCooM detecting promoters. From this first initiative to understand these sequences, and inserting chromoproteins our team used these sequences and Lux ​​system to generate a third intermediate level of detection.
