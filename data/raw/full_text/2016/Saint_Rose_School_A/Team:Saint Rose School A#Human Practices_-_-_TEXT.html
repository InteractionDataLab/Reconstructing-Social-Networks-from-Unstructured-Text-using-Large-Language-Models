Human Practices
These are the main stages we have had in our time at the Academia de Emprendimiento Científico.
In the Academy we had synthetic biology, entrepreneurship and advertisement lessons. We also learnt to be more responsible,  to define goals and achieve them.
We met the economy- CORFO minister (Luis Felipe Cèspedes) during a scientific fair organized by Universidad Mayor to present the work. CORFO representative said that they could help us to develop our project, but first we would need a prototyp.
The project has been presented several times to different mentors (researchers from the genomic center at Universidad Mayor)  to talk about the developing of the project. Associating bioethics and biosecurity to our work  have been one of the major topics discussed.
We participated in a scientific fair in the GAM (one of the most important cultural centres in Chile) where we showed our project and talked about synthetic biology to more than 400 people.
In the Academy we also had drama classes at Universidad Mayor, in order to improve our public speaking abilities and doing good presentations
The project was presented at the Party of science and technology organized by EXPLORA (a program of the Ministry of Education). We talked to the public about synthetic biology, the development and impact of our project. More than 5000 attended to this event.
We had a meeting with the PhD Program of Integrative Genomics at Universidad Mayor: Emiliano Vicencio, Luis Labrador and Cristian Bergmann, and also with part of the Core Team of Vegetal Biotechnology of Universidad Mayor: Gabriela Pastor, Carlos Rosales and Emilio Mensing. Thanks to this talk, we clarified some aspect of our biologic device.
In order to make our project something suitable to the needs of people: we went to ask them in the streets, made some brainstorming, worked on a business model and some other activities.
Dissemination activities of synthetic biology and the work that has been done:
1.- Share with the Minister of Economy - CORFO - Science Fair
Visit of Minister of Economy Mr. Luis Felipe Cespedes to a science fair that we organize to promote our projects about synthetic biology. We explain what was synthetic biology and how it could help our society. We chatted about how our project is a solution to a big problem we have as a country and how science is a super powerful tool to solve our problems.
The representative of CORFO (Corporation for Promotion of Production) was very interested in how being so young, we undertake in our project. He really liked that we focused our research to solve real problems of the country. He said that when we had a prototype ready, they could support as CORFO to develop it more professionally.
2.- Formal presentations mentors
We made formal presentations to researchers from the center of genomics and bioinformatics at the University Mayor (http://www.umayor.cl/genomica/) to technically discuss about how our project develops and listen to their recommendations. As researchers from different areas, we discuss biosafety and bioethics and how to handle these issues in our projects.
3.- GAM Fair
We had a great show at the GAM (http://gam.cl/) of synthetic biology where we show our project against more than 400 people, talked of synthetic biology, iGEM competition and explain the impact of our project solve a serious problem as a country.
4.- Festival of Science - EXPLORE
Participate of the feast of science EXPLORE (http://www.explora.cl/), of Ministry of Education, where more than 5,000 people attended and we could have all our work, talked of synthetic biology competition iGEM and explain the impact of our project to solve a serious problem as a country.
5.- Validation of the idea
To reach our prototype we went to ask several people what they thought, we did brainstorming, business model work and other activities to develop a product that was ideal for our needs as a country.
6.- Training
We are prepared to present for that we went to drama school at the Universidad Mayor and made us acting classes, movement and voice, to put together an excellent presentation
7.- Mentors
In addition to researchers from the center of genomics and bioinformatics at the University Mayor (http://www.umayor.cl/genomica/) and the support of our teacher at the school and our instructor Javier Villacreses. We had the visit of mentors from other universities in the country to advise us if we were on the right track in our Project
