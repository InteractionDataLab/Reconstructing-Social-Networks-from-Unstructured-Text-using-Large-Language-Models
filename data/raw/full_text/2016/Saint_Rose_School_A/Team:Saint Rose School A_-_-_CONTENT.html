Currently there are only electrochemical sensors that perceive the presence of this gas, however, we propose a biological detector that is easy to use, this device has sensors based on promoters that detect levels of CO, which is a characteristic of the protobacteria R.rubrum, which makes use of carbon monoxide as its main source of energy. Through synthetic biology is possible to transfer these characteristics to other organisms such as E. coli, which in nature has no connection and the transfer of its genetic information is incompatible with this, allowing for innovative advances in scientific applications such as the creation of a biological CO detector to later incorporate this system into an accessory.</H5></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="container"><H1 class="text">Our story</H1><P id="parts" style="text-align:justify">We are a group of five students of 2nd Senior Year from Saint Rose School, passionate about synthetic biology. In mid 2015 we were part of a scientific workshop of our school, which was directed by the teacher Luis Contreras and its purpose was to promote science .In the beginning we were eight students, but time went by and we were five. Lately, our group had the chance to be part of the “Academia de Emprendimiento Científico” of Universidad Mayor De Chile, where we learnt about synthetic biology and entrepreneurship. This was crucial, because it has helped us in all the aspects of our project, from devise, design, and work in the lab with the  plasmids selected to convert The CO Tracker in something ideal for a public who may need it.
From September to December of 2016, we had theoretical lessons of synthetic biology, advertising and economics;  these classes helped us to define several aspects of our project. Through January of 2016 we worked in the lab so we could have a solid foundation of the use of equipment and instruments.                       
From April to mid-July we had theoric lessons about how to improve and advance in our project, during this term we had a new tutor, Cristian Ramírez, who has been with us until now, and by the end of July we started our practical-lab project so we were able to put into operation our scientific project.

"> Initially, our teacher in charge of the scientific project, Luis Contreras was our tutor since we started with the project until the end of December 2015. Unfortunately, due to some problems with the school, he was not able to continue with us. In January, other tutor was assigned to our group, Miss Giglia Veloso, who was with us until the end of February, even though, due to personal problems she couldn't continue with her role as a tutor.
After summer break, teacher Cristian Ramirez became our definitive tutor, and he has been with us until the IGEM competition. </P></DIV><SECTION id="container" style="display: inline-block;"><DIV class="iconproject"><A class="project" href="https://2016.igem.org/Team:Saint_Rose_School_A/Description#problem" style="color:#0650a0">PROBLEM</A></DIV><DIV class="iconproject"><A class="project" href="https://2016.igem.org/Team:Saint_Rose_School_A/Description#solution" style="color:#0650a0">SOLUTION</A></DIV><DIV class="iconproject"><A class="project" href="https://2016.igem.org/Team:Saint_Rose_School_A/Description#design" style="color:#0650a0">DESIGN</A></DIV><DIV class="iconproject"><A class="project" href="https://2016.igem.org/Team:Saint_Rose_School_A/Description#parts" style="color:#0650a0">PARTS</A></DIV><DIV class="iconproject"><A class="project" href="https://2016.igem.org/Team:Saint_Rose_School_A/Description#method" style="color:#0650a0">METHOD</A></DIV></SECTION></DIV><DIV class="content_wrapper"><SECTION id="notebook"><A href="https://2016.igem.org/Team:Saint_Rose_School_A/Notebook" class="btn btn-primary" style="margin-top: 260px; color:#fff;font-size: 16px; padding: 6px 32px;font-weight: 300;">Read more Notebook</A></SECTION><DIV class="container"><P id="parts" style="font-size:80px; font-weight:800">Results</P><P id="notebook" style="text-align:justify">After carrying out laboratory work, the way we used to check if our work was successful was through electrophoresis using agarose gel 0.8; 1.2 and 1.5 depending on its need.  Our laboratory work began in June this year and since then, we have been working.
