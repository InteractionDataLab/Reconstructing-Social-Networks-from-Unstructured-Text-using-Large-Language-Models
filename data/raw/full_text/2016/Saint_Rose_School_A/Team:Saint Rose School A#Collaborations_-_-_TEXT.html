"The CO tracker" is made possible by the Academy of scientific endeavor of the Universidad Mayor de Chile, which has given us the necessary tools to develop our project, which are the laboratory and development as a team.Â  In addition to the academy we have received help from the IGEM 2015 Team San Andres school "Gluten's job", who have shared the experience we had, about how it will make the competition IGEM team. Also students of the PhD program in Integrative Genomics at the University Mayor, gave us suggestions to define certain parts of our biological circuit also prepared us to understand the possible questions that might face us in the representation of IGEM.
