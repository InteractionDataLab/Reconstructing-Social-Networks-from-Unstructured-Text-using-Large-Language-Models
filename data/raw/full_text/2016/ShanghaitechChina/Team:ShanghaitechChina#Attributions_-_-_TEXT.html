Special Notes:iGEM is the first lab experience for many members on our team. It was the training and guidance of the host labs that put us onto the right track for carrying out the independent project, Solar Hunter. On this page, we show our acknowledgement sincerely by clearly attributing the help from the graduate students and instructors at the beginning of each section, as different graduate students were involved in different aspects of the project.

Special Notes:We applied for the flow cytometry through the manager teacher Ren Xiaoyue. She also tutored us the basic operation and the preparation of our samples. We prepared the samples by ourselves.

Special Notes:In this part Yan Nie provided us with the original bacteria of PirLC to make the component cell and the transformed PirLC with the plasmid backbone.The molecular cloning in this section was done in Yan Nieâ€™s Lab, SIAIS. The help of Yan Nie was involved in the the beginning, but the principle is that all of the experiments are done by ourselves.  Yilin Sun provided us with the tutorials of Snapgene and primer design.The sequencing is provided by Tsingke Sequencing and Jie Li Sequencing .Qixi Mi is a PI from School of Physical Science and Technology. Zetao Ding is his Ph.D student. In the hydrogen production assay, they provided us with the instrument/apparatus he used for hydrogen production assay in his lab. He trained for using the apparatus and most of the experiments were conducted by us.

Special Notes: Bolin An is the leading graduate instructor/advisor in this section. He provided basic cloning training (PCR, restriction, ligation, Gibson, electrophoresis, Colony PCR, blast) at the beginning of the cloning of his-CsgA-SpyCatcher-his, the purification of proteins at the subsection of Expression and Purification of mCherry-SpyTag, and consult throughout the summer and fall. In addition, all florescent microscope experiments were conducted with the supervision of Bolin An. TEM is conducted with the help of Xinyu Wang. However, the preparation of the samples were done by ourselves.

Special Notes: Jiahua Ou and Xinyu Wang are two graduate instructors/advisors in the QD section. Pu provided guidance on our experiments including the synthesis of CdSe QDs and CdS NRs and  UV-Vis spectrometer characterization. Wang helped in the synthesis of NTA ligand, TEM characterization and PL spectrometer characterization.
