</P><P>When shed by light, QDs and NRs would capture photons with high energy, resulting in the excitation of electrons from low energy levels to higher ones. Without mediators, the unstable electrons would perform spontaneous transition to low energy levels. This electron transition would result in photoluminescence phenomenon and emit photons at specific wavelengths.
On the other hand, if in the presence of electron mediators such as enzyme, the electron with high energy would transfer to the enzyme and participate in the catalysis reactions [1], <B>this fact has originally inspired us to utilize QDs and NRs to assist hydrogenases to drive hydrogen production. </B></P><CENTER><DIV><FIGCAPTION><P class="cap"><B>Figure 1.</B> Different types of QDs with varied size and chemistry show different colors under UV light</P></FIGCAPTION></DIV></CENTER><P>Besides the difference in energy band structure and other chemical attributes, we take great interest in the difference in the shapes of the nanocrystals. After thorough literature research, we found that the merits of NRs, a one-dimension nanomaterial, may overweigh QDsâ€™, a zero-dimension nanomaterial, in biohybrid catalysis in terms of their potential to induce conformational changes of enzymes and facilitate their biological functions if the shape fits. As suggested by a recent publication[1], the CdS NRs may contribute to N<SUB>2</SUB> production by inducing the conformational changes of nitrogenase. Therefore, we utilize a simple nanorods, CdS NRs and a typical quantum dots, CdSe QDs, for the comparison of catalysis efficiency in our projects.
 </P><P>
Ligand is also an important feature of nanocrystals. The presence of some types of ligands would increase the difficulty of growth on some lattice plane while decrease it on the others, leading to NRs using QDs as nuclei. A ligand not only can serve as a stabilizer in solution but also a functional decoration for nanocrystals. In our experiements, the product QDs and NRs are originally synthesized with lipophilic ligands and dissolve in nonpolar organic solvents such as octadecene and trioctylphophine.  Ligand exchanging would allow the products to enter into water phase and thereby enable ligand-decorated QDs that would be able to bind to biofilms. The ligand we used has a NTA functional group, which was developed by the Zhong group at ShanghaiTech (Patent application submitted). NTA-capped QDs or NRs can firmly bind with His-tagged CsgA, major protein components of E. coli biofilms. In addition, we further utilize this specific binding system and unique optical properties of QDs to scrutinize the expression and formation of biofilms (as revealed in our biofilms session).

To increase the solubility and enable selective binding ability of the nanomaterials, the lipophilic ligands of our synthesized nanomaterials should be replaced by special ligands through ligand exchange. We used a well-developed procedure (developed in Zhong Lab@ShanghaiTech) to synthesize this ligand. We performed the ligand exchange experiment to replace the origin ligand of the nanomaterials. The result of ligand exchange experiment was shown by the following image. After this experiment, the nanomaterials were ready to be harnessed as the binding material of the biofilm and the solar energy harvester of the Solar Hunter.</P><P><BUTTON type="button2" id="2"><B>Ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectroscopy:</B></BUTTON></P><P id="x2" class="vis">

The Ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectroscopy is an absorption spectroscopy in the near-UV and visible spectral region. The UV-Vis spectroscopy is normally used as a quantitative and qualitative characterization for different analytes. As QDs and NRs solutions contain large amount of transition metal irons, they exhibit absorption in UV-Vis range due to stimulated transision. And after determined the molar absorptivity(Îµ) from the concentration of Cd<SUP>2+</SUP>, the molarity can be calculated by the following equation: </P><CENTER><P id="x3" class="vis">A=ÎµBC</P></CENTER><P id="x4" class="vis">In the equation, A(Abs) refers to absorption; Îµ(Abs*cm<SUP>-1</SUP>*M<SUP>-1</SUP>) refers to molar absorptivity; B(cm) refers to the length of cuvette; C(M) refers to the molarity of the QD or NR solution.The UV-Vis spectrometer we use is Agilent Cary 5000.</P><P><BUTTON type="button3" id="3"><B>Photoluminescence(PL) spectroscopy:</B></BUTTON></P><P id="x5" class="vis">
The Photoluminescence(PL) spectroscopy is a widely used tool for characterization of electronic and optical properties of analytes, especially quantum dots and nanorods. Briefly, the PL spectroscopy detects photon emitted in a certain spectral region when the samples are excited by light at a certain wavelength. The PL spectroscopy can be used to determine the excitation peak and emission peak. The position of the emission peak can indicate whether the synthesis of QDs and NRs is successfully performed. The best excitation wavelength and the best emission wavelength, which are of great importance for utilizing the use of QDs and NRs as characterization tools, can also be known from the position of the peaks. The PL spectrometer we use is HORIBA FL-3.</P><P><BUTTON type="button4" id="4"><B>Transmission Electron Microscope(TEM):</B></BUTTON></P><P id="x6" class="vis">
Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM) was used to image the shapes and sizes of QDs and NRs. The 120KV TEM (National protein facility center, Shanghai, China) we used provides the resolution of around 0.2nm. The TEM sample of our lipophilic QDs and NRs solution is prepared by simply dropping 10 Î¼L of the solution on to the copper grid.

We synthesized CdS nanorods following a procedure adapted from a previously published protocol[1].
