Yi Liu
Team Leader
He's a junior student in Shanghaitech University, majoring in Biology. This year, he played a role of leader mainly in experiment at the iGEM team of ShanghaitechChina, responsible for the hydrogenase part and final demonstration of the whole project. With hairs on the head blow and less, he finally completed the mission.
Haolong Zhu
Team Leader
He is a senior undergraduate student studying in School of Life Science and Technology at ShanghaiTech University. He shares a broad study interests especially in synthetic biology, systems biology, and developmental biology.
Lechen Qian
Team Vice Leader
She is in charge of coordinating two subgroups in team and orchestrating all parts of work. She brought inspitation to the whole team and the project. Besides, she made effort in lab work in biofilm expression and characterization experiment. She’s now in her third year majoring Life Science at ShanghaiTech University. And she’s been quite fascinated with an interdisciplinary approach of study after this one-year IGEM experience.
Jiaming Zhang
Team Member
He's now a sophomore in School of Physical Science. However, his encyclopedic knowledge and broad interest lead him dive into myriad academic areas. Although his major is physics, he took charge of the nanomaterials synthesis part and propelled the whole project to a large extent.
Shijie Gu
Team Member
Shijie Gu is biology lover, willing to explore as much as he can before settling on one specific topic. This year, he joined iGEM at ShanghaiTech as his first try in bioengineering. Although this summer was the first long-period lab commitment for him, he nevertheless quickly absorbed different styles in lab and developed a style of his own. His open as well as a little pushy predisposition also let him bring in different ideas to the host lab of our project, and was regarded as an interesting…funny one. His contribution of the project mainly consists of the cloning of the biofilm section. In addition, his interests in art has greatly contributed to the iGEM project as well, from logo designing to video making.
Yifan Chen
Team Member
He is a junior student at ShanghaiTech University. He is a very enterprising person and came up with the name of our team, Solar Hunter. Last semester he worked in structure biology lab at iHuman institute. In his free time, he enjoys jogging and swimming.
Fang Ba
Team Member
He's a sophomore studying in School of Life Science and Technology at ShanghaiTech University. He concentrated on molecular cloning of hydrogenase during the summer. What he wants to be in the future is an outstanding principle investigator in the field of biology. His motto is “The choice is more important than efforts.”
Yifei Shen
Team Member
He's a junior student @SIST and a geek by the same time. He took the response of wiki and other programming work in ShanghaitechChina this year. With the experienced skill of computer science, he can do a lot of thing out of imagination.
Lei Zhuang
Team Member
I'm a junior student from the school of life science and technology at Shanghaitech. In our project,  I mainly in charge of purifying hydrogenase and reading papers. Looking back, I really learned a lot, not only about experimental skills but also about cooperation and communication. In one word, iGem taught me how to design and carry out experiments as well as how to be a member of a big team. I really appreciate it.
Weitong Zheng
Team Member
Hello, friends  from IGEM and all over the world. I am Weitong Zheng from IGEM team ShanghaitechChina. I am pound of our team members and our splendid project which will definitely attract you and wish our team members successfully  fulfill our project in the states. Learning amounts of things during IGEM project, not only the experiments skills, but also the attitudes and persistence. What we achieve today is the work based on the whole group's contribution. And for myself introduction, as a third year students in School of Life Science and Technology in ShanghaiTech, I worked for the biofilm culture and characterization, and was responsible for compiling the Notebook of wiki.
Qinying Ye
Team Member
She's a junior student from the School of Life Science and Technology at Shanghaitech. However, she majored in design and illustration in our team. The combination of painting skill and life science knowledge makes her can do our works better.

Haonan Yang
Team Member
15 session undergraduate of SLST, mainly involved in the related experiment of molecular cloning. In addintion, his main research direction is liver damage repairing and liver fibrosis.
Chao Zhong
Team Instructor
Chao Zhong is an assistant professor in materials biology division , School of Physical science and Technology, ShanghaiTech University.  His group does interdisciplinary research at the interface of synthetic biology and materials science. He directed this year's IGEM research.
Wei Shen
Team Instructor
Dr. Shen obtained his bachelor’s degree in biology from Tsinghua University in 2007 and then he pursued his Ph.D in behavioral neuroscience at Johns Hopkins University where he focused on the mechanisms for thermosensation. Soon after he finished his Ph.D in 2013, he went to Rockefeller University as a postdoctoral associate to study the circuits underlying mammalian body temperature regulation and their link to temperature regulation diseases and obesity. Since July 2014, he joined School of Life Science and Technology in Shanghaitech University as an assistant professor (Tenure-track), focusing on study of thermoregulation and feeding behaviors.
Yan Nie
Team Instructor
Yan Nie is our team instructor. he provided us with the help of Acembl system, a well-established multi-expression system. He guided us a lot on molecular clone including the experiment and life.  A lot of appreciate.
