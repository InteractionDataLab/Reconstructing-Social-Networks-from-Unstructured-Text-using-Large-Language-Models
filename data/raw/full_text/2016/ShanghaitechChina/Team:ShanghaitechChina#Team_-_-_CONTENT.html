                        Team Member</P>Shijie Gu is biology lover, willing to explore as much as he can before settling on one specific topic. This year, he joined iGEM at ShanghaiTech as his first try in bioengineering. Although this summer was the first long-period lab commitment for him, he nevertheless quickly absorbed different styles in lab and developed a style of his own. His open as well as a little pushy predisposition also let him bring in different ideas to the host lab of our project, and was regarded as an interesting…funny one. His contribution of the project mainly consists of the cloning of the biofilm section. In addition, his interests in art has greatly contributed to the iGEM project as well, from logo designing to video making.

I am pound of our team members and our splendid project which will definitely attract you and wish our team members successfully  fulfill our project in the states. Learning amounts of things during IGEM project, not only the experiments skills, but also the attitudes and persistence. What we achieve today is the work based on the whole group's contribution. And for myself introduction, as a third year students in School of Life Science and Technology in ShanghaiTech, I worked for the biofilm culture and characterization, and was responsible for compiling the Notebook of wiki.
