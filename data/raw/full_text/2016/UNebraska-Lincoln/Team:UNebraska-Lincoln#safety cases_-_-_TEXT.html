Safety Assurance Cases
A safety case is an architecture to structure the reasoning software engineers use to gain confidence that systems will work as expected. Safety cases are especially developed for safety critical software systems, like software controlling avionics systems or nuclear power plants.
Safety cases are recognized as a powerful tool in software especially in Europe. Safety cases have been used extensively in Europe for over a decade to document safety for safety critical software systems. Predictability of a safety critical software system is essential. By developing safety cases, unexpected defects and vulnerabilities can be uncovered prior to implementation of the software system where failures could lead to devastating consequences.
