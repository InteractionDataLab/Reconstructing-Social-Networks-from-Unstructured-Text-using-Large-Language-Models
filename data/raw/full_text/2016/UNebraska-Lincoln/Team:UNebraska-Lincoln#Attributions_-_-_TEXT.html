We are very thankful for all the help we received throughout our project. Thank you to all who helped with training, resources, public outreach assistance, vector image art, website design, and moral support.
Dr. Jiantao Guo: Associate Professor, acted as an advisor throughout the project, and allowed us to use his lab space, lab resources, and Genehogs cells.
Dr. Wei Niu: Associate Professor, Advised us throughout the project on possible design decisions and different experimental techniques. Contributed the JW2880 strain of E. coli that was integral to our project. Performed the final experiment to test our BioBrick BBa_K2086002 and determine its ability to act as an effective kill-switch by only supporting cell growth when nitrate is present.
Dr. Myra Cohen: Professor, Advised us on project ideas. Gave background information and assistance for developing safety assurance cases.
Dr. Massimiliano Pierobon: Assistant Professor, Advised us on project ideas. Gave instructions and assistance with developing modeling for our project.

Erome Hankor: Graduate Student, Provided wet-lab training and assisted with performing correct lab techniques throughout the project.
Sarah Feit and the Morrill Hall Staff, Assisted in helping our team organize a Building with Biology session at Morrill Hall.
Annie Wood: Design Specialist for the University of Nebraska-Lincoln College of Engineering, Responsible for putting together a brochure that gave details about what our iGEM team did. These brochures were used for promotional material and were also used while trying to get sponsors in order to inform people more about what iGEM is all about.
Special thanks to the iGEM team at Washington University in St. Louis, who advised us, contributed human practice ideas, connected us with sponsors, and provided us with water samples!
The University of Nebraska-Lincoln generously offers the full Adobe Suite to all students. In our project we utilized Adobe Illustrator, as well as a large supply of adobe stock images and vectors in order to help with promotional materials and website design. These stock photos do not require attribution, but we are still very thankful.
Any vector images not provided by the adobe suite were downloaded (with attribution) from FreePik [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11]
