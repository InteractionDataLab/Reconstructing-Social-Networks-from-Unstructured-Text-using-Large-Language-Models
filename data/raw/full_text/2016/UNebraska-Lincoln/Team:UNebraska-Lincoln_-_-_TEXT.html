Knockout Nitrate
A synthetic biology project by the University of Nebraska-Lincoln iGEM Team
Overview
The Nitrogen Cycle is a biogeochemical cycle which has become extremely unbalanced. High nitrate levels in waterways cause drastic effects on the marine life and surrounding environment. To combat this, we set out to engineer an organism capable of reducing these nitrate ions. Throughout our experiments and outreach, we expanded the scope of our project. We developed a nitrate sensitive kill switch, as well as developed safety assurance cases in order to gain confidence in the safety of our system.
As you walk through this wiki, you'll navigate through the drawing board, the laboratory bench, as well as our experiences beyond the bench. Enjoy!
The Drawing Board
The background information, computational modeling, and project design that eventually made its way into our laboratory experiments.
Check out the drawing board!
The Laboratory
Our wet lab experiments, lab notebook procedures, and novel application of safety assurance cases.
Check out the Lab Bench!
Beyond the Bench
Our experiences outside of the lab, from public outreach experiences to inter-team collaboration, we had a blast!
Check out our Meeting Room!
