How to Build a Safety Case
How to Develop a Safety Case:
Developing safety cases can be a daunting task, but it really does not have to be. Safety arguments should be thorough, but by a simple step by step process, clear and thorough safety arguments can be developed and can help guide the design and engineering of the project. Once a team has determined a real world problem to focus on they can begin developing a safety case.
Fundamental Steps to Build a Safety Case:
Identify potential environmental hazards
Design a BioBricks to help solve the problem & engineer them
Toward the end of the design phase, it should be possible to determine specific environmental hazards and the engineered organism’s dependability requirements
As the design evolves, update potential environmental hazards
Understand requirements for reliability of the parts
Obtain evidence to strengthen safety argument claims from wet lab results, previous iGEM results or results in literature
Perform lab simulations and test the system
If refactoring is required to accomplish team goals, refactor the design of the BioBricks as needed and jump to Step 3
Create a clear succinct presentable format for the safety case
A diagram form following Goal Structuring Notation would be appropriate
Evaluate the strength of safety arguments
