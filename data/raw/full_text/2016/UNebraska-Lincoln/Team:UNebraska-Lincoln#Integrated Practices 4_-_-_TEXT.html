Our Safety Case
The safety case we created will ideally serve as a model for other iGEM teams and set the precedent of how safety cases can be used as a safety platform for the iGEM competition. The scope of our safety case is limited to the serA kill switch.
Identified Environmental Hazards:
Bacterial Conjugation
Accidental Release
Natural Migration
Decomposition of biomass from dead E. coli cells
Gene products - serA
Reliability of the BioBricks

Our safety case is not perfect. Realistically no safety case applied to biology really can be. Since the scope of the iGEM project is limited due to time constraints, experimental results that validate the safety of systems in simulated environments may be hard to come by. In software engineering, when safety arguments are not fully developed, it is common practice to indicate this in the diagram with a diamond following any claim that cannot yet be supported with current evidence.
