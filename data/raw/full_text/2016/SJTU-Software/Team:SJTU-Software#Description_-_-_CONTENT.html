What’s more, iGEM organizing committee encourages iGEMers to communicate with more different people. But one of the most common requests we receive from teams is that it’s not easy to contact other teams especially foreign teams, which means people can only rely on e-mails for connection. Though the organizing committee have noticed that and formed a new iGEM phpBB Forum to assist the teams, the inconvenience still exists. In order to solve the problem of most iGEMers, we decided to create a platform on which all iGEMers can contact others and share information more efficiently. In this way iGEM will have its own software for social activities. Besides, we will also add some functions like information releasing from the official committee, literatures sharing through Cloud and laboratories managing. After we complete our work, all iGEMers from now on can use it to assist their journey of iGEM and don’t need to worry about communication anymore.
			</P></DIV><H1>Abstract</H1><DIV id="text_no_picture"><P>We combine characteristics of Synthetic Biology and iGEM, designing a software whose functions cover that of the official website of iGEM, iGEM community, database inquiry, compilation of wiki, communication of teams, distribution of assignments, visualization of experiment consumables, etc. This will considerably promote information exchange between teams, and intelligentize assigning jobs and organize schedules of projects. We classify all the functions mentioned above into two main categories. One is for searching and another is for communicating. For searching: we reorganized the information on iGEM official website and put it all in our software; besides, the iGEM organizing committee has the right to push notifications on it like WeChat. In some way it is a new form of the official website. For communicating: Every team has its own panel and every member also has their own home page. In the team page each team members’ contact information will be shown for convenience of communication. If a team leader wants to contact other teams, he/she can just find them in the Contacts and send them messages directly. There is no need using other social media for contacting and worrying about losing contact with others. Also, it benefits team work (like the function of Teambition). When distributing new tasks, team leaders can do it through our software either.
