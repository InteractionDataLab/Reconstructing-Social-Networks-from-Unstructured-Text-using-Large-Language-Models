Attending SYSU-CCiC
From Sept. 2nd to Sept. 4th, our team members, Yao Jie, Tao Wentao, Cheng Kangzhe and He Chongyu attended Sun Yat-sen University-Central China iGEM Consortium in Guangzhou. During the conference, Yao Jie presented the work of our team and shared ideas with other teams. Apart from us, there was another team working on developing an APP, so we discussed a lot about our progress, project and algorithm. Both of us received some suggestions and advice. Also, other teams’ posters inspired us and offered us more fresh ideas. This conference surely served as a catalyst for developing friendships between teams. It was a good chance to learn from the others.
Popularization of Synthetic Biology in Jingan Community
Human Practice aims at introducing synthetic biology to the public. On Aug. 28, our team members Tao Wentao, Ye Jiannan and Yao Jie went to the community center in Jingan district, Shanghai to do the Human Practice. And Cheng Zhekang designed brochures and He Chongyu designed a poster.
We displayed a board and delivered brochures to nearby residents, including children, seniors and adults. The residents not only received the information on the brochures, but also get detailed and vivid explanation from the team members. Most of them figured out what synthetic biology is about. Some were interested in it and asked several questions about the application of synthetic biology.
Popularization of iGEM and Synthetic Biology in SLSB
On Sept. 21st, we held our Human Practice in the hall of School of Life Science and Biotechnology and Shuhua Lecture Hall. We introduced synthetic biology and iGEM to the students, especially the freshmen. Our teammates Shiyu Fan, Yangzhen Wei, Yuanyuan Xi, Xiangdong Bu, Wentao Tao and Jie Yao attended our activity. We released the information about our activity, which interested students from different schools. At 14:00, we welcomed the students and delivered them our brochures.
At 14:30, we started our presentation, after all the students entered the hall. Our team leader Shiyu Fan introduced details about iGEM software and our team. Yuanyuan Xi shared further information about synthetic biology and iGEM and introduced each track of iGEM. The audience were fully involved. And our presentation received students’ praises. After the meeting, some students had further discussion with our teammates. Our presentation stimulated many student’s curiosity and some of them wanted to take part in the next year’s competition. And the vivid Powerpoint we used illustrated important concepts of synthetic biology, offered them reasonable and further understanding of this advanced subject in sphere of academic.
In order to show more people its charm and to popularize it, we used many ways to introduce synthetic biology to many people who knew little biology or just began to learn biology, just like using analogy to make it easier to understand. Through this activity we also had a better understanding toward what we were doing and the meaning of doing it. On the meeting held by SYSU, we exchanged information to see the development of synthetic biology in China, which might guide our research of next period. Contacting with foreign teams was the most difficult task for us, but it would definitely train our skills in many aspects.
Thanks to many other teams’ feedback, we could improve our software and offer our users better experience. It is not convenient to show all the feedback below, so we will only show some of feedback about every functions.
About Map
1.Can’t find the filter toolbar below.
2.Could not load the page of Map.
3.Some teams have not been listed here.
4.Could not find the Back Button after entering Track.
5.The background color of iGEM’s logo is very similar to the color of the website. If changed, it will be better.
6. Some mosaics are misplaced.
7. The toolbar of setting up position information here may be misunderstood as a search button.(shown on the right)
About Team info
1.End Time must be late than Start Time.
2.Error codes showed up when click the “TEAM” button at the bottom.
About Material
1.It would be better show the type of files and the preview of images. For example, image files can be shown in thumbnails, pdf and doc can be shown in corresponding icons. Then it is more convenient to browse files.
2.It would be better to explain these abbreviation forms in the guide book.(shown on the right)
About Me
1.The typesetting is a little bit disordered. Probably that’s because the input box is far from the title.
About Chat
1.Hope to use customized stickers in Chat page.
2.Sign-up function in Chat was not available.
3.Could not turn to Material page from Chat page.
About Homepage
1.The speed of loading is not fast enough.
2.The animation in main page was really awesome and impressing!
After doing several human practices, we finally understood why we need to do it apart from the competition itself. Through the popularization and the communication, we not only understood synthetic biology better, but also developed friendship with other teams.
