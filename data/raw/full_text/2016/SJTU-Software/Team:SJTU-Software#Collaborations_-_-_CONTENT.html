With the help of our software, they successfully established communication and talked about some academic issues. Second, several teams helped us test our software, did our questionnaires and provided us with feedbacks. </P></DIV><H1> Receive feedbacks from other teams </H1><DIV id="text_no_picture"><P>Thanks to many other teams’ feedback, we could improve our software and offer our users better experience. It is not convenient to show all the feedback below, so we will only show the content of feedback from XMU and NEFU. </P><P>Feedback from NEFU:</P><P> 1.Could not load the page of Map.</P><P> 2.Hope to use customized stickers in Chat page.</P><P> 3.Could not turn to Material page from Chat page.</P><P> 4.It would be better show the type of files and the preview of images. For example, image files can be shown in thumbnails, pdf and doc can be shown in corresponding icons. Then it is more convenient to browse files.</P><P> 5.End Time must be late than Start Time.</P><P> 6.It would be better to explain these abbreviation forms in the guide book.</P><P> 7.Sign-up function in Chat was not available.</P><P>Feedback from XMU:</P><P>About Map：
			1. I can’t find the filter toolbar below.
			2. I think some teams have not been listed here.
			3. Error codes showed up when I clicked the “TEAM” button at the bottom.
			4. After I entered Track, I can’t find the Back Button.
			5. The background color of iGEM’s logo is very similar to the color of the website. If change another one, it will be better.
			6. The word is not aligned here.
			7. Some mosaics are misplaced.
			8. To my understanding, the toolbar of setting up position information here may be misunderstood as a search button.
            About ME:
 			As I see it, the typesetting is a little bit disordered. Probably that’s because the input box is far from the title.
			About Homepage:
			The speed of loading is not fast enough.</P></DIV><P>We felt a sense of achievement when we helped other teams by our own software. And we really appreciated all the help from other teams. Through collaboration, each of us harvested friendships and solved some of our problems.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
