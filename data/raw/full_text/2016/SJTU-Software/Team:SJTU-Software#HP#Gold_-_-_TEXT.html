Survey
Our Human Practices for Gold Medal include the survey we conducted and the collaboration with other teams. We will mainly introduce our Human Practices in the following two parts and demonstrate its positive social influence.
Background
In iGEM China Community, it is very often to see that some students ask for help about how to contact other teams. Indeed, many teams have no idea about how to get in touch with others except e-mails, and so do we. As different teams have their different preference when choosing social software, it is very complicated to get in touch with others. Maybe you like to use Twitter but the team you want to contact like to use Facebook so you definitely can’t find them on Twitter. What’s more, the Chinese government sets the block on Internet, which means we need to unblock it first to use the international resources. As we know, teams from China take a large portion of all. So it’s too complicated for communication.
Our influence in social network
With the help of iMAP, iGEMers can save time and improve their efficiency.
In iMAP, one can simply find the university or school they want to contact. You neither need to go through the team information page on official website, nor to browse some social websites to find the exact information. Saving team members’ time and energy, this software lowers the opportunity cost, thus they can devote more time to the research and experiments.
Also, using the function in Team page, iGEMers can manage their tasks more efficiently.
For example, HZAU wanted to ask UT-Tokyo some questions, yet they found it difficult to find the way to contact them. So they asked us to solve their problem. After we upload the information of UT-Tokyo, they did not have to find the name of University of Tokyo’s iGEM team and go through social networks like Twitter and Facebook, which is fairly time-consuming. Simply by clicking the map, they successfully got in touch with UT-Tokyo.
So take the background information and our example into consideration, it is clear that our software has the comparative advantage, and is a more economic choice for iGEM teams. We believe that our software has a positive social influence, for we not only stimulate the efficiency, but also enhance the communication between teams. And we hope that our software can help more and more iGEMers.
