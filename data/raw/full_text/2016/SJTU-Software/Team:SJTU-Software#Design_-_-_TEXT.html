Overview
Our software named IMAP is a completely new functional software. It contains five parts as Team Map, Materials, Chat, Me and Teams. Except some basic tools of an web application, we use Tencent-IM Server, Google Map API in order to make the server works smoothly. Our software uses Apache and Web.py to return these files to the users.
Frontend
In the front part, we mainly use the JavaScript and PHP language to write a web page, using CSS to control the page layout, to make the display effect of the whole website has a better user experience, the webpage related to the Cookie and local Storage, in order to transfer some important data between pages.
Backend
For the backend, we build a framework of Apache+MySQL+PHP on the server in order to complete our Web App. The main language used in the backend is PHP, it obtain data from the server and returns them to the frontend with JSON format. Because of different developers, a little code like upload was write with Python and Web.py run its server in port 8080. MySQL is mainly used for the storage of usersâ€™ identity information, IGEM participants, team information and other important data.
