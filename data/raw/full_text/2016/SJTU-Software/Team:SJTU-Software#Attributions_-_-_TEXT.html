2015 SJTU-Software
last year’s iGEM team in SJTU, shared their experience and allowed us to put their project – BASE in our software to give more convenience to other teams. Their team leader, Liangjie Liu, told us some difficulties they met last year, and offered advice on our project.
And we are very grateful to all the teams that helped us test the software, gave us feedback and did our survey.
We would like to thank all the people who helped us. It was because of your sincere support that we could achieve all these things.
