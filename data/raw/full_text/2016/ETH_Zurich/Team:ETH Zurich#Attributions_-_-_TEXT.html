ATTRIBUTIONS
In April 2016 a small group of seven motivated students from the fields of Biology, Biochemistry, Biomedical Engineering, Biotechnology and Computational Sciences started their brainstorming sessions to come up with a real-world issue that could be solved by applying the combined know-how. The ETH iGEM team was responsible for almost all of the tasks, including spending long hours on research, managing our team and lab and designing the genetic circuit. Nevertheless, we were grateful to rely on the expertise and knowledge of our Professors, Advisors and others whose contributions are listed here.
ADVISORS
We were lucky to rely on a team of motivated advisors who were always happy to answer questions, double-check our designs or debug our codes.
Claude Lormeau, ETH Zurich, who was always available, even while she was enjoying her holidays.
Daniel Gerngross, ETH Zurich, who patiently helped us measure millions of FACS samples, even if that meant for him to stay late into the night.
Janina Linnik, ETH Zurich, for the reliable late night support on modeling.
Raffaele Altamura, ETH Zurich, who was always able to organize more lab material on short notice when our consumption was higher than expected.
SCIENTIFIC SUPPORT
Within the department as well as outside of it researchers gladly answered our calls for help.
Prof. Sven Panke, Prof. Jörg Stelling, Prof. Yaakov Benenson, ETH Zurich, who helped interpreting our results and guided us through important steps of the project.
Prof. Martin Jinek, University of Zurich, who spared time discussing and evaluating our CRISPR-based system, supplied us with Cpf1 and gRNAs.
Prof. Christophe Lacroix, ETH Zurich, who answered many questions regarding the complex intestinal microbiota.
Prof. Gerhard Rogler, University of Zurich, who discussed with us the important questions on ethics and safety we should examine in our human practices project.
Sabine Österle, ETH Zurich, who supplied us with the EcNR1 strain, pCRISPR and pCas9.
Sarah Guiziou, Université de Montpellier, who sent us the Dual-recombinase-controller plasmid 1 .
Lukas Widmer, ETH Zurich, who introduced us to the secrets of the department's cluster.
Jan Mikelson, ETH Zurich, who provided us with his stochastic parameter estimation tool INSIGHT .
Tsvetan Kardashliev, ETH Zurich, who provided us with sequences and material for directed evolution.
Alexandra Schulz, ETH Zurich, who supplied us with the Keio reference strain E. coli K-12 BW25113 2 .
Verena Jäggin and Telma Lopes, University of Basel, who introduced us to flow cytometry and who optimized its settings for our constructs.
GENERAL SUPPORT
Niels Bürckert who gave us our lab and building safety training.
The BSSE shop team who kindly assisted us with the purchase of the required materials.
Daniel Winkler who took pictures of our team.
