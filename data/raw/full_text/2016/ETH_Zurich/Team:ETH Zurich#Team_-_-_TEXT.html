TEAM
STUDENTS
Tina
Biotechnology
Our wisest member. And the only one that can still be very communicative while being short of sleep.
Asli
Biomedical Engineering
Knows all our plasmid's oris, resistances and content by heart. All 150+ of them. Test her.
Sophie
Biomedical Engineering
When she starts making funny sounds, you know she's running an intense simulation.
Mattia
Computer Science
Insists on making experimentalists running FACS through the night so he can get data the next morning to feed his stochastic models.
Lukas
Biology
Has to run the FACS through the night. Thanks Mattia!
The only bachelor student of our team, but quickly catching up to the Masters.
Andreas
Biotechnology
Currently holding the no sleep record; 40 hours straight at his lab bench. Edit: record beaten the night before wiki freeze.
Lucas
Biochemistry
Leads our Crispr/Cpf1 project. Started late, but seems to be outperforming our main project, soon. Results will be presented in Boston.
