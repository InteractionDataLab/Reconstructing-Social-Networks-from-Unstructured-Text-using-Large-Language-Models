HUMAN PRACTICES - SILVER
Our focus
For the silver medal criteria we focused on four topics:
Safety
Environment
Ethics
Sustainability
Our main method of reaching our target audiences was through education, whether it is about safety and environment;
where we went to the streets of Basel to ask people about their knowledge of the environmental and safety precautions scientists take to make genetically engineered bacteria safe;
or whether we gave a talk at the Basel Science Slam on the ethics of scientific misconduct;
or by participating in a workshop on the Sustainable Development Goals with other youth organizations trying to develop a strategy to educate and motivate the youth in engaging in the SDG's:
Education was on the forefront of our focus.
Not only did we discuss these issues with the general public, but we met with Prof. Rogler to find out what safety and ethical issues are the most pressing and how we can tackle them.
Please take a look at our main human practices page for details on the project an our motivation behind our human practices projects.
Thanks to the sponsors that supported our project:
