Transcriptional regulator esaR
BBa_K2116001
Transcriptional repressor, binds esaboxes.
mNectarine
BBa_K2116016
Red fluorescent protein mNectarine.
mNectarine+ssrA tag
BBa_K2116018
Red fluorescent protein mNectarine with a moderately fast ssrA degradation tag
bxb1 integrase+ssrA
BBa_K2116009
bxb1 integrase with a fast ssrA degradation tag
tp901 integrase+ssrA
BBa_K2116010
Red fluorescent protein mNectarine with a fast ssrA tag
pNorV
BBa_K2116002
Nitric Oxide responsive promoter
superfolder GFP
BBa_K2116017
Fast maturing and stable green fluorescent protein
NO and AHL responsive AND gate
BBa_K2116011
This is an AND gate that is repressed by EsaR and can only be activated by NorR. It requires presence of 3OC6HSL and      nitric oxide for transcription.
bxb1 integrase
BBa_K2116026
bxb1 integrase, can flip any sequence flanked by its attP and attB binding sites.
tp901 integrase
BBa_K2116035
tp901 integrase, can flip any sequence flanked by its attP and attB binding sites.
EsaR regulated promoter
BBa_K2116025
The Bba_J23118 promoter with an additional esabox downstream of transcription start site. Transcription initiation only      in presence of 3OC6HSL .
EsaR regulated promoter
BBa_K2116066
The Bba_J23118 promoter with two esaboxes downstream of transcription start site, separated by an 8bp spacer. Transcription      initiation only in presence of 3OC6HSL .
EsaR regulated promoter
BBa_K2116037
The Bba_J23118 promoter with two esaboxes15bp spacer. Transcription      initiation only in presence of 3OC6HSL .
Lactate regulated AND gate
BBa_K2116027
pNorV promoter flanked with LldR binding sites. Binding site 1 is located upstream of the pNorV promoter and binding site 2 is located after the sigma 45 binding site and before the transcription start site. The promoter will be active when both NO and lactate are present at the same time.
Lactate regulated promoter
BBa_K2116049
Promoter with LldR binding sites on each side and a spacer and J23118 promoter in between. This promoter is intended to mimic BBa_K2116027 without the NO binding function.
NO and AHL regulated AND gate
BBa_K2116004
PnorV promoter with its native spacer after transcription start site, followed by one esabox. This AND gate is active in presence of nitric oxide and the AHL 3OC6HSL .
NO and AHL regulated AND gate
BBa_K2116005
PnorV promoter with its native spacer after transcription start site, followed by two esaboxes 8bp apart. This AND gate is active in presence of nitric oxide and the AHL 3OC6HSL .
NO and AHL regulated AND gate
BBa_K2116006
PnorV promoter with its native spacer after transcription start site, followed by three esaboxes 8bp apart. This AND gate is active in presence of nitric oxide and the AHL 3OC6HSL .
NO and AHL regulated AND gate
BBa_K2116012
PnorV promoter without its native spacer after transcription start site, followed by one esabox. This AND gate is active in presence of nitric oxide and the AHL 3OC6HSL .
NO and AHL regulated AND gate
BBa_K2116013
PnorV promoter without its native spacer after transcription start site, followed by two esaboxes 8bp apart. This AND gate is active in presence of nitric oxide and the AHL 3OC6HSL .
NO and AHL regulated AND gate
BBa_K2116067
PnorV promoter without its native spacer after transcription start site, followed by three esaboxes 8bp apart. This AND gate is active in presence of nitric oxide and the AHL 3OC6HSL .
NO and AHL regulated AND gate
BBa_K2116007
PnorV promoter with its native spacer after transcription start site, followed by two esaboxes 15bp apart. This AND gate is active in presence of nitric oxide and the AHL 3OC6HSL .
NO and AHL regulated AND gate
BBa_K2116008
PnorV promoter with its native spacer after transcription start site, followed by three esaboxes 15bp apart. This AND gate is active in presence of nitric oxide and the AHL 3OC6HSL .
NO and AHL regulated AND gate
BBa_K2116068
PnorV promoter without its native spacer after transcription start site, followed by two esaboxes 15bp apart. This AND gate is active in presence of nitric oxide and the AHL 3OC6HSL .
NO and AHL regulated AND gate
BBa_K2116069
PnorV promoter without its native spacer after transcription start site, followed by three esaboxes 15bp apart. This AND gate is active in presence of nitric oxide and the AHL 3OC6HSL .
