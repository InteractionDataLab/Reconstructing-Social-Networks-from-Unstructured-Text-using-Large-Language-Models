			in E.coli <A href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12529359">[1]</A>. Gene expression can only be activated when NO
			binds the PnorV transcriptional activator NorR.</P><P>Initially we wanted to see how much NorR we would require in order to sense a range of NO from 20-200μM, which is the range
			that is typically seen in IBD <A href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7996962">[2].</A> We <A href="https://2016.igem.org/Team:ETH_Zurich/Sensor_Module">modeled the system</A>			based on parameters found in the literature. Our model suggested that endogenous production of NorR in <I>E.coli</I><A href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2831303/"> [3]</A> is enough for our desired range of sensitivity. Thus
			after successfully cloning the NorV promoter, we tested its activity with the endogenous NorR.
			<A href="http://www.sigmaaldrich.com/catalog/product/sigma/d185?lang=en&amp;region=CH">DETA/NO</A> was used as a source of NO.
			Using our
			<A href="https://2016.igem.org/Team:ETH_Zurich/NO_Release">NO release model</A> for DETA/NO, we could show that the PnorV
			promoter is active within the range of 20-200μM of NO we would like to detect in the gut (Figure 2). </P><DIV class="image_box full_size" style="max-width:500px;"><P><B>Figure 2:</B> PnorV dose response curve for a range of DETA/NO concentrations that corresponds to 7-70μM of NO. Based

				the promoter only in presence of endogenous NorR in <I>E.coli</I>. We can show that the activity range of the promoter
				is within the 20-200μM range that corresponds to inflammation in the gut

			4). An esabox is a 18bp sequence where EsaR can bind. Unlike other quorum sensing regulators EsaR acts as a transcriptional
			repressor and not an activator.</P><P>In order to characterise repression efficiency of EsaR, we placed esaboxes after a constitutive promoter<A href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_J23118"> (BBa_J23118).</A>(Figure
			5) During dose response tests we discovered that EsaR system displays non-sigmoidal dose response. With the intermediate
			AHL concentrations we tested, there's a dip in the dose response curve (Figure 6). This corresponds to concentrations
			close to the saturation point of the dose response. Our <A href="https://2016.igem.org/Team:ETH_Zurich/Sensor_Module">AHL sensor model</A>			could later explain the reason behind this behaviour. </P><P>Based on this insight from the model, we changed the amount of EsaR we express inside the cell to reduce the dip in the
			dose response curve. Our strategy was to put two copies of EsaR under individual constitutive promoters(
			<A href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_J23118"> BBa_J23118</A>; expressing EsaR on a low copy plasmid instead of the initial

            (BBa_J23102).</A> In the end we obtained the best results with increasing EsaR expression through the stronger
			constitutive promoter <A href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_J23102">
            (BBa_J23102)</A>. Even though we cannot obtain fully sigmoidal behaviour, we managed to reduce the effect of
			this phenomenon on the EsaR dose response. (Compare Figure 5 and 6). Consequently we decided to use this construct for

From the <A href="https://2016.igem.org/Team:ETH_Zurich/Switch_Module#tuning"> model of the switch</A> we know that low leakiness of the AND gate is crucial in order to ensure reliability of the stored information, thus the best AND gates are the ones that exhibit the highes fold-change activation. Following these indications, after characterizing our collection we decided to use the AND gate seen in Figure 5, since it showed the highest fold activation (Figure 9).</P><DIV class="image_box full_size" style="max-width:400px;"><P><B>Figure 9:</B> The AND gate we selected to use for our complete system displays 4-fold activation and low leakiness,

			circuit gets its flexibility from. This was an important motivation behind choosing an activator system for the NO part,
			and a repressor system for the AHL part of our AND gate. In order to demonstrate this flexibility, we exchanged the esaboxes
			with the lldO operators, allowing us to create an AND gate responsive to lactate and NO (Figure 7).</P><DIV class="image_box full_size" style="max-width:400px;"><P><B>Figure 9:</B> An alternative AND gate responsive to NO and lactate.

		by attP and attB parts it recognises <A href="">(Bba_).</A> After flipping the promoter no longer faces mNectarine, but now
		faces the gfp.<P>We cloned two recombinases, bxb1<A href="">(Bba_)</A> and tp901<A href="">(Bba_)</A> under the Ptet promoter. Since recombinase
			flipping is irreversible, our initial aim was to avoid leakiness as much as possible. Hence the recombinases were designed

Even when we removed the degradation tag the flipping was too weak.</P><P>We decided to use the model to <A href="https://2016.igem.org/Team:ETH_Zurich/Switch_Module#tuning">tune</A> the switch precisely. Performing a sensitivity analysis on the parameters of the switch, we identified integrase degradation rate and RBS strength as the key tunable parameters of the switch. Moreover we discovered that in order for the switch to work optimally, these parameters must have a specific ratio. Based on this input we designed a stronger RBS.</P><P>Under advice from the <A href="https://2016.igem.org/Team:ETH_Zurich/Detector_Module#results">model</A> we also decreased the repression of Ptet promoter by expressing TetR on a low copy plasmid rather than a medium one. These improvements resulted in significant improvement of the switch. We can now show that flipping at 8hours is 2-fold higher compared to before (Figure 11.) In addition, the flipping kinetics satisfy the <A href="https://2016.igem.org/Team:ETH_Zurich/Switch_Module#tuning">requirements</A> defined by the model almost perfectly.</P><DIV class="image_box" style="max-width:400px;"><P><B>Figure 10:</B> Bxb1 activity, measured as efficiency of flipping. When a directional promoter is flipped by bxb1, gfp
				is expressed. Here we show that a stronger RBS results in only ~6-fold less flipping over 8 hours, compared to the control.
				This is at least a 2-fold improvement of the flipping kinetics. Our control is 48hours of flipping by constitutively
				expressed bxb1. Data was generated through flow cytometry analysis. The error bars indicate SEM. </P></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="sec light_grey"><H2> CONCLUSION AND OUTLOOK
