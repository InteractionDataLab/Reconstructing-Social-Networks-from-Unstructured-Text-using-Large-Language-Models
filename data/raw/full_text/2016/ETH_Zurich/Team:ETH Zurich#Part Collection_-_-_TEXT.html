OVERVIEW
Our associative learning circuit requires a sensor that can detect simultaneously occuring signals, in this case nitric     oxide and AHL (Figure 1). Such a sensor with these specific inputs has not been described in the literature before. Thus     we generated a collection of AND gates responsive to NO and AHL in order to find a design that best fits the requirements     of our system.
We also wanted to demonstrate the flexibility of our system and created one more AND gate responsive to lactate and NO.     The lactate portion of the AND gate was based on the work done by ETH Zurich 2015 team.
Figure 1: The learning circuit requires simultaneous detection of nitric oxide and AHL. We designed a collection      of AND gates for this purpose, using a combination of the NorV promoter and esaboxes.
Components of the AHL-based AND gate
NorV promoter (PnorV) is the native promoter controlling the nitric oxide reduction operon (norRVW) in E. Coli. [1]. It's transcriptional regulator,     NorR, can bind nitric oxide and activate gene expression. We used this promoter in combination with basal NorR production     in E.coli as the Nitric Oxide (NO) sensor of our AND gate. The PnorV promoter can also be found among the biobricks     we submitted to the registry Part:BBa_K2116002.
EsaR (Part:BBa_K2116001) is a transcriptional regulator     of the Pantoea stewartii quorum sensing system [2]. In the abscence of 3OC6HSL it can bind DNA and inhibit transcription. An esabox is a 18bp sequence where EsaR can bind. Unlike other quorum sensing regulators EsaR acts as a transcriptional     repressor and not an activator. We took advantage of this property, and placed esaboxes either;
i) as roadblocks after transcription start site of PnorV, preventing the polymerase from advancing or;
ii) within the PnorV to establish competitive binding between NorR and EsaR or RNA polymerase and EsaR.
Design Considerations
i) Roadblock AND Gates
This collection of AND gates each have either one, two or three esaboxes placed as roadblock. Since more than one EsaR     binding close to each other could create steric hindrance, we constructed variants where the spacing between the esaboxes     is either 8bp or 15bp.

ii) Competitive Binding and/or Roadblock AND Gates
Here our aim was to prevent either NorR or the sigma54 factor of RNA polymerase from binding the promoter. There are 3     NorR binding sites, and one sigma54 binding site on the NorV promoter (Figure 2). We placed esaboxes either right before     the sigma54 binding site, as a replacement for part of the sigma54 binding site, or upstream of one of the NorR binding     sites. For one of these designs, we also have a variant where an additional esabox is placed as a roadblock. This was     designed as a solution to potential problems with leakiness of the AND gate.

One esabox before NorR binding site 3, and one as a roadblock after the transcription start site. This is our favourite AND gate
BBa_K2116038
Unfortunately, placing an esabox before the polymerase binding site lead to a loss of function in the AND gate

Lactate-based AND gate
The lactate and NO AND gate was designed to demonstrate the potential multiplexing power of our circuit. Unlike AHL, which is quorum sensing molecule, lactate is an intermediate metabolite of microbial metabolism. To detect lactate, we used the LldR repressor. In the absence of lactate LldR binds to the two LldR-binding sites and represses the transcription through looping of the DNA between the two binding sites. To get a promoter with an AND gate logic, we placed a pNorV promoter between the two LldR binding sites.

Promoter displays an AND gate logic. The induction rate is 1.5.
Model
In order to match the experiments, we modelled independantly The EsaR interaction system, and the NorR systems. This way we could easily tuned the two facets of the AND Gate sensor module so that it matches the system sensing requirements. Later on, we combined those two independant modules together to model the complete AND Gate behavior.
PnorV is a looping promoter, which allows NorR to come in contact with the RNA polymerase. Transcription is initiated     once NO binds and NorR is active. [3] The initial results showed that the AND gate was repressed by EsaR, but could not     be fully induced. Our first hypothesis was that looping prevents EsaR from unbinding. However, further analysis of the EsaR system alone tend to show that two species $DEsaR_{AHL}$ and $AHL$ compete to disable/enable the promoter for transcription. Thus the system dose response does not display a monotonal behavior. On the contrary, the rate of freed promoter srongly depends on the $DEsaR_{AHL}$ / $AHL$ ratio, and displays an unexpected not so repressive behavior for a specific range of EsaR production rate.
Nevertheless, a careful analysis of the system based on estimated paramters from the data, demonstrate that this EsaR repression problem can be solved by changing the constitutive promoter preceding the EsaR gene.
For further details, do not hesitate to consults our AHL sensor model page .
Conclusion
After careful evaluation, we picked one variant to be the main AND gate of our system. After tuning the EsaR concentration, this AND gate demonstrated the                 best behaviour within the range of AHL and NO concentrations we wanted to detect. Below you can see a surface plot (Figure 6) generated through experimental data (black dots) and interpolation (surface). This describes the AND gate behaviour before tuning EsaR concentrations. Figure 7 shows that after tuning the AND gate responds to ranges indicated by the white dashes on the surface plot (Figure 6), which marks the desired area.
We have a collection of AND gates characterised experimentally and with a detailed model that could be used by future     iGEM teams.
