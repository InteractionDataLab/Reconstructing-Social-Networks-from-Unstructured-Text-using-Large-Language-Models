♦Enzyme Kinetics of FAME Production with SAM as a Constant♦
The theoretical output of the production of fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) was modeled by means of the Michaelis Menten equation using the starting concentrations of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) , 0.2 mM, Drosophila melanogaster juvenile hormone acid O-methyltransferase (DmJHAMT), 6.14 mM and lauric acid (FFAs), 7.38 mM (Sherkhanov et al, 2016 ). SAM is fixed as a constant because it is assumed to be replenished within the cell. The Km and Vmax were also obtained from the Sherkhanov et al article.
