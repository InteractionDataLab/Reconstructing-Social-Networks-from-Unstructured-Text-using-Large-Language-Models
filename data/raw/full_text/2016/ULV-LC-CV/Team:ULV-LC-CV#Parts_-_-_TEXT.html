♦K2007000♦
Constitutive promote expressing GFP and Lac promoter expressing FadR gene
This is a circuit which expresses GFP under a constitutive promoter. It also expresses FadR under the Lac promoter.
♦K2007001♦
pLR promoter expressing GFP and Lac promoter expressing FadR gene
This is a circuit which expresses GFP in a fatty acid concentration dependent manner. It also expresses FadR under the Lac promoter.
♦K2007005♦
Constitutive promoter expressing DmJHAMT and GFP, Lac promoter expressing FadR
This circuit expresses GFP and a Drosophila melanogaster Juvenile Hormone Acid O-methyltransferase (DmJHAMT) under a constitutive promoter. It also expresses FadR under the Lac promoter.
♦K2007006♦
pLR promoter expressing DmJHAMT and GFP, Lac promoter expressing FadR
This circuit expresses GFP and a Drosophila melanogaster Juvenile Hormone Acid O-methyltransferase (DmJHAMT) under a fatty acid concentration dependent manner. It also expresses FadR under the Lac promoter.
