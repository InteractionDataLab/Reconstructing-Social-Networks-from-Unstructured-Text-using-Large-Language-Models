Day1: 2016/07/18
Investigator(s): Lisa Verbeij, Lucie Delfos
Procedure :
Cell measurement protocol
Transformed E. coli DH5alpha with the plasmids: - Positive control - Negative control - Device 1: J23101+I13504 - Device 2: J23106+I13504 - Device 3: J23117+I13504
No plasmids were present in the tubes we obtained for the interlab study.
Therefore 10microliter of milliQ was added to the tubes.
Mixed with vortex and spinned down.
50microliters competent cells (red spot) + 10 microliters of the milliQ with plasmids was added.
30 minutes incubation on ice.
Heatshock 42 &degC; 30 sec 1mL LB was added
Shaking at 37 &degC; 1 hour 100 microliter and 500 microliter on plates
Day2: 2016/07/19
Investigator(s): Lisa Verbeij, Lucie Delfos
Results :
Cell measurement protocol No colonies were visible. We will perform this again when we have good plasmids.
Calibration protocols 1. OD600 Reference point
100microliter LUDOX into wells A1, B1, C1, D1
100microliter h2o into A2, B2, C2, D2
Measured absorbance at 595 (+- 10)nm (10.26 measured with a plate reader)
2.Protocol FITC fluorescence standard curve
Spinned down FITC stock tube
Added 1mL 1xPBS to this FITC tube
Incubated 42degrees for 4 hours
Made a dilution series starting with 200 microliters FITC 5x stock (2.5microM) constantly diluting it twice in 1xPBS and ending with 100 microliters 1xPBS.
This was performed 4 times
The fluorescence of GFP was measured with a plate reader.
