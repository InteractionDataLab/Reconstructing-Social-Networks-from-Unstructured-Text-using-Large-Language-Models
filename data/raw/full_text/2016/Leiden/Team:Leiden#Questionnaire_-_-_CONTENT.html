      Introduction
     </H3><P>
      What do people think about iGEM? Or synthetic biology? And what if we mention GMOs? In order to enthuse others for iGEM, without scaring them of genetic manipulation, we have to assess the public opinion on synthetic biology. To this end, we performed a survey that would pose questions about the various aspects of this research area, including: medical, agricultural and sustainable fuel applications.
     </P><P>
      Proper study design requires us to first evaluate the effectiveness of our survey in answering our research question on a small group: a pilot study. Therefore, we handed out our survey at the Museumnacht, about which you can read more here:

      Results
     </H3><P>
      In the pilot study, we found that opinions on synthetic biology depend on the intended application. While most people strongly support the use of synthetic biology for medical and biofuel applications, opinions on its use in agriculture were more varied. Nevertheless, the practical examples of applications were all received positively by most interviewees.
     </P><P>
      Our pilot also showed a trend towards a slightly more positive view on synthetic biology by male interviewees. No trend was observed for different age groups or level of education. However, the number of observations in the pilot study was small (n=22), so perhaps the actual survey will reveal significant differences.
