The promoter was maximally induced under microaerobic conditions (dissolved oxygen levels of less than 2% air saturation). Transcriptional activity decreased substantially under anaerobic conditions, suggesting the presence of a regulatory mechanism that is maximally induced under hypoxic but not completely anaerobic conditions in E.coli. Primer extension analysis was used to identify the existence of two overlapping promoterswithin a 150-base-pair region upstream of the structural VHb gene. The oxygen-dependent activity of both promoters was qualitatively similar, suggesting the existence of a common mechanism by which available oxygen concentrations influence expression from the two promoters.

Deinococcus radiodurans is an extremely radiation-resistant bacterium: while about 10 Gy (absorbed radiation dose, Gray) can kill most vertebrates, D. radiodurans can withstand up to 12,000 Gy. Current literature supports this finding with D. radioduransâ€™ unique genetic makeup which allows it to better handle radiation exposure. The two main effects of radiation exposure to bacterial cells are DNA damage and the creation of toxic superoxide species (Daly 2009). Two DNA damage prevention and repair proteins in D. radiodurans have been shown to outperform analogs in less radiation-tolerant bacteria. By binding to DNA, the protein DpsMP1 (DNA-binding proteins from starved cells) protects it from the reactive superoxide species formed by ionizing radiation (Slade and Miroslav 2011).

Promoter (lacI regulated, lambda pL hybrid). Inverting regulatory region controlled by LacI (BBa_C0010, BBa_C0012, etc.) The PLlac 0-1 promoter is a hybrid regulatory region consisting of the promoter P(L) of phage lambda with the cI binding sites replaced with lacO1. The hybrid design allows for strong promotion that can nevertheless be: (1) repressed by LacI, the Lac inhibitor (i.e. repressor) (BBa_C0012) ([LUTZ97]); (2) induced by IPTG in E.Coli DH5-alpha-Z1 (same paper reference) over a >600-fold range.

araC-Pbad - Arabinose inducible regulatory promoter/repressor unit.This part contains the promoter as well as the coding sequence for the repressor AraC which is transcribed in the opposite direction. (upstream) By binding to L(+)-arabinose, AraC changes its conformation. This causes the protein to diffuses from the DNA thereby inducing transcription.
