Thanks!
We would like to thank all our sponsors & partners for making this project possible. In particular we would like to thank IDT, Leiden University and BaseClear for their generous support. Furthermore, we would like to thank Airbus Space and Defence Netherlands for their generous contribution to the Random Positioning Machine (RPM).
Integrated DNA technologies
Integrated DNA technologies is a main supllier of oligonucleotiden for the research and life sciences market. Oligonucleotides are short strands of DNA that can be synthesized. This synthesized DNA is comparable to oligonucleotides existing in nature and can have various apllications in synthetic biology e.g. PCR.
Airbus Defence and Space Netherlands
Airbus Defence and Space Netherlands delivers various products, including satellite instruments and launch rocket structures. Their products also include a random positioning machine (RPM). The RPM is capable of simulating micro-gravity, making it possible to simulate gravity on different planets. Thereby this machine can be used in different scientific disciplinces, including biology.
Leiden University
The university of Leiden is an international orientated university with a broad range of study programmes, ranging from biology to Japanese literature. Furthermore, Leiden University is the oldest university in the Netherlands with notable alumni, including the current king of the Netherlands.
BaseClear
BaseClear was founded in 1993 by the Dutch biologists Reichert and Barel. The company is able to sequence and synthesize DNA. Enzymes can be made and are applied in different industries as biofuel or in detergents.
