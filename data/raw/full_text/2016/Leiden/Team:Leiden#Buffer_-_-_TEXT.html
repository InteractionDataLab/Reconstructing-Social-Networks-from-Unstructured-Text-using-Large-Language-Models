List of Media
LB medium (Lysogeny Broth)
Nutrient rich medium, used for liquid or solid culturing of bacteria.
Ingredients
LB Broth, Sigma Aldrich
Demi water
Agar, Sigma Aldrich (for solid medium)
Antibiotics (optional)
Preperation
LB Broth is needed in a concentration of 15,5 g/L demiwater.
For 400 mL, this is 6.2 g LB Broth.
For 200 mL, this is 3.1 g LB Broth.
For plates, add agar in a concentration of 1.5% w/v.
For 400 mL, this is 6 g agar.
For 200 mL, this is 3 g agar.
Add demi water till the final volume is reached. Shake thorougly.
Autoclave for (at least) 15 minutes at 121&degC.; Remember to unscrew the lid one turn!
Store at room temperature or, for solid medium sometimes preferable, 60&degC.;
Antibiotics can be added to the medium prior to use. Always add these after heating/when the medium has cooled down enough so you can touch it (around 50&degC;) to avoid breakdown of the antibiotic!

Plasmid DNA isolation Solution 1 - Tris-HCl EDTA
This solution deactivates enzymes released in the process of cell lysis by chelating divalent cations needed for these reactions. RNase can be added (recommended!) to digest the released RNA, that would otherwise be isolated together with the plasmid.
Composition: 25mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10mM EDTA. Optional: 100 µg/ml RNase A
Ingredients:
Tris (s), GE Healthcare Tris PlusOne
11.8M HCl (l), Sigma Aldrich
Demi water
EDTA (l), pH 8.0
RNase A (optional)
Preperation
This solution is composed of equal amounts of 0.05M Tris-HCl and 0.02M EDTA
For 100 mL 0.05M Tris-HCl pH 8.0: (Source: GE Healthcare)
25 mL 0.2M Tris
13,4 mL 0.2M HCl
Add to demi water to a final volume of 100 mL (app. 62.6 mL)
OR, if you don't have these solutions readily available:
Take ca. 80 mL of demiwater
Dissolve 0.6057g Tris (MW 121.14)
Add 0.2271 mL stock HCl (~11.8M)
Measure pH and correct this to a pH of 8.0
Add demi water to a final volume of 100 mL
For 20 mL of 20 mM EDTA, pH 8.0
Weigh 0.1169g EDTA (MW 292.24)
Add demi water to a volume of app. 14 mL
Measure pH and add NaOH till a pH of 8.0 is reached
Add demi water to a final volume of 20 mL
Mix 20 mL 0.05M Tris-HCl pH 8.0 with 20 mL 0.02M EDTA pH 8.0. Add RNase to a final concentration of 100 µg/ml RNase A.
Plasmid DNA isolation Solution 2 - NaOH SDS
This solution is responsible for alkaline lysis of the bacterial cells and denaturation of all proteins.
Composition: 0.2M NaOH, 1.0% SDS
Since SDS may precipitate after a couple of days, it is recommended to only mix these solutions prior to use.
Ingredients:
NaOH
Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate (SDS)
Demi water
Preparation
Depending on the stock concentrations.
Plasmid DNA isolation Solution 3 - KOAc
This solution neutralizes the pH of the acidic mixture, which makes everything except for the plasmid DNA (and possibly RNA) precipitate, forming a white slurry.
Composition: 3M KOAc, pH 4.8
Since SDS may precipitate after a couple of days, it is recommended to only mix these solutions prior to use.
Ingredients:
KOAc (s)
Acetic Acid stock solution
Demi water
Preparation
For 30 mL of solution 3:
Weigh 8.834g KOAc (MW 98.15)
Add app. 10 mL of demi water
Measure pH and add acetic acid till the pH reaches 4.8
Add demi water to a final volume of 30 mL
