       Our team&quot;s
            goal is to develop an organism that is capable of degrading a toxic compound,
            which is primarily highly abundant in Martian soil. Up to one percent of the
            Martian soil contains
       <I>
        perchlorate
       </I>
       , a toxic compound that inhibits
            Thyroid activity in humans. Crops to be grown on Martian soil will accumulate
            perchlorate, rendering sustainable colonization of Mars impossible. NASA is
            aware of this issue. They have hosted a conference about the presence of
            perchlorate, and have begged scientists to find a solution for it.

       In 2025,
            humans will land on Mars for the first time. Considering the toxicity of Mars&quot; soil,
            these humans will need to be supplied externally. One option is to periodically
            send spacecrafts carrying food to Mars. Such a journey
            takes a spacecraft 150-300 days

            $500M.

       These
            travelling times and costs might decrease in the future, due to scientific
            improvements, as well as the competition between privately-held space-travel
            companies. Even so, for a sustainable habitation on Mars, certain supplies
            would have to be produced on Mars. Water can be recycled, but food cannot. As
            such, substances that can produce reasonable amounts of food, and are
            unchallenging to transport have to be used. The most logical solution is the
            cultivation of plants. A seed is easy to carry in a spacecraft, and the soil it
            can grow in is already on Mars. Scientist from Wageningen University have
            already demonstrated that Martian soil contains enough nutrients for plants to
            grow. They used Martian soil simulant -that does not contain perchlorate- for
            their experiments. The conclusion is that Mars-grown vegetables are edible, if
            one removes the perchlorate they contain. This gives us our target product: a
            (biological) device that is able to break down not just filter- perchlorate on
            Mars.

       Whilst
            perchlorate&quot;s presence on earth is a problem, it is a barrier to our existence
            on Mars. Perchlorate accumulates easily in plants. In research mentioned
            before, 79 % of all perchlorate in solution ended up in plants tissue. This
            makes any plant grown on Mars inedible. This is the case, supposing that plants
            are even able to grow in such high perchlorate concentrations. Out of all
            Martian soil, 0.5-1% is perchlorate. This is in mass percentages, meaning that
            1 kg of Martian soil contains up to 10 g perchlorate. When dissolved in water,
            the perchlorate dissolves. Perchlorate salts generally have high solubility.
            The perchlorate with the smallest solubility is potassium perchlorate (KClO4-).
            At the most, one can dissolve 15 g of potassium perchlorate per liter of water.
            One can, however, dissolve up to 2kg of sodium perchlorate per liter. So,
            consider moist Martian soil. The water in the soil now has a concentration of
            perchlorate ranging from 0.11-16.1 mol/L. Honghzi He et al. have tested plant
            growth at various perchlorate concentrations.

       The highest
            concentration was 500 mg/L, this is a factor 30 lower than the lowest
            concentration found on Mars. At these concentrations, plant growth is already
            significantly decreased. The plant,
       <I>
        C. indica
       </I>
       only grew up to 68% of its
            natural height at 500 mg/L. This means that farming for food in Mars is not
            viable, unless the perchlorate is reduced.

       The question
            is, what kind of vegetables should one grow for survival on Mars? Researchers
            from Wageningen University have found that the following plants grow best on
            Mars: tomatoes, Mustard, stonecrop, cress and wheat. Unfortunately, these are
            not the most efficient plants.

       Rice, for
            example, is a very nutritious crop, but it requires a lot of water. In
            addition, one can only harvest it yearly. These two conditions make it
            unsuitable for Mars.
      </SPAN></P><P class="Body" style="tab-stops:35.4pt 70.8pt 106.2pt 141.6pt 177.0pt 212.4pt 247.8pt 283.2pt 318.6pt 354.0pt 389.4pt 424.8pt 460.2pt"><SPAN lang="EN-US" style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;">
       Another
            promising crop is the tepary bean. This bean requires very little water. It has
            4 calories per gram. Additionally, it can be harvested every 60 days.
            Unfortunately, this crop only yields 0.0645 kg/m2.

       The sand can
            be used immediately, because the perchlorate is taken into the bioreactor. This
            way, one can already arrange the purified sand, whilst the perchlorate is being
            broken down. We place a water-proof canvas on the area we intend to use for
            farming. All the purified sand is place here. This way, we can easily isolate
            the pure sand from the perchlorate-contaminated sand. If we water this purified
            soil, it cannot drain down into the soil, due to the canvas.

       Our technique
            has a huge advantage when compared to using filters or reverse osmosis; the
            perchlorate is broken down. The perchlorate is not moved anywhere, it is reduced
            into oxygen and chloride. The oxygen is then pumped away, the chloride is
            precipitated.

       We send an Eppendorf tube containing our

            that it takes significantly less weight than an ion exchange system. Sending

            can easily get the components on Mars.

       Due to the fact that the bacterium utilises the
            energy released by breaking down perchlorate, an explosion is impossible. In
            aerospace engineering, any risk should be avoided. Conversations with Airbus
            Defence and Space, as well as the European Space Agency and Interstellar Space
            in Leiden have informed us about the demands of spacecrafts. In coordination
            with their requirements, we have designed a system that is able to meet the
            high standard of safety and reliability required in space.

       Before we are
            able to send our bacterium to Mars, we need to make a proof of principle on
            Earth. If we can demonstrate that we are able to solve perchlorate-related
            issues on Earth, space agencies will be convinced about our potential on Mars.
            In The Netherlands, there is a lot of interest for the application of space
            technology on Earth. This process is called &quot;downstream technology&quot;. An example
            is using spectrometers found in satellites to detect whether vegetables are
            ripe. During a meeting with the ESA Business Incubator, they were in ecstasy
            about the potential our system has for downstream technology. They have invited
            us to continue our project -in the shape of a company- in their business incubation
            track. The Leiden Bio Science Park has also invited us to participate in such a
            track. As of now, we are considering what would the best choice. The Science
            Park has a lot more support for life science companies, while the ESA knows a
            lot more about aerospace engineering. Besides these partners, a local venture
            capital firm called &quot;Innovation Quarter&quot; wants us to pitch for investors to
            qualify for investments. These are not even the most exciting negotiations we&quot;ve
            had. On September 29th, we&quot;ve pitched our business case for a large group of
            Russian, Japanese, American and Chinese investors. That week, there was a forum
            for large-scale investments in The Netherlands. For more information, see the

       We were able
            to attract this much attention for our project, because we&quot;ve identified clear
            niches in which our product would be able to easily outperform existing
            technologies. We would love to give clear examples about these niches, but that
            is not yet possible. Due to negotiations with ESA and an associate from
            McKinsey, we are not able to disclose this information at this point. By the
