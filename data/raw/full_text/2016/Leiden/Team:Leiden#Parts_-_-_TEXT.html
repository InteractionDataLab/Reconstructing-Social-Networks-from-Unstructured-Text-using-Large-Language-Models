Figure 1. The perchlorate reduction biobrick. This scheme illustrates the genetic composition of our goal: The perchlorate reduction biobrick. Individual genetic elements are elaborated below.
Figure 2. The perchlorate reduction proteins locations in the cell and their function. Molybdenum cofactor (Moco) is built in PcrA and transported via the Tat secretion system into the periplasm together with PcrD, which acts as a chaperone. PcrAB, the catalytic domain of PcrABC, is able to convert perchlorate into chlorate and chlorate into chlorite. Chlorite dismutase (Cld) is able to break chlorite down into chloride and oxygen ions.
PcrA
Perchlorate reductase subunit alpha. 1 Component of the perchlorate reductase that catalyzes the reduction of perchlorate to chlorite. Is probably also able to reduce chlorate to chlorite. The alpha subunit is likely the catalytic subunit.
PcrB
Perchlorate reductase subunit beta (Perchlorate reductase iron-sulfur subunit). 1 Component of the perchlorate reductase that catalyzes the reduction of perchlorate to chlorite. The beta subunit may be responsible for electron transfer to the catalytic alpha subunit PcrA. It is probably translocated together with PcrA, which possesses a Tat-type signal.
PcrC
Perchlorate reductase subunit gamma (Perchlorate reductase heme subunit). 1 Component of the perchlorate reductase that catalyzes the reduction of perchlorate to chlorite. The gamma subunit may be responsible for electron transfer to the beta subunit PcrB.
PcrD
Perchlorate reductase assembly chaperone protein. 1 May function as a system-specific molybdenum chaperone protein essential for the assembly of the perchlorate reductase PcrAB complex prior to its periplasmic translocation via the Tat pathway.
Chlorite dismutase
Catalyzes the heme-dependent decomposition of chlorite to O2 and chloride with high efficiency and specificity. 2 Used to detoxify chlorite, a by-product of the reduction of perchlorate, a primarily anthropogenic pollutant, in perchlorate-respiring bacteria.
MoaA
Catalyzes, together with MoaC, the conversion of 5'-GTP to cyclic pyranopterin monophosphate (cPMP or molybdopterin precursor Z). 2
Qdh-dhc
Quinol dehydrogenase tetra-heme cytochrome and di-heme c-type cytochrome. 2
