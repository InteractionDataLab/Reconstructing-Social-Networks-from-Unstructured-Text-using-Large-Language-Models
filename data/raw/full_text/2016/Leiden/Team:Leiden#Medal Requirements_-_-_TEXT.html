Medal Requirements
Bronze medal requirements
(Register)Register the team
(Judging form)Complete the judging form
(Attend) Attend the Giant jamboree
(Deliverables) Check in of special chassin organisms
Safety check (Lab, project final safety form)
Present project by poster
Document the project on the Team Wiki Page
Create a page on your team wiki with clear attribution of each aspect of your project https://2016.igem.org/Team:Leiden/Attributions
Create and document Part pages on the Registry for the Parts made https://2016.igem.org/Team:Leiden/Parts
(Sample submission)Submit DNA samples of your new Parts to the Registry.
(Part/Contribution)Document at least one new standard BioBrick Part or Device central to your project and submit this part to the iGEM Registry (submissions must adhere to the iGEM Registry guidelines)
Silver medal requirements
Experimentally validate that at least one new BioBrick Part or Device of your own design and construction works as expected. Document the characterization of this part in the Main Page section of that Part’s/Device’s Registry entry.
Convince the judges you have helped any registered iGEM team from high school, a different track, another university, or another institution in a significant way by. https://2016.igem.org/Team:Leiden/Collaborations
iGEM projects involve important questions beyond the lab bench, for example relating to (but not limited to) ethics, sustainability, social justice, safety, security, and intellectual property rights. Demonstrate how your team has identified, investigated, and addressed one or more of these issues in the context of your project. < https://2016.igem.org/Team:Leiden/HP/Silver
Gold medal requirements
Expand on your silver medal activity by demonstrating how you have integrated the investigated issues into the design and/or execution of your project. https://2016.igem.org/Team:Leiden/HP/Gold
Improve the function OR characterization of an existing BioBrick Part or Device and enter this information in the Registry. Please see the Registry help page on how to document a contribution to an existing part. This part must NOT be from your 2016 part number range. https://2016.igem.org/Team:Leiden/Description
Demonstrate a functional proof of concept of your project. Your proof of concept must consist of a BioBrick device; a single BioBrick part cannot constitute a proof of concept.(biological materials may not be taken outside the lab). https://2016.igem.org/Team:Leiden/Proof
Show your project working under real-world conditions. To achieve this criterion, you should demonstrate your whole system, or a functional proof of concept working under simulated conditions in the lab (biological materials may not be taken outside the lab). https://2016.igem.org/Team:Leiden/Demonstrate
