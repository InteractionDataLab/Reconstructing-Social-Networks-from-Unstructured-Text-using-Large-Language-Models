About Our Lab
We had the opportunity to use the lab spaces in the Sylvius Laboratory Building, which is part of Leiden University. Normally, these labs are used for educational purposes, crowding the spaces with around 100 hardworking students. However, during the course of the summer our team quite literally colonized the lab benches. Almost every day of the week we started the day with a group meeting to keep everyone up to date. After which everyone would go to work, until we came back together for lunch. Here, we all got the chance to show our geeky side while we played all sorts of games, the best way to keep the team spirit high. Our most favorite game was codenames, but also werewolves scored high.
For some the lab space became somewhat a little bit like a second home, having their personal post being delivered at the University Building. Having to leave at the end of the summer was sad, but we gained a lot of memories and experiences in the lab and are very grateful to get the chance to work here.
