Gold Medal
1. Integrated Human Practices
Expand on your silver medal activity by demonstrating how you have integrated the investigated issues into the design and/or execution of your project.(See more in the HP/Gold .)
Integrated human practices were well-tailored for the development of our project. We created a series of study to further discover the quality and practicality of our project. In the investigative study, we met up with people from different backgrounds including agricultural academics, farmers, proprietors, and potential users. Therefore, we can integrate the opinions and advices into the project.
For implementing our project in the real farmland, we started up entrepreneurship to commercialize our system. We participated various business plan contests to bring our project to the society.
2.Improve a previous part or project
Improve the function OR characterization of an existing BioBrick Part or Device and enter this information in the Registry. Please see the Registry help page on how to document a contribution to an existing part. This part must NOT be from your 2016 part number range.
We improved 2010 iGEM part (Gly4Ser)3 Flexible Peptide Linker BBa_K416001 (GS linker).
In the experiment, we proved the efficiency of our improved GS linker by observing the repellent effect of Hv1a-lectin with GS linker. (See more in the BBa_K1974030 .)
3. Proof of concept
Demonstrate a functional proof of concept of your project. Your proof of concept must consist of a BioBrick device; a single BioBrick part cannot constitute a proof of concept.
We proved the repellent effect of PANTIDE in the experiment. The tobacco cutworms are more likely to eat leaves without PANTIDE. As the concentration of PANTIDE decreased, the area of each leaf that larvae consumed gradually increased. This again proved the repellent effect of PANTIDE. (See more in the Results .)
4.Demonstrate your work
Show your project working under real-world conditions. To achieve this criterion, you should demonstrate your whole system, or a functional proof of concept working under simulated conditions in the lab.
We proved the infrared ray in the channels of our device is able to detect the moving insects. And the number of pests will also be shown on our smartphone in real time. The IoT talk system will send the signal to the spraying system through wifi. And the sprinkler in the farmland will start spraying PANTIDE. (See more in the Device .)
Silver Medal
1.Validated Part / Validated Contribution
Experimentally validate that at least one new BioBrick Part or Device of your own design and construction works as expected. Document the characterization of this part in the Main Page section of that Part’s/Device’s Registry entry. Submit this new part to the iGEM Parts Registry.
We have constructed 12 BioBricks of PANTIDE and conducted a series of experiments to verify their functions in pest repellent. (See more in the Parts .)
2.Collaborations
Convince the judges you have helped any registered iGEM team from high school, a different track, another university, or another institution in a significant way.(see more in Collaborations )
We held up a two-week workshop for National Taichung First Senior High School students.
We helped National Taichung First Senior High School and Chung Cheng University to establish their first team for next year.
We provided BioBricks to NTHU_Taiwan, NCKU_Tainan and Mindao Senior High School.
We cooperated with NYMU_Taipei to build up a software that can collect long-term weather information and further prediction of pest numbers in Taiwan. (See more in the TaiwanPP_FTP .)
We cooperated with other teams to spread an international survey released by Aachen University.
3.Human Practices
iGEM projects involve important questions beyond the lab bench, for example relating to ethics, sustainability, social justice, safety, security, and intellectual property rights. Demonstrate how your team has identified, investigated, and addressed one or more of these issues in the context of your project. Your activity could center around education, public engagement, public policy issues, public perception, or other activities.(see more in HP/Silver )
We created a board game called ‘’Pest Crisis’’ to teach the concept of BioBrick for the public.
We consulted the professors in Chun Shin University and Taiwan Agricultural Research Institute for the advice about insect cultivations and feeding assays.
We used the IoT talk system in our project which is invented by Professor Lin Yi-Pin of NCTU.
We visited the tea shop owner and organic farmers in green market to ask them about the feasibility and directions of our project.
We attended many conferences in Asia.
We had online meetups with iGEM teams to exchange some project opinions.
To investigate the public willingness, we released an online survey. The result shows that 84% of respondents want to try our PANTIDE.
We held biocamp for high school students and introduced iGEM to them.
Bronze Medal
1.Register and attend
Register for iGEM, have a great summer, and attend the Giant Jamboree.
2.Deliverables
Meet all deliverables on the Requirements page.
3.Attribution
Create a page on your team wiki with clear attribution of each aspect of your project. This page must clearly attribute work done by the students and distinguish it from work done by others, including host labs, advisors, instructors, sponsors, professional website designers, artists, and commercial services.(see more in the Attributioon )
4.Part / Contribution
Document at least one new standard BioBrick Part or Device central to your project and submit this part to the iGEM Registry. You may also document a new application of a BioBrick part from a previous iGEM year, adding that documentation to the part main page.(see more in Parts )
