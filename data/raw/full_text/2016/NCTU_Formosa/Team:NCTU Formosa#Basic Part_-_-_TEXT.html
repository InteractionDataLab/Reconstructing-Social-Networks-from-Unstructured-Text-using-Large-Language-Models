Basic Parts
      We have known the function of the three toxic peptides of PANTIDE, Omega-hexatoxin-Hv1a, µ-segestritoxin-Sf1a, and Orally Active Insecticidal Peptide (OAIP) respectively and they are easy to express with the help of the bacteria E. coli BL21 Rosetta-Gami strain. So, we then start to create BioBricks of these three toxins which we have obtained the nucleotide sequences. We provide the four basic parts with the single genes of Hv1a, Sf1a, OAIP, and snowdrop lectin.
