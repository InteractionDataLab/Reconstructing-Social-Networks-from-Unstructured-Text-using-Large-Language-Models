Overview
The ultimate goal of our project is to implement the whole system including PANTIDE and the device into the agricultural industry and solve the problem caused by the excessive use of the chemical pesticide. Therefore, we design directed human practices that facilitate the project multidimensionally. The human practices consist of five aspectsâ€”Study, collaborations, education, meetups, and further considerations.(see HP/Gold and HP/Silver .)
