Whether the Pantide using in farmlands is a kind of organic agriculture?</P><P class="content-2">Though different institutes have different definitions of the organic agriculture, the main idea is the same. Organic agriculture is based on minimizing the use of external inputs, avoiding the use of synthetic fertilizers and pesticides. The primary goal is to optimize the health and productivity of interdependent communities of soil life, plants, animals and people.</P><P class="content-2">The International Federation of Organic Agriculture Movement (IFOAM) defines four principles of the organic agriculture and our Pantide conform with all of them:</P><P class="content-2"><SPAN style="font-weight:bold;">Health:</SPAN> To sustain and enhance the health of ecosystems and organisms. It should avoid the use of synthetic fertilizers and pesticides that may have adverse health effects.</P><P class="content-3">Our Pantide is a kind of biorepellent, which is natural and eco-friendly. Compare to the chemical pesticide, Pantide can minimize the harm to the environment and can make a healthier ecosystem.</P><P class="content-2"><SPAN style="font-weight:bold;">Ecology:</SPAN> Be based on living ecological systems and cycles, work with them, emulate them and help sustain them. </P><P class="content-3">The main idea of our Pantide is the food chain from spiders to insects. We want to choose an ecological way to help the farming but not to harm the environment so we learn from the Mother Nature to ensure our Pantide is sustainable and safe.</P><P class="content-2"><SPAN style="font-weight:bold;">Fairness:</SPAN> Should build on relationships that ensure fairness with regard to the common environment and life opportunities.</P><P class="content-3">Pantide is oral-active so that it is only against the insects eating the crops. Also, because of the distinctive mechanism, it only works on the specific species that have adverse effect on the crops. As a result, the Pantide will not harm other organisms to make sure that we maintain the fairness among the ecosystem.</P><P class="content-2"><SPAN style="font-weight:bold;">Care:</SPAN> Practitioners of Organic Agriculture can enhance efficiency and increase productivity, but this should not be at the risk of jeopardizing health and well-being.</P><P class="content-3">Consequently, new technologies need to be assessed and existing methods reviewed.
Our device can enhance efficiency due to the remote monitor. It can not only decrease the burden of the farmers but also increase productivity. Before using in the practical farmlands, we have tested many times.
</P><P class="content-1">Q2. What should we do to get the pesticide permit?</P><P class="content-2">Most countries share the similar application process to permit the new pesticide.</P><P class="content-2">Pantide is a new biorepellent so it might be determine whether it is a biopesticide or not. If it belongs to pesticide, we first need to confirm what kind of pesticide we made. In most countries like Taiwan and the USA, Pantide belongs to the category of the biopesticide, while some countries, EU and Japan included, consider that there are no viable bacteria in the Pantide, so it applies to the regulation of the chemical pesticide.</P><P class="content-2">Second, the pesticide and the production plant must be tested to be safe.
Finally, the pesticide must be registered with the related government institution before they can be distributed commercially. A registration application must include information regarding testing, the identity of the product, draft labeling, information on tolerance of residues, and other safety-related information.</P><P class="content-image" style="text-align:center !important;">Figure 2. Logo of Bureau of Animal and Plant Health Inspection and Quarantine, Council of Agriculture (BAPHIQ)</P><P class="content-1">Q3. Is there any related application to the biopesticide?</P><P class="content-2">In Taiwan, to get the government permit, the laboratory need to get the Good Laboratory Practice Application (GLP) first. GLP regulates the safety and the quality of the laboratory in a manufacturing company.</P><P class="content-2">Besides to the permit from the government, there is an application called MIT Smile application, which means the product is made in Taiwan during the whole process.</P><P class="content-2">In the US, the most important application to food and drugs is FDA application given by the Food and Drug Administration.
