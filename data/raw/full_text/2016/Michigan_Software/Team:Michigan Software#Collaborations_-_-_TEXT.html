Rice University iGEM Team
This year, we collaborated with Rice University's iGEM team on an app that would display information such as structure and function of a molecule once the user 'imaged' a moving crystal. The purpose of this project was to make a way for people to get a better understanding about molecules such as hemoglobin, as well as provide insight as to how the structures are determined.
Through the collaboration, we acted as guides for the development of the game, assisting in the preliminary planning stages, finding relevant tutorials and game engines, and acting as a reference for when they were unable to implement features. The collaboration initially began through email correspondence, but was later done through a shared Google Document where they would be able to post questions and we would be able to reply with relevant links and explanations.
