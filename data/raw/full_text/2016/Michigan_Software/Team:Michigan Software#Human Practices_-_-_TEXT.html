ProtoCat 3.0 - Human Practices Overview
Protocol Model Development
The initial work on how we would represent a protocol in our database involved comparing our preliminary model with a variety of different protocols as well as interviewing our advisers for an intended end user opinion on the matter.
Standard Protocol Format
Opened discussion with OpenWetWare and Protocols.io to develop a protocol file format to simplify the sharing of protocols between online protocol repositories.
