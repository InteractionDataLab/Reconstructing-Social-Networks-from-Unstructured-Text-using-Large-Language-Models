At the beginning of the project, the instructors introduced us to the iGem 2015 group, Team San Andr√©s and Team Liceo Maria Eugenia de Hostos, who told us all about the Giant Jamboree and they have helped us a lot in the lab with a couple of new university groups. Two students of the university have helped us too, Sebastian Oyarce and Ana Del Valle. Thank to their and our instructor Javier Villacreses we learn almost every  protocol and we can realize some tests of our project with their help.
Thanks to the differents person who support us with their knowledge, to the experts in biotechnology of  the Universidad Mayor , and the Doctorates students  for their advice, questions and ideas.
With Doctorates, Universidad Mayor.
