Members:
Valentina Ceballos Urrutia
Hello everybody! My name is Valentina and I’m 15 years old. I want to study biotechnology because I love the science, especially molecular biology, I love doing plasmid extraction but I hate doing electrophoresis, it’s so bored.
Natalia Montellano Hernández
Hi! I’m Nati I’d like you to know me better, in science area I love working in the lab, it’s so funny, what I like the most is purified plasmid extraction, I always do that with my friend Valentina Ceballos (read up). Another thing you can know about me is that I was born in USA, well that’s not entirely true, but I would that. what is certain is that I love Disney, and if you are going to IGEM 2016 and see a girl with Minnie ears, it’s me!. So see you there!
Macarena Ramos Briones
Hi, It’s Maca here, I’m in second senior grade and this is my first iGEM experience, I love my team and I really enjoy the work during our project, especially when we work with fire, because is nice and warm, besides we must not work with latex glove, I hate them, never fits me well, other thing that you can know about me is that I love see movies and series, so if you know about a good movie or serie, let me know about it. Good luck, see you on 30th October.
Maximiliano Rojas Álvarez
Hello! my name is Max, I’m in second senior grade and I joined the group because I like the science. I think it’s a great experience work in the lab with my partners. I learnt a lot of things about biotechnology and is something great especially when we do electrophoresis , I love it.
Bastian Sandoval Zúñiga
Hi! I’m Sando, I like science and computers. I’m good to search information for anything and sleep. It’s my first iGEM experiences and I’m expect me and my group, we can have a good experiences and results for the competition.
Isabella Silva
Hello guys I’m Isa, I’m 16 years old, im so curious, creative, social and like the arts, science and maths. My favorite part of this project is the lab work and interact with new people.I love this guys, they makes me happy every class and it will be the one of the best experience of my life.
Karen Vargas Molina
Hi everybody, I’m Karen!. I’m the leader of the group. I’m a dreamer, curious, creative and focused at the same time. I love art and science. It’s my first year in the IGEM experience. I took this opportunity because it mixes the two things that I love the most(art and science). I love working in the lab and discover everyday somethings more because of that. I love my group and faith that we will captivate you, yes,you, the one who is reading this, jahajajah! See you in IGEM superheros!.
Tutores:
Javier Villacreses
He’s a biotechnologist and our teacher, but if we’re honest he’s more than a teacher for us. He is like a our nerd friend, and we say “nerd” because he is  surprisingly intelligent and his jokes are too bad, but we love him. Javier has helped us a lot, he taught us all the process and explains more than once time if necessary and we are thankful for that. The best thing is that HE IS GOING TO TRAVEL WITH US!. We are so happy, not only because we know that he can help us there but that we know we are going to have a very good time if he’s there, if you want to know more of Javier you can meet him in IGEM 2016, so see you there.
Ismael Espinoza:
He is the coordinator of the academy in Universidad Mayor. In some way all this trip it could be not possible if him wouldn't be responsible for all the traveling´s things. He told us about the IGEM and his experience there, also he give us some advices for our hotels and the clothes we should carry. He is a lovely person and he always supports us.
Cristian Ramirez:
He’s our physics teacher, if we’re  honest we were not so close to him, but with time we have learned to know him better, while it’s true that physics is not similar to biotechnology our teacher always tries to help us, and he goes to the classes with us, you never know when you need some about biotechnology, that what we thought, he is going to travel too, so if you have any questions about physics he can answer them, so write your questions and see him there.
