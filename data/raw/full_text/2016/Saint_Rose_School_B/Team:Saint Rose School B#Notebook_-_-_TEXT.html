June
Thursday 2nd:
Scientific fair, Academia de Emprendimiento.
Saturday 25th:
We search for lignin degradation enzymes.
Wednesday 29th:
We investigate for more of these enzymes.
July
Friday 1st:
We create our GMO.
Saturday 2nd:
We did cultivate bacteria with LuxI, LuxR and PLux.
Wednesday 6th:
We extract the plasmids of LuxR, LuxI and PLux from the E.coli bacteria and check it (electrophoresis).
Friday 8th:
We extract LiP and Lac from the plates and then we transform it.
Wednesday 13th:
We made again the cultivate with the plasmid extraction of LuxR, LuxI and PLux.
We cultivate LiP and Lac.
Friday 15th:
Double digestion of LuxR, LuxI and PLux.
Check the electrophoresis.
Friday 22nd:
We found the space where the genes (RFP and CFP)  are, and we extract it from the plates and we transform it.
Saturday 23rd:
We extract the plasmid of LiP and Lac from the cultive, and then we did electrophoresis to check the size.
Friday 29th:
We cultiveted bacteria of RFP and CFP, and then electrophoresis to check the size of the plasmids.
August
Wednesday 3rd:
We extract the plasmid of RFP y CFP.
Presentation of groups progress.
Friday 5th:
We did double digestion  of LiP and Lac, then we did electrophoresis to check the size.
Check the information.
Saturday 6th:
We dedicated to read papers.
We do some investigation and search.
We check the result of the plasmidial extraction of CFP and RFP.
Wednesday 10th:
