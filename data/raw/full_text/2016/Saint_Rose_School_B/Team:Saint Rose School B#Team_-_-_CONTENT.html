I’m a dreamer, curious, creative and focused at the same time. I love art and science. It’s my first year in the IGEM experience. I took this opportunity because it mixes the two things that I love the most(art and science).
I love working in the lab and discover everyday somethings more because of that.
I love my group and faith that we will captivate you, yes,you, the one who is reading this, jahajajah!
See you in IGEM superheros!.</P></DIV><DIV class="icoteam"><H2 style="

"> Javier Villacreses </H3><P style="margin-bottom:41px;">He’s a biotechnologist and our teacher, but if we’re honest he’s more than a teacher for us. He is like a our nerd friend, and we say “nerd” because he is  surprisingly intelligent and his jokes are too bad, but we love him. Javier has helped us a lot, he taught us all the process and explains more than once time if necessary and we are thankful for that. The best thing is that HE IS GOING TO TRAVEL WITH US!. We are so happy, not only because we know that he can help us there but that we know we are going to have a very good time if he’s there, if you want to know more of Javier you can meet him in IGEM 2016, so see you there.

"> Ismael Espinoza: </H3><P> He is the coordinator of the academy in Universidad Mayor. In some way all this trip it could be not possible if him wouldn't be responsible for all the traveling´s things. He told us about the IGEM and his experience there, also he give us some advices for our hotels and the clothes we should carry. He is a lovely person and he always supports us.

"> Cristian Ramirez: </H3><P style="margin-bottom:41px;"> He’s our physics teacher, if we’re  honest we were not so close to him, but with time we have learned to know him better, while it’s true that physics is not similar to biotechnology our teacher always tries to help us, and he goes to the classes with us, you never know when you need some about biotechnology, that what we thought, he is going to travel too, so if you have any questions about physics he can answer them, so write your questions and see him there.
