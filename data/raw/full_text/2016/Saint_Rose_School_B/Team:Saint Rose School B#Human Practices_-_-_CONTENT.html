"> Being in the “Academia de Emprendimiento” is one of the best things that has ever happened to us, not only because you know a lot of peoples like students and teachers who help you anytime you need it ,if not, that you “grow up” in some way with yourself and notice all the possibility that you have to grow with your ideas, your only business. In this Academy we did things that we never imagine we do, first we had publicity class, there we laughed a lot with our teachers, they were so funny and likeable. We had theater class too, where they teach us a few techniques for a presentations in a stage, some class were a little weird or funny to us. Also thanks to the Academy we learned to be more confident with ourself because we have to present in differing situations to different kind of audience like in the “GAM”, in this activity all the teams of Universidad Mayor have to present their projects in an auditorium in front to important scientists, other situation was when we were in the science fair  with other Chileans University where we talk about our projects to students and we introduce them to the science area. To all this presentation we prepare in a different way with the help of the Academia de Emprendimiento, but always at the end of the day we have a very fun day.

Visit of Minister of Economy Mr. Luis Felipe Cespedes to a science fair that we organize to promote our projects about synthetic biology. We explain what was synthetic biology and how it could help our society. We chatted about how our project is a solution to a big problem we have as a country and how science is a super powerful tool to solve our problems.

The representative of CORFO (Corporation for Promotion of Production) was very interested in how being so young, we undertake in our project. He really liked that we focused our research to solve real problems of the country. He said that when we had a prototype ready, they could support as CORFO to develop it more professionally.
<STRONG>2.- Formal presentations mentors </STRONG>
We made formal presentations to researchers from the center of genomics and bioinformatics at the University Mayor (http://www.umayor.cl/genomica/) to technically discuss about how our project develops and listen to their recommendations. As researchers from different areas, we discuss biosafety and bioethics and how to handle these issues in our projects.
