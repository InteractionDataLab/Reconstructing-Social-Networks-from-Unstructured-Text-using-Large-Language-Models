Human Practices
Our team has taken part in many activities related with our project as science´s fairs, visits of experts and exhibitions:
Visit of expert
Orientation of the project by an expert visit: november 13th, 2015.
First science´s fair:  january 7th, 2016
Exhibition Universidad Mayor Manuel Montt:
GAM Exposition & second GAM science fair: june 2nd, 2016.
Being in the “Academia de Emprendimiento” is one of the best things that has ever happened to us, not only because you know a lot of peoples like students and teachers who help you anytime you need it ,if not, that you “grow up” in some way with yourself and notice all the possibility that you have to grow with your ideas, your only business. In this Academy we did things that we never imagine we do, first we had publicity class, there we laughed a lot with our teachers, they were so funny and likeable. We had theater class too, where they teach us a few techniques for a presentations in a stage, some class were a little weird or funny to us. Also thanks to the Academy we learned to be more confident with ourself because we have to present in differing situations to different kind of audience like in the “GAM”, in this activity all the teams of Universidad Mayor have to present their projects in an auditorium in front to important scientists, other situation was when we were in the science fair  with other Chileans University where we talk about our projects to students and we introduce them to the science area. To all this presentation we prepare in a different way with the help of the Academia de Emprendimiento, but always at the end of the day we have a very fun day.

If you need contact us, here´s some information that maybe help you. This information belongs to our leader, Karen Vargas, she can help you to everything you need or if you want to talk with someone else of the group, she can help with that too.

Dissemination activities of synthetic biology and the work that has been done:
1.- Share with the Minister of Economy - CORFO - Science Fair
Visit of Minister of Economy Mr. Luis Felipe Cespedes to a science fair that we organize to promote our projects about synthetic biology. We explain what was synthetic biology and how it could help our society. We chatted about how our project is a solution to a big problem we have as a country and how science is a super powerful tool to solve our problems.
The representative of CORFO (Corporation for Promotion of Production) was very interested in how being so young, we undertake in our project. He really liked that we focused our research to solve real problems of the country. He said that when we had a prototype ready, they could support as CORFO to develop it more professionally.
2.- Formal presentations mentors
We made formal presentations to researchers from the center of genomics and bioinformatics at the University Mayor (http://www.umayor.cl/genomica/) to technically discuss about how our project develops and listen to their recommendations. As researchers from different areas, we discuss biosafety and bioethics and how to handle these issues in our projects.
3.- GAM Fair
We had a great show at the GAM (http://gam.cl/) of synthetic biology where we show our project against more than 400 people, talked of synthetic biology, iGEM competition and explain the impact of our project solve a serious problem as a country.
4.- Festival of Science - EXPLORE
Participate of the feast of science EXPLORE (http://www.explora.cl/), of Ministry of Education, where more than 5,000 people attended and we could have all our work, talked of synthetic biology competition iGEM and explain the impact of our project to solve a serious problem as a country.
5.- Validation of the idea
To reach our prototype we went to ask several people what they thought, we did brainstorming, business model work and other activities to develop a product that was ideal for our needs as a country.
6.- Training
We are prepared to present for that we went to drama school at the Universidad Mayor and made us acting classes, movement and voice, to put together an excellent presentation
7.- Mentors
In addition to researchers from the center of genomics and bioinformatics at the University Mayor (http://www.umayor.cl/genomica/) and the support of our teacher at the school and our instructor Javier Villacreses. We had the visit of mentors from other universities in the country to advise us if we were on the right track in our Project
