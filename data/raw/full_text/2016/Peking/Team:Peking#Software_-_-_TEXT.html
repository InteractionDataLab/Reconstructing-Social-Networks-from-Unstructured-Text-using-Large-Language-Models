Brief Description
SoP is originally built to help our team members work out molecular weight distribution results more efficiently, at least more efficient than excel. Now for the wish of sharing, the software was published on webpage so that everyone can try our method or even compare it with experiments. Note that this application exclusively uses the formula described in our “Model-Mass Distribution” part.
