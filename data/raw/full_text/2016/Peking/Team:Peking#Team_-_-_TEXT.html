Our Team
Over the past six months, we have formed a professional and passionate team, Peking iGEM 2016, with shared goal to strive for, mutual trust, and effective communication. Students from different fields join forces to make the team almighty and competitive.
Meet our talented team.
On this page, you can find the information about everybody contributed to the project. We would like to express our special gratitude to our instructors for their continuous support and encouragement. Furthermore, we would like to acknowledge our advisors and all the others who provided valuable advices and essential materials to us. The following is our amazing team.
Li Cheng
Life Sciences
Li Cheng is the team leader of Peking iGEM team 2016. He participated in designing and optimization of this project, meanwhile he worked as a technician. As the captain, he could unite his fellows in a humorous style. He is interested in synthetic biology because he wanna create something new to benefit humans. A living machine? That is the most exciting thing in the universe! Out of the lab, he enjoys flowers, Bilibili and history.
Yang Xiaoyu
Life Sciences
Yang Xiaoyu is a rising junior at the Peking University, majoring in life sciences. His involvement in the Peking iGEM team was his first major research project. During the project he participated in plasmid construction, protein purification as well as lab management. He aimed to devote all his passion to the research of synthetic biology. During free time Xiaoyu enjoyed traveling around the world.
Zhao Shijun
Life Sciences
Zhao Shijun is an undergraduate from the School of Life Sciences, Peking University. He is the major experiment designer of molecular cloning including part of construction. He also participated in the secretion part. He enjoyed fighting for the same goals with other members. When he is at leisure during experiments, Zhao Shijun enjoys playing the computer games LOL and World of Warship. He makes a lot of fun in the lab.
Bai Ke
Life Sciences
Bai Ke is an undergraduate from Peking University, majoring in Life Science. He focused on the secretion part of the project, which included molecular cloning, selection of signal peptides and assessment of secretion efficiency.
Wei Jingyi
Life Sciences
Wei Jingyi is a junior undergraduate from Peking University, School of Life Sciences. She was responsible for the secretion part in
B. subtilis
, including host cultivation, signal peptide construction and transformation. She also participated in wiki building and human practice. In her spare time, she enjoys reading novels and drawing, which boosts her imagination and creativity.
Chang Xuyao
Clinical Medicine
Chang Xuyao is a junior undergraduate majoring in Clinical Medicine in the 4th Medical College of Peking University. He participated in the construction of the secretion system and laborious but joyful molecular cloning. He enjoyed being a member of iGEM lab fighting to achieve the same goal with a bunch of buddies. He loves piano music, especially those composed by Joe Hisaishi in movies directed by Hayao Miyazaki.
Ning Xin
Clinical Medicine
Ning Xin is an undergraduate from Peking University, majoring in Clinical Medicine. He is a member of the secretion group and mainly dealt with molecular cloning. Attracted by the charm of synthetic and quantitative biology, he decided to join Peking iGEM team, and he feels very happy to work along with such excellent and funny teammates.
Li Jiamian
Life Sciences
Li Jiamian is a rising junior at the School of Life Sciences of PKU, who has worked on Wiki building and graphic designing in our team. He loves photography and doing some designing by using Adobe stuff. The interests of him in synthetic biology is paper-based Isothermal nucleic acid amplification of Influenza. He really enjoys the life working hard for a goal with a team.
Wang Yuqing
Basic Medical Sciences
Wang Yuqing is a senior undergraduate from Peking University, majoring in basic medical sciences. She's mainly responsible for wiki building and lab management. She also did some wet lab job when needed, including the molecular cloning and functional description of our proteins, kind of versatile ha-ha. She's conscientious about her work and positive in life. iGEM and all the excellent teammates have made her summer vacation more splendid.
Lv Nayun
Basic Medical Sciences
Lv Nayun is a junior undergraduate from Peking University, majoring in basic medical sciences. She took part in the wet lab, firstly in molecular cloning and then protein extraction. She loves iGEM, as well as calligraphy, table tennis and reading. Well, if you also love them all, please contact her. (smiling)
Teng Huaiyuan
Physics
Teng Huaiyuan has been working on an automation programming task in one of PKU's condensed physics lab. He wishes to try different engineerings so he is now taking part in IGEM. Sometimes he can't help inserting fancy graphical interface in his program.
Dong Yiming
Academy for Advanced Interdisciplinary Studies
DONG Yiming is a graduate student majoring in Academy for Advanced Interdisciplinary Studies, Peking University. She is one of the student leaders of our team. She helped us solve the problem together. She also participated in the laborious molecular cloning and protein purification with other team members. "Teamwork divides the task and multiplies the success." She enjoys working together with our fellows for the same goal.
Yang Changru
Life Sciences
Yang Changru mainly participated in the test of proteins and the construction of our model on the basis of the former. Majoring in Biology and deeply attracted by other subjects of Science, he tend to try his best to fuse various knowledge into the study of life science. He thanked his friends of Peking 2016 a lot for their kindness and encouragement.
Li Yuexuan
Pharmaceutical Sciences
Li Yuexuan is a junior undergraduate from Peking University, majoring in pharmaceutical sciences. She was responsible for laborious molecular cloning with other team members and experiments assessing functions of designed proteins. She enjoys fighting with her fellows for the same goal and takes great interest in iGEM competition.
Wang Dingyu
Clinical Medicine
Wang Dingyu majors in clinical medicine in Health Science Center of Peking. He took part in protein extraction and purification as well as assessment of secretion efficiency. iGEM will be a memorable trip taking both enthusiasm and pains in his twenties.
