Interlab
The Peking iGEM 2016 team is participating in the third year of the iGEM Interlab study along with about 100 teams. We focused on quantifying expression of GFP in common, comparable or absolute units.

Background
“All of the 2016 iGEM teams are invited and encouraged to participate in the Third International InterLaboratory Measurement Study in synthetic biology.” Our team took part in this study which aimed to standardize the measurements of fluorescence in different labs. The main task was to quantify expression of GFP in common, comparable or absolute units. In our case, we measured fluorescence using plate reader.
Design
Fluorescence is widely used as a proxy for promoter activity by expressing fluorescent proteins such as green fluorescent protein (GFP). Despite this is an indirect measurement, it provides a useful insight into expression levels and has significant advantage that it could be ontinuously monitored without disrupting cells.
Fluorescence/OD600 is routinely used to give an adjustment of the relative expression per cell.
We aim to do this using the supplied FITC as a standard reference material. The standard curve could be constructed via measuring the fluorescence of a dilution series. We have previously performed this standard curve on our own instrument alongside a standard curve for purified GFP. Using these standard curves alongside your own standard curve for FITC it is thus possible to transform your relative measurements of fluorescence into absolute measurements of GFP molecules.
However, we aim to contain instrument variability, at least to some degree, by measuring a standard scattering solution of a mono-dispersed silica suspension (LUDOX). The objective is to see if a simple, single fixed-point measurement can be used as a ratiometric adjustment to provide greater uniformity in fluorescence/OD600 measurements across sites.

Description
Figure 1. Above: from left to right: D1, D2, D3, Negative, Positive. Below: five mediums containing five different bacteria.
Plasmids containing promoters and GFP were taken from The 2016 DNA Distribution Kit and all devices were transformed into E. coli. Fluorescence of colonies was checked up under UV light.
5 ml of liquid LB-M medium with chloramphenicol were inoculated with two chosen colonies of each device. Liquid cultures were incubated for 16~18 hours in HONOUR INCURATOR SHAKER placed in incubator. OD of these cultures was measured by MAPADA UV-3100PC SPECTROPHOTOMETER and diluted to 0.02. Fluorescence of biological and also technical replicates was measured using Thermo VARIOSKAN FLASH following our protocol.
