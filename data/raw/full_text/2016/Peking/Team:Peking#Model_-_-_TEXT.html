Model
The Peking iGEM team 2016 has set up a model on the basis of the principles of polymer science, to describe the fundamental properties of our bio-materials.
The Peking iGEM Team has learned Wallace H. Carothers’s and Paul J. Flory’s methods to predict the gel point of three-dimensional polymerization, and developed the latter as a way to forecast that point of their SpyTag/SpyCatcher crosslinking system. They made it a way to choose the monomers suitable for crosslinking reaction.
The Peking iGEM Team has studied and expanded Paul J. Flory's method to predict the molecular weight distribution of polymer. They compared their reaper’s experimental molecular weight distribution data with the theoretical one and find it is necessary to improve the polymer network's orthogonality with its functional protein. To optimize the reaper's design, they have brought up some compare standards.
SoP is originally built to help our team members work out molecular weight distribution results more efficiently, at least more efficient than excel. Now for the wish of sharing, the software was published on webpage so that everyone can try our method or even compare it with experiments. Note that this application exclusively uses the formula described in our "Model-Mass Distribution" part.
