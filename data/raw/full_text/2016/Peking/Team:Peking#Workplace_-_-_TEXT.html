Description of SoP
For the software given bellow, it was programmed based on eq (5):
Most of these parameters’ definitions can be found from our introduction page
The “Weight Constraint” sets the confine of the molecular weight coordinate for both displaying and calculating. The “Monomer Weight”, defined as its name, may affect the height and the horizontal position of a bar in the chart. If one wish to compare the generated chart with experimental data that uses mass concentration as unit, the molar concentration must be changed according to the “Monomer Weight” as well. Kd, Pf and Pc are automatically generated after inputting other parameters (Kd and Pf affect each other). Click “Generate Chart” to obtain the theoretical outcome from eq (5). Adjust Pa_d, Pb_d and Pf according to your experimental data to find a similar point. The optimized value of Pa_d and Pb_d would be the indicator of hindrance or recruiting.
For example, the parameters given bellow corresponds to a reaction under the following condition:
I. 1 mol/L of 3-A monomers and 1mol/L of 3-B monomers are mixed together. A 3-A monomer has three functional groups a that can exclusively react with one functional group b.
II. The molecule weight of 3-A is 21.4kDa and the molecule weight of 3-B is 55.4kDa.
III. The column chart to be generated describes the state at "Pf = 0.3" (30% of all the functional groups have reacted, and the other 70% have not).
IV. Things like non-reactive protein attached to 3-A (or 3-B) may have influence on the reaction between a and b. If one of a 3-A's functional group a has reacted, the other functional groups on this 3-A will have a 1.5 times of its original chance to react. "Pb_d=1" means no such effect is imposed on b.
Sometimes the following parameters also need to be cared:
I. Weight Constraint= 300 makes the horizontal coordinate ranges from 21.4 kDa (the smallest molecule weight in the system) to 300kDa.
II. Click "Logarithmic Coordinate/Linear Coordinate" to change the attribute of the chart's horizontal coordinate.
III. If the Pf/Pc at the left-bottom corner of the parameter panel becomes green, which means gelation, the result of the generated column chart is invalid.
