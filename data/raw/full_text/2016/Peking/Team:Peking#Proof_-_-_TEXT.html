Proof of Concept
Crosslinking
By taking advantage of the covalent crosslinking of SpyTag and SpyCatcher, a polymer network was designed to possess special properties, such as strong mechanical strength, large contact area and stable structure.
Uranyl Adsorption
Super Uranyl-binding Protein (SUP) is stable and highly selective for uranyl which may cause negative impact on the environment. Triple SpyTag-SUP (3A-SUP) was constructed to adsorb uranyl, and the cross-linked product of 3A-SUP and 3B showed an even better adsorption capacity.
Clearance
The monomeric streptavidin constructed in the polymer network could realize the clearance of Spy Crosslinking Network in the environment by interacting with biotinylated magnetic beads.
Secretion
To make the polymer network reproductive and economical, a signal peptide library was constructed. We carried out a series of experiments to find an optimal secretion strategy.
