Fig. 1. Basic structure of the following parts
BBa_K1989000
Fig. 2. 3A: Triple SpyTag SUP: Super Uranyl-binding Protein
Super Uranyl-binding Protein (SUP) was fused to 4*(VPGVG) spaced triple SpyTag. The fused protein is used to generate the uranyl-binding capacity in our polymer network system. Paired with triple SpyCatcher ( BBa_K1989001 ) and triple SpyTag with mSA ( BBa_K1989002 ), our polymer network system is constructed.
BBa_K1989001
Fig. 3. 3A: Triple SpyTag mSA: Monomeric streptavidin
Triple SpyCatcher was spaced by 15*(VPGVG). Paired with triple SpyTag with SUP ( BBa_K1989000 ) and triple SpyTag with mSA ( BBa_K1989002 ), our polymer network system is constructed.

Fig. 4. 3B: Triple SpyCatcher
Monomeric streptavidin (mSA) was fused to 4*(VPGVG) spaced triple SpyTag. The fused protein is used to generate the recyclable capacity in our polymer network system. Paired with triple SpyCatcher ( BBa_K1989001 ) and triple SpyTag with SUP ( BBa_K1989000 ), our polymer network system is constructed.

Members of Peking iGEM 2016 team  devoted themselves to constructing a part library of the multifunctional material. We have not only submitted all of new basic Spy network parts, but also provided multiple composite parts combining Spy network with other metal binding proteins and fluorescent proteins. We also constructed a library of signal peptides and validated the secretion capacity of our material.
Functions of all the parts were tested and validated both in controlled laboratory condition and in normal condition. The parts allow simple modules insertion using 3A Assembly, Gibson and Golden Gate Assembly which making them convenient and powerful tools for other iGEM teams.
