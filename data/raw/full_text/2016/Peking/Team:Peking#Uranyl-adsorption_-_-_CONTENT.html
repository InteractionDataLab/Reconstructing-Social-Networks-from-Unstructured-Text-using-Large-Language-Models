The most stable and relevant uranium ion in aerobic environments is the uranyl cation. Super Uranyl-binding Protein (SUP) has been rationally designed via structural calculations and functional modification to specifically bind uranyl cations. According to the researchers’ results, SUP is thermodynamically stable and offers very high afﬁnity and selectivity for uranyl with a K<SUB>d</SUB> of 7.4 fM and &gt;10,000-fold selectivity over other metal ions<SUP>1</SUP>. The binding features of SUP are described later in more detail (Fig. 1.).</P><FIGURE><FIGCAPTION style="text-align:left;">                    Fig. 1. Uranyl-binding afﬁnity and selectivity of SUP.

Subsequently, a uranyl solution in TBS buffer was prepared and its pH value adjusted appropriately.

We used the uranyl concentration of the filtrates from the control groups as the actual uranyl concentration to account for the adsorption of uranyl on centrifuge filters. Two different methods were applied to determine the uranyl concentrations in the filtrate. For higher concentrations (&gt;1μM), we used a modification of the Arsenazo III method<SUP>1</SUP>. For lower concentrations (&lt;1μM), ICP-MS was employed. </P><FIGURE><FIGCAPTION>Fig. 5. Uranyl detection assay with Arsenazo III. (A) Mechanism of chromogenic reaction.
