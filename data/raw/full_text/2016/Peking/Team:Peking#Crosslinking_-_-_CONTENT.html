For example, polymers typically offer greater mechanical strength and a larger contact area. They are more easier to handle. We thus considered crosslinking the monomers to form polymers, and take the latter as the basic functional units.</P><H3 class="classic-title"><SPAN>Characteristics</SPAN></H3><P>Firstly, the monomers need to be able to crosslink under complex environmental conditions and show high preference for the reaction with each other. Faster and more selective reactions would be highly helpful for practical applications.</P><P>Secondly, since functional proteins are to be fused to the monomers to achieve the final goals, their orthogonality must be considered. If there are no covalent interactions between monomer backbones and the attached functional elements, the target proteins could be used to functionalize a polymerized network, thus adequately taking advantage of the superiority of polymers.</P><P>What’s more, polymers are comparatively easy to recover and could thus be eco-friendly. Since the aim is to construct a brand new material, it is extremely important to consider its potential effects on the environment from the onset of the project.</P><H3 class="classic-title" style="font-size:20px;"><SPAN>Implementation of Crosslinking - the SpyTag-SpyCatcher System</SPAN></H3><P>Inspired by the autocatalytic formation of the isopeptide bond between a specific Lys and an Asp residue in Streptococcus pyogenes (Spy) fibronectin-binding protein FbaB, researchers split its autocatalytic domain, CnaB2, and obtained two peptides which they named SpyTag and SpyCatcher. The resulting peptides are able to form isopeptide bonds with each other spontaneously. SpyTag, SpyCatcher and their stable cross-linking products provided us with an ideal tool to manipulate the protein polymer network<SUP>1</SUP>.</P><FIGURE><FIGCAPTION style="text-align:justify">

The functional domains provided by SpyTag and SpyCatcher were linked via an elastin like protein (ELP), yielding the new fusion protein monomers able to undergo three-dimensional polymerization (TDP). This kind of polymerization could yield hyper-branched products and polymer network at low concentrations, and gels with a high degree of cross-linkage at high concentrations<SUP>2,3</SUP>.</P><FIGURE><FIGCAPTION>

We thus chose 3A-SUP(n&gt;=3). Although 4A-SUP and 6A-SUP performed better than 3A-SUP in crosslinking since it has more SpyTag groups available to react with 3B, other experiments showed that 4/6A-SUP performed poorer than 3A-SUP in uranyl adsorption at the same concentration (see the Uranyl adsorption part). Following the analysis presented here, we defined the optimal n count as 3.</P><FIGURE><FIGCAPTION style="text-align:center;">

The products were mainly oligomers due to the ease with which such oligomers could form loops, which hinders the linkage between different monomers at such low concentrations (Fig. 4. A, B and C). Interestingly, with the restriction that A and B are supplied in equimolar concentrations and that the initial content of 3B is constant, the crosslinking abilities of these monomers at low concentrations were found to be different from each other.

Given that the Spy Crosslinking Network would face an aqueous environment with nearly neutral pH in practical applications, and since the proteins have their own pH optima, we decided to use a pH gradient of 6.3/7.3/8.3. 3A-SUP and 3B monomers were first dissolved in TBS at certain pH values, after which they were contacted at pH values from the mentioned gradient at 25°C for 2 hours. Samples were taken every 30min in order to investigate the variation tendency of the monomers. Finally, SDS-PAGE was used to separate the proteins and the gels were scanned and analyzed using the software Lane 1D. Thus, the relationship between time and the content of 3B and 3A was measured.

According to this result, we were able to conclude that higher temperature would lead to faster consumption of monomers, whereby we did not see any changes in the weight distribution of polymer homologs at the designated time scale. We assumed that it should be easier for oligomers to form loops (intramolecular reactions) at lower concentrations, and that the time scale of sampling was too coarse to show this variation. Even though the rate of polymerization could be described by the consumption rate of functional groups, we decided to use the consumption rate of monomers to describe the overall tendency.</P><H3 class="classic-title"><SPAN> Concentration Gradient Experiment </SPAN></H3><P>The third part is concerned with optimal monomer concentrations. At low concentrations, the polymers would cross-link and not polymerize, but oligomerize. According to the basics of polymer science, the differences between these two processes could be described according to crosslinking density, which is large in the former, and rather small in the latter case. From this point of view, if we hope to increase the mass, strength and contact area of polymers, we have to mix the monomers at high concentrations. Thus, understanding the relationship between the monomer concentrations and the variation of mass distribution of polymers is quite essential.</P><FIGURE><FIGCAPTION>

Crosslinking leads to oligomerization at low monomer concentrations, and produces highly-crosslinked polymers with larger masses at high monomer concentrations. To this end, we have determined the optimal conditions for polymerization, which consisted of appropriately low pH, appropriately high temperature and comparatively higher monomer concentrations. The findings were in accordance with the universal principles of polyester condensation, as expected.</P><DIV class="references"><H3>References:</H3><P>[1].
