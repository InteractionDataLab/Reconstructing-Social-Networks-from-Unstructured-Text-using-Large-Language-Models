LI Cheng mainly focused on the overall operating of the team, meanwhile he took part in the evaluation of protein function. He was also involved in team interaction and academic communication.
YANG Xiaoyu was responsible for the plasmid construction at early stage and then mainly focused on the protein purification. He also participated in secretion effect examination.
BAI Ke was in charge of all experiments related to secretion, including plasmid construction, gene expression and secretory protein examination. He is also one of the speakers who give presentation.
DONG Yiming was responsible for building secretion module, parts and the interlab.
LI Yuexuan was responsible for uranyl adsorption capacity test assay.
YANG Changru was mainly responsible for the test experiment (crosslinking) of protein and modeling, as well as designing some plasmids. He also did some quantitative experiments of uranyl absorption and secretion with the cooperation of teammates.
ZHAO Shijun devoted himself to molecular cloning and part construction.
LYV Nayun took part in the protein purification and the analysis of the questionnaire results.
WANG Dingyu was responsible for protein purification and some art design.
LI Jiamian was the art designer and photographer of our team and he participated in wiki building and PowerPoint design.
WEI Jingyi was responsible for plasmid construction for Secretion Part.
WANG Yuqing was the lab manager and in charge of wiki building, she also participated in human practices, art design and part of the experimental work.
TENG Huaiyuan was in charge of modeling and software design. He studied Flory J.Paul's theory in polymer chemistry and furthermore established the model of molecular weight distribution in our case.
NING Xin was mainly responsible for the molecular cloning of the secretion system, while participating in the measurement of proteins's functions as well.
CHANG Xuyao was in charge of plasmid construction of the Secretion Part.

We'd like to thank all those who have helped us over the summer. Without their sincere support, the Uranium Reaper would have not been achieved.
General Support
Prof. OUYANG Qi, Prof. LOU Chunbo, Dr. ZHANG Haoqian, ZHANG Yihao and other teachers helped us during our brainstorming and gave us useful suggestions.
Prof. OUYANG Qi and Prof. LIU Chunli kindly provided the laboratory to us.
ZHANG Yihao gave us meticulous guidance and great help, from the beginning to the end.
Materials Support
