Introduction
      We  are  SYSU-CHINA, a  warm  family  consisting of members  expertizing  in  various  fields. We worked  together for  almost a year  to achieve what we are  longing  to, to  realize  our  CYCLEBOW. During the last few years, we have  good  performance in iGEM and,  in 2016, “May the force be with us”.

Instructors
Junjiu Huang Junjiu Huang
Dr. Junjiu Huang is our instructor. He is the professor of Stem Cell and Functional Genomics Laboratory, School of Life Sciences, Sun Yat-sen University. He got his BSc in biochemistry in 2004 and his Ph.D in cell biology in 2009 from Sun Yat-sen University. A major area of his interest is how stem cells keep themselves renewal and what factors can induce stem cells differentiation specially. Last year, he was elected the Nature 2015 the world's ten largest scientific figure.
Feng Liu Feng Liu
Dr. Feng Liu is our vice instructor, an Assistant Professor of “100 Top Talents Program”, School of Life Sciences, Sun Yat-sen University. Dr. Liu received his Ph.D. in Biochemistry and Molecular biology at Peking University, China and further got postdoc training in Neurosciences at University of California, San Francisco. Research interest: molecular mechanism of organismal aging and cellular senescence.
Yan Zhang Yan Zhang
Professor Yan Zhang is our instructor and fund supporter. Obtained her Ph.D from Hiroshima University, she was appointed Professor in Sun Yat-sen University in 2007 and is the group leader of cancer and stem cell biology. Her research interests are focused on cancer stem cells (CSC) and stem cells, including investigation of CSC biological characteristics, screening key molecules and signaling pathways regulating CSC differentiation or trans-differentiation. Her kind help lays the foundation of our whole project.
