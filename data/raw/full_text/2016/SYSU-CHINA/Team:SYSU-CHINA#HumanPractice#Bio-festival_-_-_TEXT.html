2016 Bio-festival
Figure1. Happy activities in 2016 Bio-festival. Show our posters and game booth.
       We also  participated  in the 2016  Bio-festival held by the student union of School of Life  Science, SYSU and had our  own  game  booth. We  designed a  darts  game  to  introduce  different  types  of biobricks , where participants can  get a  souvenir only by shooting the right type. We  also made many cards with  some simple  problems about  iGEM  competition,  recombinase system, brainbow, chasis organisms and synthetic biology on one side and corresponding answers on the other side.
      After encouraging participants to guess and  remember the  answers, we gave them souvenirs and explained  the  answers to  make  the concepts  clear to them . Besides, with posters of our project, we introduced the concept, design and values  of Cyclebow to those interested in it. The festival lasted for about  6 hours and many  passers-by  in campus  including students  from different  majors, kids  and their parents living around, people working in the campus and visitors participated in our games .
      We are  pleased to  see that many  people  show interest in  what we showed. We believe  that this kind of activity does do something to spread the great idea of synthetic biology.
