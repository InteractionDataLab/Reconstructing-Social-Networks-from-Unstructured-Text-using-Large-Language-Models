National Teenager High School Science Camp
(Central China iGEM Consortium)
Figure1. Xinyi Liu was giving a lecture in Teenager High School Science Camp.
       In July 18, 2016, we  were  honored  to give  a  lecture to the  students of National Teenager High School Science Camp as invited  speakers. The National Teenager High  School Science Camp  aims to make  full  use  of  the  resources  of  universities  in China to  cultivate the science-related ability of teenagers. More  than 10,000  students  attended  in  this  camp  every  year, with  alternative  holding universities  throughout the country. Sun Yat-Sen University is always one of the holding universities.
      This  year, more  than  70  high  school  students  from  7  provinces (Guangdong, Hubei, Qinghai, Xinjiang, Yunnan, Sichuan and Chongqing) came to SYSU. We first used the metaphor of toy bricks to make the concept of standardization clear to the teenagers. After briefly introducing iGEM  competition and  our  team  SYSU-CHINA , we  mainly talked  about the concept, design  and  values of our project Cyclebow . Finally, we said something about “ How  to  be  a  good  iGEMer ” to  give  advises  to  those interested in synthetic biology. The teenagers present for the lecture showed huge interest to what we talked about. Some of them asked very  good questions and  showed friendly attitudes to this  frontier of science.
      Frankly  speaking, we  believe  it worthwhile  to participate in  such an education  activity and bring more students to the wonderful world of synthetic biology .This was a big success and we would  like to continue such kind of human practice in the future.
