Project Safety
     In our project design, no part  with  safety  flag  is involved. Either combined  or individual, our parts and systems have no toxic or virulence effects.
     E.coli DH5α and DB 3.1 from  Risk  Group 1 are  used for  molecular  cloning,  and human cell  line A- 549, MCF-7,Hela and hMSC from  Risk  Group 2 are  used  as  biological chassis. Beyond  that, no Risk Group 3 or 4 organisms are involved in our project.
     Our project is for research use  only and therefore doesn't include releasing into human body or the environment.
Lab Safety
     The whole project is  completed in BSL-2 laboratory  equipped  with sink,  eyewash and emergency shower. Class II Biological Safety Cabinet is used during operation of organisms.
     Stable transfection is conducted via Lentivirus from Risk Group 2.
     To protect lab personnel from  infection and other hazards, our  team members are  trained with lab procedures and always wear laboratory gowns, gloves and masks during operation.
     The GMOs  and  their  products  are  strictly preserved in lab environment, and  all  lab  wastes  are stored   in  enclosed  container  and  sterilized  based  on  instruction  in  lab  biosafety  manual  before disposal.
Shipping Safety
     None of the parts submitted are from organisms  on  Australia  Group List  and  U. S. Select Agents and Toxins List.
     Stable transfection is conducted via Lentivirus from Risk Group 2.
     As instructed on iGEM website,  plasmids  submitted  are  dried down and sealed with adhesive foil, and plates are covered by plastic lid and clearly labelled as DNA without disguise.
