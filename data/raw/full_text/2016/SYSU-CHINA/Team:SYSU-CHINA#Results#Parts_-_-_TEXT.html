Abstract for parts
     The genetic circuits of our project Cyclebow included sequences of cyclic promoters, recombinases (and their recognition sites) and fluorescent genes. This summer, we tried hard to standardize most of them into the backbone pSB1C3 so that we can share these useful parts with the whole iGEM community.
     This is the list of our biobricks:

System UNITs
BBa_K1926011: The SNAP UNIT: SNAP-tag flanked by loxP
Description:
This part is the SNAP UNIT of cyclebow system including an sv40 nuclear location sequence (NLS), a covalent labeling of fusion proteins named SNAP-tag® and an sv40 terminator flanked by homodromous recognition site of recombinase CRE named loxP. The whole part can be cut off by CRE.
You may use this part to:
1) Localize proteins in vivo with BLOCK and dye from NEB company;
2) Dye after blocking, you are able to see whether an event have an influence on the localization and expression of the interested protein;
3) Fast cut off this part by transient transfecting recombinase gene into nucleus.
Source:
The SNAP-tag® was brought from NEB company. NLS and sv40 terminator were got from commercial plasmid: pentry nls GFP/pcdna3.1.
More detail about this part.
BBa_K1926012: The VIKA UNIT: recombinase VIKA flanked by Vox
Description:
This part is the VIKA UNIT of cyclebow system including an sv40 nuclear location sequence (NLS), a recombinase gene named VIKA and an sv40 terminator flanked by homodromous recognition site of recombinase VIKA named Vox. The whole part can be cut off by VIKA. This part is the improvement of the BBa_K1641003 ，which is a plain VIKA.
You may use this part to:
1) Test the cut-off efficiency of recombinase VIKA by qRT-PCR;
2) Fast cut off this part by transient transfecting recombinase gene into nucleus;
3) Do lineage tracking.
Source:
The recombinase gene VIKA and its RTS Vox were got through denovo synthesis. NLS and sv40 terminator were got from commercial plasmid: pentry nls GFP/pcdn3.1.
