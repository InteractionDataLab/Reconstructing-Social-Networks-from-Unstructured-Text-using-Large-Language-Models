Instructors’ attribution
    We are the luckiest team as we are accompanied by such supportive instructors!
Junjiu Huang
     As our PI, Professor Huang guided us with the decision of Cyclebow, and helped us establish its application. He also helped us contact our host lab, and instructed us in cell cultivation and cell lines decision.
     In CCiC, he presented a speech at the opening ceremony which gave us sincerely wishes and strength to stick to our goals. He also attended the first presentation day, and gave precious advice to the presenters.
Feng Liu
     As our vice PI, doctor Liu provided us with tremendous help. As he is working in the host lab we applied for, he helped us connect lab members for borrowing plasmids or cell lines and arranged space for us to put our reagents and frozen cells. He also helped with decision making and experimental plans making during the project process.
     In CCiC, he presented a speech at the closing ceremony addressing his highly appreciation to this consortium and encouraging all the iGEMers.
     He also helped with booking the hotels and airline tickets, and he will accompany us to the Great Jamboree in Boston.
Yan Zhang
     As the vice dean and the principal of iGEM program in our School or Life Sciences, Professor Zhang put great attention in our project this year and was also willing to support us. She attended our thesis proposal, and gave useful advice as she is an expert in stem cell researches.
     She also attended our CCiC and gave a speech in the opening ceremony, approving our work and encouraging undergrads to proceed scientific researches.
Supports from host lab
    Such a wonderful and cherishing experience with the lab!
Our host lab this year is the lab of Stem Cell and Functional Genomics Laboratory of the School of Life Sciences. We received mass support from staffs and lab members throughout our project process, which includes:
Commonly used reagents such as PBS, ethanol, and materials like centrifuge tubes, and experimental instruments like incubators and centrifuges are all provided by our host lab.
Lab manager Ms. Zhong and lab assistant Ms. Sun helped us with all the reagent booking, by sending our booking lists to specific reagent agencies.
Lab members lent us cell lines of Hela, A549, MCF-7, 293T, parts of mCherry and CYAN, and all the vectors we needed for experiments. They also generously gave us advice on many experimental details.
Supports from other teams
    iGEM is a big family!
Exchange ideas with SZU, FAFU and XMU
     After Synbiobeta Activate-Shenzhen, team SZU founded a meet up to exchange ideas. During the meet up, we help SZU to debug the construction of their circuits and the project design.
Exchange parts with SYSU-Software and FAFU-China
     We shared iGEM interlab kits and iGEM plate kits with SYSU-Software. During our experiments, we found out that one of our Interlab plasmids (Device I) could not be transformed well in bacterial culture medium. So we borrowed some plasmids from SYSU-Software. Furthermore, SYSU-Software had used up one of their plate kits (B0015 terminator) and we gave them ours.
     We received several parts (CFP, YFP) from team FAFU-China when the shipment of Biobrick to China is still confusing. Sincerely thanks to FAFU-China!
Attending CCiC
     28 teams and more than 200 students came to attend our CCiC. Everyone enjoyed the time and harvest a lot. Thank all the iGEMers for their participation!
