Cyclebow design
Design Framework
      Our system consists of three circuits:STARTER CIRCUIT,COUNTER CIRCUIT and REPORTER CIRCUIT.
Figure 1. Concept map of STARTER CIRCUIT
       STARTER CIRCUIT is a tet-on system that with the induction of Doxycycline, recombinase Cre will express. The expression of Cre triggers COUNTER CIRCUIT and REPORTER CIRCUIT.
Figure 2. Concept map of COUNTER CIRCUIT
      COUNTER CIRCUIT  is the  recombinase circuit with  lined  up SNAP  UNIT and  recombinase UNITs.The SNAP UNIT consists   of SNAP-tag (NE pSNAP-tag®, which  can  be  labeled  by  adding specific substrates)  flanking with LoxP  (the RTS of Cre).The recombinase UNITs include VIKA UNIT, consisting of Vika recombinase  flanking  with Vox (the RTS of  Vika) (we  intended  to  include  more UNITs  such as VCRE UNIT, but  failed due  to  time limitation). All of  the UNITs  in circuit 2 contain a NLS (Nuclear localization sequence) at the beginning of the protein and a terminator at the end.
      The highlight of this circuit is its  cell-cycle  dependent  promoter. After  studying publications [10] [11] [12] [13] about cell-cycle dependent promoters, we selected three promoters of pCyclinE (G1), pKi67(G1) and pCDK4(G1/S).  Cdk4, CCNE and Ki-67 are  cell  proliferation  markers, which  tightly  associate  with maintenance and regulation of the cell division. These proteins are present during all active  phases of the cell cycle (G1, S, G2, and mitosis), but are  absent from resting cells (G0). Their promoters contain multiple  transcription  factor   binding   sites .The  extracellular  signals  functions   through  the  signal transduction  pathways  converging at the  binding  sites to  active or inhibit the promoters activity and regulate the cell cycle  progression. Different signal  transduction pathways  regulate the  promoters at different time to  get the correct  cell  cycle  switch. In our project, we exploit  the synchronism betweenthese promoters  and  cell  cycle to  regulate  the  expression of  our target genes, which enables us to count the cell-cycles one by one.With the cell-cycle dependent promoter, genes can be only translated during the G1 state  of the  cell-cycle. Confirmed  by our last year’s researches, the recombinase need to  accumulate  to  a  certain  concentration  to  work, and G1  state  is  only  long  enough  for  one recombinase to work.
Figure 3. Concept map of REPORTER CIRCUIT
      REPORTER CIRCUIT is the florescence circuit with lined up SNAP UNIT and florescence UNITs. The SNAP UNIT is same with that  in circuit 2. The florescence UNITs include mCHERRY UNIT and CYAN UNIT. The florescence UNITs are similar in design with the recombinase UNITs, replacing NLSwith degradation tag DBOX but for the CYAN UNIT(we intended to include more UNITs such as GFP UNIT, but failed due to time limitation) which is just a plain CYAN. The promoter in circuit 3 is the constitutive promoter pEF1α.
Figure 4. Concept map of how Cyclebow system works
      When  three  circuits  are all  inserted  into cells, the  only  protein that will be express is SNAP-tag, which  is   imperceptible. Therefore   our  cells   will   be “grey”  during  their  first  cell-cycle. When STARTER CIRCUIT  is  induced  and Cre is  expressed, the SNAP UNIT in COUNTER CIRCUIT  and REPORTER CIRCUIT will  be cut out as it is flanked by  same oriented  LoxPs. Vika will not express right away as the promoter has to wait  till G1 to function, but mCherry will express, so  the cells will present  red  florescence. As  the  red  colored  cells  proceed  to their second  cell-cycle, Vika  will express and the VIKA UNIT as well as the mCHERRY  UNIT will be cut out. Cells turn blue as CYAN begins expressing and since  there is no more UNITs, cells  after  this will all be blue. For  illustration convenience and due to time limitation, our  design  only contained two UNITs in COUNTER CIRCUIT, and  three UNITs in  REPORTER CIRCUIT, which  can distinguish cells  that  underwent 2 cell cycles. By adding more UNITs of different recombinases and different colors, we can distinguish more.
Circuit Construction
      UNITs with  tags  and  RTSs  are  constructed  using PCR  and  oligonucleotide  ligation by  the following  procedure. Our vector is pEntry which  contains  attL1 and attL2 site for recombination into eukaryotic expressing vectors.
Figure 5. Three steps to construct our UNITs using PCR and oligonucleotide ligation
      Our UNITs all contain XbaI and SpeI enzyme sites, so we can easily line up the UNITs  using 3A assembly.  After  completion  of  the  circuit, we   recombine  our  circuit   from  pEnty  into  eukaryotic expressing vectors which also contain Lenti Virus parts for  stable transfection. We need three  circuits in total, therefore we need three eukaryotic expressing vectors with different anti-biotic resistance. We chose Puromycin, Neomycin and Hygromycin.
      Since we don’t have a eukaryotic expressing vector that  contains  cell-cycle  dependent  promoter, we have to reconstruction a vector  by exchanging  its  constitutive promoter  into  our G1 state promoters.
Tests on immortalized cell lines
      Our project is closely related to the  cell  cycle, so confirming the  cell  cycle of Hela, MCF7  and A-549 cell line is vital. The method we use is: double thymidine block, collect cells every 2 hours  after releasing, dye DNA with PI and run samples with the flow cytometry.
      Before  constructing  the  circuits, we  need  to confirm  whether  the  G1  state   promoters  we  obtained has an  average  promoter  function. We  ligate a GFP after our promoters, and  transient transfect the vector into 293T cells, and detect the  green  light. If green light can  be detected, we can  confirm the function of our promoters. After this, we can proceed the circuit construction, otherwise we will have to select new promoters first.
      Moreover, whether the selected G1 state promoters only function at G1 state needs to be confirmed. We construct stable cell lines of G1 state promoter vector with SNAP UNIT for the confirmation. After double thymidine block and releasing (when the majority of cells will be in the G1/S state), we block the previous SNAP tags so that they could not labelled, and collect cells at certain time points, dye with PI and SNAP-Cell 505-Star® and run samples with the flow cytometry. We expect the SNAP signal in consistence with the G1 state signal, representing that the selected G1 state promoters indeed only function at G1 state.
      Since other parts we use (recombinases, fluorescences, tags etc.) come from either our previous project or the laboratory, which are all confirmed of function, there will be no need to conduct tests on them.
      In order to gain results that has statistical significance, we decide to combine Cyclebow with thymidine block which can regulate the cells’ division activity. We intend to add Dox after the first block, so that the cells will turn red during the second block, and then turn blue after the second release. Therefore we need to confirm that the majority of cells will be blocked at G1/S after first blocking, and Dox inducing for 16 hours is enough for Cre to express. We use flow cytometry and Western Blot to confirm these two premises.
Cyclebow Construction
      OThe STARTER CIRCUIT serves as the switch of the whole system, therefore its construction deserves the priority. We use Lenti Virus to construct the stable cell lines of STARTER CIRCUIT in Hela, MCF7 and A-549 cell line. The vector of the STARTER CIRCUIT contains Neomycin resistance, so we use G418 to screen the cells. After the screening period, we add Doxycycline, and RT-PCR is conducted to confirm the expression of Cre.
      Before  constructing  the  circuits, we  need  to confirm  whether  the  G1  state   promoters  we  obtained has an  average  promoter  function. We  ligate a GFP after our promoters, and  transient transfect the vector into 293T cells, and detect the  green  light. If green light can  be detected, we can  confirm the function of our promoters. After this, we can proceed the circuit construction, otherwise we will have to select new promoters first.
      Moreover, whether the selected G1 state promoters only function at G1 state needs to be confirmed. We construct stable cell lines of G1 state promoter vector with SNAP UNIT for the confirmation. After double thymidine block and releasing (when the majority of cells will be in the G2 state), we block the previous SNAP tags so that they could not labelled, and collect cells every 2 hours, dye with PI and SNAP-Cell 505-Star® and run samples with the flow cytometry. We expect the SNAP signal in consistence with the G1 state signal, representing that the selected G1 state promoters indeed only function at G1 state.
