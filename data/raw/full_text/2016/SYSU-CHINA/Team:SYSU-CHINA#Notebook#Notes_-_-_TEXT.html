CCiC notes
       From September 2rd to 4th, jointly  organized  by iGEM-SYSU-CHINA  and iGEM-SYSU-Software, Sun Yat-sen University Central China iGEM Consortium was solemnly held in Hedanqing Lecture Hall. 28 iGEM teams across the country and couples of  professors from School of Life sciences for  a total of 230 people participated in this consortium. And here are the steps that we have taken :
