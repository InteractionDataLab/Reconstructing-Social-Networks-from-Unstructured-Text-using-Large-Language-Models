Inspirations
2015 SYSU_CHINA
     Last  year, we  develop  a  plug-in for  microbes, a  system that  can build  up  an internal  clock  for microbes  and  guide  them to  live regularly  as  well  as to work  efficiently. Also, we  could  insert  this system  into  dangerous  strains  and  endue  life  span,  they  are  doomed  to die  before  causing any biohazard. Flip units based on recombinase  system  are introduced in our system. One flip unit is able to calculate a specific period of time, while several flip units form one time cycle. So, when we combine several time cycles together, a timer is constructed. Different flip unit assemblies create  distinctive  time cycles, forms different kinds of timers. We believe this system will be of great significance  to biological devices with time-related concepts.
     Although recombinase systems such as  cre-loxp are  being  flexibly  used  in  synthetic biology, we were  the  first  to  combine the system with the concept of "time". (Click here to learn more about 2015 SYSU_China’s project)
      This year, we introduced  this  innovation of  dynamic–recombinase-system into our new  project  of Cyclebow,  which  can  count  cell-cycles  in living cells  and  therefore  shed  light  on  many  unsolved scientific problems, especially stem cell therapy.
Brainbow
     Brainbow is a  system  that  randomly expresses  fluorescent  proteins  in  individual  cells of mouse nervous system, basing on recombinase systems. Enabling  individual  cells to have  distinctive colors, complex  cellular  structures  can  be easily  visualized. First published  in 2014 on Neuron [1] ,  Brainbow has developed in  its   techniques  (becoming more robust, or gaining more functions [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] )  as well as  been used in various model animals including zebra fish [7] and fruit fly.

     Brainbow inspired us in more ways than one. We were attracted by Brainbow’s colorful appearance when researching, after  which  we  took  a   close look  into  its  design. To  our  surprise, we found its design an old  acquaintance  of us, which  was the  recombinase  system. From  Brainbow, we got  the message  that it was possible to  line up  different parts in one DNA circuit and use recombinase to cut off one certain part, triggering the function of other parts.
      Indirectly, Brainbow also made it clear that it was not able to solve the problem of whether cells had successfully  undergone one cell-cycle (which is  what we usually  mean for cell division). And  here  is where our novelty lies: Brainbow can nearly solve any  problem  from the dimension of location, but we intend to focus on the dimension of time.
      In summary, our project aims to develop an induced-spontaneous, dynamic labelling system, and as it focus on cell-cycles, we named it Cyclebow.
Survey on Stem cell therapy
     Before deciding on our project, we carried out a survey to know about people’s opinions on stem cell therapy and whether our initial ideas would be meaningful. From the survey, we got the hint that people value the proliferation of stem cells a lot. This assured us that the majority of people had the same thought with us, and that our project would be meaningful if put into usage. Now we are in common ground with the public, we have the confidence to work on Cyclebow.
