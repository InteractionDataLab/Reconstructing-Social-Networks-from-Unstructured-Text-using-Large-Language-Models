Circuit Construction
     We used the method of PCR and oligonucleotide ligation to succeed the construction of our UNITs, including SNAP UNIT, VIKA UNIT and mCHERRY UNIT.

     As our UNITs all contain XbaI and  SpeI  enzyme  sites, we  used  3A  assembly  and  successfully obtained our COUNTER CIRCUIT which  consists of SNAP UNIT and VIKA UNIT, and our REPORTER CIRCUIT which consists of SNAP UNIT and mCHERRY UNIT.

     Our STARTER  CIRCUIT  was  constructed by LR reaction that  recombined recombinase Cre into the tet-on vector. Due to the complication of the tet-on system which is hard to adjust into the biobrick, and because we submitted Cre last year, this circuit has not contributed to our parts.
