You can read more on our <A href="https://2016.igem.org/Team:Newcastle/HP/Gold">Gold Human Practices page</A>.</P><P>For example, our original microbial fuel cell used yeast cells (<SPAN class="”species-name”"><I>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</I></SPAN>) as in the work at the University of Reading's  on which our fuel cells was based. After a conversation with Dr Simon Woods, Co-Director of the Policy, Ethics and Life Sciences Research Centre, we began to understand the ethical implications of using yeast cells. The main area of concern regarding yeast was a biosecurity issue, stemming from the fact that it is freely accessible to the public. This lead us to consider the consequences of people replicating our work, perhaps at home. This lead us to explore the <A href="https://diybio.org/safety/biosafety-resources/">resources of the DIY bio community</A>. Ultimately this had an impact on the design of our system and we chose to change from using yeast, to <EM>E. coli</EM> in our microbial to discourage the use of genetically modified yeast outside the lab.</P><P>When engaging people with our human practices thought experiment one of the issues that came up repeatedly was that bacteria, such as <SPAN class="”species-name”"><EM>E. coli</EM> and other microorganisms are not afforded the same status as other animals. In further discussion we established that people's attitudes to bacteria are similar to that of plants. We then highlighted that even for plants we still have some responsibilities, for example preventing deforestation and so on. It was observed that these responsibilities are different from the caring role we are supposed to have towards other animals and tend to be more environmental responsibilities. Thus, we were lead to consider the environmental impact of our work. We used this information and process to adapt our designs so that we will now supply information on how to remove the PDMS and associated recycling information alongside our kit.</SPAN></P></TD></TR><TR><TD><P>

During their work with porins the
                    Bielefeld team reported a problem of <A href="https://2013.igem.org/Team:Bielefeld-Germany/Project/Porins">reduced growth</A> of the <EM>E. coli</EM>
                    due to metabolic stress. To overcome this issue, we have changed their promoter to a pBAD promoter which is regulated by L-arabinose. This
                        allows replication stress to be reduced during the first part of the growth curve and for porin expression to be triggered later by the
                        addition of L_arabinose. Cells containing our device (both the novel porin and the equivalent to Bielefeld’s device) grow normally allowing induction when
                    the culture is established. <A href="http://parts.igem.org/wiki/index.php?title=Part:BBa_K1172501:Experience">We documented this use on the experience page</A> for <SPAN class="gene-name">oprF</SPAN> in the parts registry.

                    other heavy metals. We chose to characterise <EM>smtA</EM> by testing against Zinc. We were unable to find any Zinc tolerance in cells
                    containing this device, and suggest that teams working with this in future are cautious when moving beyond cadmium. We have <A href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K519010:Experience">documented this result in the parts registry.</A></P><P>

This illustrates the methodology by which the kit should be used. We showed that the electrical output from the miniature microbial fuel cell was consistent with that obtained during lab testing.
