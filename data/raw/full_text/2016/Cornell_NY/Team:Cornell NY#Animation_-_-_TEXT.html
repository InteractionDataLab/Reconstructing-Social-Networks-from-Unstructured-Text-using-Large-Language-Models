Module integration with Shell
The modules come together by aligning the notch on the top of one module with the opening of an L-shaped groove on the bottom of another module. A radial channel allows for a twist-lock mechanism to secure the modules together.
Module components
Iodine Applicator: Squeezing the arms of the applicator together closes two iodine-soaked sponges together onto the cow’s teat. A spring pulls the arm back to its resting position.
Thermometer: The thermometer arm is at its resting position at maximum extension. A spring allows it to move down in response to small pressure from the cow’s udder so that there is no discomfort from this component.
