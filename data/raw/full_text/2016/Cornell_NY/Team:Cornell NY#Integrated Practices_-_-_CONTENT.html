In order to facilitate the development of our novel ideas, we have spent each stage of our project visiting and interacting with experts in the field, making decisions carefully with the feedback of current dairy farmers in mind. We approached the project with human-centered design in three stages [1]. First, <B>inspiration</B>. We derived our ideas from what was needed in the mastitis industry. Next, <B>ideation</B>. We sketched out prototypes and brought them to the farmer. And finally, <B>implementation</B>. We created our product. And at this stage, we knew that what we had created would be useful, because it was, in essence, the farmer, who had directed us throughout the process.

He informed us about the methods that he uses to prevent and treat bovine mastitis, and showed us the instruments used to inject antibiotics into a cow. After our talk with Charles, we decided that mastitis prevention efforts were more important during the milking period than during the dry period.

Our wet lab team started work on a bacteriocin treatment, choosing genes based on Dr. Nydam's advice. Our product development team concentrated on prevention, and narrowed their ideas down to a multi-purpose milking shell with different modules: an automatic post-dip disinfectant, a flow rate sensor, a cold shock, a temperature sensor, and a UV sterilizer. Our CS/ECE subteam focused on the detection of mastitis and created an app with several features including: a resource for symptoms, a somatic cell counter with a microscope attachment, a data analysis section, and a cost calculator. We brought these concepts to experts in the ideation phase to get feedback and constantly improve our designs.<B>QUESTION:</B> What do you like and what would you change about our product? <B>FINDINGS:</B> Experts were receptive to bacteriocins and had no problem with the safety of it. The temperature sensor, UV light, iodine spray, and cold shock were all seen as important modules, but not all farmers wanted all of the modules. The flow sensor was not needed, and the app was most useful on big farms that use traditional milking processes.

We talked to Blane Murray, who told us that our idea as a whole was valuable because it includes a preventative measure for bovine mastitis.

Blane said that our app would be more useful for bigger and more technologically advanced farms, and referred us to two more farms we could speak to.

Dr. Nydam lent us a field guide for bovine mastitis that gave us a solid foundation of how we should move forward with bacteriocin testing, and agreed to provide us with infected milk samples that we could use as test targets. We asked Dr. Nydam how we would know if our product was successful. He answered that <B>if we could show that bacteriocins work better than antibiotics, then it could be a home run.</B></P><P class="lead" style="color:black">For our milking shell, Dr. Nydam liked the iodine spray, UV light, and cold shock modules. He did not think the temperature sensor or the flow sensor were necessary as they were already implemented in farms, or were not good indicators for prevention. He mentioned that the iodine spray module would contaminate the milk if we kept it at the top of the shell. He was particularly interested in the cold shock module for its innovation, but suggested that we talk to more experts to see whether cold shock would be physiologically effective.</P><P class="lead" style="color:black">We also spoke to Dr. Nydam about our app. He recommended some academic literature that would help us with the economic analysis of treating or culling a cow.

While there are tests like the California Mastitis Test that already allow farmers to quickly detect mastitis, this new innovation could change the way the disease is approached and dealt with by farmers.</P><P class="lead" style="color:black">Dr. Nydam praised us for choosing a project in the dairy industry because of the strong agricultural presence in New York, along with the connections that Cornell has.

We spoke to Bill Kilcer, the owner. Robot farms require very little human interaction - cows step into the machine as they need to, and sensors detect the teats before latching on. We watched the process and noticed that the iodine spray was automatically sprayed after milking, unlike other farms where a person had applied it manually. Bill told us that our ideas of having a temperature sensor and iodine spray built into the shell were already incorporated into the robots. He also said that our app would not be helpful for him because all the metrics that the milk samples are tested for, such as conductivity, temperature, and amount of fat and protein, are already stored in a computer. In addition, there was no need for CowMD since most of the farmers do not need information about symptoms.

We changed the iodine spray module to a sponge applicator, since a spray could potentially contaminate the milk. We finished more of our app and updated the designs based on the feedback. We got rid of CowMD since farmers did not find it useful. We also modified cow data to show overall trends of the farm rather than focus individual cows, as DairyOne suggested. Finally, we polished our somatic cell counter designs to present a more user-friendly interface. We continued working on cloning bacteriocins in wet lab, in response to positive feedback.

He supported iodine application through sponges and UV exposure between milkings, because they would prevent growth and transfer of bacteria. Bill told us that he and other farmers would invest in a new device that would decrease the incidence of mastitis. Usually, shells are a one-time purchase and are only replaced when there is a better product in the market. <B>Currently, shells cost about $40-$50, but Morgan said he would spend $100-$200 for what we were offering, which would still be less than some other products on the market.</B> Each case of bovine mastitis can cost up to $300, and permanently damages infected cows so that they produce 10% less milk for the remainder of their milking years, causing additional losses on top of the initial $300 cost. Since farmers can identify the strains of bacteria that cause each case of mastitis on the farm using a special culture plate, choosing a specific bacteriocin for treatment is more precise than the traditional broad-range antibiotic cocktail. Bill also said that the microscope and app we were designing would be more convenient than current management techniques for bovine mastitis.</P></DIV></DIV></LI></UL><CENTER><H1 style="padding-top:150px;padding-bottom:130px;padding-left:50px;font-size:105%">7 months and 13 interviews later, we turned inspiration into Legendairy results.<B>FINDINGS:</B> Our dream of curing, preventing, and detecting mastitis can become a reality.
