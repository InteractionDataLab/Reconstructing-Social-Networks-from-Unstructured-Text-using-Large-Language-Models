A novel bacteriocin treatment for bovine mastitis
About Our Project
We developed our project through the eyes of dairy farmers. Our dream is that one day mastitis will be cured. By modifying the treatment and milking process, we can help eradicate a disease that has evolved and resisted drugs throughout the ages.                                 Through a comprehensive treatment that targets pathogens utilizing a synthetic biology approach, a customizable shell with prevention modules, and a user-friendly app for farmers, we believe we’ve done just that.
Time for mastitis to moo-ve over and out.
"Milk pays the bills"
"Mastitis is an inevitable disease"
“We try to manage that risk every day”
"It could be a home run"
“We need to get people to try to understand where our food comes from"
"It's a neat idea"
Wetlab
We genetically engineered E. coli to produce 13 different bacteriocins to target common and historically significant pathogens of mastitis with greater specificity than traditional antibiotics.

Product Development
We created a multi-functional nozzle with interchangeable parts to assist the farmer in prevention, detection, and treatment. Choose between an iodine module, UV lights, a temperature sensor, a cold shock module, and a syringe applicator, or have them all!

CS/ECE
We designed an app with a somatic cell counter through a microscope attachment, a cost calculator, and a data input function, so that you can start preventing mastitis wherever you are.

Policy & Practices
We collaborated with over 13 dairy farms, companies, and experts at every stage of our project - brainstorming, tailoring our sketches, and finally bringing our product to life.
SEE WHERE WE'VE BEEN
Public Engagement
We took our project to the Great New York State Fair, the Sciencenter, campus events, and to 4-H youth to raise awareness about mastitis and synthetic biology. More so, we engaged with the public and asked them what they thought. Because your opinion matters.

Business
We wrote a business plan that lays the foundation for our marketable product to be translated into a start-up.
