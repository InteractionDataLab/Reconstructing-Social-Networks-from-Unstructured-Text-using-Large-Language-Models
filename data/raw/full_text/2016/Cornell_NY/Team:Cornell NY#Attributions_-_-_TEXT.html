Cornell iGEM’s Legendairy would not have been possible without the guidance and support of our many advisors and organizations that we have worked with.
Our wet lab research was conducted in the Cornell Biomedical Instructional lab directed by Dr. Shivaun Archer. Dr. Archer provided us with all the necessary equipments including a gel imaging station, sterile hood, centrifuges, thermal-cyclers, and vortexes. She also oversaw lab safety and trained new members on lab safety measures.
We would like to thank Dr. Jan Lammerding for advising our team and letting us use facilities in his lab for protein purification.
We also extend our gratitude to Professor Chris Fromme, who provided significant amounts of reagents and equipments for protein purification that made our project possible, and to Professor Warren Zipfel, who provided us with our expression chassis and equipments for analyzing proteins.
Special thanks to Aravind Natarajan for providing us with crucial feedback in the problem solving process in the lab.
Thank you to Erika Ganda, who made our team more aware of cases of mastitis caused by gram negative bacteria. In addition, she provided us with relevant literature and around 40 species/strains of pathogens that have been isolated from cases of mastitis.
Professor Daryl Nydam from Quality Milk Production Services provided very helpful insight into the etiology of mastitis and provided advice about our approach and development of our project. Professor Anja Sipka, also from Quality Milk Production Services, provided us with milk samples containing common pathogens of bovine mastitis.
Blane Murray from Muranda Cheese Farm, Snofarm, Bill Morgan from Scipio Springs Dairy, Bill Kilcer from Windstott, John Tauzel and James Zimmerman from Dairy One, Tom Votny from Milkrite, Caroline Potter and Rob Lynch from ProDairy, Daryl Nydam from Quality Milk Production Services, and Dr. Gary Neubauer from Zoetis helped us learn about the dairy industry and gave us feedback for dry lab’s milking shell.
Alexa Maille provided us opportunities to speak to the public about synthetic biology by including us in the 4H-Career Exploration program and in the New York State Fair.    Ali Jackson invited us to participate in a program held by the Ithaca Science Center to engage the public in conversations about synthetic biology.
Nichole Nease gave us the opportunity to spark interest in science in young children by letting us mentor them over the summer.
In addition, we would like to thank Rebecca MacDonald for helping us with team organization and business relations, and Cornell’s College of Engineering for providing us the platform to participate in iGEM.
