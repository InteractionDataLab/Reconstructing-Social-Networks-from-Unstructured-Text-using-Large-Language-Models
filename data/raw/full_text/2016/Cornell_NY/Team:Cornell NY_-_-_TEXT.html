A novel bacteriocin treatment for bovine mastitis
About Our Project
We developed our project through the eyes of dairy farmers, with whom we share the endeavor to cure bovine mastitis. By modifying the mastitis treatment and cow milking processes, we can help eradicate a disease that has evolved and resisted drugs throughout the ages. Through our three pronged approach, we believe that we’ve done just that. Time for mastitis to moo-ve over and out.
Treatment
We target the most common bovine mastitis-causing pathogens with a panel of specific bacteriocin-derived treatments.
Prevention
Our system minimizes bacterial infection through our customizable preventative milking shell.
Detection
Our system enables early detection with a mobile cow-side somatic cell counter microscope and data-logging smartphone app for farmer.
"Milk pays the bills"
"Mastitis is an inevitable disease"
“We try to manage that risk every day”
"It could be a home run"
“We need to get people to try to understand where our food comes from"
"It's a neat idea"
Udder Defense
We genetically engineered E. coli to produce 13 different bacteriocins to target common and historically significant mastitis-causing pathogens with greater specificity than traditional antibiotics.

The Milky Way
We created a novel, modular, customizable milking machine shell to prevent bacteria from infecting the cow. With automatic post-dip, UV sterilization, temperature detection, and cold shock functionalities to choose from, the options are limitless when it comes to preventing bovine mastitis.
CHECK IT OUT
Cowscope
We designed an app with a somatic cell counter through a microscope attachment, a cost calculator, and a data input function, for early and efficient bovine mastitis detection.

Policy & Practices
We collaborated with over a dozen dairy farms, companies, and experts at every stage of our project - from brainstorming and tailoring our sketches to finally bringing our product to life.
SEE WHERE WE'VE BEEN
Public Engagement
We took our project to the Great New York State Fair, the Sciencenter, campus events, and 4-H youth to raise awareness about bovine mastitis and synthetic biology. More so, we engaged with the public and asked them what they thought. Because your opinion matters.

Business
We wrote a business plan that lays the foundation for our marketable product to be translated into a start-up.
