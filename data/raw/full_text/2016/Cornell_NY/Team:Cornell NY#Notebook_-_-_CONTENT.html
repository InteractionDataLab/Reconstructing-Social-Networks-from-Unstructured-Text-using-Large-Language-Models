We visited Snofarm, and the owner of the farm walked us through and showed us the milking process, and we learned that the most intensive part of mastitis was disease prevention, so the cows and their environment must be kept very clean.
We reached out to Dr. Neubauer, who is the president of the National Mastitis Council as well as part of Zoetis, one of the world’s largest pharmaceutical companies that develops medicine and vaccination for animals, and he was able to point our product development team in the right direction for our milking device design.
We visited the Vet Dairy Teaching Barn, which is close to campus, and after talking to Charles, one of the employees, we were inspired to develop a prototype that would assist during the milking period and help with detecting mastitis.

He thought that our idea as a whole was valuable because it is a preventative measure for mastitis, and he emphasized that the most important aspect of marketing our product to farmers would be its cost effectiveness. In addition, he pointed us to a few bigger and more technologically advanced farms that we would later visit. 
We visited Daryl Nydam of Quality Milk Production Services again, and he gave us feedback on the various aspects of our project - bacteriocins, milking shell, and the app - and gave us infected milk samples so that we could test our bacteriocins. With more feedback in hand, we worked on modifying our modules and app and did more testing on our bacteriocins.

We visited Windstott Farm, a robot farm that Blane Murray had referred us to, and Bill Kilcer showed us how the robotic milking machines worked. Through our talk with Bill, we found that our project would be most helpful for bigger traditional dairy farms.
We reached out to Bill Morgan, who looks over the operations of Scipio Springs Dairy, and he was very interested in implementing bacteriocins on his farm and in the UV light and temperature sensor modules of the milking shell. 
We spoke with John Tauzel, John Gloss, and George Cudoc of Dairy One, a dairy data management company that helps farmers in making decisions on their farms. They provided us with feedback on our Somatic Cell Counter idea as well as the cost calculator.

We also once again visited Bill Morgan of Scipio Springs Dairy would gave us praise for certain components of our milking shell as well as insight on how to improve the technical details. He further explained how much the cost of mastitis is, and how much he would be willing to pay for the various parts of our project.

We machined the temperature sensor mechanism and the top part of the shell.
