We seized some of our most unique outreach opportunities yet this past year, working with a science museum, educating underprivileged youth, and being put on a public stage at the Great New York State Fair. We aimed not to demonstrate but to engage, having conversations about mastitis and synthetic biology. </P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></SECTION><SECTION id="synbio" class="cd-section" style="padding:96px 0;background-color:white;"><DIV class="container"><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-sm-12"><H3 class="uppercase color-primary mb40 mb-xs-24" style="margin-bottom: 40px;"><CENTER>Humans and SynBio</CENTER></H3><DIV class="row text-center"><DIV class="col-sm-8"><P class="lead mb40" style="color:black;font-size:20px;"><CENTER style="font-family: 'Open Sans', 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;font-size:25px;">“What is synthetic biology to you?”</CENTER></P><P class="lead mb40" style="color:black;"><CENTER style="font-family: 'Open Sans', 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">Here’s what they told us.</CENTER></P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></SECTION><SECTION id="fair" class="cd-section" style="padding:96px 0;background-color:rgba(245, 245, 245, 0.45);"><DIV class="container-fluid"><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-sm-12"><H3 class="uppercase color-primary mb40 mb-xs-24" style="margin-bottom: 40px;"><CENTER>The Great NY State Fair</CENTER></H3></DIV></DIV><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-sm-5"><P class="lead mb40" style="color:black;">1 million people. The Great NY State Fair is called great for a reason--it sees a huge influx of people every summer. New York State is one of the top five agricultural producers in the country, and so agriculture is rightfully showcased at the fair. The fair served not only as a place where we could raise awareness about synthetic biology, but also, in light of the agricultural focus, the perfect field to showcase our mastitis project.</P><P class="lead mb40" style="color:black;">We were stationed at a booth near the Youth Building, one of the main attractions for youth and their parents at the fair. As people came through--people from all over New York, Pennsylvania, and other neighboring states--we engaged them with an activity from Building with Biology, an initiative funded by the National Science Foundation.</P><P class="lead mb40" style="color:black;">The activity, called the “Kit of Parts,” illustrated synthetic biology as a way to put different pieces together to solve a problem. After the activity, we asked them to participate in our photo campaign known as “Humans and SynBio”, inspired by Humans of New York.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></SECTION><SECTION id="4h" class="cd-section" style="padding:96px 0;background-color:white;"><DIV class="container-fluid"><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-sm-12"><H3 class="uppercase color-primary mb40 mb-xs-24" style="margin-bottom: 68px;"><CENTER>4-H Career Explorations Conference</CENTER></H3></DIV></DIV><DIV class="row" style="margin-bottom: 50px;"><DIV class="col-sm-10"><P class="lead mb40">Along with mentoring elementary school students in synthetic biology through the YOURS Mentorship Program, our team also worked with 8th graders who participated in the 4-H Career Explorations Conference. The purpose of this conference is to help middle schoolers explore their interests in different career paths, and the theme for this year’s conference was entrepreneurship. Our workshops aimed to introduce the concept of synthetic biology, to bridge the gap between synthetic biology and entrepreneurship, and to foster collaboration among students in order to solve a problem together.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="row" style="margin-bottom: 50px;"><DIV class="col-sm-5"><P class="lead mb40" style="color:black;">Many of the students in our workshops were not exposed to most of these concepts, let alone entrepreneurship in the context of synthetic biology. However, within the span of a 90-minute workshop of brainstorming and asking questions to help them further their ideas, they were able to grasp the idea of how a science-related idea can be turned into a product that could be brought to market. The 8th graders’ creativity and imagination came to the fore as they delivered their pitches for their products, and while we guided them in turning an idea involving synthetic biology to one related to business, they taught us that the possibilities of joining synthetic biology and entrepreneurship together are endless.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-sm-10"><P class="lead mb40" style="color:black;">The prompt for each of our workshops was the following:</P><P class="lead mb40" style="color:black;"><I>You are a group of entrepreneurs at a company. The wet lab team has engineered bacteria that can remove carbon dioxide from the air. Think of a business idea that will implement these bacteria in the real world and deliver a 5 minute pitch.</I></P><UL class="list-unstyled" style="font-family: 'Open Sans', 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;margin-bottom:20px;"><LI><I>Your pitch should answer all, if not more, of the following:</I></LI><LI><I>• What does your device do?</I></LI><LI><I>• How is it different from existing devices?

We wanted to help instill a love of science in the children of our local community at Cornell. We partnered with the 4H Dryden OURS (Opportunity, Understanding, Respect, Success) program of Tompkins County, run by Cornell Cooperative Extension, and participated in the YOURS (Youth Outreach Undergraduates Reshaping Success) program. The children we worked with were from mobile park homes in nearby Freeville, New York. They were between 8 and 11 years old and chose to participate in the program because they wanted to learn more about science.
</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="row" style="margin-bottom:90px;"><DIV class="col-sm-5"><P class="lead mb40" style="color:black;">The goal of our program was simple: to make biology and engineering fun while teaching about our project dealing with mastitis. For 6 weeks, students visited our classroom and lab space at Cornell for 2 hours. They were taught concepts in science through visuals and hands-on demonstrations. Every class included activities and experiments in which the students applied their new knowledge, seeing the power of science in action. We emphasized the ideology of learning through doing. Each student was paired with a mentor who was part of the Cornell iGEM team. This personal connection made students’ experiences with science all the more meaningful. </P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="row "><DIV class="col-sm-10"><TABLE class="tg" style="font-family: 'Open Sans', 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><TBODY><TR><TH class="tg-yw4l">Week</TH><TH class="tg-yw4l">Lesson Plan</TH></TR><TR><TD class="tg-yw4l">1</TD><TD class="tg-yw4l">To begin, we gave students a survey to gauge their interests and previous knowledge. We then gave them an introduction to the science of biology and the concept of genetic engineering. We introduced how our team works in the field of synthetic biology, and subsequently introduced our project dealing with mastitis. After we talked about the importance of measurements in scientific experiments, the students measured out water and food coloring using graduated cylinders and micropipettes. Throughout, the students gained an understanding of the properties of water that cause a meniscus to form. They learned how to properly label a tube with necessary information.</TD></TR><TR><TD class="tg-yw4l">2 </TD><TD class="tg-yw4l">In this lesson we talked about DNA. Students created drawings of the double-helix structure of DNA, and then extracted DNA from strawberries. During the DNA extraction, the students also learned about emulsifiers and the role of soap in the experiment. They learned why DNA is called the blueprint for the body and how iGEM uses different techniques to change DNA to achieve our goal. After protein was extracted from both regular milk and soy milk, the structure and function of the protein in the body were discussed.</TD></TR><TR><TD class="tg-yw4l">3</TD><TD class="tg-yw4l">The purpose of this week’s lesson was to learn about the separation of molecules. We extracted the colors from different types of candy and permanent markers. Then students loaded a gel to separate the molecules using gel electrophoresis, and also performed paper chromatography on their samples. They learned why certain molecules move faster than others and hence separate. The concepts were reinforced with a modified game of tag with the mentors. The class ended with a demonstration of the Marangoni effect in water using soap, and floating a bread tie on water. This built on the previous week’s discussion of the properties of water, and this week the students learned more about surface tension.</TD></TR><TR><TD class="tg-yw4l">4</TD><TD class="tg-yw4l">We moved from a biology focus to talk about engineering, since that is a big part of what our team does. This week the students created a contraption to allow an egg to survive 20-foot, 40-foot, and 60-foot drops. Before starting, we discussed Newton’s three laws of motion and why the egg broke when it fell. This gave the students a scientific basis on which they could build an approach for saving the egg. Students went through the process of identifying a problem, brainstorming solutions, designing a concept, budgeting materials (through a point system), building under timed conditions, and testing a prototype. The act of deliberately using logic to solve a problem was emphasized. The students enjoyed creating physical models of their ideas. The activity was followed by a discussion of how iGEM uses engineering concepts to tackle biology-related issues.</TD></TR><TR><TD class="tg-yw4l">5</TD><TD class="tg-yw4l">This week we wanted to showcase our project’s impact and connection to the real world. We brought the children and mentors to Cornell’s Vet Dairy Teaching Barn and were given a tour of the facility by the director. Students were able to see and pet the cows and learn about milk production and processing. They also saw the milking process take place and the tanks where the milk is stored. They learned about milking and dry periods, and the different types of feed and antibiotics, and met baby calves. There was a discussion of mastitis and how it affects cows as well as milk production at a farm. We talked about how iGEM was going to tackle the problem in a multifaceted approach, using bacteriocins, a new milking shell, and an app for farmers.</TD></TR><TR><TD class="tg-yw4l">6</TD><TD class="tg-yw4l">To further the children’s understanding of the dairy industry, this week we visited,the Cornell Dairy Bar, an on-campus ice creamery that serves dairy products made from milk produced at the Dairy Learning Barn. The students got to see the facility where the ice cream is made, which was full of interactive displays and videos to learn from. The students then enjoyed ice cream from the Dairy Bar, amazed with the understanding that the ice cream was made from the same milk they saw the previous week. We finished the program with one last fun experiment with chemical reactions. Students saw the reaction between vinegar and baking soda, and then tried to capture the chemical energy released as mechanical energy by blowing up balloons with the reaction. They tinkered with different set-ups and amounts of reactants. Students enjoyed using logic and the understanding of the reaction to figure out how to get the largest balloons. The YOURS program ended with a fun game of tag with the mentors and superlative awards for all of the students.</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></DIV></DIV></SECTION><SECTION id="extra" class="cd-section" style="padding:96px 0;background-color:white;"><DIV class="container-fluid"><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-sm-12"><H3 class="uppercase color-primary mb40 mb-xs-24" style="margin-bottom: 80px;"><CENTER>Sciencenter</CENTER></H3></DIV></DIV><DIV class="row" style="margin-bottom:95px;"><DIV class="col-sm-5"><P class="lead mb40" style="color:black;">Building with Biology is a project which provides activities that nurture conversations about synthetic biology. 200 kits were awarded to museums and organizations across the country, and the Cornell iGEM team received one of them!
