Xylitol
Why we chose to develop a model of the Xylitol pathway.
We chose to model the Xylitol pathway as it is impossible to intuit the combination of parameters that will cause oscillation, but this can be done with modelling

Overview of the model.
In the pathway, D-arabinose activates the pBAD/AraC promoter causing production of GRE and cl, these inhibit the T7/cl promoter under which are genes for the production of arabinose (figure 1). We have modelled this as a cycle with one activation and one repression step (figure 2). The activation step representing the activation of pBAD/AraC, the repression step encompasses the GRE/cl inhibiting T7/cl promoter and this effect of the production of arabinose through the genes under the promoter. Additionally, we included in our model production and degradation of arabinose and GRE. Using parameter scan function in Simbiology, we found that with certain parameter values the levels of arabinose started to oscillate.
