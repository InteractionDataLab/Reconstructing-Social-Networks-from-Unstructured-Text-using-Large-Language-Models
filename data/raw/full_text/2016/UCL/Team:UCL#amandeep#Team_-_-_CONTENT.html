Really into entrepreneurship and everything creative but also enjoy the occasional visit to the lab. I have a talent of pushing people's buttons and using that to my own entertainment. Love yoga, pilates, matcha lattes and GMO cheeseballs. Master of iGEM rules and Deadlines and life in general. #hashtag </P></DIV><DIV class="column full_size"><DIV class="highlight"><H5>Amandeep</H5><P>Being one of the youngest members of the iGEM team, I’m the perfect guinea pig for our healthy ageing project! Currently in my second year of a Biochemical engineering MEng degree and I love looking for new challenges, being inspired by synthetic biology and popcorn filled movie nights. I wanted a summer packed full of fun, blood, sweat and tears and and iGEM fits the job perfectly!</P></DIV><DIV class="column full_size"><DIV class="highlight"><H5>Abbie</H5><P>I am a 4th year Biochemistry (MSci) student obsessed with antibodies, ageing and antibiotic resistance. Synthetic biology for me is a creative science and can be most powerful when combined with other fields like architecture, art or computer science. In iGEM I experiment in the lab and tell the world about it whether that is documenting our progress on social media or giving talks to students and the public. Aside from this I enjoy meeting and interacting with new people - whether that’s other iGEM teams or the public. Thus I hope to be able to bring the two together through organising events to engage everyone with synthetic biology! I am the early riser of the team and love waking up to sunrises. When not iGEM-ing you will see me dancing (or trying to), exploring new places and working as a student ambassador at UCL or shamelessly selling subscriptions to The Economist.  </P></DIV><DIV class="column full_size"><DIV class="highlight"><H5>Dale</H5><P>I’m a second year Biochemical Engineering student. My interest in synthetic biology stems from is it’s vast range of applications to solve real world problems. Hoping to spend the summer experimenting in the lab and striving towards HTML competency. </P></DIV><DIV class="column full_size"><DIV class="highlight"><H5>Jakub</H5><P>Third year Biochemical Engineering student. My interest in synthetic biology stems from its unlimited potential for improvement.  I hope to bring my lab experience into our iGEM team, along with some modelling and automation knowledge. Since I am keen on industrial bioprocessing, I am also going to work on the industrial aspects of our project, such as scale-up.  As for my non-biotech related interest, they range, among others, from economics to jazz music and cooking. </P></DIV><DIV class="column full_size"><DIV class="highlight"><H5>Neythen</H5><P> Just finished second year Natural Sciences, studying Physics and Molecular and Cell Biology. Synthetic biology appeals to me as a way to build complex systems from the bottom up and extend the function of natural organisms for our benefit. I have an interest in technology and hope to bring my self taught programming skills into our project. </P></DIV><DIV class="column full_size"><DIV class="highlight"><H5>Yuqiao Liu</H5><P> I come from Beijing. I love Science but my passion in science is presented in terms of philosophy. It is an amazing opportunity to be involved in iGEM within the UCL team as I'm working with people from different backgrounds. Orchestra, Opera, ballet and photography are my non-academic life and I enjoy cooking as well. Things change fast at my age. </P></DIV><DIV class="column full_size"><DIV class="highlight"><H5>Hana</H5><P>Finishing up my Masters in Biochemical Engineering, I’m keen to delve into the synbio startup world! I love all things ageing and will be working on the entrepreneurial aspects of our project this year. My biggest weakness is keeping a straight face with this crazy team! When I’m not busy with iGEM, I like to spend my time thinking up reasons for not going to the gym. </P></DIV><DIV class="column full_size"><DIV class="highlight"><H5>Kamil</H5><P> I just finished my second year of the cell and molecular biology stream within the Biomedical Sciences BSc degree program at UCL. I am intrigued by the multilevel complexity of living systems and how the understanding of their characteristics translates to the possibility to prolong human life and improve its quality. Consequently, my primary interest lies in the scientific basis of our project. I plan to pursue a science-based career and I hope that it will be, taking into account challenges associated with this type of work, a rewarding path with hopefully relevant consequences. </P></DIV><DIV class="column full_size"><DIV class="highlight"><H5>Michal</H5><P> Contrary to popular belief, studying Arts and Sciences does not mean that I’m drawing human bodies. Focusing mainly on science communication, my role in the team is to primarily put our topic into a wider context of the society. Having just finished my second year, I am keen on putting into practice what I have learned over the past few months. Besides studying, I am an avid reader of anything that was words, but most of the time I emerge myself in sci-fi or fantasy genre, which explains my addiction to manga. I also really enjoy playing sports, having run Floorball Club at UCL throughout the year.
 </P></DIV><DIV class="column full_size"><DIV class="highlight"><H5>Chineyere</H5><P> Aging is an inevitable part of life, ask Dorian Gray…. My name is Chinyere Ihuegbu (Chichi). I am finishing up my Masters in Biosciences. I enjoy life sciences, smiles and all things fun. When not in a lab coat, I try to learn the violin. I addition to science, I enjoy working with kids. </P></DIV><DIV class="column full_size"><DIV class="highlight"><H5>Jesus</H5><P> I am an MRes Synthetic Biology student, so joining the UCL iGEM team made sense, do not worry, there is not much sense left in my life.  Among my uncountable passions are colourful socks, good spoons and maps.  iGEM is one of them too, as it is the best chance to show, beyond a bunch of proud freaks, what Synthetic Biology is about, and at the same time participate in an ambitious and responsible project. Our amazing project is about aging and wellbeing, or how to stop the first and extend the later. Aging is a fascinating topic for me since my younger years; I used to punch the wall of my bedroom as a kid because I did not tolerate death as an unavoidable thing.  Maybe my approach has changed but not the energy. As a kid and even today I would never give a glance to a map of the world that does not include Utopia. </P></DIV><DIV class="column full_size"><DIV class="highlight"><H5> Enrique</H5><P> Full time MRes Synthetic Biology student and entrepreneur. Science and Technology are part of my life passions, alongside arts, films, martial arts, learning languages and travelling (There are too many, I know). Also, I truly believe that synthetic biology is dramatically changing how people will live their lives, and this particular project is proof of that. By tackling the downwards of senescence at molecular level, this team is setting the pace for new thing to come in iGEM, just as biosensors did in the early competitions. I never heard about iGEM until my final year of undergrad, and by that time I couldn’t join my school’s team. Now, I am proud of being part of the UCL iGEM team as an advisor and help this team in this project and I have to say that this team are amazing. </P></DIV><DIV class="column full_size"><DIV class="highlight"><H5>Kasia </H5></DIV><DIV class="column half_size"><H5>Inspiration</H5><P>You can look at what other teams did to get some inspiration!
