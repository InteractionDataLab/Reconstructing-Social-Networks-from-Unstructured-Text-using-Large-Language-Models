So we decided that we wanted to make some resources for young children about our project, synthetic biology and ideas around synthetic biology. We have this document translated in English, German, French, Farsi, Spanish and Mandarin. </P><P><A href="Ucligem_handbook.pdf">pdf file</A></P></DIV><DIV class="column full_size"><DIV class="highlight"><H1> Workshop with the younger generation </H1><P> We were able to inspire the next generation of scientists, engineers, conputer scientists and phycolgists through a workshop. We told them what synthetic biology is, our project, asked them what their perception of the elderly is and ran some fun activities. We also gave the students a chance to have some lab experience. </P><P> We asked the children to draw what they think of when I said AGEING </P>&lt;-- SLIDE SHOW (AMAN ADDED) --&gt;
<DIV class="w3-content w3-display-container" style="max-width:800px"><DIV class="w3-center w3-section w3-large w3-text-white w3-display-bottomleft" style="width:100%"><DIV class="w3-left w3-padding-left w3-hover-text-khaki" onclick="plusDivs(-1)">❮</DIV><DIV class="w3-right w3-padding-right w3-hover-text-khaki" onclick="plusDivs(1)">❯</DIV></DIV></DIV>&lt;-- SLIDESHOW ENDS --&gt;

<P> We then asked the children to draw what they envision themselves looking like when they are 65 years old (the age when you are considered as elderly) </P></DIV><DIV class="column full_size"><DIV class="highlight"><H1> Week long outreach workshops with year 12 students at the sutton trust summer school Monday 8th -12th July </H1></DIV><DIV class="column full_size"><DIV class="highlight"><H1> Outreach activity workshop with year 12 students at the sutton trust summer school Thursday 28th July </H1><H1>UCL iGEM does Outreach:</H1><P>Last Thursday Michelle, Amandeep &amp; Abbie presented to a group of year 12 students about synthetic biology, iGEM and ageing (and even got invited back to present later this month)! We encouraged discussion throughout the lecture and it was great to teach them a little bit too. </P>We then proceeded to have two debates: one focussing on ageing, another on synthetic biology.<P>The arguments were eloquent, well thought through and focussed on aspects such as the economic, ethical and even emotional impact of this research. The debate was particularly poignant at times and the students all had their own opinions which we encouraged the discussion of. We were not only impressed, but inspired by their enthusiasm and the feedback we received. Especially now some of the students want to get involved with iGEM and even study biochemical engineering- a degree they previously didn't know existed. </P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="column full_size"><DIV class="highlight"><H1> Outreach activity workshop with year 8 students at the sutton trust summer school Friday 29th July </H1><P>Friday was another day of presenting for us 3- this time to year 8 students - we gave them an insight into ageing in London and again encouraged participation.
After our talk we again set up a debate in which the students represented one of the following stakeholders:</P><P> 'Business person wanting to build a gym', 'scientist wanting to build an ageing research institution', 'doctor wanting to build a walk-in clinic' and 'the council wanting to build a community centre'. </P><P> Again, great arguments were constructed which considered the negatives of the other parties as well as the strengths of their own. They considered the different types of job prospects, ethics and short vs long term investments. We were particularly pleased with the vote outcome in which the students favoured a research institution to be built. </P></DIV><DIV class="column full_size"><DIV class="highlight"><H1> UCL iGEM x Sutton Trust summer school - biosciences stream </H1><P> This summer school is based at UCL and formed part of our outreach activities since it is aimed at students from widening participation backgrounds. Abbie worked closely with the students and lead a group of 5, year 12 students. </P><P> This involved demonstrating various lab activities from basic pipetting to performing restriction digests and running gel electrophoresis. We also performed an activity which looked at the bacteria on skin before and after washing hands, the effectiveness of chemicals on killing bacteria and even gram stained these, looking under them at a microscope. A lot of the experiments were new to the students so it was essential to explain the techniques and assist throughout. </P><P> It was also an opportunity to give advice about university and share our own personal experiences. </P><P> Amandeep and Abbie also gave a lecture on iGEM, synthetic biology and ageing. Afterwards we ran a workshop and debate with regards to synthetic biology and ageing research as before to the 30 students on the stream. We really enjoy this activity due to the consideration of ethics, economics and personal experiences. </P><P> Some highlights have been collated in the video.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
