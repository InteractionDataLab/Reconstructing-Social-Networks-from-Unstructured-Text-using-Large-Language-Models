Jason Blackstock
On the 6th of September 2016 we had a meeting with Dr Jason J Blackstock, who is head of Department of Science, Technology, Engineering and Public Policy at UCL. He has a background in physics and has since worked to connect the world of public policy and engagement to the world of science.
We started off by explaining our project and few main aspects of it, especially our ideas about oxidative stress and our potential SOD gene therapy. We then went on to talking about how the public generally reacts or would potentially react to our research of ageing and our potential products and solutions. He told us that the public is tremendously willing to try technologies that they know work but they do not trust experiments being done on them, hence he said the main barrier we would face would be in the medical sector rather than that of the public. The main thing we need to think about is testing and design pathways in accordance with regulation, which in such a fast growing sector is always changing. He also reiterated that, especially in North America and Europe, the government will not just let anything pass and thus once regulation has been approved the public will be willing to try this new and safe product.
Jason then explained to us the amounts of expenses associated with these regulatory pathways. Telling us that one important thing would be to find a drug or at least a drug delivery mechanism that is analogous to ours and learn from those drug trials and better our own product. He also enforced the importance of working with the regulators, as the more people are willing to work with them, the more they can embrace your ideas and what you are working on.  Along those lines he advised us to look into IP protection of our ideas as soon as possible, with the help of UCL, that can help us to decide what and how to protect.
We went on to ask him what he thought of our project in general, which he said he found interesting and innovative as well as having thought about the biochemical delivery methods to an ageing problem. We also brought up the controversial topic of GMOs and public policy, to which we were advised to not put those to words together in association with our research due to the bad reputation. As the general public perceive GMOs as usually crops, we do not have to associate our research in that manner, although in theory we are also changing the genes of organisms. Linking to that point he said that GMOs and the research we are doing, should be accepted over the long term as it is in the natural course of what is happening and most people might not even question it. Nonetheless there should always be public consultation about these sorts of issues.
Furthermore we inquired about the link between public policy, our project and politics. Jason told us that politicians nowadays are looking at the ‘grand challenges’, one of which is dealing with the ever-growing and expanding population of the elderly. Although this should not be our main concern, the work with regulatory systems should, further down the line when it is closer to a promising product, it will be discussed politically.
In connection to politics we also inquired about Brexit and its effect on public policy, to which he told us that Brexit hasn't really changed anything substantive, in terms of our project. It will change many things but not drug safety or the regulation process (i.e. the UK will not develop a regulatory system separate from the rest of the EU, as that would lead to continuity issues.) In terms of funding he said that there are bigger drivers changing the funding environment than Brexit and especially in terms of our project we are more likely to get industrial funding later on in the process than EU funding.
When inquiring about how much input religion has on science policy he told us that it does not influence day to day decisions but it does set a context in terms of “who we want to be as a species.” This in turn will then influence our ethical choices about what we should or should not do. Overall decisions for funding are mostly made on what the treasury thinks will make the economy better rather than religious input.
Overall Jasons main input was to deal with the IP issues as soon as possible to protect our idea and to consider what we want to do with our project as iGEM comes to an end.
David Eaton from the International Longevity Centre
In order to see how well Biosynthage fitted well into UK policies and how much impact on demographics, we met with Mr David Eaton – a policy and public affairs officer at the International Longevity centre UK (a charity focused on the elderly). The meeting with Mr Eaton was engaging and insightful. He prodded on certain areas on our project which we had not given much thought about, and showed us ways in which Biosynthage could have a positive impact on Britain’s policy. Areas such as having key stakeholder outreach and engagement, approaching members of parliaments, social media and the press, and economic projections were discussed with respect to Biosynthage.
Mr Eaton found our project to be “one of the first practical attempts to fulfil most of the works of Aubery De gray”, and “by helping with healthy life expectancy, could lead to possible savings on the NHS and pension works”.
Mr Eaton also provided us with a document detailing the process by which a real researcher would take to get their ageing research turned into an accepted product used by the public.
