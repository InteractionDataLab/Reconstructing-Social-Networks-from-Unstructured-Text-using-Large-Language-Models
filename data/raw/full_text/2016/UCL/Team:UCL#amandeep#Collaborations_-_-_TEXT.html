UCL iGEM 2016 Collaboration survey - Using twitter to get the public opinion on synthetic biology, with the help of some iGEM teams that helped by filling out the form and re tweeting the survey! The teams that collaborated with us were:
Imperial team
XMU-China
Edinburgh team
NRP-UEA iGEM team (Biowire)
Dundee Schools iGEM
Team LMU and TU Munich
Tianjin University team
Meet up with UK iGEM teams organised by Westminster - 18th - 19th August
We were able to present our project to the other UK teams and to also see what the other teams were doing such that we could organise a possible relevent collaboration. This meet up was very exciting and fun! Once our presentation was over, we asked the University of Westminster iGEM team to give us some feedback on our project. We received the following input:
We asked " What do you think of our project?"
You have a lot of sub-projects
When you mentioned that the project is to tackle ageing - it was confusing and not straight to the point
Communicate our project with some facts - how much of an issue is poor dental hygiene with the elderly
Change the wording of the project to make it more clearer (The objective of the project)
The feedback we received has really helped us rethink how we can present our project to the world in a better and clearer way. We now have a clear understanding that not everyone has the knowledge that we do about our project and the science behind it. Therefore it is essential that we receive feedback from people who were listening to our presentation and act upon it by making our presentation clearer and more easier to follow and understand.Through the iGEM project journey we have found out that its essential that we focus on clear communication of our project. Not only were we able to receive feedback on our project, but we also gave some feedback to some of the other teams. For example, we told the Westminster team that we loved their project and that they ---
Rice iGEM - Humans of synbio
Trinity iGEM team - UCL academy on youtube
Ask teams on twitter to help give feedback about the current software they are using to build their gene circuits. This can help us build our software (alphabrick) made for iGEM teams! We recieved feedback from:
ITU iGEM Team
iGEM UPO Sevilla
McMaster iGEM
Purdue iGEM

★  ALERT!
This page is used by the judges to evaluate your team for the team collaboration silver medal criterion .
Delete this box in order to be evaluated for this medal. See more information at Instructions for Evaluated Pages .
Sharing and collaboration are core values of iGEM. We encourage you to reach out and work with other teams on difficult problems that you can more easily solve together.
Which other teams can we work with?
You can work with any other team in the competition, including software, hardware, high school and other tracks. You can also work with non-iGEM research groups, but they do not count towards the iGEM team collaboration silver medal criterion.
In order to meet the silver medal criteria on helping another team, you must complete this page and detail the nature of your collaboration with another iGEM team.
Here are some suggestions for projects you could work on with other teams:
Improve the function of another team's BioBrick Part or Device
Characterize another team's part
Debug a construct
Model or simulating another team's system
Test another team's software
Help build and test another team's hardware project
Mentor a high-school team
