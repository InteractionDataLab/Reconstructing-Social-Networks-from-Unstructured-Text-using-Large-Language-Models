Regardless of the topic, iGEM projects often create or adapt computational tools to move the project                                 forward. Because they are born out of a direct practical need, these software tools (or new computational methods)                                 can be surprisingly useful for other teams. Without necessarily being big or complex, they can make the crucial                                 difference to a project's success. This award tries to find and honor such "nuggets" of computational work.
Inspiration
Here are a few examples from previous teams:
TU Munich 2013
Heidelberg 2014
Aachen 2014
Alphabrick
We created this gene circuit using AlphaBrick. A software platform created by 2 of our Igem members as                                 part of the winning team in the UK’s first every synthetic biology biohackathon.  The platform makes synbio                                 more accessibly by simplifying the plasmid design process and integrating with transcriptic’s robotic labs                                 to automate the creation of the plasmid. We collaborated with 69 Igem teams, giving them free access to                                 the alpha version for use in their projects.
