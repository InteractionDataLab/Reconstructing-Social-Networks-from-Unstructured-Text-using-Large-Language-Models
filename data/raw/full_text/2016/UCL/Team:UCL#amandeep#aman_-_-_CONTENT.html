                        A solution is urgently needed for the increasing number of infections caused by antibiotic-resistant bacteria. The engineering of bacterial cells to fight human pathogens is a promising alternative to administering traditional antibiotics. Our project involves the use of synthetic biology to engineer living therapeutics that have the potential to treat urinary tract infections (UTIs), which are a major public health concern in developed countries. This is largely due to growing antibiotic resistance.

                        Antibiotic use is associated with numerous negative side effects, allergies and reactions. The most common side effects of antibiotics all impact the digestive system and occur in around one in ten people. <STRONG>Around one person in fifteen has an allergic reaction to antibiotics</STRONG>, especially penicillin and cephalosphorins [<A href="#references">10</A>]. Half of the patients we spoke to during our project wanted us to find an alternative to using antibiotics, owing to the severity of the negative side effects that they experience.
                    </P><P>
                        Despite their negative side effects, antibiotics have been used so widely and for so long that the <STRONG>targeted microbes have adapted to become resistant</STRONG>, reducing the effectiveness of the drugs. A vicious cycle ensues in which ineffective antibiotic treatments leads to overprescription and overexposure, which amplifies the problem of antibiotic resistance. Global antibiotic consumption grew by 30% between 2000 and 2010. [<A href="#references">27</A>] Described by the Chief Medical Officer of England as “a threat equal to that of terrorism”, the growing resistance to antibiotics is hindering the effective prevention and treatment of an ever increasing range of infections.

                            antibiotic resistance poses a catastrophic threat. If we don't act now, any one of us could go into hospital in 20 years for minor surgery and die because of an ordinary infection that can't be treated by antibiotics.

                        The World Health Organisation’s antibiotic resistance Global Report on Surveillance, reports increasing worldwide incidences of antimicrobial resistance, in particular antibiotic resistance. This highlights very high rates of resistance in bacteria that cause common healthcare associated and community-acquired infections, such as UTIs [<A href="#references">1</A>]. UTIs account for over 7 million doctor visits per year. <STRONG>Catheter associated UTIs (CAUTIs) are the most commonly acquired infection in hospitals, and there is a high incidence of antibiotic resistance in the bacteria that cause UTIs globally</STRONG> [<A href="#references">2</A>].

                                Major structural elements of bacterial biofilms.
                            </P></DIV><P>
                        Biofilms are aggregates of surface-associated microorganisms that are encased in a matrix of highly-hydrated extracellular polymeric substances, which include extracellular polysaccharides, extracellular DNA, as well as proteins [<A href="#references">6</A>]. Van Leeuwenhoek, using his simple microscopes in 1684, first observed microorganisms on tooth surfaces and can be credited with the discovery of microbial biofilms. &quot;The number of these animalcules in the scurf of a man's teeth are so many that I believe they exceed the number of men in a kingdom.&quot; - Leeuwenhoek
                    </P><P>
                        We now know a great deal more about biofilms. Environmental changes are responsible for the transition from planktonic growth to biofilm [<A href="#references">13</A>] and cause changes in the expression of surface molecules, virulence factors, and metabolic status. This allows the bacteria to acquire properties that enable their survival in unfavourable conditions [<A href="#references">14,15</A>], such as in the presence of antibiotics.
                    </P><P>
                         The low nutrient and oxygen levels at the bottom of the biofilm give rise to metabolically-inactive bacteria, better known as persister cells. <STRONG>These persister cells are rendered unsusceptible to most traditional antibiotics, which rely on bacterial metabolism to exert cell-killing effect</STRONG> [<A href="#references">7</A>].
                    </P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="section" id="utis"><DIV class="slim"><H2>UTIs</H2><P>
                        Biofilms are currently estimated to be responsible for over 65% of nosocomial infections and 80% of all microbial infections [<A href="#references">16</A>]. Bacterial biofilms play an important role in UTIs. UTIs are caused by the pathogenic invasion of the urinary tract, which causes an inflammatory response of the urothelium.
                    </P><P>
                        It is estimated that approximately 40% of women have had a UTI at some time in their lives [<A href="#references">10</A>]. UTIs may be caused by a variety of different organisms, most commonly bacteria. The most frequent cause of UTI in adult women is <EM>Escherichia coli</EM>, accounting for approximately 85% of community-acquired UTIs and 25-50% of hospital-acquired UTIs. Nosocomial infections may involve more aggressive organisms such as <EM>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</EM> and <EM>Enterobacter</EM> species.

                            Our solution is focused on providing a treatment for UTIs because conventional antibiotics are unable to treat these and other biofilm-associated infections. Given the prevalence of such infections, there is a growing need for alternative therapeutic agents that can specifically degrade biofilms and kill the bacteria encased within. The use of synthetic biology to produce enzymes is the most effective way to achieve this specificity based on current technology. Our solution aims to investigate how bacterial biofilm disrupting proteins and antimicrobial proteins can be exported from <EM>E. coli</EM> and subsequently retain their antibiofilm/antimicrobial function. Using this secretion device we seek to create a system that offers persistent protection against biofilm formation.

                            We have designed a device that can exert antibiofilm and antimicrobial activity against <EM>E. coli</EM> and <EM>P. aeruginosa</EM>, the two leading causes of CAUTIs [<A href="#references">4</A>]. A nonpathogenic laboratory strain of <EM>E. coli</EM> is used as the expression host for the production of these enzymes as a proof-of-concept. The antibiofilm enzymes that we are using are Dispersin B and Micrococcal DNase, and the antimicrobial proteins that we are using are Art-175 and Microcin S.

                            Prof. Malone-Lee stressed to us that sensitivity is a greater problem than complete antibiotic resistance. “Many more strains of bacteria are just insensitive to low doses of antibiotics, many can be overcome by high doses over long periods of time. Resistance is definitely not absolute.” Breaking down the biofilm increases the sensitivity of the bacteria embedded within it. Planktonic bacteria are metabolically active and are thus prone to antibiotics, meaning that lower doses are required.

                            DspB (<A href="http://parts.igem.org/wiki/index.php?title=Part:BBa_K1659200">BBa_K1659200</A>) is an enzyme produced by <EM>Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans</EM>, a species of bacteria found in the human oral cavity that grows almost exclusively in the form of biofilms. Structural analysis of Dispersin B showed that the enzyme only works specifically against the β-1,6-glycosidic linkages found in poly-N-acetylglucosamine, which is a polysaccharide structural element found in the biofilms of <EM>E. coli</EM> but not in <EM>P. aeruginosa</EM>. An additional enzyme would need to be used to target the polysaccharide component of <EM>P. aeruginosa</EM> biofilms.

We are using DNase to break down the extracellular DNA component of biofilms.

                            Although antibiotic resistance is not absolute, it does pose a very big threat to the effective treatment of many infections. The insensitivity of bacteria to antibiotics can also be attributed to increasing antibiotic resistance. As described above, antibiotics also have many side effects that reduce patient quality of life and decrease the likelihood of completing a course of antibiotics. With all of this in mind, our solution does not only break down the biofilm, but also kills the bacteria embedded within so as to provide an alternative to antibiotics.

                                Art-175 (<A href="http://parts.igem.org/wiki/index.php?title=Part:BBa_K1659000">BBa_K1659000</A>) derive their name from “artificial endolysins”. Endolysins are bacteriophage-encoded peptidoglycan hydrolases that pass through the cytoplasmic membrane, degrading the peptidoglycan layer and inducing the lysis of the infected cell.

Microcins are small, enterobacteria-produced bacteriocins that exert antibacterial activity against closely-related species, and MccS is produced by <EM>E. coli</EM> present in the probiotic drug Symbioflor 2 that has been shown to successfully treat gastrointestinal disorders.

                            Current clinically-relevant pathogens have not been seen to exhibit resistance against our antimicrobial proteins of choice. Art-175 has been experimentally shown to be not susceptible to resistance development, likely because it targets the structural element of the bacterial cell wall that is highly conserved across species and difficult to mutate [<A href="#references">8</A>]. The mechanism by which Microcin S exerts antimicrobial activity is still currently unknown, but no bacterial strains except for the original strain of probiotic <EM>E. coli</EM> which produces Microcin S has been shown to be resistant to it thus far [<A href="#references">9</A>].

                            The proven secretion of folded, functional proteins across both bacterial cell membranes is a challenge for present day microbiologists. Our solution requires that we can export DspB, DNase, Art-175 and MccS out of the expression host and into the local biofilm environment. To achieve this, signal sequences are fused to the enzymes to target them for export through natural <EM>E. coli</EM> secretion pathways. Using this mechanism we can direct our anti-biofilm and antimicrobial agents at a biofilm infected surface as they are being produced.

                                DsbA is a oxidoreductase protein found predominantly in Gram-negative bacteria, which functions as a protein-folding factor [<A href="#references">19, 20</A>]. The 2-19 peptide sequence of DsbA is a signal sequence that can direct passenger proteins for co-translational export via the signal recognition particle pathway [<A href="#references">21, 22</A>]. It has recently been shown that the DsbA signal sequence is capable of mediating passenger protein secretion under a selection of different induction temperatures [<A href="#references">23</A>].
