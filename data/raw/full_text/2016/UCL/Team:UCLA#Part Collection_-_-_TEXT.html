Best Parts Collection
Our parts collection features a small library of synthetic protein cages PC Quad 3.0 (obtained from the Yeates Lab) and O3-33 (obtained from the Baker Lab) and their various mutants. These mutants contain insertion mutations that produce a thrombin cleavage site on the exterior of the cage. In the presence of thrombin protease, these mutants are cleaved at the thrombin cleavage site, inducing disassembly of the cage and theoretically releasing an encapsulated molecule.
