THE CONCLUSION TO OUR STORY
Our concluding thoughts
We started Biosynthage unaware of how we live in an age conscious world. How many adverts do you see on television that sell skincare products aimed at making you look youthful? We all started to realise how often people use the words ageing all around us, whether it’s in the media, in a conversation we overhear or in adverts. Often as a young person we ignore this part of our lives, and live the present when we should be thinking of the future. As we have progressed through this journey, the whole team have started so see how important it is to think ahead and start planning what we should do to make later life a better quality of life.
Most of the team members didn’t even realise that ageing was recognised as a world health issue by the World Health Organisation and it’s the large scale of the problem that really opened our eyes and made us realise that we really wanted to do something about this. It’s because of this that we all think ageing is a disease. Realising this has made us all passionate to do something about ageing and we really see that the general public should think the same to do something about this problem.
Not only has the project changed the way we think and understand ageing as a problem, but we also realised how important it is to take care of our bodies. Healthy ageing is only noticed at later years, but we have to do something about it now, as a 20-30-year-old we can live health conscious lives to ensure that later life is easy and of the highest quality as possible. Seeing the elderly at the YMCA centre really allowed us to understand that we all need to be proactive and think about later life, earlier on in our lives.
We felt that by talking to more and more people, it widened our perspectives and mad us think of factors of our project that we never thought of to begin with. Talking to people who have a real responsibility and importance in society allowed us to really visualise the problems associated with our project and actions we can do to solve them. We have come to see that the government has a crucial role in the implementation of these therapies and they do change the way we think about our issues.
Below is a video of the final thoughts of the team members
Sequel to our story? What’s in the future?
Whilst ageing is still a sensitive subject, we hope that through our project we can help reduce the stigma that continues to surround this issue and change the way people think about healthy ageing.
The team really believes that we should continue to make this issue more well known whether that’s through developing apps or convincing people with different powers in society that our therapies should be implemented.
Ageing is a disease. We believe that by making people change the way they think about ageing, we can do something quickly to implement these products into society and build a better society.
