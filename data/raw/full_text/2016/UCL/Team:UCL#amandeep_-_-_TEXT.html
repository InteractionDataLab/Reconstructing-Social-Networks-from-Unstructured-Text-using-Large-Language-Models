Short abstract
BioSynthAge: Do not go gentle into that good night
We envision a time in which the human population lives a healthier life, for longer. We will use synthetic biology to ensure the ageing world population can both maintain their quality of life and extend their lifespan - increasing their ‘healthspan’. The health challenges currently posed by ageing are many and complex so we propose a suite of synthetic biology solutions to tackle these challenges. Our synthetic biology solutions will include, but not be limited to, the following:
Oxidative stress – the root of the problem
Oxidative stress underlies many of the health problems of ageing so we will develop a number of free radical mopping devices. These devices will include therapeutic bacterial chassis triggered by oxidative-stress to deliver free-radical mopping compounds. To lay a conceptual foundation for genetic tools that address ageing within human cells, we will also use gene-editing tools to map the relationship between telomerase expression and cellular robustness to oxidative stress.
False teeth – a thing of the past
Increasing tooth loss remains a feature of old age in humans throughout the world. We will harness synthetic biology to improve the dental health of the ageing population by designing bacteria that do not cause decay but actually prevent it. These biofilm-fillings will provide a regenerative internal environment for the tooth whilst fighting off the surface bacteria that cause dental plaques.
Grey love – it does not have to be dangerous
You may be surprised to know that sexually transmitted diseases are particularly prevalent in elderly populations. By embedding living biosensors into lubricant gels we will simplify the process of screening potential partners for sexually transmitted infections – as the gel will glow in the night on contact with organisms such as Neisseria gonorrhoeae.
We believe that our ageing project was a great topic to explore and has a huge potential to make both social, cultural and economic impact.

Wiki Requirements page
Template Documentation
Styling your wiki
You may style this page as you like or you can simply leave the style as it is. You can easily keep the styling and edit the content of these default wiki pages with your project information and completely fulfill the requirement to document your project.
While you may not win Best Wiki with this styling, your team is still eligible for all other awards. This default wiki meets the requirements, it improves navigability and ease of use for visitors, and you should not feel it is necessary to style beyond what has been provided.
Wiki template information
We have created these wiki template pages to help you get started and to help you think about how your team will be evaluated. You can find a list of all the pages tied to awards here at the Pages for awards link. You must edit these pages to be evaluated for medals and awards, but ultimately the design, layout, style and all other elements of your team wiki is up to you!
Editing your wiki
On this page you can document your project, introduce your team members, document your progress and share your iGEM experience with the rest of the world!
Use WikiTools - Edit in the black menu bar to edit this page
Tips
This wiki will be your team’s first interaction with the rest of the world, so here are a few tips to help you get started:
State your accomplishments! Tell people what you have achieved from the start.
Be clear about what you are doing and how you plan to do this.
You have a global audience! Consider the different backgrounds that your users come from.
Make sure information is easy to find; nothing should be more than 3 clicks away.
Avoid using very small fonts and low contrast colors; information should be easy to read.
Start documenting your project as early as possible; don’t leave anything to the last minute before the Wiki Freeze. For a complete list of deadlines visit the iGEM 2016 calendar
Have lots of fun!
Inspiration
You can also view other team wikis for inspiration! Here are some examples:

2014 Michigan
2014 ITESM-Guadalajara
2014 SCU-China
Uploading pictures and files
You can upload your pictures and files to the iGEM 2016 server. Remember to keep all your pictures and files within your team's namespace or at least include your team's name in the file name.
When you upload, set the "Destination Filename" to
T--YourOfficialTeamName--NameOfFile.jpg. (If you don't do this, someone else might upload a different file with the same "Destination Filename", and your file would be erased!)
