Survey
How did the input we received from that stakeholder interaction influence the direction of our project?
As a result of that stakeholder interaction we realised that some of our preconceptions of the issue were wrong. We modified the language we used. When we fed this back to the general public by reaching out the them on the streets of London.
As a result we:
Blog + Vlog
Designed an app
Ran some workshops
Outreach activities
How did the input we received from that stakeholder interaction influence the direction of our project?
As a result of this interaction we realised through the debates, that ageing research is not just a great thing for society but also raises a large about of issues that are long term. Some of the students raised issues that the UCL igem team didn't even think about. For example, the year 12 students mentioned that overcrowding and a change in the pension scheme will result from people living healthier lives for longer, which may be a negative implication of ageing research. We then wanted to talk to politicians about these long term issues and to find out what they think. As a result we then mt with David Kurten at City Hall.

How did the input we received from that stakeholder interaction influence the direction of our project?
As a result of that stakeholder interaction we modified the language we used, and changed the way we presented our project. When we fed this back to the stakeholder (experts within synthetic biology Skype calls) they approved.
Talked to researchers currently in the field of ageing

As a result of that stakeholder interaction we realised that some of our preconceptions of the issue were wrong. We modified the language we used, we introduced BioBrick XXXX to our experimental plan and we updated out model to encompass YYY. When we fed this back to the stakeholder they approved.Something like that. Basically the human practices needs to be bi-directional in nature.

Delete this box in order to be evaluated for this medal. See more information at Instructions for Pages for awards .
Expand on your silver medal activity by demonstrating how you have integrated the investigated issues into the design and/or execution of your project.
iGEM teams are unique and leading the field because they "go beyond the lab" to imagine their projects in a social/environmental context, to better understand issues that might influence the design and use of their technologies.
Teams work with students and advisors from the humanities and social sciences to explore topics concerning ethical, legal, social, economic, safety or security issues related to their work. Consideration of these Human Practices is crucial for building safe and sustainable projects that serve the public interest.
For more information, please see the Human Practices Hub .
