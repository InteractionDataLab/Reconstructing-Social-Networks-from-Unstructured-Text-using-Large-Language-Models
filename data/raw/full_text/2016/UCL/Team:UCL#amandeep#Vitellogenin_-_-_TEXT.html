Vitelogenin
Whitefly (B.tabaci) are small insects common in house plants that have developed resistance to many synthetic pesticides making chemical control difficult.
We are going to conduct bio-control of whitefly by attacking the Vitellogenin receptor protein using RNAi. Vitellogenin improces cell oxidative stress tolerance. Removing the Vitellogenin receptor would cause whitefly to die as a result of accumulated oxidative stress.
