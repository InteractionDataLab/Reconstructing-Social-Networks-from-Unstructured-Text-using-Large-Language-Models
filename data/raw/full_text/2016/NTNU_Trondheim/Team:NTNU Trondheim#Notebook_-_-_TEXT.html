Throughout the course of our lab work, we have documented our day-to-day activities in order to achieve two goals. The first is to ensure that we, as a team, are updated on the progress of experiments in the lab so that we reduce guesswork and increase the logistical capacity of our team. The second goal is to ensure that our project is reproducible. In other words, it just makes for good science! You may view the journal below or download the pdf directly here .
