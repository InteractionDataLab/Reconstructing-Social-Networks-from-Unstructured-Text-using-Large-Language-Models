Logic Gates.
DNA.
Innovation.
Computers work by moving information between computational units, called gates. Each of these gates exhibits a simple logical statement (AND, OR, NOT...). The implementation of these logic gates is the foundation for all of the life-changing applications computer technology has provided. Our goal is to bring the great potential of computer technology, such as developing a new generation of biosensors, improving the process of industrial fermentations, or advancing cancer research to the field of biological engineering
