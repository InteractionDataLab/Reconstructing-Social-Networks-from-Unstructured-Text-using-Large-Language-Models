Marketing
The marketing department was responsible for creating our commercial offer, communicating with potential sponsors and handling our finances.
Laboratory team
The people who did the most of the labwork by testing our phenylalanine ammonia-lyase and Polyphe protein approaches.
Modelling
In order to find the most stable mutants having multiple phenylalanine residues, we have developed a script based on R programming language. This script uses FoldX protein modeling program as a tool for protein mutagenesis and stability calculation. The script and its manual can be accessed at GitHub.
Interlab Group
Our team participated in one of the largest interlaboratory studies in synthetic biology. We contributed by helping establishing a baseline for replicability of fluorescence measurements and identified likely key sources of error.
Human Practices
Our human practices team organized a number of public discussions on current issues in life sciences such as GMOs, CRISPR/Cas9 system or ethical issues concerning the treatment of genetic diseases. We also met with specialists working with the treatment of phenylketonuria (PKU) in Lithuania to discussed the need for additional treatment options. Finally, we presented our project to the Lithuanian PKU patients’ association.
Public Relations
Our public relations department took care of our social media accounts such as Facebook and Twitter. We wrote a number of articles to most of Lithuanian news websites and an article to Bored Panda.
