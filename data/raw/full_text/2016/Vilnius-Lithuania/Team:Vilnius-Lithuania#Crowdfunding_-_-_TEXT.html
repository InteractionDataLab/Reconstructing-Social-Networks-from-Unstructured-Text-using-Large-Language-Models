Phenylketonuria is a disorder resulting in devastating consequences for people who genetically inherited it. In order to spread awareness about it while also trying to raise money for the PheLoss probiotics development, the team started a crowdfunding campaign in mid-summer.
The main objective in preparation for crowdfunding was filming a short introductory movie presenting the issue. The production of the intro was a new experience for every team member. The whole process of filmmaking required the knowledge of specific techniques to create compelling introduction and easy-to-understand storyboards. After encountering complications due to insufficient knowledge concerning filmmaking, the team received invaluable help from a film production student studying at Vilnius Gediminas Technical University. With new ideas and clear direction of the introductory movie, our team achieved impressive project presentation and delivered strong message about phenylketonuria. Here are some photos from the backstage:
