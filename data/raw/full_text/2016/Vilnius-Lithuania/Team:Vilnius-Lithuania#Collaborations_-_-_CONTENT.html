in mathematical modeling of our experiments. We
appreciated their operative and precise work a lot.
We have agreed on the collaboration over a couple of
Skype calls and continued to manage the deal by the
emails over a period of two months. The description of
the modeling Oxford team performed can be
found here.</P><P class="Raleway">What is more, we did not only collaborate on the dry
lab, but also on the Human Practices side. Since we
found out that our projects looked quite similar and
were based on the creation of probiotics, we have
launched a survey on probiotics delivery method and
compared the results between two countries. The
results of the survey are described here.</P></DIV><DIV id="WAS"><H2 class="Raleway">WashU iGEM</H2><P class="Raleway">We are very grateful to <A href="https://2016.igem.org/Team:WashU_StLouis" alt="link to team page"> WashU StLouis iGEM </A> team from Washington, USA, who agreed to collaborate and asked to confirm their results of a biobrick characterization. They have chosen to characterize a part from this year’s distribution kit – a <A href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K873002"> HSP promoter.</A> We have organized the collaboration over a friendly online conversation. The details of a biobrick characterization can be found here.</P></DIV><DIV id="AAH"><H2 class="Raleway">Aachen iGEM</H2><P class="Raleway">We have organised collaboration with <A href="x">Aachen iGEM team</A>. We tried to find out the opinion and to define the current knowledge of the common public about genetic engineering in Lithuania. Our team managed to question 57 people of different educational background. Results revealed that the majority of people in Vilnius were poorly informed about genetic manipulations.</P></DIV><DIV id="VIR"><H2 class="Raleway">Virginia iGEM</H2><P class="Raleway">We were happy to help <A href="https://2016.igem.org/Team:Virginia" alt="link to team page"> Virginia iGEM </A> team by responding to their survey about the awareness and use of biocontainment in iGEM projects. We hope that our answers were helpful for creating a pamphlet for future iGEM teams to disseminate information about biocontainment and provide tools for teams to select and implement methods more easily.</P></DIV><DIV id="BUL"><H2 class="Raleway">Bulgaria iGEM</H2><P class="Raleway">We were very happy that a new team <A href="https://2016.igem.org/Team:Bulgaria" alt="link to team page"> Bulgaria iGEM </A> provided our team member Sofija with a warm welcome. We have exchanged our project ideas, shared experience, and gave some insights on how to manage the project. Bulgaria iGEM team members kindly showed Sofija the laboratory they are working in and also showed her around the city. We are very happy that iGEM competition creates possibilities of international communication.</P></DIV><DIV id="PES"><H2 class="Raleway">Peshawar iGEM</H2><P class="Raleway"> We had pleasure to talk with iGEM Peshawar. We mostly talked about our projects, but still had time to chat informally. Our team got some advice and reactions on our proof of concept and development of the final product.</P></DIV><DIV id="LTX"><H2 class="Raleway">Lasa-TX iGEM</H2><P class="Raleway">We were interested how other teams were performing. The main reason was to find how we could improve our own performance. We talked on skype with  iGEM 2016 team Austin_UTexas_LASA. We discussed our projects, shared experience and even told funny iGEM stories. We found how both teams could collaborate. We asked if Austin_UTexas_LASA could complete our “Successful iGEM team survey“ and our team agreed to cooperate with them in the future in a similar way.  </P></DIV><DIV id="TLH"><H2 class="Raleway">Tel-Hai iGEM</H2><P class="Raleway">We also organised a skype call with a team from Israel –<A href="https://2016.igem.org/Team:Tel-Hai" alt="link to team page"> iGEM Tel Hai 2016 </A>. Our colleagues are also working with a genetic disease. Our team thought we could share our experience on relevant topics, for instance, probiotics. Unfortunately, we did not establish any ground for the collaboration, because both teams were using completely different strategies. However, we still had a pleasant talk.  </P></DIV><DIV id="XMU"><H2 class="Raleway">XMU_China iGEM</H2><P class="Raleway">A team from Xiamen University,<A href="https://2016.igem.org/Team:XMU-China" alt="link to team page"> XMU-China </A>, launched an annual information exchange platform named Newsletter – an electronic journal containing information about the majority of iGEM teams. We were very glad that we were invited to be a part of it. We provided XMU with the thorough information about our team and our project and we hope to continue making this contribution in the future.
