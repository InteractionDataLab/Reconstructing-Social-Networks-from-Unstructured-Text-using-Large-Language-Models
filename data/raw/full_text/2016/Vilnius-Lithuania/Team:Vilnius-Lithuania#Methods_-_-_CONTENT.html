Supernatant is discarded, leaving about 100 µL of solution, in which cells are re-suspended. These cells are mixed with 10-20 ng of ligate or plasmid DNA. The mixture is incubated on ice for half an hour, then placed in a thermostat at 42ºC for 1 minute. 1 mL of LB liquid medium is added to the mixture and cells are incubated in a shaking thermostat for 1 hour at 37ºC. The tubes are pelleted by centrifuging; supernatant is discarded, leaving about 50 µL, in which cells are re-suspended.

Next day, the overnight culture is transferred to the tubes with 20 mL LB medium at a dilution 1:20 and grown for 3 hours at 37ºC. 0.2% arabinose is added to each tube. Bacteria are then grown at 37ºC for 4-5 hours. Cells are pelleted and stored in -20ºC or re-suspended in 1 mL Tris-NaCl buffer. 10 µL of PSMF is added to each tube.

Each gel consists of separating (lower) and stacking (upper) gels. For the separating gel acrylamide solution, Tris-HCl (pH 8,8) buffer and milli-Q H2O is mixed with 17 µL APS and 10 µL TEMED solutions and poured into the gel preparation frame with the water on top of it. After that the stacking gel is made from acrylamide solution, Tris-HCl (pH 6,8) buffer, milli-Q H2O, 10 µL of APS and 10 µL of TEMED. Whole mixture is poured into the gel preparation frame (on top of the separating gel), comb inserted into the stacking gel and everything is left to gelate. Protein sample preparation: 45 µL of soluble and insoluble fraction samples after lysation are mixed together with 15 µL loading protein dye and denaturated for 10 minutes at 100ºC. Prepared gel is put into gel loading machine, samples are loaded into the wells, as well as protein ladder. After electrophoresis, one gel is placed in the transfer buffer, while the other is dyed with Page Blue dye. </P><H2 class="Raleway">Western bloting</H2><P class="Raleway"> Load SDS-PAGE and keep the gel in the transfer buffer after. The membrane and six pieces of Whatman paper are prepared: membrane is placed into methanol for a few seconds, then placed into transfer buffer; Whatman papers are also placed in transfer buffer for 10 minutes. Transfer from gel onto the membrane is performed in a western blot system for an hour, 10 mA. After transfer, membrane is blocked for half an hour in the blocking buffer. After blocking primary antibodies are placed in the buffer with the membrane and incubated for half an hour. After incubation, membrane is washed at least three times with wash buffer for 10 minutes. After washing, secondary antibodies are added to the buffer and membrane is incubated again for half an hour. After incubation, membrane wash is repeated as before. After washing membrane is visualized by adding it to substrate buffer together with 66 µL NBT and 33 µL BCIP and incubating for a few minutes. </P><H2 class="Raleway">Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)</H2><P class="Raleway">All the reaction components are mixed on ice in specific proportions (adding polymerase last) and quickly transfered into preheated thermocycler. </P><H2 class="Raleway">Colony PCR</H2><P class="Raleway">All the reaction components, except the bacteria, are mixed on ice in specific proportions (adding polymerase last).
