SDS-PAGE+NB of gp45 modified genes. Colony PCR. Run gel with restricted biobricks + colony PCR (psB1C3-T-PheP) from other not checked colonies. Also, specify PheP PCR after cleaning. Restrict csm+pETDuet, check if fragment lengths are right. If so, inoculate more cells for sequencing.  Transform to strains BL21, C41, ER2566, inoculate overnight culture. Reclone pSB1C3-T-PheP if, after colony PCR, colonies will be found bad. (best to reclone right away, in case of bad results after colony PCR). (With the condition that yesterday’s cloning went wrong. There are few colonies that need to be checked by colony PCR. We have to perform colony PCR for constructs: pSB1C3-T-PheP-tRNA. There are few colonies from cloning. We have to check if constructs: Csm4 in pSB1C3 (sequencing) and gp45 in pSB1C3 (colony PCR picture) are good. Maybe we remake them. If everything is ok, check if we have enough for sequencing. If not, inoculate more for minipreping.
