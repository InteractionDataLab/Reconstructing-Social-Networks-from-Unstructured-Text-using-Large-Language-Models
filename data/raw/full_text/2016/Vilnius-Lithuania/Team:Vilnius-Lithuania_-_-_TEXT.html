Project description
Rare genetic diseases are often neglected by both society and pharmaceutical industry due to low numbers of those affected, which makes the development of the treatment highly unprofitable. One of such diseases is phenylketonuria (PKU), a rare genetically inherited condition, which is defined by the inability of an organism to break down amino acid phenylalanine. As a result, excess phenylalanine accumulates in the brain of the patient, affecting its function and causing severe mental retardation. The only available treatment nowadays is a strict low-protein diet and powdered phenylalanine-free meal which is very limited in taste and form.
This year, an iGEM team from Vilnius, Lithuania, is determined to help the ones suffering from this rare genetic condition.  The treatment we propose is a probiotic, which would either take in excess phenylalanine or break it down in the gut of the patient, preventing the symptoms of the disease. The final product will be presented in the form of a gastro-resistant pill, which would be accessible and easy to use.

Welcome to iGEM 2016!
Your team has been approved and you are ready to start the iGEM season!
Before you start:
Please read the following pages:

Wiki Requirements page
Template Documentation
Styling your wiki
You may style this page as you like or you can simply leave the style as it is. You can easily keep the styling and edit the content of these default wiki pages with your project information and completely fulfill the requirement to document your project.
While you may not win Best Wiki with this styling, your team is still eligible for all other awards. This default wiki meets the requirements, it improves navigability and ease of use for visitors, and you should not feel it is necessary to style beyond what has been provided.
Wiki template information
We have created these wiki template pages to help you get started and to help you think about how your team will be evaluated. You can find a list of all the pages tied to awards here at the Pages for awards link. You must edit these pages to be evaluated for medals and awards, but ultimately the design, layout, style and all other elements of your team wiki is up to you!
Editing your wiki
On this page you can document your project, introduce your team members, document your progress and share your iGEM experience with the rest of the world!
Use WikiTools - Edit in the black menu bar to edit this page
Tips
This wiki will be your team’s first interaction with the rest of the world, so here are a few tips to help you get started:
State your accomplishments! Tell people what you have achieved from the start.
Be clear about what you are doing and how you plan to do this.
You have a global audience! Consider the different backgrounds that your users come from.
Make sure information is easy to find; nothing should be more than 3 clicks away.
Avoid using very small fonts and low contrast colors; information should be easy to read.
Start documenting your project as early as possible; don’t leave anything to the last minute before the Wiki Freeze. For a complete list of deadlines visit the iGEM 2016 calendar
Have lots of fun!
Inspiration
You can also view other team wikis for inspiration! Here are some examples:

2014 Michigan
2014 ITESM-Guadalajara
2014 SCU-China
Uploading pictures and files
You can upload your pictures and files to the iGEM 2016 server. Remember to keep all your pictures and files within your team's namespace or at least include your team's name in the file name.
When you upload, set the "Destination Filename" to
T--YourOfficialTeamName--NameOfFile.jpg. (If you don't do this, someone else might upload a different file with the same "Destination Filename", and your file would be erased!)
