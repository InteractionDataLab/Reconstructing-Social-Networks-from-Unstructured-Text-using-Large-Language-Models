BBa_K1962010 (Bile Salts Sensing Device)
This is a composite part which consists of the bile salt responsive promoter ( BBa_K318514 ) and a combined ribosome binding site / GFP / terminators biobrick ( BBa_E0840 ). The acrRA operon is found in Salmonella enterica strain LT2 and the promoter sequence contains a RamA ( BBa_K1962009 ) binding sequence.
BBa_K1962011 (A device for expression of Im-Ia in response to bile salts)
This is a composite part which consists of a bile salt responsive promoter ( BBa_K318514 ), a RBS ( BBa_B0030 ) and the biobrick encoding the Immunity Protein to Colicin Ia ( BBa_K1962001 ). For best results use in conjunction with the RamA transcriptional activator ( BBa_K1962009 ). The promoter activity has been chracterised using a GFP reporter ( BBa_K1962010 ).
BBa_K1962012 (A device for expression of Im-E3 in response to bile salts)
This is a composite part that is designed to induce production of the Immunity Protein to Colicin E3 in the presence of bile. The composite part consists of the bile salt responsive promoter ( BBa_K318514 ), RBS ( BBa_B0030 ) and the Colicin E3 Immunity protein ( BBa_K1962004 ). For best results, use in conjunction with the transcriptional activator RamA ( BBa_K1962009 ).
BBa_K1962013 (A pH Sensing Device Based on The gadA Promoter)
This is a composite part that allows further characterisation of the pH sensitive gadA promoter from E. coli. The composite part comprises the gadA promoter( BBa_K1231001 ) and a combined RBS / GFP/ terminators biobrick ( BBa_E0840 ).
BBa_K1962014 (A pH Sensing Device Based on The asr Promoter)
The "acid shock RNA" asr promoter is a pH sensitive promoter native to E. coli that has been documented by other iGEM teams. Here, we present a composite part to allow further characterisation of promoter activity. The composite part consists of the asr promoter( BBa_K1231000 ) and a combined biobrick containing RBS / GFP / terminators ( BBa_E0840 ).
BBa_K1962015 (A device for expression of Im-Ia in response to pH)
This is a composite part for the production of the Immunity Protein to Colicin Ia in response to environmental pH changes. The composite part consists of a pH sensitive promoter (asr from biobrick BBa_K1231000 , an RBS ( BBa_B0030 ) and the Immunity Protein required to neutralise the bacteriocin activity of Colicin Ia ( BBa_K1962001 ).
BBa_K1962016 (A device for expression of Im-E3 in response to pH)
This is a composite part for the regulated expression of the Immunity Protein for netralization of the Colicin E3, which is a specific RNase. The composite part was assembled from a pH responsive promoter ( BBa_K1231000 ), an RBS ( BBa_B0030 ) and the biobrick encoding the Immunity Protein against E3 (Im-E3) ( BBa_K1962004 ).
