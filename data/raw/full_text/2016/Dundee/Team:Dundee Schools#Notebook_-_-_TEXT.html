Week 1 - Familiarising ourselves with the labs
Transformation + Overnight of pSBIC3
Mini Prep of pSBIC3
Restriction Digest of pSB1C3
PCR’s:
Hfq E. coli- Unsuccessful
Hfq Serratia- Unsuccessful
OsmY- Unsuccessful
Mini Prep of pSBIC3
Restriction Digest of pSB1C3
Week 2 - Carrying on with cloning
PCR’s:
Hfq E. coli- Unsuccessful
Hfq Serratia – Unsuccessful
osmY- Unsuccessful
3rd PCR set up:
Hfq E. coli – Successful
Hfq Serratia – Unsuccessful
OsmY - Successful
PCR’s:
Hfq Serratia 2 at 49°C - Successful
Hfq Serratia 1 at 65°C - Successful
Ligation into PSBIC3 and transformed
The 3 successful PCR’s were plated at concentrations of 2:1 and 3:1 with vector; no plates grew colonies
Week 3 - Made our first BioBrick
Redid all 3 PCR’S – Hfq E. coli and osmY both worked. Hfq Serratia did not.
Colony PCR of the successful PCR’s, overnight, mini prep, sent away for sequencing and then stocked.
First 2 BioBricks made: OsmY + Hfq E. coli
PCR of osmY-hfq E. coli fusion and PCR of osmY-hfq Serratia Fusion - successful
Digested and Ligated etc.… sequenced then stocked.
2 BioBricks made: osmY Hfq E. coli Fusion + osmY Hfq Serratia Fusion
Week 4 - Started to make gene fragments
PCR of Hfq Serratia - successful
Sequenced and Stocked.
1 Bio brick made: Hfq Serratia
Gene fragments – EC-SRNA and sma-SRNA digested and ligated into pSBIC3
Digestion of Rhamnose promoter plasmid
Week 5 – Started to add Ha tags
Ligations:
rbs-osmY-Hfq-E. coli
rbs-osmY-Hfq-Serratia
rbs-osmY-Hfq-E. coli- Ha Tag
rbs-osmY-Hfq-Serratia- Ha Tag
PCR’s:
rbs-osmY- Ha Tag - Successful
rbs-osmY-Hfq E. coli- Ha Tag- Successful
rbs-osmY-Hfq Serratia-Ha Tag – Successful
All PCR’s transformed and overnighted.
Week 6 - Phage outbreak
Overnights of:
rbs-osmY-Hfq- Ha tag
rbs-osmY-Hfq E. coli- Ha tag
rbs-osmY-Hfq Serratia- Ha tag
Mini preps, sequencing and transformations of the above
Phage outbreak on Thursday; due to this all transformations were lost, but re-done the next day
All sent away for sequencing
Ec – SRNA and sma SRNA – both stocked.
Week 7 - Western blots
We did our first western blot test with no timed samples.
We also completed a timed western blot by adding different concentrations of Rhamnose and taking samples every hour
Primers:
fliC for Ec-sRNA
virF for Ec-sRNA
Week 8 - Final week
Performed another Western Blot to get a much cleaner image for the whole cell
Overnights with Ec-SRNA fliC in MG1655 and Ec-SRNA virF
Plates grew colonies – colony PCR with colonies.
Sent away for sequencing
Dry Team
Week 1 -
Started off discussing our topic of bacterial infections and brainstorming how we could target them; settled on RNA interference.
Split the team into 2 groups, wet team (Matthew, Bartosz, Albert) and dry team (Mia, Beth, Darryl).
Decided what each team had to do for that week
Started with general research on our chosen infections (Cholera and Shigellosis)
Darryl started and completed learning basic HTML and CSS via tutorials on the site Codecadamy, then began the initial stages of the wiki so as to get to grips with it.
Week 2 -
Began to contact various people/organisations:
Colalife
Mercy Ships
Water Aid
Lifeline Express
Had our first meeting about maths modelling and discussed how we could incorporate it into our project.
Further developed wiki.
Week 3 -
Had a phone call with Brian Walshe of Mercy Ships
Started organisation for Northern meet up:
Began developing presentation content and layout
Work began on poster
Week 4 -
Spoke to Rob Porter (Prof. of clinical microbiology) via email.
Planned a skype call with Simon Berry of Colalife.
Contacted British Red Cross.
Week 5 -
Attended the Edinburgh Northern meet up & presented our project there, to which we were met with excellent feedback.
Carried on working in the lab and progressing with our presentation.
Further development of poster.
Week 6 -
Contacted British Pharmaceutical Society
Contacted Mark McCulloch (Army Doctor)
Carried on with making our poster for the UK meet up.
Week 7 -
Set up meeting with Mark
Finished poster
Carried on with our wiki content
Received our FBI sunglasses and pens for the Jamboree.
Week 8 -
Attended the UK meet up in London – presented our talk and our poster to multiple UK iGEM teams.
Got our hoodies and t-shirts for Boston.
Had our agent photoshoot.
