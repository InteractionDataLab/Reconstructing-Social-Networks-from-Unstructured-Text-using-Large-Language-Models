"BactiFeed is All You Need"
Abstract
Antimicrobial resistance will kill between 14 million and 444 million people by 2050, according to the       World Health Organisation. Antibiotics are used extensively in livestock to combat infection; this is a       massive contributor to the growing problem of antibacterial resistance.
An alternative treatment for livestock is needed if we are to preserve antibiotics for medicinal use.      To combat this, we are Fighting Bacterial Infections by modifying bacteriocins through introducing novel toxic domains. We       are engineering non-pathogenic E. coli to produce bacteriocins in response to conditions in the GI       tract that will kill pathogenic strains of E. coli and similar bacteria such as Salmonella. We believe our       GM bacteria can be used in an animal feed, a ‘BactiFeed’, to tackle common bacterial infections in       livestock, decrease unnecessary antibiotic usage and reduce the development of antibacterial resistance.
