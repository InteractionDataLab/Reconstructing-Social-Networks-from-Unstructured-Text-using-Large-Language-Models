The final design of our product looks like this:
This basic design is the first step to tackling the concerns we came across when talking to professionals about our project.
It is a filter designed to target the desired bacteria (for our project we chose Vibrio cholerae and Shigella) and prevent it from causing infection. The small filter with the bacteria inside means the bacteria won’t be ingested, and therefore prevents any problems of the E. coli and RNA not surviving in the body. Also, having the filter come in a bottle would increase the chance of our filter being used in developing countries as well asproviding a container for storing water.
