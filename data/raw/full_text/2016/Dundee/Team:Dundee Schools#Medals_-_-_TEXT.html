Medals
We had a great time at the Giant Jamboree, and are hugely appreciative of the opportunity! We came away with several awards/nominations, which made the experience even better.
Overall project medal
We are very proud to say that our project fulfilled all the criteria for a Gold medal.
Nominations
We were nominated for 4 awards: best poster, best presentation, best composite part and best part collection. We are extremely happy with this!
Thanks again to all of our advisors and supervisors - and the iGEM foundation - without whom, this amazing experience would not have been possible.
