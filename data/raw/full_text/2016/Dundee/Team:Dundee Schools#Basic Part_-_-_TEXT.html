BBa_K1963000 (Hfq from E. coli K-12)
Hfq is an RNA binding protein. It can bind to a range of RNA sequences but is often used in conjunction with an RNA hairpin formed by the E. coli micC sequence.
BBa_K1963001 (Hfq from Serratia marcescens DB10/DB11)
An RNA binding protein from the Hfq family.
BBa_K1963002 (A template for expression of sRNA fusions to the E. coli micC hairpin)
This is a multi-sequence system for small RNA (sRNA) production in an E. coli host or with co-expression of E. coli Hfq in an alternative host. The system has the proD strong promoter, followed by the micC hairpin, followed by the strong terminator sequence T1/TE. Phosphorylated primers should be used to insert the reverse/complement target sequence of your choice between the promoter and the hairpin sequence. The sRNA should be placed between C-193 and T-194.
BBa_K1963003 (A template for expression of sRNA fusions to the Serratia chiA hairpin)
This is a multi-sequence system for small RNA (sRNA) production with co-expression of S. marcescens Hfq BBa_K1963001 . The system has the proD strong promoter, followed by a chiA hairpin sequence from the 3'-end of the S. marcescens chiA gene encoding a chitinase, followed by the strong terminator sequence T1/TE. The use of an S. marcescens chiA hairpin/Hfq pairing should provide very high specificity in chosen chassis organisms. Phosphorylated primers should be used to insert the reverse/complement target sequence of your choice between the promoter and the hairpin sequence. The sRNA should be placed betweeen C-193 and G-194.
BBa_K1963004 (An sRNA system for down-regulation of E. coli fliC encoding flagellin.)
This is a multi-sequence system for small RNA (sRNA) production in an E. coli host - or especially with co-expression of E. coli Hfq BBa_K1963000 . The system is based on the BBa_K1963002 template and has the proD strong promoter, followed by a short antisense sequence targeting the 5' end of the fliC transcript, followed by the E. coli micC hairpin, followed by the strong terminator sequence T1/TE. The anti fliC sRNA is placed betweeen C-193 and T-194. The system should impair motility of E. coli.
BBa_K1963005 (A translational fusion between E. coli OsmY and E. coli Hfq)
OsmY is a secreted protein and Hfq is an RNA binding protein. This fusion system could be used to export RNA from the cell.
BBa_K1963006 (A translational fusion between E. coli OsmY and Serratia Hfq)
The E. coli OsmY protein is secreted from the cell. Serratia Hfq is an RNA binding protein. This translational fusion between the two may allow Hfq to be secreted from an E. coli chassis organism, together with any specific sRNA that may be attached. Pairing Serratia Hfq and Serratia sRNA sequences may afford some specificity to the system.
