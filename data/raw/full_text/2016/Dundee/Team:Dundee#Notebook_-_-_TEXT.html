Thaw 100 µl of competent cells on ice for 20 min and mix with either 1 µl of plasmid DNA or 10 µl ligation reaction.
Chill cells on ice for 20 min.
Heat shock cells at 42°C for 90 seconds, before chilling cells on ice for 2 min.
Add 1 ml of LB to cells and recover at 37°C with shaking for 1 hour.
Pellet cells by centrifugation at 13 000 rpm for 3 min.
Remove supernatant resuspend in 200 µl of LB and plate onto LB medium containing appropriate antibiotics.
Incubate plates overnight at 37oC.
Polymerase Chain Reaction
1. PCR reaction mix set up as follows (final volume = 50 µl)
2. Thermocycler protocol (Elongation time was altered according to desired length of PCR product).
3. Run products on a 1% agarose gel for analysis.
Agarose Gel Electrophoresis
DNA products are run on a 1% (w/v) agarose gel to separate charged nucleic acids by size for analysis or purification. GelRed used to stain nucleic acids and gels visualised on a BioRad GelDoc.
For 1% (w/v) agarose gel
Weigh out 1g of agarose and pour into 100 ml of 1 x tris-acetate-EDTA (TAE) buffer.
Heat agarose solution in the microwave until the agarose had dissolved (1-3minutes) and there is a rolling boil.
All the solution to cool before Gel Red (6µl per 100ml of 1% (w/v) agarose solution) is added.
Pour agarose solution into a gel tray with the required combs in place.
Allow the agarose solution to cool in the gel tray before loading the DNA into the gel.
Mix the DNA samples with 10 x DNA loading dye and load on the gel with the DNA marker (Roche).
Run the gels in 1 x TAE buffer for 30 min at 100 V. After sufficient separation the gel is visualised under UV light on the BioRad GelDoc.
TAE buffer recipe (pH 7.6): 40mM Tris, 20mM acetic acid, 1mM EDTA
QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit protocol (Qiagen)
QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit Protocol from Qiagen was used. This was designed to extract and purify DNA from agarose gels in TAE buffer.
Excise DNA from agarose gel with a clean sharp scalpel and add into a tube.
Add 800 µl of buffer QG of gel slice.
Incubate at 50°C for 10 min or until gel slice has completely dissolved. To help dissolve gel, mix by vortexing the tube every 2-3 minutes.
After gel slice has dissolved completely the colour of the mixture should be yellow.
Add 200 µl of isopropanol to sample and mix.
Add 500µl of buffer QG to the QIAquick column and centrifuge for 1 minute. Discard flow-through and place the QIAquick column back into the same tube.
To wash, add 750 µl buffer PE to QIAquick column and centrifuge for 1 minute. Discard flow-through and place the QIAquick column back into the same tube. Centrifuge the QIAquick column in the 2ml collection tube provided for 1 minute to remove residual wash buffer.
Place the QIAquick into a clean 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube
To elute DNA, add 50 µl of water to the centre of the QIAquick membrane and centrifuge for 1 minute.
To analyse purified DNA of a gel, add 1 volume of loading dye to 5 volumes of purified DNA.
Restriction digest
Restriction digests are performed to prepare DNA for ligation. Enzymes used were supplied by Roche and New England Biolabs. 60 µl reactions following clean up after PCR were set up.
60 µl reactions following clean up after PCR were set up as follows:
DNA = 50 µl
Buffer = 6 µl cognate digestion buffer, for enzyme (s)
Restriction enzyme 1 = 1.5 µl
Restriction enzyme 2 = 1.5 µl
H20 = 1 µl
Incubate at 37oC for 3 hours.
If digesting a vector, add 2.5 µl of alkaline phosphatase at 2 hours, and then add a second aliquot at 2.5 hours.
Digests can then be purified using the Qiagen PCR purification kit.
QIAquick PCR purification kit protocol (Qiagen)
Add 5 volumes of buffer PB to 1 volume of PCR reaction.
Put sample in QIAquick column, centrifuge for 1 min at 13 000 rpm and discard flow-through.
Add 750 µl of buffer PE to the column and centrifuge for 1 min, discard flow through.
Centrifuge again for 1 min to remove residual buffer.
Place column in clean Eppendorf.
To elute DNA, add 50 µl of water to the centre of the QIAquick membrane and centrifuge for 1 min.
Polymerase Chain Reaction
1. Ligation reactions set up as follows:
2. Incubated at room temperature for 3 hours and then transform into chemically competent E. coli cells.
Plasmid DNA Miniprep
Plasmids were isolated using a QIAprep Spin Miniprep Kit protocol (Qiagen).
Spin down overnight culture of cells for 5 minutes at 4000 rpm and discard supernatant.
Resuspend the resulting pellet in 250 µl of buffer P1 (with RNase A added) and transfer to a clean eppendorf.
Add 250 µl of buffer P2 and mix.
Add 350µ l of buffer N3 and mix.
Centrifuge samples for 10 min and 13 000 rpm in table top centrifuge.
Apply the supernatant to QIAprep spin column by decanting or pipetting and centrifuge at 13 000 rpm for 1 min and discard the flow-through.
Wash QIAprep spin column in 500 µl of buffer PB, centrifuge at 13 000 rpm for 1 min and discard flow through (optional).
Wash spin column with 750 µl buffer PE and centrifuge at 13 000 rpm for 1 min and discard flow through.
Centrifuge at 13 000 rpm for 1 min to remove residual buffer.
Place column in clean Eppendorf and elute with 50 µl of water, let sit for 3 min, centrifuge for 1 min at 13 000 rpm.
Colony PCR
Colony PCR was used to identify the desired clones on a plate of transformed cells. PCR was performed on samples using Taq polymerase supplied by Aligent Technologies.
A single colony was picked and re- suspended in 30 μl of ddH2O. The cells were boiled for 10 min and then centrifuged for 1 min at 13 000 rpm in a microfuge. 5 μl of DNA was then used as part of the reaction mixture outlined below.
Glycerol Stock
Pick single colony from agar plate.
Inoculate 5 ml LB broth overnight (with appropriate antibiotic).
Add 1 ml of overnight culture to 1 ml of 60% glycerol in a cryotube (1:1 ratio).
Freeze at -80°C.
SDS – PAGE and Western Blot analysis
Protein samples were separated on resolving gels containing 12% acrylamide, and a stacking gel of 6% acrylamide, alongside 5 μl of protein ladder (Precision plus Protein All Blue Standard, Bio-Rad).
For 12% acrylamide gel:
Resolving gel recipe:
After casting the resolving gel, add a layer of isopropanol on top to get rid of any bubbles and keep a straight line on the top. Once the resolving gel is set, the isopropanol can be poured off then the stacking gel added.
Stacking gel recipe:
After adding the stacking gel an appropriate comb was put in place and left to set. Samples ran as follows:
Samples separated in 1 x SDS running buffer at 80 V until samples reached the resolving gel. The voltage was then increased to 180 V until the dye front reached the bottom of the gel.
Proteins were then transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane by semi-dry transfer. This was performed at 5V for 40 min. Place gel between 2 x Whatmann filter paper, nitrocellulose membrane, 2 x Whatmann filter paper all soaked in transfer buffer.
Membrane blocked overnight in 5% semi-skimmed milk dissolved in TBST (Tris-buffered saline, 0.1% Tween20) at 4oC.
Blocking buffer then removed and the primary antibody added to fresh 5% milk in TBST for 1 hour at room temperature.
This was followed by four 15 min wash steps with TBST.
The membrane was then incubated with the secondary antibody (unless primary antibody is conjugated to horseradish peroxidase-HRP-conjugaed) in 5% milk in TBST and incubated at room temperature for 1 hour.
The membrane was again washed four times for 15 min with TBST at room temperature.
Photo-detection of the cross-reacting bands used enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL)reagent (luminol+HRP) and exposure using the GENEGnome.
The following antibody dilutions were used: -GFP 1:2000,  -HA-HRP 1:5000.
Transfer buffer recipe:
0.6g Tris
2.9 g glycine
20 ml methanol
180 ml H20
Subculture of to induce Toxic Expression
To test the toxicity of our toxic chimeras which were cloned into pBAD, we needed to induce the pBAD inducible promoter with arabinose in order to get toxic production.
Overnights of the colonies containing the toxin were taken
250μl of these cells were added to 3 conical flasks containing 25ml of LB and 25μl of kanamycin antibiotic to select for the toxins in the pBAD vector.
The conical flasks were then incubated at 37°C for 1.5 hours, until they reached an OD of between 0.5-0.8A.
In one flask glucose was added to a final concentration of 0.2% glucose, in another final concentration of 0.2% arabinose, and in the 3rd flask 0.5% arabinose.
They were then incubated again at 37°C, and the OD was measured and samples were taken roughly every 40 minutes. The final samples taken were used for western blot.
Preparing samples for western blot
1ml of each sample was spun down in a table top centrifuge for 1 minute.
The pellet was then resuspended in 100μl of laemmeli sample buffer with β-mercaptoethanol (50μl β-mercaptoethanol in 950μl laemmeli).
The samples were then boiled at 95°C for 10 minutes.
Load between 5-15μl of samples into acrylamide protein gel.
TCA precipitation of supernatant samples
Supernatant samples were filter sterilised and made up to 1ml with LB.
Add 5μl deoxycholate (10mg/ml) and 110μl Trichloroacetic acid (TCA) (1g/ml).
Samples were mixed thoroughly and kept on ice in cold room for a minimum of 3 hours.
They were then centrifuged at 4°C at 11,000g, with the lids of the Eppendorf all facing inwards.
Remove supernatant (put TCA in TCA waste)
500μl of 80% ethanol were pipetted on inside of Eppendorf, without disturbing the pellet, to wash.
Spin in centrifuge for 5 minutes and remove supernatant.
Dry pellet by leaving them on 37°C heat block with lids open for 20 mins.
Pellet then resuspended in 50μl Tris-SDS.
50μl of laemmeli sample buffer with β-mercaptoethanol (50μl β-mercaptoethanol in 950μl laemmeli) was then added and samples were boiled at 95°C for 10 minutes.
Preparation of promoter-GFP samples for western blotting
The OD600 of the over night incubated promoter constructs was measured (450µl fresh LB and 50µl of the over night culture per cuvette; 500µl fresh LB as a Blank; then calculate actual OD600)
The cultures were pelleted 13000 rpm for 7 minutes
Normalised to an OD600 of 1 with Lamelli buffer
15µl from the Lamelli buffered samples was loaded into each well of the 12% Acrylamide protein gel
Follow procedure for SDS-PAGE and Western Blot Analysis
Measurement of GFP and OD600 using Plate Reader
Measurement of GFP fluorescence from our pH promoter – gfp constructs.
Overnight cultures harbouring the pSB1C3-Pasr-gfp, P-gadA-gfp, PacrRA-gfp were diluted 1/10 into 1 x MOPS buffered LB (to various pH conditions with either concentration H2SO4 or NaOH).
The adjusted pH values were pH 2, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8. The 1 x MOPS buffered LB was then filter sterilised.
3. 200 µl loaded into 96 well plate and the OD600 as well as GFP fluorescence was measured (ex:em) over 20 hour every 20 min.
Measurement of GFP fluorescence from our bile salt promoter – gfp construct.
Overnight cultures harbouring the pSB1C3- PacrRA-gfp construct samples (for details on which were used view ‘LETTER CODE’ below table) were normalised to an OD of 1 with minimal media
6µl of the over night normalised cultured were transferred into each well from row A to D column 1 to 12.
A 1mM stock of Sodium Cholate – in sterile water was diluted to concentrations of 5µg/ml, 10µg/ml and 25µg/ml with minimal media and the normalised cultures. (the final concentration in well columns 1-3 was 25µg/ml in 200µl. The 200µl includes the 6µl from the over night normalised samples.
OD600 as well as GFP fluorescence was measured (ex:em) over 20 hour every 20 mins.
GFP Fluorescence Detection Using the Microscope:
This protocol was used to measure the GFP fluorescence of our bile salt promoter construct PacrRA-gfp.
Competent MG1655 cells were transformed with pUniprom-RamA and PacrRA-gfp. RamA acts as the transcriptional activator. In order to investigate the effect of RamA, sufficicent control transformations were also set up.
The standard transformation protocol was followed and cells finally plated onto LB agar or MacConkey containing 2 x Amp/ 2x Cml.
Transformations incubated overnight at 37oC.
GFP fluorescence was viewed with the fluorescence microscope (for quantitative measurements the plate reader was used)
E. coli Toxicity Assay
Plate toxicity experiments were carried out to test the toxicity of our synthetic toxins. Expression of our synthetic colicins in E. coli MG1655 was under the control of the L-arabinose-inducible, D-glucose-repressible pBAD promoter on vector pBAD18-Kn.
Plasmids required for the experiment were transformed into MG1655 chemically competent cells and plated onto LB containing 0.2% D-glucose and incubated at 37oC overnight.
The following day colonies were picked and re-suspended in LB to a calculated OD600 of 1.0.
Serial dilutions 1:10 to 10-6 were prepared and 5 µl of each dilution spotted onto LB plated containing 0.2% D-glucose, and increasing concentrations of L-arabinose (0.02%, 0.2%, 0.4%).
The plates were then incubated overnight at 37oC.
E. coli Toxicity Assay
We were unable to see any toxicity from our synthetic toxins when they were overexpressed in E. coli . This may be due to the fact that our warheads on our synthetic colicins degrade the peptidoglycan wall and if the toxin is not secreted it will not reach its target. We were unable to see any secretion of our synthetic toxins and so we decided to lyse our cells and release our toxins and test for toxicity against E. coli . The overexpression of our synthetic toxins protocol was followed and then lysis as follows:
25 ml of 0D600 = 2.0 of MG1655 cells harbouring pBAD18-Kn with our synthetic toxins were pelleted by centrifugation at 4000rpm.
The pellets were resuspended in 1.5 ml of 1 x PBS.
The cells were lysed for 1.5 min using a sonicator (20% amplitude, 3 x 30sec).
MG1655 E. coli cells were plated onto LB agar plates using a cotton bud (this acts as our target for our synthetic colicins).
Lysed MG1655 cells with our pBAD18-Kn synthetic toxin constructs were then spun down to remove any cell debris.
5 µl of cell lysate was spotted onto the plate of MG1655 E. coli cells.
Positive and negative controls were also spotted alongside our synthetic toxins.
Spots were dried by a flame and then incubated overnight at 37°C.
