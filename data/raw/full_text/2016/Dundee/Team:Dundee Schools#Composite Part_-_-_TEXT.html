BBa_K1963007 (Device for rhamnose-dependent expression of an OsmY.)
An assembled device that contains a rhamnose-responsive promoter, a strong RBS and a biobrick encoding the E. coli OsmY protein.
BBa_K1963008 (Device for rhamnose-dependent expression of an OsmY fusion to E. coli Hfq.)
A composite of three BioBricks to give rhamnose-regulated expression of an sRNA secretion system - a translational fusion between E. coli OsmY and E. coli Hfq.
BBa_K1963009 (Device for rhamnose-dependent expression of an OsmY fusion to Serratia Hfq.)
A rhamnose-regulated device based on existing and new (2016) BioBricks. This is designed to induce production of a fusion protein between E. coli OsmY (a secreted protein) and Serratia marcescens Hfq (an RNA binding protein). Co-expression with Serratia sRNA may generate a specific RNA secretion system.
