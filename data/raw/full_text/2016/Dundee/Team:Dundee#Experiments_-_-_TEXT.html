Dundee 2016
Bronze
1. We have registered the team, had a great summer and plan to have fun at the Jamboree.
2. We have met all deliverables, documented our work on the wiki page, plan to present a poster and presentation at the Jamboree.
We have also attributed all of the work done for our project.
We have also created and documented our Part pages on the Registry for the Parts
We have submitted. And all part samples have been submitted to the Registry.
We have completed the following forms: About Our Lab, About Project, Final Safety Form and the Judging Form.
3. We have clearly attributed each aspect of our project.
4. We have documented the following BioBrick Parts:
BBa_K1962000
BBa_K1962001
BBa_K1962002
BBa_K1962004
BBa_K1962005
BBa_K1962006
BBa_K1962015
BBa_K1962016
BBa_K1962017
Silver
1. We have experimentally validated that at least one new BioBrick Part of our own design works as expected.
BBa_K1962003
BBa_K1962007
BBa_K1962008
BBa_K1962009
BBa_K19620010
BBa_K19620011
BBa_K19620012
BBa_K19620013
BBa_K19620014
2. We have helped other iGEM teams by characterizing a part, mentoring a high school team and attending iGEM meetups.
3. Human practices – silver. Identified and investigated important issues including the sustainability of antibiotics, public concerns on the ethics of using GMOs. We were also involved in organizing a debate with the Edniburgh iGEM team to tackle some misconceptions that the public had on GMOs.
Gold
1. Human practices - gold. Our initial idea was to target infections that cause food poisoning, however we gained valuable feedback from our human practices which made us think about targeting infections at the source of the problem. We also created a BactiFeed product in the lab to explore the real world applications of the device.
2. We have improved the characterization of a number of parts and documented them in the parts page on the registry.
- Improved the characterization of two pH sensitive promoters. We improved them by cloning GFP downstream of the two promoters and measuring GFP fluorescence in different pH conditions.
Pasr- BBa_K1231000
PgadA – BBa_K1231001
BBa_E0840
- We have also improved the characterization of the P acrRA . By cloning the gfp gene downstream and measuring gfp fluorescence.
Pasr- BBa_K1231000
3. We have created a piece of hardware that will mimic the churning motion in the gut of a chicken in order to test our bactifeed.
