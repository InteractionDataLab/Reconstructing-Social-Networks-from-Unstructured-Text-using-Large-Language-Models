As seen in our demonstrate and proof-of-concept pages we have assembled BabbleBricks together into BabbleBlocks. Here you can see bands showing BabbleBricks of various different sizes. These have anchor and terminator sequences, which contain BsmBI sites. Digestion of these sites allow insertion of the device into a phytobrick plasmid.   The function of a BabbleBlock is to store data. To validate our devices we are looking for their presence after assembly. We are further validating their use as storage devices by sequencing. These results will be in on 20th October 2016.
