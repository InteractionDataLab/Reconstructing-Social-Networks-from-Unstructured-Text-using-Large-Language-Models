Here you can find zip files containing all the code for the BabblED software along with handy documentation about how to install the programs. Alternatively all the code is also available completely open source on our Github or if you would just like to see the software in action head over to our software page for a walkthrough.
All the files below were written in Python 2.7 and also require the SciPy stack. For Windows and Mac users we recommend to install Anaconda - "a leading data science platform powered by Python" in order to run the programs. Linux users will simply need to install the SciPy Stack
Here you can download a zip containing all the files essential to the main BabblED software, simply unpack the zip and run gui.py inside to get started:
