Using these and the incredible properties of DNA we can be confident in accurately storing archival data for 10s or even 100s of years.</CENTRE><CENTRE style="font-size:160%;">You can read more about all these mechanisms below or jump straight into the code at our <A href="https://github.com/Edinburgh-iGEM2016/Error-Correction" target="_self">Github</A></CENTRE></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="container-fluid"><DIV class="col-cm-8"><DIV id="accordian" class="panel-group"><DIV class="panel panel-default"><DIV class="panel-heading"><H4 class="panel-title"><A data-toggle="collapse" data-parent="#accordion" href="#collapseOne">Checksum</A></H4></DIV><DIV id="collapseOne" class="panel-collapse collapse"><DIV class="panel-body"><P>A checksum is a commonly used technique in network engineering that we’ve adapted for use in DNA storage. In this format the checksum allows the detection of errors in a BabbleBlock (DNA sentence). The checksum holds the sum of the word coding regions of BabbleBricks (DNA words) in a BabbleBlock in a 4 BabbleBrick region that can be found towards the end of a BabbleBlock.</P><P>When a BabbleBlock is being translated the checksum is looked at first to see if it matches the sums of the word coding regions in the DNA we get back from sequencing. If this is the case, no errors have appeared and the translation program can proceed as normal however if there is no match an error has occurred somewhere in the BabbleBlock and other error correcting mechanisms will have to be used to make sure the stored information can still be read back.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="panel panel-default"><DIV class="panel-heading"><H4 class="panel-title"><A data-toggle="collapse" data-parent="#accordion" href="#collapseTwo">Improved Checksum - Collaboration with Exeter University</A></H4></DIV><DIV id="collapseTwo" class="panel-collapse collapse"><DIV class="panel-body"><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-sm-6">Fig1</DIV><DIV class="col-sm-6">Fig2</DIV></DIV><P>Currently a checksum utilizes only a small percentage of the values that can be stored.
			A BabbleBrick contains 5 base 4 digits meaning that 4^5B unique bits of
			information share one of 15B checksums where B is the amount of BabbleBricks in one
			BabbleBlock. This data has been plotted for BabbleBlocks containing 2 and 3 BabbleBricks
			in Fig.1 and Fig.2 respectively. Assuming that between the time of writing and reading
			any number of mutations can occur, the maximum probability of a mutation event resulting
			in the same checksum can be calculated by comparing the frequency of one checksum to the
			total frequency of unique bits of information.</P><P>
			Therefore, it can be predicted that for an average sentence containing 9 words the maximum
			probability of the same checksum occurring will be of the magnitude of 1%. The probability
			should decrease marginally when adding BabbleBricks due to the slightly increased range of
			checksums that become available. This value can be optimized by altering the method of the
			checksum to utilize a greater range of values and to spread out the frequency more evenly as
			to reduce the maximum probability of the same checksum occurring.
		</P><P>
			Currently one BabbleBlock has 4 BabbleBricks dedicated to storing the checksum, giving a maximum
			10^4 possible values. The first step in determining a ‘CheckMethod’ is to ensure that all checksums
			for a suitable amount of BabbleBricks can be stored without going over 10^4. It is also important
			to not use operators that will result in negative numbers or decimals, therefore limiting the
			possible checksum values to integers up to but not including 10^4, this rules out operators such
			as subtract and divide. For this example, a suitable number of words in a sentence and therefore
			BabbleBricks in a BabbleBlock shall be 20. All simulations will be carried out on 3 BabbleBrick
			systems due to computing limitations.
		</P><P>
			Checksums are non-directional, for example a BabbleBrick of bases [2,2,2,2,2] would have the
			same checksum as [2,1,3,2,2].  To alter this a checkmethod will incorporate the position
			of the base in to the calculation. At each point the digit is multiplied by its position
			in the BabbleBlock, where the first BabbleBrick has digit positions 1 to 5 and the last
			BabbleBrick (20th}) has positions 96 to 100. A scaler alpha has been included to
			increase the range of results. To ensure multiplications don’t result in a null result
			the value of each base had a value of 1 added to it. The first checkmethod of one
			BabbleBlock can be defined as:
		</P><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-sm-6">Fig3</DIV><DIV class="col-sm-6">Fig4</DIV></DIV></DIV><P>
			This method results in Fig.3 and Fig.4 for a 2 and 3 BabbleBlock system respectively,
			which shows a large improvement over the original checksum method. The maximum frequency
			of a single checksum has been significantly decreased which will lower the probability of
			a false positive occurring; this is largely due to the large range of results available to
			the method. However, there is still room for improvement as the shaded area of the graph
			indicates that on a smaller scale the frequency of checkmethod 1 varies between high and low
			values. Eliminating this fluctuation would allow for the data to be spread out more evenly.
			To improve this
			method a second layer of multiplication will be implemented, each digit will
			now be multiplied by a constant depending on its relative position in the BabbleBrick.
		</P><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-sm-6">Fig5</DIV><DIV class="col-sm-6">Fig6</DIV></DIV><P>
			This has been plotted for a 2 and 3 BabbleBlock system in Fig.5 and Fig.6 respectively.
			When comparing checksum to checkmethod 2 the frequency peak is approximately 20 to 30
			times smaller in both cases whilst utilizing more values. In Fig.5 and Fig.6 the largest
			improvement using the second iteration of the checkmethod is the utilization of every
			integer value, checkmethod 1 appears shaded as the frequency varies frequently. The last
			step is to test checkmethod 2 when used in a babbleBlock containing 20 BabbleBricks; the
			largest value possible assuming a BabbleBlock containing the value ‘3’ in each digit will
			grant a value of 60600 which falls out of the current limit of 10^4 values. Therefore,
			it is recommended that one more BabbleBrick is added to the end of the BabbleBlock in order
			to store 10^5 values.
		</P><P>
			To improve this method  further more complex multiplications could be added, it would be
			a decision based on optimising efficiency of calculations and minimising false positives.
			In a 2 and 3 BabbleBrick system the probability of a false positives occurring was reduced by
			approximately 20 and 30 times respectively, although the numbers are too large to compute,
			this new method has the possibility of lowering the maximum false positive error of the previously
			used checksum by one or more orders of magnitude.
