The University of Edinburgh Undergraduate iGEM team 2016 presents:
The Next Generation of Information Storage
Density
DNA has 1000 times the
density of flash storage
Affordability
All our encoding programmes
are open source and initial
synthesis of the lexicon is done
for you providing significant
cost reductions on existing
methods
Longevity
DNA can last for
thousands of years
without consuming
resources; modern
hard drives can only
last 50
Modularity
Assembly of our BabbleBricks
is unrestricted and completely
customisable

Abstract
In 2014, over 10 sextillion bits of data were digitally stored worldwide. To put this in context, there are only 1 sextillion grains of sand on this entire Earth. According to IBM, we generate over 2.5 billion gigabytes daily through tweets, emails and Facebook posts! The University of Edinburgh’s undergraduate team has designed a DNA storage system that is a sustainable, dense and long-lasting alternative to magnetic tape data storage. The storage system relies on modular DNA fragments that can flexibly and cost effectively store any type of data. Modularity makes BabblED the cheapest and most accessible DNA storage system available. The system also boasts new and novel techniques to incorporate error-correcting and encryption in DNA storage. In fact, this ‘DNA Typewriter’ has already been implemented by the National Library of Scotland to archive one of their most precious manuscripts: the last letter of Mary Queen of Scots.
