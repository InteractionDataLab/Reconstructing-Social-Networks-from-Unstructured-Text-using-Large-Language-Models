Mary Queen of Scots
Early in the summer we met with Lee Hibberd from the National Library of Scotland to discuss our project, and get his feedback about our method and how applicable it would be for a place like the National Library that archives all types of data.
We were so thrilled when he offered us an opportunity to collaborate with the National Library and actually store one of their manuscripts in our BabbleBricks. The chosen manuscript was the last letter written by Mary Queen of Scots before her execution for supposedly plotting to kill Queen Elizabeth of England.
As a result of our collaboration with the library, we have extended the way in which we have demonstrated our work by actually archiving a piece of text in our DNA data storage method.
To read more about our collaboration with the Library you can read their press release here , or watch this video .
