Detail
Register and Attend
Register for iGEM, have a great summer and attend the giant Jamboree.
We have registered, had an amazing summer, and are so excited to head to Boston soon! Watch us present in Sunday, 3.30pm Room 304.
Deliverables
Meet all deliverables.
Wiki, Poster, Presentation, Attributions, Registry Part pages, Sample Submission, Safety forms and Judging forms.
Attribution
Create a page on your team wiki with clear attribution of each aspect of your project. This page must clearly attribute work done by the students and distinguish it from work done by others, including host labs, advisors, instructors, sponsors, professional web designers, artists and commercial services.
Our attribution page shows the excellent work every team member has done this summer, as well as all the help we have gratefully received form other people.
Part/Conribution
Document at least one new standard BioBrick Part or Device central to your project and submit to the iGEM Registry(submissions must adhere to iGEM guidelines). You may also document a new application of a BioBrick part from a previous iGEM year, adding that documentation to the part main page.
Our part BBa_K19670001 which encodes the digit 0.
Validated Part/Validated Contribution
Experimentally validate that at least one new BioBrick Part or device of your own design and construction works as expected. Document the characterization of this part in the Main Page section of that Part's/Device's Registry entry. Submit this new part to the iGEM Parts Registry. This working part must be different from the part documented in bronze medal criteria.
Our part BBa_K19670000 is the first ever BabbleBrick! It is a phytobrick which we have designed and used for modular data assembly.
Collaboration
Convince the judges you have helped any registered iGEM team from high school, a different track, another university, or another institution in a significant way by, for exampe, mentoring a new team, characterizing a part, debugging a construct, modelling/simulating their system or helping validate a software/hardware solution to a synbio problem.
See our collaboration page here for details.
Human Practices
iGEM projects involve important questions beyond the lab bench, for example relating to (but not limited to)ethics, sustainability, social justice, safety, security, and intellectual property. Demonstrate how your team has idetified, investigated, and addressed one or more of these issues in the context of your project. Your activity could center around education, public engagement, public policy issues, public perception, or other activities.
All of our human practices pages document the hard work we have undertaken to ensure our data storage system is safe for use.
Integrated Human Practices
Expand on your silver medal activity by demonstrating how you have integrated the investigated issues into the design and/or execution of your project.
Our human practices pages document the integration of our development process with our end users. We engaged with many data librarians, security experts, and social scientists to truly understand the needs if potential consumers. This allowed us to integrate these needs into our design.
Improve a previous part of project
Improve the function or characterization of an existing BioBrick Part or Device and enter this information in the Registry. Please see the Registry help page on how to document a contribution to an existing part. This part must NOT be from your 2016 part number range.
We are submitting a codon optimised phytobrick for DNA binding protein, previously submitted bricks for Dps can be found here and here .
Proof of concept
Demonstrate a functional proof of concept of your project. Your proof of concept must consist of a BioBrick device; a single BioBrick part cannot constitute a proof of concept. (biological materials may not be taken outside of the lab)
Our functional proof-of-concept shows the assembly of BabbleBricks (single phytobricks) into BabbleBlocks (a device).
Demonstrate Your Work
Show your project working under real-world conditions. To achieve this criterion, you should demonstrate your whole system, or a functional proof of concept working under simulated conditions in the lab (biological materials may not be taken outside the lab).
Our project demonstrated under real world conditions was a multi-step process focusing on BabbleBrick creation, assembly, consumer storage and data read back
