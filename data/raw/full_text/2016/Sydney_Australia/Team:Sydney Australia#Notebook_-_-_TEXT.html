Met up for the first time and were introduced to the project. Started to do some research on the project
Week 2: 18 April - 24 April
Wet Lab
Started to plan how we were going to approach the wet lab work: What reporter gene would we use to signify the presence of ethylene? How would we clone EtnR1 and EtnR2 into a plasmid to produce a functional construct?
Planned to split the wet lab team into subgroups for each arm of the wet lab work.
Started to do research on cell-based biosensors, cell-free paper-based biosensors, and other possible biosensor designs

Literature review of 2 component regulatory systems. Discovered a LOT of existing mathematical biology literature, but the focus generally seems to be on the abstract mathematical theory behind gene regulation and not applicable to lab/practical work.
Human Practices
Met iGEM USYD 2015, and got lots of advice about pressure points to watch out for throughout the season.
Week 8: 30 May - 5 June

Week 9: 6 June - 12 June
Wet Lab
Ordered new gBlocks containing ribosome binding sites.
Amanda and Orion: Decided to clone EtnR1 and EtnR2 into pET28c instead of pBBRIMCS-2, as it would allow the addition of an N-terminal hexahistidine tag for easy protein purification and downstream characterisation experiments.

Sing-young and Alma: Started fourth round of amilCP error-prone PCR.
Dry Lab
Transcription parameters: found Etr1-GST values for DNA binding activity. However, these are in units of radioactivity “counts” so they must be converted to a rate constant to be applicable to our model.

Amanda and Orion:
Continued to troubleshoot EtnR1 purification.
Finalised the cloning plan for assembling the final construct, and started cloning
Claudia and Sing-young:
Carried out gas chromatography to test EtnR2 binding to ethylene, using whole cells and cell extracts – Results did not show that EtnR2 was binding to ethylene; concluded that the assay was not suitable to test binding, as EtnR2 could be binding and releasing ethylene too quickly to be measured through gas chromatography
Alma:
Finished sequence analysis of amilCP mutants and decided on mutants to submit as parts.
Dry Lab
Contacted Hamburg iGEM2016 for parameters governing their two component regulatory system. Exchanged ideas for both our team’s modelling. Found that they were focused on an external model predicting the fluid flow behaviour in their micro device. However, their parameters were only available in arbitrary “docking score” units. Shouldn’t be a problem, we can still create a model with output in arbitrary units.
Contacted Hamburg IGEM2016 for smartphone app collaboration. Discovered that they have very similar requirements for their biosensor as ours and the smartphone app could potentially be used for their system as well.

Completed Hamburg iGEM2016 smartphone app.
Week 25: 26 September - 2 October
Wet Lab
Amanda, Orion, Sing-young and Claudia:
