	We created new parts building on the function of the BBa_K592009 part (amilCP, a blue chromoprotein) from the 2011 Upsala team through error prone PCR. Check this out here!

All of the teams exchanged ideas about progress and the content of the wiki, poster and presentations. We also explored avenues through which we could collaboratively help each other such as through research, modelling and outreach. Each team brought something new to the table, and we rounded up proceedings with a good old sausage sizzle and social drinks. Thank you to all the other teams for coming and having such a great time! </P></DIV><DIV class="boxAll"><H2>  Hamburg, Germany: Phone App and Modelling Collaboration </H2></DIV><DIV class="boxLeft"><P> WritingWritingWriting WritingWriting Writing Writing Writing WritingWriting Writing WritingWritingWriting WritingWriting Writing Writing Writing WritingWriting Writing WritingWritingWriting WritingWriting Writing Writing Writing WritingWriting Writing WritingWritingWriting WritingWriting Writing Writing Writing WritingWriting Writing WritingWritingWriting WritingWriting Writing Writing Writing WritingWriting Writing  </P></DIV><DIV class="boxAll"><H2>  UNSW, Australia: Protein Expression + His-Tag and GMO Legalities Collaboration</H2></DIV><DIV class="boxLeft"><P> We traded expertise in protein work with the UNSW team. We attempted to express two of their proteins (G3P and PP3) using our pET28c plasmid in BL21 (DE3, pGro7) E. coli. given our success in expressing our two mycobacterial proteins EtnR1 and EtnR2 using this system. We also gave them strains of E. coli. that overexpress membrane proteins for their work on outer membrane vesicles. The UNSW team performed a Western Blot for us using anti-His antibody conjugated to HRP to verify our proteins were expressed with a His6-Tag. 
Additionally we both looked at the laws surrounding the use of GMOs in Australia and in other countries such as the contrast between developed countries and developing countries.
 
We also shared progress and experiences through an informal meet-up overflowing with laughs and pizza!

We wrote about the misconception that antibiotics can treat all infections, like the common cold or the flu, and the misconception that all E. coli are dangerous. </P></DIV><DIV class="boxAll"><H2> 
Skype meeting(s) with iGEM Toronto, Auckland and NCKU-Tainan </H2></DIV><DIV class="boxLeft"><P> Despite being from land down under, we conducted skype meetings with a variety of other iGEM teams to discuss our projects so far, and to share any advice and learning experiences that we’ve had. It was great to learn so much about the brilliant work going on in other labs and super-exciting to see all the potential improvements synbio can bring to the world! </P><P> Specifically, we shared ideas and codes for phone apps for readout of reporter protein biosensing systems with iGEM Toronto. We also exchanged thoughts about biosensor design, particularly on having cell-free extracts on paper. We love your project on gold – in this case, all that glitters is definitely gold!   </P></DIV><DIV class="boxRight"><P> With iGEM Auckland, we shared protocols for protein expression and His-Tag purification and also collaborated on contacting industry partners relevant to each other’s respective projects.
