Ethylene is an important gaseous hormone involved in the ripening of agriculturally important fruits like bananas, apples, pears, kiwi fruits and avocados. Unofrtunately, in the modern world, where fruit is stored for long periods of time and shipped around the world, small amounts of ethylene can cause unwanted ripening and spoilage. In order to control this, we need to be able to detect when ethylene is being produced. However, current methods of sensing ethylene are expensive, complex, or lack specificity. This year, iGEM USYD has set out to tackle this problem by designing a cell-based (and eventually a cell-free) biosensor to detect ethylene. We have designed a system in E. coli to sense ethylene, using proteins from Mycobacterium NBB4, and express a bright blue chromoprotein upon detection. Working together, our system is a revolutionary way to keep fruit fresh, saving time, money and valuable resources.
A biosensor that detects the presence of sequence specific antibiotic resistance genes.
A safe and specific high-throughput drug screening method that targets essential mycobacterial metabolic proteins.
A phage system with low fitness cost producing sRNA, which inhibits the synthesis of antibiotic resistance proteins.
Infiltrate macrophages with an E.coli producing TDMH, an enzyme that will lyse the Mycobacteria cell wall.
