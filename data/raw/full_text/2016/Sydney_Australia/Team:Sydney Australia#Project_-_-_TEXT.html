Here we present a genetic odor palette. It is built of BioBricks to express enzymes to produce volatile compounds with characteristic smells. We included smells with different tonalities to allow exploration of the "odor space" resulting from combinations of smelly units.

Trimethylaminuria (TMAU) is a rare genetic disease causing a strong fish odor to appear in the sweat. Here we engineer skin bacteria to degrade trimethylamine, the odor causing molecule, with the enzyme TMM (trimethylamine monooxygenase).
