Improvement of pre-existing iGEM parts
   We created new parts building on the function of the BBa_K592009 part (amilCP, a blue chromoprotein) from the 2011 Upsala team through error prone PCR. Check this out here!
iGEM Australia Meet Up
iGEM USYD hosted the other Australian teams from the University of New South Wales, Macquarie University and the University of Melbourne to share and discuss the hard work done by each team. All of the teams exchanged ideas about progress and the content of the wiki, poster and presentations. We also explored avenues through which we could collaboratively help each other such as through research, modelling and outreach. Each team brought something new to the table, and we rounded up proceedings with a good old sausage sizzle and social drinks. Thank you to all the other teams for coming and having such a great time!

UNSW, Australia: Protein Expression + His-Tag and GMO Legalities Collaboration
We traded expertise in protein work with the UNSW team. We attempted to express two of their proteins (G3P and PP3) using our pET28c plasmid in BL21 (DE3, pGro7) E. coli. given our success in expressing our two mycobacterial proteins EtnR1 and EtnR2 using this system. We also gave them strains of E. coli. that overexpress membrane proteins for their work on outer membrane vesicles. The UNSW team performed a Western Blot for us using anti-His antibody conjugated to HRP to verify our proteins were expressed with a His6-Tag.  Additionally we both looked at the laws surrounding the use of GMOs in Australia and in other countries such as the contrast between developed countries and developing countries.
We also shared progress and experiences through an informal meet-up overflowing with laughs and pizza!
Michigan, USA: Misconceptions of SynBio Articles
We contributed two articles to the Michigan iGEM team’s website about common misconceptions in the synthetic biology world. We wrote about the misconception that antibiotics can treat all infections, like the common cold or the flu, and the misconception that all E. coli are dangerous.
Skype meeting(s) with iGEM Toronto, Auckland and NCKU-Tainan
Despite being from land down under, we conducted skype meetings with a variety of other iGEM teams to discuss our projects so far, and to share any advice and learning experiences that we’ve had. It was great to learn so much about the brilliant work going on in other labs and super-exciting to see all the potential improvements synbio can bring to the world!
Specifically, we shared ideas and codes for phone apps for readout of reporter protein biosensing systems with iGEM Toronto. We also exchanged thoughts about biosensor design, particularly on having cell-free extracts on paper. We love your project on gold – in this case, all that glitters is definitely gold!
With iGEM Auckland, we shared protocols for protein expression and His-Tag purification and also collaborated on contacting industry partners relevant to each other’s respective projects. We reached out to waste management companies and thought leaders in Sydney for the Auckland team, and they reached out to horticultural companies in Auckland for us to get advice from!

The USYD iGEM Survey
We had a great response from the iGEM community about our survey! Every team we talked to was more than happy to answer our survey and to distribute it amongst their friends and contacts! We had responses from the following countries:
Australia
USA
Germany
Instagram
Instagram was a super platform for communication of scientific ideas and procedures, not only to the general public, but also with other iGEM teams.
USYD Primer Design App
We had a similarly great response from the iGEM community about our primer design app. We asked for DNA sequences and their corresponding primers to test the primer design app that we developed! Thanks to the following teams for giving us a whole heap of A, C, G and Ts:
UNSW
Macquarie University
