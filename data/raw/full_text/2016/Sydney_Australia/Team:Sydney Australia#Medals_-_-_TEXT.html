HP Gold
✔ Integrated human practices extensively informed our project and its development, and our outreach program was extremely successful. Look here!
Improve a previous iGEM project.
✔ Check out the express page to see how we improved amilCP, originally developed by Uppsala Sweden 2011.
Prototype
✔ Not only did we make a working prototype app which can be used to measure ethylene concentration through amilCP expression, we helped team Hamburg develop their own app for Chlamydia diagnosis. Check it out here
Part Data
✔ EtnR1 was successfully characterised as a transcription factor for enzymes involved in the ethylene degradation pathway in Mycobacterium NBB4! Validation found on our sense page , and in the registry here
