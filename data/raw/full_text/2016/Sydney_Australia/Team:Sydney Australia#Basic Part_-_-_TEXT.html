Team:Sydney Australia/Basic Part
A basic part is a functional unit of DNA that cannot be subdivided into smaller component parts. <a href=" http://parts.igem.org/wiki/index.php/Part:BBa_R0051 ">BBa_R0051</a> is an example of a basic part, a promoter regulated by lambda cl.
Most genetically-encoded functions have not yet been converted to BioBrick parts. Thus, there are many opportunities to find new, cool, and important genetically encoded functions, and refine and convert the DNA encoding these functions into BioBrick standard biological parts.
Note
This page should list all the basic parts your team has made during your project. You must add all characterization information for your parts on the Registry. You should not put characterization information on this page.
