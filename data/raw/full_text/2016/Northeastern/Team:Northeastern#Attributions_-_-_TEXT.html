The Northeastern iGEM Team is grateful to the following people and organizations who have supported and assisted us with our research project throughout the course of this summer.
Professor Carolyn Lee-Parsons
Carolyn W.T. Lee-Parsons is an Associate Professor at Northeastern University, jointly appointed between the departments of Chemical Engineering and Chemistry / Chemical Biology. Her research interests involve engineering the metabolism and regulation of natural products from cultures of medicinal plants and biofuels from microalgae to improve the supply of critical pharmaceutical compounds and the productivity of biofuels.
Professor Veronica Godoy-Carter
Veronica Godoy-Carter is an Associate Professor at Northeastern University. Her research group is interested in studying a multiple protein complex formed by components involved in important DNA transactions when cells are exposed to DNA damage. This is a condition that induces the expression of error-prone DNA polymerases, the activity of which might lead to mutations. Their long-term goal is to learn about the mechanisms that regulate the activity of error-prone Y family DNA polymerases. They use bacteria as a model system and especially Escherichia coli. Due to its relative simplicity, studying basic processes in bacteria will render mechanistic insights that would be difficult to attain directly in more complex systems.
Integrated DNA Technologies (IDT)
The Northeastern iGEM Team would like to thank IDT for the free synthesis of 20kB of gBlocks® Gene Fragments. Without this generous gift much of our work would not have been possible.
Aaron Moskoff at Northeastern 3D Print Studio
Thank you to Aaron Moskoff for laser cutting parts used in our MEC and for providing technical advice for the building of our MEC chamber.
Northeastern University Department of Biology
Thank you to the Northeastern Department of Biology, in particular Adrian Gilbert, Frauke Argyros, and Corissa Mantooth for helping to provide a lab space to work in and materials to work with. This project couldn’t have moved forward without the patience and effort that was put in to make this happen.
