Blh+PR operon
We placed proteorhodopsin downstream of a composite part designed UNITN-Trento 2015 that expresses β-carotene 15,15’-dioxygenase under the J23100 constitutive Anderson promoter. This part both synthesizes proteorhodopsin and the blh enzyme that cleaves  β-carotene into the retinal chromophore needed for PR to operate as a light-driven proton pump. This is a simpler part than UNITN-Trento’s composite BBa_K1604025 but requires external  β-carotene to function.
Nox translational unit
In order to express and characterise Nox, the novel his-tagged protein coding gene was place under the J23100 promoter. This allows constitutive expression of NADH oxidase enzyme that can be easily purified from cell lysates using ELISA.
