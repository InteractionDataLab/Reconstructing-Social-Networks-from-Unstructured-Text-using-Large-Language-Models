Throughout the course of our project, the Northeastern iGEM Team has collaborated with the following organizations and iGEM teams from other institutions.
Harvard University iGEM Team
The Harvard iGEM team has been a valuable collaborator during the last couple of months. The Northeastern team has worked with the Harvard team to help characterize four of their PETase producing plasmids. These plasmids were characterized using a fluorescence intensity assay after inducing the transfected bacteria with IPTG. Results showed a significant increase in fluorescence in bacteria containing the PETase plasmids as well as a significant decrease in growth when compared to a negative control. The Harvard team has been working  to confirm the expression of our NOX protein in BL21 cells as well as His-tag purifying the protein. We are excited to see the outcome of those experiments and are grateful for the collaboration effort between both Northeastern iGEM and Harvard iGEM.
University of Virginia iGEM Team
Boston University Hardware iGEM Team
The BU iGEM Hardware team generously offered to print a microfluidic for the characterization of our CsiD promoter that can analyze multiple concentrations of various carbon sources in parallel for imaging with a fluorescent microscope. We are thankful for their support.
