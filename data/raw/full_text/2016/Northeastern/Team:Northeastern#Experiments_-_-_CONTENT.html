The protein requires retinal to fold correctly and imbed itself into the cellular membrane and also requires light to activate the proton pump.  We decided to test 4 experimental groups: an active culture induced with beta-carotene and light, one induced with light without beta-carotene, one induced with beta-carotene without light, and the last exposed to neither light nor beta-carotene . The cultures with beta-carotene were given 20uM of beta-carotene. Groups induced with light were incubated exposed to a 200W equivalent LED bulb, which was measured to output .34mW at 520nm perfectly suitable to power proteorhodopsin. Groups not induced with light were wrapped in aluminum-foil to prevent exposure. </P><P>	Our NOX expression system was characterized in a dissolved oxygen assay to measure the impact that the H2O forming NOX had on a sample of aerated PBS. Several attempts were also made to his-tag purify the protein and confirm its presence using SDS-PAGE. </P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV id="words" style="background:#fafafa;padding:50px 0"><DIV class="row" style="padding-top:0px;"><DIV class="col-md-12"><H4>General Growth Curve</H4></DIV></DIV><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-md-12"><DIV class="content"><P>A growth assay was conducted comparing control BL21 <I>E. coli</I> to <I>E. coli</I> transformed with NOX and <I>E. coli</I> transformed with Proteorhodopsin + Blh expression plasmids, BBa_K2182003  and BBa_K2182002 respectively. The main goal of this assay was to compare the metabolic stress of the plasmids and see whether or not the plasmids caused a significant decrease in the growth rate of the chassis bacteria. Cultures were grown with agitation in 2 mL of LB broth at 37 degrees celsius and diluted to an OD600 of 0.1 at the start of analysis. OD600 was taken at 20 minute intervals  for the first 5.5 hours,  with an additional time-point taken at 10 hours.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV id="words" style="background:#fff;padding:50px 0"><DIV class="row" style="padding-top:0px;"><DIV class="col-md-12"><H4>Proteorhodopsin Cytotoxicity Growth Assay</H4></DIV></DIV><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-md-12"><DIV class="content"><P>Cultures of BL21 <I>E. coli</I> were heat-shock transformed with the PR+Blh plasmid. 50 ml of LB + Chloramphenicol (25ug/ml) was added to two falcon tubes before inoculating with the transformed bacteria. Liquid cultures were grown overnight at 37C on a shaking plate before being measured for optical density, combined, and normalized to .28 OD 600. Cultures were then divided into 3 replicates containing  8ml aliquots. The cultures were incubated for twelve hours before measuring OD600 . They were then incubated for an additional twelve hours before measuring OD600 a final time.

Successful proton pumping would be seen as an increase of ATP, so the expected outcome was that the bacteria induced with beta-carotene and grown in the light would have the highest ratio. Transformed cells were grown overnight in 50ul of  LB + Chloramphenicol (25ug/ml) and allowed to grow overnight at 37 degrees celsius. Induced groups were given 20uM beta-carotene and light groups were exposed to a 200W equivalent LED bulb. The liquid culture was then divided into 10ml each of the four experimental groups and allowed to grow at 37 degrees celsius 10 µL of cultured cells were transferred into a 96-well plate, with four replicates in each group. The cells were mixed with 90 µL of ATP reagent per well and the luminescence was read on a plate reader. This value is RLU A. After 10 minutes, the luminescence was read again, to get the RLU B value. 5 µL of ADP reagent were added to each well and mixed, and a final reading was done to obtain the RLU C value. The ATP/ADP ratio was calculated using the formula (RLU C - RLU B) / RLU A.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV id="words" style="background:#fff;padding:50px 0"><DIV class="row" style="padding-top:0px;"><DIV class="col-md-12"><H4>Proteorhodopsin Culture pH Characterization</H4></DIV></DIV><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-md-12"><DIV class="content"><P>BBa_K1282002 transformed BL21 <I>E. coli</I> were grown by shaking overnight at 37C in 30 ml of LB+chloramphenicol.
