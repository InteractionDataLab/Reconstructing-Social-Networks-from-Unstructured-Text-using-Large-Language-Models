The Northeastern team wanted to contribute parts to the iGEM registry that have functionality and novelty in regards to the scope of our project. We hope that future teams will be able to not only find value in these parts but to also expand upon the nature in which they are used.
We have submitted three parts to the iGEM registry and have given a more thorough explanation of the parts below.
