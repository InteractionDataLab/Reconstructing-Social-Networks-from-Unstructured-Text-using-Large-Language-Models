Before the team was granted access to a labspace all team members and advisors underwent several safety training courses from Northeastern University’s Environmental Health and Safety Department. Team organizers worked closely with EHS and other faculty throughout the summer to ensure a safe working environment. Training courses taken by team members included chemical hygiene and laboratory safety, autoclave safety, and biosafety. These courses covered all of the fundamental skills of lab safety including proper use of personal protective equipment, proper treatment of chemicals and biological materials and proper disposal of all of the materials that we would be using in the lab.
Safety hazards were kept to a minimum and no notably dangerous chemicals or biological agents were used.
