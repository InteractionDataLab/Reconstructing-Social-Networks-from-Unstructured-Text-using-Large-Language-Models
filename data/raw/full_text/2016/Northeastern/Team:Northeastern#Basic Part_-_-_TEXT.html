NADH Oxidase
This is a novel part submitted to the registry from the NCBI database, NADH oxidase/NADH dehydrogenase from Streptococcus sanguinis. Nox encodes the H2O-forming NADH oxidase enzyme that catalyses the oxidation of NADH to form water:
4 NADH + O2 → 4 NAD+ + 2 H2O + 4 e-
We also designed a Nox protein with an N-terminus His tag to purify the protein using ELISA (BBa_K2182001), and a modified RBS sequence based on the BBa_K1123010 RBS used by TU Eindhoven 2013 under the FNR promoter. Our version has been optimized to reduce homodimer formation during PCR ( BBa_K2182004 ).
