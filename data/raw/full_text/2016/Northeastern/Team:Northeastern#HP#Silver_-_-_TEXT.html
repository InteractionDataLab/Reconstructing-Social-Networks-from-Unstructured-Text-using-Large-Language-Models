Our team saw a need for improved communication between the scientific community and the public. Much of what makes the mainstream news in bioengineering are dramatic failures, biased promotional studies, and wild exaggerations, and to the average person, genetic engineering may seem unnatural and unsafe. This video, titled “Genetic Engineering: Preparing for the Inevitable” contains all of the necessary information for someone who is untrained to have a knowledgeable and informed opinion on genetic modification, and hopefully quell any worries about its safety. Interviewing three experts with varying backgrounds in ethics, genetic engineering, and genetic manipulation provide a well-rounded outlook on the history, the risks, and the current and future rewards that we may soon be reaping.
