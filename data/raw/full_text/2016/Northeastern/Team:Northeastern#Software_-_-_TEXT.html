Plasmid Builder
A browser-based, interactable plasmid design tool
Plasmid Builder is a GUI for AngularPlasmid , by Vivix, and was created so iGEM teams without AngularJS experience can make visual, interactive plasmids for iGEM wikis (or any other website). Unlike the info-rich but hardly sharable plasmid maps of Geneious, SnapGene, LabGenius, Benchling, Savvy, etc., Plasmid Builder is a web-based tool that simplifies the process of adding and customizing plasmid parts and then exporting as HTML. The components of AngularPlasmid have been wrapped with a constructor so new plasmid parts and tracks can be updated from the browser; the two-way data-binding of AngularJS allows for real time updates and changes.
*There are some features of Vivix’s AngularPlasmid that we left out for the sake of usability, so check out his library if you are comfortable with AngularJS and want additional customizability.

components
View Section
The View component is central to Plasmid Builder. As the parts are added or adjusted in the Parts component, the plasmid map updates to reflect additions, changes, rearrangement, etc. Using the download button, the full plasmid map is exportable as HTML-embeddable SVG elements for inclusion in iGEM wikis.
Parts Section
Parts come with a number of potential customizations. Length can be input as number of BPs, or ending basepair location (can be changed with the settings button). The color and opacity are selectable using the color-selection tool, and the size, direction, and linkable-URL can all be input in the top portion. Existing parts can be edited or deleted entirely.
Design Section
The plasmid’s name, size, width, font, color, font-sizing, tick-count, tick-spacing, etc. can all be customized with the tabs of the plasmid component.
