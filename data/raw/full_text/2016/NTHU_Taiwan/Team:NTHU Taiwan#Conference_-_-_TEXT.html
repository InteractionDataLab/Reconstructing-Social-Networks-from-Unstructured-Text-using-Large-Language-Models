Conference
Communication conference at National Yang-Ming University
August 6th 2016
Participants: Yang-Ming University, Tongji University, Chiao Tung University,
Chang Gung University, Taipei American School, National Chung Cheng University,
Tsing Hua University.
We attended the communication conference. In the conference, each team presented their project and gave some suggestion or shared some novel ideas with each other. We specially enjoyed the World Café event since everyone shared the opinions on different topics such as the attitude toward the life science or what attitude or abilities we thought we should have in such a competitive world.
We thought we had a great interaction with other teams and gained some ideas related to our project after it!
