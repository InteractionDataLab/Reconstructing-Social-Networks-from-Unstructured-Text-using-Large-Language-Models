iGEM X Synthetic Biology exhibition
June 2016
We held an iGEM X synthetic biology exhibition in school library, drawing hundreds of visitors. We aimed to promote the concept of iGEM and synthetic biology to the common people by showing them some basic principles and practical application related to the synthetic biology.
We also made the elements of the biobrick (promoter, RBS, and etc) to let people learn how to complete the whole biobrick by assembling the elements themselves. We also provided the notebook to let people draw their own biobrick. And we got a lot of interesting “biobrick” from the people’s drawings. This was really cool exhibition experience!
Sharing on Scientific American Taiwanese Edition
It’s our honor to be invited to share our experience about iGEM preparation and report fun projects in Giant Jamboree in one column at Scientific American Taiwanese Edition during Giant Jamboree and after we come back to Taiwan.
The article will be post on January 2017 edition. We will share our preparation experience, touching moments and innovative idea presented in Giant Jamboree.
Visit wastewater treatment plant of Hsinchu Science Park
Sep 2016
To evaluate the feasibility of our device, we visited wastewater treatment plant at Hsinchu Science Park. We learned how the plant actually did to purify the wastewater and the common steps of wastewater treatment process in Taiwan.
We also discussed with the staff there about how we could integrate our device into current industrial wastewater treatment. We got some better ideas and showed the details on the device page of our wiki.
Provisional
We applied USA provisional application for patent at August 9th. We want to use legal power to protect our patent right. Thanks to Professor Lai, we consulted Mr. Ge, the manager of Biobizlaw Inc and Patent and Trademark Office for professional advice. He taught us the concept of patent right. He was the one who gave us the idea about applying provision based on our project and financial  status. In the middle of writing process, we consulted Professor Cheng about how to write the legal document step by step. Thanks to their help, we finally finished our provision before we made public at Asia conference in National Cheng Kung University.
In the future, we will try to file a corresponding nonprovisional application for patent.
Questionnaire
We designed a questionnaire to survey public’s knowledge about PFCs. In the questionnaire we inserted multiple video clips and news introducing PFCs and synthetic biology.
Let the public be aware of the danger of PFCs and promote our project at the same time.
Do you understand more about PFCs after you watched the video?
Totally, 85% people understood more about PFCs after finishing the questionnaire.
