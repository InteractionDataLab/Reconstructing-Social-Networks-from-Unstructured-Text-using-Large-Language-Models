iGEM X Synthetic Biology exhibition
June 2016
We held an iGEM X synthetic biology exhibition in school library, drawing hundreds of visitors. We aimed to promote the concept of iGEM and synthetic biology to the common people by showing them some basic principles and practical application related to the synthetic biology.
We also made the elements of the biobrick (promoter, RBS, and etc) to let people learn how to complete the whole biobrick by assembling the elements themselves. We also provided the notebook to let people draw their own biobrick. And we got a lot of interesting “biobrick” from the people’s drawings. This was really cool exhibition experience!
Sharing on Scientific American Taiwanese Edition
It’s our honor to be invited to share our experience about iGEM preparation and report fun projects in Giant Jamboree in one column at Scientific American Taiwanese Edition during Giant Jamboree and after we come back to Taiwan.
The article will be post on January 2017 edition. We will share our preparation experience, touching moments and innovative idea presented in Giant Jamboree.
Questionnaire
We designed a questionnaire to survey public’s knowledge about PFCs. In the questionnaire we inserted multiple video clips and news introducing PFCs and synthetic biology.
Let the public be aware of the danger of PFCs and promote our project at the same time.
Do you understand more about PFCs after you watched the video?
Totally, 85% people understood more about PFCs after finishing the questionnaire.

2015~
At the beginning, we post the recruitment ad on Facebook welcoming freshman to join us. After that, we posted the latest news about igem and our team every week hoping to draw more attention to igem in our school.
Our questionnaire link is also posted on our fan page. Through sharing our questionnaire and finish it, many people know more about PFCs and danger of it The public are more aware about this hazardous environmental pollution.
Workshop
2015
During our recruitment in the begining, our web lab leader started workshop introducing basic concept about synthetic biology and the experiment technique that would be used in iGEM competition preparation.
