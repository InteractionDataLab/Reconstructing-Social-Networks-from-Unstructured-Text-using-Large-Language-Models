Overview
Human practice is the essential part in iGEM competition. We made a good effort to accomplish this part. We grabbed every chance to promote our project, iGEM, and synthetic biology.
We tried a lot to diversify our human practice project. During all activities, we had a great memory and built friendship with other igemers.
Publicity
First, our NTHU_Taiwan held an exhibition at our school library introducing synthetic biology, iGEM competition and our team history and project. It introduced the basic concept of synthetic biology and igem competition.
Next, our team leader Lee Chih-Hsien delivered a talk about synthetic biology and igem in Hsinchuang senior high school. Hope to inspire passion about biology and iGEM in our school and high school student’s heart.
The last one, it’s our honor to be invited to share our experience in iGEM preparation and report innovative projects in one column at Scientific American Taiwanese Edition at January 2017 edition.
Conference
We grabbed every chance to communicate with other teams. We attended three conference during three past months. At National Yang-Ming University we met other seven teams. Next we attended 2016 iGEM Asia Conference with other 19 team experiencing the atmosphere similar to the Giant Jamboree in August.
At September, team HSiTAIWAN and we had a small communication at their school. This year is second time for them to join iGEM. We gained a lot of helpful advice about running a new igem team. We introduced project to the other, sharing the preparing experience during this summer.
At every conference, we met igemers who are also endeavoring for their dreams. Knowing them was really great experience and we become good friends helping each other pursuing our dreams.
Field research
To promote our project and seeking professional advice, we paid a visit to wastewater treatment plant at Hsinchu Science Park. During visitation, we learned more about how industry purify and recycle wastewater. After discussion with professionals, we improved our device so that it can be integrated into current industrial wasterwater treatment.
Questionnaire
We designed a questionnaire to survey public’s knowledge about PFCs. In the questionnaire we inserted multiple video clips and news introducing PFCs and synthetic biology.
Let the public be aware of the danger of PFCs and promote our project at the same time.
Provision
We applied USA provisional application for patent at this August. We want to use legal power to protect our patent right. In the future, we will try to file a corresponding nonprovisional application for patent.
