iGEM X Synthetic Biology exhibition
June 2016
We held an iGEM X synthetic biology exhibition in school library, drawing hundreds of visitors. We aimed to promote the concept of iGEM and synthetic biology to the common people by showing them some basic principles and practical application related to the synthetic biology.
We also made the elements of the biobrick (promoter, RBS, and etc) to let people learn how to complete the whole biobrick by assembling the elements themselves. We also provided the notebook to let people draw their own biobrick. And we got a lot of interesting “biobrick” from the people’s drawings. This was really cool exhibition experience!
Provisional
We applied USA provisional application for patent at August 9th. We want to use legal power to protect our patent right. Thanks to Professor Lai, we consulted Mr. Ge, the manager of Biobizlaw Inc and Patent and Trademark Office for professional advice. He taught us the concept of patent right. He was the one who gave us the idea about applying provision based on our project and financial  status. In the middle of writing process, we consulted Professor Cheng about how to write the legal document step by step. Thanks to their help, we finally finished our provision before we made public at Asia conference in National Cheng Kung University.
In the future, we will try to file a corresponding nonprovisional application for patent.
Sharing on Scientific American Taiwanese Edition
It’s our honor to be invited to share our experience about iGEM preparation and report fun projects in Giant Jamboree in one column at Scientific American Taiwanese Edition during Giant Jamboree and after we come back to Taiwan.
The article will be post on January 2017 edition. We will share our preparation experience, touching moments and innovative idea presented in Giant Jamboree.
