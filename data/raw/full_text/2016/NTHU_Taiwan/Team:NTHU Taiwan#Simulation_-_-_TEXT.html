For degradation of PFOA, we insert Fac-dex gene into plasmid backbone pSB1C3 for protein expression. We use a constitutive promoter to express Fac-dex gene.

For transportation of fluoride, we use another constitutive promoter to express a kind of fluoride transporter gene called CRCB. So that fluoride anion which is the predicted by product of PFCs degradation can be transported out of the bacteria.
