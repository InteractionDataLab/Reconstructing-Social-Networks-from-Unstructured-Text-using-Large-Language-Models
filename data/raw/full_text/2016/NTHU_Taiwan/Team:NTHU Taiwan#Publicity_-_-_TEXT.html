Publicity
Facebook fan page: NTHU_Taiwan IGEM team
2015~
At the beginning, we post the recruitment ad on Facebook welcoming freshman to join us. After that, we posted the latest news about igem and our team every week hoping to draw more attention to igem in our school.
Our questionnaire link is also posted on our fan page. Through sharing our questionnaire and finish it, many people know more about PFCs and danger of it The public are more aware about this hazardous environmental pollution.
Workshop
2015
During our recruitment in the begining, our web lab leader started workshop introducing basic concept about synthetic biology and the experiment technique that would be used in iGEM competition preparation.
Advocating iGEM in Hsinchuang senior high school in Taiwan
May 2016
Our team leader went to his high school to introduce the concept of iGEM, hoping to make more people know about iGEM and come to join this competition together!
iGEM X Synthetic Biology exhibition
June 2016
We held an iGEM X synthetic biology exhibition in school library, drawing hundreds of visitors. We aimed to promote the concept of iGEM and synthetic biology to the common people by showing them some basic principles and practical application related to the synthetic biology.
We also made the elements of the biobrick (promoter, RBS, and etc) to let people learn how to complete the whole biobrick by assembling the elements themselves. We also provided the notebook to let people draw their own biobrick. And we got a lot of interesting “biobrick” from the people’s drawings. This was really cool exhibition experience!
Communication with professor from National Taiwan Ocean University
July 2016
During summer, our PI invited professor Han-Jia Lin from National Taiwan Ocean University who has great interest in planning igem competition in future.
We shared our experience about how we started our team and run it during the past one and a half year.
Communication with HSiTAIWAN
September 2016
At September, team HSiTAIWAN and we had a small communication at their school. This year is second time for them to join iGEM.
We gained a lot of helpful advice about running a new igem team. We introduced project to the other, sharing the preparing experience during this summer.
Also, it's our pleasure to share our knowledge in synthetic biology to team HSiTaiwan. Meeting with motivated high school students was really pleasant and nice experience. Thanks for giving us chance to collaborate with them.
Sharing on Scientific American Taiwanese Edition
2016
It’s our honor to be invited to share our experience about iGEM preparation and report fun projects in Giant Jamboree in one column at Scientific American Taiwanese Edition during Giant Jamboree and after we come back to Taiwan.
The article will be post on January 2017 edition. We will share our preparation experience, touching moments and innovative idea presented in Giant Jamboree.
