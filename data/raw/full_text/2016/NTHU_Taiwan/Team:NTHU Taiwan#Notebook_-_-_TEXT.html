7/8
Successfully culture burkholderia acidpuldis
7/11
PCR for burkholderia acidpuldis (get fac-dex DNA sequence)
Primer: FDPXXBAF
Reverse primer: FDEXPSTR
98oC/98oC/57oC/72oC/72oC/12oC
30 sec/30 sec/30 sec/3.5 min/3.5 min/unlimited
For 30 cycles
-Order facdex DNA sequence from IDT
7/12
PCR clean up
Run gel => PCR result fail
Too many unexpected band
7/13
Learn how to ligation and transform
Try to fix PCR protocol
Add positive and negative control group
1. Only medium (negative control)
2. ddH2O (negative control)
3. another bacteria (positive control)
4. do PCR without taq polymerase (negative control)
