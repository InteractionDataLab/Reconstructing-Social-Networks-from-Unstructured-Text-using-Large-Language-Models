Visit wastewater treatment plant of Hsinchu Science Park
Sep 2016
To evaluate the feasibility of our device, we visited wastewater treatment plant at Hsinchu Science Park. We learned how the plant actually did to purify the wastewater and the common steps of wastewater treatment process in Taiwan.
We also discussed with the staff there about how we could integrate our device into current industrial wastewater treatment. We got some better ideas and showed the details on the device page of our wiki.
