Overview Publicity Conference Field Research Questionnaire Provision
Provision
We applied USA provisional application for patent at August 9th. We want to use legal power to protect our patent right. Thanks to Professor Lai, we consulted Mr. Ge, the manager of Biobizlaw Inc and Patent and Trademark Office for professional advice. He taught us the concept of patent right. He was the one who gave us the idea about applying provision based on our project and financial  status. In the middle of writing process, we consulted Professor Cheng about how to write the legal document step by step. Thanks to their help, we finally finished our provision before we made public at Asia conference in National Cheng Kung University.
In the future, we will try to file a corresponding nonprovisional application for patent.
