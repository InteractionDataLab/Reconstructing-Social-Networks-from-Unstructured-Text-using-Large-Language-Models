My name is Ta-wen Ho, the founder, entropy generator, and TA of NTHU_Taiwan iGEM team. I built up this team one and half years ago when I was a junior student in Department of Life Science, NTHU in 2014. Though we were not able to join the 2015 Giant Jamboree as NTHU_RadiationBuster Taiwan, with hard-working incubation, we finally found ample funding this year and registered as a formal team.
I am now a Ph.D. student in Neuroscience and Cognitive Science Program(NACS), University of Maryland and the cheerleader of the NTHU_Taiwan. Look forward to see you guys in Boston in October, 2016!
My name is Wu-Hsun Lai, the TA of modeling and simulation part of NTHU_Taiwan. I’m major in electrical engineering but have great interest in biological research.
I have join a team dealing with Parkinson's disease by integrated circuit with signal collection, detection and inhibition. I enjoy mathematical analysis, and I hope I can give members advices and solve modeling and simulation problems.
Hello, my name is LEE, CHIH-HSIEN. I’m from Interdisciplinary Program of Sciences in National Tsing Hua University.
In the school, I study chemistry and life science. I’m the team leader in NTHU_Taiwan, and majorly work in the dry lab.
I’m also study chemistry, and I am trying to make it more interesting. So, I often do some interesting experiments in my home, some of the experiments are really beautiful.
Besides participate igem competition and play chemistry, I also enjoy watching Japanese anime and playing YU-GI OH card trading card game. My favorite anime is CLANNAD and my favorite deck is LIGHTSWORN.
I can’t wait for make new friends during the giant competition!
Hey, my name is Yueh-Chen Chiang. I major in Interdisciplinary Program of Life Science in National Tsing Hua University. Life science is always my favorite. Both learning the knowledge of biology and conducting experiment are attractive for me.
Besides, I attempt everything I want. Studying law and foreign languages in school brings a lot of fun for me. I’m good at music and swimming, and chosen to be the vice-captain of school swimming team this year.
As the team member of a started iGEM team, I’m honored to be elected the leader of human practice and also doing parts of experiment. To prepare for iGEM competition, I combined knowledges of life science and law, which motivate me to learn more and more. The biggest gain for me is meeting new friends. Although we may be competitor or partner, all of us have the same dreams!
My name is WEI-CHIA HSU. I am major in medicine science in National Tsing Hua University(NTHU). I graduated from Chiayi high school. My dream is to become a biologist.
Last summer vacation, I joined the summer research project in Academia Sinica. The topic is about the relationship between Termitomyces sp. and Odontotermes formosanus.
Now, I join the lab in NTHU and do research in ultrasound-detected protein. I am wet lab leader. My mainly job is to solve the experimental problems and design the experiment process with my team members.
Hi, I’m Wei-En Huang. I’m in my junior year in NTHU. I double-major in Life Science and Chemistry. I am eager to know the mystery of how our life works. DNA, RNA, protein are the key to understand that. So I choose life science as my major.
Knowing more about chemistry definitely helps me to catch the points of biology much easier so I choose to double-major in chemistry. Using knowledge about biology and chemistry benefits a lot in experimental design and conducting experiments.
In iGEM competition, I am in charge of wet lab and doing parts of fund-raising. Through the preparation, I have learned a lot and experienced the excitements that exclusive for iGEMers. I can’t wait to see much more thrills and meet other iGEMers from all over the world in Giant Jamboree.
Hello, my name is CHANG CHE-KANG. I major in Interdisciplinary Program of Life Science in National Tsing Hua University. I am one of wet lab group members. My work in team is designing experiment and performing experiment.
I like bacteria. From the top of the mountain to the bottom of the ocean, the world is filled with these microorganisms. They are well adapted in almost every known environments. I am fascinated by them.
By the way, I enjoy reading light novels, watching anime, playing video game(especially Dark Soul series) in my free time.
My name is Li-Wen Chiu. I major in Life Science, minor in Anthropology in National Tsing Hua University(NTHU).
My dream is to become a Professor because I like teaching and doing experiments.
I joined the group last semester. At first, I was in the dry lab, but then I did more in wet lab. When I found problems, I give some suggestion to solve them.
Besides, I designed the questionnaire for letting more people know the harm of PFCs.
Although I did not participate in brainstorming before the decision of the project, I tried hard to do something good for the team.
My name is Chih-Mei, Young. I’m a junior majoring in Chemical Engineering. Although I had minimal biology experience, I am eager to acquire cutting-edge knowledge in synthetic biology and any other biology-related discipline.
In addition, I’m interesting in the combination of engineering with bio-technology and their applications.
From IGEM, I hope to gain wet lab experience and learn to cooperate with members from different departments. I would like to dedicate all I’ve learned to our project and I’m always ready for taking on challenges.
On top of IGEM and schoolwork, I also enjoy some activities such as playing badminton, playing piano and traveling.
Hello everyone, my name is LI, JIAN-BAI. I’m from Interdisciplinary Program of Life Science in National Tsing Hua University.
In the school, I majored in Life Science and minored in Computer Science. Coding in C language and studying life science interest me. In this iGEM program, I am glad to have chance to apply what I have learned in computer science class.
Drawing, dancing, and cooking are my hobbies. I hope I can use my ability of drawing to make our iGEM wiki more beautiful.
Besides, I can learn the skill of simulating experiment with a wide variety of software. After this one year training, I think I have confidence in facing anything bravely in the future.
Hey, my name is LIN, CHIH-CHEN.
I am a senior student in National Tsing-Hua University, majoring in Engineering and System Science.
In the NTHU_Taiwan iGEM team, I work in dry lab. My hobbies are playing volleyball, singing, and reading.
Before I participated in this team, I had held some activities, such as a camp for children. It was a special experience and I had beautiful memories.
Now, I’m happy to gain knowledge about synthetic biology and skills about modeling.
I also hope to use my abilities of CFD to enrich our results. I believe that it will be very interesting and challenging in 2016, and I am looking forward to make new friends in Giant Jamboree!
Hello, my name is Yu-Lin Lu, and I’m from Department of Life Science in National Tsing-Hua University. My major work in this team is simulation and designing wiki. I join the iGEM team for learning more methods about designing experiment, data analysis, and simulation. I also want to communicate with other people for learning more ideas.
The DNA sequence gives me a bytecode-like feeling so I want to try to find a way to explain the sequence like Java bytecode instruction, and then try to make a sequence able to design like computer programming. I hope what I get in this one year can help me to achieve my goal.
Hello, I’m GUAN MIAO, LIN. I’m studying life science and quantitative finance in National Tsing Hua University in Taiwan now.
