Questionnaire
Background about PFCs
In this part, we want to know public’s understanding about PFCs.
Question 1: Have you ever heard of Perfluorinated compounds (PFCs)?
Question 2: Which aspect(s) of PFCs are you familiar with? (multiple-choice)
Question 3: Which description most fits your knowledge about the harm of PFCs?(mutiple choice)
In the first question, we found that 36% people have heard of PFCs, 38% people may heard, and 23% people did not heard of it. In the second question, 45% people thought PFCs may effect on human while 45% people were not familiar with it.
Because bioaccumulation has the greatest harm on human and other organisms, we described it in the answer of the third question. It will pollute the environment because it will not easily decompose in nature but accumulate easily in living organism. It showed that 53% people agreed with this description. According to the data collected, only 36% people confirmed they have heard of it in the first question, and the next answer from second question shows 45% people more than 36% think it may effect on human.
Finally, 53% people over half percentage think it is harmful to people. Through our questionnaire, people can know more about PFCs after they finished this part.
Delivering the problem which we are trying to solve
We want to let people know more about PFC’s  harm to human, and understand our project.
Therefore, we search four videos to deliver the information.
Question 4: Do you want to know more about PFCs through video? If so, which one?

Question 5: Do you understand more about PFCs after you watched the video?
Totally, 85% people understood more about PFCs after finishing the questionnaire.
Personal Information
The population of males who filled the questionnaire is more than females. But the male to female ratio in our team is one to one. It seems that the difference with the gender still exist. More males filled the scientific questionnaire.
Most people chose the Bachelor’s degree from the education level. 17% people studied in the Senior high school filled our questionnaire.
The age range is from 11~60. People from 11~20 answering our questionnaire took the major part.

Understanding people’s life experiences
Everyone may be our customers. We want to know which part they may concern most. For this purpose, we designed the question and found the most is carcinogen.
Question 7: Which of the following frightens you the most?
Question 8: Below are some products that use PFCs as their raw material. Which product(s) do you usually use?
Unexpectedly, the result shows that 66% people thought PFCs could be found in Waster water. It supports our device which is designed for waste water from the factory.
Conclusion
There were two main topics that were addressed in the Knowledge Sharing questionnaire:
1. Let more people knew the Perfluorinated compounds, and promotes the consciousness considered harmful PFCs.
2. Let us know which parts of PFCs people concern more, and put it into our product packaging.
Although we achieved our goal: let more people know more about PFCs, we did not tell our project to them. Therefore, We let people optionally leave their email to send our wiki link. However, we did not collect enough information. At the beginning, we hope we can find 1000 people, but finally just 300 people filled in. How to deliver the questionnaire through more people is what we have to think about.
