Main part:
Part BBa_K2073008:
Part BBa_K2073009:
Both Fac-dex1 and Fac-dex3 are fluoroacetate dehalogenases. The enzyme can break down the carbonfluorine bond from PFOA/PFOS.
In this part we use IPTG promoter BBa_K2073009 to control the protein expression of Fac-dex.
Part BBa_K2073010, BBa_K2073011, BBa_K2073012, BBa_K2073013:
Fluoride has dramatic effects on most of bacteria. Bacteria would fend off fluoride, which is organisms treat as toxic substance, by throwing it out. Ion transporters is the common used method.
BBa_K2073010~ BBa_K2073013 can express different fluoride transporters(CrcB family) in E.coli. CrcB can be transported to plasma membrane and expulse fluoride ion from bacteria . Avoid bacteria die due to fluoride.
Test part:
Part BBa_J04430:
We use fluorescence microscope to measure GFP fluorescence. In this part we want to know how bacteria look like when it express GFP.
Part BBa_K2073007:
In this part we use intensity of GFP to measure the protein expression of Fac-dex3. If the engineered bacteria shows GFP fluorescence, we will know that the Fac-dex3 is successfully expressed by bacteria.
