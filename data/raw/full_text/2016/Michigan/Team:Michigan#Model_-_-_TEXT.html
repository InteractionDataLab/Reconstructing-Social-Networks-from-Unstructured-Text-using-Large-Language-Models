To optimize the conditions of our proximity dependent ligation reaction, we used a system of equations to find the concentrations of all relevant molecules and complexes at equilibrium. This allowed us to predict how changing the concentrations and characteristics of the various oligonucleotides involved would affect the rate of the proximity dependent ligation reaction with or without the target biomarker present. This is an important aspect of our design, because the difference in the rate of the ligation reaction with or without target protein is what drives detection and prevents false-positives. See modeling page for more info.
