Team Michigan 2016 Project Description
      This year Team Michigan is working towards the goal of creating a cheap, portable, paper-based diagnostic test for protein biomarkers. Our design is intended to make such tests affordable for patients in resource scarce settings and developing countries. We believe our design is particularly promising for the detection of infectious diseases such as tuberculosis.
      Our project utilizes aptamer-based proximity-dependent ligation, NASBA, and in vitro transcription and translation to produce an enzymatic reporter protein which provides a colorimetric output. This output will be visible to the naked eye, signaling the presence of a protein biomarker. We hope this system, which can be performed outside the lab with minimal training,  will provide a lower cost alternative to western blotting and ELISA.
