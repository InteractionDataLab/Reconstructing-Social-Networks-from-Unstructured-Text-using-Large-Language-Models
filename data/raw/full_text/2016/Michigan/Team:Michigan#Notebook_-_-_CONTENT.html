Cutting plasmids with Not1 should yield a 3 kb fragment and a 5.3 kb fragment. If it only yields a 5 kb fragment then the insertion was not successful. Using two different tubes of NotI at the same time in case one is bad.

Protocol:
For each tube of DNA:
     -1 uL NotI HF tube 1
     -1 uL NotI HF tube 2
     -4 uL DNA
     -1 uL cutsmart buffer
     -3 uL H2O

Incubate at 37C for 1 hour (started 10:12 pm, ended at ~11:30) then run on 1% agarose gel.
*The 1:9 digests actually just got 2uL of NotI from tube 1 because tube 2 ran out.

Did PCR of lacZ plasmid and ran it on a gel (analytical gel not preparative) and uploaded image to drive. Still need to do a PCR cleanup of the PCR product. Pet28a plasmid is in Liu lab. Need to bring some of it to the USB. Took ligation product from 9/7 and digested with SalI then transformed. This gave 2 colonies which were cultured and minipreped. Some of these plasmids was then digested with NotI (which should yield a 5.3 kb frag and 3 kb frag), but this gave only one band which was ~7-10 kb. This might mean that the ligation worked but the NotI digest didn’t? We should digest these with HindIII and EcoRI (which should yield a 3 kb fragment and a 5.3 kb fragment if ligation worked).
</P></DIV><DIV class="maize"><H2>October</H2><P style="font-size: 20px"> -Cannot find lacZ deletion r or lacZ deletion f in the USB or Liu lab after looking extensively. Reordering but need to come up with an alternative method of showing that part of our project works.
</P><P style="font-size: 20px"> -Ideas: Do PLA and NASBA then digest with DNase I and run agarose gel with SYBR gold. Protein gel to detect alpha fragment. Could be improved if we had dna coding for alpha frag. Possibly even just detecting PLA directly on a gel if it is sensitive enough? It looks like as little as 16.7 nM of probe 1 linked to probe 2 (short terminator) would be detectable on an agarose gel with sybr gold (40 ng in a 20 ul reaction). The M.W. of probe 1 linked to probe 2 (short terminator) is 95652 g/mol, M.W. of probe 2 (short terminator) is 45123, M.W. of probe 1 is 50467, M.W. of 3C connector is 5742, M.W. of 2C connector is 5453, M.W. of 1C connector is 5163...   For testing PLA using agarose gel and sybr gold only… We want to shoot for ~200 ng of probe 1 linked to probe 2 (short terminator) product for maximum visibility on the gel. We want an equimolar amount of thrombin, probe 1, probe 2, and the connector. They should all be 0.1 uM final conc.
We want 74.03 ng of human alpha thrombin because M.W. of thrombin is 37000 daltons. Our thrombin stock is 7.9 mg/ml so we need to dilute a small part of this stock (diluted in 1X T4 DNA ligase buffer) by a factor of 100 so that we can use 0.937 uL of that diluted stock in a 20 ul reaction.
In this reaction, we will also need 100.95 ng of probe 1 and 90.24 ng of probe 2 and 11.48 ng 3C connector or 10.91 ng of 2C connector or 10.33 ng of 1C connector. We will also want 2 ul of T4 DNA ligase and 2 ul of T4 DNA ligase buffer per rxn. Incubate at 37C for ? minutes. Heat samples to 70C for 10 min to heat inactivate ligase and melt connector-probe interactions, then immediately load onto 1.75% agarose gel. Run a ladder and also run 100.95 ng probe 1 alone.</P><P style="font-size: 20px"> - <B>6/14/16:</B> Diluting all oligos to 100 uM stocks except for connectors which are 200 uM...
