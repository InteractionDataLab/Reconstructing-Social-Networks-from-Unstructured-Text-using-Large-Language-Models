ProtoCat 3.0 - Team/Attributions
I'm Josh Abramson, one of the team's co-founders and the current social chair. Hailing from West Bloomfield, I've made a living studying Biology, Mathematics, and Chemical Physics at the University of Michigan. Before leading the software team, I was on the Michigan lab team for 4 years as a member and 1 year as an advisor. Outside of iGEM, I enjoy tree climbing, playing pranks on my professors, and computer games.

Hello, I'm Ali Turfah. I'm a junior studying Data and Computer Science, and am the current president of the Michigan Software 2016 team. In my free time I like to program, read, and during longer breaks I design and build costumes. I have a cat, so I thoroughly enjoy the branding of our project as well as the ProtoCat mascot.
