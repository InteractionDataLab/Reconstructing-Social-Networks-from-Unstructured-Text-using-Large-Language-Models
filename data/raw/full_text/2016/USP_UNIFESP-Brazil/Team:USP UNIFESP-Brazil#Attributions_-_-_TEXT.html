Primary Principal Investigator (Primary PI) - Professor João   Carlos Monteiro de Carvalho, Ph.D. Our team really appreciate Professor   João’s contribution to the team with his expertise about algae cultivation. He also,   in a position of authority, assisted with official aspects in the University. We   thank him for believing in us and providing laboratory space, some reagents and   equipment.
Secondary Principal Investigator (Secondary PI) - Livia Seno   Ferreira Camargo, Ph.D. Our team would like to thank Livia who contributed   with her expertise in algae molecular biology and cultivation. She provided great   help with team registration, fund raising, giving support throughout the season and   helping on the contact with IGEM for updates, and companies for laboratory supplies   and donations.
Instructor - João Vitor Dutra Molino. Our team   would like to say thank you to João, who contributed with his expertise in algae   molecular biology, cultivation and protein purification. He motivated the team by   planning experiments, gathering team members and giving a day to day support. He   also worked hard on tasks as lab duties, fund raising, laboratory training and   hardware development together.
Instructor - Thiago Mosqueiro, Ph.D. We would like   to thank Thiago who contributed with his expertise in data analysis and scientific   programming by helping in the analysis of the screening experiment. He also helped   us write pieces of code to analyse our fluorescence data.
Sponsors
USP_UNIFESP-BRAZIL team would like to sincerely thank our sponsors for their   support, for making our registration (Merck KGaA), donating reagents (Merck KGaA and   Thermo Fischer Scientific), and financing some of the travels to the main event   Giant Jamboree (Pro-rectories from University of São Paulo). We also would like to   thank everyone who donated to our crowdfunding campaigns.
Special Thanks
USP_UNIFESP-BRAZIL team really appreciate the support given by   Professors, who allowed us to use their laboratory space, reagents and equipment,   and by their knowledge contribution; Company's employees, who were reached easily   and gave their best to make the donation process faster, and Institutions and   Companies that helped us by publishing our ideas and project.

Press
What if we could spread our project idea in media and press?
That was one of the first questions that our team asked, and the   answer was: yes! The first report was launched by the brazilian website TechMundo   (World Technology) in May 2016 and named “Algaranha: Brazilian create webs   from algae to heal burns”. The report highlighted the project objectives and   explained the iGEM competition.
The paper “Chimeric spider silk production in microalgae: a   modular bionanomaterial” was released on June 23rd 2016 by the innovative,   open access journal RIO (Research Ideas and Outcomes). This paper explains the   project idea, emphasizing the possibility of exploring the modular characteristic of   spider silk proteins and describes the methods to achieve it.
The report entitled “Ready to Compete” was publicly   released in September 2016 by ‘Pesquisa FAPESP’, a magazine published by   São Paulo Research Foundation with a current circulation of 44,000. The   report describes the iGEM competition, our project and the lack of funds that was   faced by our team. It was also discussed the devices created and made by our team,   as the microcentrifuge, made from MDF panel, and a DNA electrophoresis buffer tank,   made of acrylic. This report was published in print edition and online, shared in   academia through a workshop, reaching brazilian researchers and students from the   Univesity.
All these press coverage have significantly contributed to the   crowdfunding (you can read more in the crowdfunding link) and increased group   visibility. The reports were also shared in our social media, and the received   positive comments encouraged us to keep our focus on the project and face the   obstacles.

Crowdfunding
During the project development our team launched two crowdfunding   campaigns to obtain financial support through the following platforms: Vakinha and   Dodo Funding. The first is a national platform and the aim of this campaign was to   receive financing by reaching out friends, family, companies, universities and   people interested in science in Brazil. In order to attract investors we provided   gifts according to the donated amount of money, which included stickers for credit   card, bags, shirts, glasses case, a kit to build a microscope and the game of genes   (developed by the team USP- Brazil in 2013). As a result, we have raised R$ 7,471.00   (U$S 2,134.00). The raised money was lower than expected, but it helped to finance   lab costs and some traveling expenses of some group members to the Giant Jamboree.!
The Dodo Funding campaign aimed the international community and   resulted in U$S 144.69.This money was very helpful for the registrationfand banner   payments, which allowed us to participate in Fablearn Brazil 2016, a brazilian   conference about digital manufacturing (you can read more about this project at   human practices Gold   Criteria ).
During the campaign, we faced some challenges, as difficulty to   promote the project and short deadline to raise funds. In order to overcome these   issues, we sent many e-mails to companies, science websites, journalists, brazilian   newspapers and tried to disseminate the campaign to the largest number of people as   possible. These tasks enabled us to create strategies to prepare campaign material,   and to understand the opportunities and responsibilities that are involved in the   project marketing. Even if we did not get the money to fund the trip for all group   members, we consider crowdfunding an excellent way to generate funds to iGEM   project.
As we countdown the days to the Giant Jamboree, we would like to   thank all the people that have contributed to the project, supported it and believed   in us. We are very grateful to everyone. In return, we expect to bring some   knowledge about synthetic biology with our project and also contribute to the   brazilian science. Here follows the name of the ones that supported us:
