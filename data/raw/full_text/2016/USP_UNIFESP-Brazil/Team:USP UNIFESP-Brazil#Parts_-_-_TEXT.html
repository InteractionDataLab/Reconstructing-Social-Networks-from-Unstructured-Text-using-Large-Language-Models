Basic Parts
Our major contribution of a Basic Part for the iGEM community is a BioBrick coding for the catalytic protein domain of lysostaphin ( BBa_K2136002 ) optimized for Chlamydomonas reinhardtii genome. This is an antibiotic peptide domain which can be used by future teams in the development of projects fighting antibiotic resistant Staphylococcus or working with its population dynamics.
Composite Parts
Our favourite composite part was the 5' cassete for Chlamydomonas transgenic expression ( BBa_K2136010 ). We validated it through a series of measurements which show the production and secretion of mCherry protein by Chlamydomonas. A detailed descriptions is available in our Proof of concept page.
