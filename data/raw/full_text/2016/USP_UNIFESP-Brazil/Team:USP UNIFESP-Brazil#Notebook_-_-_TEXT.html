Notebook
The lab notebook is the window to our soul. Here we describe all those weeks of experiments, with proper attributions to the wetlab iGEMers! We have separated it in two parts. A (more) organized notebook with the experiments curated by topic and the full lab notebook, with everything we documented from the wet lab!
Full notebook
Here you can find our full notebook, with troubleshooting, annotations, preparation of reagents, optimization of processes and, of course, experiments. If you are brave enough, you can download right below or (depending on your browser) read the text online! You can also find a compilation of all the protocols we used right here!
TIP: Use the PDF bookmarks to navigate among different weeks of experiments!

Divided notebook
If you get lost by browsing through our complete notebook (we get lost too!), we are providing our divided version by research fronts that were addressed in our project!
