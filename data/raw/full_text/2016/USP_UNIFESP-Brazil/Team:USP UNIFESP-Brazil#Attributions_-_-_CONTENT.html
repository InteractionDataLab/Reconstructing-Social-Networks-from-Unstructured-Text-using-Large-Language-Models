</STRONG></P><P class="black">That was one of the first questions that our team asked, and the 

answer was: yes! The first report was launched by the brazilian website TechMundo 

(World Technology) in May 2016 and named “Algaranha: Brazilian create webs 

from algae to heal burns”. The report highlighted the project objectives and 

explained the iGEM competition.</P><P class="black">The paper “Chimeric spider silk production in microalgae: a 

modular bionanomaterial” was released on June 23rd 2016 by the innovative, 

open access journal RIO (Research Ideas and Outcomes). This paper explains the 

project idea, emphasizing the possibility of exploring the modular characteristic of 

spider silk proteins and describes the methods to achieve it.</P><P class="black">The report entitled “Ready to Compete” was publicly 

released in September 2016 by ‘Pesquisa FAPESP’, a magazine published by 

São Paulo Research Foundation with a current circulation of 44,000. The 

report describes the iGEM competition, our project and the lack of funds that was 

faced by our team. It was also discussed the devices created and made by our team, 

as the microcentrifuge, made from MDF panel, and a DNA electrophoresis buffer tank, 

made of acrylic. This report was published in print edition and online, shared in 

academia through a workshop, reaching brazilian researchers and students from the 

Univesity.</P><P class="black">All these press coverage have significantly contributed to the 

crowdfunding (you can read more in the crowdfunding link) and increased group 

visibility. The reports were also shared in our social media, and the received 

positive comments encouraged us to keep our focus on the project and face the 

obstacles.</P><P class="black"><STRONG>References:</STRONG></P><P class="black">Chimeric spider silk production in microalgae: a modular

Crowdfunding
</H2></DIV></DIV><DIV class="small-10 columns small-offset-2"><DIV class="small-10 small-offset-1 columns"><P class="black">During the project development our team launched two crowdfunding 

campaigns to obtain financial support through the following platforms: Vakinha and 

Dodo Funding. The first is a national platform and the aim of this campaign was to 

receive financing by reaching out friends, family, companies, universities and 

people interested in science in Brazil. In order to attract investors we provided 

gifts according to the donated amount of money, which included stickers for credit 

card, bags, shirts, glasses case, a kit to build a microscope and the game of genes 

(developed by the team USP- Brazil in 2013). As a result, we have raised R$ 7,471.00 

(U$S 2,134.00). The raised money was lower than expected, but it helped to finance 

lab costs and some traveling expenses of some group members to the Giant Jamboree.! 

</P><P class="black">The Dodo Funding campaign aimed the international community and 

resulted in U$S 144.69.This money was very helpful for the registrationfand banner 

payments, which allowed us to participate in Fablearn Brazil 2016, a brazilian 

conference about digital manufacturing (you can read more about this project at 

human practices <A href="https://2016.igem.org/Team:USP_UNIFESP-Brazil/HP/Gold"> Gold 

Criteria</A>).</P><P class="black"> During the campaign, we faced some challenges, as difficulty to 

promote the project and short deadline to raise funds. In order to overcome these 

issues, we sent many e-mails to companies, science websites, journalists, brazilian 

newspapers and tried to disseminate the campaign to the largest number of people as 

possible. These tasks enabled us to create strategies to prepare campaign material, 

and to understand the opportunities and responsibilities that are involved in the 

project marketing. Even if we did not get the money to fund the trip for all group 

members, we consider crowdfunding an excellent way to generate funds to iGEM 

project. </P><P class="black"> As we countdown the days to the Giant Jamboree, we would like to 

thank all the people that have contributed to the project, supported it and believed 

in us. We are very grateful to everyone. In return, we expect to bring some 

knowledge about synthetic biology with our project and also contribute to the 

brazilian science. Here follows the name of the ones that supported us: </P><DIV>Raquel de Souza LimaSara de Souza LimaGisele MonteiroGilberto
