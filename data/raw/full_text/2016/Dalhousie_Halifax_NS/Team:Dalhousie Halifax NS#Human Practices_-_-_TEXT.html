What we did
This year we tried to have a few different focuses for our Human Practices, including an integrated project. We did some public outreach and engagement through community presentations at the SuperNOVA summer camps and a departmental seminar presentation with the Department of Microbiology and Immunology at Dalhousie Univeristy. We also reached out to the Advanced Education Minister of Nova Scotia in an effort to make iGEM a more sustainable effort for Atlantic Canadian University. We also built a Microbiome Map of Shubenacadie Wildlife Park , which took sequencing results from our project and incorporated them into an interactive tool to learn a bit more about microbiomes.
