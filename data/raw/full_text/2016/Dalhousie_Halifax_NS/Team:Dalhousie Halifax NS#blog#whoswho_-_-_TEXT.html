Who's Who?
Many weeks ago, the team went to Schubenacadie Wildlife Park where we collected not only fecal samples from porcupines but also from other mammals found at the Park. As described in previous blog posts, the fecal samples were then plated onto cellulose media and incubated in either aerobic or anaerobic conditions. Since that initial plating, I have resuspended the colonies in 1xPBS, carried out a serial dilution to attempt to isolate single colonies, and then plated onto new cellulose media. After 24 hours, single colonies were noticeable at the more dilute concentrations and there were quite a few different morphologies!
From the aerobic and anaerobic cellulose plates, three colony morphologies were selected and streaked onto normal LB. The aerobic cellulose plate (pictured here on the right) had at least three different morphologies: a white colony, a yellow colony, and a white with red centre colony. The anaerobic cellulose plate contained all white colonies although there were size differences. After 24 hours, the LB plates were observed and only individual colonies appeared on the anaerobic plates. The aerobic plates were given another 24 hours to continue growing. Therefore after 48 hours I observed the anaerobic and aerobic LB plates. The three anaerobic plates all had white colonies with varying sizes. Two of the aerobic plates also had white colonies but one plate (originally the white colony on the cellulose media) actually had a brown colour. BrownBacteriaonLBMy intention with these plates was to isolate single colonies so I could preform a colony PCR and send the samples off for 16s rRNA sequencing, but I thought in the meantime while I await the results, I might as well try out some old school detective work. Therefore I carried out a gram stain on each of the six plates and it appeared that the six bacteria that were isolated all were gram-negative. Knowing that MacConkey Agar is selective for gram negative, I decided to plate the bacteria onto MacConkey to see if any could ferment lactose. The bacteria are now entering their second day of growth on the MacConkey media and so I will update the blog when I have results!
