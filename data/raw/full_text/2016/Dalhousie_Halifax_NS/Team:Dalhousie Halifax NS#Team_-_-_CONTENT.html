I originally began university thinking that eukaryotic cells were the most fascinating things out there, and not to anger anyone who agrees with that statement, but I am now a prokaryote fan after learning about the many marvelous abilities and complexities of these curious cells. I hope to pursue a career as a clinical microbiologist and I am particularly fascinated in exploring antibiotic resistance.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="row" id="namelandon" style="text-align: center; color:#0D6A8B;"><H2> Landon Getz </H2><P style="color:black; text-align: center;font-family:lato-thin;font-size:20pt;">Microbiology and Immunology</P></DIV><DIV class="row" id="landonandmack"><DIV class="col-md-8" id="landontext" style="align-content: left;"><P>My name is Landon Getz.

Having watched the iGEM team last year, and taking a few classes in synthetic biology, I decided I wanted to try my own hand at it. So here I am. My task with our iGEM team this year, with the help of Mackenzie Thornbury, is to sequence some 16S rRNA genes and discover what microbes are found in the gut of the porcupine. I am also the main web designer for this years team. I am looking forward to continuing our porcupine research and hopefully finding some interesting microorganisms in the process!</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="row" id="namemack" style="text-align: center; color:#8B1015;"><H2> Mackenzie Thornbury </H2><P style="color:black; text-align: center;font-family:lato-thin;font-size:20pt;">Microbiology and Immunology</P></DIV><DIV class="row" id="mack"><DIV class="col-md-8" id="macktext"><P> My name is Mackenzie Thornbury and I am a fourth year Microbiology and Immunology student at Dalhousie University.

Since then the topic has continuously peaked my interest particularly through recent progressive studies in CRISPR. As a chemist my main interests lies around the applications of synthetic biology in the field of chemistry, such as the use of enzymes to overcome challenging metabolic pathways or introducing new reaction mechanisms to produce complex molecules. I am excited to be part of the iGEM team this year!</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="row" id="namemostafa" style="text-align: center; color:#8B1015;"><H2> Mostafa Hagar </H2><P style="color:black; text-align: center;font-family:lato-thin;font-size:20pt;">Chemistry and Neuroscience</P></DIV><DIV class="row" id="mostafa"><DIV class="col-md-8" id="mostafatext"><P>My name is Mostafa Hagar and I'm finishing up fourth year at Dalhousie University, double majoring in chemistry and neuroscience. A really good friend of mine (Paul) participated in iGEM last year and recommended I look into it. I first got interested in synthetic biology after reading a few chemistry papers where organic chemists used enzymes to synthesize their targets. I think it's really cool that we can use enzymes to do the same transformations that chemists go through a lot of effort to achieve, and I'm really excited to get more exposure to that kind of biology and understand how people work with these enzymes.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="row" id="namenicholas" style="text-align: center; color:#AA8D55;"><H2> Nicholas Boudreau </H2><P style="color:black; text-align: center;font-family:lato-thin;font-size:20pt;">Microbiology and Immunology</P></DIV><DIV class="row" id="Nicholas"><DIV class="col-md-8" id="Nicholastext"><P>My name is Nicholas Boudreau.

In both of these positions I learned cell and molecular biology techniques that I use to further my research on regulation of development in yeast. Synthetic biology is fascinating to me in that it has led researchers to discover systems that we didn't know existed in bacterial cells and use them in interesting ways to ask important questions in other cell types. Working with the iGEM team is of interest to me because I like to be involved in guiding students as they pursue their research into areas of gene regulation. I am so amazed and impressed by our iGEM group members as each student brings an interesting set of skills and perspectives to thinking about this project. Team work and communication are the core to generating new ideas!</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="row" id="namejamie" style="text-align:center; color:#032B5E;"><H2> Jamie Cook </H2><P style="color:black; text-align: center;font-family:lato-thin;font-size:20pt;">Graduate Advisor</P></DIV><DIV class="row" id="jamie"><DIV class="col-md-8" id="jamie-text"><P>My name is Jamie Cook and I am one of Dalhousie’s iGEM team mentors.

I just recently graduated from the University of New Brunswick in Fredericton with an honours degree in biology, concentrations in microbiology and molecular biology, and a minor Psychology. I am very interested in synthetic biology because I believe it is a greener method to produce chemicals compared to previous methods, which generated harmful by-products. I also find it fascinating how we can use bacteria such as E. coli, and use them as mini factories to generate desired chemicals.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="row" id="emilyname" style="text-align:center;"><H2 style="color:#D1B685;"> Emily Lamoureux </H2><P style="text-align: center;font-family:lato-thin;font-size:20pt;"> Graduate Advisor </P></DIV><DIV class="row" id="emily"><DIV class="col-md-8" id="emilytext" style="padding-top:30px;"><P>My name is Emily Lamoureux and I am finishing up the first year of my Masters in Pharmacology.
