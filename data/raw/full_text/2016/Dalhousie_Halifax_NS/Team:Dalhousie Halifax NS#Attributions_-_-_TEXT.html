Who did what?
General Support:
Dr. Zhenyu Cheng, Dr. Lois Murray, and Dr. John Rohde helped the team throughout the entire course of the project from the initial process of brainstorming our experiments to the final stage of guiding our presentation of Results. Furthermore, Dr. Cheng and Dr. Rohde provided their labs for the majority of the bacterial experiments, and Dr. Murray provided various reagents and enzymes.
Patrick Slaine was crucial during the cloning of our Biobrick. He worked with the team to ensure our understanding of how to clone, and how to design primers.
Jamie Cook never failed to provide insight on experimental techniques and problem solving strategies in lab meetings and during experiments.
Emily Lamoureux was our insight into sequencing. She guided our understanding of the sequencing process and helped us interpret our results.
Renee Raudonis collected resin samples.
Sequencing Support:
Dr. Morgan Langille, Dr. Andr√© Comeau, and the Integrated Microbiome Research group not only sequenced all of our fecal samples, but were always ready to answer our questions about their sequencing analysis software.
Fecal Samples Support:
Schubenacadie Wildlife Park was always willing to provide the team with fecal samples not only from the porcupines but from 20 other mammals as well.
Cosmid and Protocol Support:
Dr. Trevor Charles, and Dr. Jiujun Cheng (Waterloo University) provided the pJC8 cosmid and the metagenomic library protocol to be used in the construction of our own metagenomic library.
Human Practices Support:
SuperNOVA at Dalhousie invited us to present to two different groups at their Summer Camps.  Joachim Stroink, the MLA for Halifax Chebucto, got us in contact with the Minister of Advanced Education and Labour.
The Department of Microbiology and Immunology at Dalhousie University invited us to present our project at the weekly Departmental Seminar.
