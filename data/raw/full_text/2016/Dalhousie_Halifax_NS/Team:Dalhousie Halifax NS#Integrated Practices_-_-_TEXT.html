Shubenacadie Microbiome Map
The Map
Our team was only able to obtain our samples due to our partnership with Shubenacadie wildlife park. Because of this, we have decided to how our appreciation by creating an interactive map detailing the animals’ microbiomes by geographical location at the park. To a general audience, the microbiome can be a very abstract concept since bacteria are rarely viewed as part of an internal ecosystem. This map is intended to make bacteria more tangible by letting people compare animals, their diets and their microbiomes. To use the map, hover over an animal habitat for a cursory look at their microbiome. For a more in-depth look and a brief description of the animal’s diet, click on the habitat.
To Use The Microbiome Map:
Hover your mouse over the diamond shapes to find out what animal lives at that location in the Shubenacadie Wildlife Park. A popup list will appear and provide you with the Genus of interesting bacterial species, if their microbiome has been sequenced by us.
Click on that habitat to get a more in-depth look at the animal, as well as some more microbiome information!
