Vector Assembly
Our vector had to be assembled from the scratch. We started with gBlock from IDT. Those gBlocks already had the BioBrick pre- and suffix included. As vector backbone the pUC19 plasmid was used. Before doing the assembly we had to make sure we have the correct sequence. We carried out a blunt-end ligation of every gBlock to a commercial pJET 2.1 vector for sequencing. After sequencing we picked the appropriate clones to do PCR reactions in order to get the correct fragment from the pJET vector. After cleaning the PCR products we digested the pUC19 with EcoRI and PstI. The first insert was cut with EcoRI and SpeI, the second insert with XbaI and PstI. Afterwards the ligation of Insert1 (toxin_dammet), Insert2 (colour_antitoxin) and Vector was done.
Characterisation
After the assembly we transformed our plasmid to E.coli XL1 and plated them on LB agar plates. The first few attempts showed really bad growth, so we started to add glucose to the LB plates at a concentration of 25mmol/l in order to have the tac promoter repressed.
The colonies we got were used for an Over Night Culture (ONC). To see if E.coli has the correct plasmid we performed a plasmid preparation and used EcoRI for restriction analysis. The next step was sequencing to see if the plasmid was all correct or if there happened any mutations during the growth phase that led to a non-functional toxin.  After we got our sequencing results confirmed we scaled up the ONC to 500ml and started induction at OD600 0.6 to see if the protein was expressed or not. We used SDS-PAGE to compare induced against non-induced protein and to figure out if our proteins are soluble or non-soluble, we compared the supernatant against the cell lysis. Because SDS-Page gives no real proof if it was exactly our protein we did mass spectrometry.
Microbial Part
For the final task we had to force our E.colis to combate each other, in different ways. The first method is using LB plates with 0.1mmol IPTG for induction. We pre mixed colonies from red and blue in a reaction tube and plated them. The second method was done by using an inoculation loop and striking the different strains above each other. This time we let them grow first and used 100µl of 0.1mmol IPTG to induce the cells afterwards. A third idea was to let both strands grow in liquid LB medium overnight and plate them the next day. After one more day the number of surviving red and blue colonies can be counted.

Autoclave at 121°C for 20 min
Plasmid preparation
Day before: Pre-culture in LB-medium containing the appropriate antibiotics. The amount of liquid    cell culture required for plasmid preparation depends on the copy number of the plasmid (between 5 and 20 mL)

Carefully remove the supernatant
Resuspend pellet in 250μL resuspension solution
Add 250 μL lysis solution and invert the tube gently 5 to 6 times
Lysis should not exceed 5 min
Add 350 μL neutralization solution and invert the tube 5 to 6 times
Centrifuge the suspension for 5min at max. speed
Prepare the columns
Transfer the supernatant without the white stuff of the centrifuged samples onto columns
