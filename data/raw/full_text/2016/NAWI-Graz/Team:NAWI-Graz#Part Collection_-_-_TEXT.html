Composite parts sent to the registry
BBa_K2142000
This part was used to make our E.coli resistant against the mazF toxin they should produce. For this reason the expressed the mazE antitoxin (BBa_K2142001). Further we used Anderson promoters and RBS to be sure our proteins are expressed constitutive. This was very important for the reason the Antitoxin has a really short half-life and the chromoprotein was used to detect the winner. At the end of the part we used a bidirectional double terminator, which also terminated the transcription of BBa_K2142005.
BBa_K2142005
In our project we used this composite part to let our E.coli attack with the mazF toxin (BBa_K2142003). Further this part contains a Dam methylase (BBa_K2142004) for the reason this protein leads due to over expression to an increased mutation rate. For the reason toxin production and mutation can cause problems during assembling and testing the expression of the proteins can be induced with IPTG. This part belongs to BBa_K2142000.
BBa_K2142007
This part was used to make our E.coli resistant against the ccdB toxin they should produce. For this reason they expressed the (BBa_K2142006). Further we used Anderson promoters and RBS to be sure our proteins are expressed constitutive. This was very important for the reason the Antitoxin has a real short half-life and the chromoprotein was used to detect the winner. At the end of the part we used a bidirectional double terminator, which also terminated the transcription of BBa_K2142005.
BioBricks/Basic Parts
BBa_K2142001
This sequence encodes for the mazE protein. This protein is the antitoxin for the mazF toxin (BBa_K2142003). Together the parts form the mazF/mazE system which can be used as selectable marker. This part is not a standard BioBrick and ca be found in BBa_K2142000 Sequence and Features
BBa_K2142003
This sequence encodes for the mazF protein. This protein is the toxin for the mazE antitoxin (BBa_K2142001). Together the parts form the mazF/mazE system, which can be used as selectable marker. This part is not a standard BioBrick and can be found in BBa_K2142005 Sequence and Features.
BBa_K2142004
The sequence encodes for the dam methylase. This methylase is normally important for methylating DNA after replication. In our project we over expressed the translation of the protein, which leads to a mutation increase by the factor of 50. The part is no standard BioBrick and can be found in BBa_K2142005 Sequence and Features
BBa_K2142006
This sequence encodes for the ccdA protein. This protein is the antitoxin for the ccdB toxin. Together the parts form the ccdA/ccdB system, which can be used as selectable marker. This part is not a standard BioBrick and can be found in BBa_K2142007
