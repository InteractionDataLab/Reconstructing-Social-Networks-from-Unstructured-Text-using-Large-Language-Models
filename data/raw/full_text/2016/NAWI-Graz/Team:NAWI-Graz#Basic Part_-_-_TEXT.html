BioBricks/Basic Parts
BBa_K2142001
This sequence encodes for the mazE protein. This protein is the antitoxin for the mazF toxin (BBa_K2142003). Together the parts form the mazF/mazE system which can be used as selectable marker. This part is not a standard BioBrick and ca be found in BBa_K2142000 Sequence and Features
BBa_K2142003
This sequence encodes for the mazF protein. This protein is the toxin for the mazE antitoxin (BBa_K2142001). Together the parts form the mazF/mazE system, which can be used as selectable marker. This part is not a standard BioBrick and can be found in BBa_K2142005 Sequence and Features.
BBa_K2142004
The sequence encodes for the dam methylase. This methylase is normally important for methylating DNA after replication. In our project we over expressed the translation of the protein, which leads to a mutation increase by the factor of 50. The part is no standard BioBrick and can be found in BBa_K2142005 Sequence and Features
BBa_K2142006
This sequence encodes for the ccdA protein. This protein is the antitoxin for the ccdB toxin. Together the parts form the ccdA/ccdB system, which can be used as selectable marker. This part is not a standard BioBrick and can be found in BBa_K2142007
