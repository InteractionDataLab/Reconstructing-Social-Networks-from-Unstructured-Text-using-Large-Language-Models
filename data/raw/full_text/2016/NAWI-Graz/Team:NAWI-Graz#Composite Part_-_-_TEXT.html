Composite parts sent to the registry
BBa_K2142000
This part was used to make our E.coli resistant against the mazF toxin they should produce. For this reason the expressed the mazE antitoxin (BBa_K2142001). Further we used Anderson promoters and RBS to be sure our proteins are expressed constitutive. This was very important for the reason the Antitoxin has a really short half-life and the chromoprotein was used to detect the winner. At the end of the part we used a bidirectional double terminator, which also terminated the transcription of BBa_K2142005.
BBa_K2142005
In our project we used this composite part to let our E.coli attack with the mazF toxin (BBa_K2142003). Further this part contains a Dam methylase (BBa_K2142004) for the reason this protein leads due to over expression to an increased mutation rate. For the reason toxin production and mutation can cause problems during assembling and testing the expression of the proteins can be induced with IPTG. This part belongs to BBa_K2142000.
BBa_K2142007
This part was used to make our E.colis resistant against the ccdB toxin they should produce. For this reason they expressed the (BBa_K2142006). Further we used Anderson promoters and RBS to be sure our proteins are expressed constitutive. This was very important for the reason the Antitoxin has a real short half-life and the chromoprotein was used to detect the winner. At the end of the part we used a bidirectional double terminator, which also terminated the transcription of BBa_K2142005.
