Communication help
To make our project come true, we created an account on Ulule, which is the first European crowdfunding website. We presented our project to the general public in order to collect enough funds to have the opportunity to go to the Giant Jamboree in Boston. Indeed, the set objective of €1,250 corresponded to the plane tickets fee for two of our team members. We are proud to say that we had 45 contributors and collected €1,402 !
