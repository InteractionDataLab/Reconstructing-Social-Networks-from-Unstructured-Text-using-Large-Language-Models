Device
Our whole project rests on the bacteria, which is programmed to cure the cave. However, the bacteria was genetically modified, and thus it is important to ensure the bacteria confinement. Indeed, the bacteria must not be released in the environment to avoid the natural ecosystem’s disruption.
The conception of the device has not for sole objective to confine Bacillus subtilis, because it has also the advantage to ease the application of bacteria on the walls.
Throughout its modern design, our device is quite easy to use and gathers several functions. First of all, let’s talk about its aspect. The device is a double hollow half spheres separated by a layer of air. The spheres are in a hard material, and the base of it is made in a flexible material, able to match the reliefs of the cave’s wall.
The device is portative and has to be placed against the wall thanks to two handles. As soon as it is positioned on the stains caused by microorganisms, it is necessary to push a button and the vacuum will be done between the two half spheres. Thus the device will be maintained against the wall because of the negative pressure.
Now that the device is placed, our super bacteria can come into play. Another button activates the pulverisation of bacteria in a liquid medium, from the top of the smallest half sphere to the rocky wall. At the contact of fungi and colored bacteria, our modified Bacillus subtilis will use these microorganisms to grow and reduce their population. When they will disappear, the colored stains should also be vanished. Thus, our bacteria will not have enough nutrients to grow, and thus will be naturally eliminated. Finally, the device can be taken off from the wall by reintroducing air between the two half spheres.
Following the development of our B. subtilis is important to determine when the device can be removed. As a consequence, UV lights are fixed in the apparatus, and highlight the natural fluorescence of Bacillus subtilis.
