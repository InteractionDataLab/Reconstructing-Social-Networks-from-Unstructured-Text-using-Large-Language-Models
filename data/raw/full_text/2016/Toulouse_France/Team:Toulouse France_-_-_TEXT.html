iGEM Toulouse Team presents
Paleotilis, a shield for the Lascaux cave
Back to the origins
What if iGEM stepped 18,000 years back?
At that time, cavemen painted extraordinary frescoes on the Lascaux cave (France). The cave remained stable until its discovery in 1940, which deeply disturbed its ecosystem. It was closed shortly after mainly because of contamination by fungi that causes colored spots on the frescoes. Nowadays, mechanical and chemical solutions are monthly used and the cave is still in danger due to their limited efficiency.
At iGEM Toulouse, we thought about an innovative biological solution based on the last advances in synthetic biology. It consists in an engineered Bacillus subtilis strain which grow on bacterial organisms present in the cave. It releases antifungals when in close viscinity of fungi. Since we care about environment, an inducible riboswitch-based double toxin/antitoxin system was created to prevent DNA transmission and a physical device was designed to confine our strain.

Results
The different biobricks we constructed have been tested to measure their efficiency. There you will have an overview of the results.

Human Practices
Lot of projects and events have been done by the iGEM Toulouse team. We aimed to explain synthetic biology, to debate about the use of GMOs and to transmit what we have learnt.
