Safe Project Design
FlavOFF project Focused in 3 steps:
Used human DNA -Taqman reactions on Fluidigm chip.
CRISPR cas9- cut in-vitro.
Used bacteria-DH5α-for bio-bricks preparation.
The DH5α bacteria are classified as biosafety level 1 organisms.
The human DNA and bacteria used in all experiments are classified as biosafety level 1 organisms; all are harmless and were used under well-established protocols and with proper guidance and safety equipment.
A minor potential danger to the general public from this project as well as many others is the possibility of antibiotic resistance E. coli. We have minimized the range by using only 1 type of antibiotics in the bio- brick work (chloramphenicol).
Another important fact is that E. coli was used in our experiments only as a method to propagate plasmids, the plasmids themselves never contained bacterial promoters for our transgenes, and even if they did, all the proteins they are translated into, are harmless proteins.
Sending the bio bricks to the Igem library was executed precisely as per instructions published on the contest website.
Safety Lab Work
Responsible for lab safety is the Safety Officer; however, all lab work followed the strict and clear rules and regulations when working in the lab.
All lab work and experiments were done according to laboratory safety policies at G.G.A - Galil Genetic Analysis and Danciger Darca High School. The lab team was trained and guided by lab members and instructors of Prof. Dani Bercovich in the lab for the entire time of our work to ensure the safety and health of team members and lab workers alike.
The main safety aspects of our daily routine in the lab included 3 parts:
Personal safety: all work in the lab was done with gloves, safety glasses, closed leather shoes and lab coats.
Keeping our benches clean and organized: work benches were cleaned and sterilized with ethanol at the end of every work day. Waste was separated into Biological waste and regular waste.
Special areas for different types of work - our lab was divided into 3 parts:
The first part was for working with human DNA (biosafety cabinets, separated DNA room).
The second part (fume hood and a nearby bench) was designated to work with Ethidium bromide and gel-electrophoresis only.
The third part of the lab was designated to the regular lab work (plasmid purification, restriction analysis and etc.).
Safety Shipment
We didn't face any special safety problems in sending our DNA parts.
