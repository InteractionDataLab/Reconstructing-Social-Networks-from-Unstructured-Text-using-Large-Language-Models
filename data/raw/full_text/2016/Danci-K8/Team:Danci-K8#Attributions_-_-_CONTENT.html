interests him more:</P><P>The laboratory team work under the guidance of Professor Berkovich who served as the scientific

advisor of the group. We implemented this in practice the experiment and of course planned the next

step into the night. Professor Berkovich helped us to examine the results and move on to the next stage

of the experiment. Completion of the scientific knowledge was done with our staff of teachers; we

studied the methods together from the Internet. The data processing was done by the team, primarily

by the members who are strong in mathematics.</P><P>The Community Working Group worked completely independently. The teachers assisted us technically

to make the events that occurred at school come real, all the initiatives were ours, the students. This

group was also used for documenting the entire process, Writing surveys and their implementation.</P><P>Our English teacher Dave helped us with the rhetoric of the presentation in a professional manner, with

emphasis on fluent English.</P><P>The site was the most complex, but for that there are friends who helped. 2 members of the group

(computer geeks) built the site together; whenever they had a problem our math teacher gave them a

solution – Ofir and classmates who are also addicted to computers.</P><P>After a long and extremely busy summer we would like to say:</P><P>We would like to thank all the generous donors, where without them it would have been impossible to be part of this competition.
