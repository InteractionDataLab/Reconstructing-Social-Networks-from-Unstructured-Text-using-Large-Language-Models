The “FLAVOFF" team
Danciger Darca Comprehensive High School is situated in the northernmost city in Israel -  Kiryat Shmona. The city is at a crossroad between Lebanon and Syria, the city has been bombed  numerous times over the years from Lebanon due to the tense situation in the region.
Kiryat Shmona has one central comprehensive high school with 1400  students from seventh through twelfth grade. Darca Danciger is a public  school.
The school is a public school housing 1400 students. There are a variety of students starting  with students of excellence who are aimed at dealing with engineering fields in the future,  medicine and trade in Israel. The school has 8 classes for students with special needs including  regular students and youth at risk. The school students are Israeli citizens, former Lebanese  citizens and residents from the Golan Heights (former Syrian citizens). The school practices and  educates tolerance and love towards the other.
With a goal to pass on the knowledge in Synthetic Biology all around the country to the  different religions, the city’s residents, the Kibbutz and village, to senior students and young  children as well as the blind and elderly, all of these audiences met our Biotechnology major  students in order to get introduced to another field of knowledge – Synthetic Biology.
Since Israel is an immigrants' country, we tried to determine if origin changes the phenotype  and genotype of the sense of taste.
You are invited to dive into the MAGIC of TASTE…

Einav Bar Hanin
Qualifications: Second degree in environmental science.   Profession: Biotechnology teacher at the school and homeroom teacher.   Team: The combination of working with students and synthetic biology is something I have  always wanted to do. It is a privilege to educate children and have an impact on their  present and future.The idea of synthetic biology is amazing to me – taking theoretical  knowledge, and with design and engineering turning it into a game of upgraded lego with  useful products.
Dave Dubb
Originally from South Africa has been teaching English as a second language since 2002 and  at Danciger Darca High School since 2007. He studied TESL and ran his own language school  online and offline until he began working at the school. Currently he teaches sophomore and  senior students at the school.

Prof. Dani Bercovich
Prof. Dani Bercovich specializes in performance of complex genetic screening of human  genomic DNA. More particularly, when the location of a genomic component is unknown,  Prof. Bercovich is assisted in revealing new genes associated with human disease, by linkage  testing techniques (genetic chips with SNP) or by Next-Generation- Sequencing of the entire  human EXOM. New gene mutations, identified in the laboratory studies (Galil Genetic  Analysis lab (GGA lab)) of Prof. Bercovich, are commonly used for intracellular studies and  identification of the biological effects they cause. In recent years, using genetic chips,  Professor Bercovich has also developed new diagnostic methods. With his state of the art  knowledge, Professor Bercovich is a world-recognized expert in Molecular Genetics and has  published more than 70 peer-reviewed articles in high impact journals including.
Magi Mualem
Qualifications: Second degree in biotechnology.   Profession: 20 years teaching biotechnology and biology at Danciger Darca High School. Vice  principal at the school since 2008.   Team: Magi is the driving force of the team. Integrating the different teams and offers ideas  to progress and improve the project. Magi is a parent-teacher- laboratory assistant-age affairs  advisor figure for the entire team.
Hana Brandes
Hannah holds a degree in physics. Alongside her love of science of physics and science in general  Hannah has gained a special love for the science of biotechnology. Hannah is the thinking and  operational head for quite a few unique biotechnology projects carried out. In each of the projects  Hannah has a crucial role in leading the students through the preparation labs, monitors the students' research processes and mainly through her love towards the students every new school year.
Gita Reinitz
Gita Reinitz is the COO and co- founder of CrisprIL. Her passion is helping scientists both  young and old with their Crispr projects and importing quality Crispr products from around  the world to keep Israel at the cutting edge of gene editing, at low prices and quick  turnaround times so that anyone can access this technology.
