Thanks to:
We exposed the idea in every way possible: social networks, in the center of the  business district, at the “Science Night” event, targeted interviews, by using the local  and national media. We built a marketing layout and explanation in school and  therefore we also held the convention with the classes of excellence. During the  conference a philosophical discussion was held and dealt with genetic modification.
We conducted an opinion poll for the locals and for the other teams competing in  IGEM.
