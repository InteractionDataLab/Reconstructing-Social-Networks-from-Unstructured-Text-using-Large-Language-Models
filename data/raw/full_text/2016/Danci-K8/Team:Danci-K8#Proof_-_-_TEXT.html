Stage one
We made sure to create a relatively varied testing system with the number alleles for each of the five tastes that were being checked.
The people we checked filled out a questionnaire while doing the phenotype test, (characterization of the ability to recognize and feel tastes in practice). The questionnaire was analyzed statistically from the test results.
Whenever we found a match between the SNP and the sequence tested, the DNA polymerase continued the process of reproduction; the probe was freed and formed a fluorescent signal. We compared the results to the genotype test for all tastes, and for each taste with a number of SNP’s.
We engineered the SNP to be used for negative monitoring.
Finally we found a match between genotype phenotype which collected in the study.
Stage two
The “Flavoff” system is derived from a number of steps that depend on each other. The occurrence in the last stage, meaning, cutting the suitable SNP and obtaining the expected modifications, prove the venture feasibility of "Flavoff ". Various combinations of gRNA would be expressed and DNA run on a gel to check for expected band sizes. A comprehensive results analysis will further substantiate the feasibility estimate
Running negative control A – using the fifth gRNA molecule which is not supposed to identify the encoded SNP for the specific different taste receptors. There is no expected cut by Cas9 in this monitor.
Running negative control B – using the vector including a negative construct which does not encode any significant SNP. There is no expected cut by Cas9 in this control.
