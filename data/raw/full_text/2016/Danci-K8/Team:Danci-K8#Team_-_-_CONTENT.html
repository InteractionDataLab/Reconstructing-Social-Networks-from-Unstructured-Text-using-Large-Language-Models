medicine and trade in Israel. The school has 8 classes for students with special needs including

regular students and youth at risk. The school students are Israeli citizens, former Lebanese

citizens and residents from the Golan Heights (former Syrian citizens). The school practices and

educates tolerance and love towards the other.</P><P>With a goal to pass on the knowledge in Synthetic Biology all around the country to the

different religions, the city’s residents, the Kibbutz and village, to senior students and young

children as well as the blind and elderly, all of these audiences met our Biotechnology major

students in order to get introduced to another field of knowledge – Synthetic Biology.</P><P>Since Israel is an immigrants' country, we tried to determine if origin changes the phenotype

always wanted to do. It is a privilege to educate children and have an impact on their

present and future.The idea of synthetic biology is amazing to me – taking theoretical

knowledge, and with design and engineering turning it into a game of upgraded lego with

useful products.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="view view-first"><DIV class="mask"><H2>Dave Dubb</H2><P style="font-size: 13px;">Originally from South Africa has been teaching English as a second language since 2002 and

genomic DNA. More particularly, when the location of a genomic component is unknown,

Prof. Bercovich is assisted in revealing new genes associated with human disease, by linkage

testing techniques (genetic chips with SNP) or by Next-Generation- Sequencing of the entire

human EXOM. New gene mutations, identified in the laboratory studies (Galil Genetic

Analysis lab (GGA lab)) of Prof. Bercovich, are commonly used for intracellular studies and

identification of the biological effects they cause. In recent years, using genetic chips,

Professor Bercovich has also developed new diagnostic methods. With his state of the art
