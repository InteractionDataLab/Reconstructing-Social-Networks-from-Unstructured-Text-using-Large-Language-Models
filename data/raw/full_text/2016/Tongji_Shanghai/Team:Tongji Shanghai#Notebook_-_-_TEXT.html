UCNP construction
Part1 synthesis of UCNPs:
Prepare mixture I and mixture II. Mix I is the mixture of MnCl2(0.5mL, 0.5M), Yb(NO3)3(0.9mL,0.2M), Er(NO3)3(0.1mL, 0.2M), Y(NO3)3(1.1mL, 0.5M) and the mix II is the mixture of NaOH(0.3g), deionized water (1.5 mL), oleicacid (5 mL) and ethanol (10 mL).
Then, 2.0mL of deionized water contained 4 mmol of NaF was dropwise added to the mixture.
After vigorous stirring at room temperature for 15 min, the colloidal solution weretransferred into a 25 mL Teflon-lined autoclave, sealed and heated at 200 °C for 8h.
The systems were then allowed to naturally cool to room temperature.
The finalproducts were collected by means of centrifugation, washed with ethanol anddeionized water for several times to remove any possible remnants, and then dried invacuum at 70 °C to obtain the dried UCNPs powder.
Part2 synthesis of GQDs:
sodium copper chlorop(SCC)Use deionized water to prepare a concentration of 0.2M of SCC and heat it at 180℃ for 12h.
Centrifugate(room temperature, 7000rpm, 10min) and remove the supernanant.
Scrub the precipitate by deionized water 3 times.
Add 20mLaqua regia and condensing reflux at 90℃ for 1h. After that, the precipitate would turn yellow.
Scrub the precipitate by deionized water 3 times.
Add 5.0mL hydrazine hydrate and stir. Then, the precipitate would back to black.
Scrub the precipitate by deionized water 3 times.
Store it with 2.0mL ddH2O at room temperature.
Part3 synthesis of UCNPs with SiO2 and GQDs
Mix Co-520(0.1mL), cyclohexane(6.0mL) and UCNPs(4.0mL, 0.01M dissolved in cyclohexane) and stir for 10min.
Add Co-520(0.4mL) and ammonia(0.08mL, 30%).
Then obturate vessel and sonicate for 20min.
Add absolute ethyl alcohol(2.0mL), GQDs(100μL), TEOS(0.04mL) and stir at 600rpm for 2 days.
Add acetone until the solution becomes cloudy and centrifugate at 6000rpm for 10min.
Scrub the precipitate by the mixture of deionized water and ethanol(volume ratio is 1:1) 2 times and store in deionized water.
Part4 photothermal property of integrative material
We test the photothermal property of UCNPs, UCNPs with SiO2 and GQDs, UCNPs with SCC, GQDs, SCCat irradiation of 670nm and 980nm laser separately to confirm that the thermal effect is mainly caused by the SCC absorbing 670nm laser converted via UCNPs absorbing 980nm laser.
GNR construction
Part 1. Synthesis of AuNRs
GNRs are synthesized through the seedless growth route. The growth solution is made from a stepwise mixing CTAB (cetyl trimethyl ammonium bromide) aqueous solution and HAuCl4 aqueous solution (1mM,5ml). Then add AgNO3 aqueous solution slowly with stirring, followed by AA aqueous solution, and stop stirring when the solution is transparent. Finally the growth of AuNRs is induced by injecting freshly-prepared ice-cold NaBH4 aqueous solution. The resultant solution needs to be kept undisturbed at room temperature for 6 hours.[2]
The concentration and material volume are listed as following:
CTAB(cetyl trimethyl ammonium bromide): 0.2M 5ml
HAuCl4(chloroauric acid):1mM5ml
NaBH4(sodium borohydrate):0.01M 15μl
AA(ascorbic acid):78.8mM 70μl
AgNO3(silvernitrate)：4mM 300μl
Part 2. Au concentration measurements
The as-synthesized AuNRs is purified by three cycles of centrifugation to remove excessive Au ions. Afterwards, the precipitates are dissolved with aqua regia and diluted by deionized water. An ICP-OES (inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer) is applied for measuring the ratio of reacted HAuCl4.
Part 3. Photothermal application of GNRs
First, we test UV–vis-NIR extinction spectra of the AuNRs.
Second, we test the photothermal effect of the AuNRs. We prepare a 200μl aqueous suspension of AuNRs with different concentration in anadiabatic box. Then irradiate with laser for 10 minutes. The laser we use is an 808nm laser generator. We test the AuNRs at different power density.
Third, we test the photothermal stability of the AuNRs. We irradiate the GNRs solution from an ambient temperature to the top temperature for consecutive four cycles, testing whether the top temperature will change or not.
We record the temperature every 1 minute.
Part 4. Surface modification
In our experiment, we use poly ethylene glycol (PEG) to minimized dose-related side effects of single AuNRs.
The treatment is mixing prepared AuNRs with PEG and leaving undisturbed at room temperature for 24h. The final concentration of PEG is 0.8mg/ml.[3]
Part 5. Material toxicity test
Results:
We get AuNRs with an aspect ratio of~3.9(41.9 × 10.6 nm), the transmission electron microscopy(TEM) image is shown as figure1(a),the TEM image clearly indicates that the products are single crystals and the shape is quite even.
As to the AuNRs with the aspect ratio of 3.9, two LSPR peaks at 546 and 770 nm are observed (figure 1(b)).The former arises from the transverse resonant oscillation, while the latter results from the resonant oscillation[1], the LSPR range of the AuNRs is wide in near infrared region.
The temperature variation of the GNRs is revealed by irradiating a 200μl aqueous solution using an 808 nm laser. The temperature increases obviously(figure 1(c)) as the increase of the GNRs concentration. In addition, as the laser power density increases, the temperature increment is higher, because more energy is absorbed by the solution (figure 1(d)).Figure 1(e) shows that the top temperature is almost unchanged after four cycles, which indicates the photothermal stability of GNRs. These results indicate that the GNRs synthesized by us possess good photothermal property and stability.
Biosafety:
The photothermal stability test result indicates that the AuNRs exhibits excellent photothermal stability. So it can be irradiated by laser many times with its properties unchanged. The cyto-toxicity of CTAB-GNRs is independent of their aspect ratio[4]. And the cell toxicity experiment shows that the toxicity of the AuNRs is dose-related.When the AuNRs concentration is low, it doesn’t show obvious cell toxicity, but it exhibits cell toxicity with the concentration increase. The cell toxicity is the result of the AuNRs caninduce cell apoptosis and autophagy by damaging mitochondria and activating intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS).[4]Surface modifications have been extensively used to improve the biocompatibility and stability of gold nanorods. Our results show that with the surface modification of PEG, the toxicity of the AuNRs decreased dramatically. In a word, all of the results testify that our material have well-controlled biosafety both in material stability and its cell toxicity.
