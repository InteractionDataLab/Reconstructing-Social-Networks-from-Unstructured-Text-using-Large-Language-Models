Abstract
We want to create a Golden Era for breast cancer patients with system OPTT (optimized photothermal therapy), a breast tumor killer.
Breast cancer is the culprit which breaks up hundreds of thousands of women’s delicate beauty and health. Photothermal therapy (PTT) has exhibited the significant potential for solid tumors treatment. However, it still has some drawbacks including off-target effect and the lack of visualization towards agent delivery.
To minimize the shortcomings, we have designed OPTT (optimized photothermal therapy), a novel treatment and report system which can achieve visualization and reduce the off-target effect of original photothermal therapy.
By combining gold nanorods with constructed plasmids, our system will open a Golden Era for breast cancer patients. Era is the acronym of “Efficiency, Reporter and Accuracy”, which generalizes the characteristics of our products. We have promoted the efficiency of photothermal therapy by constructing plasmid HTert-P53 and Hsp70-P53-luceferase to mount the thermosensitivity of tumor cells but not normal cells. With the aid of luciferase, we can observe if the tumor cells had been heat treated, which can solve the visualization problem. Beyond that, accuracy is escalated as off-target effect is diminished. The superiorities will render our system a vigorous arm to help defeat breast cancer in clinical application for the rebirth of the suffering patients in the future.

Efficiency
We have promoted the efficiency of photothermal therapy by constructing plasmid HTert-P53 and Hsp70-P53-luceferase to mount the thermosensitivity of tumor cells.
Reporter
With the aid of luciferase, we can observe if the tumor cells had been heat treated in in vivo bioluminescence imaging machine with the injection of luciferase substance.
Accuracy
Beyond that, accuracy is escalated as off-target effect is diminished. The superiorities will render our system a vigorous arm to help defeat breast cancer in clinical application for the rebirth of the suffering patients in the future.
