The idea of this project was conceived by the team; advisors and instructors gave advices and suggestions on the implementation of this idea. All the data presented on this wiki was measured, collected, and analyzed by the team members. All the plasmids directly involved in the data presented on this wiki were constructed by the team members. The idea conceiving, content planning, execution, and result analysis of human practice were all done by the team members. The following is the detailed attribution:
