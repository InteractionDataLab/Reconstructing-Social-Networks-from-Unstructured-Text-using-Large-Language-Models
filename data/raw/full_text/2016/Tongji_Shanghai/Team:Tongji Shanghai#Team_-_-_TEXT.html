ZHANG JiaweiCaptain
Team leader. In charge of kit building, human practice and collaboration.
A man who set his track to be a biology researcher, not traditional but more creative and suits to the market.A man who dreamed of building the iron man suit, not for war purpose, but to strengthen human body, even enable those unable.                     A man who does not be restricted by knowledge, trying to apply what he learned to make his body fit, his family healthy, his skin more smooth.
A man who desire to be more than a student in his 20s, who shoots commercials, does modeling before camera, and acting in TVs.                     A man who dares do all that may become a man, who dares more is none.

I am Chao Zhang, professor of life and science institute in Tongji University. I am the first PI of team Tongji_Shanghai.
During the process of lab work, I mentor them for basic lab instructions, lab safety, and teach them basic skills. It’s quite a pleasure to see them improve, overcome and achieve. Regardless of the result, I am proud of how far they had reach.Synthetic biology is the tool to the future, i hope this competition can help better understand the theme of synthetic biology, more importantly expand their horizon.
LI WeidaInstructor
Prof. LI Weida
I am professor Weida Li. I am responsible for trails building. I have meetings with Team Tongji_Shanghai members, sometimes they don’t know how to analysis the results or in the dark of what to do. I do not take part into their experiments, but served as a navigator. I do hope that after all this, they can have a better picture of how to design an experiment and how to move on, which will be critical to not only their projects, but also their lives.
LE RongrongInstructor
DR. LE Rongrong
I am Rongrong Le, Second PI of Tongji-Shanghai. For 9 months, I have tutored team members how to do experiments, and assistant prof.Chao Zhang to keep an eye on them. During the group meetings, we shared ideas with each other, some of their thought also influenced my idea. We really have a good time !
JIA WenwenInstructor

Hi, I'm Wenwen Jia, instructor of team Tongji-Shanghai. During the project, I tutored my students how to build the plasmid of Htert+P53, and I provided them cells of HTert negative. In other time, I took part in experiment design and result analysis. I sincerely hope that my students get a good ending.
HAO MengInstructor

Hey guys, this is Heidi saying hi from Shanghai. It's really a huge honor and pleasure for me to join the iGEM this year. Currently I work as an international program coordinator of School of Life Sciences and Technology, Tongji University and I will be the guiding teacher of the 2015 iGEM representative team of Tongji University.
I have strong confidence in all of them that they would make a great difference here on their debut, with their extraordinary courage and dedication. While what really matters to us is nothing but the precious experience where we can see the world and gain growth. Can't wait to meet you all in Boston! Cheers!

CHEN Xinhong, FENG Yu
2015 Tongji iGEMer
Hello, we are Xinhong Chen and Yu Feng, members of team Tongji 2015. One year ago, we brought gold medals to school, which was a treasured memory.
Today, it will be turns of my younger brothers and sisters, we believe that I should be responsible for helping them. In the early days of this team, we help them to build the team, and introduced the concept of genetically engineering. Not until they had set their own project and carried on did we set them free and let them to explore. Right now, we are in MIT for graduation design. It feels fascinating to return to MIT after a year, and we will meet team Tongji 2016 to witness their success!
WU Yiyun
Art Consultant
Hello!I'm Yiyun Wu,majored in Electrical Engineering and Automation.It's a really significative chance for me to have a touch with different academic realm in this time.
I'm interested in drawing and It's excellent for me to expound my ideas by drawing manga and other works in my spare time.So,It's my pleasure to offer some help to the team for the picture designing. And in the mean time,it's also meaningful for me to have a contact with the competition and learn something new from the team.
