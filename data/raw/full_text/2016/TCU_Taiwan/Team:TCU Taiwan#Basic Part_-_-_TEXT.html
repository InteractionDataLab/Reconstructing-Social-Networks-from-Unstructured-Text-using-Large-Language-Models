SgrS BS:
The SgrS BS sequence consist of ptsG sequence, the transcription of the ptsG sequence will produce ptsG mRNA which this mRNA will help to the production of glucose transporter IICBglc , this will help the uptake of glucose . But the mechanism of ptsG to become IICBglc can be blocked by the presence of the SgrS. SgrS can be produced by the help of the SgrR when the concentration of glucose is high
Red color chromoprotein:
It's a Fluorescent gene which expresses red color once the gene is expressed.
(From  iGEM11_Uppsala-Sweden)
SgrS BS + RED color chromoprotein Once the recombinant gene is expressed:
(In the presence a lot of glucose) SgrS will bind with the sequence of recombinant mRNA , and it will degrade the activation of ptsG with the help of RNase and another cofactor, resulting in no red color produced because it's also bind with the ptsG sequence.
(In the presence of low glucose) SgrS will be produced in low level and the number of SgrS is not effective enough to degrade the presence of the ptsG sequence , resulting red color will be still produced.
