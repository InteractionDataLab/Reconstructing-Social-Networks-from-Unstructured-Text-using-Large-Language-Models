                                                                                                              Imaging use fron NCKU-Collaborations
They shared the protocol and sent the material for 1000ml of Glucose-free modified M9 medium for cell culturing and functional experiments for us.
Protocol for modified M9:
For preparing 10X M9 stock
Formulation
Disodium Phosphate Heptahydrate 128 g/L
Monopotassium Phosphate 30 g/L
Sodium Chloride 5 g/L
Ammonium Chloride 10 g/L
Final pH (2X solution): 6.6–7.0 at 25°C
After dilution to 1X and autoclave, for every 20 ml, add
20% D-Glucose solution 400ul
1.0 M MgSO4 solution 40ul
1.0 M CaCl2 solution 2ul
20% Casamino acid 200ul
2.Drylab In the Internet(Facebook)
Collaboration with NCKU:
Both of us are doing the project about glucose detection, we discuss some issues about how E. coli react when glucose is added and share the information and difficulties.
Further,we also collaborate modeling in the Internet on Facebook
