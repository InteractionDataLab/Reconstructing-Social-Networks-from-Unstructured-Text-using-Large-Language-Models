NOTEBOOK
Proof Of Concept
A good product must be tested for both its accuracy and effectiveness. To test Chromo Diabetector, we design an experiment to test the various concentration of glucose level and see how the color changes. Different concentration of glucose will cause the color of the Chromo Diabetector present differently. This enables us to make a measurement strip that can be used as a reference for the users to determine their glucose level by comparing the color changes of the Chormo Diabetector to the color gradient on the measurement strip.
We also collected urine samples from those who are suffering from Type II diabetes, tooking their urine and tested it with our product. The color change of the product will give us a confirmation that we got the gradient of the measurement strip right and the product can be released to the public.
