The Principle of Chromo Diabetector begins when the glucose enters E. coli, it will be transported and phosphorylated by the IICBGLC glucose transporter. The glucose will then be metabolized by the E. coli and then produced glucose phosphate stress. This will activate the SgrR to synthesize the SgrS while the ptsG mRNA expresses continuously. The ptsG mRNA degradation requires RNA chaperon Hfq and RNase E, this will make the ptsG mRNA degrade.
Having known there’s a relationship between SgrS, ptsG, and glucose, our team decided to create one product that can measure diabetes. Here are the relation between these three factors: 1. When glucose concentration is high, SgrS will appear at a high level, thus ptsG mRNA will be degraded and will be expressed in the low level. 2. When the glucose concentration is low, SgrS will appear at low level, while the ptsG mRNA will be at a high level.
In our project, the gene of the ptsG sequence will be connected with red color chromo protein via fusion protein technique, resulting the red color in the beginning. To indicate the presence of glucose, we add the Hxt1 promoter on the other side of plasmid and connect it with a blue chromo protein so that the color of our product would change from red to blue with the presence of glucose. The Hxt1 promoter is a glucose sensor that can be induced by glucose. When the glucose concentration is high, the glucose will bind onto the Hxt1 promoter and thus triggering the expression of the blue chromo protein.
In the case of a low glucose concentration, the ptsG mRNA may not be fully degraded by SgrS so it might still produce a little red color with a little blue color. On the other hand, in the case of a high glucose concentration, the ptsG mRNA will be totally degraded by SgrS causing the color to change totally from red to blue due to the expression of the blue chromo protein.
