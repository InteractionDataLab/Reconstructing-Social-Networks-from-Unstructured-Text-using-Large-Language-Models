If our product can be accepted by the public, we would want to increase its accuracy by adding the Hxt1 + blue color chromo protein. We planned to add this sequence into the Chromo Diabetector so that it is easier to create a red-blue color gradient. The color of our product will transform from red to blue if there is a high concentration of glucose. By adding the blue chromo protein, we believe that it would be easier to determine whether or not we have Type II diabetes.
We also look forward to improving the application of our product, we planned to install our Chromo Diabetector inside of the toilet, so that when we peeing inside of the public urinal we can immediately get the result whether we have Diabetes Type 2 or not. We planned to use color detection inside of the toilet so that the color will be detected by the detector, then the computer will give the result and the give an advice for what should they do to reduce the chance to get diabetes, or maybe the computer will tell them to see the doctor. We believe in the future this tools will have a good benefit, many lives will be saved because there is an early warning for them about diabetes.
Our future project to improve the effectivities of Chromo Diabetector for its accuracy and application will meet a bigger challenge than what we have already faced this time. We hope we can improve Chromo Diabetector so that many lives can be saved before it’s going to be late.
