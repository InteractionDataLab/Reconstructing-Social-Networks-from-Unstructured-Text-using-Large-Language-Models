Facebook Fan Page
We have our very own Facebook fan page. We will share interesting news and also activities to let other people know what we are doing. We would also share informations regarding synthetic biology and genetic engineering in hope to inspire others to join us in our journey in the field of genetic engineering.
We also use our page to share our product, what iGEM is all about and also to make surveys.
TCU News
TCU News is our universityâ€™s very own news team. Their news are displayed at every electronic notice board all around the campus. Students will look at these electronic notice boards while waiting for the elevator or when they are having their meal at the cafeteria.
By making onto the news, we are able to promote our product and also what iGEM is all about.
TCU News
Chinatimes Online is a national online news platform. We are also very honored that the editors are willing to collaborate with us and to publish news about us.
By making onto Chinatimes Online, we are able to spread the awareness of Type II diabetes among youngsters much more efficiently because the target audience for Chinatimes Online is actually university students.
Therefore making on to Chinatimes is a big leap for us.
