We also went to Tzu Chi Hospital to have a meeting with Doctor Chu Shao Yin, a pediatrician specialising in children diabetes. We told her about our project and she also gave us some advice and also some suggestion to improve our product. We introduced iGem to her and she was fascinated by what iGem is doing. 
She also shared with us her data on Type II diabetes and also gave us some papers regarding type II diabetes for our reference. We had a great time and also got a lot of information regarding type II diabetes from our meeting with Dr. Chu Shao Yin.

We went to the department of Life Science and also the department of Human Genetics and Molecular biology at our university to promote our project, the Chromo Diabetector and also to promote iGem.
 As we were promoting, there were many students who were interested in this competition. It is happy to see that more and more students are aware of this activity and hopefully more people can participate and we can see more eye-opening innovations in the future.

We attended the iGem Asia-Pacific conference organised by NCKU at Tainan. There were teams from Taiwan, China and Hong Kong that attended the conference. We presented our projects and also exchanged thoughts and ideas on how to make our project better. From this conference, we also learnt that there are many factors that we did not take into consideration while we were designing our project. There were many friends from the other teams that gave us valuable ideas and advices which enabled us to make further improvements.
Furthermore, this conference also enable us to make more new friends. From this, we had some help with our experiment and modelling parts from NCKU, SUSTC and also NCTU. Conference like this helps us to learn how to cooperate and also strengthen the bonds between 2 teams.
