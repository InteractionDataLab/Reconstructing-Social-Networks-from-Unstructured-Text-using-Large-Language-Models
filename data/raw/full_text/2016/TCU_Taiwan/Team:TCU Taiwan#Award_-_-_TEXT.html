Silver Prize
1.Experimentally validate that at least one new BioBrick Part or Device of your own design and construction works as expected. Document the characterlization of this part in the Main Page section of the Registry entry for that Device/Part. This working part must be different from the part you documented in Bronze medal criterion #4. Submit this part to the iGEM Parts Registry.
2.Convince the judges you have helped any registerd iGEM team from a high-school, different track, another university, or institution in a significant way by, for example, mentoring a new team, characterizing a part, debugging a construct, modeling/simulating their system or helping validate a software/hardware solution to a synthetic biology problem.

3. iGEM projects involve important questions beyond the bench, for example relating to (but not limited to) ethics, sustainability, social justice, safety, security, and intellectual property rights. We refer to these activities as Human Practice in iGEM. Demonstrate how your team has identified, investigated and addressed one or more of these issues in the context of your project.

Gold Prize
1. Expand on your silver medal activity by demonstrating how you have integrated the investgated issues into the design and/or execution of your project.

2. Improve the function OR characterization of a previously existing BioBrick Part or Device (created by another team, or by your own team in in a previous year of IGEM), and enter this information in the part’s page on the Registry. Please see the Registry Contribution help page for help on documenting a contribution to an existing part. This part must NOT come from your team’s 2016 range of part numbers.

3.Demonstrate a functional proof of concept of your project. Your proof of concept must consist of a BioBrick device; a single BioBrick part cannot constitute a proof of concept.
Required link: https://2016.igem.org/Team:TCU_Taiwan/Proof
4.Show your project working under real-world conditions. To achieve this criterion, you should demonstrate your whole system, or a functional proof of concept working under simulated conditions in the lab.
