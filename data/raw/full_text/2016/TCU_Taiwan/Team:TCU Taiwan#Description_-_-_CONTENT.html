Diabetes is a group of metabolic diseases which is characterized over a prolonged period hyperglycemia resulting from the defects in insulin secretion, insulin action, or both.
The chronic hyperglycemia of diabetes is associated with long-term damage, dysfunction, and failure of various organs, especially the eyes, kidneys, nerves, heart, and blood vessels.
The vast majority of cases of diabetes fall into two categories – Type I diabetes and Type II diabetes. Type I diabetes occurs when the immune system of the body attack the insulin-producing β cells in the pancreas. Due to the loss of β cells, the pancreas then produces a little insulin or no insulin at all.
On the other hand, Type II diabetes is characterized by high blood glucose levels caused by either lack of insulin or the body's inability to use insulin efficiently.
Type II diabetes usually develops among middle-aged adults or the among elderlies. However, it appears that more and more children and teenagers are developing Type II diabetes in developed countries because most of them like to eat junk food or drink too much beverage which contains high sugar.
Diabetes has become an epidemic diseases around the world, especially in developed countries. Obese people and those who lack exercise have a higher risk of developing Type II diabetes. Nowadays, many people do not take yearly medical checkups, making them unaware of their health conditions.
Having known this problem, our team (TCU_TAIWAN) wants to increase the awareness of the people to pay more attention towards their health conditions. We are also hoping that more people could detect Type II diabetes at the earlier stages.
Our project, Chromo Diabetector measures the glucose level in our urine. Those who suspect themselves suffering from Type II diabetes can use the Chromo Diabetector to carry out a simple test. If the product shows a positive result, then you should head over to the nearest hospital to consult a doctor and to carry out further tests.
Our goal is to develop a simple test that enables the user to test by himself/herself with ease. We aim to make this product as user friendly as possible so that the majority of the people can use it. The other thing is that our product will not cost a lot, thus enabling more people to be able to afford it.
