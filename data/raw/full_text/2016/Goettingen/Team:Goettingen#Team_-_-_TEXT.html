Our Team
We are a group of students from the University of Göttingen studying in the international Master Program "Microbiology and Biochemistry", and one student from the the Bachelor Program "Biology" as creative assistant. We all have experience already in laboratory work due to completed Bachelor studies and various practical courses. The fields of study include among others biochemistry, microbiology and genetics, all contributing to a diverse team.

EriC
A special place deserves EriC, our team's mascot (crafted by Ines Friedrich). He does not only love Vitamin B12, but also Göttingen, his home town. Here, you can see him in front of our Institue of Microbiology and Genetics , and the Gänseliesel, the symbol of Göttingen. Since every PhD student from our university has to kiss her after getting his degree, she is probably the most kissed girl in the world.
B12 - The Red Gold
Big and red,
Already startin’ to sweat?
Starter of riot,
Maybe you should try it.
It is essential,
Creator of a radical,
International,
But no need for a medical.
So the round starts,
At its heart
There is a cobalt ion,
Lying in state
If an enzyme attacks,
It fetches,
One of its electrons,
To go on
And there it starts,
Involved in tissue,
Blood and DNA parts,
An obvious import issue.
But don’t be shy,
It’s on your side,
That’s the reason
It will not commit treason.
Committing on B12 are
GlmS, MutB and BtuF,
But think not too far
For what they are
Natural occurring binding domains,
For the red gold,
Which remains,
Outside of the cells
As foretold.
With this small verse,
We come to an end,
Enough time spent,
THE END!
