Work of the Supervisors
Prof. Dr. Rolf Daniel
The whole project is based on Rolf Daniel's idea to overcome the barrier of cell lysis for the expensive Vitamin B12 production. When he still was an associate professor in our department, he was a supervisor for a PhD thesis dealing with the same subject matter (see below). Being the scientific visionary of the project, he schematically planned the necessary experimental roadmap to achieve our goals. Furthermore, he has always been there for the students and other supervisors for general advise.
Furthermore, he was a great help for our fundraising. Also knowing the bureaucracy of our university very well, he encouraged several instances of the university to support our project financially.
Genis Andrés Castillo Villamizar
Genis Castillo has always been the first contact for us students, if we needed help. If technical help for devices or specific protocols we never used before, or instructions and recommendations for the next experimental steps - he was always there for us.
Furthermore, he listened to all test runs of all presentations we gave as the iGEM Team, and gave advise for improvements.
Dr. Anja Poehlein
Being an expert for genomics, Anja Poehlein provided us with the different bacterial strains we needed for our project. Furthermore, she also listened to all test runs of all presentations we gave as the iGEM Team, and gave advise for improvements.
Dr. Andrea Thürmer
Andrea Thürmer kindly offered her support with being in charge for our project, if our other supervisors were prevented.
Work of the Students
We can say  proudly that all laboratory work was indeed done by ourselves. Although in most cases checked by and discussed with our supervisors, we planned most of our experiments on our own, including procuring all necessary protocols.
Our Wiki was prepared only by ourselves. Being inspired by the Design of the iGEM Team Göttingen 2014 (made by Miguel Loera) initially, we developed our own style. Being unexperienced in website design in the beginning, we worked completely self-toughed and learning by doing.
Furthermore, all artwork (as for instance postcard design, stop-motion-video, social media images, style of wiki and website), including picture and video editing was done by ourselves.
Although reviewed by our supervisors, our presentations were all conceived and designed by ourselves. Also our human practice, engagement and social media campaigns were all conceived, designed and conducted by us.
Outside the Team Rooster
Dr. Caroline Toeche-Mittler
Under supervision of Rolf Daniel, she worked on her PhD thesis "Construction of a bacterial System for the Export of Coenzyme B
" (translated title). With her work, she laid the foundation for our project.
Avril von Hoyningen-Huene
Being a member for the iGEM Team Göttingen 2015, she prepared all sketches for a stop-motion movie, which strongly inspired our stop-motion movie.
Dr. Kristin Kaiser
Also Kristin Kaiser, member of our department and very passionated photographer, was shooting some awesome group pictures for our team.
Dr. Robert Hertel
Although not being a part of the team roster, Robert Hertel always offered an open ear and sometimes gave us suggestions how to continue our work, if did not work as planned. Furthermore, he provided us with a self made vector we used for some of our test experiments.
Katrina Funkner
Katrina Funkner kindly provided us with some of her electrocompetent strains for testing purpose in the beginning of our labwork, which was a good help for us.
Dr. Jennifer Gerke
We kindly want to thank Jennifer Gerke for supervising our fluorescence microscopy experiments in our institute.
Ute Ludwig
Ute Ludwig provided us with all laboratory equipment we needed for our work. We want to thank her sincerely for her patience and constant help if we were in need of something.
Prof. Dr. Jörg Stülke
Being very successful with the iGEM Teams from Göttingen in 2012 and 2013, Jörg Stülke was the initiator of the founding of the iGEM Team 2016. He invited us into his department in December 2015, where the last iGEM Team resumed their project. This was also our initial brainstorming of our project for iGEM 2016.
