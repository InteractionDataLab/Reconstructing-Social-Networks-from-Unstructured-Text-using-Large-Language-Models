Human Practices
HP On the Road:
We went outside onto the road to come in contact with people, spread postcards with the topic synthetic biology and talked about the “fear of genes”.
Furthermore, we gave presentations at our university to inform the general public.
We also went back to school to talk about Biotechnology as a field of studying - a topic which went way to short in our school time.
HP On the Web:
We think that nowadays, using the social media is at least as important as going outside onto the road. Therefore, we also became active on Facebook and developed strategies to inform the people.
First, we asked people in a survey what they know about Vitamin B12 and about biotechnology.
We additionally started a big campaign to inform people about Vitamin B12 - a substance of which probably everyone has already heard of. However, we gave the facts probably not everyone knew about.

The Idea of Human Practice
Our understanding of human practice is to strenghthen the awareness of the importance of synthetic biology with all consequences on their own life. For instance, thinking of genetically modified crop plants, many people might have developed a negative attitude against GMOs, not being aware of the fact that the cheese they eat is probably fermented by genetically modified yeast cells.
Knowing that we are natural scientists and therefore necessarily have an understanding about synthetic biology, we try to reach people with many different other backgrounds. We did this in form of presentations, street campaigns, and the use of social media. We think that this is very important, because our work in the field of synthetic biology must be accepted by society in order to carry applicable fruits one day.
