She led the CRISPR lab work until it folded, and then joined the G-blocks team. She also contributed greatly to the storyboarding and scripting of our project video.</P><P><B>Gavin Sutton</B>: Student lab manager, and the designer and planned lab experiments. Also responsible for ordering primers and parts. Led the G-Blocks component of lab work, and was trained in the use of (but never actually used) the AiryScan confocal microscope, but for which he often did prepared the samples... Gavin was also in charge of all protein extractions, SDS-PAGE gels, and Western Blots</P><P><B>Charlotte Beloe</B>: Responsible for all communications and design aspects of our project, including drawing images for the Wiki, presentation, and banner. She also took all our photographs, which included those taken under the AiryScan microscope after she was trained by Michael Carnell. In addition to all this, she was a critical contributor to the WetLab work for Team CRISPR, and, later, the characterisation of parts</P><P><B>Maddie Wainwright</B>: In addition to all her Wetlab work in Team CRISPR, Maddie led the Integrated Human Practices component, organising and filming interviews with a diverse array of contacts. Maddie also organised and chaired our Symposium event. Maddie also picked up some skills in editing videos too!</P><P><B>Shivani Shah</B>: A stalwart of the Overexpression Team! Shivani also ran and organised all outreach activities,  included founding the Synthetic Biology Society, and organising outreach events such as Aspire. </P><P><B>Gordon Qian</B>: In charge of the iGEM wiki website design, coding, and implementation. Liaised and organised the conference at B.Inspiring. Gordon was also a great contributor to the WetLab work for the Overexpression Team</P><P><B>Associate Professor Chris Marquis</B>: Coordinator of the team and in charge of all administration. </P><P><B>Daniel Winter</B>: A PhD student and our advisor, every bit as committed as we were, who oversaw the day-to-day of Team Bleb. He came up with the (neat but unsuccessful) idea of using a nanodrop to measure OMV production. Daniel also performed all French Press experiments, mass spectrometry sample preparation, mass spectrometry data collection, and mass spectrometry data analysis. Daniel also animated our Project Video for us, and helped edit our Human Practices videos </P></DIV><H2 style="font-family: Slim-Joe; font-weight: bold;" class="text-left"> UNSW School of Biotechnology and Biomolecular Sciences</H2><DIV><P><B>Helene Lebhar</B>: Lab manager of Room 329, where all the action happened.
