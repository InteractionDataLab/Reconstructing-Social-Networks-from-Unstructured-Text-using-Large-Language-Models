Please see our main part page for a list of all parts. Below, though, are all our basic parts, i.e. those that are indivisible by 3A assembly. All are coding.
g3p: Available both with (BBa_K2022001) and without (BBa_K2022000) a his-tag
tolR: Available both with (BBa_K2022003) and without (BBa_K2022002) a his-tag
alMGS: Available both with (BBa_K2022005) and without (BBa_K2022004) a his-tag
Periplasm-Localising Fluorescence: Available in both RFP (BBa_K2022010) and GFP (BBa_K2022011) forms
Membrane-bound Fluorescence: Available in both RFP (BBa_K2022013) and GFP (BBa_K2022012) forms
Our favourite part, however, and that which we submit for the Best Part prize is BBa_K2022000. We managed to confirm its role as an inducer of hypervesiculation, by increasing both vesicle size and number.
