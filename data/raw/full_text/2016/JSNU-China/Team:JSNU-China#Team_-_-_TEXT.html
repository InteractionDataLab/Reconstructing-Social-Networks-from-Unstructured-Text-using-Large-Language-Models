Our team consists of 15 students, creating an energetic and awesome group. We come from different grades and study fields but make an excellent collaboration with each other. During this project we not only have the chance to learn synthetic biology but also expand our horizons and enrich our experience.We really appreciate this grateful competition experience because of this we meet, we fight and never give up.
Mengjiao Wang
I am a junior student and is responsible for wiki.In my school life, I take part in many school's activities, do student work and enjoy it. At the same time, doing experiments and exploring unknown world are also funny. So I decide to joining iGEM, which is an interesting competition for me.

I am a junior student in JiangSu Normal University. This is my first time to take part in IGEM, as a member of the team , I take the responsibility for design slides and poster as well as attending the whole experiment. I do gain a lot from this process. IGEM is a really awesome part of my college life.

Jingyan Gao
I once participated in the national mathematical modeling. So I can grasp the basic Matlab. I am also more interested in computer knowledge. Because I want to learn more about computer knowledge, I want to take part in the game to urge myself to study hard.

Lingmin Hou
I majored in Animal science in Jiangsu Normal university and I will become the school recommended exemption graduate. At the college I act as an assistant instructor which cultivate the ability to cope. In my spare time I like travelling and making friends which can help me cultivate good communication skills. That is why I act as human practice in our team. I am very excited to participate in iGEM and I will go all out for this.

Qi Zhang
I come from Jiangsu Normal university. Maybe my English is poor, but I hope to try my best to do something for IGEM, I am good at marking experiment, so, in this team, my work is culturing cells which are treated with anthocyanin and detecting cell activity by CCK8 kit and light microscope observation. I believe our team will be outstanding via our efforts and cooperation.

Xing Wang
I come from Jiangsu Normal University. I major in cancer molecular biology.  Today I intend to talk about something in iGEM team. As a postgraduate,it is majority of skills that undergrad could not attach to. My work that make a supporter,enzyme cutting vector,PCR, bacteria transformation and connect as so on all the works I can do practice.

Lingna Xia
I'm a sophomore, in Jiangsu Normal University, studying bio-pharmaceutical.  I’m outgoing and like sports. Maybe different from usual girls, my favorite sport is mountain biking, which can make me feel free and get acquainted with different friends. Delighted to take part in IGEM, I will cherish this chance to improve myself.
