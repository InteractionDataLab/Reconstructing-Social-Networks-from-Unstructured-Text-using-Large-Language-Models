Team:JSNU-China/Collaborations
Quick flashing with AHUT China
Quick flashing is a part of our human practice. This event includes JSNU-China and AHUT China. This kind of collaboration is full of energy and passion. We have made these two teams' video into one and sent it on the Internet for everybody to view. Through iGEM, this big family, we are on the road of letting more people focus on iGEM.
Cooperation with ShanghaitechChina
For this year’s competition, we assisted this team to design cartoon bacteria characters, using on their team’s wiki page. Some of the cartoon characters are shown. In response to our help, they provided us with Hela cell samples in our project that aimed at applying anthocyanin to increase KLF4’s expression in cancer therapy.
Experiment for HUST-China
We helped HUST-China from Huazhong University of Science and Technology to do the time gradient of fluorescent observation, which is about the microbial. The experiment requires us to record the green fluorescence expression in order to learn about the change of the fluorescence in different periods, in which case we can know the change of transformed E. coil BL21.
Collaboration with SJTU_software
Since this software team need abundant users' feedback and want our team to do so, we are happy to help them to test their app. All of our team members have already browsed their website and find bugs during the process.Then, we send the advice to the software team. With our advice, this team will improve their software. This kind of collaboration strongly reflects the spirit of IGEM which is helping each other and communicate together.
Thanks to Nanjing University for offering us Neuronal cells.
We also appreciate Nankai University for helping us with some problems about wiki.
