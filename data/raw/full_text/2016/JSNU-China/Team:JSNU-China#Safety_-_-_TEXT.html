Safety
Do you know what is safety?
Safety is the basis of all experiments, including the security of experimental operation, reagent and environment. Before every experiment, all instructors told us：lab workers must be very careful, We all only have one life. So we all deeply understand the importance of safety.
Have you received the professional laboratory training?
Before the experiments, we watched the video about laboratory safety considerations with instructors’ explanation. Meanwhile, laboratory safety manuals were distributed to everyone. We were not allowed to enter the lab experiment until we passed the lab safety test.
What problems did you meet in the experiment, and how did you solve them?
A freshman of our team is not clear about the maximum speed of the centrifuge, causing a great panic in the lab. Then we turned off the centrifuge immediately and pulled the plug to prevent the tragedy. Since then, we more profoundly understand of the significance of laboratory safety.
What we used in our project are all harmless and were used under well-established protocols, with proper guidance and safety equipment. The critical materials we used like anthocyanin is classified as bio-safety level 1 organisms. Moreover, the experiments are mainly in the molecular level, so the risks were caused by the reagents we used. For example, we needed to use methanol. After collecting and sterilizing, the bio- or chemical wastes would be recycled by professional chemical recycling staffs in our lab respectively.
Before our research, every member had received safety training through certain curriculum provided by our department. All of us have successfully acquired skills in waste disposal, accident prevention, fire procedures and cleanliness. During our research, we carried out experiments within the bio-safety guidelines established by WHO. Each member strictly adhered to experimental procedures with appropriate personal protective equipment, such as lab coats and lab gloves.
