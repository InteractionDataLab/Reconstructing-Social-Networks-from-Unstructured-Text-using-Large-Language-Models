Our process
To assess what social issues arise due to platinum production we asked the Pretoria iGEM team from South Africa to investigate and interview some people as the city of Pretoria is close to major platinum mining production and industrial complexes.
They interviewed a lecturer of the mining industry departement of their university and a lecturer in the political departement of the university of pretoria. They present our project to get their opinion about it.
To see the reality of platinum mining, please visit their wiki .
Many thanks to Pretoria iGEM Team to have investigate on the field for us !
