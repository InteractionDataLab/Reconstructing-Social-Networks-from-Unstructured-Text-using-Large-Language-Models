DesA in Desferrioxamine B biosynthesis patway
We have set up the BBa_K1951000 simple biobrick. We have designed this biobrick from the sequence of desA of Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2) (complete genome here ). It codes for the lysine descarboxylase DesA. It is an enzyme from the lyase family that converts lysine to cadaverine. desA is the first gene from the des operon. This operon is involved in biosynthesis of the Desferrioxamine B, a bacterial siderophore using to bind ferric ion from the environment. As this sequence comes from a gram positive bacterium (i.e., Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2)), we obtimised codon for expression in Escherichia coli by using codon optimization IDT software [1] .
We have successfully registered for iGEM and we had a great summer. We will attends the Giant Jamboree and we are ready!!!
All the deliverables have been met.
Our Attribution page is created and all the work done during this fabulous project is referenced here .
Silver medal
To compete for the silver medal, we have constructed a BBa_K1951004 functionnal composite biobrick, that works as expected. This biobrick were designed from I0500 (pARA/araC inducible promoter), B0034 (Ribosome Binding Site) and our basic biobrick K1951000 (Lysine decarboxylase DesA). To test for function, we have complemented a cadA mutant with our biobrick BBa_K1951004 , and demonstrated the recovery of cadaverine biosynthesis. Our results show even more production than obtained with the WT strain. For more information, please visit this page .
We also helped other iGEM teams:
the Bordeaux team by extracting data  from an article and analyze them.
the Toulouse team by making a model of plasmid loss.
All of this can be found here .
For our human practices, we present the iGEM competition and the use of the synthetic biology in many events .
Gold medal
To reach the gold medal, we worked hard to integrate our human practices to our project.  You can find all this work and how it helped our project right here .
We also improved an existing BioBrick, Glasgow 2014 team's BioBrick ( BBa K1463604 ), making our brick ( BBa K1951008 ). This BioBrick is an improvement of the orignial BioBrick in three ways:
The codon usage has been optimized to ensure a strong expression in E.coli,
The RBS has no mutation so the flagellin is well expressed,
Our swimming test show that the swimming phenotype of the BioBick is improved thanks to our changes.
All the functional tests and experiments, show this part is functional, are listed here .
