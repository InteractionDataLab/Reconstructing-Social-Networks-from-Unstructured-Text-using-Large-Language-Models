Our Members
Claire RAYNAUD
My staff nicknames are Clairounette or the lab machine depending of the day mood. Perhaps their inspiration came from a remnant of my youth in the Medoc countryside (may it reminds you some wines and red noses...) what has shaped me tough and an occasionally cheeky girl. If I am not on the lab, you can find me in the Calanques enjoying the roof of Marseille or travelling somewhere around the world. Though nature is my big hang-up, heaps of bacterial issues have pushed me to make a Microbiology master degree... However, my best friend is definitely my badminton racquet. I walk it everywhere around Marseille thus I don't forget that I am going to empty my iGEM pressure soon!
Louis GIVELET
Hi! I’m Louis, nicknamed Loulou among the team. I’m fond of molecular biology, biochemistry, microbiology, cellular biology, genetics…uh…well all biology stuff in fact.  I was always convinced that the living is the best source of inspiration we could ever find to solve our current issues. So when I heard about the iGEM competition during my first year of master’s degree I just couldn’t wait to go for it! Among team I’m described as the severe one even if during summer I overwhelmed all my teammates with my specialty, silly jokes…
Yoann SANTIN
Despite the fact I am from Corsica, I do not sleep a lot… Why? Because I am too busy to sharpen my knives in order to eat saucisson ! I recently started my second year of Master degree in Microbiology at Aix-Marseille Université and I hope to begin my PhD at the end of the year. My interest in synthetic biology arises from  its vast range of applications to solve real world problems and it was an amazing opportunity to be involved in iGEM within the Aix-Marseille team as I worked with people from different backgrounds. Outside the laboratory, I maintain my military past (you now understand my haircut…) making hiking and bushcraft with my best friends. Even I am sure it is wrong… people in the lab say I speak a lot, so hang on!
Tangui MESSINA
Hi there! I am Tangui. I was in my 1st year of master degree in Plant biology, Microbiology and Biotechnology at the beginning of this adventure. After a long hesitation last year, I decided to throw myself into the competition. All experiences acquired during this intership in the lab to defend our own project were one of the best experiences in my student life. It allows me to improve my skills and gave birth to a great friendship with the laboratory team. So I just have to say: Do not hesitate and just do it.
CEM KARAKUS
Hi I'm Cem, I'm currently perform a biology bachelor that is called "physiology and neurosiences". I've been an EEDF member for 6 years now (a french secular scouting movement). I'm 1m93 tall when I stand and the same when I lay I believe. Why am I participating to IGEM 2016? Because I'm fond of science. My participation as a AMU member hasn't been huge actually, I was mostly taking care of the human practices and of video footage, I would have loved participate to the lab manipulation too.
Marie-Alice MINASSIAN
Hey, I’m Marie-Alice Minassian a second year cell biology student at Aix-Marseille University. As I am the youngest in the team, I'm afraid I'll remain a 17 year old first year student to my friends for the rest of my life...
When I'm not in class annoying my professors I also enjoy annoying my friends, watching anime, heavy metal music and fighting for student rights as a member of UNEF (National Union of Students of France).
This year I decided to participate in iGEM to expand my knowledge of the scientific world. During our project my main responsibilities were at the lab and engaging with the public at large in the scope of our Human Practices program, writing sponsoring documents and texts for the wiki.
Overall iGEM was one of the most enriching experiences of my life and I am thankful that I had the chance to be a part of this amazing project.
Ndour Mame Gor
Hello, I'm NDOUR Mame Gor,I come from Spain (origin Senegalese-Algerian). I was a second year biochemistry student at Aix-Marseille-University. I made a gateway to continue in medicine in STRASBOURG. Why? Because I want to be a doctor specialized in oncology. I can't go to the end of our project (Highway to Platinium) because I have to revise the first year medical course in more than the second year.
François Morlet
Hello! I'm François, I'm a first year master's student in Computer Science (digital imaging) in Luminy in Marseille. Even if it is not my field of study, I love biology ... so it was a great joy to can participate in the Aix-Marseille team, and discover what we could do with synthetic biology! I helped for the wiki, collaborations, and human practices.  I also enjoy living in Marseille, both the city and its beautiful surroundings :)
Our Advisors
Nin Sebastien
Hi, I'm Sébastien. I'm currently in first year of master of bioinformatics, structural biochemistry and genomic. I did iGEM last year and it was a very rewarding experience. This year, I had sadly not enough time to participate in the lab, but I helped with the wiki design and the collaborations.
Marion Aruanno and Yoann Chabert
Hi ! We are Marion and Yoann, the advisor's couple. We were in the team last year and we really enjoyed this first experience! So this year we recruit the new team and we tried to help them by giving them some advices or take care of things like sponsors or other  small problems.
Valérie Prima
Hi, my name is Valérie Prima, I've been working as an engineer in James Sturgis Laboratory « Laboratoire des Systèmes macromoléculaires » in Marseille (France) since 16 years. I'm studying the photosystem of purple bacteria, using molecular biology, biochemistry and biophysic technics. I'm very proud to participate to the IGEM contest as an instructor. First because I love teaching my knowledge and second because I think it's a unique human adventure. This year the team of Marseille was very motivated, they worked very hard during all the summer to achieve the experiments. I think they gave the best and I hope they will win the gold medal.
Our Supervisors
Sandra Michel
Hi everyone ! I'm in the last year of my thesis in Microbiology in Aix-Marseille University. I participated at iGEM with the first team of AMU and I loved the experience. I like the concept of synthetic biology, the standardisation, the outstanding quality and diversity of the projects, the human experience, that's why I wanted to start again this year with the new project on the platinum !
Laureen Logger
Hi all! I'm Laureen and I'm starting the fourth year of my PhD on the type VI secretion system. It is the second time I am a supervisor of the Igem Aix-Marseille team and still an exciting adventure! I can't wait to see the other projects and discuss with you guys! See you!
Gaël Chambonnier
Hi everyone, I'm a PhD Candidate in Marseille at the LISM. When I first took part in the iGEM competition 6 years ago as a student, I didn't know that it would hooked me up that much. But it's always a great pleasure to be part of this incredible adventure where you meet great people and find great science. Now that I'm finishing my PhD, I'm looking for a postdoc position where I will continue to deal with Synbio and hopefully with iGEM!! Relax and have FUN!! #SynBio #iGEM
James Sturgis
Hi everyone, I am a Professor of Biochemistry and laboratory director in Marseille. I recently created a synthetic biology course at the university and so was very keen to help our team turn theory into practice by participating in the iGEM, and to find out how synthetic biology can change the way we use biology. When I am not teaching student or doing research, I enjoy hiking and music.
Romain Clement
Hi, my name is Romain Clément, I’m third year PhD student in Marseille (France) and I work on micro-algae. I participate to the iGEM competition to discover the biosynthetic biology world. I give my help in my competence domains to this student team that have an interesting subject on platinum recycling.
Christophe Bordi
Hi, I'm an Associate Professor of Genomics and Molecular Microbiology in Marseille. I was delighted to join the team this year. I was very happy to discover Synbio and to share my bench experience. It was great to see how students can be motivated by science.
