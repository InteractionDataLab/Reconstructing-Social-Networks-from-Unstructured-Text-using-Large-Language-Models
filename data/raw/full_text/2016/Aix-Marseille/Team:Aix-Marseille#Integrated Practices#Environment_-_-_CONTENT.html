<B>Composting</B>, a widespread practice, could also provide <B>compostate</B> to supply the treatment processes. As most of the plants have been exposed to metals pollution during their growth, all green biomass are candidate to enter the treatment processes.
</P><P>Techniques using <B>phytoremediation</B> in sewage sludge treatment are also developed.

</P><P>So a very large range of actual techniques can be used to remove pollutants. Many solutions exist and they often provide a way to clean up the environment but also a way to recycle biomass compost heap, produce energy and gas (methanization)...
All these bio-ecological solutions could be performed together and would lead to far better situations than we have today!
