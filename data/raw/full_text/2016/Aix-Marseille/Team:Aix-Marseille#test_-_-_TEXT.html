Rayd Claire
They called me the lab warrior, perhaps it comes from a remnant of my youth in the countryside what as made me an handygirl. If I am not on the lab, you can find me in the calanques enjoying the blue sky of Marseille. Even if nature is my big hang-up, bacterias are my buddies as you can see. But my best friend is definitely my badminton raquet. I walk it everywhere then i don't forget i will empty my nervosity soon!
Givelet Louis
Hi! I’m Louis, nicknamed Loulou among the team. I’m fond of molecular biology, biochemistry, microbiology, cellular biology, genetics…uh…well all biology stuff in fact.  I was always convinced that the living is the best source of inspiration we could ever find to solve our current issues. So when I heard about the iGEM competition during my first year of master’s degree I just couldn’t wait to go for it! Among team I’m described as the severe one even if during summer I overwhelmed all my teammates with my specialty, silly jokes…
Santin Yoann
Despite the fact I am from Corsica, I do not sleep a lot… Why? Because I am too busy to sharpen my knives in order to eat saucisson ! I recently started my second year of Master degree in Microbiology at Aix-Marseille Université and I hope to begin my PhD at the end of the year. My interest in synthetic biology arises from is it’s vast range of applications to solve real world problems and it was an amazing opportunity to be involved in iGEM within the Aix-Marseille team as I worked with people from different backgrounds. Outside the laboratory, I maintain my military past (you now understand my haircut…) making hiking and bushcraft with my best friends. Even I am sure it is wrong… people in the lab say I speak a lot, so hang on !
Messina Tangui
Hey i’m Tangui. I was in 1st degree of master in Plant biology, Microbiology and Biotechnology at the beginning of this adventure. After a long hesitation last year I have decided to throw myself into the competition. All experiences acquired during this intership in a lab to defend our own project was one of the best experiences in my student life. It allow us to improve my skills and it had given born to a great friendship with the laboratory team. So I just have to say: Don’t hesitate and just do it.
Karakus Cem
Hi I'm Cem, I'm an aix-marseille university student and I'm currently doing a biology bachelor which is called "physiology and neurosiences" I've been a eedf member for 6 years now ( a french secular scouting movement). I'm 1m93 tall when I'm standing and the same when I'm lying I believe. Why am I participating to IGEM 2016? Because I'm fond of science. My participation as a AMU member hasn't been huge actually, I was mostly taking care of the human practices and of video footage, I would have loved participate to the lab manipulation though
Minassian Marie-Alice
Hey, I’m Marie-Alice Minassian a second year cell biology student at Aix-Marseille University. This year I decided to participate in iGEM to expand my knowledge of the scientific world. During our project my main responsibilities were the
