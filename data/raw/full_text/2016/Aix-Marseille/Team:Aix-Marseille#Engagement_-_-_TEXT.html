Engagement
Roverway
Roverway is an international scouting event that unites thousands of scouts from all over Europe for a few days of workshops, fun and scouting each year. This year it took place in Paris.
Thanks to a member of our team who is a scout leader at EEDF we had the chance to present a workshop about methods of work at a biology lab. We talked about hygiene, working with a flame in sterile conditions, pipetting, the preparation of Lysogeny broth and etc.
We also gave them the chance to try out transferring water into tubes by themselves. It was very interesting to share skills with them.
Fête de la Science
The “Fête de la Science” is an event dedicated to science communication. It takes place every year for a week nationwide in France. This year our team participated to the local festivities at Marseille and kept a stand during three days (14, 15, 16 October) inside the historic monument, the chapel of "La Vieille Charité".
Our program included discussions and presentations about synthetic biology, the scientific approach, our iGEM project, cloning, GMOs and etc and of course accessible to all. Our presentations could be adapted to target adults, high school middle school or college students depending on their background and interests in science.
Our project was very well received, both the implications of it in the raw materials and waste economy, and the hard work we put in designing our process. Limiting the use of GMOs to industrial settings was also very appreciated by people.
Here are some pictures taken during this event. We were pretty famous!!
We even had the chance to interact with young children from elementary school. It was somewhat challenging to explain but there was nothing more rewarding than to see the astonishment and bright light in their eyes when they learned about how small bacteria really were.
Those little guys were so cute and curious!
Biotechnologies forum
The Biotechnologies forum is a forum organized by the engineering school Polytech Marseille. Each year conferences are held at the forum with the goal of widening the students’ view of the opportunities accessible to them.
At the forum we presented our poster during the two days of the forum (3rd, 4th October) and gave a presentation of an hour about the competition iGEM and our project. We were happy to see that our presentation was interesting to the students and that more than 200 students participated.
