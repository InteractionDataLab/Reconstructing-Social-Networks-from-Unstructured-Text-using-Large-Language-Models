Protocol #0 : iGEM General Protocol
Obtaining Biobricks
EITHER on IDT →
Order on IDT when the sequences are not too long (chemical synthesis).
The received biobricks are lyophilized, they must be resuspended in water (cf protocole).
OR by PCR →
When sequences are too long and costly to order on IDT, or when a sequence must be added to an existing biobrick :
Order primers
synthesize sequence by PCR (cf protocole Q5)
add the suffixes and prefixes during the synthesis « E, X » and « S, P » (E=EcoRI, X=XbaI, S=SpeI, P=PstI) and homologue sequences to plasmids
Do a SLIC (cf protocole) to insert the wanted sequence in the wanted plasmid
the Biobrick is obtained
Transform the Bacteria with the Biobrick
E/S Digestion of the Biobrick from the original plasmid and reinsertion in the E/S pre-restricted wanted plasmid.
Transform the pre-cultivated competent cells, via a thermal shock (DH5-α, TGI, BL21).
Add  an LB-agar in a petri dish and cultivate the bacteria in rich medium added with antibiotics of interest.
Test the Transformation
Run the obtained bacteria culture DNA in a PCR and  an electrophoresis gel (qualitative assessment)
Purify plasmids (by miniprep Kit) from the previously obtained positive colonies.
Do an E/P digestion verification to see if the inserted biobricks have the correct size (On only 100ng of plasmids)
Assemble two biobricks
“Digestion protocol BioBrick Assembly Kit” et “Ligation protocol BioBrick Assembly”
Do an E/S digestion on the first biobrick and an X/P on the second
Ligate the two biobricks then insert them into the plasmid
Transforming Bacteria with a new BioBrick
E/P Restriction of the biobrick and ligation into a E/P restricted plasmid
Transform the pre-cultivated competent cells, via a thermal shock (DH5-α, TGI ou BL21).
Pour an LB gel in a petri dish and cultivate the bacteria in an antibiotic rich medium
Test the Transformation
Run the obtained bacteria culture DNA in a PCR and pour an electrophoresis gel (qualitative assessment)
Purify plasmids (by miniprep Kit) from the previously obtained positive colonies.
Do an E/P digestion verification to see if the inserted biobricks have the correct size (On only 100ng of plasmids)
Send to sequencing
Repeat steps 4, 5, 6 until obtaining the wanted sequence
Protocol #1 : Preparation of competent bacteria cells
Note : Everything should be done in sterile conditions and on ice (4°C). For 100ml of competent cells
Grow a culture of bacteria in LB medium until it reaches OD600 = 0.5.
While it grows, prepare Tbf1 and Tbf2 buffers.
Centrifuge cells for 10 minutes at 3500g at 4°C
Resuspend the pellet slowly in 50mL of Tfb1 buffer.
Centrifuge 5 min at 3500g at 4°C.
Resuspend the pellet in 8 mL of Tbf2 buffer.
Incubate 15 min in ice.
Aliquot 200µL of cell suspension in sterile eppendorf tubes and conserve it at -80°C.
