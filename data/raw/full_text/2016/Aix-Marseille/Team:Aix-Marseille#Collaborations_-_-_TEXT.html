Our collaborations
Modeling for Toulouse 2016
In collaboration with the iGEM team Toulouse , we conceived a model of plasmid loss for the Toulouse team.
Data recovery Bordeaux 2016
In order to help the iGEM team Bordeaux , we extract data from the paper « Dynamics of plasmid transfer on surfaces » [1] and organize those data about their experiments on plasmids transfer. Thanks to this, the iGEM team Bordeaux can compare those results to their own computationnal results.
Here is a summary of this article.
Colaboration made by Pretoria 2016
The iGEM team Pretoria 2016 hepled us focusing on the socio-economic and political issues facing the current platinum sector, including the Marikana strikes.
