Our Team
This​ ​year​'s ​team​ ​consists​ ​of​ ​students​ ​from​ ​broad​ ​spectrum ​of​ ​STEM backgrounds.​ ​We​ ​have​ ​biology,  physic​s,​ ​chemistry​ ​and​ ​even​ ​neuroscience​ ​majors.​ ​This​ ​diversity​​ ​allowed​ ​us  to​ ​push​ ​past​ ​the​ ​limits​ ​of​ ​our​ ​knowledge​ ​and​ ​expanded​ ​our​ ​projects​ ​further​ ​this​ ​year.​ ​Old  members​ ​and​ ​new ​members​ ​came​ ​together​ ​and​ ​cohesively​ ​grew​ ​into​ ​a​ ​team​ ​that​ ​has​ ​both  individuality​ ​and​ ​co-operativity.​ ​We​ ​learned​ ​to​ ​work​ ​together,​ ​get​ ​along​ ​with​ ​each​ ​other,​ ​and​ ​had  a​ ​blast.​ ​There​ ​were​ ​moments​ ​where​ ​we​ ​cried​ ​over​ ​progress,​ ​celebrated​ ​over​ ​achievements,​ ​and  fought​ ​over​ ​results​ ​but​ ​we​ ​still​ ​pushed​ ​on​ ​and​ ​over-exerted​ ​ourselves​ ​for​ ​our​ ​next​ ​goal.​ ​Overall  this​ ​2016​ ​GSU​ ​iGEM​ ​team​ ​was​ ​a​ ​roller coaster​ ​ride​ ​that​ ​was​ ​memorable​ ​and​ ​surely​ ​cherished.

If you had to choose one meal to eat for the rest of your life what would it be?
The meal would consists of five courses. I would start with smoked pork belly bossam and tempura fried sweet potatoes. The second course would be a bowl of pho with a glass of South African red wine.  The third course would be Maine lobster rolls with a side salad and a glass of white sparkling wine. The final course would be a chocolate French silk pie with a nice Cabernet.
