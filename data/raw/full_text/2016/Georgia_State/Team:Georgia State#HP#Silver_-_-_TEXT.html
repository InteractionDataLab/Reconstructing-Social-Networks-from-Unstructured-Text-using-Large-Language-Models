In order to spread awareness in the STEM field, we were able to reach out to the younger generation. We worked with Next Generation Men, an after school program from nearby Metro Atlanta school systems, by exposing them to different career paths in the STEM field.  We also partnered with Lambert High school and went to the Maker Faire. At the Maker Faire, we were able to inform the local community on the effects and the different medicinal uses of CBDA oil. In addition, we did a survey to see how receptive the community would be to CBDAs.
