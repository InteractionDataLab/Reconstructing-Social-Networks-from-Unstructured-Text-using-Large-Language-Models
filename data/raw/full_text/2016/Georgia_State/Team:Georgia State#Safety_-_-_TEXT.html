Safety
Here at Georgia State iGEM our teammate try to uphold to the most recent precaution protocol. Our laboratory did contained Risk Group 1 organism and basic lab materials that posed minimal risks, but we did our best to keep and maintain every lab material within a closed environment. In the lab, we culture small non-infectious organism like E. coli, Pichia pastoris, and Agrobacter tumafaciens. We grow up tobacco plants for transformational purposes only and kept it in a highly secured lab. Furthermore, we autoclave all necessary items and kept a strict lab attire. We may have burned some hairs, and contaminated some broths and kept them for fun, but we tried our best to make sure  lab personnels and teammates were kept alive until the competition was completed
