The team volunteered with Lambert High School iGEM team in promoting and informing people about synthetic biology. Our team and Lambert High School’s team exchanged project ideas and we were very interested in their CRISP-Cas9 system inspired by Georgia Tech. Not only promoting one idea, but our team was able to survey about 40+ people on Cannibidiol oil. The Maker Faire allowed us to answer questions that people in our community had about science, while also educating them on CBD oil and how it's used. We were able to survey people's knowledge of CBD oil and then in turn provide more information on it as the survey takers became curious. Our team took part in several science oriented events that allowed us to share our knowledge with those who might not otherwise be exposed to such information. </P><P style="font-weight: 700; color: white"> Survey Results </P><P style="font-weight: 700; color: white"> Atlanta Science Fair.</P><P style="font-weight: 700; color: white"> We were requested to come back to ASF for 2016 due to how successful our BioBrick activity was last year.

We partner with Next Generation Men Inc., a non profit that was established by former high school students to provide underrepresented students with professional exposure, leadership development, community service and personal support. This experience allowed the students to get exposure to college and how life is working in a lab. We provided a brief tour for students of the iGem lab spaces by showing them our lab equipment and their basic usage. Students learned about iGem and what synthetic biology is.  Students got an opportunity to learn about molecular techniques. We educated students on PCR and gave them an opportunity to run PCR and conduct gel electrophoresis. Many of the students who attended were either interested in non-science majors and or undecided. Their experience in the lab allowed them to explore and ask questions about careers in science. </P><P style="font-weight: 700; color: white">Synthetic Biology Club Reached Out to Georgia State Students</P><P style="font-weight: 700; color: white"> We also had open lab days in which other college students came into our lab during the school year, and we provided them with information on how to get involved with research as an undergraduate.  </P><P style="font-weight: 700; color: white">STEM Friendly Eyes Conference</P><P style="font-weight: 700; color: white"> Students from our iGem Team participated in a conference that undergraduates, graduate students and  faculty attended.

Many of the snakes are known to not be harmless. The snake bites can cause an allergic reaction or an infection. Both are known to cause serious problems for patients. It is imperative for victims to get to the nearest emergency as soon as possible. Unfortunately, many snake bites happen during activites like, camping, hiking or woodsy areas.  For many residents who are not inside of the metropolitan area, have to get transported to facilities that are not very close in proximity. Sometimes victims may have to travel 45 minutes to an hour to get to a hospital. This can cause issues for patients receiving prompt and excellent care.

Mambalgin can provide a non-addictive opioid alternative to morphine.We know that Acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs) are involved with nociception, depression and inflammation. ASICS are activated by lowering of pH levels in the extracellular space.  We also know that ASIC1 &amp; ASIC2 are expressed in the central nervous and peripheral nervous system. (Salinas, et. al 2014) These neurons are connected to the dorsal root ganglion, which we know to bring in sensory information.  We will be partnering with the Neuroscience Institute at Georgia State using Sprague-dawley rats to test our introduction of mambalgin to the ASICs.  We will inject rats with the expressed mambalgin intra planarly and introduce thermal pain. We will be using the paw thermal stimulator to assess nociception. We will assess results by measuring paw withdrawal latency. We will have one experimental group and two control groups. Saline/vehicle will be our negative control, and our positive will be manufactured mambalgin. Our experimental group will be for our expressed mambalgin in Pichia pastoris.</P><P style="font-weight: 700; color: white">Salinas, M., Besson, T., Delettre, Q., Diochot, S., Boulakirba, S., Douguet, D., &amp; Lingueglia, E.
