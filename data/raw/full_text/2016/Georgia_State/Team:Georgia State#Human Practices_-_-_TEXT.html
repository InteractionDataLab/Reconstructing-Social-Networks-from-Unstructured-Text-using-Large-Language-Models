Interlab
PROJECT
Throughout the past year we have connected with people all over the world as well as within our immediate community. We have worked to spread awareness of STEM fields in younger generations as well as learned from the experiences of older and more widespread generations. Both of these kinds of interactions have helped shape and mold our project to what it has become today.
