Promoting iGEM in the Middle East
Throughout the duration of working on our project, we have been communicating with the iGEM 2016 Team Ain Shams-Egypt to provide feedback on ideas and collaborate as the few schools located in the Middle East. The main goal for our collaboration was to exchange ideas to increase the number of teams participating in iGEM in our region.  On October 15, 2016, we had a video-chat conversation between the two teams, and discussed how to bring iGEM closer to our communities.
After exploring different ideas, we decided to create flyers that would be distributed to high schools in the Middle East.
