Our team has come to understand that iGEM is so much more than just a synthetic biology competition. Throughout our project, we have definitely encountered many difficult challenges that built us stronger, as university students, as members of our community, and as a team. Every single member was able to experience personal development through project management, community outreach, and scientific practice. So, we would like to thank the iGEM Foundation for the amazing and truly one-of-a-kind opportunity, and everyone else who took part in our journey of seven long months.
