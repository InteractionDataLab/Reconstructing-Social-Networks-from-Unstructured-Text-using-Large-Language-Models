Device expressing the Gb3 Synthase enzyme under control of a constitutive promoter ( BBa_K2122100 )
Gb3 synthase encoding sequence under the control of a constitutive promoter and RBS. Followed by a double promoter. It is used to code for Gb3 that binds to Shiga-like toxin subunit B.
Device expressing the Gb3 Synthase enzyme under control of an arabinose inducible promoter ( BBa_K2122000 )
Gb3 synthase encoding sequence under the control of an arabinose inducible promoter and RBS. Followed by a double promoter. It is used to code for Gb3 that binds to Shiga-like toxin subunit B.
His-tagged Shiga-Like Subunit B toxin ( BBa_K2122200 )
Shiga-like toxin subunit B encoding sequence, his-tagged on both ends, under the control of an arabinose inducible promoter and RBS. Followed by a double promoter. It is used to code for Shiga-like toxin subunit B that binds to Gb3.
Moreover, we also improved the characterization of the following part in the iGEM registry.
pro_TnaA_TnaB_term ( BBa_K1867024 )
TryptophanaseA and TryptophanaseB coding sequences under control of single constitutive promoter and RBS. Followed by double terminator. Used to increase production of indole in E. coli by increasing rate of tryptophan uptake and degradation via pyruvate pathway.
