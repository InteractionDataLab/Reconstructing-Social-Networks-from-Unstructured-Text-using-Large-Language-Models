Appropriate antibiotic solutions were prepared with the following final concentrations:</P><UL><LI>Amp 50 ug/ul</LI><LI>Kan 50 ug/ul</LI><LI>Clrm 50 ug/ul</LI></UL><P>Arabinose was added to the appropriate plates and Broth media when needed to induce expression of one of the parts.</P><H3>Transformation</H3><P>Dh5 alpha competent cells were used to express our constructs.
				Transformation was done as below:</P><OL><LI>Cells were incubated with 5 ug of plasmid DNA for 30 mins on ice.</LI><LI>Heat shock was performed at 42 degrees for 45 secs.</LI><LI>Immediate incubation on ice for 2 mins.</LI><LI>Recovery in 750 ul of SOC media was performed and tubes incubated at 37 degrees for one hour.</LI><LI>100 ul of transformed cells were placed on appropriate selective plates and incubated overnight at 37 degrees.</LI></OL><H3>Inoculation</H3><P>Single colonies were picked from successfully transformed plates and suspended in 10 ml of LB-broth complemented with appropriate antibiotics and inducers where needed. Tubes were incubated at 37 degrees for 16 hours with a rotation speed of 220 rpms.</P><H3>Miniprep</H3><P>Inoculations were subsequently pelleted by centrifugation for 2 mins at maximum speed and pellet recovered. Miniprep of plasmid DNA was performed according to the QIAGEN miniprep kit.
					Briefly, pellet was first resuspended in 250 ul of P1 buffer and transferred to microcentrifuge tube. 250 ul of P2 buffer was then added and tubes inverted 4-6 times for mixing and lysis. Mix was then neutralized with 350 ul of N3 buffer and mixed. Tubes were centrifuged at 13000 rpm for 10 mins and 800 ul of supernatant then was transferred to qiaprep columns, centrifuged for 60 secs and flow through discarded. Columns were then washed with PE buffer and centrifuged for 60 secs. A dry spin was performed to get rid of residual wash buffer and DNA was eluted with 50 ul of EB buffer in a sterile micro-centrifuge tube.</P><H3>RNA Isolation</H3><P>RNA isolation was performed using the QIAGEN RNAeasy plus kit according to manufacturer’s protocol.
