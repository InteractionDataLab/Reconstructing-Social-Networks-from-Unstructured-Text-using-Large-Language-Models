PARTS
Overview
Integrating various aspects, iGEM, above all, is a struggle to turn your idea into reality. Ultimately, this implies creating the precious parts. The parts are created by joining biobricks. This year, we have used the standard assembly protocols in order to ligate the various necessary biobricks.      However, we could not achieve our vision, and this year we will be submitting two intermediate parts, and one composite part.

PARTS
1. BBa_K2163000
This is a composite part, comprising of Cyan Fluorescent Protein (CFP), HIV Aspartyl Protease Specific Cleavage Site, and Yellow Fluorescent Protein (YFP). This part functions as the core of FRET detection system. As long as the cleavage site is intact, the FRET pair is active, while cleavage of the site leads to inactivation of the FRET pair. When attached with OmpA at the C terminal, the entire system is presented on the cell surface.
2. BBa_S05365
This is one of the two submitted intermediate parts. It consists of Cyan Fluorescent Protein (CFP) and HIV Aspartyl Protease Specific Cleavage Site.
3. BBa_S05366
This is the other intermediate part. It is made up of the biobricks coding for HIV Aspartyl Protease Specific Cleavage Site and Yellow Fluorescent Protein (YFP).
