COLLABORATIONS
Sharing and collaboration are core values of iGEM. It is encouraged that you to reach out and work with other teams on difficult problems which are easier to solve together.
iGEM Peshawar:
Our team collaborated with iGEM Peshawar, a first time participant and the first team ever from Pakistan to participate in iGEM. Since they were new to iGEM, they were quite inquisitive about it and we tried to help them as much as we could by addressing their questions. We had a separate Skype meetup with their team where we discussed each other’s ideas and about the wet lab procedures, the Giant Jamboree among other things. Since they were a little late with starting their wet lab work due to late registration and late shipment of the kit, we gave them some suggestions about how to go plan different experiments of the project in order to make most out of the limited time that they have. Advised them about which assembly protocol to follow, how to attribute the work in the group etc. They were quite friendly and we also shared some light moments after the Skype meetup. Apart from the Skype session, we helped them address the issues they faced as they went ahead with the project through regular interactions via email and social media. We also helped them spread their survey and we are thankful to them to help us spread our survey too.
IIT Madras:
iGEM IIT Madras team has made a wonderful android game related to Synthetic Biology. It was a great initiative by the team and it has inspired the fellow teams to think of such cool ways to spread the Synthetic Biology concepts. The game shows ribosomes “eating” the plasmids as the game progresses, which shows that the plasmids are expressed by the Ribosomes. They asked us to play and review the game for them which can be used to make the game better and come up with better versions in the future. We suggested them to increase the difficulty level of the game and to include more such modules where the role of each part of the cell the gene expression can be explained in a simple and entertaining manner.
iGEM XMU China:
XMU China releases its own newsletters regarding the which gives a brief description about the ongoing projects of the iGEM teams across the world. The newsletter has two parts viz. Part version which consists of five main issues: introduction, collaboration, human practice, survey and discussion and a Team version. The newsletter provides a more convenient, more user-friendly and more systematic access to link all the teams. This year, 47 teams gave their inputs which were featured in the newsletter. Our team also featured in the newsletter this year. We provided them with the project idea and the team members’ description. They also helped us in spreading our survey.
