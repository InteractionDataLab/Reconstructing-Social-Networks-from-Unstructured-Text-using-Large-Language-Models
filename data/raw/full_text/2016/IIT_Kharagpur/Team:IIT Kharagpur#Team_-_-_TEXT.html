TEAM IIT KHARAGPUR
DOING HARD WORK JUST LIKE AS MA & PA TAUGHT US
Team Profile
Let’s meet the team of IGEM 2016 from IIT Kharagpur.        We are a group of 24 people of the department of Biotechnology pushing each other towards a common goal of making lives of people better by our contribution through synthetic biology.        It’s our sophomore year in IGEM. We are new to the game but we make up for it with our passion and enthusiasm..        We believe on a famous quote by Colin Powell, “A dream doesn’t become reality through magic, it takes sweat, determination and hard work.” And well, we try to put it in action as much as possible. Our group is dedicated and we don't mind burning the midnight oil or sidelining our vacations if that's what it takes.        Someday, this team of youngsters will have  a visible impact on the world. But for now, our goal is iGEM!        We have been very fortunate with our guides who have been very patient and extremely during our whole venture. It was quite interesting and a learning experience with many ups and downs which we all faced as a team and become only stronger by them.
Our Team
Starting from ideation till experiments, Rhushikesh has been the front force in the team. He believes that synthetic biology holds the key to numerous scientific discoveries. Being the team leader, he spends most of his time in Lab, exploring the plethoral world of science. Besides his scientific endeavour, he loves photography, badminton and is a great guitarist.
Rhushikesh Mr. Front charge
Having spent most of his time in the field of molecular biology, ramesh always comes to the team’s rescue. Let it be protocol optimisation or brainstorming, he always takes the call. Besides science, he loves to play hockey and believes in hard work.
Ramesh Mr. Dependable
Adarsh is someone who won’t let you down. He can handle any type of work, be it setting up a digestion, or conducting a workshop! Enthralled by the world of Neuroscience, he is someone to watch out for in the near future!
Adarsh Mr. All Rounder
Ranging from CIA agents to us lab workers, every team needs a handler. Someone who knows how to get the work done from each person. That’s where Dipasha comes in. But do not let that fool you! When it comes to biotech, she can give the most experienced of our members a run for their money.
Dipasha Miss. Handler
The most silent member of the team. Pruthvi always works in secrecy, and paradoxically, his work has major impact on our team. Being a part of all kinds of things apart from iGEM, he somehow finds a way to do it all.
Pruthvi Mr. Foo-Bar
Well now this guy can manage like nobody’s business. Having joined this year, he bought to the team what we lacked the most, a sense of business skills. Primarily focusing on the sponsorship part of work, eventually he was also enticed on the dark side of the force, that’s to say lab work!
Nishant Mr. Manager
Shaurya is that guy on the team, who will do all possible things at the last minute, but still manage to surprise you with the level of detail in it. Apart from being a part of the team, he is a hockey player to be reckoned with, famous in the campus for his skills with a hockey stick.
Shaurya Mr. Last Minute

Chetan Mr. Pillar
If anyone is responsible for handling most of the non wet lab work, the designing and the web site areas, it is Sanjay. He can handle an immense amount of responsibility without much complaint. He makes sure we all meet our deadlines each and every time, to ensure that we stay in the run for iGEM.
Sanjay Mr. Rear Guard
Jugal is our substitute for Google! We can ask him any doubts that we have, and he will always have an answer. Extremely well versed in the area of biology, he periodically keeps astounding us with the reach of his knowledge.
Jugal Mr. Knowledge Hub
There will be nothing wrong in saying her as perfectionist. She does each and every task so perfectly and nicely. Whether it’s about presenting the ppt to various institutes or doing biobricks.  She is amazed by the fact how engineering can be used to understand biology and how it can lead to new inventions. She loves to play keyboard .
Payel Miss Perfectionist
It is perfect to describe him as a monk with inner peace. He is curious and try to explore secrets of this mysterious world. He is the most balanced person in the team who remains calm in very serious situation and handles them calmly. He is always a call away whenever he is needed.

Aman Mr. Spirited
She is ready to do the work ranging from wet lab ,notebook to human practices.   She is very optimistic person,who always looks on the positive side of everything.   Always cheerful and ready for her contribution in any aspect.The charm of life sciences always fascinates her,especially genes and its applications.
Pravina Miss Diversified
The Wiki Stud!!!      This years IGEM website of IIT Kharagpur goes to her. She has handled all the web stuff.She believes that she always look towards destination, and strives to do things beyond expectations. Always motivated, she works with a fighting spirit.

Amit Mr. Creative
He is the wikipedia of biology. If you have any doubt about anything,there is no need to google ,he will always be there with a answer. Always done and dusted for the IGEM.  Although he is a member of wet -lab team but also contribute significantly to the non-wet works also.
Akhil Mr. Stud
Being a collected person, there aren’t many things that faze Bhumika, and this is the attitude that she brings to the team. This quality of hers has led to all the seniors relying on her to get something done. A believer in core biology, she likes to diversify by playing Tennis.
Bhumika Miss Steady
PROJECT INSTRUCTOR
Being courageous enough to believe in a team of inexperienced amateurs, right from our initiation, Prof. Ganguly has been the driving force of the team.  He has filled in the gaps in our knowledge and has taught us anything that we didn't know. He has been a reassuring presence to the team, and we can always rely on him to show us the correct path.

He has forged us into able weapons of mol bio!
