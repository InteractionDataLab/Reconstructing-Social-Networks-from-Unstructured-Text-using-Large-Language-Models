Department of Biotechnology, Ministry of Science and Technology: Sponsored our project under Indian Biological Engineering Competition (iBEC), a pre-iGEM competition which provides financial support to iGEM teams on the basis of potential applications of proposed work.
IIT Kharagpur: The initial fund required for registration in iGEM was provided by our institute. We are also grateful to our institute for providing us labs and the research facility.
Integrated DNA Technologies (IDT): IDT is the world's largest supplier of custom nucleic acids, serving the areas of academic research, biotechnology, clinical diagnostics, and pharmaceutical development.It provided us the primers we needed for PCR.
Interlab:
CRF: Central Research Facility is central facility of IIT Kharagpur for students to carry out their research activities. We used the Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorter (FACS) lab of CRF under the guidance of Mr. Joyjyoti to conduct our Fluorocytometry experiments.
Epifluorescence Microscope was provided by our department and Mr. Pravir guided us all throughout the experiment.
IIT Delhi: We would like to thank the IIT Delhi team, for helping with our project, by sending us biobricks over the summer.
IIT Madras: IIT Madras team helped us by sending LUDOX solution (ours had been damaged) to aid in our inter-lab measurement study. We are grateful to them for the same.
Funding and pre-wet lab work: The applications for initial funding by the institute were drafted by Jugal and Nishant. We would like to thank Prof S. Dey of our department for representing our case at the institute level and facilitating this process. The iBEC proposal was drafted primarily by Rhushikesh and reviewed by Prof Ganguly. Sanjay, Ramesh and Chetan stayed back at the institute for the entire summer and received the Kit of Parts and initiated the “accustomed-ness” process. Yogesh and Harsheel, with their iGEM 2015 experience, helped us immensely by motivatng us, organising us and giving us proper direction and guidance.
Project Design and Wet Lab Work: The frontrunners of the wet lab work were Rhushikesh and Chetan. Each step was discussed before and reviewed after it was done, within themselves and with our guide Prof. Agneyo Ganguly. Ms. Shikha and Ms. Swagata ( Research Scholars under BMB lab) deserve special thanks for showing us the road and driving on track every time we lost our way. They, along with Sriram Bharath, helped us with their experience in this field and were always there to clear any doubts related to the protocol of various experiments.
Community: Workshops and interactive sessions were conducted at various institutes by Bhumika, Payel and Sai Akhil. These were arranged by Aman Besara, our HR expert. Media articles in a national newspaper and institute magazines were articulated and conveyed by Pravina and Payel under the guidance of Jugal.
Surveys: We launched two surveys, which were made by Rhushikesh and Pruthvi under the guidance of Varshit Dusad, a fifth year student. We would like to thank all the people and iGEM teams across the world who participated in our surveys and helped us gather the data we needed for our analysis.
Wiki Creation: The style, theme and development of our iGEM wiki were responsibly handled by two of our student team members – Manvi (Web-Wizard) and Sanjay (Designing-Maestro)
Wiki Content Development: Every student member of the team chipped in for this. The content of the pages was developed by the third year undergraduate student members of the team (special mention: Bhumika, Payel, Pravina and Sai Akhil) was supervised and guided by the fourth year members. The video-making and editing was done by  Sanjay and Sai Akhil.
Special Thanks: For capturing great pictures of our team, we would like to thank Nikesh Aryan (Undergraduate Student, Department of Biotechnology, IIT Kharagpur).
