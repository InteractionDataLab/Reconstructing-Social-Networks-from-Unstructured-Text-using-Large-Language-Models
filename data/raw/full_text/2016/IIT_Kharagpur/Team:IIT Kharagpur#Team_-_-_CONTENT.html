							Let’s meet the team of IGEM 2016 from IIT Kharagpur.
							We are a group of 24 people of the department of Biotechnology pushing each other towards a common goal of making lives of people better by our contribution through synthetic biology.
							It’s our sophomore year in IGEM. We are new to the game but we make up for it with our passion and enthusiasm..
							We believe on a famous quote by Colin Powell, “A dream doesn’t become reality through magic, it takes sweat, determination and hard work.” And well, we try to put it in action as much as possible. Our group is dedicated and we don't mind burning the midnight oil or sidelining our vacations if that's what it takes.
							Someday, this team of youngsters will have  a visible impact on the world. But for now, our goal is iGEM!
							We have been very fortunate with our guides who have been very patient and extremely during our whole venture. It was quite interesting and a learning experience with many ups and downs which we all faced as a team and become only stronger by them.
