Jialin Song
I am Jialin Song, the leader of team CIEI-BJ iGEM 2016. I am interested in the process of every biological experiment and phenomena, which is why I would enter this team and start the research of tanshinone. The same as studies and researches, harmonizing a team is also the most vital task during our cooperation. Thus, I have to try my best to organize the team and take care of each team member in CIEI.
Shunzhe Ma
I am Sunny Ma, the technical support of the team J I am a high school student who has the great passionate for biology and computer programming. I started to be interested in biology when first watched bunch of movies about DNA modifying, and about crazy experiments. At that time, I started to think biology as a magical thing that can change everything. Joining the iGEM team provides me a precious chance to get a little deeper into biology. And I believe iGEM will be a beginning of my journey to explore more.
Bowen Xiao
Hello, I am Bowen Xiao. I am not found of pizza, and I prefer paperback to e-books. I wish to study neuroscience in the future. To do this, I must equip myself with biological and academic skills. I am responsible for the background part of the wiki and the questionnaire in the human practice section.
Tianai Zhang
I am Ashley Zhang, a senior high school student whose true passion lies in molecular biology. I want to major in molecular biology in the future, and engage myself into medical treatment. I am honored to be able join the CIEI-BJ team this year and be in charge of doing experiment. It’s definitely an awesome experience to work with the members of our team. iGEM offers me an amazing opportunity that I can apply what I learn into research and experiments.
Chenghao Du
Hi, I am Eric Du, a seventeen-year-old boy from Beijing Huijia private school. I love biology deeply, which is the motivation for me to continuously focus on biology study and research in my life. In this team, I am responsible for writing of the lab protocol and the results, two of essential parts of our program. iGEM is a valuable and meaningful experience to me, which  exposed me to all amazing facilities, activities and the beautiful friendship with the students and teachers around the country.
Jiatai Cui
My name is Jiatai Cui, and my English name is Andy.I am a student in Ninth grade in Dalian, it is a very beautiful city near the sea. I have joined some other competitions, the subject that I like best are Physic and Biology，because I think they are interesting. I am excited about the iGEM because this is the first time that I enter the competition about the Biology. In the team, I did my task as good as possible.
Xinning Li
I am from He Nan, the origins of ancient Chinese culture and three of the four great inventions were invented from here. I am an outgoing girl. And book is just like my friend and I am infatuated by Harry Potter. And I think watching America drama and listening music is a good way to relax at leisure. In this team, I am responsible for the human practice and introduction.
Ke Xu
Hello, I'm Lindsay Xu from Nanjing Foreign Language School. My passion towards biology formed at a very young age. At the year of 2014, I went to Tabor Academy for summer school. My research experience at Taihu Lake improved my skills and techniques. This summer, I am selected in honor to participate in iGEM. I worked side-by-side with my teammates and teachers.
Meiqi Zhao
Hi, I'm Zhao Meiqi and in charge of the lab work. As a senior from High School Affiliated to Nanjing Normal University, I'm a machine enthusiast -I love drones, robots, 3D printers, and genetically engineered machines! In the future I want to be an engineer and a bio-hacker so that I can invent proper tools for common people to pursue life science and make their own genetically engineered machines.

Haoyan Fu
Hi, I'm Haoyan Fu, and I come from Beijing, China. It's my first time to join in iGEM match. The reason why I chose to take part in the iGEM is that I am interested in biology and computer science. In this team，my duty is design and edit the wiki webpage. Through our activities, I can improve my ability, and expand my knowledge savings.
