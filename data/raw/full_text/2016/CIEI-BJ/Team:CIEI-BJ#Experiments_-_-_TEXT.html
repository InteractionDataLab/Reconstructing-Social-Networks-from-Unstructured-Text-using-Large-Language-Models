Plasmid extraction
We used Agarose Gel DNA Recovery Kit to extract the plasmid. The experiment procedure is as follow:
Add all RNase A into solution P1; store it in the 4℃ freezer.
Add ethyl alcohol absolute into Buffer PW; store it at room temperature.
Check if P2, P3 solution contains any precipitate, if so, water bath at 37℃ till the precipitate dissolves.
Add 1-5 mL of the bacteria solution into the centrifugal tube. Centrifuge for 1 minute at 10,000g, room temperature. Decant the supernatant.
Add 250 μL of P1 into the centrifugal tube. Vortex till pellet disappears.
Add 250 μL of P2, mix by inversion for 6-8 times. (Do not mix violently)
Add 350 μL of P3, mix by inversion for 6-8 times until white precipitate appears. Centrifuge at 10,000g for 10 minutes, room temperature.
Transfer the supernatant to spin column. Centrifuge for 30-60 s at 10,000 g, room temperature. Discard the flow-through.
Add 700 μLof buffer PW. Centrifuge for 30-60 s at 10,000 g, room temperature. Discard the flow-through.
Add 500 μL of buffer PW. Centrifuge for 30-60 s at 10,000g, room temperature. Discard the flow-through.
Centrifuge for an additional 2 minutes at 10,000 g, room temperature, to completely remove any residue buffer PW. Leave the lid open for a while to allow any residual ethanol to evaporate.
Transfer the spin column to a clean centrifugal tube. Add 30-100 μL buffer EB to the center of the absorption film. Leave it at room temperature for 2 minutes, then centrifuge for 2 minutes at 10,000 g, room temperature.
The solution in the centrifugal tube now contains the plasmid. Discard the spin column. Store the plasmid DNA at -20℃.
 
Gel Electrophoresis
Making the gel
Preparing the mixture
Agarose powder 1%
TAE buffer
Melt the mixture in a microwave oven.
Pour it into the gel-casting tray and insert the comb. Wait 30 minutes for the gel to solidify.
Remove the comb with care, and place the gel along with the gel-casting tray inside the electrophoresis tank.
Running gel electrophoresis
1of 1xloading buffer need to be added for every 10 μL solution. Calculate and add appropriate amount of loading buffer to increase the sample weight.
Add 1μL dye and 1μL Bromophenol blue for each sample.
※ The dye makes the strips visible under the UV light. Bromophenol blue is used for the indication of the position of each gene.
Pour 1xTAE buffer into the electrophoresis tank until the gel is immersed. Close the lid to the electrophoresis tank and connect the electrodes. Adjust running time according to the size of the DNA sample. Pay attention to the dye line to avoid running overtime.
 
Gel extraction and purification
Agarose Gel DNA Recovery Kit:
Cut the targeted DNA stripe off the gel under ultraviolet light, discard as many residues as possible. Place the gel into a clean centrifuge tube and measure its mass.
Add binding buffer PN to the tube, the volume of PN should be two times more than that of the gel. Water bath at 55℃ for 10 minutes, overturn the tube mildly and consistently during this process.
Note: If the binding buffer appears to be pink, add 10 μL 3 M NaAc pH 5.2 to the solution.
Wait till the temperature drop back to room temperature and add the solution into the absorption column CA1, leave it at room temperature for 2 minutes, centrifuge at 10,000 g for 30-60 s. Discard the liquor in the collection tube and put CA1 back into the tube.
Note: If the volume of the gel is greater than 700μL, then place it into two CA1s. Make sure all the solution is in the absorption column.
Add 700 μL Buffer PW into CA1, centrifuge at 10,000 g for 30-60 s, discard the liquor and put CA1 back into the tube.
Repeat step 4.
Centrifuge at 10,000 g for 2 minutes. Open the lid and leave it at room temperature for 2 minutes so the ethanol will volatilize.
Place the absorption column inside a clean centrifuge tube. Add 20 μL Buffer EB to the center of the absorption film. Leave it at room temperature for 2 minutes, then centrifuge at 10,000 g for 2 minutes.
The solution in the centrifuge tube now contains the DNA we need. Discard CP and store the centrifuge tube at -20℃.
