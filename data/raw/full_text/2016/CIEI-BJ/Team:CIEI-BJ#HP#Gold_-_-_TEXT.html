Human Practice (Gold)
Tsinghua July 19th, 2016
Through sharing our initial crazy ideas with the Tsinghua team, we even build up our beliefs to save human beings and the earth by using synthetic biology! We were so much imaginative that we planned to make the mosquitos extinct, and to cure HIV by synthetic biology! The Tsinghua team discussed with us about the realization of our imagination. They are possibly realized! What an exciting news! We believe that by using synthetic biology and our efforts, we can really improve human beings’ living quality!
BIT-China July 23th, 2016
Through exchange with the BIT-China team, we got a more profound understanding of genetic engineering and conduction of the whole program. We discussed with them about our ideas and division of labor, they analyzed our ideas and gave us useful suggestions. We had great difficulties in constructing our gene circuit and were not clear with the parts we need. They used their examples to show us what is a feasible gene circuit and how to construct it. We only had a raw idea at that time, they guided us on the right track of synthetic biology! 
 
BNDS-China
They suggested us to insert a GGPP gene to our gene circuit and let E.coli convert GGPP to CPP directly, and then by testing the yield of CPP to identify production of our target enzymes reversely. This is such a good idea which can help us improve our results and really show others the application of our biobricks. We also gave BNDS-China some suggestions, such as their gene circuit might need to be more complicated. This communication helped us to understand iGEM even more deeply, to check our shortcomings and improve our work in detail.
