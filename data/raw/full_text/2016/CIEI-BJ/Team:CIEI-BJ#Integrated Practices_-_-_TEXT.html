Integrated Practices
As we all know, human practices is an important part in iGEM that we need to do some research to ensure our project are well known and can be used on a large scale without risk.
For our project, we communicate with some iGEM teams to discuss the feasible and progressive of our program. While we have the experiment on our project, we do some questionnaire and presentation in order to let people have some understanding of our project. Besides, we talked to some of the Cardiovascular physicians and comprehend the profound meaning of our project and enhance our self-confidence. What’s more, we imagined the prospects of our project. Now, take a look what we do on human practice!
