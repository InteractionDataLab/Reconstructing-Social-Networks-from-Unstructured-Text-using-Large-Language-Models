Acknowledgement
We are grateful to all the students, professors and instructors who taught us the basic knowledge of synthetic biology, inspired ideas of building an excellent wiki, including Dr. Na Wang from College of Life Science in China Agricultural University, Dr. Xiaofeng Fang from Tsinghua University, competitors from 2016 iGEM Tsinghua in Tsinghua University, competitors from 2016 iGEM BIT-China in Beijing Institute of Technology, experienced students Chenyi Li and Lingyun Huang. We are also appreciated the patient guidance in making various experiments from Prof. Xiaoquan Qi and Dr. Tianyue An from Plant Industry in Chinese Academy of Science, Prof. Shan Lu and Dr. Tianjun Cao from Nanjing University. Last but not least, we want to show our gratitude to people who support us obscurely, including all of the staff members in China International Education Institute, and the advisors and participants who filled in our questionnaires and listened carefully to our presentations. Without the help from any of the people among above, never would we achieve the result we own nowadays.
