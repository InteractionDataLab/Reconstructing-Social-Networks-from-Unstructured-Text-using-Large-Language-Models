Collaboration
Tsinghua July 19th, 2016
On July 23th, we went to Tsinghua University with our questions and initial ideas to communicate with the members of Tsinghua team. They helped us solve the problems and taught us more about iGEM and genetic biology. Then we discussed the ideas and programs of the iGEM teams a few years ago. This communication helped us build up a clearer understanding of synthetic biology and iGEM.
 
BIT-China July 23th, 2016
In the middle of July, We visited the iGEM team of BIT-China. They showed us the programs they made in the past two years, shared with us the difficulties and challenges they met and the ways for them to solve the problems. They also guided us on the designing and making of wiki.
Through exchange with the seniors, we got a more profound understanding of genetic engineering, which helped us to form a more reasonable and practical project.
 
 
BNDS-China
On October 2nd，2016, some members of BNDS-China visited us  to exchange their work with ours. Both of the teams presented their ideas, experiments, and results. Through this discussion, we got to know about their amazing idea and were enlightened by some of their suggestions. Meanwhile, we also gave them some advice  and showed them some good aspects of our project. To communicate with the high-school team made us understand iGEM even more deeply, helped us to check our shortcomings and improve our results. 
 
 
Experimental Help to BNDS-China
BNDS-China aims to soften the hard water. To achieve this goal, they decided to synthesize the E. coli backbone with ciaX that enable the bacteria to absorb Ca++. Same with us, they are a first-year high school team. Due to the limitation of their high school lab, we provided them with the access of our lab at Institution of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences. We did the PCR amplification of ciaX for them and provided the reagents needed for digestion and joining of DNA, including Phusion DNA polymerase, Taq DNA polymerase, PCR purification kit, gel purification kit, plasmid extraction kit, and restriction enzyme for Xba I, Xho I, EcorI and Pst I. We provided the relevant laboratory apparatus as well. In addition, we guided them through the usage of some of the reagents and instruments and sent them some pBS1c3 parts and pGEX-KG expression vectors for them to later clone the target gene to the expression vector and construct parts.
