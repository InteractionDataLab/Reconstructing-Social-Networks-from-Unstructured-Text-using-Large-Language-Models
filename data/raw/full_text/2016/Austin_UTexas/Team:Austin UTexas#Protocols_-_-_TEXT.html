Conjugation with DAP
.
Introduction
This is the protocol for conjugating a plasmid using a DAP dependent donor strain and a targeted recipient strain.
Materials
.3 mM Diaminopimelic Acid (DAP)
DAP Auxotroph strain with a plasmid
This plasmid should have an antibiotic resistant gene, an origin of transfer and a gene of interest.
Recipient Strain
LB+DAP Plates
LB+Antibiotic Plates
The antibiotic should be the one that plasmid has a resistance to.
Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS)
Procedure
Grow up the donor and recipient strains
For the donor cells, inoculate liquid LB+antibiotic+DAP (the one that the plasmid is resistant to). Depending on the amount of liquid media used, the volume should be divided by 1000 and then multiplied by 3 in order to determine the amount of DAP used. Ex. 5 mL of media will need 15 µL of DAP.
For the recipient cells, grow them in the required liquid media and an antibiotic if needed.
Wash the donor and recipient cells
After sufficient growth, transfer 1 mL of each strain into a microcentrifuge tube.
Centrifuge the tubes at 3,000 RPM for 1 minute, for a pellet to form.
After centrifugation, decant the supernatant, add 1 mL of PBS to the tube, and resuspend the pellets by vortexing it.
Centrifuge these tubes again at 3,000 RPM for 1 minute and 30 seconds.
Decant the supernatant and resuspend the pellets with 1 mL of PBS.
Combine the cells into a microcentrifuge tube
Take an OD600 for both cell types and make a 1:1 ratio of donor and recipient cells
Combine 50 µL of each cell type at a 1:1 ratio into a microcentrifuge tube
Spin down the solution for 3 seconds in a mini centrifuge.
Plate the solutions and incubate
Transfer 100 µL of the solution onto a LB+DAP plate. Do not spread. You can make 5 different conjugations on a plate by dividing up the plate.
Incubate these plates overnight
Scrape up the growth
After incubation, scrape up the growth with an inoculating loop and resuspend the colonies in 1 mL of PBS.
Wash the solution
Spin down the microfuge tubes at 3,000 RPM for 1 minute and 30 seconds.
Decant the supernatant.
Repeat
Resuspend the mixture of cells in 1 mL of PBS
Plate the mixture of cells
Plate 50 µL of each mixture of cells on a LB+the antibiotic the plasmid is resistant to. However, this plate can't have DAP.
Make sure to plate 1 mixture per plate and spread it.
Incubate overnight
Pick the transconjugants
With a sterile loop, pick an isolated colony that appears to have been successfully conjugated.
Streak out this colony onto another plate of the same kind (LB+Antibiotic).
Incubate this plate for 24 hours.
Create a liquid culture
Pick an isolated colony with a sterile loop and inoculate it into 5 mL of LB + 5 µL of the antibiotic.
Place these tubes into a shaker incubator for 24 hours.
Freeze down the isolate
Pipette 1.6 mL of the liquid culture into a cryovial.
Add 400 µL of 100% DMSO.
Turn upside down and back a few times to mix.
Place into a -80℃ freezer for future use.
This protocol is based off of the Barrick Lab Conjugation Protocol
LB+DAP Agar Recipe
.
Introduction
This is the protocol for making LB+DAP agar plates to be used during conjugation.
Materials
LB Agar
Diaminopimelic Acid (DAP)
Sterile Petri Dishes
50 mL Falcon Tube
Procedure
Obtain a bottle of sterile, LB Agar. Heat the bottle in a microwave at half or medium power for approximately 5-8 minutes or until completely melted.
After allowing the LB agar to cool down slightly, using sterile technique, gently pour 25 mL of LB agar into the Falcon Tube.
Add 75 µL of DAP to the LB agar in the Falcon Tube.
With the lid tightly secured on the tube, gently invert the tube in order to mix the LB Agar and DAP sufficiently.
Lastly, pour the entire mixture into the plate and allow all of the plates to dry/solidify before moving or storing them.
LB Media
This is the recipe to make 1L of LB media which is a nutritionally rich medium for bacterial growth.
Procedure
Add the following compounds
10 g of Tryptone
5 g of Yeast Extract
10 g of Sodium Chloride (NaCl)
16 g of Agar (if making solid media)
Add distilled water to reach final volume of 1 L
Autoclave the solution
This recipe is from the Barrick Lab LB Protocol
5x Tea Recipe
.
Introduction
This is the protocol for making a 5x Tea solution.
Materials
4 HEB Ready to Brew Iced Tea Bags
757 mL of diH2O
10-15 Coffee Filters
.2 µm Filter
Procedure
Boiling the Water
Heat up the distilled water in the microwave until it begins to boil. This should take around 3-4 minutes, depending on the microwave. However, due to the fact that the water does not have any impurities, it will not bubble like normal water would when boiling. YOU MUST BE CAREFUL WHEN HEATING THE WATER UP BECAUSE ONCE SOMETHING TOUCHES THE WATER, SUCH AS A TEA BAG, IT WILL INSTANTLY BEGIN TO BUBBLE AND MAY CAUSE SEVERE BURNS.
Steeping the Tea
Place 4 tea bags into the boiling water to steep for 5 minutes. Be careful to not burn yourself.
First Filtration
After steeping, filter the tea through a 10-15 in order to strain out the large particulates.
Second Filtration
Pour the tea through a .2 µm filter in order to strain out smaller particulates.
Note- You might have to run the tea through more coffee filters in order for all of the solution to filter through the .2 µm filter
