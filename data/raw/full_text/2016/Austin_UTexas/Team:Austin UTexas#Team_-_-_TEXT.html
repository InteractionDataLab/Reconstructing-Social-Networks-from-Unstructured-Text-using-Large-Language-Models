INTERLAB STUDY
We are all students at UT Austin with a passion for biochemistry and kombucha. Because of these passions, we collectively strove to understand and recreate our favorite carbonated tea. We became the 'Bucha Bunch. Our team has been working tirelessly this year to bring our kombucha project together. We would not have been able to present our research without invaluable guidance from our advisors and principle investigators.
