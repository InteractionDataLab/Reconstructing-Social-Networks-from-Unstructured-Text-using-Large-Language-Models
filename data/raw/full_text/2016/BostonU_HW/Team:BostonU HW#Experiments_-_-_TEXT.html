Protocols
Your browser does not support the video tag.
The protocols for fabricating microfluidic devices with the Neptune workflow are as follows:  Specify:
1.) Come up with a microfluidic chip idea!
2.) Write the idea out in terms of Liquid Flow Relations using the provided library of microfluidic components in the form of the User Constraints File.
[**optional**] Adjust the parameters of microfluidic components the UCF to fit the needs of the experiment. This enables rapid prototyping in that if one component needs to be edited, a change in one number can adjust all instances of a component on all subsequent designs!
3.) Let Î¼ShroomMapper convert the LFR to the more descriptive microfluidic language, MINT.
Design:
[**optional**] If necessary, make any precise edits to the MINT file (similar to editing parameters on the UCF, this is a method of rapidly prototyping designs; changing one number here will change the specifications of one specific instance of the microfluidic component of the design)
1.) Let Fluigi convert the MINT to the blueprint files depicting your microfluidic chip!
Build:
1.) Specify the volume you'd like to pull/push fluids with your controlling servo-syringe pumps
2.) Specify the precision with which you'd like to pull/push fluids with your controlling servo-syringe pumps
3.) Select and map which provided combinations of servos and syringe go to the pumps on your microfluidic design
4.) Use the provided ordering list to order the parts required to build the control infrastructure
Assembly:
1.) Follow the instructions on the Assembly user interface page to assemble the control infrastructure of your microfluidic device, using a 3D printer
2.) Follow the instructions on the Assembly user interface page to assemble your microfluidic device, using a CNC mill
3.) Follow the instructions on the Assembly user interface page to connect the control infrastructure to your microfluidic device
Control:
1.) Input commands following your microfluidic experimental protocol (opening/closing valves, dispensing liquids, pulling liquids using negative pressure)
Capture and record results!
Experiments and Development
Three example experiments, two in collaboration with the MIT iGEM team with regards to culturing mammalian cells on a microfluidic device, and one covering a fictitious synthetic biologist's test case of characterizing a genetic part with how it reacts to variable levels of inducer, can be found on the on the proof page.
For more information on the development of Neptune, see the timeline page.
