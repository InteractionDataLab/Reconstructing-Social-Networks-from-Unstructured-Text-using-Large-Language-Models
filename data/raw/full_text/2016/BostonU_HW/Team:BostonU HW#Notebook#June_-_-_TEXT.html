TIMELINE: JUNE

Switched to node.js template with handlebars to make the GUI after realizing the need of a server to open up local ports and save files
Added html pages for the web-app, javascript files for the functionality, and a css file for the look of the pages
Created a mockup for the GUI for the microfluidic work flow
Decided on a structure to implement pumps using a lever arm
Created templates to display an svg file
Added functionality to the display by dynamically creating buttons to open and close valves depending on the svg file
Incorporated Ajax to connect to the serial port to connect to an arduino
Used Ajax and post requests to import files from the web-app and save them locally to use for the settings page and the svg image
Ordered parts for the pumps setup
Changed mapper code to differentiate flow from control on an LFR file
Added functionality to mapper to work with the UCF and identify which layer all elements reside in
