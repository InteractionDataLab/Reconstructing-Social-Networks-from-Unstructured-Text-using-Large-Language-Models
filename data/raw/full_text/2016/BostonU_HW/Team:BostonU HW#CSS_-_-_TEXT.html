EXPERIENCE NEPTUNE
An end to end design suite for
continuous flow microfluidic devices
GET STARTED
SPECIFY
DESIGN
BUILD
Begin by defining which inputs and outputs your microfluidic chip will have. Declare any limitations in terms of port size, channel width. Neptune will efficiently place and route the features of your chip. The mapper (MM) tool within the place and routing functionality has been made completely by the iGEM Team.
Check and visualize your device layout using the Neptune graphical user interface. Edit the design if you so desire. Establish a control sequence to move fluids through the microfluidic chip.  The interface has been made completely by the iGEM Team.
Assemble your microfluidic system. Import our design files into a 3D Printer and CNC mill to make the chip and the pump setup.  Change the setup using our parameterized designs to fit your specific needs. The design of the setup is BU iGEM work, whilst the chip manufacturing is the work of our mentors.
OUR PROJECT
Neptune is a specify, design, and build tool for the development of continuous flow microfluidics. With Neptune, users can specify microfluidic devices through a high level description of liquid flow relations. Our application will automatically place and route the design schematic of the microfluidic and, when used in conjunction with low cost and readily available CAD tools, a user can build their custom microfluidic system in-lab.
The Boston University 2016 iGem Hardware Team is encapsulating this entire workflow through a graphical user interface. Users can write files that specify the function of the microfluidic, preview and edit their microfluidic design generated by the application, use this application directly with CAD tools such as a CNC mill to fabricate their device, and physically control valves and ports on the microfluidic chip. The iGem team is also complementing this workflow by developing and releasing open source designs of our hardware, including parametric 3D print files and firmware for microcontrollers that actuate the microfluidic valves. Finally, the iGem team is also involved in the development of the place and route software that converts a high level description of liquid flow relations into a microfluidic netlist that can that be converted into a design schematic.
