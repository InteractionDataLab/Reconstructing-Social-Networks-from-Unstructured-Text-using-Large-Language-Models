They also reached among their network and beyond whenever there was a scientific question that was not in their expertise area, or for bacteria we needed.</P><P>On top of all of this they provided us with any material they could for our labs (cones, reagents, restrictions enzymes, buffers, medium prep necessary, gloves, wipes…). Dr. Peronnet even allowed us to use the nanodrop in her lab and to performed transformation with their competent DH5α for ligated DNA samples.</P><P>They were there from the beginning and have been extremely resourceful and helpful and for that we would like to thank them again and again.</P><H3 style="text-align:left;"> General Support :</H3><P>We obtained our <EM>Bacillus subtilis</EM> strains from Dr. John Helmann from the US, Dr. Mohamed Marahiel from Germany and Dr. Hugonnet Jean Emmanuel from France.

We want to thank all of our sponsors, especially the FSDIE and BMC department from UPMC and its director, Mrs. Louvet-Vallée, but also the FSIE from UPEC and Servier for their significant financial support.</P><P>We also want to thank everyone who accepted to be interviewed by us, and/or who took part in our surveys, to those who supported us on the HelloAsso page and to everyone else who helped us with our problems, especially Pr. Delmas for attending our group meetings and giving us feedback concerning our project.</P>
