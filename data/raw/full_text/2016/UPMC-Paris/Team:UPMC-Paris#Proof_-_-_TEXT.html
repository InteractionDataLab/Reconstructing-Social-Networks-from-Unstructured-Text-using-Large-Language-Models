Proof of Concept
The first part of our project was to assemble our operator and pigments. We succed in creating the five part below.
BBa_K2180002:Fructose Operator
BBa_K2180001:Zinc Operator
BBa_K2180011:Arsenic Operator
BBa_K2180003:Sucrose Operator
BBa_K2180010:Cadmium Operator
We succeed to assemble those operators described above with the LacO promotor , the blue pigment , a terminator and amplify them into E. coli (PSB1C3) to finally integrate those biobricks into B. subtilis (PBS1C)
Each of these part, are parts of a system of biosensing.
You can find more information about these parts in the link below.
Fructose Biobrick
Zinc Biobrick
Arsenic Biobrick
Sucrose Biobrick
Cadmium Biobrick
Here are the pictures of the integrated blue pigment after putting the different factors (from the Reverse-API Gallery)
