Composite Parts:
In this section we present our composite parts. Using our Basic Parts we made a regulatory system and a detection system easily editable using a couple of restriction enzymes.
➟ PFur+LacI-LVA+Terminator is used as an Iron sensitive regulatory system.
➟ PLacO+PiBlue+Terminator is used as a reporter.
It is possible to switch between operator Lac I and the other operators
➟ Combination of PFur+LacI-LVA+Terminator and PLacO+PiBlue+Terminator :
It allows us to detect the presence of iron in the bacteria.
The aim of this system is, by adding another system to it, to detect bees' infection by a specific pathogen,
Paenibacillus larvae.
