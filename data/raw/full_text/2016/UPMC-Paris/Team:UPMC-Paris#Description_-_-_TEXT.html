BBa_K2180001 : Zinc Operator - CzrA Repressor Binding Site
http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K2180001
Biobrick based on a previous biobrick made by the iGEM09_Newcastle Team (2009-10-14) :
http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K174015
We added two restriction sites: SacII before and PacI after the regulatory region in order to use it in our project.
This restriction sites allow us to replace a regulatory region with another regulatory region.
BBa_K2180002 : Fructose Operator - FruR Binding Site
http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K2180002
The sequence of the regulatory region comes from this site
We added two restriction sites: SacII before and PacI after the regulatory region in order to use it in our project.
This restriction sites allow us to replace a regulatory region with another regulatory region.
The regulatory region is composed by two FruR binding sites wich are derepressed in the presence of fructose.
BBa_K2180003 : Sucrose Operator - DegU Binding Site
http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K2180003
The sequence of the regulatory region comes from this site
We added two restriction sites SacII before and PacI after the regulatory region in order to use it in our project.
They allow us to replace a regulatory region with another regulatory region.
The regulatory region is composed by two DegU binding (one forward, one reverse) sites which are derepressed in the presence of sucrose.

BBa_K2180005 : Blue Pigment for B. subtilis
http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K2180005
Biobrick based on a previous biobrick made by the Team iGEM11_Uppsala-Sweden   (2011-09-18) :
http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K592009
This sequence is coding for a blue pigment we use in our detection system as reporter.
We had to improve the codon usage for B. subtilis.
BBa_K2180006 : Promoter PlepA + Operator LacI for B. subtilis
http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K2180006
The part is made of a previous IGEM part made by the team iGEM12_LMU-Munich   (2012-07-16) :
http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K823002
We add two LacI binding sites (Gilbert and Maxam, PNAS, 1973)
This part is made of PlepA promoter, two LacI binding sites and a RBS. There is a PacI restriction site before LacI operator binding sites and a SacII restriction site after them. They allow us to replace the LacI binding sites by other operating sequences. A SalI restriction sites is presents before the PlepA sequence and a NdeI restriction site after the RBS that may be used to insert the whole sequence. We use this part in our project to promote the pigment expression under the control of LacI.
BBa_K2180007 : Promoter PliaG + Fur binding site B. subtilis
http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K2180007
This part is based on a previous IGEM part made by the Team iGEM12_LMU-Munich  (2012-07-16) :
http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K823000
We add the Fur Box site (Baichoo and Helmann, J. Bacteriol., 2002) in order to make this promoter inactive in the absence of Iron.
This part is made of PliaG promoter, a fur (Ferric Uptake Regulator) binding site and a RBS. There is a ClaI restriction site before the Fur Box (Fur Binding Site) and a PscI restriction site after. They allows us to remplace Fur Box by another operating sequence. A BamHI restriction sites is present before the PliaG sequence and a NcoI restriction site after the RBS that may be used to insert the whole sequence. We use this part in our project to promote the LacI + LVA expression under the control of Fur. We had to check the compatibility of the promoter with the Fur Box.
BBa_K2180008 : Double terminator
http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K2180008
This part is based on a previous iGEM part made by the Team Antiquity (2003-07-17) :
http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_B0015
This is a double terminator we use in our project for the pigment production. He is made of a transcriptional terminator in forward and reverse direction. We add a PvuII restriction site before the first terminator (forward) and an AvrII restriction site after the second terminator (reverse).
BBa_K2180009 : LacI-LVA for B. subtilis
http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K2180009
The sequence is based on a previous IGEM part made by the group Antiquity (2003-01-31) coding for LacI + LVA for E. coli:
http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_C0012
This biobrick is the coding sequence of LacI protein + LVA (rapid degradation tail) wich improve the switch time and make it more sensitive.
We had to improve the codon usage for B. subtilis
BBa_K2180010 : Cadmium Operator - MntR Binding Site
http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K2180010
Biobrick based on a previous biobrick made by the iGEM09_Cornell Team (2009-08-10) :
http://partsregistry.org/Part:BBa_K285103:Design
We added two restriction sites: SacII before and PacI after the regulatory region in order to use it in our project. They allow us to replace a regulatory region with another regulatory region. This Region allow MntR to bind to DNA and repress transcription. In the presence of Cadmium transcription is derepressed because of the fixation of cadmium to MntR.
*Other metallic ions may bind to MntR.
