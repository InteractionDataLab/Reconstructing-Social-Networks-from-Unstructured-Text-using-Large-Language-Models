Igem Team Collaborations :
We performed our experiment at an open lab named “La Paillasse”. When we learned at the European Experience that The Ionis team also happened to use this lab, we were excited to start. Since the end of July, we share the same bench, exchanging protocols, advices,reagents and materials such as tips, mediums, antibiotics, cells. We helped them directly with their manipulations, nanodroping and sequencing some of their samples when they needed to and they gave us competent DH5α E. coli when we needed it the most.  When we arrived at “La Paillasse” , they were highly helpful as they showed us around, taught us different tricks for our experiments and how to use the various equipment present. We believe that exchanging ideas between our two teams, helped both going through the competition.
One of our team goals was to raise awareness about the IGEM competition and to maitain the IGEM culture as a tradition for the various universities. To do so, we invited the IONIS team in a conference at the UPMC University, for students from the Molecular and Cellular Biology Master, where we knew we would have a large audience. The objective was for students to see the diversity of projects present in the competition, but also to promote collaborations between teams. Together, we presented the competition, our individual projects and our experience with every aspect of the competition. It was a successful meeting as numerous students approached us at the end and long after the meeting.
We also participated in surveys from different IGEM teams including the Evry team (“Let's PLAy: Polylactic Acid Plastic Revolution”), Göttingen team (“B₁₂ - Another Brick in the Wall”) and Munich United team (“Enabling Factors in Biotech”). Concerning the Evry team’s survey, as it was a survey directed to the general public, we also motivated other people to fill it. We are looking forward to see the results of these surveys. We show here the badge code we received from Munich United team and the Evry team!
