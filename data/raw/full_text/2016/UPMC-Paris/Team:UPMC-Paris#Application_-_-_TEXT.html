The final aim of our project is to have bacteria which can detect different factors. The bacteria will be in different wells of a same device si;ilar to an API gallery.
This device will be easy, cheap and quick to use. Thanks to this device beekeepers and reaserchers could follow the health of the hives and eventually detect a correlation between the different factors responsible of the bees' health decline.
