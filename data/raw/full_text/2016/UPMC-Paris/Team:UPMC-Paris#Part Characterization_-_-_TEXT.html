Overview :
Some parts were used to complete our project. Some of these parts where used from the Registry, others were designed and cloned for this project. In the following section, we are presenting all parts we used and designed.
Our parts collection :
<groupparts>iGEM2016 UPMC-Paris</groupparts>
We designed a biobricks collection that can be used in B. subtilis as biosensors.
In our collection, promoters and operators can be easily changed depending on the detection requirements.
Basic parts:
Here we present LacI-LVA and PiBlue for B. subtilis a high sensitive regulator and a blue pigment, respectively.
In addition we designed different promoters/operators, based on Registred parts or using literature.
Composite parts :
Here we present our parts composed by our basic parts.
