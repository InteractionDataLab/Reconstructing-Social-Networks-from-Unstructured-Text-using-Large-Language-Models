Reason to join:
Kévin Villette
Study: Master Student at B.M.C. (Biologie moléculaire et cellulaire) in U.P.M.C.
Field of expertise: Molecular Biology
Role in the team: Fund raising, Interviews, Experiments,
Help on Wiki, T-shirts and Logo
Reason to join: Joining the team was a great opportunity to participate in this
human adventure, and it was also a chance for me to take my first step in
synthetic biology
Sofiane Safi-Stibler
Study: Master student of genetics and epigenetics in U.P.M.C.
Field of expertise: Genetic and epigenetic
Role in the team: Fund raising, Interviews, Experiments, Surveys and Translations
Reason to join:I was interested at first by the challenge of
the IGEM competition and it's international aspect.
Benjamin Bacri
Study: Master Student at B.M.C. (Biologie moléculaire et cellulaire) in
U.P.M.C.
Field of expertise: Stem Cells Biology
Role in the team: Fund raising, Interviews, Experiments,
Translations and Team's Wiki
Reason to join: I loved the idea of creating a team and
a project from scratch, and all the challenges it implies :
the project management, the administration, the funding, the manipulation.

Field of expertise: Molecular and Cellular Biology
Role in the team: Fund raising, Interviews, Experiments, Protocols and most Translations
Reason to join: I wanted to challenge myself regarding the all aspects of the project
including it's entire managent, the identification of the scientific question
and how to approach it and the experiments themselves in  the lab
Nassim Ledoux
Study: Master student of genetics in U.P.M.C.
Field of expertise: Genetics, Epigenetics and Molecular Biology
Role in the team: Fund raising, Interviews, Experiments, Protocols
Help on Wiki, Team's Banner and Translations
Reason to join: The IGEM competition is interesting because it challenges
our abilities to conceptualize a project until its completion.
Zinebe Hadji
Study: First year of the D.U.T. of biological engineering and biological biochemical analysis.
Field of expertise: Molecular Biology
Role in the team: Fund raising, Lab assistant, Surveys and Presentations
Reason to join:I was interested by the challenge of IGEM competition and mainly, I wanted to
challenge myself by integrating a team (whose member I did not know) and by working autonomously in the lab.
IGEM has given me my first opportunity to contribute to a scientific research project!
