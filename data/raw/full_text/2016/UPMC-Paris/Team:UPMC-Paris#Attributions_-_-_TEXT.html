UPMC-Paris Team Attributions :
Team members :
Brainstorming :
In short everyone
Fund raising :
HelloAsso page designed by Wilhelm and share on social networks by all members. Emails sent to tons of companies by all members with Florent leading us at first. Meetings with companies and “Interviews” for various public funding decisions with who was available (especially Florent, Wilhelm, Nassim, Benjamin and Kévin)
Recrutement :
Perwin and Djamila
Interviews :
Pretty much the ones available
Experiments :
Everyone helped on the Concept and Protocols before June. June-August was the preparation and the start of the manipulations. It was mostly done by Nassim, Wilhelm, Sofiane, Djamila, Kévin and Benjamin. September-October manipulations were mainly done by Nassim and Wilhelm. Our favorite undergrad, Zinebe, was mostly initiated by us to most techniques, but she also did the survey creation along with Sofiane.
Our logo, T shirts and banner :
Design was done mostly by Wilhelm helped by Nassim, Kevin did the project logo.
Our Wiki :
Design was done mostly by Benjamin with some tweaks from Kévin, Wilhelm, Nassim, Sofiane and Guillaume, an outsider of the team.
Translations (French to/from English) :
It was done by everyone, but Djamila, Benjamin, Wilhelm and Sofiane did most
Supervisors :
We are extremely grateful for our AMAZING supervisors without whom we wouldn’t have gotten so far! They not only helps us for the fundraising in term of sharing our HelloAsso page (a crowdfunding platform) among their colleagues and social networks, but also helped us get funds from one of our school department. They were readily available for any advice on our projects, and constantly reminded us of deadlines. They also reached among their network and beyond whenever there was a scientific question that was not in their expertise area, or for bacteria we needed.
On top of all of this they provided us with any material they could for our labs (cones, reagents, restrictions enzymes, buffers, medium prep necessary, gloves, wipes…). Dr. Peronnet even allowed us to use the nanodrop in her lab and to performed transformation with their competent DH5α for ligated DNA samples.
They were there from the beginning and have been extremely resourceful and helpful and for that we would like to thank them again and again.
General Support :
We obtained our Bacillus subtilis strains from Dr. John Helmann from the US, Dr. Mohamed Marahiel from Germany and Dr. Hugonnet Jean Emmanuel from France. The IONIS team gave us some competent E. coli DH5α , for whom we are all grateful. We want to thank all of our sponsors, especially the FSDIE and BMC department from UPMC and its director, Mrs. Louvet-Vallée, but also the FSIE from UPEC and Servier for their significant financial support.
We also want to thank everyone who accepted to be interviewed by us, and/or who took part in our surveys, to those who supported us on the HelloAsso page and to everyone else who helped us with our problems, especially Pr. Delmas for attending our group meetings and giving us feedback concerning our project.
