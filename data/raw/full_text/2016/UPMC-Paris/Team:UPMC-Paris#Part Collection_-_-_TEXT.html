Part Collection:
Our collection is made to produce a detection system adaptable at different parasites or pathogens but also as a detection system for chemicals elements (pesticides, heavy metals…).
We designed a biobricks collection that can be used in B. subtilis as biosensors.
In our collection, promoters and operators can be easily changed depending on the detection requirements.
Considering the state of research in the field of pathogens, parasites and pesticides it was not possible to design a part specific for each of those parameters.
The main point of our system is a pigment production in the presence of some elements noxious for Bees.
Future iGEM may use our parts in the future as biosensors usable for organisms having endogenous B. subtilis.
