DNA and Plasmids
Our PCR primers were synthesized by Eurofins
Our Biobricks fragments were synthesized by IDT
We use the plasmid pSB1C3 provided in the iGEM Welcome Kit for fragment and biobrick amplification
We use the plasmid pBS1C provided by Addgene (plasmid #55168) for biobrick integration in B. subtilis.
