The story that got us there is a tricky one but were really fortunate to stumble onto this gem. Not only the heads of this place lend us a place to work on a really short notice but they also reduced the renting fees due to financial issues and because they are aware of the IGEM concept and know how it can be a struggle for students to get funds. We then started working in this place that really fast became our second home.</P><P>“La Paillasse” is a non-profit multidisciplinary lab that welcome teams or start-ups working on projects ranging from creating ink from bacteria to designing cloths. They were born about 5 years ago and today represent an important network based not only in Paris but also in other cities like Lyon, Philippines, and Cork. The principle of this place is to provide a working area completely opposite from the conventional one, but still as regulated as it should be, where every single idea can bloom with a little motivation. The only possible limitation to any type of project would be your imagination. The point is to be bold and dive in your experiments.</P><P>Only to cite some of the programs and event held at “La Paillasse”, different non-profit social events are held there, in addition of a weekly open paillasse day, for anyone to come and learn more about the place, and for insiders to learn more about the projects from other groups present. If selected for the “open residence” program, one can use freely the lab with a counterpart of 5 days per month dedicated for “La Paillasse” community work and with an additional fee for the biology lab.</P><P>We had a blast working there. As mentioned above we really felt welcomed and we were autonomous which wouldn’t have been the case if we went in another lab we had the opportunity to go. We highly appreciate all the effort from everyone including the IONIS team members, “La Paillasse” team, especially Mrs. Beauvais, and our each and every one of our team members for making this happen and for realizing our project. Working at la paillasse definitely had an impact of us and showed us the future way of working where there is a wide diversity of working area and where anyone can help anyone if possible and especially when you don’t need to be extremely rich to start a project: everything start with an idea and a lab such as “La Paillasse”</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
