Achievement
Achievements :
We believe we deserve each of the following medals as we met the following requirements.
Requirements for a Bronze Medal:
✔ Register for iGEM, have a great summer, and attend the Giant Jamboree
✔ Meet all deliverables on the Requirements page  (section 3)
✔ Create a page on your team wiki with clear attribution of each aspect of your project. This page must clearly attribute work done by the students and distinguish it from work done by others, including host labs, advisors, instructors, sponsors, professional website designers, artists, and commercial services
✔ Fill up the Attributions page
✔ Document at least one new standard BioBrick Part or Device central to your project and submit this part to the iGEM Registry (submissions must adhere to the iGEM Registry guidelines).

Additional requirements for a Silver Medal:
Experimentally validate that at least one new BioBrick Part or Device of your own design and construction works as expected. Document the characterization of this part in the Main Page section of that Part’s/Device’s Registry entry. Submit this new part to the iGEM Parts Registry

✔ Collaboration:
IONIS team for Master 1 students motivation in creating a new team next year
Participated in other teams’ surveys and motivated people to do so too
✔ Human Practices
Investigation among beekeepers and researchers on the importance and utility of our project
Additional requirements for a Gold Medal:
✔ Integrated Human Practices: After discussing with beekeepers, bee researchers and from the results of surveys we designed for them, we realized our primary target which was pesticides detection may have not been the main issue affecting bees. We then redirected our project with the feedback we got from this investigation toward pathogens detections along with other factors that could indicate beehives health.
