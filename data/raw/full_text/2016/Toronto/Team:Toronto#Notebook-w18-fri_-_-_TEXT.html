(R=Row, C=Colume): RAC1: mRFP1 (faint) - There is no distinct colour present in here as there is no CPRG present (or LB for it to grow plentifully) RAC2: mCherry (faint) - There is no distinct colour present in here as there is no CPRG present (or LB for it to grow plentifully) RAC3: LacZ1+1mM CPRG -  The LacZ that is being expressed is able to cleave the yellow CPRG into a purple subtrate (as seen here). NOTE: The clear center could be due to it drying up as this is 48 hours after initial test RAC4: LacZ2+1mM CPRG -  The LacZ that is being expressed is able to cleave the yellow CPRG into a purple subtrate (as seen here) RAC5: LacZ2+1mM CPRG -  The LacZ that is being expressed is able to cleave the yellow CPRG into a purple subtrate (as seen here). NOTE: The clear center could be due to it drying up as this is 48 hours after initial test RAC6: pgolB_LacZ+1mM CPRG -  The LacZ that is being expressed is able to cleave the yellow CPRG into a purple subtrate (as seen here) RBC1: mRFP1 (faint) - There is no distinct colour present in here as there is no CPRG present (or LB for it to grow plentifully) RBC2: mCherry (faint) - There is no distinct colour present in here as there is no CPRG present (or LB for it to grow plentifully) RBC3: LacZ1+5mM CPRG -  The LacZ that is being expressed is able to cleave the yellow CPRG into a purple subtrate (as seen here). Darker than the row above (RA) due to it having more CPRG in the well. NOTE: The clear center could be due to it drying up as this is 48 hours after initial test RBC4: LacZ2+5mM CPRG -  The LacZ that is being expressed is able to cleave the yellow CPRG into a purple subtrate (as seen here). Darker than the row above (RA) due to it having more CPRG in the well. NOTE The white dots on top of the well is a thumb smudge. RBC5: LacZ2+5mM CPRG -  The LacZ that is being expressed is able to cleave the yellow CPRG into a purple subtrate (as seen here). Darker than the row above (RA) due to it having more CPRG in the well. NOTE The white dots on top of the well is a thumb smudge. RBC6: pgolB_LacZ+5mM CPRG -  The LacZ that is being expressed is able to cleave the yellow CPRG into a purple subtrate (as seen here). Darker than the row above (RA) due to it having more CPRG in the well. NOTE The white dots on top of the well is a thumb smudge. RCC1: Lb - No colour visible here as only a small amount of Lb was added. Nothing should be visible here as it can be an indication for base contamination RCC3: LacZ1 - This well is not distincty yellow or purple as no CPRG was added. The yellow-ness around the bottom of the well is due to the bacteria. RCC4: LacZ2 - This well is not distincty yellow or purple as no CPRG was added. The yellow-ness around the bottom of the well is due to the bacteria. RCC5: LacZ3 - This well is not distincty yellow or purple as no CPRG was added. The yellow-ness around the bottom of the well is due to the bacteria. RCC6: pgolB_LacZ - This well is not distincty yellow or purple as no CPRG was added. The yellow-ness around the bottom of the well is due to the bacteria. RHC3: DH10B+1mM CPRG - A CPRG negative control where only E. coli K12 DH10β was added to a solution of 1mM CPRG. This was used to keep the sample as yellow as possible though now it is a bit faint as it has begun to try up. RHC5: BL21+1mM CPRG - A CPRG positive where BL21 (is not LacZ deficient) was added to 1mM of CPRG. This was used to keep the sample as purple as possible though now it is a bit faint as it has begun to try up.
