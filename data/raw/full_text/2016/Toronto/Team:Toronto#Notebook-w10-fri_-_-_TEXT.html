Morning:
●
Made 2 x 250ml cultures of BL21 in 2x YPTG. Put in the orbital shaker at 300rpm

Afternoon:
●
Completed first day of S30 protocol (centrifugation, 3xwashes with buffer A, flash freezing with liquid nitrogen); there are now four falcon tubes with washed cells in the -80 freezer.
●
Carried out gel extraction protocol on backbone (we made sure anything above 2.5kb [i.e. RFP] was disposed of).

Note that the backbone samples were labelled from the four slices of gel extracted, going from left to right. Therefore Backbone 1 and backbone 4 refer to the leftmost and rightmost slices, respectively.

●
Transformed CCD cells using constructs ligated overnight (transformed with 2ul and 5ul samples of the ligated constructs; CjBlue was used as control to avoid red colonies):
