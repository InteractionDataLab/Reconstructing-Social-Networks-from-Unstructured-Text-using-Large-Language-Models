Monarch Miniprep Protocol Â· Benchling
Monarch Miniprep Protocol
Introduction
NEB #T1010 ( https://www.neb.com/products/t1010-monarch-plasmid-miniprep-kit ) Monarch protocol for miniprep as described by the protocol card found in its kit
Materials
Sample
95% ethanol
Nuclease Free H20 or MilliQ Water
Monoarch Miniprep Kit
Plasmid Resuspension Buffer (B1)
Plasmid Lysis Buffer (B2)
Plasmid Neutralization Buffer (B3)
Plasmid Wash Buffer 1
Plasmid Wash Buffer 2
DNA Elution Buffer
Procedure
Before you begin
- All centrifugation steps should be carried out at 16,000 x g (~13,000 RPM)
- Add 4 volumes of ethanol (>95%) to one volume of Plasmid Wash Buffer 2
CRITICAL
Only do  this if you are using the Monarch miniprep kit for the first time
- If precipitate has formed in Lysis Buffer (B2), incubate at 30-37oC, inverting periodically to dissolve
- Store Plasmid Neutralization Buffer (B3)  at 4oC after opening (store on ice or in fridge)
Protocol
Pellet 1-5ml bacterial culture by centrifugation for 30 seconds. Discard supernatent
- Recommend 1.5ml in a microcentrifuge tube
- If cells grown in 6mL liquid cultures overnight, do 1.5mL twice (discardign supernatent after first centrifuge and adding another 1.5mL into the same tube) and begin pre-warming nuclease free water (nf-H2O) at 37oC
Resuspend pellet in 200ul Plasmid Resuspension Buffer (B1)
- Vortex or pipet to ensure cells re completely resuspended.
- There should be no visible clumps
Add 200ul Plasmid Lysis Buffer (B2), gently invert tube 5-6 times and incubate at room temperature for 1 minute
- Colour should change to dark pink and solution will become transparent and viscous
CRITICAL
DO NOT VORTEX
Add 400ul of Plasmid Neutralization Buffer (B3), gently invert tube until neutralized and incubate at room temperature for 2 minutes
- Sample is neutralized when colour is uniformly yellow and precipitate forms
CRITICAL
DO NOT VORTEX
Centrifuge lysate for 2-5 minutes
Carefully transfer supernatent to spin column and centrifuge for 1 minute and discard the flow-through
Re-insert column in the collection tube and add 200ul of Plasmid Wash Buffer 1 then centrifuge for 1 minute
- Discarding flow-through is option
Add 400ul of Plasmid Wash Buffer 2 and centrifuge for  1 minute
- Recommend do a dry spin for 1 minute after this step but not absolutely necessary
Transfer column to a clean 1.5ml microfuge tube
- Use care to ensure that the tip of the column does not come into contact with the flow-through
- If any doubt, do a dry-spin
Add 30ul or more (recommend 50uL) of DNA Elution Buffer to center of matrix then wait for 1 minute and spin for 1 minute to elute DNA
- Nuclease-free water (pH 7-8.5) can be used instead of DNA Elution Buffer
- For larger size DNA (10kb or more), heating elution buffer to 50oC prior to use
