Thursday, July 28
Thursday, 7/28
Members Present: Hamed, Kat, Alex, Tam, Karim, Marc, Bohdan
LAB:
Morning:
●
Gradient PCR amplification of the pSB1C3 backbone from RFP using NEB's Phusion polymerase.  Gradient was run high-low with corresponding samples B (A-F)
●
Gradient PCR amplification of the Short TetO LacZ insert using NEB's phusion Polymerase. Gradient was run high-low with corresponding samples Z (A-F)
●
Prepped our bio-basic PCR purification kit (using anyhdrous alcohol for the wash buffer)
Afternoon:
●
Ran two gels on our gradient PCR of the pSB1C3 and on the LacZ:
Gel1.jpg
Gel on gradient PCR of Short TetO LacZ-alpha: Lane 1: p118A/GolS? Lane 2: ZA Lane 3: ZB Lane 4: 2-log ladder Lane 5: ZC Lane 6: ZD Lane 7: ZE Lane 8: ZF. Note that because ZE and ZF had less concatemerization (corresponding to samples at lower temperatures), we kept only those samples.

Gel on the gradient PCR of pSB1C3 backbone using NEB's Phusion polymerase. Lane 1: GolS/P118A?  Lane 2: BA Lane 3: BB Lane 4: 2-log ladder Lane 5: BC Lane 6: BD Lane 7: BE Lane 8: BF Note that because the strongest bands were obtained with BA and BB (highest temperatures), only those samples were kept and the respt were discarded

Table2
Nanodrop results selectively from the successfully PCR's samples. For the LacZ-alpha gradient PCR, less concatermerization was seen at lower temperatures, corresponding to rows E and F. For the bacbone, successful PCRs were at the higher temperature range, corresponding to A and to B. d1 and d2 are the gel extracted backbone. GolS and GolSP118A are both PCR products from the previous day, done using Q5 polymerse from NEB. Sample 5 is a previous amplication using Short GolS P118A. Sample 3, similarly is amplified pgolB. Both 5 and 3 were done using Thermo's Phusion.

●
Inputted the concentrations into out ligation calculator and proceeded with RE digest and heat kill. For time-efficiency, dpnI was included in the backbone digest. These are the samples we digested:
○
Insert (short TetO lacZ-alpha)
○
Backbone digested
○
Backbone undigested (identical to digested, just that the enzymes are replaced with H20)
○
Backone dpnI (this is gel extracted backbone, that has been dpnI digested O/N)
●
rSAP of the backbone digest for 30 mins followed by heat kill
●
PCR purification following the digest.

Insert-backbone digested
○
Insert-backbone undigested
○
insert-backbone dpnI
○
HisB - pCOLA plasmid
●
Ligate O/N for 16hrs

TO DO:
For the next day:
LAB TEAM:
●
Ask Kayla if her pCOLA plasmid has a Kan (Kanamycin) resistance marker, and if yes, then if she could provide us with two plates?
●
Transformation with:
○
Ligated constructs:
■
digested
■
undigested
■
dpnI
■
pCOLA
○
Kayla's pCOLA plasmid
●
Remember to transform with 5ul of product. Use CCD cells in fridge.
