Members Present: Marc, Andrea, Celine, Davesh, Karim, Kat
LAB:
Morning:
- Transformation did not work - the colony counts are not consistent across different concentrations and duplicates. As there are no controls (ie, with different batches of competent cells, or the cells plated on just LB) it is difficult to assess wether the issue is with the competency of the cells, the transformation, or the viability of the cells themselves. Therefore another attempt with controls was done for the following day.
X4 - 0.5pg.jpg
Bacterial transformation with rubidium chloride competent cells batch CCC. Transformation in duplicate w/o control. 0/5pg plated- no colonies.
X5 - 5pg.jpg
Bacterial transformation with rubidium chloride competent cells batch CCC. Transformation in duplicate w/o control. 5 pg plated - 7 colonies on one dupllicate, 3 colonies on another.
X4 - 10pg.jpg
Bacterial transformation with rubidium chloride competent cells batch CCC. Transformation in duplicate w/o control. 10 pg plated - 4 colonies on one duplicate - 12 colonies on another.
X4 - 20pg.jpg
Bacterial transformation with rubidium chloride competent cells batch CCC. Transformation in duplicate w/o control. 20pg plated - no colonies.
X4 - 50pg.jpg
Bacterial transformation with rubidium chloride competent cells batch CCC. Transformation in duplicate w/o control. 50 pg plated - no colonies.

Table 1: Set up for a comparative transformation between different batches of competent cells. CCA and CCB are the first two batches of MgCl chemically competent cells. The third batch, CCC, was made through the use of RbCl.

Gel electrophoresis of both EcoRI and PstI digested RFP plasmid, with and without DpnI. Including a 3kb ladder and miniprepped RFP.
gel 2.jpg
GEL - LANE 1: RFP plasmid digested with EcoRI and PstI. Fragments correspond to a backbone at around 2kb and insert at around 1100bp. LANE 2: RFP plasmid digested with EcoRI, PstI, and DpnI. Largest DpnI fragment can be observed at around 750bp. The insert is 130bp shorter than the full size (976 v.s. 1106[including overhangs]) due to a DpnI restriction site within it. The LANE 3: 3kb ladder. LANE 4 + 5. Miniprepped RFP (3139bp) . Nonspecific banding most likely due to supercoiling due to the circular nature of the plasmid.
