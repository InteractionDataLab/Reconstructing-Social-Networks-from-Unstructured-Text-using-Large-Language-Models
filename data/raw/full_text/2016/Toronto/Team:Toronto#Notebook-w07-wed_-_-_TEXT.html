Wednesday, 6/29
Members Present: Hamed, Kat, Cathy, Dk, Tam
LAB:
Morning:
- Made 2 bottles of 500mL of  2Ã—YTPG (for s30 pellets)
- Cultured 100mL of DH10B as part of RbCl competent cell protocol
- PCR amplification of Short Linear LacZ fragment under the following conditions: Normal (being the conditions run previously yesterday, with a shortened annealing time of 20sec), 2 step (with the annealing temperature raised to the extension temperature 72C), 7sec (wherein the extension time was reduced from 15 sec to 7 sec to account for the smaller size of the fragment), and MgCl2 (where the Mg+ concentration was boosted by 0.2uM to account for the present of EDTA)
Afternoon:
- Made rubidium chloride competent cells, stored in -80 as CCD
- Miniprep and nanodrop of previous E.glowli culture:

- Made 5x glycerol stocks of e.coli DH10B and of RFP containing DH10B. made 3x glycerol stocks of E.glowli containing E.coli.

Nanodrop results post PCR of the Short Linear LacZ fragment. No PCR purification beforehand.
- Ran a gel along with previous PCRs of the LacZ.

GEL ELECTROPHORESIS: Lane 1: Sample with increased MgCl2 concentration and annealing time at 20sec instead of 30sec. Lane 2: 2 Step PCR of LacZ, with the annealing temperature equivalent to the extension temperature. Lane 3: Regular PCR with an annealing time of 20 sec instead of 30 sec. Lane 4: 3kb ladder. Lane 5: LacZ PCR with extension time of 7 sec instead of 15 sec. Lane 6: PCR from previous day at 70.2C with an annealing time of 30 sec. Lane 7: PCR from previous day at 69.1C with an annealing time of 30sec. Lane 8: PCR from previous day with additional MgCl2 and a annealing time of 30sec.
- Appears that running a 2 step PCR might resolve the issue of our PCR insters concatemerizing.
- 5ml Overnight culture of E.glowli and the single colony from L1 plates.
- Made 10% w/w of L-arabinose solution for inducing the PBAD promoter found in E.glowli.
