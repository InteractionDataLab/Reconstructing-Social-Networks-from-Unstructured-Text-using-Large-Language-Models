Afternoon:
●
Restriction enzyme digest (EcoRI, PstI) of LacZ PCR fragment with the samples from the 2-step PCR (29/06) and from the PCR at 68.1C (sample 5)
●
Restriction enzyme digest (EcoRI, PstI, DpnI) of the old backbone (24/06) and the new PCR backbone (30/06)
●
Ligation with the following, storing at -20 afterwards):
A
1
Old bacbone - 2 step LacZ
2
Old backbone - sample 5 LacZ
3
New backbone - 2 step LacZ
4
New  backbone - sample 5 LacZ
Table3
●
Grew E.glowli to OD600 ~0.2 and then induced with arabinose, and decreased the temperature to 30C to account for the temperature sensitivity of luciferase. BIOLUMINESCENCE OBSERVED.

Administrative:
-Returned an order of ***insert herbicide name here*** that was mistakenly packaged with our L-Glutamic Acid Phosphate Salt, from Sigma Aldrich. Copy of the order transcript for the mistakenly packaged reagent can be found in the finance folder in WB403.
TO DO:
For the next week:
●
Test rubidium chloride competend cells CCD
●
Run gel on ligated (4x) and miniprepped parts.
●
Continue PCR amplifying IDT constructs.
