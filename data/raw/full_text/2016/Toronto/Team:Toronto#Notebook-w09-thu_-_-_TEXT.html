Nanodrop of our miniprepped long_GolSP118A batch 4A. Note: we accidentally dropped the 4A batch so contamination may occur, which explains lower level of DNA conc, abnormal 260/230 and 260/280 ratios.

Summary:
Our ligation attempts were unsuccessful, as all ligated constructs appeared at the same band size (~1.7kb.) In reality, the assembled constructs should be:
■
~2.9kb - L2, L4, L6
■
~2.6kb - L5, L7
■
~2.4kb - L1, L7, L8, L9
The ligated constructs may present to be just digested pSB1C3 backbone. We suspect that some form of re-ligation occurs between the digested fragments during our ligation protocol, due to the fact that we did not PCR purify the fragments following restriction enzyme digestion. This would mean that our UNS/cut ends re-liagate back onto our inserts instead of allowing our inserts to re-ligate with the backbone. The colonies that grow following transformation may contain some form of circularized backbone with the antibiotic resistance marker.
For future steps, we shall PCR purify all parts following RE digestion. Our only successful ligation (albeit at a larger than expected size, due to suspected PCR concatemer ligation) utilized PCR purified products (see previous L1 attempt).
