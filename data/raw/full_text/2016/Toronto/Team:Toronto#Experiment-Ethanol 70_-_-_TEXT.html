Ethanol 70% · Benchling
Ethanol 70%
Introduction
Ethanol is a commonly used anticeptic in the lab environment. It has the highest effective concetration at 70% compared to a stronger solution. This occurs due to alcohols ability to coagulate protein on contact. A higher concentration of ethanol inflicts a very rapid coagulation of protein in the cell wall or membrane of target organism, effectively blocking further penetration of the organism and it's subsequent neutralization. Because of this, a more diluted 70% concentration is used for optimal penetration. SAFETY PRECAUTIONS SDS (safety data sheet): Refer to the SDS sheets for all listed materials before entering the lab. Be prepared to answer any questions regarding the information on these sheets. PPE (Personal protective equipment): Proper lab attire should be worn throughout the experiment: This means that upon entering the lab you should be wearing long pants and close-toed shoes. Contact lenses should not be worn. Furthermore, a lab coat, goggles, and gloves should be worn at all times, and long hair should be tied back. HAZARDS: Highly Flamable, Irritant
Materials
Reagents
95% ethanol
Distilled water
Equipment
wash bottle
graduated cylinder
Procedure
Preparation of 200mL stock solution
Obtain a graduated cylinder with 42.1mL of dH2O (distilled water).
Obtain a graduated cylinder with 157.9 mL ethanol.
Transfer 42.1mL of dH2O into a wash bottle.
Transfer 157.9mL of ethanol into the wash bottle, minimizing any splashing of the solution.
Close the wash bottle and swirl it in circular motion to mix
