Here's a sample experiment to show you how notebook entries work.
Use tables with formulas to make a master mix calculation. Edit the number of reactions to see it in action!

Insert new days to organize your entry (and see it on the Home calendar). Use checkboxes to plan out your day:
Combine above reaction in tube
Incubate at 37°C for an hour
Run gel
Extract band and save
Link to other Benchling files by dragging them in from the file browser at the left. Or use the @-symbol to insert a link to another Benchling file.
Drag and drop an image from your desktop to view it inline and take notes about it:

Lane 1: DNA ladder Lane 2: undigested Lane 3: digested vector Lane 4: insert DNA Lane 5: ligation tube
Insert code blocks to keep your scripts right next to your notes and results.
