Morning:
- Updated transformation results:
L1.jpg
Single colony resulting from transformation with the ligated products. Single colony should be expressing the assembled plasmid with TetO-LacZ.
No colonies found following transformation with the second ligated product.
L2.jpg
E.glowli.jpg
Multiple colonies (>6) resulting from transformation with E.glowli construct from the iGEM kit. This low efficiency may be due to low DNA concentrations in the kit, low(ish) transformation efficieny of the cells and the larger size of the plasmid construct (~9kb)
Transformation with miniprepped RFP as a positive control.

Table1
Gradient PCR for the LacZ fragment. We explored alternate PCR mixes for the calculated optimal annealing temperature for our primers (70.2C). Instead of using the standard HF buffer, we used the GC buffer - both with and without the addition of DMSO. We also explored the addition of DMSO on its own. We also tried optimizing the Mg+ concentration, accounting for the effect of chelators such as EDTA (pressent in TE buffer, which all of our constructs are resuspended in) According to guidelines, we attempted to shift the Mg+ concentration higher by 0.2mM.
Afternoon:
- PCR purification of LacZ gradient PCR samples

- Running a gel for the PCR purified LacZ:
picture of a picture of a gel.jpg
Gel: The gradient PCR temperatures decrease from left to right for lanes 1-8 and 10-13. Lanes 1-8 correspond to samples 1-8. Lane 9 - 3kb ladder. Lanes 10-13 correspond to samples 9-12 (in order). Lane 14 - PCR amplified pSB1C3 backbone from the previous day. Lane 15 - Attempt of PCR amplifyin the Short Linear TetO - LacZ alpha from the previous day.
Issue resolved after consulting Christian: It appears as if our inserts are concatemerizing as we are amplifying linear inserts. What this means is that we are getting fragments with increasing numbers of LacZ adjoined to eachother. Note that the lowest band is at ~400, the next at ~800, followed by ~1600
TO DO:
For the next day:
LAB TEAM:
- Continue with RbCl competent cell protocol (remember to use the cold room)
- If PCR for today is successful, conduct PCR on all the constructs
LAB MANAGERS:
- get Kat her USB! (please and thank you)
- purchase a pair of scissors
- 3kb DNA ladder (can wait until next week; promega 3kb should be fine)
