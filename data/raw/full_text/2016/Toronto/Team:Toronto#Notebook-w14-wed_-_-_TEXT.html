Wednesday, August 17
Wednesday, 8/17
Members Present: Alex, Cathy, Zarifah, Hamed, Tam
LAB:
Morning:
●
Made LB+CAM plates
●
Grew cells to OD600 of approximately 0.5, so that a new batch of competent cells can be made
Afternoon:
●
Cleaned stationary incubator in WB407
○
Picture updates of the plates in the stationary incubator can be founder here: https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B6Z4m6vl-WRubG5lVjJGMFpVZmM&usp=sharing (Google Drive > Biomineralization > Results > Week_14 > Aug_17 > Plate-Update-Pictures)
●
Made a new batch of competent cells (CCG)
●
Transformed CCC cells using the ligated products: R, P, G, SP, SG and C.
Administrative:
●
Contacted oGEM for Genomics in the Park Skype meeting date
○
Current time slots are for Wednesday, August 24th at either noon or 1600
For the next day:
●
Pick three colonies from each plate and grow them in 5mL cultures in 50mL falcon tubes
○
R, P, G, SP and SG: pick 3 white colonies from each. Pick ONE red colony from ONLY one of them. You should have 16 falcon tubes in total for these plates (unless there are too few colonies).
○
C: pick three red colonies + one white colony. You should have 4 cultures from this plate (unless there are too few colonies).
○
Control: pick one colony (if there are any)
○
CCF: pick one colony (if there are any)
○
CCG: pick one colony (if there are any)
○
There should be 23 falcon tubes in total. Please do not do any additional controls here.
●
Make sure miniprep kit has been ordered and that we will have it in for Friday. If not, have the manager pick up a kit.
●
Transform CCG cells using the transformation efficiency kit (some of the tubes are out; please pick three that are not empty: preferrably 50pg/ul, 10pg/ul and 0.5pg/ul).
○
Make sure you are not confusing the kit with the backbone kit we just received from iGEM.
○
Please only do one control, by plating CCG on LB+Agar (no CAM). You should use ONLY two CCG tubes. Each tube contains about 120ul of cells. If you find that the volume is not enough, use whatever is in the tube; there is no need to grab additional tubes.
○
Please parafilm the plates and place them in the broken shaker.
