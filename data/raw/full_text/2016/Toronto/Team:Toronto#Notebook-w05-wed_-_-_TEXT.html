Wednesday, 6/15
fMembers Present: Kat, Hamed, Dk, Tam, Alex, Cathy, Andrea
LAB:
Morning:
- Preparing a new set of chemically competent cells (B)
- E-mailed Kayla asking for lysis protocol
- Transformation/competent cell protocol hasn't worked with competent cells batch A:
CCA - 0.5pg.jpg
0.5pg triplicates streak plated & one plated with sterile beads. No growth
CCA - 5pg.jpg
5pg triplicates streak plated & one plated with sterile beads. 4 colonies on one of the triplicates.
CCA - 10pg.jpg
10pg triplicates steak plated & one plated with sterile beads. 8 colonies on one of the triplicates.
CCA - 20pg.jpg
20pg triplicates streak plated & one plated with sterile beds. 2 colonies on one of the triplicates and 2 colonies for the plate with beads on it.
CCA - 50pg.jpg
50pg triplicates streak plated & one plated with sterile beads. 2 colonies on one of the triplicates and 4 colonies for the plate with beads on it.
Afternoon:
- Performing transformation efficiency protocol on the old and the new batch of chemically competent cells
Administrative:
- Officialized HPLC draft proposal
- Summarized GolS protein function
TO DO:
- Make LB+CAM (+agar) plates
- Miniprep
For the next day:
LAB TEAM: Perform cell lysis using sonication (follow up with Kayla)
LAB MANAGERS: Figure out liquid nitrogen safety and transfer for tomorrow (transfer bucket?)
Gmail correspondence:
- Contact Dr. Thomas O'Halloran about his entire protocol on MerR family purification: t-ohalloran@northwestern.edu
Meetings/Notes:
iGEM Bake Sale???? :D
