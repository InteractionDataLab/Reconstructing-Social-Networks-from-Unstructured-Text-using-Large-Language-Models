Week 4: June 6 2016
Monday, 6/6
Members present: Kat, Dk, Marc, Alex, Cathy, Hamed
Lab Stuff: (research, plasmid design, protocol design, troubleshooting)
Protocols to sort out:
- Antibiotic stocks (CAM)
- Media (LB [agar + liquid] - need to have clean glassware
- Competent Cells (TSS buffer)
- Transformation Efficiency Kit (basically transformation)
- Miniprep afterwards
- Nanodrop
Sorted out the -20C freezer
- only partially, the box containing LCR+Gibson+Synbiota reagents and products
Administrative: (shipment orders, inventory)
●
Participated in the annual BioZone lab cleaning from 9.30 to 12 noon
●
Updated inventory to include physical consumables - Monday, 6th June
Email Updates: (Correspondence with professors, shipping companies, etc)
Meeting Notes:
●
Meeting with Sean Caffrey

Meeting with Naveen:
Naveen's advice.jpg
Things to Do:
- Redo RBSs recalculated for 200,000 T.I.R. as target
- Design primers for LCR
- Check if IDT includes primers
- Submit plasmids to IDT (but not order yet) to make sure they are doable
- Design LCR backbone with UNS's attached along with primers (Naveen's design #3)
- Redo restriction sites with PstI instead of SpeI (including backbone extensions)
- Before submitting to IDT, ask if Naveen has the primers
