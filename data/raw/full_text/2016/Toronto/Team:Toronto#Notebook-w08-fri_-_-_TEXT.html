Friday July 8, 2016
Friday, 7/8
bMembers Present: DK, Alex, Cathy, Tam, Hamed, Kat
LAB:
Morning:
- Made S30 Wash Buffer (A):
●
450mL filter sterilized
●
550mL non-sterilized
Afternoon:
- Took photos of our cultures in the gel doc
●
only obvious successful transformations were with GolS and GolP118A(Note: there is a reddish tinge to these; may be the result of contamination)
BL21 Culture on Agar - July 8, 2016.jpg
BL21 Culture on Agar: confirmed that we are not growing yeast (to rule out contamination from shaker)
GolS transformation - July 8, 2016.jpg
CCD cells transformed with ligated Long Linear GolS (10 colonies)
GolS-P118A transformation - July 8, 2016.jpg
CCD cells transformed with ligated Long Linear GolSP118A (2 colonies)
mCherry transformation - July 8, 2016.jpg
CCD cells transformed with mCherry (0 colonies)
RFP transformation - July 8, 2016.jpg
CCD cells transformed with RFP (control)
TO DO:
For the next day:
LAB TEAM:
- do small cultures of single successful transformed colonies
- miniprep
- PCR all inserts and run a gel on them
- Make 1L of 2xYTPG
- Pick a single colony of BL21 and grow a 5mL culture over night
