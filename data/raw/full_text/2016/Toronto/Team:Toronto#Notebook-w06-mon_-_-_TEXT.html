- Ran gel electrophoresis protocol using RFP and various amounts of DNA ladder found in the fridge (3ul, 6ul, 10ul) [picture to follow]
gel 1.jpg
GEL: LANE 1: 3uL of 3kb DNA ladder. LANE 2: 6 uL of DNA ladder. LANE 3: 9uL of DNA ladder. LANE 4: Miniprepped RFP. Note nonspecific banding. LANE 5: Loading Dye (not visible)
●
Concluded that 6uL of DNA ladder should be sufficient.
Afternoon:
Meeting with Dr. Pardee & Christian Euler
