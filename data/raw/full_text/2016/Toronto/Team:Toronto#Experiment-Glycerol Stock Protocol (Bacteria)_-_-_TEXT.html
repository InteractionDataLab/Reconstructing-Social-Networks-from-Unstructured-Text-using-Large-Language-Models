Glycerol Stock Protocol (Bacteria)
Introduction
Get started by giving your protocol a name and editing this introduction.
Materials
Reagent
Glycerol
Overnight desired bacteria culture
Appropriate antibiotic
Equipment
2mL microcentrifuge tube
Sterile pipette tips
10mL Falcon tube
LB plate
Procedure
How-to
Add 500μL 40% glycerol to a 2mL microcentrifuge tube.
Add 500μL overnight culture of desired bacteria.
Transfer the glycerol stock to the -80°C freezer. (AZ: If possible, its better to flash freeze with liquid nitrogen and then put into -80 freezer)
To recover bacteria, open the tube and use a sterile pipette tip (bring the pipette tip box to the freezer, don't put the tip on in the lab and walk there) to scrape some of the frozen bacteria off the top. Transfer right there to a 10mL Falcon tube.
␥ Do not let the glycerol stock unthaw.
␥ Do not bring it back to the lab to transfer with the pipette tip – thawing the glycerol stock will decrease the efficiency of any downstream applications for the bacteria that will remain in storage after you're done.
Start an overnight culture with the appropriate antibiotic (antibiotic added in 1:1000 dilution – i.e. 10μL antibiotic in 10mL LB).
The next morning, streak onto an LB plate, and continue as necessary.
