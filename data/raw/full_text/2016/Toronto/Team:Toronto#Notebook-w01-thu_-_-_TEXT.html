Final adjustments to the RRF
●
Addition to the 5B.1 section with regards to D.Acidovorans and 5B.6 section with chemical burns and hazards from off-gases/by-products.
●
Updates on PPE (face shield) and Cryogenics - Gas Law Calculation sheet.
Budget management: pending on access to the account on UofT Medstore.
●
In search for previous year receipts - Bohdan searched the lab- receipts were not found.
Research on BACs (Bacteria Artificial Chromosomes):
●
Commercially available BACs:
Commercially-available-BACs.docx
●
General research in to protocol design (please see new Protocol)
Explore Delftibactin options:
●
In search for potential promoters on the del cluster as a possible route of increasing delftibactin production in D. acidovorans.
●
Promoter prediction programs used including Bprom, etc...
●
Scanning the potential promoters on the genome of Delftia acidovorans using Benchling.
●
Possibility of CRISPR utilization for promoters alternation in NMR collaboration with Dr. Rudraksha Dutta Majumdar (UTSC).
Explore the plasmid design for the sensing project:
