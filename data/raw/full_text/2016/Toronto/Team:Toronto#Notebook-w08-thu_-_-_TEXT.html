Thursday July 7th, 2016
Thursday, 7/7
Members Present: Karim, Marc, Kat, Caline, Bohdan, Andrea
LAB:
Morning:
●
PCR amplified:
○
Long Linear plasmid GolS
○
Long Linear plasmid GolS P118A
○
Short Linear TetO-mCherry
Note that these were done together because their extension temperatures are similar due to their similar size (~990bp)
●
Restriction enzyme digest of:
○
Long Linear plasmid GolS
○
Long Linear plasmid GolS P118A
○
Short Linear TetO-mCherry
○
O5/O2
○
72.4C Backbone
●
Ligation of:
○
Long Linear plasmid GolS
○
Long Linear plasmid GolS P118A
○
Short Linear TetO-mCherry
●
Glycerol Stocks of BL21 cultures (both LB and 2xYPTG
●
Transformation with ligated constructs.
