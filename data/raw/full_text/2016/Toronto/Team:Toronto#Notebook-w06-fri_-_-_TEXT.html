Friday, 6/24
Members Present: Hamed, Kat, Alex, Cathy, Dk, Tam
LAB:
Morning:
- Counting number of colonies in each plate for the second ccc (first batch of rubidium chloride chmically competent cells)  transformation experiment (along with cca, ccb and negative controls). Note that CCA and CCB refer to the first two batches of competent cells produced with MgCl. CCC refers to the RbCl cells.
- ccc transformation was effective (better than cca and ccb); transformation efficiency to be calculated

Afternoon:
- PCR amplification of the backbone  and _Short Linear TetO-LacZ-alpha and measuring DNA concentration for each using nanodrop:
