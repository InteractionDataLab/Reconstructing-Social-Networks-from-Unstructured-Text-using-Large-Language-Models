Friday July 15th
Friday, 7/15
Members Present: Kat, Hamed, Tam, Zarifah, Cathy, Alex
LAB:
Morning:
●
PCR amplification of
○
pSB1C3 backbone (2x one 50ul and one 20ul) labelled BB1A-20 and BB1B-50
○
Short mCherry
○
Long Linear GolS p118A
○
Long Linear GolS
○
Short Linear TetO-LacZ
●
Restriction Enzyme digest of the aforementioned PCR amplified products
●
PCR purification of the restriction enzyme digested products.
Afternoon:
●
A gel was run on PCR products:
iGEM_July_15_2016_1804
Lane 1: pSB1c3 bb 1A-20 , one band at ~2kb, faded band ~0.8kb Lane 2: pSB1C3 bb 1B-50, one band at ~2kb Lane 3: Short mCherry, single band at ~0.9kb Lane 4: NEB 2-log DNA Ladder Lane 5: Long linear GolS p118A, no bands Lane 6: Long linear GolS, two faded bands at ~1kb and ~0.6kb Lane 7: TetO-lacZ, no bands
○
Wells contained 8ul of PCR sample with 1.6ul of DNA Loading Dye
○
Well 4 was the DNA Ladder: 2-log DNA Ladder (0.1 - 10.0 kb)
○
Gel ran at 100V for 60 min
○
Visualize using GeneSnap with Transilliminator and Et/UV

BB 1,2,3,4,5 were supposed to be combined together, but instead 1,2,3,4 were combined with sample 5. Therefore we restriction enzyme digested, PCR purified & nanodropped more BB (here distinguished as "pure"):

GEL:
■
Wells contained 8ul of PCR sample with 1.6ul of DNA Loading Dye
■
Well 4 was the DNA Ladder: 2-log DNA Ladder (0.1 - 10.0 kb)
■
Gel ran at 100V for 60 min
■
Visualize using GeneSnap with Transilliminator and Et/UV
○
PCR AMPLIFICATION:
■
Please note an error was made where NEB's Phusion was used instead of ThermoFisher, this mistake could have led to the error you see here
■
Also for some reason PCR reactions were >150ul for some unknown reason
●
Ligation with samples 1-5 and with backbone.
●
Transformation with ligated samples.
Administrative:
●
Alex had discussion with P&P regarding obtaining a server from OG for the Syn Bio Network Platform
○
P&P will have an email ready for sending on Monday
TO DO:
For the next day:
LAB TEAM:
●
Check on and take pictures of transformed cells
LAB MANAGERS:
●
Autoclave:
○
More PCR tubes
○
More micro-pipette tips
○
600ml of MilliQ-water
