Miniprepped Ligations (LacZ + pCOLA)
The two types - BB digested and BB dpnI, refer to wether or not the pSB1C3 backbone was PCR amplified from RFP , or was further gel extracted and dpnI digested. pCOLA refers to the construct pieces given by Kayla as a positive control. 1/2 refers to which plate they were taken from, as two of each transformant were made. Since two colonies were selected from each plate, A + B distinguishes the two.
●
RE single digest of miniprepped lacZ ligations, as well as Kayla's pCOLA ligations
Afternoon:
●
Made more rubidium chloride competent cells (both DH10B and BL21), labelled CCE and CC Bl21, respectively
●
Ran gradient PCR on Long GolS (G 1-6) , Long GolS P118A (P 1-6), mCherry (C 1-6).
●
Ran 3x15 lane gels on RE digested lacZ constructs, pCOLA, and on PCR gradients

TO DO:
For the next day:
LAB TEAM:
●
PCR of backbone
●
PCR purification of backbone and constructs pcr amplified today - GolS, p118A, mCherry)
●
Vacufuge some of the larger constructs to an appropriate conc for digest (ask andy for advice)
●
RE digest of constructs and backbone
●
rSAP of backbone
●
PCR purification
●
Ligation O/N at 16C
LAB MANAGERS:
●
Some autoclaving would be noice
