Measured OD600 of the BL21 culture (it was 1.566 at 5 P.M.). We decided to grow them until tomorrow.
●
Made LB+Agar+CAM and LB+Agar plates
●
Did 18x5mL cultures for miniprep tomorrow (L1A, L1B, L2A, ..., L9B). They are in rm 315 shaker along with the BL21 cultures.

Alex had meeting with Dennis from OG:
○
No updates from Nathan Stubina from McEwen Mining Industries
○
Marc Fume continues interest and has informed his gold mining contacts about us
■
Alex will send follow-up soon
○
Server for the P&P synthetic biology network was denied but they may be willing to give it to us if we provide them a letter that it is an oGEM initiative instead of iGEM Toronto initiative
○
OG is still awaiting invoices from CSM for reimbursements
●
University College has given us $500
