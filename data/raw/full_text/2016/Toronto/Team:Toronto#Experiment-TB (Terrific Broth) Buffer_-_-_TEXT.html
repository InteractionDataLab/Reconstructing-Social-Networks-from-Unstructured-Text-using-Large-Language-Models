TB (Terrific Broth) Buffer
Introduction
Terrific broth (TB, not to be confused with T Broth)
Materials
12 g Bacto tryptone
24 g Bacto yeast extract
4 mL Glycerol
12.54 g of K2HPO4 (potassium phosphate dibasic)
2.32 g of KH2PO4 (potassium phosphate monobasic)
100 mL Milli-Q H2O
900 mL distilled H2O
Procedure
Potassium phosphate solution:
Prepare 100 mL of 12.54 g of K2HPO4 , 2.32 g of KH2PO4 and mili-Q H2O  in a graduated cylinder up to 100 mL.
TB
Mix tryptone, yeast extract and glycerol, and add distilled water up to 900mL.
Pour into 2 L flask (or greater)
Autoclave (liquid cycle) both the potassium phosphate solution and TB buffer.
Allow liquid to cool to less than 60 degrees Centrigrade.
Add both the potassium phosphate solution and TB buffer together.
