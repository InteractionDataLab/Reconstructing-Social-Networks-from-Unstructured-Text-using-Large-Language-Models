Members Present: Alex, Cathy, Hamed, Marc, Zarifah
LAB:
Morning:
●
Contamination was detected in all cultures which had used CCF (including negative control for transformation efficiency test)
●
RF1 and RF2 Buffers were prepared to create a new batch of competent cells
●
Previous day transformation was prepared in liquid solution for overnight growth
Afternoon:
●
Begin making RbCl competent cells (used CCC cells)
○
First measurements at 4:40 was around 0.011, around 7:30 was around 0.120
○
Streaked the 0.120 CCC cells onto the following plates:
■
2 Lb plates (keep one for later reference)
■
1 Lb+CAM (control)
■
NOTE: The Lb plates appeared unusually liquid to the extent they were 'dripping'
○
Also streaked CCF cells to make sure they not contaminated on CCF cells
■
75ul instead of 50ul was added
