Tuesday June 14, 2016
Tuesday, 6/14
Members Present: Bohdan, Hamed, Celine, Karim, Kat, Tam
LAB:
Morning:
- Made new batches of media (2x250ml Agar+LB, 1x250ml LB)
‚óè
please remember these are half recipes, so if you need to add CAM, add only half of what is stated in the protocol
- Put a new 102.5ml culture (in LB) in the autoclave room shaker (+50mL of pure LB for control: to check for contamination)
Afternoon:
- Made TSS buffer
- Made 6 plates of bacteria grown in the shaker yesterday (from E. coli sample we received from Kevin)
- Made 16 LB + CAM plates
Administrative:
- Finalized IDT orders
- Wrote HPLC draft proposal
TO DO:
- Order Syringes
- Order noise cancelling earplugs (or find some other than the one in the basement) for sonication
- Make a new batch of chemically competent cells (TSS has already been prepared)
- Grow E. coli in at least 600ml (750ml max) of 2xYT (medium has already been prepared): we will have 31L bottles autoclaved for tomorrow morning
- Look into storage and handling of liquid nitrogen, and obtaining the relevant equipment necessary
