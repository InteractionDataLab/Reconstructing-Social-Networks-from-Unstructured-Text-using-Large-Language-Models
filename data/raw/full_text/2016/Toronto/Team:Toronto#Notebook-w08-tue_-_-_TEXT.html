CCD cells transformed with miniprepped RFP. Note overgrowth that is superior to CCC cells
CCC cells transformed with miniprepped RFP. Note overgrowth.
File_001.jpeg
File_003.jpeg
CCD transformed with 50pg of RFP. 116 colonies
CCD transformed with 0.5pg of RFP. No colonies.
File_004.jpeg
File_005.jpeg
CCD transformed with 10pg of RFP. 21 colonies.
CCC cells transformed with N5 ligated construct (new backbone - sample 5 PCR LacZ) . No colonies.
File_006.jpeg
File_007.jpeg
CCC cells transformed with N2 ligated construct. This is the new PCR'd backbone with the two step PCR LacZ construct. No colonies
CCC cells transformed with O5 ligated construct. The O5 refers to the old PCR backbone with the sample 5 PCR version of the LacZ construct. 1 colony.
File_008.jpeg
File_009.jpeg
CCC cells transformed with O2 ligated construct. The O2 refers to the  old PCR backbone with the two step PCR version of the LacZ construct. 2 colonies.
Comparison of CCC and CCD transformed with RFP. Note increased growth on the CCD versus CCC plates.

CCC (left) and CCD (right) cells transformed with RFP visualized under UV light. Note the increased growth on CCD versus CCC.
●

●
Gel of PCR amplified backbone. Also included lanes with miniprepped E.glowli and L1 (first ligated construct)
iGEM - july 5 - PCRgrad-BB.jpg
GEL of gradient PCR of pSB1C3 backbone and miniprep products:Lane 1: 74.4C Lane 2: 72.4C Lane 3: 70C Lane 4: 68.1C Lane 5: 3K Ladder. Lane 6: Miniprepped L1 construct. Lane 7: Miniprepped E.glowli construct.
●
5ml overnight cultures of RFP, O5, O2 for miniprep tomorrow.
TO DO:
For the next day:
●
Miniprep of RFP, O5, O2
●
Gel of miniprepped products to ultimately determine which ligated variant is superior. This is to determine which method of PCR is superior -> two step PCR or the generic variant. Once this is determined, we can proceed with PCR amplifying the rest of our construct.
