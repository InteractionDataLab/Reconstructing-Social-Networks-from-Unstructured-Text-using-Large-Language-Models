More PCR of pSB1C3 backbone
●
Gel of PCR's backbone:
iGEM july 21 BB.jpg
PCR amplified samples of the pSB1C3 backbone. This is for future attempts of gel extraction.
Afternoon:
●
Re Digest of LacZ insert, and of backbone from the kit (linear PCR amplified already) and backbone amplified from the RFP plasmid
●
Split the digested backbone into two, and dephosphorylated half of them with rSAP.
○
Kit pSB1C3 - LacZ
○
Kit pSB1C3 (rSAP) - LacZ
○
RFP pSB1C3 - LacZ
○
RFP pSB1C3 (rSAP)- LacZ
●
