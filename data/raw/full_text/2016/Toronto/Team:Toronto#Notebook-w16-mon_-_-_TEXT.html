The NF-H2O was nanodropped to see whether we made a mistake with the blank. When nanodropping the elution (what you blanked with) against the elution, it should be as near zero as possible. The SG1-2 and SP1-2 was nanodropped prior to the gel extraction.

C1: ng/uL = 17.9 260/280 = 2.88 (High 260/280 values are not an issue. Although purity ratios and spectral profiles are important indicators of sample quality, the best indicator of DNA or RNA quality is functionality in the downstream application of interest. If the purity ratio is significantly higher than expected, it is best to review the spectral profile.) 260/230 = 0.03 (Due to its low value, this could be an indication for a co-cotamination uch as carbohydrates, residual phenols from nucleic acid extraction or guanidine from columns or even glycogens. In our case, it could indicate that the protocol was not executed in a clean/proper manner or
