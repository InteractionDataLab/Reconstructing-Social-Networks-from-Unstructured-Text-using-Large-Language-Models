Friday, July 29
Friday, 7/29
Members Present: Alex, Cathy, Zarifah, Celine, Hamed
LAB:
Morning:
●
Made 250ml of LB+agar+Cam and LB+agar+Kana and 500ml of LB liquid media
○
Disposed of the old LB liquid media (less than 150ml left in there)
○
Kayla has provided us a microcentrifuge tube of prepared Kanamycin which has been put in the pink Cam rack in the -20oC freezer in WB403
●
LB+Agar+Kana was made using 1000x diluted Kanamycin that was supplied by Kayla
○
250ml LB+Agar with 250ul of Kanamycin stock
Afternoon:
●
Transformation on the ligations from the previous day:
○
Used CCD cells (50ul) with 1.5ul of the following plasmids:
I.
BB Digested
II.
BB Undigested
III.
BB DpnI
IV.
HISR+pCOLA
○
Also created two controls:
I.
Negative
●
50ul CCD
●
1.5ul NF water
II.
Blank
●
51.5ul of NF water
○
SOC pre-warmed at 37oC, water bath at 42oC
■
NOTE OF HUMAN ERROR
●
During heat shock, BB Digested and Negative floated away therefore exposed to water bath for an extra ~15 sec (for a total heat shock of ~60 sec)
●
750ul instead of 250ul of SOC was added to BB Undigested by accident
○
The following plates were made:
I.
BB Digested on LB+Cam (two duplicates: one fresh, one old)
II.
BB Undigested on LB+Cam (two duplicates: one fresh, one old)
III.
BB DpnI on LB+Cam (two duplicates: one fresh, one old)
IV.
Negative on LB+Cam (fresh plate)
V.
Blank/NF water on LB+Cam (fresh plate)
VI.
HISR+pCOLA on LB+Kana (two duplicates)
VII.
Negative/blank on LB+Kana (nothing streaked on, just a plate sitting in incubation)
○
All plates were stored inverted in the stationary incubator in WB403 at 37oC
Administrative:
●
OG meeting with Alex, Ben and Anthony has been canceled and moved to Wednesday, August 3rd at 10am
●
Key VP21 is no longer able to open WB407, need to contact Susie
●
oGEM P&P Skype meeting:
○
Still no server, Fahim allocated tasks to each oGEM team to begin development of the Synthetic Biology Network Platform and they will be using local servers in the mean time
TO DO:
LAB TEAM:
●
Running low on CCD competent cells, need to make more
●
Miniprep and overnight culture hopefully grown cells
LAB MANAGERS:
●
Things to wash
