Friday - September 2
Tuesday, 9/6
Members Present: DK, Celine, Hamed
LAB:
Morning:
- Made a batch of LB
- Cleaned up the lab
Afternoon:
- Finally disposed of the unknown chemical waste from last year with the help of Susie
Notes:
We have only 3 spin columns in the gel extraction kit and it is unclear whether we have enough dissolution mix. We need at least 8 columns (It's $103 for the smallest NEB gel extraction kit [including tax]). [also, we have 16 miniprep columns, so if we take the 8, then we may be short for miniprep].
