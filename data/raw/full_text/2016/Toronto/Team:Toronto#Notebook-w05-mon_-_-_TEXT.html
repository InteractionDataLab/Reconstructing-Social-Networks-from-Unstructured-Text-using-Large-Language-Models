Monday June 13 2016
Monday, 6/13
Members Present: Celene, Hamed, Bohdan, Cathy, Dk, Alex, Kat, Davesh, Andrea
LAB:
Morning: LB prep + autoclaved 1.5mL microcentrifuge tubes
Afternoon:
- Carried out the iGEM transformation efficiency protocol
- 17 plates were plated with inoculating loops (three 0.5pg/uL, three 5pg/uL, three 10pg/uL, three 20pg/uL, three 50pg/uL and two negative controls using untransformed competent cells); and 5 or 6 plates were plated with glass beads (one for each concentration)
- Plates are placed in the broken shaker in WB403 for incubation at 37C
- NOTE for the future: when we want to count the colonies after the plates have been plated with cells, use glass beads instead of inoculating loops
- DH10B cell culture are placed in overnight shaker in the autoclave room
Administrative:
- Spoke to Susie regarding unknown waste, she will be combining this unknown solution with some of her solvents at a later date and dispose of it according to her judgement. The flask remains within 403, contained in a labled box, until this comes to pass.
- All remaining RRFs (Bohdan's and Celine's) have been approved and submitted to Susie.
-Formated "Order Log" found in google drive "Biomineralization" => "Inventory => "Order Log" and will be used to keep track of expenses and materials.
