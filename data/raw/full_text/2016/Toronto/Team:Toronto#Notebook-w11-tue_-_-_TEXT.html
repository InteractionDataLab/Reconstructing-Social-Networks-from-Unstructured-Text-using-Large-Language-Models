●
Dry run of the S30 sonication protocol. We tried two conditions:
○
3X10sec on/10sec off + 5 sec. (at amp 17)
○
4X 10 sec on/10sec off (amp 10)

TO DO:
For the next day:
●
Run gel on digested miniprepped samples (try digesting the kit plasmid with single and double enzymes)
●
PCR purify and 6hr DpnI digest of the gel purified backbone
●
Order more linearized backbone from iGEM
