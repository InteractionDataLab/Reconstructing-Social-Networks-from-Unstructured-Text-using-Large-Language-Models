Team Parts
 
This year, we handed in 26 high quality, well documented bio-brick parts, including all those we used in our project this year, and several brilliantly designed others forming a Protein-protein Interaction toolkit (PPI toolkit) inspired by our iGEM project within these two years.
 
Favorite Parts
PPI fluorescent reporter based on split-GFP
(BBa_K1997014)
 
 
This part is a split-GFP reporter used for PPI study. Other than the traditional N-GFP, C-GFP approach, another split method on GFP was introduced to reach better reads and higher NSR. Special designs were taken for to optimize the applicability and adaptive of such parts. Specifically, a novel designed substitution method allowed a one-step replacement of the “Replaceable” marked region to be replaced by a “Protein1-RBS-Protein2” form fragment for studying the interaction between protein1 and protein2, thus dramatically simplified the cloning process.
 
Split-HRP enzyme based PPI Detection device
(BBa_K1997011)
 
This part is a composite part containing a lac promoter, a split-HRP reporter and a double terminator designed for the usage of PPI study. Similarly, an implanted novel substitution method allowed a one-step replacement of the “Replaceable” marked region to be replaced by a “Protein 1-RBS-Protein 2” form fragment for studying the interaction between protein 1 and protein 2, thus dramatically simplified the cloning process.
