TEAM
   This year our team consists of 13 undergraduates, 2 PIs and 2 instructors. Among all those students, Yishi Lu, Yifan Zhang and Ruixuan Chen are from Southern Medical University, Yue Wang and Dongyu Fan, Qijie Xu are from Third Military Medical University, and the rest 7 students are from NUDT.
  Besides, we all come from different majors, such as Chemistry, Electronic Engineering and so on. This makes it possible for us to mix all kinds of interesting ideas with each other thus live up the project as a versatile journey of iGEM.
   We also appreciate those who have helped our team with the project work. Without their help we would not have made the project go smoothly.

Xinyuan Qiu:
   Hello there, I'm Xinyuan Qiu, the originator of the team NUDT_CHINA. Actually this is my third year in iGEM, and frankly speaking, my college life has been changed a lot due to this amazing event. It's my great honor to have all my team members with me in iGEM 2016.
   iGEM, yours to enjoy.
   
Chushu Zhu:
    My name is Chushu Zhu. I come from a beautiful city named Lishui, located in Zhejiang China. I am an undergraduate at the National University of Defense Technology, major in chemistry. The undergraduate education gave me a wide range of vision and taught me how to cooperate with others. While learning biological knowledge and technique, I also get a sense of other field at the same time. That’s why I join the team of NUDT_CHINA. Synthetic biology is so magical, and my teammates’ brilliant ideas win my great admiration as well. This project offers me a good chance to give full play to my creativity, intelligence and diligence.
   
Jiaxin Ma:
    Hello everyone! My name is Jiaxin Ma, a chemistry bug in its third year of college. I’ve been dreaming of studying biology especially synbio and cytobiology since I was in high school, and thanks to iGEM, I realized this dream of sitting in the lab and working with microorganism. In our team, my job is to carry out experiments, design wiki and direct works as well as give presentation of Human Practice. These jobs were sometimes huge challenges for a greenhand of iGEM like me, but the experience of defeating them with our team and keeping learning new things in this field have given me great happiness.
   
Dongyu Fan:
    Hi, my name is Dongyu Fan. I'm from a historical city, Xi'an, which is a subtle blend of glorious history and modern civilization. Similarly, my character also has two sides, calm and delicate, also warm and lively. The same is true of my hobbies, I have great interest in both humanities and natural sciences, which makes my way of thinking both rational and emotional. This is my first time to participate in iGEM, and it's really a long and hard way from a non-professional person to a qualified experimenter. But to be honest, I firmly believe that the process is more important than the result. In this year, I deeply enjoy the time spending with the team members and also enjoy the fun of playing biology. that is my greatest achievement!
   
Xi Cheng:
    Hello,My name is Xi Cheng,you can call me Emily.Now I am a junior student of Chemistry.I came to NUDT_CHINA iGEM group just because I was deeply attracted by its harmonious experimental atmosphere.Thanks to these days,I could get some points about experiments arrangement as well as biology.Mainly,I have done some assistant experiments and project like cost estimation,interview with doctors,and etc. Now I am a junior student of chemistry, because I am longing for the harmonious atmosphere of the Igem group to come to this group. In the first half of the year, with the sense of laboratory safety awareness and the progress of the experiment, to learn a lot of. In the experiment, some assistant experiments were done, and the HP was responsible for the project cost estimation and the interview with the doctor.
   
Huifang Wang:
    Hi,everyone. My name is Huifang Wang,a member of NUDT_CHINA. In our project, I have a hand in experimental section and cost statistics. It’s an honor for me to cooperate with other members. Thank  iGEM for the platform they offer, which makes me get acquainted with the most impressive young men and give me more exposure to the international environment. Integral consciousness, time perspective and friendship is valuable spiritual wealth I gain among this project.
   
Yuanhao Mao:
    Hello, I am Yuanhao Mao, the chief member of modeling in this project. I am really crazy about mathematical modeling, theoretical analysis and, by the way, major in Optics and Photonics, which seems having nothing to do with biology. I turned a biological behavior into a simple math problem in our project and also designed a program to figure it out in a numerical solution. I am good at abstracting a practical problem in order to solve them into a calculative or mathematical way. I believe physical models and mathematical theories will make a profound influence in iGEM and, even in Biology, in the future!
   
Ruixuan Chen:
    Hi, friends! I’m Ruixuan Chen. In NUDT_China team, I was a member of the HP group. Thank goodness! I could be with you! You are my best partners in the world. I love my team, just as I like POI.
   
Qijie Xu:
    Hi, I’m Qijie Xu. As you see, I am a little plump, the fat on me makes me hate sport. Though I hate these fat, it seems that there is no use to hate them. But for The first time I know iGEM, I know I would be interested in it. As a new in iGEM, it is really a honor for me to join the team of NUDT_CHINA. In our team, I mainly work for Human Practice. By playing too many games, I have my special opinion in games. Because of this, I take part in designing the game. I always believe that the most important thing is not the result, but enjoying the process. Joining this team must be one of the best choices in my life.
   
Yishi Lu:
    Hi, my name is Yishi Lu, one of team members in NUDT_CHINA. As a biology hobbyist, I have been tired of Math, politics and physics. So, iGEM is a paradise for me. I can not only learn more about biology theoretically but also stay up late in lab with teammates. Though there are lots of mistakes, we will not give up, as failure is the mother of success. We have learnt a lot from our faults. That may foreshadow a bright future. Love life, love iGEM!
   
Yue Wang:
    My name is Yue Wang. I am a junior and my specialty is chemistry. My  hometown is a historical and humanistic city ,which lead me becoming a kind person caring people. Out of favor of biology ,I joined this team, after joining a few months ‘experiment and activity about human practice ,not only have I learned lots of knowledge ,but also build my ability .no matter what can we get ,I will always remember this unforgettable experience.
   
Yifan Zhang:
    Hello, I am Yifan Zhang, a member of the HP group. Though I am major in medine, I am really interested in computer science. Welcome to play our game, because I am one of the authors ^_^ Thanks to my partners, I finished it on time. Come on and enjoy it!
   
Yufei Xu:
    Hi, I'm Yufei Xu, a member of team NUDT_CHINA. My attention focused on the part of experiment. I had to say, the processes of biology experiment are so complex that several times I just wanted to give up. But I can't resist the temptation of biology and the felling of finally finishing the experiment.And more, I want to do something for human by myself. So, I'm here for iGEM. I know that we will meet with success.
