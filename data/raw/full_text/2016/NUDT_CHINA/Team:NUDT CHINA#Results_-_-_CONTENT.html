amplify the initial let-7a input signal, a miRNA initiated rolling circle
amplification (RCA) reaction was designed to be performed. Thus requires a
functional dumbbell shaped probe for the initial interaction with target
miRNAs. For such matters, four dumbbell shaped probes were designed, prepared
and then tested as the first steps of our project. To prepare the functional
probes, 5’ phosphate oligo DNAs were synthesized by company (Takara), after
rehydrated in DEPC-treated water, oligo DNAs were then processed by T4 DNA
Ligase to transform the linearized structure into a sealed one. The remaining un-sealed
ssDNA and dsDNA were then digested by Exonuclease I and III, thus the sealed
and dumbbell shaped probes could be purified (Figure 1A). The ligated and purified
product were then verified through 2% agarose gel electrophoresis (Figure 1B).  The
results showed that Exonuclease treated groups remained strong probe signals
similar to Exonuclease untreated ones after ligation. As control, the groups
without T4 DNA ligase treatment after exposed to Exonuclease present no DNA
signal. Thus indicated a high ligation efficiency of T4 DNA ligase treatment
and effective purification capacity of Exonuclease treatment for dumbbell probe
formation. Meanwhile, we could conclude that relatively pure dumbbell shaped
probes were obtained. Those probes were then implemented into a 2-hour RCA
reactions initiated by 10nM let-7a miRNA obtained from</SPAN><I><SPAN style="line-height:2;font-family:Perpetua;font-size:18px;"> in vitro</SPAN></I><SPAN style="line-height:2;font-family:Perpetua;font-size:18px;"> expression (Figure 1C). The result of RCA reaction was
then demonstrated through a 0.7% agarose gel electrophoresis (Figure 1D). As is
shown in the electrophoresis, RCA productions generated by a 2-hour reaction
were too large to move through the agarose gel, which then, shown as being
clogged in the well. Gel results also showed that prob1, prob3 and prob4 were
all functional for the RCA reaction, among which, prob1 showed the strongest
ability for such reaction. Prob1 was then selected as the probe in the further
experiment.</SPAN></P><P><SPAN style="line-height:2;font-family:Perpetua;font-size:18px;"> </SPAN></P><P><B><SPAN style="line-height:2;font-family:Perpetua;font-size:18px;">Figure 1.

sensitivity and specificity</SPAN></SPAN></H3><P><SPAN style="line-height:2;font-family:Perpetua;font-size:18px;">For
the primary verification and assessment of the sensitivity and specificity of
the miRNA initiated RCA reaction, let-7a, as the target miRNA was DISSOLVED IN
DEPC-TREATED WATER for various concentrations to determine the sensitivity of
RCA reaction (Figure 2A). The specificity of RCA reaction was assessed through four
different miRNAs in let-7 family, namely let-7c (one base mismatch against
let-7a), let-7f (one base mismatch), and let-7g (two bases mismatches), and fluorescent
dye Sybr I was used to monitor the amount of the dsDNA in the reaction solution.
Sybr I can bind specifically with the dsDNA and produce 515nm fluorescent when
excited by 485nm light once bound. Thus made the real-time detection of dsDNA
concentration in reaction solution possible. Building on this, real-time
fluorescent assay was performed to monitor the reaction process under different
input concentration of let-7a to determine the best reaction time (Figure 2B). Results
showed that under 120-min treatment, significant difference can be shown among
10nM, 100pM, 1pM and 10fM of let-7a while the lowest Fluorescent Intensity Variation
(</SPAN><SPAN style="line-height:2;font-family:Perpetua;font-size:18px;">Δ</SPAN><SPAN style="line-height:2;font-family:Perpetua;font-size:18px;">FI) level remained
positive (Figure 2C). After that, we then performed RCA reaction under more
various concentrations of let-7a to determine the detailed relationship between
miRNA concentration and </SPAN><SPAN style="line-height:2;font-family:Perpetua;font-size:18px;">Δ</SPAN><SPAN style="line-height:2;font-family:Perpetua;font-size:18px;">FI. After plotting the </SPAN><SPAN style="line-height:2;font-family:Perpetua;font-size:18px;">Δ</SPAN><SPAN style="line-height:2;font-family:Perpetua;font-size:18px;">FI data against minus logarithm of let-7a
concentration, an exponential curve could be fitted with a squared correlation
coefficient (R</SPAN><SUP><SPAN style="line-height:2;font-family:Perpetua;font-size:18px;">2</SPAN></SUP><SPAN style="line-height:2;font-family:Perpetua;font-size:18px;">) of 0.9763. THE SENSITIVITY OF SUCH METHOD WAS ALSO ESTIMATED
TO BE UNDER 1FM (3 times higher than the standard division of the blank group).
As for the specificity of RCA reaction in water-dissolved samples, a 2-hour RCA
reaction was performed under the 10nM input concentration of let-7a, let-7c,
let-7f and let-7g solutions. Results showed an at least 5-time difference among
let-7a group against other miRNAs (Figure 2D), indicating A BRILLIANT
SPECIFICITY OF RCA REACTION.</SPAN></P><P><SPAN style="line-height:2;font-family:Perpetua;font-size:18px;"> </SPAN></P><P><B><SPAN style="line-height:2;font-family:Perpetua;font-size:18px;">Figure 2.

The excitation wavelength was 495nm, the emission wavelength was 515nm. Fluorescence intensity variation was calculated by subtracting the fluorescent intensity of the blank group. For the calculation of relative fluorescence intensity variation, the let-7a group was set arbitrarily at 1.0, and the levels of the other groups were adjusted correspondingly. All these experiments were run in three parallel reactions, and the error bars were obtained from at least three independent experiments. The squared correlation coefficient (R2) was analyzed by Graphpad Prism 6.0. ** p&lt;0.01.</SPAN></P><P align="center" style="text-align:center;"><B><SPAN style="line-height:2;font-family:Perpetua;font-size:18px;"> </SPAN></B></P><P><SPAN style="line-height:2;font-family:Perpetua;font-size:18px;">To
further determine if such great sensitivity and specificity could be maintained
working on MORE COMPLICATED SAMPLES SUCH AS SERUM, we then dissolved let-7a in
7% human serum for various concentrations to determine the sensitivity of RCA
reaction under such condition (Figure 3A). The human serum was collected and
mixed from serum samples of 50 different healthy volunteers under their consent.
Similarly, real-time fluorescence assay was performed and 150-min reaction time
was determined to be good enough since the difference among different let-7a
concentration was significant enough (Figure 3B and 3C). After expanded into
more groups with various let-7a concentrations, data points on </SPAN><SPAN style="line-height:2;font-family:Perpetua;font-size:18px;">Δ</SPAN><SPAN style="line-height:2;font-family:Perpetua;font-size:18px;">FI vs. -log[let-7a] plot could also

Thus the RCA reaction has a HIGH SENSITIVITY to the low concentration of miRNA.
Specificity evaluation assay was also performed under similar methods as
mentioned above, which then, affirmed the HIGH SPECIFICITY of RCA reaction even
under close-to-field input samples.</SPAN></P><P><SPAN style="line-height:2;font-family:Perpetua;font-size:18px;"> </SPAN></P><P><B><SPAN style="line-height:2;font-family:Perpetua;font-size:18px;">Figure 3.

that the fluorescence signal of 1 pM group were significantly higher than that
of 500 fM group both in these two dissolved conditions (Figure 4). Therefore,
we could believe that this method is capable of monitoring the variation of
serum let7a concentration during cancer development. </SPAN></P><P><SPAN style="line-height:2;font-family:Perpetua;font-size:18px;"> </SPAN></P><P><B><SPAN style="line-height:2;font-family:Perpetua;font-size:18px;">Figure 4.

detecting method</SPAN></SPAN></H3><P><SPAN style="line-height:2;font-family:Perpetua;font-size:18px;">To
move our experiments toward conditions with relatively low tech-condition, we
mainly focused on the VISUALIZATION and FURTHER AMPLIFICATION of RCA outputs.
For such matters, a single guide-RNA mediated CRISPR-Cas9 system and a
split-HRP reporting system was then introduced since the proper designed sgRNA-dCas9
system could provide a relatively solid binding among RCA production and dCas9
protein and split-HRP reporter could robustly amplify and visualize the
upstream signal. Thus, fusion proteins containing split-HRP fragments and dCas9
protein, namely sHRP-C-dCas9 and sHRP-N-dCas9 were designed and cloned onto
expression vector. Then, the plasmid was sequencing verified and transformed
into the </SPAN><I><SPAN style="line-height:2;font-family:Perpetua;font-size:18px;">E.coli</SPAN></I><SPAN style="line-height:2;font-family:Perpetua;font-size:18px;"> BL21 (DE3) competent
cells. After a overnight culture with (or without, as
control group) 0.5mM IPTG induction, cells were collected and lysed by high
pressure homogenizer. Subsequent purification was performed by nickel-nitrilotriacetic
acid agarose affinity chromatography according to the standard protocol. As examined
by SDS-PAGE and Western blots (probed with an anti-His-tag antibody), both of
these proteins were successfully expressed and purified as a high degree of
purity up to 90% (Figure 5). </SPAN></P><P><SPAN style="line-height:2;font-family:Perpetua;font-size:18px;"> </SPAN></P><P><B><SPAN style="line-height:2;font-family:Perpetua;font-size:18px;">Figure 5.

gained purified fusion proteins, HRP activity assay was performed trying to
visualize and signal-augment previous gained RCA output (Figure 6A). In such
assay, TMB was used as substrate to form blue-colored TMB diamine as a visible
signal. This reaction was then halted by addition of 0.16M sulfuric acid and turned
the solution into yellow with maximum absorbance at 450nm. Also, different
concentrations of fusion protein were tested to further improving the system
effectiveness. </SPAN></P><P><SPAN style="line-height:2;font-family:Perpetua;font-size:18px;">Similarly,

adding the sulfuric acid also gave a clue that visual difference could be
obtained among different amount of input microRNAs under all tested protein
concentrations, and 5μg of protein was then proven to be the
optimal among two protein concentrations tested. After plotting the </SPAN><SPAN style="line-height:2;font-family:Perpetua;font-size:18px;">Δ</SPAN><SPAN style="line-height:2;font-family:Perpetua;font-size:18px;">OD <SUB>450</SUB> data against minus logarithm of let-7a

their consent. Patient group was formed by two phase III patients, two phase IV
patients and one phase V patient. To evaluate the optimal explosion effect of the
serum miRNAs, which were previously reported to mainly exist as RNA-protein
complex or even in exosomes, for further detection, we used different methods
for the pre-treatment of serum samples (Figure 8A). RCA reaction followed by a
Sybr I fluorescence assay revealed that both the approaches of serum RNA
extraction by TRIzol LS and 10% serum boiled in 95</SPAN><SPAN style="line-height:2;font-family:Perpetua;font-size:18px;">℃</SPAN><SPAN style="line-height:2;font-family:Perpetua;font-size:18px;"> for 15 min can show a
significantly lower concentration of let-7a in NSCLC patients compared to
healthy people, and the latter is more convenient and effective (Figure 8B). Which
then, made the low-cost, high efficient RNA extraction possible for field-ready
detection of miRNAs in serum sample. The concentration difference of serum
let-7a between NSCLC patients and healthy people determined by our method was
corroborated to the previous literature reported 20%-60% decrease measured

all previous mentioned methods together, and expand the sample mumbers into 20 (10 from healthy volunteers and 10 from NSCLC patients), the complete work flow for tube-based
serum miRNA detection was tested with previously collected samples from healthy
people and NSCLC patients. After a 200-min detection process, containing serum pre-treatment,
RCA reaction, dCas9 binding and HRP activity assay (Figure 8C), results showed
that observable color difference could be obtained among healthy people and
NSCLC patients (Figure 8D). The OD</SPAN><SUB><SPAN style="line-height:2;font-family:Perpetua;font-size:18px;">450</SPAN></SUB><SPAN style="line-height:2;font-family:Perpetua;font-size:18px;"> result obtained after adding

For such matter, theoretical calculation and experimental results were well integrated and a brilliant probability model was introduced.
The relationships were obtained and shown below.
