Model
Development of A Novel Blood-MicroRNA Handy Detection System with CRISPR
HomePage • AWARDS • Model
Abstract
This   model is created to evaluate the effectiveness of initial design, and offers   guidelines on how the system can (or must) be improved. (You can go to PROJECT. page to see more.) The core idea is to simulate the process of producing the signal which can be detected, and draw a conclusion by obtaining the relationship between the signal intensity and the concentration of miRNA.
Introduction
We   create mathematical models of two aspects of our project, a RCA model and a   signal detection model.
The RCA   model is based on the Michaelis-Menten equation. We can obtain the relationship   between the concentration of miRNA and the number of stem-loop structures   through theoretical calculation, and we use our experimental results to   calculate the parameters we introduced previously.
In the   signal detection model, we combine a probability model with the kinetic equation   of enzymatic reaction, so we can obtain the relationship between the number of   stem-loop structures and the signal intensity under the premise of adding a   certain amount of the fusion proteins of dCas9 and split-HRP fragments.
By   integrating the two models, we can theoretically predict the impacts of the   molecule number of proteins on the signal to noise ratio and explain the trend   of the signal intensity variation against the change of the concentration of miRNA in our   wet-lab work.
Assumption and Justification
About model
1. MiRNA is not degraded throughout the reaction process.
2. The two fusion proteins of dCas9 and split-HRP fragments have the   same ability to combine with the stem-loop structure, and only when two   different proteins next to each other, can they have the ability to catalyze   substrate and produce signal.
3. The number of stem-loop structures in each RCA product is equal   under a certain reaction time.
4. The enzymatic activity remains unchanged with time under the premise   of excessive amount of enzymes or a short-time reaction.
About the data
1. The data we obtain from wet-lab experiment are reliable.
2. All the results are trustworthy in the process of statistical   processing and data calculation.

The RCA model
Firstly, we   assume that there is a linear relationship between the   concentration of the initiated probes and miRNA as the combination reaction   between miRNA and probe occurs spontaneously1 . This can be written   as:
Next,   RCA is an enzymatic reaction, the reaction equation is written as: iprobe+dNTP→  iprobe-dN+PPi, under the premise of excessive amount of enzymes and dNTPs, the   relationship between the concentration of iprobe and the initial speed of RCA   can be described by the Michaelis-Menten equation. This can be written as：
It is   obvious that there is a linear relationship between the molecule numbers of   iprobe-dN (n1 , reflects the molecule numbers of RCA product) and the initial speed of RCA   reaction. Notably, under the premise of excessive amount of enzymes, the   extending of each RCA production is related to the reaction time, not the   concentration of the iprobe. It is a linear relationship when we assume that the   enzymatic activity remains unchanged with time, thus, the number of stem-loop   structures (n2 ) in each RCA product is stable under the premise of a certain reaction time.
Figure 1. Schematic diagram
This   can be written as:
And   then, SYBR Green binds to DNA. The resulting DNA-dye-complex absorbs blue light (λmax = 497nm)   and emits green light (λmax = 520nm). Thus, there is a linear relationship between the total amount of stem-loop structures and the   fluorescence intensity of DNA-dye-complex. This can be written as:
In   summary, the relationship between the concentration of miRNA and the   fluorescence intensity of DNA-dye-complex can be written as:
The signal detection model
Firstly, it is   obvious that there is a linear relationship between   the molecule number of formed intact HRP proteins in the solution (consider as   NOISE) and the molecule number of the fusion proteins in the solution. This can   be written as:
Next,   we build a probability model to find the expression of the molecule number of   formed intact HRP proteins (fused with dCas9) through binding with stem-loop   structure (consider as SIGNAL). It is related to the total amount of stem-loop   structures and the molecule number of DNA-bound fusion proteins. We obtain the   result by Monte Carlo method.

Figure 3. The result of the probability model Plot of the   expect value of the molecule number of formed intact proteins against the total   amount of stem-loop structures, carried out at 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 0.9 of   N2 to n ratio.
The   result can be written as:
As for N2, which refers to the molecule number of the fusion proteins binding with stem-loop structure. The equation is formulated based on the limiting case. The equation can be written as:
And   then, we can obtain the expressions for ρ and I separately.
Notably, under   the premise of excessive substrates, it is a linear relationship between the reaction rate and the concentration of enzymes when we assume that the enzymatic activity remain unchanged with time, thus, we can obtain the expression of the signal intensity at tth time-step. This is written as:
In   summary, the relationship between the number of stem-loop structures and SNR   under the premise of adding a certain amount of the fusion proteins can be   written as:
The   relationship between the number of Stem-loop structures and the signal intensity   under the premise of adding a certain amount of the fusion proteins can be   written as:
The calculation of the constants
To   simplify the equation (1), the constants can be integrated. As can be seen from the above table, k1, k2, k3 are constants representing the scale factor, Km and Vmax are characteristic constants of phi 29 DNA polymerase, and n2,   which refers to the number of stem-loop structures in each RCA product, is stable under the premise of a certain reaction time. Thus, define two constants, mark as a and b, and then the equation   can be simplified as:
We use   this equation to fit the data points obtained through experiments. (Figure 2.  (D)in the RESULTS.page ) The fitting   curve is shown below.
Figure 4. Fitting curve Fitting curve of fluorescence   intensity of DNA-dye-complex (RFU) against the concentrations of miRNA   (pM).
With   regard to the equation (2), we set the parameters based on the experiments as   follows: k3 =8.35*10-16 (n=y1/k3); k4 =0.038; k5t=5.9*10-12.
Results and Analysis
By   integrating the two models, we can obtain the relationships between SNR, the   signal intensity respectively and the concentration of miRNA under different   addition amount of fusion proteins.
The   results are shown below.
Figure 5. The signal intensity (OD450) Three-dimensional map of signal   intensity (OD450) against miRNA concentration(pM) and additional amount of fusion proteins.
There   exists a monotonous relation between the concentration of miRNA and the signal   intensity when the value of the molecule number of the fusion proteins is   relatively large. While the relationship does not hold when the value of the   molecule number of the fusion proteins is relatively small. And the signal   intensity increases as the value of the molecule number of the fusion proteins   increases.
Figure 6. The result of SNR Three-dimensional map of signal   to noise ratio against miRNA concentration (pM) and additional amount of fusion   proteins.
The   signal-to-noise ratio decreases as the value of the molecule number of fusion   proteins increases.
Test of model
Our   model predicts the relationship between the signal intensity and the   concentration of miRNA under the premise of adding a certain amount of the   fusion proteins of dCas9 and split-HRP fragments. So we can test if our model is   reasonable by comparing the curves predicted by the model with those obtained   from the experiment. The results are shown below.
Figure 7.  Test of model Plot of the signal intensity (OD450) against miRNA concentration (pM) predicted by the model and experimented by wet-lab. (A) The value of the molecule number of each fusion protein added to the system is set to be 4.66e+13. The mass of each fusion protein added to the system in wet-lab is 0.5 ng. (B) The value of the molecule number of each fusion protein added to the system is set to be 4.66e+14. The mass of each fusion protein added to the system in wet-lab is 5 ng.
We can learn   from the figure above that the general trend of curves predicted by the model agree well with the experimental results.
Model extension
Furthermore, we   consider that it is conducive to signal detection when the value of signal   intensity and SNR are both greater than two. We obtain the ideal region through   calculation, which is shown as below.
Figure 8. Ideal region Region of qualified logarithm of   concentrations of miRNA (pM) and logarithm of the additional amount of fusion   proteins.
When   the value of N is set to e+13.3, the range of the value of x contained in the   ideal region is a maximum, which means when the value of the molecule number of   the fusion proteins is e+13.3, the concentration range of miRNA that can be   detected is maximum.
Conclusion
Based   on our simulation, we came to the conclusion that:
The general trend of curves predicted by the model are in good agreement with the experimental   results, thus indicating that our model is reasonable.
The   value of the molecule number of the fusion protein of dCas9 and split-HRP   fragments not only affects the signal-to-noise ratio, but also the signal   intensity. So we need to weigh its impact on both to select the optimal   solution.
The   concentration range of miRNA that can be detected is a maximum when we set the   value of the molecule number of the fusion proteins to be e+13.3, building on   which, our wet-lab protocol could be optimized in our future work.
