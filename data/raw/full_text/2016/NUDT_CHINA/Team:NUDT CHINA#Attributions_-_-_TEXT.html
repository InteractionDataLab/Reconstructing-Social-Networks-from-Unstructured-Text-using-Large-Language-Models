Our   project wouldn’t proceed smoothly without the contribution of any member of the   team. Team Leader: Our team came into existence under the leadership of   Xinyuan Qiu in December 2015. He observed our characteristics carefully and   exerted our greatest potential. Our team worked efficiently due to his   outstanding   leadership. Experiment: Xinyuan Qiu, Chushu Zhu, Yue Wang and Yishi Lu   completed most of the experiments. Wiki: Everyone shared his or her brilliant ideas about the style of   the   wiki. Jiaxin Ma worked on the visual appearance of it. Xinyuan Qiu was   responsible for web copy writing. Poster: Chushu Zhu was engaged in composing the texts in our   poster.   Jiaxin Ma and Xinyuan Qiu devoted themselves to the layout and the art design of   the poster. Presentation: Xinyuan Qiu, Jiaxin Ma and Chushu Zhu will give the   presentations during the competition, they have rehearsed several times and all   of us gathered and discussed to improve it. Team Shirt: Yufei Xu designed our team shirt. Modeling: Chushu Zhu and Xinyuan Qiu were in charge of the   modeling. Human practice: Dongyu Fan and Jiaxin Ma were in charge of HP.   Yifan Zhang and Qijie Xu designed an interesting game   based on our project. Yue Wang popularized some basic knowledge of cancer in the   community together with Xi Cheng. Besides, they went to the Second Xiangya   Hospital of Central South University to interview Dr. Wenjin Li and Dr. Tao Hou   about cancer. Jiaxin Ma and Huifang Wang designed a questionnaire to know the   public awareness of early detection of cancer. Yishi Lu organized a great debate   on ethical issues about cancer. Ruixuan Cheng was in charge of “LAB OPEN DAY”.   Jiaxin Ma and Xi Cheng did a survey about the cost of the early cancer detection   product in the market and estimated the expected cost of our product.
Acknowledgments
We   would like to express our deepest gratitude towards every person and institution   that have helped us. General Support: The project was supported by the Department of   Chemistry   and Biology of College of Science, National University of Defense Technology. Project support and advice: This project was come up with due to a   brainstorming and then we discussed the details about it in a group. We designed   the experiments under the help of our primary PI Dr. Lvyun Zhu. Besides, Dr.   Lvyun Zhu helped us to be familiar with the experimental operations. Our   secondary PI Prof. Lingyun Zhu provided us a dedicated laboratory, equipments   and great advises to ensure the smooth development of our project, and helped us   to contact other colleges and institutes for collaboration. Our instructor   Xiaomin Wu offered us the guidelines about conventional experimental techniques.   Dr. Zonghuang Ye from the Department of Chemistry and Biology introduced some   relevant background knowledge to us. Mr. Zhe Liu and   Prof. Dongyi Zhang offered us some important suggestions about the project. Fundraising help and advice: We got experimental funding support   from our   PIs Prof. Lingyun Zhu and Dr. Lvyun Zhu and travel funding support from College   of Science of NUDT. Our advisor Lu Min was in charge of expenses management. Lab support: Department of Chemistry   and Biology of College of Science provided a biology experimental platform for   us. Difficult technique support: Our lab was newly established and is   short of the equipment which is able to do the nucleotide sequence screening. In   light of this, we bought the sequencing service from InvitrogenTM .   Our devices and systems of parts was all verified there.  Most of our regents   such as enzyme were bought from TaKaRaTM and some other bio-tech   companies. IDT provided us with the prime synthesize service.  Genscript helped   to forward our part samples shipments to iGEM HQ. Project adviser support: Our advisor Long Liu provided us solutions   when   we face difficulties in the process of proceeding the project. Experiment support: Dr. Wenjin Li and Dr. Tao Hou from the Second   Xiangya Hospital of Central South University and Dr. De-an Tan from the Hospital   of NUDT were concerned about our   experimental work and helped us to get some serum samples from healthy   volunteers   and patients. We are eager to express our sincere thanks to all the volunteers   (especially the patients) for their selfless voluntary devotion. We'd also like to appreciate Dr. Haoqian Zhang and Mr. Yihao Zhang from iGEM2015   team Peking for their generous support by providing timely suggestions on   protein expression and purification. Human Practices support: Dr. Wenjin Li and Dr. Tao Hou from the   Second   Xiangya Hospital of Central South University, were very kindly to answer our   question about cancer. Wiki support: Our instructors Qijun Liu provided us solutions when   we   face difficulties in the process of wiki production. Model support: Our advisor Shaoliang Peng from the Supercomputer   Center in NUDT, helped us optimize simulation algorithm and ran parallel program   on Tianhe. Yuling Yang and Deyao Yu, our schoolmates from College of Science,   provived us guidelines about programming and model optimization.
