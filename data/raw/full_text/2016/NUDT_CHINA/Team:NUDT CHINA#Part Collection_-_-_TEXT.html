Part Collection
Introduction
This part collection, namely PPI Tool-kit, contained 18 new parts design for protein-protein interaction (PPI) researches.
In PPI Toolkit, we collected basic parts containing the coding sequence of three split-reporting systems: split-GFP, split-Luciferase, and split-HRP. All those basic parts were codon-optimized to be expressed in E.coli, and sequence-modified to meet the demands of RCF10. Building on that, amazing parts combining split-reporting system with a novel substitution system were designed, characterized and then added into the collection. Through which two proteins could be fused with their corresponding split-reporter fragment at the same time in one simple Golden-Gate Assembly, thus dramatically simplified the cloning process.

All parts in this kit were functional validated, well characterized and submitted to the registry.
