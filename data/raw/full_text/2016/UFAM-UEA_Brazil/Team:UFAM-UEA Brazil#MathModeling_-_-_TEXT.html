MATHEMATICS SECTION
According to our bench project we divided the Math Modelling in two: (1) RFP production taking in account the regulation of MerR gene, which turns RFP expression possible only in the presence of Mercury. This model allow us to understand the force of the new promoters we designed by the speed of RFPâ€™s production; (2) A model to predict the production of the complex Omp-A-Phytochelatin and bioaccumulation of mercury.
