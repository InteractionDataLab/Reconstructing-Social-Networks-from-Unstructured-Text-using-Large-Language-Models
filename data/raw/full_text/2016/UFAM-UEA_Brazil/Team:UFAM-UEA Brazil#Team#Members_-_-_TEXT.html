Biotechnology student. She knows everything about enzymatic digestion! Everything! All buffers, the correct among of DNA without using spectrophotometer.
Hey you! Also called Andy even by my mom. 21 yo, Biotechnology undergraduate student. Love music, dancing and photography. Born almost an Amazonian fish according to the time I spend swimming in the rivers.
Also known as Gio, 20 years, biotechnology lover and student. Gothic and crazy about astrology (this wasn’t written by me, but it’s true). Really into experimenting new types of beer. My surname isn’t Maklouf at all, it is hangout after classes. A friend you may count anytime you need to.
Hi, I'm Itanei Sarah, I'm 28 years old, I am a biologist and a student of biotechnology at the Federal University of Amazonas, passionate about science. I believe that through it we can work better against adversity of the modern world and improve it to humanity.
Hello! I’m Julie Loiola, a 19-year-old medical student at the State University of Amazonas. It amazes me how science is applicable in many fields of study, and can be effective to change the reality of many people for the best, including health aspects. And I want to contribute to this change.
22-year- old undergraduate computer science student at Federal University of Amazonas.  He knows everything there is to know about the wiki design!
The cuttest person in the team - everybody agrees. Kinda workaholic (completely, actually). Addicted to chocolate and care about astrology, such as Giovanna. Joined the team during the first semester (2014) of my Biotechnology graduation, recognized as a scientific babie, but, now, not that babie.
19 yo, biotechnology student, passionate about SynBio. She knows by heart everything about our synthetic genetic circuits! All genes function, RBS sequences (AGGAGG), promoters (TTGACA, TATAAT), parts compositions...
Hi! I'm Mary, 21yo, medical student of the State University of Amazonas. I'm passionate about life and love studying it! Faith, studies, coffee, music and love summarize my biography. Google Docs crazy lady!

Advisors
Genetic engineering professor (mad!) at Federal University of Amazonas. The founder of our team in Manaus! In 2012, convinced all students to enter in this madness that is Synthetic Biology. After that, there were no students without dark circles. And nobody is sad be his side! In the team, contributed stimulating students to go further in the project.
Extremely patient post-doctoral researcher. Brings lunch at Sundays.
Lab technician and team's Big Mom. Knows where E-V-E-R-Y reagent is. Our handyman during experiments
Genetic engineering professor (mad too!) – often called “daddy” by hundred of mentees! He has so much experience that does not need a spectrophotometer to measure DNA amounts. He’s just awesome! He guided us and debated our project daily. Gave valuable tips!
