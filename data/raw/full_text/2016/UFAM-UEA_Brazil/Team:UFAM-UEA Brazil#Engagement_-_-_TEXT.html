Engagement
From kids, showing that they have a special way to deal with environment issues and how can we teach them some “complicated” themes Kids Science Zone to prosecutors and politicians Courthouse stablishing new conections. Now, we have some perspective to improve legislation about mercury emission and fiscalization;
"The iGEM 2016 kit arrived!!!!" That was the most repeated sentence the day the iGEM parts (start kit) came. Right away we were invited to use biobricks in the undergraduate classes of genetic engineering and molecular biology related ones. And they were mesmerized in how easy and rapid is to use the standard vectors with its restriction enzymes. You can imagine: E. coli plates with several colors, genes knockout, parts exchanging between groups, and so on. Not satisfied we went to high-schools to develop the lectures using bacteria models like DIY and explained how to make genetic constructions with many neon bracelets and LED lights! Igem Academy We had also worked in workshops to attract high school students to our lab and we had such a huge demand of new internships. With new collaborations we executed the 1st Science Olympic Games explaining about how SynBio is helping us to provide new alternatives to mercury bioremediation and mercury pollution. The success was extensive! Now the teachers of that school apply tests and included the SynBio in the subjects.
Also: found a thirsty audience for science. There we played several notices and interviews about our project. And for last we went famous! Yes we got the news and for a moment we thought we were Hollywood super stars. One of the biggest Brazilian newspaper knew our job and wanted an interview.  That was a the glory, everyone now would know about our job, about synthetic biology, about iGEM! Yes, indeed much of it happen and were a trend topic for some time in the science section from Estadao newspaper, even the Google company and a bank called us and support us with some substantial amount with the crowdfunding campaign where we earned 252% of our target Crowdfunding . That's why we came to Boston with almost everyone from the team.
