See how we divided tasks alongside our team!</P><H1 class="h-Team">Acknowledgements</H1><P>Along our journey we had support from many, many people. By donating money, giving advice, helping with things we couldn’t do on our own, letting us into spaces we had no access or just believing in what we’re doing, these people have a special place in our hearts. We couldn’t conquer anything without them!</P><H1 class="h-Team">Collaborations</H1><P>Science and technology are awesome things and we enjoy it! But for sure is not an easy or inexpensive activity. In science, achievements can be accomplished only with a lot of help from individuals and institutions. Here we are proud to present our partners in this passionate journey.</P><H1 class="h-Team">Sponsors</H1></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
