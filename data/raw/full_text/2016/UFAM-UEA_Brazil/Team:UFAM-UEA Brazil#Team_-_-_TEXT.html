TEAM
Members
We are the UFAM-UEA_Brazil team! Our team is driven by enthusiasm and dedication. We are from Federal and State University of Amazonas, both universities craved in the heart of Amazon rainforest! We work so hard during the iGEM season. Now that you know all about our project, we invite you to meet this awesome team!
Attributions
It's like the popular saying... "one swallow, does not make a summer". See how we divided tasks alongside our team!
Acknowledgements
Along our journey we had support from many, many people. By donating money, giving advice, helping with things we couldn’t do on our own, letting us into spaces we had no access or just believing in what we’re doing, these people have a special place in our hearts. We couldn’t conquer anything without them!
Collaborations
Science and technology are awesome things and we enjoy it! But for sure is not an easy or inexpensive activity. In science, achievements can be accomplished only with a lot of help from individuals and institutions. Here we are proud to present our partners in this passionate journey.
