Acknowledgements
Marina e Fernando Garcia.
Our sincere gratitude for making the bioreactor prototype come true, and for gracing us with the unique opportunity of learning about this area with you that know so much about it.
Marco Moreira
We thank you for the incentive and belief in our work, also for keeping in touch with our team.
Elen Pedraça dos Santos
We appreciate for making the time to help us in our research; the many and many hours passed in the laboratory, the perseverance and for always hope for the best results, even when we didn’t expect it!
Diego Moreira
The best competent cells in the neighborhood of block G! Thank you for your patience and understanding when we were on the edge of the humanly possible level of stress.
Rebeca Vale
Our deep appreciation for this teacher who loves her students, knowledge, science and education. We wish our country was full of good professionals like you, committed to education and competent in what they do. We hope to always count on your partnership!
Clarissa Thomé, Estadão journalist
Since the publication on this national communication vehicle, our project has grown a lot in visibility and had wide dissemination. We thank you for your participation on the construction of our team’s image and our campaign to MIT!
Kleber Júnior
Few teams in the world have the opportunity of counting on a kitchen chef renowned in amazonian gastronomy as a logo designer. Our tastes and hearts thank you!
Rômulo de Sousa
Thanks for your commitment to the recordings and edits of a little dream of ours! Your dedication and care for the final results of our project are capable to thrill and touch all of those who were able to see this important result.
Edson do Carmo Júnior e Lanna Lobo
What to do when you don’t have a clue on how to create a bioreactor? You ask the experts for help! Thank you for your giant patience in guiding us to conduct the experiments inside the laboratory and being always available to help in any unforeseen event.
Tereza Cristina Oliveira
We thank you for granting us access to the CRPM’s analytical center so we could finish our mercury measurements in contaminated water
Daniela Chaves
Since iGEM demands our engagement in many fields outside the lab sometimes we get a little lost when dealing with unfamiliar area, like our Public Civil Action. By helping us with those challenging juridic words, we couldn’t finish our schedule without you.
Diana Coelho and Unicorn Studio
We had some design issues, the deadline was closer and closer and we were very flustered and you came right when we needed the most. We couldn’t forget to tell how grateful we are!
Iguatemi Costa
Your trust boosted us to higher flights. By donating money, we could finish our schedule so thank  you so much!
Matheus Costa
We thank you for your patience while introducing us to the law world and for giving us great tips on this field. Thanks for being alongside us on decisive moments of our legal activities and donating your time to the cause.
Isabela Sales
Our special acknowledgement for introducing us on the legal motions and for sending us on the right paths, on the right directions. It was important to learn from you the care with the indigenous people and amazonian populations, especially considering the impacts of our project on that society.
Isaac Guerreiro
Taught us journalism tricks to conquer a good dissemination space. Many thanks for the tireless assistance and support when we reached the top of our spread and recognition. Thanks for making our news more popular than the ones from nationally known bands. We love you <3
Denison Aguiar
Organized the lecture “Human Rights Violation and Mercury on Brazilian Amazonia”. We appreciate the availability and tenderness with the team, all your empathy and patience in directioning us on the Environmental Law. For engaging on our commitments and making us a commitment to Amazonia’s future, on a scale we can’t measure.
Lais Almeida, Marcos Andrei, Luna Lacerda and Viviane Nogueira
They were a part of the team and initiated our researches about mercury. Our perseverance on this competition was initiated by them! Young pioneers that left their comfort zones and inspire us by leaving a legacy we expect to honor. Thanks 2013 and 2014 UFAM Team!
Leissandra Castelo, Kerollen Runa, Juliana Vitoriano, Raquel Queiroz, Regiane Linhares
When we needed a helping hand to our experiments you were there for us and we are very grateful for that!
Fabíola Medeiros, Vivian Oliveira & Alexia Alves
So grateful for learning so much with you. The babies who followed us since the class about paternity tests, you girls felt so interested in SynBio, even you are at high school, that this could inspire us to continue alongside all difficulties!Hope you come back soon <3
Patricia Siqueira e Dona Elza
Their support was of great importance, many times they thought us more practical and correct ways of proceeding in the laboratory. Our only complaint is that you guys think it’s so funny to watch us working all weekend. Thanks for everything! See you Saturday! Or not!
Paulo A. C. Simonetti
Thanks for spreading the knowledge about Bioengineering to college students through a lecture.
Prof. José Odair Pereira
THANKS, THANKS, THANKS!!! Saved our subclonings (and lives) when providing the enzymes that we needed! THANK YOU SO MUCH PROFESSOR!!
Lawany Pritesh
How to participate on a competition like iGEM without the plasmidial extraction kit? You can’t, right? When ours ended (again), professor Pritesh saved us. THANKS!!!
Dona Mara
For opening the laboratory’s door and letting us work even though we always make a mess (sorry!). Thanks, Mrs Mara, you’re awesome!
Our gratitude to all people who helped us in our Crowdfunding campaign:
Circe Marcondes Gomes Pereira
Germano da Costa Rosa
