We established a partnership with them, exchanging different types of knowledge from our teams.</P><P>We also had a great time in Sao Paulo with them, attended a USP SynBio club meeting and share our iGEM experience from previous years.</P><H3>Molecular Biology</H3><P>Since our team has experience in molecular biology, we offered USP_UNIFESP team mentoring during their lab duties. Some Skype meetings were conducted, we discussed issues and gave protocol tips.</P><H3>Bioprocess</H3><P>USP_UNIFESP team helped us having some discussions about the implementation of our bioreactor prototype.</P><H3>3D printing of a bioreactor model</H3><P>Our prototype bioreactor was constructed in Manaus, but we wanted to show the world what we've done! So, with USP_UNIFESP help, we designed and printed a 3D model of our bioreactor. This model was printed in SÃ£o Paulo and sent to us in Manaus, so we can take it to 2016 Giant Jamboree in Boston.</P><H2 style="background:#E57003;margin-bottom:0.5em"><B>University of Buenos Aires</B></H2><P>To encourage and startup new teams in Latin America is a noble task which we are totally into. We participate in the <A href="http://tecnox.exp.dc.uba.ar/manaus/index.php/Main_Page" target="blank" style="color:#40FF00">TECNOx</A>, a Latin American contest for disruptive technologies (including synthetic biology!) to help to solve the continent problems. We had a great interaction with teams from Argentina, Mexico and Colombia. From this event we also started a network in math modeling with experts from Buenos Aires University. The experience was so positive we brought a student (Denys Bulavka) to give a one-week workshop in modeling at our university. It was there, at the workshop, we learned a lot and we finished up this part of our project.</P><P>It's worth to remember the Buenos Aires University was the only one in Latin America who won the Best Math Modeling prize at iGEM (in 2013). So we hook up together and found ways to describe our work in math language as well as worked in prediction systems (link para modeling). We build up our model for RFP production responding to our designed promoters and check its force and also we mode  Phytochelatin production. Our idea now is to keep the partnership and create a new team composed by two universities from different countries in order to propel the Latin America participation in the competitions. From other side Denys had lot of fun in Manaus, where he could take shower in some Amazonian water falls! Great job Denys and thanks a lot to the Buenos Aires University!</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
