Basic Part
EutS(BBa_K2129001) is derived from EutSMNLK (BBa_K31100). This single protein is capable of forming bacterial microcompartments on its own, and can be visualized with EutC 1-19 tagged fluorescent proteins. We think that this part presents exciting opportunities for future teams; the EutC tag enables any small enough protein to be isolated within these cages, which has an enormous range of potential applications.
