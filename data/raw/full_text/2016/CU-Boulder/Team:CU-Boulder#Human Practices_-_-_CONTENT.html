At the Second Mile High Meetup, which was attended in part by community members, and at the Andrews dorm on CU campus, a dormitory consisting primarily of non-biology majors, we presented some of our research and introduced the idea and possible applications of bacterial microcompartments. </P><P class="main">
We discussed how our system worked, how we were implementing it, introduced the idea of incorporating non-canonical amino acids into proteins, and presented our ideas on how one might use a bacterial microcompartment. People were engaged on the idea of this ‘microscopic box’ and what they might think you could use it for. The idea behind having a box that you can open and close is close to universally understood, so the concept of a micro-scale box was one many could engage with!</P><H3> Mile High Meetup #2, Denver Biolabs 10/14/16 </H3><P class="main">
Present to the Denver biolabs team and a larger crowd of the community that supports the biolabs. Sparked great conversation for community labs and further research in the field. Our hope was to assist in education the public about the benefits and possibilities of biological research.</P><H3> Andrews Hall Science Symposium, University of Colorado 10/24/16 </H3><P class="main">
Andrews Residence Hall annually displays the research opportunities available to students on campus and asks current students to present the research they have be doing. The final presentation of our research before the Jamboree, was given to the incoming class of engineering students at Andrews Residence Hall. Many inspired students began to show their interest in doing further research and were excited to learn about our project and the opportunities on campus.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
