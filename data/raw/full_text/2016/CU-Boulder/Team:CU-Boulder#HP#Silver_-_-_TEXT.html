Bacterial microcompartments are fundamentally an idea that many people in the general public can understand; micro-scale boxes that you can use for storage and containment. At the Second Mile High Meetup, which was attended in part by community members, and at the Andrews dorm on CU campus, a dormitory consisting primarily of non-biology majors, we presented some of our research and introduced the idea and possible applications of bacterial microcompartments.
We discussed how our system worked, how we were implementing it, introduced the idea of incorporating non-canonical amino acids into proteins, and presented our ideas on how one might use a bacterial microcompartment. People were engaged on the idea of this ‘microscopic box’ and what they might think you could use it for. The idea behind having a box that you can open and close is close to universally understood, so the concept of a micro-scale box was one many could engage with!
