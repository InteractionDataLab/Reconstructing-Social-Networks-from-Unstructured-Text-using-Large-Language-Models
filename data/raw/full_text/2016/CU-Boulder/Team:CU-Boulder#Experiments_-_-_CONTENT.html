Bacterial microcompartments represent fascinating opportunities for molecular level control. We thought to take the EutS component of EutSMNLK and use it to make single component microcompartments. We would visualize these microcompartments using a EutC1-19 tagged eGFP, and then test a variety of expression levels to see what levels would be most effective, and so decided using a two-plasmid system to enable us to swap these two components as we saw fit would help us characterize the compartments. To see what formed the best compartments, we would take images via fluorescent microscopy of the localization of our EutC-eGFP.</P><P class="main">
The second goal of our project was to make a light-sensitive compartment that we could break at will using light by incorporation of an azo-phenylalanine compound containing non-canonical amino acid. In order to accomplish this, we explored the possible mutation sites using molecular modelling, and then introduced a third plasmid to our two-plasmid system containing the necessary expression of a non-canonical tRNA synthetase. We then used fluorescent microscopy to test whether we could construct EutS compartments incorporating azo-phenylalanine, and further test if irradiation with certain light wavelengths could break the cages, distributing the EutC-eGFP throughout the cell.</P><P class="main">
The last goal we had was to characterize the Eut compartment natively found in our NEB-5alpha, and, assuming that the EutC tag still worked, mutate the genome-encoded Eut compartment via CRISPR to introduce lactose induction and later the same amber loci, which we could then use to produce light-sensitive nanocompartments natively in our E.coli. </P><H3> eGFP Visualization of Bacterial Microcompartment</H3><P class="main">
In order to characterize our microcompartment and ensure that it could still form upon transition to BioBrick, we needed a way to measure formation. For this, we used EutC1-19, a portion of the amino acid sequence for the EutC protein, a member of the Eut operon. Past research has shown that by attaching these 19 amino acids to the sequence of eGFP, you can localize the eGFP inside of EutSMNLK cages. This idea would enable us to test our EutS compartments at various levels of expression and see how they differed in formation, size, and localization efficacy. </P><P class="main">
In order to use this method of characterization, we first needed to create a two-plasmid system which we could co-transform with our NEB-5alpha E.coli. We used PCR with BioBrick prefix and suffix extended primers to take EutS from BBa_K311004, the EutSMNLK sequence, and then use similar primers with a EutC 1-19 extension to tag our eGFP. These two PCR products can then be ligated into different plasmid backbones, transformed, and then grown with the two necessary antibiotics. Using pre-prepared expression cassettes with different promoters and binding sites, we explored which expression levels produced the best results under fluorescent microscopy. </P><P class="main"><FIGURE align="center"><FIGCAPTION align="center">EutS eGFP Compartmentalization</FIGCAPTION></FIGURE></P><H3> Two-Plasmid System localizes fluorescent proteins </H3><P class="main">

In order to produce a bacterial microcompartment capable of light sensitive breakage, we would first need to produce a non-canonical amino acid incorporating azo-phenylalanine, the light-sensitive compound we wanted to use. To accomplish this, we first needed to come to an understanding of how the EutS compartment monomers assembled into a full compartment using modelling of their hexameric structures. Once we understood the superstructure, we then chose sites which could interfere with the association between individual EutS proteins. </P><P class="main"><FIGURE style="float:left"><FIGCAPTION style="margin-left: 90px;padding: 10px 10px 10px; width: 24em;">Wild type EutS residue with mutation candidate residues colored red.</FIGCAPTION></FIGURE></P><P class="main">
To do this, we used PyRosetta, a Python-based interface to the Rosetta molecular modeling suite. It enables a user to create custom molecular modeling algorithms with Rosetta sampling and scoring functions using Python scripting. Using the basic PyRosetta scoring function, the wild type EutS protein was scored to find a reference value. Then, one by one, each residue was replaced with a tryptophan to simulate the large size of the non-canonical residue. These mutations were scored and the mutations with energy values which were 75% or greater of the wild type were chosen as possible mutation candidates. </P><P class="main">
The next step was to use the molecular modeling program PyMOL to visualize the docking of the hexamers to better select residues to mutate. Residues which were located where two hexamers came together and which also had energy values similar to the wild type were chosen as the final targets, so that the stereochemical change of the non-canonical amino acid would be theoretically disrupting inter-hexamer interactions, but not intra-hexamer.</P><P class="main">
Once these sites were chosen, we performed PCR mutagenesis on our EutS-containing plasmid to change our target residues to Amber stop codons. Once we accomplished these mutations, we introduced a third plasmid into our system, containing a tRNA synthetase that recognizes AzoPhe, which with its other associated proteins could incorporate AzoPhe at the amber stop codons we introduced to EutS. After growing these cells with pre-irradiated AzoPhe, we were able to see whether the mutant EutS could still form a microcompartment, and whether irradiating the compartment with blue light would be able to cause it to dissociate and disperse the localized eGFP throughout the cell.</P><P class="main"><FIGURE align="center"><FIGCAPTION align="center">EutS Mutation Concept</FIGCAPTION></FIGURE></P><H3> Genome Integration of Light Activated Bacterial Microcompartment </H3><P class="main">
CRISPR editing was performed using an arabinose inducible Cas9 (pX2-Cas9) and a temperature inducible lambda red system to confer recombineering capabilities in E. coli, as described in Bassalo et al 2016. Cas9 from Streptococcus pyogenes was cloned into the broad host range vector pBTX-2 (Prior et al. 2010) and the lambda red system genes was expressed from the pSIM5 plasmid (Datta et al. 2006). The target E. coli strain previously transformed with pX2-Cas9 and pSIM5 was grown to mid-log phase, followed by an incubation at 42˚C for 15 minutes to induce the lambda red system. Induced cells were made electrocompetent and transformed with 200 ng of the gRNA vector, followed by outgrown in LB media supplemented with 0.2% arabinose for 3 hours. The gRNA vector also contained the corresponding homology cassette to repair the double strand break and introduce the designed mutation, as described in Garst et al 2016.The library design for genomic EutS saturation mutagenesis was designed as described in Garst et al 2016. </P><P class="main">
