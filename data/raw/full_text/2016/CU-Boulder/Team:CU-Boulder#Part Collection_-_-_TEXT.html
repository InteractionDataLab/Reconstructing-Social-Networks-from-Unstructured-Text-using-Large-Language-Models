EutS mid and low (BBa_K2129004, BBa_K2129005) express EutS proteins at a medium and low level respectively, which has been characterized to be the best levels of expression for high levels of visible microcompartments. eGFP low (BBa_K2129006) is the best fluorescent protein expression level for visualizing these compartments in the cell, but future teams could use eGFP Pbad (BBa_K2129007) to achieve variable expression levels as seen fit. This collection is an excellent demonstration of the properties of EutS and its ability to localize proteins tagged with EutC 1-19.
