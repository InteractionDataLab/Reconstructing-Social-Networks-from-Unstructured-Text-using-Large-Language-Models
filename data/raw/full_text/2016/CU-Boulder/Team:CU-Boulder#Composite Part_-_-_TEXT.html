Composite Part
Mutant Amber-EutS Mid (BBa_K2129002) is a mutated version of EutS (BBa_K2129001) with an Amber stop codon placed mid sequence. This is designed to enable an amber-codon recognition tRNA to insert non-canonical amino acids at this locus during translation of the EutS protein. This residue location, for the non-canonical amino acid phenylalanine-4â€™-azobenzene, seems to result in variable cage formation, which may be indicative that this protein can be used as a light-activated open/closed nanocompartment. This part could see a wide variety of uses.
