Lab Safety
Our laboratory utilizes many different methods to ensure the safety of the researchers working in it. Foremost, all the members undergo online mandatory safety training and also training on how to handle hazardous biochemical substances. Working with needles the team is also properly trained how to avoid bodily injury.  While in lab when working with E. Coli and Methanococcus we use sterile lab techniques. Furthermore, when working we autoclave biological waste when we are completed with them. Finally through protocols of all lab procedures were used to ensure the safety of the researchers completing the experiment.
