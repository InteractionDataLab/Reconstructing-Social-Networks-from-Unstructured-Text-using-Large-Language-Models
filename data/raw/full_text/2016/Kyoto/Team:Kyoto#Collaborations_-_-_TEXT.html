Collaboration
iGEM Japan Kansai Forum
Hosted by our team, we invited Japanese iGEM teams to the Kansai Forum. We were able to exchange ideas and feedback on each of the teams’ projects. We sincerely thank all of the teams who attended this forum.

Providing Wiki Creation Assisting Software: KELN to iGEM members
Our team has few members who can write HTML codes, making HTML tables for lab notebooks (experimentation results) a serious issue. This was the motivation for the creation of KELN, a software for easily making HTML codes for tables in lab notebook pages.

KELN download
During the forums as listed above, we realized that many iGEM teams are having the same problems. Thus, we made this software open-sourced for usage by any iGEM teams. What follows are their feedback
Gifu
Positive traits: The user interface was very natural, and the time-consuming work of writing HTML codes were significantly shortened
Traits to improve: User manual was mostly about registration and protocols for Eclipse, and there were no instructions to the startup of KELN itself. Also, the table’s rows and column size were fixed, and they couldn’t be interchanged
Hokkaido-U
Positive traits: It was very easy to use.
Traits to improve: User interface: even though it was simple and easy to use, the output screen for showing HTML texts could have been larger.
Comments: Our team makes HTML version of lab notebooks by making a template first and letting people (who may not know HTML) fill in the blank template. If no one in the team knows how to write HTML codes, we think this software could be very helpful. However, if there were someone who can, it may be faster for them to create blank templates. However, a system to register names was very useful, as we didn’t have to type in the experimenter’s name every time. Biobrick parts are also very long and tiresome to type in, so allowing us to register BioBrickparts in the same manner may also improve user experience. We would like to use this software with such improvements in the future.
From such feedback, we improved the registration process of the experimenter names, and continue to provide and upgrade this software. For more information, please follow the links we provided above.
