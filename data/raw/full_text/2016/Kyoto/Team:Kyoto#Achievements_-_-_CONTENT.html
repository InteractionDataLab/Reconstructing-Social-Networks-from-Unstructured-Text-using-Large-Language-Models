We also have conducted a lecture/workshop to students of age 13-18, and observed that their overall acceptance of genetic engineering increased by introducing them to basic knowledge on the matter.

Please see the Registry help page on how to document a contribution to an existing part.

Your proof of concept must consist of a BioBrick device; a single BioBrick part cannot constitute a proof of concept. (biological materials may not be taken outside the lab).</TD><TD>Our ultimate goal was to create <I>E. coli</I> which can bind to NoV, and improved upon surface expression systems INPNC and BclA to achieve this. In detail, we enabled the purification and detection of the fusion protein by the addition of His tag, regardless of the passenger proteins placed downstream. Furthermore, we observed the binding of scFv surface expressing <I>E. coli</I> to NoVLP using SEM.

Demonstrate how your team has identified, investigated, and addressed one or more of these issues in the context of your project. Your activity could center around education, public engagement, public policy issues, public perception, or other activities (see the human practices hub for more information and examples of previous teams' exemplary work).</TD><TD>As one of the biggest obstacles synthetic biologists face outside of labs, we focused on improving public perceptions on genetic engineering. We engaged this problem by interacting with the general public and experts. We were shocked to learn how unrecognized iGEM and synthetic biology were, and thus have attempted to improve its recognition through multiple channels.
