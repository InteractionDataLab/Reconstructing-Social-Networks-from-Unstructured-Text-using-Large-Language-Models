Overview
We developed a software named "KELN": Kyoto-team Electronic Lab Note.          Ever felt it difficult to write tables in HTML documents? KELN is the solution! KELN provides user-friendly graphical user interface so that those who don't know HTML tags can make tables in HTML documents very easily!
Background story
Before we developed this software, it took a long time to write HTML documents such as tables of our lab notes. Because not all of us are a HTML expert, it was a heavy burden on the experts to do all the work. How wonderful it would be if we could assign this work to all the members in our team?
Improvements
Speed
KELN improved writing speed dramatically.
Consistency
You don't have to worry about syntax errors. All files generated by KELN are formatted in the same way, including class tags for customizing their appearance.
User's voice
The user interface was very natural, and the time-consuming work of writing HTML codes were significantly shortened
