#1 Integrated Human Practices
Expand on your silver medal activity by demonstrating how you have integrated the investigated issues into the design and/or execution of your project.
Faced with the people's overwhelming concerns regarding the application of genetic engineering, we strived to improve upon our project design of Noro-catcher and introduced a new module to increase its safety. We also have conducted a lecture/workshop to students of age 13-18, and observed that their overall acceptance of genetic engineering increased by introducing them to basic knowledge on the matter. Visit Integrated Practices and HP/Gold for details.
#2 Improve a previous part or project
Improve the function OR characterization of an existing BioBrick Part or Device and enter this information in the Registry. Please see the Registry help page on how to document a contribution to an existing part. This part must NOT be from your 2016 part number range.
We enhanced iGEM12_Penn's INPNC-MCS to INPNC-6xHistag and improved its function. Visit the original parts page and our enhanced parts page for details
#3 Proof of concept
Demonstrate a functional proof of concept of your project. Your proof of concept must consist of a BioBrick device; a single BioBrick part cannot constitute a proof of concept. (biological materials may not be taken outside the lab).
Our ultimate goal was to create E. coli which can bind to NoV, and improved upon surface expression systems INPNC and BclA to achieve this. In detail, we enabled the purification and detection of the fusion protein by the addition of His tag, regardless of the passenger proteins placed downstream. Furthermore, we observed the binding of scFv surface expressing E. coli to NoVLP using SEM. Visit our Proof of concept and Parts for details.

#1 Validated Part / Validated Contribution
Experimentally validate that at least one new BioBrick Part or Device of your own design and construction works as expected. Document the characterization of this part in the Main Page section of that Part's/Device's Registry entry. Submit this new part to the iGEM Parts Registry. This working part must be different from the part documented in bronze medal criterion #4.
We experimentally validated the following parts of our design and construction.

#2 Collaboration
Convince the judges you have helped any registered iGEM team from high school, a different track, another university, or another institution in a significant way by, for example, mentoring a new team, characterizing a part, debugging a construct, modeling/simulating their system or helping validate a software/hardware solution to a synbio problem.
We provided other iGEM teams with a wiki-creation support software that we have programmed, KELN, and improved its designs based on their feedback. Visit our Collaboration for details.
#3 Human Practices
iGEM projects involve important questions beyond the lab bench, for example relating to (but not limited to) ethics, sustainability, social justice, safety, security, and intellectual property rights. Demonstrate how your team has identified, investigated, and addressed one or more of these issues in the context of your project. Your activity could center around education, public engagement, public policy issues, public perception, or other activities (see the human practices hub for more information and examples of previous teams' exemplary work).
As one of the biggest obstacles synthetic biologists face outside of labs, we focused on improving public perceptions on genetic engineering. We engaged this problem by interacting with the general public and experts. We were shocked to learn how unrecognized iGEM and synthetic biology were, and thus have attempted to improve its recognition through multiple channels. Visit our HP/Silver for details.

#1 Register and attend
Register for iGEM, have a great summer, and attend the Giant Jamboree.
We have registered and are looking very forward to attending the Giant Jamboree! Visit our team page .
#2 Deliverables
Meet all deliverables on the Requirements page (section 3).
We met all!!
#3 Attribution
Create a page on your team wiki with clear attribution of each aspect of your project. This page must clearly attribute work done by the students and distinguish it from work done by others, including host labs, advisors, instructors, sponsors, professional website designers, artists, and commercial services.
We attributed all works done by outside collaborators accurately and thoroughly. Visit our Attribution .
#4 Part / Contribution
Document at least one new standard BioBrick Part or Device central to your project and submit this part to the iGEM Registry (submissions must adhere to the iGEM Registry guidelines). You may also document a new application of a BioBrick part from a previous iGEM year, adding that documentation to the part main page.
We submitted the following BioBrick parts to the iGEM Registry.
