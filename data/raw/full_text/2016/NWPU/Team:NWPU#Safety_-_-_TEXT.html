Safety
    The chassis we use in our project is E.coli, whose biosafety level is level-1. So it seems important to know the criteria of it in order to make sure that our experiment is carried out under a safe &non-pollution condition.
Biosafety Level 1[1]
     Biosafety Level 1 is suitable for work involving well-characterized agents not known to                 consistently cause disease in immunocompetent adult humans, and present minimal                 potential hazard to laboratory personnel and the environment. BSL-1 laboratories                 are not necessarily separated from the general traffic patterns in the building.                 Work is typically conducted on open bench tops using standard microbiological                 practices. Special containment equipment or facility design is not required,                 but may be used as determined by appropriate risk assessment. Laboratory personnel                 must have specific training in the procedures conducted in the laboratory and must                 be supervised by a scientist with training in microbiology or a related science.The                 following standard practices, safety equipment, apply to BSL-1.
A. Standard Microbiological Practices:
     The laboratory supervisor must enforce the institutional policies that control access to the laboratory.
     Persons must wash their hands after working with potentially hazardous materials and before leaving the laboratory.
     Eating, drinking, smoking, handling contact lenses, applying cosmetics, and storing food for human consumption must not be permitted in laboratory areas.
     Mouth pipetting is prohibited; mechanical pipetting devices must be used.
     Policies for the safe handling of sharps, such as needles, scalpels, pipettes, and broken glassware must be developed and implemented. 
     Perform all procedures to minimize the creation of splashes  and/or aerosols.
     Decontaminate work surfaces after completion of work and after any spill or splash of potentially infectious material with appropriate disinfectant.Decontaminate all cultures, stocks, and other potentially infectious materials before disposal using an effective method.

B. Special Practices
    None required.
C. Safety Equipment (Primary Barriers and Personal Protective Equipment)
     Special containment devices or equipment, such as BSCs, are not generally required.
     Protective laboratory coats, gowns, or uniforms are recommended to prevent contamination of personal clothing.
     Wear protective eyewear when conducting procedures that have the potential to create splashes of microorganisms or other hazardous materials. Persons who wear contact lenses in laboratories should also wear eye protection.
     Gloves must be worn to protect hands from exposure to hazardous materials. Glove selection should be based on an appropriate risk assessment. Alternatives to latex gloves should be available. Wash hands prior to leaving the laboratory. 
Risks & Safety precautions of Formaldehyde in laboratory[3]
     Formaldehyde is the sole carbon source in our project, which means that we will always use it to carry out our experiment. So we have to make sure about the risks&Safety precautions of formaldehyde in case of the toxic material.
Formaldehyde stick model.[4]
     Formaldehyde is toxic and can coagulate proteins. After contacting with the skin, it have a strong stimulating effect on mucous and membranes. This product is combustible as well as a  Class B fire hazardous substances, so fire and smoking should be prohibited. The steam and air mixtures will explosive under the temperature more than 600℃.Water can be used to put out the fire.
