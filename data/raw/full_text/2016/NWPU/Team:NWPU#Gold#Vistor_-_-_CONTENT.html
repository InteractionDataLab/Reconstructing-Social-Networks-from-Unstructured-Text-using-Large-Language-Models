Its purpose is to promote the exchange and cooperation between the participating teams ,and take the opportunity to further promote the synthesis of biology to domestic colleges and universities. The CCiC was hosted by Sun Yat-sen University. More than 30 iGEM teams, including Peking University, Tianjin University, Zhejiang University and National University of Defense Technology, participated in this exchange. The event was held just like the iGEM Giant Jamboree which provided a platform for the participants to participate in the research. It focused on the topics of lectures, poster presentations and team-to-team exchanges.    During the exchange, the iGEM's team members of our university and other iGEM teams conducted the extensive and in-depth exchanges, and carefully studied other teams in team management, project creation, experiment development, mathematical modeling, project packaging, English speech, PPT and poster and other aspects of mature experience.    On the morning of September 4th, our team presented this year's project - &quot;Blue Leaf&quot;. We introduced specifically the background of the project, the overview of the project, the experimental process and the results of the project. In the Q &amp; A session, the judges and other teams confirmed the NWPU progressing in the implementation of the project, the experimental results and PPT presentation and other aspects of the work. They also offered valuable suggestions on the overall packaging of the project and the next step experimental ideas.</P><H5><CENTER><STRONG>All the participants took a group photo after the closing ceremony</STRONG></CENTER></H5><H4 id="HUST" style="line-height: 40px; color: #2b669a;"><CENTER><STRONG>HUST-China</STRONG></CENTER></H4><P style="font-size: 16px;">    In the morning of 22,May,2016,we arrived at the school of life science and technology of Huazhong University of Science and Technology. HUST-China has attended the IGEM competition 5 times and made great achievements. In 2015, they won the gold medal and the &quot;Best parts&quot; single award nomination with outstanding performance such as novel project topics and well completeness, standing out in the same session of the domestic team. The captain Cheng unreservedly shared their experience to us, not only what new software tools they intended to use this year to build the wiki, but also the mistakes they have made when signed in the visa. Surprise and laughter could be heard during the communication. After the meeting, captain took us to visit their laboratories and showed us the &quot;kits&quot; standard parts sample sent by the official last year. Through the communication and learning with HUST-China, we have a more detailed understanding of wiki construction and transactional work such as visa. We really appreciate them.

Chu Pan , the leader of HZAU-China, offered a warm reception to us with other HZAU-China team members. Chu Pan first took us to visit their independent iGEM lab and introduced the basic situation of the laboratory. They patiently answered our questions and unreservedly shared their experience with us. For example, they advised us that if a suitable modeling breakthrough is not found, we can loop modeling pathway of the entire gene pathway. After more than three hours of communication, we had a more detailed understanding of the whole process of preparation. Our visit to HZAU-China came to an end after taking a photo of the whole group. What deeply moved us is that they specially asked one of their members to lead us to the bus station in case that we may lost.

We were warmly welcomed by two students in charge of Wuhan University iGEM team. On the first floor of the conference room, the Wuhan University iGEM team captain Mu Tianchen introduced the experience over the years in the form of PPT and showed us the PPT used in the last year’s IGEM. we seemed to have experienced a project presentation when captain Mou showed us the PPT. Captain Mou reminded us to pay attention to mathematical modeling,submit the material ahead of time , ensure the material be uploaded in time in case of the server congestion, try to use the new gene connection method and efficient gene splicing to start the loop debugging earlier and other specific issues. After the captain Mu led us to visit their spacious laboratory , they gave us a badge which was the made last year as a souvenir. Finally, we took a picture in front of the school of Life Sciences and the gate of Wuhan University.

A profound exchange was carried out. The iGEM team of Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University first time attended the iGEM competition in 2015 and won the bronze medal. We are the first time in 2016 iGEM competition. FAFU-CHINA new experience of attending the iGEM competition for the first time is a good reference for us.    The iGEM team of Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University led us to go through the last year's valuable experience. They reminded the arrangements of the staffing of us and introduced their experience of attending Giant Jamboree last year. Then, they led us to visit their lab.

Peking University is one of the four universities that first participated in iGEM competition. The iGEM team of Peking University is a top team in China. They had outstanding performance in all aspects of the competiton, which is worth learning.    Captain Li Cheng took us to visit the laboratory of Peking University iGEM. We asked them about the preparation of the late stage of the competition, such as project arranging, presentation, and Parts mailing. They guided us with great patience and offered many valuable opinions.
