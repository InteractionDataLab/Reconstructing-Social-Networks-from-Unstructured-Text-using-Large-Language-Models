This year, our Human Practices focused on the following areas.
      First of all, as the first time to participate in iGEM, we lack experience.             In order to be more effective in preparing for the competition, we actively             contacted with other excellent team, visited their school to ask how to prepare             for iGEM. These teams included: Peking, HZAU-China, HUST-China, FAFU-CHINA,             WHU-China (2015). In addition, we also participated in the 2016CCiC (Central             China iGEM Consortium), and exchanged ideas with the participants of the 30             other teams, receiving a lot of valuable experience and advice.  
      Secondly, in view of the overall design and experimental design of the project,             we contacted with Jiang Huifeng, a researcher of Tianjin Institute of Industrial             Biotechnology and Chinese Academy of Sciences, and Kang Peng, a Professor of             Technical Institute of Physics and Chemistry CAS . And we went to the laboratory             to study the related mature theories and experimental techniques of Blue Leaf.  
      In addition, because it is the first time for us to participate in this             competition, the students around and teachers from other schools of our             university didn’t know much about synthetic biology and iGEM. In order to promote iGEM and synthetic biology, we conducted three preach activities.
      Finally, as the sponsor and the main planner, we jointly organized             "Talk with LanZhou, Talk about iGEM" online live sharing activities             with LanZhou iGEM team. We used network live platform which is very             popular and mature at present, beyond the limitations of traditional             lectures. In the live, conversation was taken place between LanZhou             iGEM team members and online audience, to introduce their project.             LanZhou iGEM team members answered the questions asked by the audience.             In just one hour, we got 1100+ hits, which has made a very good publicity             display effect.
