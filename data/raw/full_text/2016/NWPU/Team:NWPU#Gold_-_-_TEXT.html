As a Beginner, Be a Learner.
    As the first time to participate in iGEM, we lack experience.             In order to be more effective in preparing for the competition,             we actively contacted with other excellent team, visited their             school to ask how to prepare for iGEM. These teams include: Peking, HZAU-China, HUST-China, FAFU-CHINA, WHU-China (2015).
We took photos with Peking team for memorial after the visit.
     In addition, we also participated in the 2016CCiC (Central China             iGEM Consortium), and exchanged ideas with the participants of             the 30 other teams, receiving a lot of valuable experience and advice.
All the participants took a group photo after the closing ceremony
     In view of the overall design and experimental design of the project,             we contacted with Jiang Huifeng, a researcher of Tianjin Institute             of Industrial Biotechnology of Chinese Academy of Sciences, and Kang             Peng, a Proffessor of Technical Institute of Physics and Chemistry CAS.             And we went to the laboratory to study the related mature theories and             experimental techniques of Blue Leaf.
As a Beginner, Be a Communicator.
    Because it is             the first time for us to participate in this competition, the             students around and teachers from other schools of our university             do not know much about synthetic biology and iGEM. In order to             promote iGEM and synthetic biology, we conducted three preach             activities. On the one hand, it attracted students from other             schools look down upon biology. On the one hand, it also letted             the teachers and students around us know that we are participating             in a very meaningful competition.
     At present, the high advancement of the Internet makes             information dissemination and exchange become fast and             convenient. In recent years, the rise of the network             video broadcast, makes three-dimensional exchange become             vivid, more time-sensitive. This year iGEM also called             on each iGEMor to "Be Social". As the sponsor and the main             planner, we jointly organized "Talk with LanZhou, Talk about             iGEM" online live sharing activities with LanZhou iGEM team.             We used network live platform which is very popular and mature             at present, beyond the limitations of traditional lectures.             In the live, conversation was taken place between LanZhou iGEM             team members and on-site audience, to introduce their entries. LanZhou iGEM team members answered the questions asked by the             audience. In just one hour, we got 1100+ hits, which has made             a very good publicity display effect. We hope to show our work             and discuss with classmates, friends and family about our project             in time in a special way.
In just one hour, we got 1100+ hits, 3,6000+upvote.
