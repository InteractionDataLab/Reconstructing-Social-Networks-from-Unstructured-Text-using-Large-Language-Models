Technical Institute of Physics and Chemistry CAS
In the first part of BlueLeaf, we designed the conversion of CO2 to formic acid by electro-conversion to obtain precursors for formaldehyde production. In order to better understand the electrical conversion technology and the structure and function of micro-electric conversion device, we came to the Technical Institute of Physics and Chemistry of CAS to learn electric conversion technology from researcher Kang Peng on September 27. Researcher Kang Peng’s main research direction is the rational design of carbon dioxide reduction catalyst and catalytic mechanism. He told us the principle of fixed carbon dioxide conversion, the benefits of using electricity to produce formic acid, the current status of research and future development prospects. In addition, Kang showed us the miniature electric conversion devices in their labs and demonstrated the operation of the conversion devices in the lab. We are(were) deeply surprised by the magic of electrochemical technology.
TIB Yeast Genomic Engineering Lab
In May of this year, when we were troubled in how to prepare for the Blue Leaf project, we had the honor to contact with Jiang Huifeng, a researcher at Tianjin Institute of Industrial Biotechnology and Chinese Academy of Sciences. Guided by Jiang, we identified a specific experimental program. At the same time, we were invited to TIB Yeast Genomic Engineering Lab, visiting the first-class modern biology laboratory, learning the specific laboratory practices and experimental procedures. Mr. Jiang gave us a lot of practical guidance and suggestions, which helped our young team grow rapidly.
