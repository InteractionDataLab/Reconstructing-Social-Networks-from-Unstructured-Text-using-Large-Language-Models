Introduction
     In the nature, in addition to the green plants and algae, almost none of the species can transform one-carbon compounds as a Multi-carbon compounds. Even the AACHEN 2015 project could not synthesize Glycogen using one-carbon compounds as the carbon source. So it is not suitable for the closed-loop system in the spacecraft.
    Using one-carbon compounds to synthesize a pentose becomes the last piece but the most important piece of the puzzle in the whole system.
    This year, we designed a new and unproven pathway to synthesize a pentose. This way is capable of condensing formaldehyde into D-xylulose. We used two enzymes with different condensation functions, BFD enzyme and TalB enzyme. The former can condense formaldehyde into two intermediate products: dihydroxyacetone and hydroxyacetaldehyde. And the latter can condense the two intermediate products into five-carbon saccharide compounds, D-xylulose. For such a Multiple enzyme - catalyzed reactions, we used multi-enzyme self-assembly protein scaffold technology to improve the efficiency of this reaction.
    Therefore, this year our goal are:
To verify the new way of synthesizing D-xylulose.
To test whether the multi-enzyme self-assembly protein scaffold technology can improve the efficiency of synthesizing D-xylulose.
    Our biological experiments also revolved around the two goals.
Experiments
    Our experiments include the following sections:
in Vitro:
    The fusion protein expression technology with His-tag was purified to obtain BFD enzyme and TalB enzyme respectively, and the extracellular enzyme reaction experiment was carried out to verify the function of these two enzymes, thus to verify the pathway of synthesizing D-xylulose.
Scaffold:
    Scaffold expression vector was constructed and the extracellular enzyme reaction was performed to test whether the multi-enzyme self-assembly protein scaffold technology could improve the efficiency of synthesizing D-xylulose.
in vivo
    The alive cells expressing BFD enzyme and TalB enzyme reacted with the substrate directly for intracellular reaction experiments. In addition, a multicistronic expression vector with BFD enzyme and TalB enzyme sequence was constructed, BTT. The intracellular reaction experiment was carried out to further validate the new pathway synthesizing D-xylulose .
Results
We used High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) to test the intermediates and D-xylulose and used SDS-PAGE to check whether the enzyme was normally expressed.             The experimental results and analysis are as follows:
in Vitro:
Benzoylformate Decarboxylase (BFD)
The purified protein was analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The result showed that E. coli expressed BFD enzyme normally.

We made a reaction system with formaldehyde and BFD pure enzyme, and detected it by HPLC after the reaction ceased. The results showed that BFD enzyme could  condense formaldehyde into dihydroxyacetone and hydroxyacetaldehyde.

We purified the reaction mixture containing BFD pure enzyme and intermediate products and TalB pure enzyme into the reaction system，                             and detected it by HPLC . The results showed that TalB enzyme can                             transform the two intermediate products, dihydroxy acetone and                             hydroxy acetaldehyde into D-xylulose by condensation reaction.

Conclusion
From the above experimental results we can confirm that the new                             pathway we designed to synthesize D-xylulose is effective. Using the                             BFD enzyme and TalB enzyme did transform formaldehyde into D-xyxulose by condensation reaction.
In addition, the reaction parameters were optimized by summing                             up the results of previous experiments. That made the conversion                             efficiency from formaldehyde to D-xylulose improved to 4.78%.

The results of HPLC showed that BFD enzyme and TalB enzyme could synthesize D-xylulose by formaldehyde with the help of protein scaffold, and the highest conversion rate was 14.02% ,which is three times of conversion rate when the scaffold protein was not used!

Analysis
In fact, D-xylulose is a pentose that provides heat. It can be catabolized by E.coli through the pentose phosphate. It can be through the pentose phosphate by E.coli catabolism. We constructed the mathematical model for the metabolic pathways in vivo, and the results showed that the synthesized D-xylulose was quickly phosphorylated and broken down by the pathway of pentose phosphate.
Conclusion
According to the results of our in vitro pure enzyme experiments                             in vitro, it was confirmed that BFD and TalB enzymes could                             synthesize D-xylulose by formaldehyde. we could also detect the                             normal expression of both enzymes, as well as the interpretation                             derived from modeling results. We were able to conclude                             that the use of viable bacteria can also be used to synthesize                             D-xylulose by formaldehyde.
Summary
We used High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) to test the intermediates and D-xylulose and used SDS-PAGE to check whether the enzyme was normally expressed.             Based on the above experimental results, we could determine that we achieved our desired goals.
The new D-xylulose synthesis pathway we designed is effective. The use of BFD enzyme and TalB enzyme could transform the formaldehyde into the D-xylulose by condensation reaction.
The multi-enzyme self-assembled protein scaffolds used in this project could greatly improve the efficiency of synthesizing D-xylulose
