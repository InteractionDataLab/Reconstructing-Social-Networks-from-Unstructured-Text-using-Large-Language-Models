ATTRIBUTIONS
Daria Niewiadomska: was involved in the multipromoter expression system project. She was in charge of assembling constructs and measuring the promoters’ strength (fluorescence measurements). Daria also contributed to Wiki content: methods, ethical issues and patenting. She described some biobricks, created a part of presentation and conducted classes during workshops. What is more she also prepared survey for human practices.
Julia Zielińska: was involved in the multipromoter expression system project. She was in charge of assembling constructs with E1 enhancer and altered UTRs. She also performed promoters’ activity measurements and data analysis. She prepared our poster and description of sfGFP and mRFP production and purification, as well as galleries and illustrations for wiki. She wrote the promoters’ notebook, descriptions of our project, results and biobricks. She designed the team’s logo and banner.
Maja Szymańska: was involved in the “open reading frame project”. She was in charge of assembling constructs and measuring the fluorescence of proteins synthesized by various mRNAs. She was also responsible for creating and organizing workshops for students (over 230 high school students!). She prepared ORFs’ notebook and human practices description.
Adrian Lejman: was involved in the “open reading frame project”. He was in charge of assembling constructs and measuring the fluorescence of proteins synthesized by various mRNAs. His main task was also creation of our Wiki. He prepared description of safety in our lab and took part in workshops for high school students.
Marcin Osuch: helped in measurements and analyzed the survey results. Together with Max they were responsible for validation of chosen existing BioBrick Parts in order to confirm if they really work as described.
Max Olbrich: together with Marcin, they were responsible for validation of chosen existing BioBrick Parts in order to confirm if they really work as described. He also described the Medal Criteria section.
Melania Nowicka: was responsible for ORF design, especially for protein expression optimization which includes: different codon and codon pair frequency rankings preparation, codon context optimization (using the software which is the result of her Master's Thesis) taking A-homopolymers and restriction enzymes sites removal. As an advisor she helped describing the dry lab part of the project.
Jakub Bartoszewicz: helped crossing the language barrier by proofreading, suggesting refinements and commenting on the Wiki’s content. He had also teamed up with Melania to ensure optimal mRNA secondary structures of some of the designed ORFs.
Przemysław Nuc: was the mastermind of our project! He motivated us when we started to doubt ourselves. He helped us enormously with the experimental part of the project and was filled with ideas on how to improve our work. He also faced the painstaking work connected with ordering lab reagents and fulfilling contracts.
SUPPORTERS
Sergiusz Zieliński: helped us to understand html language, because a few months ago none of us knew what CSS or HTML was. Thanks to him we were able to build our Wiki.
Iwona Kanonik-Jędrzejak: Mrs. Iwona assisted us with fuliffiling countless forms regarding funding, plane tickets or hotel booking.
