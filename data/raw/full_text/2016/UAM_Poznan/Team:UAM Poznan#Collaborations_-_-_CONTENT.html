We completely agree with this opinion- people don’t like taking surveys... We had that feeling when we were conducting our survey about GMO- it was hard to convince people to write answers longer than one word. That’s why we were not wondering much whether or not to fill team’s LMU-TUM Munich questionnaire. We know how time consuming good survey preparation can be, not to even mention data analysis! So fully understanding what kind of task it is, we filled their survey entitled ‘Enabling Factors in Biotech’ with pleasure. 
The survey contained many inspiring questions, which really allowed us to look at our project from a different point of view. Despite the fact that our group didn’t write business plan during  iGEM project, now when we see our promising results, we are starting to think about business founding. The survey focused our attention on very important issues, it visualized us that if we want to start our own business we should assess e.g. marketability of our project, define the size of the market and market competition. Thanks for this Hallie!
We hope that our answers and whole obtained data will really help to promote the success of iGEM participants among scientific community.</P><H2>meeting in Paris - the European Experience </H2><P align="justify">At the beginning of July (2-3 July 2016) three members of our iGEM team (Marcin, Adrian and Maja) participated in the European Experience in Paris. It was our first contact with the other iGEM teams from Europe. The meeting was organized by two French groups: iGEM EVRY and iGEM IONIS. There was a poster session- it was a great possibility to exchange the ideas of our projects, ask questions and create collaborations. Our poster presented an expression system induced by sugars as well as our preliminary results connected with the dependence of the codon content on the fluorescence protein production. Then we took part in two synthetic biology conferences with researches from France. They raised interesting topics such as economical and ethical issues in synthetic biology. In the evening there was a party, which was another opportunity to get to know better with other European teams. This conference gave us the opportunity to explain our iGEM project to the others.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
